<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> good one, original and smell very good ...</li>
    <li> I love this cologne and buy it over and over for my husband. The scent is great and makes me feel like I want to hold him forever.</li>
    <li> Fast, excellent service! Thank you for the free gifts and new fragrance sample. I wlll be you loyal customer for life.  Keep it up.  BTW, any ny new samples for men&#x27;s fragrances?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos Feliciano</li>
    <li> I thought would be like most of Versace&#x27;s  fragrances but actually this is a very mild almost sweet fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s okay but never again for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, but find myself sneaking a spray or two, just because it smells so good! Coming back for more!</li>
    <li> Excellent, great buy.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this cologne a few years ago and wanted some more of it. I love it</li>
    <li> Being a collector of fragrances I have to admit that Dreamer caught my eye and after reading nothing but positive reviews I ordered myself a sample. About a week later I got my sample in the mail and sprayed it on my arm. My first whiff of the Dreamer was far from stellar, to be honest it was terrible. I read somewhere that it starts off harsh but the dry-down is amazing. Sure enough I waited about an hour and to my dismay the scent got even worse. If you are thinking about blind buying this little devil be sure to order a sample, DO NOT BLIND BUY VERSACE THE DREAMER. You have been warned. This Eau de Toilette is so powdery that I swear it&#x27;s geared towards older women. I can&#x27;t even pick up the tobacco notes because the powder overwhelms my nose giving me extreme headaches. If you dislike the smell of Powdery scents (like the ones on top of your Grandmother&#x27;s dresser drawers) then stay far away from this bottle of stink.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great! It has a very sweet tobacco smell and is a lot more masculine smelling than other Versace cologne&#x27;s I&#x27;ve smelled. Blue Jeans was my favorite from Versace but The Dreamer now holds that title. It is reminiscent of JPG Le Male and the tobacco reminds me a bit of D&amp;B Pour Homme. It&#x27;s like the 2 colognes had cologne babies and those babies grew up to become a scent better than it&#x27;s parents. Easily lasts 8 hours on me.</li>
    <li> Typically I&#x27;m a big fan of Versace colognes but not this one. Dreamer goes on with a heavy floral top note reminiscent of a classic perfume for women.  After a few minutes the floral tones down a bit and matures into a light tobacco scent but not enough to offset the floral.  Not for me!  I&#x27;ll stick with Versace&#x27;s Pour Homme or Eau Fraiche.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne since it went on the market. It is my top favorite cologne from Versace. I love the fresh clean fragrance and people are always asking me \\&quot;what are you wearing?\\&quot; It lasts a long time on my skin and I love that. I put it on in the morning and 8 hours later I can still smell it.</li>
    <li> Its a unique perfume. Don&#x27;t judge this by its top note; I do agree that the top note is kind of nauseating, but once it settles down after maybe 15 min, it starts smelling really good. Try it out, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Every time I squirt the thing cologne was running out. I pulled the top off and realized that the spout was cracked so I replaced it with the empty bottle I replaced. Only thing that sucks is I can&#x27;t get the gold top back on it without potentially cracking the good spout. Very convenient to just re-order when I run out. This can&#x27;t happen again though. If so I am done and will find it elsewhere..</li>
    <li> This scent may seem odd at first but it is not like any other ive ever smelled. It sort of puts you in a trance to smell it. As though you never want to stop smelling it. I find myself taking extra breath sometimes just to catch the scent haha. 5 stars. Oh. And the women seem to love it. I got 4 compliments on the scent the first day I wore it! A girl even told me that I was probably the best smelling guy shes ever met haha.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. It smells divine on him! The scent is fairly light, not heavy or musky. It doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I wish, though.</li>
    <li> If you want something unique that smells good and not everyone will have, get this. It is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I blindly bought this one after reading positive reviews of many other reviewers. Yes, it&#x27;s a very good scent. It reminds me of the late nineties I don&#x27;t know why. Maybe I smelled it for the first time back then and yes, it&#x27;s not a new scent for me even though I didn&#x27;t knew it by its name and I figured it as soon as I sprayed it. It&#x27;s kind of sweet but not too much, it&#x27;s fresh but does has character. Definitelly sexy. Not as elegant as Cartier&#x27;s Declaration but kind of sober in its own way and don&#x27;t know how to say it but... could I say it&#x27;s kind of a happy scent? If I was to frame it by age of the possible user I would give it a mid twenties and older. It&#x27;s not sporty, its classy but modern at the same time. It does last the whole day but doesn&#x27;t scream it&#x27;s presence. Anyway it has its name well placed... its a dream of a scent.    Highly commendable. Go for it and you won&#x27;t be dissapointed</li>
    <li> Great Product at a Great Rate. Smells Wonderful. Seller was efficient and honest. Greatly Satisfied.</li>
    <li> Husband loved this fragrance, great price!</li>
    <li> I Bought this for my husband for father&#x27;s day, smells absolutely great and arrived sooner then expected. will definately recommend this.</li>
    <li> Nice product but the only problem is that it take to long to arrive... thats all</li>
    <li> Hands down best cologne I have ever smelled. Ordered off Amazon and got it fairly quickly. Some people dislike the opening but I love it, and the dry down is unlike any other fragrance I have tried. Very unique, very different; gets me more compliments then Azzaro Chrome or Terre D&#x27;Hermes. This one is my signature scent.</li>
    <li> Scent is as I remember it -mystical and unique. Receive many female comments as to what I am wearing-an all day and lasting fragrance.  Scent is hard to describe-for the price-try it.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. So many compliments.</li>
    <li> Love! Classic cologne!</li>
    <li> When I first sprayed the opening of this fragrance on my skin I must admit I was a bit disappointed.  Way brighter and sweeter than I had imagined. Just a bit overwhelming.  After having this for a few weeks my opinion has totally changed.  This is a fragrance that is so unique and straight out classy that it has that potential to grow on you which it did for me.  I even enjoy the opening now but like so many people say when the base notes come out it turns into a very clean fresh earthy scent with a touch of sweetness which smells great.  The biggest mistake you could make is to just buy this expecting everybody is going to compliment you on it.  It doesn&#x27;t work that way lol  No fragrance in existence works that way.  Is everybody going to like it? Absolutely not.  But I truly believe most people would especially if you wear it for the right occasion.  For dating purposes, holidays, special occasions you can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance.  Actually you honestly can&#x27;t go wrong wearing it for anything. lol  Its just that unique and non-linear.  This is a definite winner in my book.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments everytime I wear this cologne. It smells so good and good projection and lomgevity.</li>
    <li> I bought this directly from Amazon.  It smells great for at least 18 hours on my skin.  I can&#x27;t believe this fragrance lasts so long.  Women love it and it has excellent sillage.  3 sprays is more than enough.</li>
    <li> This is a Versace classic and a lot of his fragrances have some incorporation of it. I bought this on recommendation without smelling. The price makes it a bargain but for someone who prefers woody fragrances, I found this too sweet.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best perfume created. I love its smell, if you can buy one, you won&#x27;t regret buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
    <li> This product is different in a good way. I like it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My best friend recommended this scent to me when asking her some of her favorites for her husband. I bought this for him as a gift and feel like it&#x27;s more a gift to me than him. lol. I love the smell. It&#x27;s perfect. Not to much or little. You can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere. I do recommend to only buy from Amazon though. I&#x27;m pretty new to Amazon (Ebay I&#x27;ve used for years). My original order never arrived and when I contacted the seller they had a said it was left at the door.That was all they had to offer me. I looked all over my Amazon account and couldn&#x27;t find the address they delivered it to anywhere (though I know it was true because it was my past address. I just couldn&#x27;t find it to fix it. Weird. It was unfortunately sent to my old address. Nonetheless, that was my bad. I couldn&#x27;t even find anywhere on my account to fix the address error. I had to contact Amazon and they changed it for me. Since I hadn&#x27;t purchased it from Amazon, but some other seller on their site I had to wait 30 days to file saying I never received the item before they took any action. The seller was very unhelpful with trying to help me resolve the issue. I even went to my old home and asked the new tenants if they had received it. Amazon was helpful once the required allotted time had past. I now only purchase things directly from Amazon.They sent me one and I love the smell on my man! I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s a great gift idea</li>
    <li> I had never used this cologne before, and I admit, at first I did not like it, but then I realised the complexity of the cologne and changed my initial opinion. This is a very powerful cologne! In a good way. Dreamer does not weaken several hours later. I would use it very conservatively for day wear, because it will last well into the evening. Dreamer has history, having been released in 1997, and I can see why Dreamer has loyal customers. The scents are a delight. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re dating yourself. Most ladies love it, too, because it is very masculine and exotic. There are evergreen notes from juniper berries, much like an exotic gin, with lilly and iris fragrances. A very strong amber and tobacco scent provides the backbone, giving it, overall, an admixture with a Christmas-esque bouquet, not unlike gingerbread cookies or brown sugar. It&#x27;s simply wonderful. If you are looking for something that is bold, go with Dreamer. I suggest Versace Man or Armani Code as a primer, as they are also very classy colognes for those who are new to colognes. Don&#x27;t overuse them, or any cologne, though! And please, don&#x27;t waste your money on low-end cologne. you get what you pay for. Stick with the designer brands. These folks (Chanel, Armani, Givenchy, Gucci, Versace, Burberry, Bvlgari, etc.) know what they are doing, and aren&#x27;t showing up 5 minutes to midnight like some of these new scent designers.</li>
    <li> I tried this fragrance a few years ago when a store clerk recomended it (said it was everyone&#x27;s favorite in the store). Extremely soft and warm, Dreamer smells significantly different on skin than on paper (sample cards). I like it because it isn&#x27;t as sharp, flowery, and chemicle-smelling as most perfumes.</li>
    <li> Its nice.  A little sweet.  Nice bottle.  Got it for a good price (30)</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Get quite a few good comments</li>
    <li> I read lots of comments before ordered this one from Amazon. They said it is green, but when I opened the box, it was a normal water. Strange!!! I like the green one which forced me to buy this one. After that I sprayed a little bit on my hand, it smells really good. I like it and highly recommend for this cologn. One more thing, I wasted my hands with soap after I had pulled the trash container back to my house, and I still smell it. 6 stars would be given. want to buy more but have to wait....</li>
    <li> very nice smell, it is absolutely 100 real, great deal this particular bottle sells retail at the stores for about $75.00 plus tax</li>
    <li> You will get a compliment with this cologne every time you walk into somewhere new. A cologne you can spray on you multiple times a day without overdoing it with people around you.</li>
    <li> I buy scents for my husband by trying them on myself first - when I first sprayed on Dreamer I thought it was wonderful - unusual, but wonderful.  After it developed a while on my skin, I thought it was flat-out weird.  It definitely smells of tobacco, and a whole lot of other things, like sweetness mixed with, I don&#x27;t know what - auto tires?  It&#x27;s hard to describe, and I have a feeling it&#x27;s a love it or hate it type fragrance.  It lasted a long while on my skin and after about an hour or so I didn&#x27;t really care for it... but when I got home, I asked both my husband and my adult son to give it a sniff, and they both really liked it!  So I would recommend it for users who want a unique scent.</li>
    <li> Ok so this order got to me from Amazon in less than 24 hrs and I paid no shipping- that was crazy- so I know where to order cologne for now on.  First off, I&#x27;m a 35 year old man and have worn my decent share of cologne.  Some random cologne memories: loved Happy and Aqua di Gio and some of the Hugos.  Sort of liked Dirty English by Juicy, but the smell was a little too dirty.  I didn&#x27;t feel great wearing it- felt kind of edgy in it for whatever reason.  Certain smells can do that, I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now to Dreamer- I got Versace Dreamer about 5 hours ago and think I&#x27;ve worn it long enough to give an informed review.  This stuff is awesome.  Moschino Uomo was my favorite cologne in the past and I still wear that here and there.  I feel like Dreamer is a softer, more complete, happier, more seductive version of Uomo.  Uomo smells really good and unique and sexy and powerful- but it&#x27;s almost arrogant smelling when you compare it to Dreamer.  Also, Uomo doesn&#x27;t evolve as much throughout the day- it starts and ends about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Dreamer is a more sophisticated fragrance.  Over the last few hours, I feel like it has evolved into a clean, warm, comforting fragrance that kind of makes you feel good.  I know that sounds odd- but it is really the case.  With some cologne, you might wear it a few hours and then get tired of the smell.  I&#x27;ve had that in the past.  With Dreamer though, I feel like I could wear this day or night, to the office or out for play.  I&#x27;m sold- best cologne I&#x27;ve ever had and I think I&#x27;ll be wearing this bad-boy for years.</li>
    <li> Really bought in to this as a being a great cologne,...tried it...it&#x27;s almost a \\&quot;Yes\\&quot;, but it falls short.  It just doesn&#x27;t project well.... and needs a little something else....</li>
    <li> 100% original and great price, that&#x27;s all I need and all I received.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister for Christmas she LOVES this its the right size and it came super fast! I couldnt be happier my sister is gonna love it when she gets this for Christmas. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+!</li>
    <li> exactly what i expected.. smells great...</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes that are hard to find. Found it here with In seconds and fell in love with this purchase all over again.....</li>
    <li> Best cologne I have purchased!  I finally found a cologne that not only I enjoy, but my wife and people around me comment on every time I wear it.  It is not overbearing, but rather draws people in.  I have found people talking to me get closer than if I wear another cologne.  Shipping was fast and the price was great.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure of the scent the first time that I put this on.  But after a few minutes I loved it.  As the other reviewers have said, women LOVE the scent/smell of this.  One women told me last night when I was at a bar, that I was the best smelling man there.  I will for sure buy this again!</li>
    <li> This one has a very warm unique smell that is not too overpowering. I purchased this blind based off of friends and online reviews. I agree with other reviewers at first it has a very sweet opening. The heart is still very sweet and floral. What I think everyone loves about this fragrance is the base. The base is a warm Tonka bean - Tobacco (BTW I don&#x27;t smoke and hate the smell of cigarette smoke it&#x27;s not that kind of tobacco smell it&#x27;s a sweet sugary almost vanilla smell) The longevity of the one is very good too I can wear this all day without it fading. I think most people will like this one. I agree with other reviewers it does take a bit to get over the opening but from there it is amazing.</li>
    <li> this fragrance or aroma I should say is great, women on elevators stand close even when there&#x27;s no one else on board and the wife loves it. I don&#x27;t rock it every day, I want to mantain that WOW factor.......WOW</li>
    <li> Iam a girl that likes to wear some guys cologne and this is one of them at first like some said i didn&#x27;t like the smell but let it breeze throught the wind lol and a different smell will acour hello &amp;#34;dreamer&amp;#34; ;-) also others I like is chrome, really recommend hypnoze by Loncom and dolce cabana the original one</li>
    <li> great service and product</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cologne, smells heavenly.  I always purchase this for my husband and he always gets compliments on how good he smells.</li>
    <li> Bought for Christmas present for son in law, he loved it, price was terrific compared to department store.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this fragrance - and only wears this - thank you, Emily</li>
    <li> Smells a little feminine but barely. I would almost say its baby powder. The eomen at the bar or my work love it though. Worth the $26 I paid.</li>
    <li> The product name on amazon says \\&quot;Dreamer By Gianni Versace\\&quot; not \\&quot;THE Dreamer\\&quot; which obviusly means it is NOT an original... didn&#x27;t realized it until it had arrived and saw the packaging. I think that was misleading.. Wasn&#x27;t able to notice that through my phone.&lt;br /&gt;Money down the drain... Was really dissapointed to have gotten this.</li>
    <li> I was visiting a news channel here in NYC and one of the reporters was wearing this. My wife liked it so I purchased it and I am happy I did. I like is but more inportant My wife likes it (wink wink )</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne as a blind buy. The service was great, I just don&#x27;t like the scent of the cologne so much. It has a plastic scent mixed with fresh linen when you first spray it. After about an hour it&#x27;s not so harsh. It dries down a bit powdery. I would descibe the overal scent as, gothic, and mature. People under 30 probobaly won&#x27;t like this too much. To me &amp; a few people I asked, it smells like an older person scent.</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne. Bought this for my nephew has very particular taste in colognes. This one is just right. Smells GREAT!</li>
    <li> I hope we all understand that finding the right cologne can be hit or miss, the same cologne on different people react differently depending on chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;Versace&#x27;s Dreamer does have a very strong scent upon initial spray but the reviews have been quite accurate, the dry down is definitely to die for- this is more of an up-close and personal scent that I would use more for dates and would certainly be more of a cold weather/evening scent. It has a very complex, sweet yet masculine scent that is very hard to describe but must be experienced! I only wished I used this scent sooner.</li>
    <li> I chose 5 stars for several reasons. I read great reviews and I got an overall feeling that this cologne, though discontinued, was the real deal. That said, I contacted the seller to confirm that the bottle was new and not a &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; and to see how quickly the item would ship. I was contacted by the seller immediately and assured it was indeed a new bottle and that I should have it before my boyfriend&#x27;s bday which was only 3 days away, including a holiday. To my surprise I received it the very next day (without expedited shipping) and it appeared to be the original cologne. My boyfriend was so happy I found it and once he opened it, he made it clear it was the perfect scent with all the notes in the scent that made it so unique to him. I am not fond of cologne, but after he wore The Dreamer on my birthday and I asked him what it was, he mentioned he was low and had a hard time finding it. It smelled amazing on him... So I had to track it down.  I&#x27;ll be back and this store will be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for other rare finds in the future. Great service and product! YES!!!!</li>
    <li> This has been my fragrance that I have worn for over 10 years, I know the scent very well and was distraught when they discontinued it not too long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only cologne I have ever worn and I must say this is not the scent I know and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe it is the real thing, due to the packaging and the bottle, although it seems that it has been sitting somewhere for possible 2 years+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top notes do not smell the same at all, and why I am lead to believe the cologne has gone stale.</li>
    <li> Smells great, it&#x27;s the original scent, and a big 3.Oz bottle for a really great price. I love it, and would most definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love the Versace Pour Homme that I bought a couple of months ago based on a Men&#x27;s Health mag smell sample. Therefore, on this one I took a chance, sight unseen - fragrance unsmelled, but it truly smells like a female perfume. I&#x27;ll never wear it but I kept its packaging nice enough to gift it to someone I don&#x27;t know very well.</li>
    <li> i spray this holding it away because it is so strong. i would recommend this however! very pleasant smell. use cautiously.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for  many many years and I still think is the best.  Try it, you&amp;#34;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I guaranteed you this is not the Versace Dreamer. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes , love the smell .</li>
    <li> One of the colognes on the market.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this scent thru a friend!  fell in love with it all over again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I saw for it I thought it would be really good, but in my opinion I didnt think it smelled that good. I definitely thought it would be better. Kinda dissapointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Versace \\&quot;the Dreamer\\&quot; -- what can you say? I had moderately high expectations for this fragrance after reading some reviews, and they were not only met but exceeded. Some colognes are classy, fresh, professional, sensual... but seriously, the one word that comes to mind with this smell is SEXY! I mean, I would sleep with myself after smelling this. It is so simple when you look at the notes, yet so well done. Refined, semi-sweet, amazing longevity but does not exaggerate just to draw attention to yourself. I&#x27;m trying to come up with a situation where somebody could not wear this -- to no avail. These last few weeks with the temperature being around 90 it will disappear a little too quickly and project a little too much. This is a great fragrance to start your fall collection, or to make a great impression on that first date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have some pretty good projection and longevity so I would say to start off with three sprays maximum, and maybe build up from there. The tobacco and floral mixes very well at the beginning, and can actually be quite confusing, which gives the scent a perfect name! With the \\&quot;Goddess of Sleep\\&quot; as a signature, is hypnotic, but also wait for the dry down after about three hours returns very romantic. Definitely a must try, even a blind buy, but trust your nose and the compliments that you receive.</li>
    <li> I paid 33, and at the Duty Free it was 65.  Do not doubt in buying it.</li>
    <li> this is the stuff that dreams are made of. even tough this is a mans&#x27; cologne, I wear it. have been for a while now. it does change and smells different on everyone so I recommend it to anyone male or female.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
    <li> Nice long lasting scent, great scent for the winter season. I&#x27;m getting compliments everywhere I go. Highly recommended, it&#x27;s a magnet scent.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this one. The liquid is leaking while I am pumping in everytime. The worst thing is that I cannot return or replace it although it has such a huge flaw. It is sold by Amazon, but they say that &amp;#34;for safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34; I CANNOT understand the policy. I want to get my money back or get well-conditioned product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne on my husband....thanks!  It came quickly and smells great.</li>
    <li> this is pretty nice I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I like the smell not one of my tops but if i was hanging out with a girl then I would rock it for her</li>
    <li> Quality item at great price!  My son loved it...and it was the nicest of the colognes he received!  Totally recommend !</li>
    <li> Rare find in the public. Very good fragrance!</li>
    <li> This scent is great and I got at the right time of season for it; spring. I recommend this for those who like lighter scents.</li>
    <li> While it smells really nice, its projection is lacking a great deal. I was hoping for something that would really &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; and keep fluctuating as the day wears on, but it seems to last only 3 hours or so, before just smelling nice on your skin, but not emmanating outward. The opening is really strong and confident, and the cool down is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its worth $40, but its not the god send reviews made it out to be. If you want something better, you&#x27;ll likely have to pay more.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend wears this and has for a long time. It is heavenly. The first time I leaned in to hear him better (at a noisy bar) I was mesmerized by this spectacular scent. Women clammer when they smell this. His dad has even borrowed it and had to be careful because women were just about climbing over the counter to get to him he smelled so good. If you want something that smells great and not many have (not on shelves anymore - special order only) then go for this. I&#x27;m drooling just thinking about it.</li>
    <li> I receive mixed reviews about this cologne. Women either love it, or hate it. I would say the good comments outweigh the bad, but it still smells good. Its been around for a while, and I can honestly say that I have a good feeling about this cologne. The key to wearing this cologne the correct way is to spray once on each sleeve/wrist, and twice on the neck. That way, its not overbearing, but still gives a strong scent.</li>
    <li> i always have and always will love this scent, not just in the air or in the bottle but on my person as weil</li>
    <li> Was shockingly awed by the smell. I had mixed feelings at 1st because of how flowery it smelled. But after about 30 minutes, it bellows down to a sweet smelling scent. The ladies at work are intoxicated by the way it smells. They love it, and so do I.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think the low rating is because the fragrance isn&#x27;t great. Versace Dreamer is my absolute favorite of many colognes. However.... this just doesn&#x27;t get the same effect as all of my previous bottles I&#x27;ve owned over the past 10 years. This stuff used to stay in my clothes for days even after I&#x27;d wash my clothes there would be  a hint of it. With this bottle all I get is the strong pungent alcohol smell that most colognes give off in the beginning. After that goes away it never seems to mellow out and give off that vibe that I&#x27;ve been accustomed to. I&#x27;ll buy this again just not from amazon. I&#x27;ll stick to my local shops and pay a few bucks extra. It&#x27;s something tricky about this one here</li>
    <li> I love this scent! It never gets old! My hubby always gets complimented! Great gift! I highly recommend it!! : )</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim based on reviews soI had to try it. My guy loves it. He&#x27;d never smelled this scent before either and I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Perfect and not a knock off or counterfeit. It&#x27;s the real thing factory sealed! Reasonably priced and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong bottle I wasn&#x27;t satisfied but that was my fault.</li>
    <li> It smell very good. It is a perfect gift for a man. I must admit I am addicted to this perfume. And the price is quite good. I recommend it</li>
    <li> Great cologne! Smells wonderful it&#x27;s a neutral scent to me, for men or women. Im such a lady and i get compliments all the time. It arrived in 3 days. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great casual fragrance... but no quite romantic for an evening with the wife. It has a leather/smoke hint to it, but DOES NOT smell like a smoker.</li>
    <li> Dreamer is definitely a dream, loves this; would recommend to my friends; I always have to keep a bottle always!</li>
    <li> I received excellent service at a awesome price and I enjoy the product.</li>
    <li> The scent does not last too long maybe 2-3 hours , where the one I bought from Macy&#x27;s can last all day.</li>
    <li> I purchased from this seller, and the cologne is not authentic. This is one of my favorite cologne and I can tell the difference between the real one and the fake one. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!! I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a Christmas gift.  Nice smell for daytime use only.  There are better colognes out there though.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I recently wanted to expand beyond my old and paltry collection of Drakkar, Georgio RSVP (yes, I lived in the 80&#x27;s), and Kenneth Cole RSVP. So I bought the sampler of CK from Amazon (Obsession, Eternity, CK One, IN2U, and Euphoria). Euphoria was my favorite, IN2U was OK, and the other three made my eyes water. I then buckled down and got full size bottles of Versace Pour Homme, Cool Water, Alfred Sung, Versace Dreamer, and Very Irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dreamer and Very Irresistible smell almost like clones of each other. Versace for Men and Euphoria, are also pretty close, although Versace is much cleaner and more complex. Cool water is nice. That&#x27;s it. It is nice. Good for business or a night out with your sister. The rest of the CK line is too common. Alfred Sung is the woodsiest and most unique scent of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have Givenchy Very Irresistible for Men, don&#x27;t bother getting this. However, if you like Very Irresistible, and want something slightly different (a little more subtle), then pick this one up. You may have to use an extra spritz though. This scent is also recognized by more women (usually in a very good way) than some others.</li>
    <li> I always buy this cologne. I just bought it again and smells great but  what is weird is the box. Versace usualy is gold color and \\&quot;The\\&quot; from the \\&quot;The Dreamer\\&quot; is red. The one I bought is different; the colors are silver only and the way is written looks fake to me.I don&#x27;t know what to think.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from a suggestion of someone who reviews A LOT of fragrances. It certainly is a more musky, powdery, floral scent but it is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with 99 percent of people who buy this and say put this on ahead of time. This perfume is like a butterfly in that it transforms--It initially smells horrible in my opinion, but after 30 minutes to one hour it loses it&#x27;s harshness and is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this scent 4.5 just because I really don&#x27;t like the initial smell... but it becomes so much better as you wear it in a day that I think it makes up for that. It&#x27;s chemistry so I don&#x27;t think you can really fault the makers... It probably just works out like that to get that kind of smell.</li>
    <li> Why do I say \\&quot;No comments\\&quot; as my title?? Because I have never received one comment as to whether this product smells nice or bad. I purchased this after reading several reviews where woman have ranked it at the top of their list. Guess their family must be associated with the manufacturer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just sitting on my shelf at this time; only to be used when there is no one that I&#x27;m looking to impress.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this scent to much.</li>
    <li> Great and unique scent for a designer fragrance.  It is a romantic scent with decent projection and scent life.  I get about 8 hours.  The top notes can be quite strong and synthetic. I have come to enjoy them over time.  However, the dry down is fantastic and is well liked by almost everyone.  Considered to be unisex by many, but as a romantic scent it is perfect.  Women really like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: serves its purpose well.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it as an everyday signature scent, but is a great romantic fragrance for dates and other intimate times.</li>
    <li> i am 55yrs.old and was looking for a tobacco scent so i bought the dreamer.i feel like a 25 yr. old salesman wearing this.there is no way i can pull this off,no way. i have smelled this so many times on people and always thought it was soap. i think i smelled this on my favorite slut&#x27;s bed one time.it reminds me of those pheromone colognes that came out in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> If you like strong manly colognes, would strongly recommend. Spicier side, definitely attention grabbing. I would also recommend getting JPG&#x27;s le male if you want to add to your collection</li>
    <li> Long lasting and great opening. 5/5</li>
    <li> I LOVE THAT EAU TOILETTE PERFUME. I RECOMEND IT.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day, good initial scent, others like it on you. not sure if I&#x27;ll get it again, there&#x27;s a YSL scent I want to try</li>
    <li> I love the smile of this fragrance. It is very long lasting. I would buy again it was money well spent.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand cloying scents. Drakkar Noir got sprayed on me once at a department store and fifteen rubs with a giant chocolate chip cookie couldn&#x27;t get the crap off me. Admittedly, later that day two female friends both admitted a kind of attraction to me, but I have a feeling it was more due to the scent of the cookie than the Drakkar Noir.    But I digress. I buy scent so infrequently that it took me a lot of time to pick a scent I actually liked. I&#x27;d wear lavender panty spray if I liked the smell and/or liked how my body chemistry worked with it. I&#x27;d gleefully condense the odor of a llama if it worked for me and I was happy with smelling like a llama. However, i also don&#x27;t wear cologne like the average teenage male, with a fuggy hum of odor preceding them as they move throughout the room. I&#x27;m often reminded of the Axe generation that hasn&#x27;t quite figured out that if I can smell them at ten paces, I&#x27;m certainly not going to be thrilled about it.    But after a female friend mentioned smelling this on an ex and going weak in the knees, I figured, \\&quot;Okay, it can&#x27;t be all THAT bad.\\&quot; Surprsingly, it works exceptionally well with my body scent. My natural notes are slightly musky and acrid, so the floral notes and citrus are an excellent counterpoint to what I smell like naturally, with a base that counters the acridness.     However, this scent does not work for everyone, just like bright purple eyeshadow will not attract a male (the breeding stock of the human population of Long Island to the contrary). It is a great scent,  but like anything else, two short sprays on the neck and chest will be fine for any guy - more than that and you risk auditioning for a Real Life Axe Body Spray commerical - where yes, we can ALL smell how masculine you think you are.</li>
    <li> Nice drydown but too floral for my taste, especially in the opening.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance. One of the longest lasting, strongest projecting fragrances on the market. Smells very similar to sweet oatmeal to me. I highly recomend it if a sweet fragrance is your thing and if you like oatmeal smelling soaps, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
    <li> I love it.smells great.will buy again real soon.shipping was fast..great services...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing bad to report..u cant go wrong wit this.smells so good n last a long time</li>
    <li> I got this based on the reviews and found the price to be reasonable...i am not impressed...it is hard to describe the smell as it has many different notes that are not working together, but rather each one takes over individually for a while before it fades awkwardly and you feel like you&#x27;re wearing a different perfume...it is also overpowering at first...then fades out into something that reminds you of what your grandfather wore...i don&#x27;t know what others found in it, but definitely not for me, and you might want to sample it first before you buy</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my husband about 5 years ago.  It is hands down the most exhilirating cologne I have ever smelled in my 38 years.  I have never noticed another man wearing it so I think it is a little \\&quot;best kept secret\\&quot;.  I can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Excuse me, sir,\\&quot; and I continued, \\&quot;that fragrance is seriously hurting you--what is that?\\&quot;  This was the question I posed to a stranger from the restroom at French Meadows Restaurant in Uptown, on Lyndale Ave, in Minneapolis, MN.  I entered the bathroom. I approached a stall, handled my business. As I finished, he walks out of a larger stall and washes his hands. I do that same--wash my hands, that is. The scent that lagged behind him was hypnotic, plain and simple. It wasn&#x27;t an attraction; rather, it was a \\&quot;that scent would mix well with my body chemistry;\\&quot; something that was instinctive to me--and has been since my Pops taught me how to wear fragrances: it wasn&#x27;t a tutorial, not as much as noticing what he did every morning, or his routine when he was going out. The trails of scents he left behind taught me the proper amounts, the kinds of lotions to look for, the types of smells to pursue, so that you smell like no one else . . . ever, even if they have the same fragrance. After all: no two people will smell the same, given the exact identical fragrance. It&#x27;s the way body chemistry works, right. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as I washed my hands, I contemplated whether or not I would ask him about this fragrance or if that would be an \\&quot;illegal move,\\&quot; being that I am a male. But whatever: the only stupid question might the be one never asked. . .but I suspect that others qualify as well. So, really, I followed his scent right to their table--I did recognized his gear and his kicks were filthy!! His accompanying lady was also not surprised (maybe even impressed) by my boldness to approach him in such a way as to not lose or compromise my serious edge yet retaining enough humility to follow through and obtain the information that I needed to enhance my own swagger. He replied: \\&quot;Thank you. its Versace Dreamer.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I must say about this product: if you are looking for a complex fragrance that will certainly imprint those fortunate enough to come into contact with you, then Dreamer by Versace is one of the top--It&#x27;s my top tight next to Joop (a classic). They do not sell it in stores anymore, or its only located in selected venues. Anyway, I will have this fragrance on my dresser for a long time.ntact with you, then Dreamer by Versace is one of the top--It&#x27;s my top tight next to Joop (a classic). They do not sell it in stores anymore, or its only located in selected venues. Anyway, I will have this fragrance on my dresser for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few colognes that my husband wears that last all evening. I smells divine.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for a friend. My friend absolutely loves this item. The fragrance is lasting and the delivery was on time as specified.</li>
    <li> Well, I don&#x27;t know how to review a perfume except by saying that I like its strong smell.</li>
    <li> Great scent, great price!</li>
    <li> I place my order and in a few days i received it. The price of it was a very good deal.</li>
    <li> Versace never lets me down, this is one of the best fragrances I&#x27;ve ran into. Scent is very soft and refreshing and every time I wore it, I have received tons of compliments. Would recommend this to every guy!</li>
    <li> He love love loves it!  i just took a chance and kept my fingers crossed.  i haven&#x27;t seen such a rave response to a gift to him in a while. he&#x27;s a young adult, fyi.  i would highly recommend this for any guy. i love smelling it on my son.  i think women would respond positively to it.</li>
    <li> Just sprayed the first spray of my second bottle of this stuff and the dry-down is absolutely wonderful. Everything I remember. Its clean, smoky, spicy, and sweet. In that order. But what keeps your nose glued to your wrist is that perfect, very subtle sweet note in there. I guess its the wildflowers. I don&#x27;t know if \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; is the best word to describe The Dreamer, but it&#x27;s definitely attractive. You&#x27;d be hard pressed to find to smoother fragrance at a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> MY BROTHER IS CRAZY OVER THIS SCENT</li>
    <li> Love this product ordered it for my husband and he loves the smell will be reordering this in the future</li>
    <li> he said he loved it he has been wearing it for sometime and it&#x27;s his favorite. why is there a word calculation? I will not do the reviews if it demands I put in a certain amount of words.</li>
    <li> My new favorite cologne! Great smell, warms up wonderfully and it&#x27;s great for daytime or evening wear. This one is going on my all time favorite list.</li>
    <li> Awesome smell guys!! Chics dig it</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells absolutely amazing. I thought it was a woman&#x27;s scent at first, but when it started to dry down the scent started kicking in with a fresh clean smell. I would wear this on any season, and it would act well for everyday use and even for a date. This is completely different from all the colognes I used to wear. This one is my new favorite!</li>
    <li> my husband was given this for Christmas, and didn&#x27;t know what Versace was.  this spray smells really good once it&#x27;s been on a while.  not what I expected, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> This vintage cologne that&#x27;s from &#x27;96 is for sure a classic scent &amp; It is better then a few of today&#x27;s modern age fragrances. Versace the Dreamer indeed fresh &amp; unique</li>
    <li> This is not the real Versace</li>
    <li> This is another one of my favorite scents to wear because it smells like you just got out of the shower. Females always compliment me on this scent when wearing it.</li>
    <li> Awesome my wife loves it!</li>
    <li> The cologne is one of my favorites and it is not so easy to find! It lasts all day long!</li>
    <li> okay perfume but lasts for atleast 5 hours</li>
    <li> I have always liked this cologne since it came out.......and with this price it was even better!</li>
    <li> lovely un-macho fragrance, not at all overpowering, slight vanilla sandalwood with other notes i cant quite describe..., but still for a guy! a sensual guy!! try this if u are a dude that does&#x27;nt want to smell like chrome or curve...or drakkar ...pewww</li>
    <li> Great fragrance. Ladies love it. It evolves during the day and gets better as the day goes on. Its hard to explain it has a soft fragrance yet when you enter a room everyone knows youre there it is powerful but pleasant unlike many other colognes. My all time favorite and I will buy it as long as it&#x27;s around.</li>
    <li> My favorite men&#x27;s cologne, not too strong and definitely not cheap smelling like most men&#x27;s cologne.  Gave it to my husband for Father&#x27;s Day as he has been using this brand for 15 years.  I also bought it on sale, was best price I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> I was impressed w/the timely delivery however, I was most pleased w/the product. I&#x27;m well aware that some companies sell fake cologne especially online. Therefore I conducted my research and at the end of the day I felt extremely confident that Etradeglobal was a very reputable company. I couldn&#x27;t have been more accurate. If I purchase cologne online again it will be from Etradeglobal.</li>
    <li> Just another ok product...smell does not last long.... Nahh wont buy it again....Too much tobacco essence in it..... Dinn like it ...</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift for my nephew. He loved it.</li>
    <li> Very good dry down not best colonge out there but its a very unique smell. If you want to smell different than anybody else this would be it</li>
    <li> This is my signature cologne when i just want to make and leave a impression without suffocating anyone. Goes on light but last all night long.I highly recommend if its on a dinner date,movie date,business meeeting,etc. The price cant be passed up and this should be ammo in every alpha male&#x27;s arsenal,period.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my friend. .. He was very happy about it , since this is no longer sold at Macy&#x27;s. .</li>
    <li> I JUST RECEIVED DREAMER BY VERSACE AND I&#x27;M PLEASED TOO SAY THAT IT IS&lt;br /&gt;WITHOUT A DOUBT MY NEW FAVORITE SCENT. AFTER THE FIRST SPRAY I WAS HOOKED&lt;br /&gt;ON THIS STUFF.NOT ONLY IS IT MASCULINE, BUT IT WEARS VERY WELL AND LONG&lt;br /&gt;LASTING. GUYS IF YOU WANT TOO SMELL CLASSY AND RICH, THIS IS THE ONE.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M SURE THE LADIES WILL LOVE IT. A WORD OF ADVICE, PLEASE ORDER DIRECTLY&lt;br /&gt;FROM AMAZON AS SOME OF THE MERCHANTS ARE PUSHING OFF WATERED DOWN OLD&lt;br /&gt;ANCIENT KNOCK OFF FOR LESS.I WISH AMAZON WILL STOP ALLOWING THIS AND KEEP&lt;br /&gt;ITS REPUTATION IN GOOD STANDING. BUT DREAMER IS A 5 STAR WINNER THAT DESERVES&lt;br /&gt;ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS.!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> good producto,,, buen precio,, rapido envio,,, excellente servicio, empaque adecuado no muy grande y si peque&amp;ntilde;o,&lt;br /&gt;buena comunicacion e informacion del articulo</li>
    <li> Very great find, definitely everything basenotes.com and fragrantica.com said it would be. It starts with a unisex smell, then as it drys, it has a masculine tobacco smell. Very good</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy, is a scam, this frangance is not original, smeel like sour and the scent smells 5 minutes, is a fake!!!</li>
    <li> Only product I&#x27;ve been satisfied with.</li>
    <li> Simply the best, Versace nailed \\&quot;The Dreamer\\&quot; not for everyone that is for sure.  But for those who are dreamers this is the best ever.  It truly captures in a fragrance what a dreamer is all about and beyond that, it inspires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this since it came out in 1996 a dedicated user.</li>
    <li> This is a great gift to give a partner or any man in your life.&lt;br /&gt;My absolute favorite scent for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I *really* wish they still made Dreamer for Women. I don&#x27;t know why they kept making it for men but discontinued it for women, because that scent was equally as wonderful.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s not completely horrible. But it smells like lavender and and old lady :\ Definitely not for me. It is very strong and has good silage.</li>
    <li> Wow! That is the only description I could use in reference to this product. Bought this based squarely on the reviews of others and I must say I AM NOT THE LEAST BIT DISAPPOINTED! The scent of wild flowers and amber is especially fascinating after about 20 minutes in. Ever so often the scent creeps into my nose just to say &amp;#34;I&#x27;m still here and just want to remind you&amp;#34; compliments will not calm down either from others who get a passer by whiff of this classic fragrance. A must have in the colletion of cologne lover. A truly divinely combination that makes it a pleasure to wear.</li>
    <li> It is a strong and very different fragrance. I am not sure if everyone will like it. I do and my gf likes it as well.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne of all time.  The smell is so unique it&#x27;s unlike any other.  Literally last all day.  The top notes come off very strong but after about 30min the smell that stays is incredible.  Its lavendery, tobacco, musk.  Meant for romantic nights and cold weather.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> It smells great.  After all, what do you want in an eau de cologne? Nice bottle would make it a great gift for any man.</li>
    <li> it dont last long like the ones you buy in macys .  has the same smell and the same bottle as the one in macys but it dont last long so im say it mite be a copy</li>
    <li> This is another great fragrance that I have .. Try it I think you will be pleased at the compliments that you will get enjoy.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of versace perfumes and this one is the best of them all. although versace no longer manufactures them, but you  can still get them for a fairly lesser price. this one lasts from 5-15 hours depending on your skin type. is the best romantic fragrance of all time ! you cannot go wrong with this one on a romantic night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;party wear - yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;work - NO</li>
    <li> I loooooooooooooooooove the way my husband smells when he wears this. And, I can still smell it after a long day on him, unlike many women&#x27;s perfumes that seem to lose their smell before I even leave the house in the morning. It&#x27;s dreamy ;)</li>
    <li> Dreamer is a wonderful understated eau de toilette spray for men...Women love the smell.  Not overpowering.Great gift for a guy.</li>
    <li> 1996 release  Night time (all year) or day time during spring  Date night scent  Oriental Floral/Sweet/Powdery  Lasts up to 10 hours  This stuff is beautiful. The key to experiencing this cologne is to put it on 30-45 minutes before you want others to smell it. The intial scent of The Dreamer is overpowered and excessively floral. After a good 30-45 minutes it dries down to what it will be smelling like for the rest of the time. It is soft, fresh, floral and a tad powdery. It makes me picture a dream world in an English garden surrounded by ivy and grasses..plus powder. It&#x27;s all really good. Definitely worth having for yourself and because ladies love it. There are two different boxes so dont be worried if your The Dreamer comes in a dark blue box with a few stars on it. FOr how cheap the 3.4 ounce is on amazon.. its a great buy.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt my favorite perfume of all time so I try to never run out of it so was sceptic about online purchase with this.  I get soo much compliment with this perfume its crazy. Maybe because it&#x27;s an aphrodisiac lol</li>
    <li> Classic men&#x27;s cologne.. Women love it :)</li>
    <li> I hardly wear it, I wouldn&#x27;t say I regret buying it but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Not my least favorite but has an overall desirable smell. Doesn&#x27;t satisfy my particular taste.</li>
    <li> While this scent has been discontinued, it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite so I had to give it a shot.  First let me say, value-wise, this is incredible... I was quoted $40 for a 1.7 at a perfume shop in the mall, so it was more than double the cost of buying through Amazon.  Second, the cologne arrived within a week, in a sealed box and my husband absolutely loves it!  If it&#x27;s a knock off of some sort, he can&#x27;t tell, and he knows this scent.  I wasn&#x27;t super excited about the smell at first impression, but I&#x27;ve grown to love it (quickly, might I add).  It&#x27;s fresh and sexy.  Overall, great purchase!</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great. I will definitely buy some more!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Refined, complex, interesting, and relaxing - those are the words that come to mind when I smell Dreamer.  It opens up with a fresh blast of lavender, and then dries down into a rich tobacco smell.  It is sweet and fresh all at the same time, which is somewhat unusual for a tobacco fragrance.  Also, the sweetness is not too much for summer, so this one works well year-round.  It is not my signature scent because I have several that I enjoy equally, but it is absolutely signature scent worthy.  If you like the smell of tobacco (Pure Havane, Tom Ford&#x27;s Tobacco Vanille, etc.), but want something that is not quite as &amp;#34;loud,&amp;#34; this is the one to get.  You can wear it at the office, on a date, pretty much anytime.  You WILL get compliments on this one.  My favorite Versace scent easily, and they have made several I really enjoy.  GOOD, GOOD stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne because I had it years ago. The aroma of the Dreamer stays on you the entire day and it&#x27;s the same smell from the moment you put it on till the time you take a shower. Bottom line, I recommend this cologne to anyone.</li>
    <li> Yup you heard me. if only the opening was as good as the dry down, I would have gladly given this 5 stars. So I might as well repeat what most people would agree on with me that this scent is simply not for everyone. Happy hunting!</li>
    <li> This is probably Gianni Versace&#x27;s best fragrance.  I&#x27;ve tried others, but I will tell you truthfully, it&#x27;s a gem of a fragrance.  I love it for the sexy aroma that never fades.  It lasts a long time, from morning &#x27;till way into the late hours of the night.  It&#x27;s perfect for going clubbing or to an all night party.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend after a friend introduced me to it. He likes it and (more importantly) I love it. Very pleasant light smell unlike the cheapo axe and stuff that smells like a high school locker room. This cologne has been discontinued so I was so happy to find it on amazon</li>
    <li> The very first time I got this was as a gift way back when I first entered High School in 2001. For the longest time, I didn&#x27;t know the name since I received it in a gift bag without the box. I knew it was Versace but only knew it by the bottle. Well my bottle ran out on me back in 2007 and I tried looking at all the stores in the mall but had no luck finding it. Lucky for me, a few weeks ago I decided to type in Versace for men and I found the Bottle I been looking for all these years and discovered it was called &amp;#34;The Dreamer&amp;#34;. Let me tell you that &amp;#34;The Dreamer&amp;#34; is authentic when ordered through Amazon. I was a little hesitant but at the small perfume shops that did have this in stock, they wanted $70. I decided to order it from Amazon.com and it only cost me about $40 after taxes were added. It arrived yesterday and as soon as I sprayed it on me, all my memories of the scent came back. This is the real Authentic Versace cologne I remember. The smell is so unique it is hard to describe, but kind of reminds me of the pheromone cologne for men but with a sweet scent that gets better and better as each minute goes by. All you need is a few sprays once in the morning and it continues to smell better as each hour passes and I am a smoker and it still smells good after a few cigarettes. They say that &amp;#34;The Dreamer is tobacco based with a hint of lavender or citrus, but the smell is just DEVINE! Ladies always compliment me and want to go nuts over this scent and guys also compliment me, some of them going mad too lol. This is my all time favorite cologne of all time and I will be ordering at least 3-5 more bottles to last me a few decades. This is truly one of a kind.</li>
    <li> This parfum is the most superlative of fragrance that hit the liquid stands today and for decades to come. It has such an amazing aroma it almost makes you want to eat it! It is by far, in my zestfull opinion the odoriferous maximus of profumo! I give this bold Majesty of the monarchy, the (il Duce)! FIVE STARS \\&quot;*****\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought it along with the body gel about a year ago. The EDT lasts for about 5 hours, the gel for up to 3. It&#x27;s the most versatile EDT i have ever had, can EVEN wear it to work (which would be a little too ... but still I could), suitable for all ages (I am 25), doesn&#x27;t stay too close to the body and can stand its ground in the night crowd (unlike XS or Ultraviolet man), so it gets noticed. At the same time it&#x27;s not too bold or anything so it doesn&#x27;t irritate people and is really good from up close (unlike Moschino Friends which I love but is a little too \\&quot;noticeable\\&quot;). I guess some people would say it&#x27;s just OK because there isn&#x27;t any REAL strong notes to blow you away, but honestly, why would you want that? It&#x27;s also complex and ... dreamy, guess the name suits it well. The price is also good compared with some other names.</li>
    <li> This is amazing and love the smell definitely recommend ... for men or women bought this for my son but I wear it as well</li>
    <li> I will continue to wear this fragrance and the ladies seem to love it as well. Versace is a great brand.</li>
    <li> Nice winter fragrance. Not too versatile, but definitely alluring.</li>
    <li> It was a counterfeit, a good one, but still a knock off. You can tell from the face on the glass compared to my old one bought at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The smell just keeps getting better on me ,received in mail by 6 pm ,sprayed I was aware of the heavy smell for the firs 30 minutes ,now I&#x27;m writing this review at 1 am ,7 hours after the spray and this thing smells amazing right now ,for this price this is an amazing cologne .</li>
    <li> I  love this scent because most likely no one else will be wearing it because it&#x27;s a classic and not sold in stores like Macy&#x27;s anymore, which focus more on new and popular fragrences which half the time suck (in the case of new) or are worn to death by d-bags (in the case of popular) I hoep they never stop producing it though because its a hidden gem.</li>
    <li> excellent smell lasts a long time.  just love it</li>
    <li> Pray they aren&#x27;t discontinuing this fragrance. My hub by wears it and it smells amazing on him!</li>
    <li> The cologne smells good. But from all the reviews I was expecting something way out of the ordinary. Women will smell this on you, but it&#x27;s not a legend cologne. If you need a cologne update, I would recommend this, but expect a more feminine cologne.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne! It lasts a long time and is perfect for any occasion. The bottle and box themselves are super elegant and the smell is just amazing once it settles in.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes. It lasts a long time once applied.&lt;br /&gt;I find it to be a good winter cologne or a night time cologne.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a very dense or thick smell to it [if that makes any sense] so i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be as suitable for summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very much like a light musky or powdery vanilla. A reviewer on youtube said, &amp;#34;It smells like a newborn babies ass covered in vanilla syrup&amp;#34; and that, in all honesty, isn&#x27;t particularly far off.&lt;br /&gt;It has a bit of a more romantic or intimate smell to it, so as i said, i see it being a favorite for night.</li>
    <li> This juice I received is amazing! It has a fresh soapy scent with a hint of tobacco in the background. It is blended together so perfectly! It&#x27;s not like all the very synthetic, generic smelling fresh aquatic fragrances that all smell the same, that are flooding department stores these days. Nothing like those. This stuff is great and very unique! Nothing else like it.  Classic.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my very high maintenance :) nephew for Christmas. He LOVES it. It smells amazing and I couldn&#x27;t beat the price. I know that some colognes smell great from the bottle and awful on...this was not one of those!!! Large, heavy bottle that is sure to last a while! You do not have to put but a small amount on to last all day. Very happy with this product and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> good scense, i like it, use frecuentelly, it came on a packege seal, means it is original, enjoy everyday, thanks</li>
    <li> Smells just fantastic.i love Versace dreamer and the shipment was fast too.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it..I might buy one more soon.</li>
    <li> Read how great it was.. So i tried a blind buy.. Just wasn&#x27;t for me.. Little to flowery or powdery.. Not in a bad or offensive way.. I&#x27;m just a sweet, spicy, or aqua kind of guy...</li>
    <li> This colong is another one of my personal colection thanks</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell quite like I had expected/hoped but that&#x27;s what u get for buying online. It smells pretty good tho.kinda like sweet n spicy n smokey</li>
    <li> The Dreamer smells like a very expensive soap. If you like a men&#x27;s cologne that will give you that clean, soapy vibe then you will love this fragrance from Versace. This is a 5 star fragrance. It&#x27;s a floral, soapy scent that a man can wear without smelling feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening of The Dreamer is a bit strong, and I don&#x27;t like it much. Give it time because the opening settles down after about half an hour. After about 1 to 2 hours you&#x27;ll smell like somebody who washes with an expensive soap. The smell lasts several hours. This is the kind of scent that women like much more than men, but that is the whole point isn&#x27;t it? The Dreamer is a compliment getter from the ladies.</li>
    <li> The scent lasts only a few seconds and it is just not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;You are better off with Dolce Gabbana brand.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne for men.  It has the scent of really good pipe tobacco; warm and sensual; not strong or flowery.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband, seeing that this is one of his faves. I has never actually smelled it before and I have to say, it&#x27;s YUMM! Lol</li>
    <li> This product was introduced to me some years back. The women all seem t0o like the fragrance and some even go crazy over it. The Dreamer is an excellent product for the money.</li>
    <li> I get inquiries about this scent every time I wear it. I&#x27;m not good at describing how it smells, though I will tell you it is unique. Mainly a citrus like aroma with the proper amount of manliness.</li>
    <li> This is a great scent.  My initial thought was that it was a little sweet smelling, but it grew on me.  This cologne lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This fragrance will turn me inside out when my husband wears it!  I can never get enough of it. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas, because is one of his all time favorites. It arrived on time and in perfect condition.  He was very happy with the gift.</li>
    <li> This product was fake to me. I went to Macy&#x27;s to see if my bottle matched theirs and they mentioned to me that this cologne has been basically not selling in the stores anymore for a pretty long time so I absolutely think this bottle is fake! Just watch what you buy online so you wont get ripped off!</li>
    <li> Long lasting and strong.</li>
    <li> Guys, this is not a love at first sniff cologne. In fact when I first smelled it, I despised it. However, after about an hour of wearing it, this heavenly scent started creeping up to my nose. The crazy thing is, this amazing dry down lasted till the next day.&lt;br /&gt;The dreamer is subtle enough to wear everyday. I can even imagine a really good soap smelling like this. In spite of its subtlety, the projection is amazing. I would also consider it to be a very sexy scent.&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, this scent is not for everyone. You need to have a certain personality to pull this off. The scent has a certain depth and complexity that may clash with your personality.&lt;br /&gt;If I could only have one cologne, this would be it!</li>
    <li> Great product for good price love it.</li>
    <li> Muy buen perfume, una fragancia unica que puede cautivar a cualquier mujer que le guste un hombre bien oloroso! la recomiendo!</li>
    <li> Give it as a birthday present to my friend.&lt;br /&gt;He likes it.&lt;br /&gt;It is good for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;May purchase again.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is a definite keeper. Love this cologne to no end. I intend to keep replenshing this product when finished..</li>
    <li> Best Cologne out there have been wearing it for 10+ years. Great for daily use or special occasions.</li>
    <li> smells more like a perfume than a mens cologn. But its ok i guess.</li>
    <li> It smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t have longetivity</li>
    <li> excellent NOT LIKE THAT CHEAP DOLLAR STORE KNOCKOFF &amp;#34;MAN:</li>
    <li> How does this scent smell good to y&#x27;all ? Like this smells like some bod spray from Walmart!</li>
    <li> Love this product, very fast shipping as always with a great price.</li>
    <li> This cologne is off the chain. Each and everytime i wear this cologne i get tons of complimen. This is a must have, its reasonable 3,4 oz and has a very unique smell.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Colognes, its great for all seasons so you can wear it whenever. It&#x27;s the type of scent that works well with just about anyone&#x27;s body chemistry. Versace Dreamer is very versatile and blends universaly!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Came exactly like described, took a little bit longer than expected to arrive but smells terrific and I use it almost on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> good good product  and have nice quatilys and i know people will like it. they should try it and see them selves</li>
    <li> love it!!! this was purchased as a present and the recipient  loved it. The price was great as well! definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> Versace the dreamer is my all time favorite. I keep buying and wearing this cologne since 1998.</li>
    <li> Simply put this is the greatest cologne of all time....lasts forever and the smell constantly evolves over time...tobacco musk....delicious stuff....will make the girls melt</li>
    <li> but is a little bit overpowering for me. It would be a great cologne for someone who likes the fragrances of the 70&#x27;s. Overall 4 stars</li>
</ol>
