      <li>Ever since I purchased this product many years ago, I have been hooked.</li>

      <li>/&gt;this is an awesome buy because these packages are actually larger than the once you get from the store.</li>
      <li>I was glad I did.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what all those top ratings are for.</li>
      <li>I detest the orange flavor but love the mint.</li>

      <li>Highly recommend for that very refreshing flavor!</li>
      <li>Aquafresh ECWA is a great toothpaste and I highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>My mouth feels very clean, minty, and refreshed.</li>
      <li>It does do its tingling-the-mouth/gums-thing and does a pretty good job with freshening the breath.  </li>
      <li>This is a good tasting product and does a great job keeping my teeth white and clean.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind that and just want the clean feeling already, then try it!  </li>
      <li>My mouth feels extremely clean after one use and I have fresh breath for a good 8-12 hours.</li>
      <li>If you are concerned about strong abrasiveness from the paste, yes, you have to watch out with this product.  </li>
      <li>A dentist presented me with a list of toothpastes, listing from strong abrasives to softer/gentle on gums and teeth.  </li>
      <li>Gives a good clean feeling without being quite as intense as some toothpastes.</li>
      <li>A fine product for the price.</li>
      <li>Aquafresh Extreme Clean, you are the greatest toothpaste ever invented.</li>
      <li>This product is very good during transport packaging is not very strictly, I received all packaging has been damaged when the hope I can improve</li>
      <li>The description provided is relatively accurate.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Rinses away to leave your teeth and gums feeling smooth and looking whiter</li>
      <li>No commitments, no obligations, and shipping is FREE.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s important because I&#x27;m a smoker</li>
      <li>Your mouth is taken on a foam filled adventure everytime you brush with it.  </li>
      <li>My mouth feels super clean after brushing!</li>
      <li>It is refreshing and minty, leaving my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Makes my mouth and breath feel so fresh!</li>

      <li>It gets rid of my sensitivity and makes my mouth  feel really clean</li>
      <li>Keeps my teeth clean and shiny.</li>
      <li>Leaves my mouth feeling incredibly clean, and lasts throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Makes your teeth feel sqeaky clean</li>
      <li>The best part is that the mint stays for much longer than any other paste I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>We noticed a huge difference right away.  </li>
      <li>But I think they may have re-forumlated the flavoring, because everything I&#x27;ve used since (all the different variations of Extreme Clean) has been more traditional-tasting, very pleasant.    </li>
      <li>Aquafresh&#x27;s EC may be a bit more expensive, but it is an excellent toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I have gone through many many different types of toothpastes over the years</li>
      <li>Nothing else really competes in my eyes: strong, minty and clean.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like any toothpaste, but this toothpaste is my husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
      <li>Well priced and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>I told him I hadn&#x27;t been to a dentist in 8 years, and he was astonished at how clean and healthy my teeth were for not having my teeth professionally cleaned in 8 years.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon, I can get this toothpaste in huge quantities.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s minty, it&#x27;s fresh, it&#x27;s toothpaste.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gives you fresh breath everytime.  Not sure why I am writting a review on toothpaste, but I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> My family has used this toothpaste for years.  It&#x27;s one of those things we were willing to put an extra dollar or two over the basic Colgate or Crest toothpastes.  The feeling you get from this toothpaste is pretty different since it foams so much!  It does do its tingling-the-mouth/gums-thing and does a pretty good job with freshening the breath.  The orange flavor might weird out beginners but it&#x27;ll grow on you.  If you are concerned about strong abrasiveness from the paste, yes, you have to watch out with this product.  A dentist presented me with a list of toothpastes, listing from strong abrasives to softer/gentle on gums and teeth.  This toothpaste was pretty high up there so if you are sensitive, maybe this isn&#x27;t for you.  If you don&#x27;t mind that and just want the clean feeling already, then try it!  I have tried Colgate and Crest for a long time and they just don&#x27;t compare to this Extreme Clean paste.  Remember, this is a pretty foamy paste that tingles in your mouth big time.  Get your senses ready!</li>
    <li> Great taste and after feel.  I only wish they would bring back the old cap.</li>
    <li> It takes too long for delivery (1 month over).&lt;br /&gt;They are may old items because of weak mint,&lt;br /&gt;So after blush teeths, It leave nasty taste in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I don&#x27;t like this purchase ,</li>
    <li> working good item 100%  Thanks ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aquafresh for decades. Recently the store at which I usually shop stopped carrying the regular varieties of Aquafresh and so I picked up some of this &amp;#34;Extreme Clean&amp;#34; with whitening action, even though it cost a bit more. I was glad I did. Although I&#x27;ve always liked Aquafresh, this Extreme Clean variety freshens my breath like no other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried. Like the other varieties of Aquafresh, it has a strong minty flavor, one that is quite enjoyable and lingers long after I&#x27;ve finished brushing my teeth. It makes my mouth and breath smell fresh.</li>
    <li> Put aside the taste, tube \\&quot;squishiness\\&quot;, color, or other aesthetic attributes for a second... as a toothpaste, Extreme Clean is WAY better than other toothpastes on the market!  It foams considerably more than other toothpastes, but the result is that teeth feel extremely clean, fresh, and polished.  We noticed a huge difference right away.  And now, when using other toothpastes, my teeth feel noticiably \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot; afterwards.  It&#x27;s difficult to articulate (how would you describe a premium Starbucks roast to somebody who had only ever drunk Folgers instant coffee?), but just know that we will never switch back to other toothpastes.     With regard to taste... the first couple tubes we got did taste a little odd.  Sort of like when you drink OJ after chewing mint gum.  But I think they may have re-forumlated the flavoring, because everything I&#x27;ve used since (all the different variations of Extreme Clean) has been more traditional-tasting, very pleasant.    My one (minor) gripe is that it can be a little difficult to get the lid off some tubes... seems inconsistent, though.    Even so, I would continue using this toothpaste even if it tasted like cough syrup and required a pick axe to get into.  It works that well!</li>
    <li> Aquafresh Extreme Clean, you are the greatest toothpaste ever invented. My mouth feels dirty without you. I sometimes panic at the idea of you someday being discontinued, so I buy you in bulk. I cannot live without you.</li>
    <li> Aquafresh ECWA is a great toothpaste and I highly recommend.  It works with whitening and keeps mouth feeling fresh for a long time.</li>
    <li> Read title. It&#x27;s the worst I&#x27;ve ever had. It has this burning sensation at the tip of my tongue and it stays there for probably after 20-30 seconds after brushing. You think it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal but when you brush your teeth 3x a day it&#x27;s really noticeable and annoying.</li>
    <li> LOVE this toothpaste and the great way it leaves my mouth feeling!</li>
    <li> Makes my mouth and breath feel so fresh! Can&#x27;t wait to test out the other flavors in the &amp;#34;extreme clean&amp;#34; line.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s actual results to prove this toothpaste works. After not being to the dentist in 8 years, I was concerned about my oral health and at what he would find when he peered inside my mouth. For the past 2 years I have been using nothing but Aquafresh Extreme Clean, which can tell me if this toothpaste is working or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise my dentist told me I take very good care of my teeth, and there was only one very small cavity he needed to fill. I told him I hadn&#x27;t been to a dentist in 8 years, and he was astonished at how clean and healthy my teeth were for not having my teeth professionally cleaned in 8 years. I don&#x27;t use cleaning products, whiteners, or any of that other junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my habits : I brush twice daily (usually), sometimes only once if I forget. I use Listerine \\&quot;Advanced\\&quot; Mouthwash (the orange kind) once or twice daily after I brush my teeth. There is no ADA symbol on this toothpaste, and although I&#x27;m not a dentist I can tell you this stuff works. Paired with the Listerine I have achieved great results from my dentist. The foaming action is nice to feel, some people hate it. The orange flavor tingles in your mouth - which, followed up by the Orange Listerine, makes your mouth feel like a minty orange and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be diligent to brush at least once, if not twice daily, and use a good mouthwash like Listerine or Act afterwards! Other toothpastes I have used and would recommend are Colgate Total and Sensodyne Fresh Mint. I got good check up results!! I&#x27;m happy!!</li>
    <li> Keeps my teeth clean and shiny. Now with that baking soda blast that invigorates your very soul. Seriously, it&#x27;s toothpaste, and decent stuff at that.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste! Nothing else really competes in my eyes: strong, minty and clean. One thing to note - this is not the orange-y flavored variety. The \\&quot;Whitening Action\\&quot; tube is mint. They don&#x27;t make it very clear on their packaging which is which. I detest the orange flavor but love the mint. Six large tubes of this for just over $20 (subscribe and save) is a real bargain compared to getting this at the store. I hope Amazon continues to keep this in stock.</li>
    <li> We like this brand,we will buy again.This is our favorite brand,and we have been recommended by our Dentist.We have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the orange citrus flavored toothpaste, this is not the product you want to buy. Upon shipment, you&#x27;ll be disappointed to find out it&#x27;s the red-white-blue mint flavored toothpaste.</li>
    <li> best toothpaste I have ever used.  It gets rid of my sensitivity and makes my mouth  feel really clean</li>
    <li> This paste does a better job cleaning my teeth than the&lt;br /&gt;other toothpastes out there.  It is overpriced in the stores,&lt;br /&gt;such as CVS etc.  A great deal here..</li>
    <li> A fine product for the price. Arrived fast. Package was neat and easy to open. This customer shops the market. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My favorite tooth paste. I used one of the popular &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; brands, but switch to this a few years ago. The 7 oz. size is not easy to find. I&#x27;ve only bought it at one of the warehouse stores, but lately it hasn&#x27;t been in stock.</li>
    <li> Best tooth paste ever</li>

    <li> Well priced and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Gets your whole mouth extremely cleam.</li>
    <li> For my money this is the best toothpaste in the books. Fresh aquafresh taste with whitening power that leaves your mouth looking and smelling fresh plus your teeth look white with the extra whitening power.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written for any sort of product. I am a freak when it comes to oral hygiene so having a clean mouth is an absolute must for me. I have gone through many many different types of toothpastes over the years but this particular brand of aquafresh (and ONLY the Aquafresh Extreme Clean Deep Action) is hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever used. My mouth feels extremely clean after one use and I have fresh breath for a good 8-12 hours. This toothpaste coupled with a oral b pulsar toothbrush will bring you to toothbrushing nirvana.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste.  Has extra strong mint (in a good way) that leaves your mouth fresh for a long time after brushing.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste hands down. Makes your teeth feel sqeaky clean and it gets really nice and bubbly while brushing. The flavor is a minty/orange which is different but I can&#x27;t go back to regular mint toothpastes.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste due to the freshness it leaves inside the mouth after use.&lt;br /&gt;I got a really great discount deal on this from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. Great, refreshing taste.</li>
    <li> The is one of the best toothpastes by Aquafresh that I have used. The description provided is relatively accurate.  The delivery is this item was professional.</li>
    <li> Ever since I purchased this product many years ago, I have been hooked. This is my favorite toothpaste because you can actually feel it working. I have never had a product that has left my mouth feeling clean longer after brushing than this toothpaste. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Price! Excellent Packaging! Fast Shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> On time.  Intact.  As advertised.  No problems.  A well known retail item of consistent quality. Cleans and whitens as well as any I have tried.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores.  Good product/like the bubbles.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best toothpaste I have ever used. Why? Because it whitens teeth very well, it foams better than most other toothpastes, you can use a pea-sized amount while still getting a full clean, it has a tasty flavor, it wards off bad breath and it just makes the mouth feel great. Aquafresh&#x27;s EC may be a bit more expensive, but it is an excellent toothpaste.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just toothpaste so it&#x27;s not spectacular, but it works well and I will probability buy it again. The taste isn&#x27;t my favorite, I&#x27;m a wintergreen mint guy :P</li>
    <li> Gives a good clean feeling without being quite as intense as some toothpastes. I don&#x27;t particularly like any toothpaste, but this toothpaste is my husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> Ever travel to Mexico or another foreign country? If so, you notice there are a lot of similar brands at their grocery store. Take them back to your hotel and you&#x27;ll find out there is something that&#x27;s just not right. That&#x27;s the feeling I got when using Aquafresh Extreme Clean purchased from Amazon. Same brand, same logo, similar box, not the same experience. With 6 tubes of toothpaste in my hallway closet, Now that I have 6 tubes of toothpaste in my hallway closet, I&#x27;m on the fence about making another purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. It&#x27;s minty, it&#x27;s fresh, it&#x27;s toothpaste. Other whitening toothpastes i&#x27;ve used remove a layer of skin in my mouth, but this one does not do this so i&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  Works good and leaves my mouth feeling refreshed.  That&#x27;s important because I&#x27;m a smoker and I should.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what all those top ratings are for. To me, this is the foulest, most obnoxious-tasting toothpaste I have ever used! Oh, sure, it works...but so does almost any other toothpaste if you use it regularly and correctly. I think one reason this must be effective is that, once you use it, you have to rinse with Listerine just to get rid of the taste. If anyone wants the remainder of the container I bought, you&#x27;re welcome to it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and models of toothpaste and this by far is my favorite. I don&#x27;t ever leave the house without brushing my teeth with this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> almost gone will back for more order , thank you</li>
    <li> wish i&#x27;d have got just one tube, i&#x27;m not a big fan of the taste of this stuff. works great on my teeth however.</li>
    <li> This foaming toothpaste is incredible. Your mouth is taken on a foam filled adventure everytime you brush with it.  You can&#x27;t be price either! Hopefully I won&#x27;t need toothpaste for a year.  Seriously why have you continued to read this review. Buy the toothpaste, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This was nice the first few times, but then the burn it created in my mouth became too painful.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste! Just have to use a tiny bit, and you get a mouth full of foam. Cleans well, especially with my electronics toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also convinced it saves you money. I mean, my wife and I take a LONG time to go through a tube, seeing as how you use such a small amount each time you brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it!</li>
    <li> This is a good tasting product and does a great job keeping my teeth white and clean.  Leaves my mouth fresh.</li>
    <li> ...this is the paste for you!  I am not too picky about many things.  My toothpaste though is an absolute priority.  This is the strongest mint I&#x27;ve ever found, and my mouth definitely feels cleaner after having used it!  The best part is that the mint stays for much longer than any other paste I&#x27;ve used.  Brushing your teeth before bed is a no brainer; being able to kiss your husband once HE&#x27;S ready for bed and still have great breath?  AWESOME.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually fun to brush my teeth with this tooth paste.  Leaves my mouth feeling incredibly clean, and lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> For the past couple years, I noticed I would get this strange white sticky pasty goo in my mouth after brushing. It wouldn&#x27;t form right away, but by the time my work commute was over, it would be there or when I woke up the next morning my mouth would be a sticky yucky mess. It was embarrassing to talk to someone and have sticky weird stuff in my mouth. My mother was visiting and borrowed my paste and even she said she developed the sticky goo, which she hadn&#x27;t had before. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on and instead just got in the habit of wiping my mouth out with a tissue before facing anyone when I got to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After googling, I discovered it&#x27;s some kind of allergic reaction to certain toothpaste ingredients and different ones were named culprits. I tried different toothpastes including arm and hammer, but it still caused the goo. I tried rinsing my mouth out several times after brushing which helped a little, but the goo would still form. I mentioned it to my dentist and she recommended switching to a  sensitive teeth type of paste, which I did, but I still got goo mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept researching and finally tried Aquafresh after one of the reviewers described the same issue and called out an ingredient related to tartar control. Aquafresh apparently doesn&#x27;t use this ingredient. I tried the Aquafresh and I didn&#x27;t get goo mouth afterwards! I don&#x27;t know if toothpaste companies changed what they use for tartar control, because I&#x27;ve used tartar control TP before and I don&#x27;t recall having the goo reaction.Nevertheless, now I know and will just stick with Aquafresh going forward. What a relief!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from solving my allergy issue, it&#x27;s a very refreshing flavor. My mouth feels very clean, minty, and refreshed. Mine wasn&#x27;t orange flavored though like others have said...Maybe they had a different product. Hopefully the lack of tartar control won&#x27;t cause any issues at my dentist check ups...</li>
    <li> This product is very good during transport packaging is not very strictly, I received all packaging has been damaged when the hope I can improve</li>
    <li> i like this toothpaste but i hate going to the store.&lt;br /&gt;this is an awesome buy because these packages are actually larger than the once you get from the store.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Amazon, I can get this toothpaste in huge quantities. I really like it. You will like it as well.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing flavor! Unsure if it will brighten my teeth because I just began using it.  The \\&quot;mint blast\\&quot; is just that. Highly recommend for that very refreshing flavor! ENJOY!!!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste but fear they have stopped making it.  That&#x27;s the only explanation for the fact that it is only available at insane pricing here and elsewhere.  Who do you know, save for the US Government, that will pay $30 for 6 travel sized tubes?  Seriously, I can only assume supply and demand at work where it&#x27;s not being made anymore.</li>
    <li> I switched from Acquafresh to Crest ProHealth as studies are showing that Triclosan (an antibacterial ingredient which is NOT necessary in toothpaste) is an endocrine disrupter.  Play it safe and SWITCH.  Also check out ewg.org for more on safe products for you and your family!  Why risk it--there are great brands without Triclosan which work well.</li>
    <li> whenever i brush my teeth with this toothpaste, i feel my teeth cleaner and cleaner. I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to the whitening aspect of it but I am glad to say that I see my teeth whiter as well. I don&#x27;t care about the taste of it as long as it cleans better and whitens my teeth.</li>
    <li> Tastes great and represents a good value.</li>
    <li> I love the Extreme Clean toothpaste from Aquafresh. It is refreshing and minty, leaving my mouth feeling fresh and clean. I&#x27;ve use some other toothpaste that do not leave that effect after brushing, so this is my go-to.</li>
    <li> Do you like to use Hall&#x27;s cough drops for toothpaste? Well, I don&#x27;t and this is less tasty than Hall&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the \\&quot;after taste\\&quot; won&#x27;t go away. My teeth do feel super clean, but I think that&#x27;s mainly because my tongue is numb. Menthol isn&#x27;t listed in the ingredients, but they must have something similar in there.... It was a bad surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this at Target. It was on clearance, and now I know why.</li>
    <li> I keep on purchasing this product because I find it better than any other tootthpastes.</li>
    <li> Received in the mail without any issues...great toothpaste, freshens breath and whitens teeth. Aquafresh extreme clean leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> Aquafresh extreme clean whitening action, I have been using it for years I will never use any other toothpaste.  Love Aquafresh!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite toothpaste that my family has been using for YEARS. Great taste with plenty of suds. My mouth feels super clean after brushing!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste! You get the clean feel and the microbubbles to have a clean sensation. Cheaper than riteaid as you can buy them in bulk.</li>
    <li> I like Aquafresh and have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> First of all, I did recieve the correct flavor as shown in the picutre. Next, you just bought 6 fairly big tubes of TP for 15$. At Rite Aide, ONE costs around $4.00. Do the math, you will save money in the long run, especially if you have a big family.</li>
