      <li>I spray this on damp hair, blow dry and then finish with a good hair spray.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my hair from frizzing and makes it look so much thicker!!  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this really gives it body and a beachy look.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I guess I was expecting a miracle product based on many of the reviews. My hair is stubborn and finding a product that actually gives it any hold is near impossible. I will say that I love the smell and it does give my hair that salty feel but I&#x27;m not wowed by it. I&#x27;ll keep searching for the certain product but maybe someone who doesn&#x27;t have the world&#x27;s most stubborn hair will have better results.</li>
    <li> This product works really well in keeping my curls springy without making it stiff. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got normal-thickness hair and can get by with a great look just by spraying this in my hair and letting it dry after towel drying showered (but not washed) hair. Great product!</li>
    <li> A have to have in our household</li>
    <li> What the Heck!.....why did I not find this sooner!&lt;br /&gt;Someone should have told me! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KMS Hair Play Sea Salt Spray is perfect for the tousled, beachy hair look!  So easy and smells great!  Leaves your hair with a romantic flare!</li>
    <li> As a guy who surfs on the weekends, I always noticed that my hair would always look awesome after surfing... something about getting in the ocean allowed my hair to be a tad stiffer as far as hold, but still soft to the touch (I have very fine blond hair that never stays put).  I used to joke that I should put ocean water in a spray bottle and sell it to the masses. Apparently someone else had a similar idea.  (except without the fishy smell)  The product gives my hair a very similar style.  It smells fine, and if you use this instead of water to wet your hair, you can shape it while blow drying with better results.  My only ding on the star is the picture shows a professional spray bottle, and what was delivered was a basic spray bottle... just less control.  Either way, good product.  I should have made this and been rich instead of buying it on Amazon, but what can you do?  Guess I am off to go buy a lottery ticket (with good looking hair)</li>
    <li> good product and  i would reorder from seller.</li>
    <li> This works and it&#x27;s not expensive. Not sticky. Does not smell like a chemical.</li>
    <li> I have thin, short, fine hair and have bought every product known to mankind looking for volume.&lt;br /&gt;This is the answer.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this, so I bought one for her birthday.  I admit to trying it a few times (shhh! don&#x27;t let her know) before she remembered to take it with her after a visit.  It works great.  It&#x27;s rare that I can say that about any hair care product, but I like this.  It adds body and gives your hair a wavy/tousled feel.  The best part?  You don&#x27;t have to overwork the styling when you have better things to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is particularly true if you&#x27;re a wash-and-wear type of person.  Give your damp hair a few strategic sprays, scrunch it a bit, then go on your way and forget about it.  It comes out just fine with no fuss.</li>
    <li> Its ok;  i like the bumble &amp; bumble seasalt spray better.  The product arrived on time and in new condition.</li>
    <li> Hair type: fine, thin, oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have only good things to say about this product: first, it smells great, like a product that a professional salon stylist would use on your hair. Second, I&#x27;m very low maintenance, so beauty and hair products have to be really easy for me. This one is literally spray and go, and it looks great with very little effort. I use it with a curling iron and it gives perfect beachy waves in about five minutes. At first I thought the texture was too heavy and stiff, like hairspray, but the trick is to run a brush through your hair really quickly, and then it&#x27;s nice and soft. The overall finish is matte, which sounds weird, but it&#x27;s not greasy or thick, it really does make you look as though you&#x27;ve been at the beach all day. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair and this product really helps me keep the curls together.  I won&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> I can notice a little bit of difference if I use a ton of it, but it is not at all as good as other sea salt sprays that I have used.</li>
    <li> I have pretty fine, mostly straight hair. I bought this product because my hair has some natural wave when air dried. I was hoping that the spray would accentuate that wave. However, it did nothing. I tried air drying and blow drying, it made no difference. If you have thick already wavy hair then the spray might work. If you have fine hair like me I would pass!</li>
    <li> Matte finish, smells okay (kind of lime-yish)...I generally use it to help my hair stay in a certain style, since it tends to slip. Also good for simply spraying into towel-dried hair for some beachy texture, or on oily second-day hair instead of dry shampoo. With dry shampoo, It takes forever to brush out the white powder and ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that. ;) I&#x27;d rather use this spray&#x27;s matte finish to tame the oil shine, and throw my hair in a bun.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair horribly sticky even just with a few sprays</li>
    <li> KMS has changed the look, design, and name of its sea salt spray many times, so I&#x27;m always a little hesitant when I need to buy the newest version.  I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;m still very pleased with this product.  I have very fine hair, so I need a product that will add some density in order for me to style my hair.  For me, this is sort of like a temporary hair thickener.  It works really well, is as good as KMS&#x27; previous versions, and comes from a trusted hair care line.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I love it! This is a really good hair product. Very happy I purchased it and my hair thanks you!</li>
    <li> This hairspray does a fairly good job of giving me volume when I use it on my roots. Sometimes it gives my hair a weird texture, not the &amp;#34;beachy look&amp;#34; but just kind of frizzy. If you use too much by accident the salt shows up in your hair and you have to shampoo to get it out.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.. doesn&#x27;t change the texture of my hair and give it a nice, easy going beach look without hassle. I use a few sprays it before drying my hair. Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Gives my fine, curly hair more texture and fullness. I&#x27;m a wash and go type person, and this product is perfect for me, quick and easy to use. For those mornings when I&#x27;ve washed my hair the night before and my curls are all over the place from sleeping on wet hair, I spray this into my hair in the morning, work it in a little bit and it helps calm the morning frizzies while helping to define the curls and add volume. Love it and will continue to buy! Oh and it smells great too, the scent makes me think of a margarita!</li>
    <li> Works well for me!  Naturally curly hair.  No product feeling.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for YEARS.  Gives great, beachy waves.  NOTE:  My hair texture already has body and curl--this reduces the frizz and softens the curls to waves.  It does have a mattifying effect (reduces shine) on the hair--just like a day at the beach.  So, if you are looking for beachy waves with a lot of shine, this is NOT your product.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product. I have fine hair and this product does nothing for it except leaves it feeling dried out. Ill probably throw it away. :/</li>
    <li> Does create waves  in my hair. I don&#x27;t like the texture that it creates, but I think that&#x27;s just prt of this type of hair product. Makes my hair very dull,</li>
    <li> This is my favorite stuff!  I have a wave to my hair and this product makes it smooth and beautiful.  I love this!  I order 3 at a time and they always come very securely packaged.</li>
    <li> It did not meet my expectations. I have naturally wavy hair and this seemed to intensify the frizz. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it especially if you have a natural curl to your hair.</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this and I really like it for when I don&#x27;t have time to flat iron my hair.  This makes it the perfect level of &#x27;scrunchy&#x27; and holds all day.  doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, as it smells delicious, but it leaves my hair sticky. My hair is naturally wavy, but I will have to keep searching for my perfect waves product.</li>
    <li> Love the sea salt spray. Have found another brand that I prefer but this one is my #2.</li>
    <li> You instantly can tell that it adds texture to your hair making it easier to style,definitely makes a world of a difference</li>
    <li> Like it but didn&#x27;t do what I hoped.  I was hoping it would put more wave in hair</li>
    <li> I wanted a hair product to accentuate my naturally wavy hair. I am very happy with this product. I wet my hair with a spray bottle in the morning, scrunch my hair upside down to remove excess water, spray the KMS HairPlay Sea Salt Spray all over, and voila!  I am ready to go! (I also follow up with a few spritzes of Bumble &amp; Bumble Spray de Mode Hairspray.) My hair dries by the time I get to work. This spray defines the waves and with a shine! It looks natural and casual. I go through a bottle a month. I am probably spraying my hair 10-15 times each time. $12 a month for great hair is a deal!</li>
    <li> Product was delivered withing 5 days of placing the original order (placed on friday received on thursday).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item has strong, but pleasant scent, much less overwhelming than most hair spray products. Has a loose hold capable of delivering the style purposes similar to advertised by holding in loose curls and waves without the sticking effect of stronger hair products like moose, gels or waxes, or more standard hair sprays.</li>
    <li> Meh.. doesnt do much but make your hair dry and sticky</li>
    <li> The KMS sea salt spray gives a great texture to my hair. I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> Hated how it made my hair feel gunky. Don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. I couldn&#x27;t get a comb through my hair, and I only used a small amount. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product but she stopped carrying it because she can no longer find it in large quantities. I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon because it&#x27;s great, allows me to style my hair in a way that feels and looks natural (like I didn&#x27;t use any product), unlike most hair product.</li>
    <li> I like this product, I have really long, naturally curly hair. I wash my hair at night, use my product and let my hair air dry. This sea salt spray gives me the &amp;#34;salty, beachy&amp;#34; feel.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for this.</li>
    <li> Similar to Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Sea spray</li>
    <li> My name is Caleb and I have to say that this product is absolutely amazing. The smell of this product smells very clean and it also does its job and adds texture to your hair. You can apply this to towel dried hair for a tousled effect or you can add this product before blow drying your hair to get texture and fullness. I use this product before blow drying personally because I think it looks a lot better that way for my specific hair. This product is totally worth giving a try and is one of my favorite products in my bathroom. I recommend this product to anyone who wants that &amp;#34;just got out of the ocean&amp;#34; look. It is great for messy hair styles or to just provide more texture. Easily a five star product.</li>
    <li> It does give that beachy look, but it also sorta makes hair feel a bit dirty.  It&#x27;s okay, but I couldn&#x27;t wear it for more than one day in a row.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Hate the smell, taste of hairspray.  Bothers me all day.  This gives me some texture without the toxic smell/feel of hairspray.</li>
    <li> this is the second time I have ordered this salt spray. I have fine hair which has a little wave to it. I can use four sprays a day and either scrunch up my hair to airdry, or I can blowdry.  I like this product very much.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve read a lot of bad reviews on this and scratch my head. If you use it for what it&#x27;s really intended for then it&#x27;s great. I have Asian thick hair so it&#x27;s very hard for me to style my hair in the morning unless I leave some type of hair product on the day before. I spray this on my hair in the morning and dry it (sometimes I have to use quite a bit), it give&#x27;s a dry matte finish which allows me to style my hair and keep it the way it is. Without it, my hair starts to pop up and becomes very hard to style. It also adds volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> If I use this on my hair when it&#x27;s wet, it makes it a bit dry and frizzy. Best for end-of-day pick-ups, though still feels a bit drying.I have fine, curly hair.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair voluminous wise, however, I absolutely love the smell of this spray. I will not be purchasing again, but it didn&#x27;t completely dissatisfy me.</li>
    <li> This spray is great for baby fine hair (not heavy or oily) for a bed head look.&lt;br /&gt;Great for low maintenance days when no time to blow dry or style, perfect for camping!&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely purchase again via Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have mostly straight, fine hair that doesn&#x27;t like to hold curl. I use this spray on towel-dried hair and crunch/twist as it&#x27;s drying (and occasionally throughout the day). I end up with soft, beachy-waves with a little bit of texture. It doesn&#x27;t make it dull or sticky when done this way (unlike some other, more expensive surf spray products I won&#x27;t mention). I haven&#x27;t ever used it on fully dry hair, so I can&#x27;t speak to those effects. It does not smell like grape/peppermint - those are ingredients rather than fragrance. It smells clean and fresh - I actually really like it. I have been using this product for over 2 years and will definitely keep buying it. I do like the old trigger-style nozzle better than the new push nozzle, but I have an old one still so I keep switching it over.</li>
    <li> I like this product for giving my hair loads of volume,&lt;br /&gt;which is usually difficult with my very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; hair type.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t weight it down like most volumizers have.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this really gives it body and a beachy look. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and it&#x27;s one of my all-time favorite haircare products.</li>
    <li> I thought my hair which is thin, and straight would look a little fluffyer or curlier but it didn&#x27;t.  My hair looked like I just towel dried it and then put hair spray on it.  I probably did  somthing wrong but it din&#x27;t look smooth, sliky or shiney.  I am 70 and a just out of the shower look I guess is not for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s certainly not as good as Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Sea Spray.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> really liked this, made my hair look beachy. i&#x27;m out now though so time to buy more :P</li>
    <li> Great product...love the texture it gives my hair and it smells amazing! I&#x27;ve tried a few sea salt / beach fair products but this one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> For what you&#x27;re trying to achieve (dry hair) this product is absolutely incredible. When you get out of the shower/bath, immediately blow dry your hair. Once dry, spray with water and then spray this product (sea salt spray) into/onto your roots and blow dry. It gives your hair an incredible dry and matte look. Fantastic product and I highly recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> This was like water for my hair - does nothing.</li>
    <li> I have tried several sprays and I like this one best to mimic real sea salt.  Some of the sprays are too fine of a mist and never really get the salty feeling, or look.  This is a bit &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; but that is exactly how my hair feels after getting out of the ocean.  I can get my fine straight hair to hold natural waves all day.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve found, especially for those with thin, fine hair. I will definitely continue to order this product (I actually already have ) :-)</li>
    <li> does what it says it is going to do---nice product</li>
    <li> Love this product. Helps my hair wave beautifully! WAY cheaper than a perm.</li>
    <li> I get good results with this spray, and it smells great. A friend visited and (without my knowledge) started using it while he was here. When he was leaving he said &amp;#34;I&#x27;m embarrassed to ask you but where did you buy that hair stuff in your bathroom?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Good product, too bad I went through it so fast..</li>
    <li> This is one of the better brands of sea salt spray for hair.  I have very fine hair and live in Florida, so the heat and humidity does a number on my already thin fine hair.  I spray this on damp hair, blow dry and then finish with a good hair spray.  Keeps my hair from frizzing and makes it look so much thicker!!  Good stuff!!</li>
    <li> I love the texture that this give my hair.......but after two uses my scalp is so dry that I have the worst dandruff that I have ever seen. So if you don&#x27;t mind deep conditioning your scalp on the daily, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my hair. It&#x27;s not sticky or tacky. I can still run my hair thru my hair. I play with my hair A LOT and it feels the same while using this. I have blonde, fine, VERY STRAIGHT hair. I spray a good amount of this in my hair, twist it into a high bun, and when I take it out I have waves. It smells good too.</li>
    <li> Adds good body to stick straight hair. After blow drying my hair with this I actually have some volume! Still stick straight but it&#x27;s so much easier to curl and work with. Shipping was fast. I love amazon.</li>
    <li> LOVE! This sea salt spray is awesome...I am a fan of KMS play products and the volumizing spray gel. I tried another sea salt spray (that actually had better reviews than this KMS sea salt spray), and the results were not near as good as KMS. Will not stray from KMS again!</li>
    <li> Great product, big savings over salon price.</li>
    <li> I have VERY straight, VERY fine hair and spend gobs of money on volumizers and sprays and lotions and potions.  I love this stuff!  I comb my wet hair and spray this one - liberally.  I let it mostly air dry and then just do a final blow dry and my hair looks and feels a hundred times better than when I blow dry it with a big round brush and any other product.  I also like the KMS shampoo and did like the conditioner but that is apparently gone.</li>
    <li> This sea salt spray is perfect for people with thin hair who want to give their hair some volume and a &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; beach feel to it.</li>
    <li> great! too big for carry on, they will take it from you. The one i got is the green bottle version.</li>
    <li> Not terrible per se, since in fact the effects are pretty subtle. I have coarse, thick hair though, and if anything this product just made it poofy and hard to manage.</li>
