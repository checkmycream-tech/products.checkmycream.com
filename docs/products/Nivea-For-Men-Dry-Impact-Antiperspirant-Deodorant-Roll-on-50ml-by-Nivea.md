<li> This 3 pack usually lasts me around 8 weeks.</li>
<li> Seems expensive, but if you have trouble finding a product that will keep the stink and wetness out, you must try this!  </li>
<li> This was a bit expensive, but this was a difficult to find product in the US.  </li>
<li> He is very disappointed.!!!</li>

    <li> I buy these on every trip to Europe.  Love em!  Wish they sold these in the states at the supermarket.</li>
    <li> Arrived super quick, none of the glass was broken, great smelling - and perhaps because I bought six, it arrived factory sealed in plastic with a sticker on it. They stopped selling where I live, for some reason, so I was really glad to figure out I could purchase this from here at an affordable rate. Very very happy and getting compliments on the smell all the time.</li>
    <li> I think I went in my life thru over 50 different types and brands of men deodorants. Some I liked more, some I liked less. But this one is the winner for me. Great fragrance! Awesome Protection for whole 24 hrs!!! No white or yellow mess.&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend it + + !!!</li>
    <li> I discovered the Nivea Roll-on deodorants on a trip in 2009 when I forgot my normal deodorant. I found this at a store and have been using it every since. Compared to the gel deodorants, the Niveo roll-on goes on thin and dries quickly. I never like the white sticks because of the residue from them. This stuff also lasts longer than other deodorants I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I average about a month with each bottle. The only issue is it was hard for me to find initially, but thanks to Amazon, I can get it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and have yet to go back to any of my old brands.</li>

    <li> Due to dry skin and living in a desert, I try not to shower every day. Before I found this product, I had to wash under my arms and put on a new round of deodorant any day that I didn&#x27;t shower the night before.  Not with this stuff. I can always go two days and usually three days before reapplying. It is really that good and has no irritation.</li>
    <li> Husband loves these !</li>
    <li> Overall a good deodorant. Lasts a long time and smells good with no residue. The ladies like this scent :P</li>
    <li> Best thing about this deodorant is that it really works. The scent is fresh and clean without being overpowering and lasts easily all day under harsh conditions.</li>
    <li> Have been using this deodorant for a while now. It&#x27;s lasting, smells great, and most importantly, it doesnt leave stains on clothing</li>
    <li> I learned to appreciate this men&#x27;s deodorant when I was in Europe and so happy I have a way of ordering it here in the States (which, oddly, does not carry it).</li>

Normally it should be called roll-on with \\&quot;Greek Feta Cheese with low fat\\&quot;! He is very disappointed.!!!</li>
    <li> love it, but one came broken!</li>
    <li> Have sensitive skin and have tried many different products.  This stuff is great!  Lasts all day - even with vigorous exercise.  No flakes or white residue - and does not stain clothes at all.  Goes on &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, but drys very quickly - not a strong product smell which is good so it does not compete with colones or aftershaves.  Seems expensive, but if you have trouble finding a product that will keep the stink and wetness out, you must try this!  Container is heavy duty glass with a screw plastic cap - not too large or heavy.  Daily use at home and travels great in my carry-on on business trips!</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. A buddy of mine from Europe turned me on to this stuff. Much more effective than old spice high endurance or mitchum. Prior to using Nivea, I was blowing through dress shirts in 3 months (no undershirt), now they last 6-9 months. Way less sweat and odor. This 3 pack usually lasts me around 8 weeks.</li>
