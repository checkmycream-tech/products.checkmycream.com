      <li>do have very fine hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very lightly scented just as promised…a bit of fruit botanicals and mint.  </li>
      <li>this Fekkai volumizing conditioner works wonders in delivering satisfying, tangible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I was worried that this container could stain my tub/shower (I had done this accidentally with a shave cream many years ago).</li>
      <li>It had a refreshing citrus smell that made me want to use it more just by the smell alone.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love how this conditioner makes my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>Also, I found that the conditioner works even better when combined with the styling whip for smoothness and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product and will use it again.  </li>
      <li>To starts, I am so glad I checked the reviews here for the experience of others.</li>
      <li>, my favorite way to use it is as a leave in.</li>
      <li>But when you rub it between your hands, it feels more like a shaving cream consistency.</li>

      <li>It also smelled pretty darned good.</li>
      <li>every strand in abundant volume with this silicone-free bodifying souffle that conditions fine hair and feels light as air.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The foam is very full and luxurious.</li>
      <li>I press down on the top and the perfect amount comes foaming out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because this is not as moisturizing as other Fekkai conditioners, if you have oilier hair, I’m thinking it could be just perfect for you.</li>
      <li>hair is almost to my waist, and in excellent condition -- so I&#x27;m very careful about what product I trust it to,</li>
      <li>The foam conditioner is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave greasy residue on hair.</li>

      <li>Fekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Conditioner sound like what you may be looking for? :)  </li>
      <li>It makes my fine frizzy hair smooth but fuller.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a HUGE difference in terms of volume, but I would continue using this because I do think it improves the appearance/condition of my hair.</li>
      <li>that during application…shake the can well, then and use a light pressure on the nozzle.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, I read the instructions.</li>
      <li>love the fragrance which smells like fresh grapefruit and citrus.</li>
      <li>this is a sink/shower conditioner that dispenses in a light foam cloud that quickly and easily works its way into your hair.</li>
      <li>My hair looks, feels and smells good, the citrus fragrance is nice, but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference from what I had been using previously.</li>
      <li>Finally, it is easy to distribute and rinsed super clean.</li>
      <li>First off - I love the scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was pretty satisfied with the results of this conditioner, but not to the extent that I would continue it except during the summer, when my outdoor activities tend to stress my hair.</li>
      <li>So I wasn&#x27;t too sure what the point of a foam conditioner was when I first ordered this product, but I wanted to check it out to see what it could do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll come clean here ...</li>
      <li>It rinses cleanly and does add a bit of body to finer hair but is produce cotton-candy volume.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The foaming aerosol device is fun and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It was clean and not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Conditioner rinsed clean leaving no funky residue or tacky</li>
      <li>After shampooing and rinsing hair with clean water, fill palm with a generous amount of Fekkai Full Blown Foam Conditioner and massage into hair, paying special attention to roots and ends.</li>
      <li>Volumizing effects are very effective and can be felt/seen regardless of whether you blow dry or let it air-dry on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really made my hair looking and feeling full and looking so healthy and bouncy.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t see a difference with my regular products and a good blow drying with a curling brush.</li>
      <li>However, you use it in the shower which was surprising, the can does not seem like it would hold up well, such as rust on the bottom on the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>hair feels full and looks full and lightweight.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Experience fullness that seems to defy gravity with Full Blown Volume Lightweight Foam Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Conditioner,</li>
      <li>after using Fekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Conditioner for a week:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Full Blown Volume collection includes Shampoo, Conditioner, Lightweight Foam Conditioner and Styling Whip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really take traveling, but I love it for home.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fekkai’s first ever conditioning foam maintains fullness in fine hair.</li>
      <li>This conditioner also washes out of my hair quickly.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do a super job of detangling though.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the results, much happier than I anticipated.</li>
      <li>This product is marketed to folks with fine hair, and it didn&#x27;t do much for my thick hair (except provide a really wonderful citrus and ginseng scent).</li>
      <li>The price is a little high but would get again if there was a real good sale going.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, naturally frizzy hair, and in the summer humidity it&#x27;s a styling nightmare.</li>
      <li>The dispensing mechanism is nice because it puts quite a large amount in your hand with only a light touch.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is an additional boost to have the conditioner and mousse in one application and worth its cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did not like this conditioner all.  It made my hair very dry, staticky and fly-away.  I tried using a variety of different shampoo and conditioner combos with this product to try to improve the end results...all to no avail.  Maybe if you live in a really humid environment it won&#x27;t be much of an issue. However, in Wisconsin I fight static electricity and fly always at least 6 months out of the year and definitely don&#x27;t want a product that exacerbates the problem!</li>
    <li> As I grow older, my formerly thick hair has grown somewhat thinner.  This wonderful product gave me fuller hair and kept my hair nice for two full days.  Even the third day was not bad.  I love this product and will use it again.  Plus, the scent is fresh and citrus-y.  Definitely 5 star!</li>
    <li> The first conditioner that does what it says. It makes my fine frizzy hair smooth but fuller. It Also detangles.</li>
    <li> I really like how this foam conditioner added volume to my somewhat flat hair. Not too much but enough to make it look like I had more hair (yay). It also smelled pretty darned good. My honey gave me compliments.</li>
    <li> To starts, I am so glad I checked the reviews here for the experience of others. Like a lot of others, I put this in my hair and left it, like one would do with a leave in product. And that was actually okay for my hair, since it&#x27;s not that I have fine hair, but that I&#x27;ve cut it from being long and thick, to a shorter and thick hair style. A style that needs a lot of body and not be weighed down by heavy products, or else I don&#x27;t get the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not how this product is designed to work. It&#x27;s supposed to be washed out in the shower. This works very well for making hair soft but light and fluffy. And it really worked well for my teen daughter, who has very fine thin hair. Normally she can&#x27;t use any conditioner in her hair. She&#x27;s at an age where her hair is getting very oily every single day, and already having very fine thin hair, the two are a bad combination. So she has to use clarifying shampoo every day, and no conditioner, just to keep her hair nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner however is so light and washes away well in the shower, that she can use it to help soften her hair without completely weighing it down and adding to her oily hair issues. It also has a very nice citrus cent to it. This is so nice I may just keep buying this for her, as it&#x27;s definitely made for her hair type more than my own.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this conditioner. The foaming aerosol device is fun and easy to use. I have to use conditioner daily since I have very silky, straight hair that tangles really bad. My biggest issues with conditioner is that I use WAY too much. I don&#x27;t really mean to, it just comes flying out of the bottle into my hand. I waste a lot of it. That doesn&#x27;t happen with this aerosol foam formula. I press down on the top and the perfect amount comes foaming out. Awesome. This conditioner also washes out of my hair quickly. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and thick like some other conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner itself smells amazing. It leaves a nice citrus aroma in your hair. Unfortunately, the scent does not last all day. After about an hour or so, I can no longer smell it. It does leave my hair feeling amazing. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge volume improvement, but my hair is pretty thick to begin with. It did help with my frizz and my tangles. After using this conditioner, the brush runs through my hair very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this conditioner is not perfect, but I love it. I would definitely buy more of this conditioner.</li>
    <li> Fekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Conditioner is unlike any conditioner I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s a thick foam that can be easily worked through your hair. Leave in for a few moments then rinse out. It did wonders for my thin hair giving it more body and a bit more volume. Anything that keeps my hair from looking limp and almost plastered to my head is a real winner for me. This product went beyond the basic fullness I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I give this product two thumbs up for improving the look of my fine, limp, sorry hair! I look and the mirror and ask, &amp;#34;Who&#x27;s sorry now? Not my hair!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I thought this might be a leave in conditioner by the looks of the bottle. However, you use it in the shower which was surprising, the can does not seem like it would hold up well, such as rust on the bottom on the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for a few weeks and can’t say I like it. After you shampoo your hair, you use the foam, like it is a mousse, and place it on your hair for a few minutes and rinse it. First time I used it the foam came out too fast and I had too much. I could not smell any scent to it. When I combed my hair which is long and curly, it was very tangled. It does not condition well at all. I have a spiral perm in my hair and at the roots is my naturally straight hair. After drying my hair, it was flat at the roots but it was soft. I was thinking it all of my hair was straight; it would be flat but soft. I am surprised to read it is supposed to give your hair volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several times using it I still can’t smell any scent to it. It still does not conditioner my hair well either. I thought if I used it off and on for a few weeks I might change my mind about it but I can’t stay I like this at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll come clean here ... I totally thought this was a leave-in. I had never heard of a \\&quot;mousse-style\\&quot; rinse-out conditioner. Luckily, I read the back before even hopping into the shower.  Now, I think the scent may be polarizing. For me, it translated as \\&quot;pleasant\\&quot; and \\&quot;clean\\&quot; (I thought it smelled like a blend of citrus and mint, which I found to be a very refreshing fragrance). I think because I gravitate towards the uncommon, this registered as very likeable. Now, I definitely used WAY too much the first time. (I think I just enjoyed the texture and the experience. LOL!) So, just be careful of that. Finally, it is easy to distribute and rinsed super clean. My only concern is any potential rust from the canister. I usually leave my shampoo and conditioner in the shower area ... but I was worried that this container could stain my tub/shower (I had done this accidentally with a shave cream many years ago). So, I find myself taking this into the shower and carrying it out of the shower ... and occasionally forgetting it, wrapping a towel around me and going to grab it. I guess, I&#x27;m flummoxed by metal containers in the shower.    Understand, the conditioning aspect is very light (so as to allow for volume and movement), so if you have damaged hair, this may not be the best choice. However, it certainly does leave plenty of bounce. By all means, it does what it claims!</li>
    <li> My hair has thinned since having my daughter but it&#x27;s pretty long. This stuff didn&#x27;t work like I expected. I currently don&#x27;t use these products but the lack of volume as I expected, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. My hair feels nice but I don&#x27;t see a difference with my regular products and a good blow drying with a curling brush.</li>
    <li> I like this mouse conditioner a lot - but it isn&#x27;t great with my curly hair.  It does add volume, which I like, but it seems to very slightly dry my hair more, which makes it seem more frizzy than curly, and I really need less frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE - THIS IS A WASH-OUT CONDITIONER.  You are supposed to put it in your hair, leave it 2-3 minutes, then rinse it out, not leave it in.  I decided to test what would happen if i left it in, and at least for me, it ended up making my hair more greasy and gave it a funny almost sticky feeling by the end of the day.... so, WASH IT OUT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually really like the scent, it is light and reminds me of grapefruit - so big plus for me.  Once it is rinsed out, I don&#x27;t notice the scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to let my Mom give this a try - she has thin hair, and would love some more body in her hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair, so i really like this foam conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair like a traditional thicker cream conditioner. To start, the directions say use a palm size amount. I found that weird at first because I&#x27;m used to using as coin sized amount. When you press the top down, the foam comes out quickly. You end up with a palm size amount before you know it.  it looks quite similar to a mousse. But when you rub it between your hands, it feels more like a shaving cream consistency. it goes onto your hair easily and rinses out completely. It has a very pleasant citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this conditioner for any one with fine thin hair. I&#x27;m not sure how this conditioner would work with thick hair.  It may be too light or simply require you to use a lot more of the product.</li>
    <li> This looks like mousse, but it&#x27;s not.  I made the mistake of putting it on my hair after I got out of the shower only to read the directions and having to rinse this stuff out of my hair.  It&#x27;s conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what a conditioner is advertised to do (this one is for volume), I want it to detangle my hair.  Fekkai doesn&#x27;t quite cut it.  Whereas I could simply use a wet brush after using my other conditioner, with Fekkai, I also need to use my detangling comb.  There are tangles everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it has a pleasant scent -- supposed to be citrus and ginseng.  It&#x27;s not sweet citrus, it&#x27;s more like the bitter peel -- a bit strong, but not too shabby.</li>
    <li> When reviewing hair care products the first thing even before I try them is to smell them. Some of them have horrible scents but that was not the case with this product.  It had a refreshing citrus smell that made me want to use it more just by the smell alone. My wife and I use usually the same conditioner and shampoos and we both liked this very much. It was the perfect blalance of style and bounce-her words not mine. The price is a little high but would get again if there was a real good sale going.</li>
    <li> When a person has thin fine hair you are always balancing conditioning with weighing down hair into a limp mess that looks terrible. The fact that this is in an aerosol foam helps really spread the product to where you want it on your head without getting too much on your ends or roots. I really like the fact that my hair shines even after styling using a flat iron or curling iron. So many products do the job but dull hair. With white hair like I have, I cannot afford a clump effect or my scalp shows. I had always wondered about Fekkai products and I love this one!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for loft without sacrificing lightness, this foaming conditioner performs reasonably well. The way it is packaged definitely makes it easier to work with than traditional liquid conditioners. It goes on smoothly and rinses cleanly, but you may find that the application procedure is a bit involved to be part of your daily routine, especially during colder months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why. You shampoo as usual, but then must towel-dry your hair before applying the foam, then wait several minutes before rinsing. It&#x27;s not the wait that&#x27;s at issue, but the towel-drying step. My workaround is to towel-dry with a hand towel, and then pop on a disposable shower cap to hold in the warmth/block out the cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty satisfied with the results of this conditioner, but not to the extent that I would continue it except during the summer, when my outdoor activities tend to stress my hair. As is usual with foaming products, the container does not last long, so you&#x27;ll need to factor that into the value equation when deciding whether to purchase this. As such, I rate it 3.5-4 stars, and am rounding upward.</li>
    <li> First off - I love the scent. A hint of flower and mint makes a great combination that doesn&#x27;t overpower and is gone by the time I leave the door in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have very fine hair and this works great. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for thick hair - you&#x27;d have to use far too much of it. But for thin hair that gets limp fast if the product has too much wax/silicates, this gives volume without weighing down hair.  I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of styling products afterwards that always seem to make my thin hair stiffen and flatten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small ball rapidly expands as you put it in your hair, so a little goes a lot way.  I use this on days when I need a bit of extra conditioning - for meetings and such.  It is more expensive than store bought conditions but on par with salon varieties.  And I do trust the Fekkai name.</li>
    <li> Fekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Conditioner, 6.6 ounce&lt;br /&gt;Category: Hair Care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience fullness that seems to defy gravity with Full Blown Volume Lightweight Foam Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai’s first ever conditioning foam maintains fullness in fine hair. Fine and limp hair maintains its volume. Infused with citrus extract and ginseng. Scented by mint and fruits. The Full Blown Volume collection includes Shampoo, Conditioner, Lightweight Foam Conditioner and Styling Whip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•Infused with Citrus extract and Ginseng.&lt;br /&gt;•Scented by mint and fruits.&lt;br /&gt;•Fulfill every strand in abundant volume with this silicone-free bodifying souffle that conditions fine hair and feels light as air.&lt;br /&gt;•Tip from the Fekkai Salon: Great option for ultra-fine or thin looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;•Fine, limp hair is invigorated to maintain volume.&lt;br /&gt;•Used at the legendary Fekkai Salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes after using Fekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Conditioner for a week:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is almost to my waist, and in excellent condition -- so I&#x27;m very careful about what product I trust it to, if ya know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful experience, and a first at using a &amp;#34;foam conditioner&amp;#34;! After shampooing and rinsing hair with clean water, fill palm with a generous amount of Fekkai Full Blown Foam Conditioner and massage into hair, paying special attention to roots and ends. The foam conditioner is surprisingly light weight, silky and very thick. At once, one notices a perfect combination of invigorating scents -- mint and citrus. After a couple of minutes, rinse conditioner out with clean water and style as usual. Conditioner rinsed clean leaving no funky residue or tacky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After drying hair with blow dryer -- absolutely silky smooth, soft, no oiliness, no dry flyaways. Not very shiny, though, but that&#x27;s okay, as I usually use a tiny amount of Fekkai&#x27;s Brilliant Glossing Creme for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect! Compliments from all I run into during the day and night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*smiles, sips espresso*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does Fekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Conditioner sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2014ments from all I run into during the day and night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*smiles, sips espresso*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does Fekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Conditioner sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2014</li>
    <li> This product is dispensed from an aerosol can. On the face of it I thought it was a mousse product. Fortunately, I read the instructions. While the product didn&#x27;t indicate that the can needed to be shaken, I shook it and then dispensed a small amount in the palm of my hand and worked it through my towel dried hair. I left it on for 3 minutes and then rinsed thoroughly. I lightly towel dried my hair again and blow dried my hair with a rounded hair brush starting at the roots. My hair looked as though it had more volume, but I subsequently repeated the process this morning and applied my regular mousse before styling. My hair looked better despite the initial benefits of just this conditioner alone.</li>
    <li> This Fekkai Foam Conditioner is unusual for a foam in that the directions say to apply to wet hair after washing, wait 2 - 3 minutes and then rinse out. Normally foam conditioners are left in the hair and then dried and styled as usual. In fact, that&#x27;s what I did the first time. It worked pretty well but left just a slight bit of heaviness to my fine hair.  Then I read the directions which I should have done before using it. The next couple times I used it as instructed and I liked the results better. It seemed to add a little volume and body to my fine hair. It didn&#x27;t do a super job of detangling though. The foam is very full and luxurious. The dispensing mechanism is nice because it puts quite a large amount in your hand with only a light touch. It makes it very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance which smells like fresh grapefruit and citrus. It&#x27;s very natural scent, not like something cooked up in a lab. It&#x27;s one of my favorite things about the product. After drying my hair the fragrance went away so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it conflicting with my cologne.</li>
    <li> This is a very light foam that is a little on the runny side. This is a rinse out conditioner. I followed the directions and rinsed it out after 3 minutes in towel dried hair. It was clean and not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dried clean and smooth. I definitely was not weighed down. The smell is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, my favorite way to use it is as a leave in. I just use a really small amount and put it through my fried dry ends. It works great. It keeps my hair from getting dry and yucky in the wind. Play around with it and see how it works best for you.</li>
    <li> So I wasn&#x27;t too sure what the point of a foam conditioner was when I first ordered this product, but I wanted to check it out to see what it could do. This product is marketed to folks with fine hair, and it didn&#x27;t do much for my thick hair (except provide a really wonderful citrus and ginseng scent). It wasn&#x27;t bad, but I missed the thickness of a regular conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But where this product is exceedingly wonderful is with my daughter&#x27;s very long hair. She&#x27;s 8, and I wouldn&#x27;t call her hair fine, exactly, but it&#x27;s  hair that has never been chemically treated or seen any heating element warmer than the low setting on a hair dryer (and that maybe 4 or 5 times a year). So her hair is soft. She has a tendency to go a little overboard with the conditioner and then, for whatever reason makes my kids afraid of the water, doesn&#x27;t want to stick her head directly under the shower spray. There have been many times when she&#x27;s had to get back into the shower again after drying off because she hasn&#x27;t rinsed out all of the conditioner in her hair (and as long and curly as her hair is, she can&#x27;t go without).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foam conditioner is great because it dispenses like a mousse styling product. Just a little push on the dispenser will fill your palm with a rich, thick foam that can easily be spread throughout the hair. And, because it is lighter in texture than traditional conditioner, it rinses out much more quickly. This is good for my daughter&#x27;s hair as well as for our water bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure that this is a product we&#x27;ll buy often, but especially when it&#x27;s hot out and she&#x27;s using a pool with chlorine, this is a great product to keep her hair healthy.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a foam conditioner before, but I&#x27;m quite fond of this one. It&#x27;s easy to use. Simply dispense in your hand and apply to damp hair. It foams up quite a bit, so a small pump goes a long way. Work through your hair and then wait 2-3 minutes. Rinse the conditioner out, and you&#x27;re done. I absolutely love the fragrance. It has a nice citrusy-mint smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it does a great job of conditioning my hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed a HUGE difference in terms of volume, but I would continue using this because I do think it improves the appearance/condition of my hair.</li>
    <li> On my particular head of hair (short/medium length that leans on the fine side) this Fekkai volumizing conditioner works wonders in delivering satisfying, tangible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product looks and acts like styling mousse this is a sink/shower conditioner that dispenses in a light foam cloud that quickly and easily works its way into your hair. It has a very refreshing citrus and ginseng fragrance that subtly lingers on for several hours. Volumizing effects are very effective and can be felt/seen regardless of whether you blow dry or let it air-dry on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very nice product especially for those days when a little extra lift is appreciated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the Fekkai shampoos and conditioners at one point in time and of the lot, this is my least favorite. Does it make your hair fuller? Yes, actually it does and you can see the results from nearly the first shampoo. Initially I was impressed until I realized that fullness came at the price of drier hair. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with drier hair save for in winter when it could use an occasional moisture boost treatment but this shampoo and conditioner made my hair much drier and less shiny than I would like, even in the summertime when I never have dry hair problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is not as moisturizing as other Fekkai conditioners, if you have oilier hair, I’m thinking it could be just perfect for you. You could get some volume but don’t have to worry about a conditioner weighing your hair down. If you hair is already dry then you probably want to avoid it like the plague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the aerosol was an interesting delivery method. It comes out like a mousse hair product and has way more moisturizing ingredients than I thought it would, just not enough. I would save it for occasional use if it weren&#x27;t for one thing . . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have to mention this but the smell . . . the smell is . . . not . . . good. Imagine melon, with mint, with citrus. Doesn&#x27;t sound so bad on it&#x27;s own, does it? Now add crushed SweetTarts. Yeah, now imagine rinsing your hair, leaving no moisturizing agents behind, but the smell of sickly artificial sweetness following you all day long. It&#x27;s not the worst smell in the world but it&#x27;s definitely not one I want wafting after me. I mentioned it to a friend and she told me she&#x27;d already noticed and didn&#x27;t want to hurt my feelings. Yeah, so it&#x27;s not just me. Maybe you&#x27;ll love it though. Always a possibility. Different scents for different noses. :)</li>
    <li> I have very fine, naturally frizzy hair, and in the summer humidity it&#x27;s a styling nightmare. So I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a conditioner that will give me fullness and control. The Fekkai Aerosol Foam Conditioner worked well to control the frizz. My hair looks, feels and smells good, the citrus fragrance is nice, but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference from what I had been using previously. Also, I found that the conditioner works even better when combined with the styling whip for smoothness and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I liked the product and the results, the implementation was a little awkward. Shaking a can and pumping out foam like shaving creme made it more difficult to use. And the foam melted in quickly, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I had used enough. I do like it enough to continue using it, but I would rather have my conditioner in a bottle.</li>
    <li> This Fekkai conditioning mousse impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very lightly scented just as promised…a bit of fruit botanicals and mint.  Fragrance is not noticeable after hair is dried and styled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used it with varying shampoos, one of which was a Fekkai and it worked well with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it with additional styling products and without (just the conditioning mousse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it with a large Spornette brush and a smaller Conair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked well no matter the alternatives I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels full and looks full and lightweight.  It holds that fullness without any heaviness throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arising the next morning, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my hair still looked full and light with just a tiny bit of finger fluffing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an additional boost to have the conditioner and mousse in one application and worth its cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that during application…shake the can well, then and use a light pressure on the nozzle.  A dollop seems to grow in size as you finger it through your washed hair.  Adjust to your own hair thickness and desired performance.</li>
    <li> This thick foam conditioner has a complex scent dominated by citrus and mint.  It rinses cleanly and does add a bit of body to finer hair but is produce cotton-candy volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend starting out with a smaller amount than would seem necessary for the best results.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by this conditioner.  I went into trying it with very low expectations.  The mousse texture seemed like a gimmick, and I suspected it would not be very conditioning at all.  In reality, this conditioner left my hair soft and bouncy.  It comes in a pressured canister, like a mousse, and foams out and expands.  Don&#x27;t go wild dispensing it, as it really does expand quite significantly.  It felt moisturizing when I put it on my hair in the shower, and not at all sticky (I had been afraid it would be sticky).  The smell is amazing- I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s scented with essential oils.  It smells of citrus and mint.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the results, much happier than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> Amazing hair product.  My husband stole this from me and he loves it. Not a crispy feel nor a heavy oily feel.  Gives a lift and holds in place.  This will be a reorder.</li>
    <li> It does what it claims, conditions without weighing my hair down. I can&#x27;t really take traveling, but I love it for home.</li>
    <li> The foam conditioner is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave greasy residue on hair. There was no problem in rinsing it off.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like the smell, it bothers me. It&#x27;s very chemical.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying a Fekkai product.  I love how this conditioner makes my hair feel.  And the smell is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this a bit differently than the directions state.  This is a conditioner we&#x27;re supposed to put on our wet hair, leave in for a few minutes and then rinse out.  But, I&#x27;ve been using this as a leave in conditioner and it&#x27;s really made my hair looking and feeling full and looking so healthy and bouncy.  I love this conditioner!</li>
