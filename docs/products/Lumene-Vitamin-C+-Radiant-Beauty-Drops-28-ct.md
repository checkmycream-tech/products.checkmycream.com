      <li>Work very well!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and love the way it makes my skin feel but will be using real Vitamin C going forward as I&#x27;m interested in treating fine lines/wrinkles, etc....rather than the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>I really like the entire Lumene line, but these capsules are among my favorite items.</li>
      <li>Paid too much on these at Ulta first.  </li>

      <li>They really worked wonders on my skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>

      <li>I love it so much I have shared with a few coworkers so they can try it as well</li>
      <li>Love this radiance in a little tube.</li>
      <li>Just started using it, I really like it so far.</li>
      <li>it is now January 2012, so you all would know that I am new to this line.</li>
      <li>, I guess my skin adjusted to the new products, so bear that</li>
      <li>I decided to give this product a try after reading about it in New Beauty magazine.</li>
      <li>Now I usually do not like reading these reviews since I think the majority of them are written by the company that sells these products</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product three times since the original purchase and use it as part of my nightly skin care regiment, but this product I use every other night.</li>
      <li>They are on the expensive side for me, so I don&#x27;t use them year round, but I&#x27;m sure that if I did my skin would love it!  </li>
      <li>As a red head, fair skinned individual I was sure i would get a bad report from the dermatologist butt</li>

      <li>I travel a lot and the Vitamin C capsules are easy to transport and help keep my skin looking vibrant, instead of dull from air travel or long road trips.  </li>
      <li>; I give full credit to these little drops.!</li>
      <li>After coming off this rough winter in PA I am ready to have a radiant complexion from here on.</li>
      <li>The Body Shop offers the same product in a pump style.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s really doing except making me itch.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Each little capsule is enough to cover the entire face; it smoothes the pores so make up goes on flawlessly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d purchased this as gift for my sister in law who asked for it specifically so I only have that to go by.</li>
    <li> I just started using Lumene products a few months ago and I am SO impressed with the results.  These capsules give my skin an unbelieveable glow.  I have always been prone to breakouts and none of the Lumene products are a problem in this area.  I will continue to be a loyal customer! :)</li>
    <li> I started using this product in December 2011 it is now January 2012, so you all would know that I am new to this line. I use these capsules (night and day) along with the Lumene Vitamin C Bright Skin Radiance Nectar (night and Day) and Lumene Vitamin C+ Day Cream with SPF (night and day). So far I have seen a satisfactory change in my skin tone. My skin looks healthier in terms of the glowing and the marks that I have are diminishing (slowly) but I can&#x27;t expect a miracle in just a few weeks so I am ok with the slow fading process. I imagine if I remain consistent with the regimen than I will be able to see a more significant overall change in my skin. Now I usually do not like reading these reviews since I think the majority of them are written by the company that sells these products but I just had to write of my experience with this product line. Also let me interject here that the 1st few days I started using these products I noticed that I developed a slight acne outbreak. However they did eventually disappear after the few weeks, I guess my skin adjusted to the new products, so bear that in mind for a few of you. Other than that I will continue to use these products.</li>
    <li> Great Sun protection. You&#x27;ll notice a difference in a week or so. Goes on under my moisturizer and helps even out my skin and brightens up my face.</li>
    <li> Feels silky....not much product in each capsule.  Feel as though I could use two each time I apply.  I have dry skin anyway but will not get these again.</li>
    <li> Packaging, delivery Price were good.  The drops make my skin feel incredibly smooth after applying .  I can not discern a long  term result when using the drops.</li>
    <li> Great product, lightens wrinkles</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t absorb very well... My skin started too look orange after a week...</li>
    <li> I use one of these capsules every other night and my skin is dramatically different.  I travel a lot and the Vitamin C capsules are easy to transport and help keep my skin looking vibrant, instead of dull from air travel or long road trips.  The capsules are small, but there is enough to completely use and cover the face and neck area entirely.  I have purchased this product three times since the original purchase and use it as part of my nightly skin care regiment, but this product I use every other night.</li>
    <li> Make my skin soft and bright and healthy .. i like it .. also not oily .. u can but it any time .. i think i will bay it again</li>
    <li> I love these Vitamin C tablets.  They really worked wonders on my skin.</li>
    <li> Just started using it, I really like it so far. I thought it&#x27;s oil in the little capsules, similar to Elemis skin bliss recovery capsules but it is a cream. I like it, its work fine for me so far. I&#x27;ve been putting it on in the evening after cleansing and toning, followed by my night cream.</li>
    <li> It has only been 3 applications of use and I can tell you I am a fan of this product.  I read about it on Woman&#x27;s World magazine and decided to order it.  Well, I guess I am going to be a frequent user now.  After coming off this rough winter in PA I am ready to have a radiant complexion from here on.</li>
    <li> Very unique capsules.  one drop covers your entire face and neck area. Leaves skin silky smooth and nice fragrance from the cloudberries.</li>
    <li> This might be the best face product I have purchases in a while.  I use a product that I am obsessed with for retinol that does dry my skin out so I was looking for a perfect Vitamin C capsule to hydrate my skin.  This is so soft it feels like silk going on.  I love it so much I have shared with a few coworkers so they can try it as well and they felt the same.  It also smells great! This is definetly a product I would recommend to others - so much so that I purchased one for my mom and one for my friend that lives in Portland!</li>
    <li> The product was opened and/or used; some capsules were missing - returned. No really sure what else to say about this.</li>
    <li> Try this and you&#x27;ll be a believer. It makes the skin instantly smoother. I decided to give this product a try after reading about it in New Beauty magazine. glad I did. It&#x27;s a splurge but I love the way my skin feels after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> I do not like these. They don&#x27;t feel like they absorb into the skin, they just feel like I&#x27;m putting a layer of silicone on my face. It just felt artificial and unhealthy. The little capsules are wasteful and pointless. I ended up using these up on my hair before blowdrying it, which looked pretty ok. I would not recommend this product to anyone and I&#x27;m glad I was given it for free and used it up quickly.</li>
    <li> I really like the entire Lumene line, but these capsules are among my favorite items. I use one a night for a month, and they make my skin SO smooth and soft. They are on the expensive side for me, so I don&#x27;t use them year round, but I&#x27;m sure that if I did my skin would love it!  I recommend these capsules if you&#x27;re looking to even out your skin tone and feel soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> My skin feels so soft after I apply it. I will order it again</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day and have seen a pretty dramatic improvement in my skin texture. It literally feels like silk when you put it on. I dab a little on each section of my face and also my neck. I&#x27;m 38 and my skin has a nice healthy glow and is a great base before moisturizer. I&#x27;ve noticed my foundation goes on more smoothly and the individual capsules are great for those who travel. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> First of all I have really sensitive skin and I somewhat like the product because when I put it on my skin has a nice matte finish, however; this product makes my skin itch and once I scratch it stings.  I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because my skin doesn&#x27;t like a lot of stuff except for the other products I reviewed.  I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s really doing except making me itch.  Now since I&#x27;m a product junky I did want to atleast try it, everyone&#x27;s skin is different and since I like the Lumene Nectar I could atleast give this a try.  I changed how often I put this on at night, I use this about every other night or maybe 2-3 times a week.  I&#x27;m almost out so I&#x27;ll be trying something else, but I&#x27;ll keep with the Lumene Nectar that stuff is great.  So bascially I gave it 3 stars because my face has a mind of it&#x27;s own and starts to get an attitude so it might just be me.</li>
    <li> Love this radiance in a little tube.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed to find out that this product is not truly Vitamin C, but rather Ascorbic Acid. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and love the way it makes my skin feel but will be using real Vitamin C going forward as I&#x27;m interested in treating fine lines/wrinkles, etc....rather than the way it makes my skin feel. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my face so smooth! I use it sometimes in place of powder and it gives my face a matte and smoothed over look.  It lasts longer than powder too.  Everytime I use this on my face my boyfriend tells me how pretty I am.  Other than that I am not really sure if I am getting any other benefits because I use so many other creams on my face before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;Oh ya did I forget to mention this stuff smells awesome?!  It&#x27;s got this light airy citrusy scent that I adore.</li>
    <li> Paid too much on these at Ulta first.  Work very well!  I noticed the brightening, smoothing effect after ~1w.  This goes on similar to a &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; primer.  Immediately makes your face tone more even, non shiny, etc. and lays well under makeup.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Loce these beads. They make my skin feel so good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the point of the drops. The Body Shop offers the same product in a pump style. Much more convenient. I do love how soft my skin feels after these are applied to my face.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft and luminous.  Results are quick.  Have received many complements.  Am 72 years of age...Still gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before. Makes my skin so soft and I noticed less break outs when using it. It arrived quickly and can&#x27;t wait to start seeing results again.</li>
    <li> The box arrived open....and arrived quickly but I did not expect that arivasse with open box!!!!</li>
    <li> The stuff in these capsules makes my skin feel really smooth and I love the way it smells! Works well with other moisturizers too.</li>
    <li> In the past I have used very expensive products, for my face.  But since trying Lumene, I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else! I love it!</li>
    <li> These are by far the best skin product I use. I am 55 yrs old and grew up without the benefit odd sunscreen. As a red head, fair skinned individual I was sure i would get a bad report from the dermatologist butt she said&amp;#34;I don&#x27;t  know what you are doing but keep it up. Your skin is damage free and looks great. &amp;#34; I give full credit to these little drops.!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Immediate and lasting difference using this product.  I use it before bedtime - ONE little capsule is all you need.  My face looks smoother and feels so much better than many creams I have tried.  Some creams cause my skin to burn so I was happy to discover this product that  doesn&#x27;t and nor does it have a smell.  It absorbs immediately and isn&#x27;t heavy feeling at all.  Love it and plan to continue using it.</li>
