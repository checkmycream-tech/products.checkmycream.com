<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I enjoy the plates! Lots of unique designs. Some of the images do not pick up as easily, but not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these plates and I&#x27;m picky as hell lol, they stamp really good (I use a konad stamper,konad polish and an old credit card for scraping) I have bought plates from cheeky in the past and I&#x27;ve always been very happy. My only issue and really it&#x27;s not that big of a deal is on plate c the first one on the second to bottom row isn&#x27;t as detailed as shown in picture but other then that I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s a great price that blows konad out of the water! The people who run cheeky have always been very kind to answer any questions I have Thought up :) these images are huge and great for wide fingers  I hope u enjoy them as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I use this product almost every day. It&#x27;s fun and easy to use. The art selections are nice and I love they have a left and right sides.</li>
    <li> The images transfer really well, but some of the images repeat. I know that some are just reversed, but there are images that are exact copies... Kinda feel ripped off on that part.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted order these after hearing the stories I&#x27;ve heard about all of the \\&quot;fauxnad\\&quot; brands, BUT I was thrilled when they arrived....they are AWESOME!!!! Every design I&#x27;ve tried has worked and the patterns are SO BIG!!! They&#x27;re almost too big to fit on my large end of the Konad stamper! This is MUCH better for long or wide nails! Lastly, the designs are really cool! They seem much more updated than some of the Konad brands...although, I still love Konad too! :)</li>
    <li> Cheeky plates are the only ones I&#x27;ve ever used. When I saw this bundle, I had to get it. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tested out all the plates, but I&#x27;ve used a few designs here and there from this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to let you know, I received the following plates: A, B, C, D, E, and I. I&#x27;m not sure if everyone received the same exact plates as I did, but the plates I received were the ones pictured. There are a decent variety of designs, and a lot of the designs come in pairs so you could get matching designs on both hands. That&#x27;s one thing I really love about Cheeky plates. From what designs I HAVE used, they&#x27;ve been very detailed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! I don&#x27;t use Konad or any other stamping polishes. I just use ordinary nail polish, and the designs show up fine. I&#x27;m even thinking of experimenting with acrylic paints using these plates sometime in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, I definitely recommend this set. It&#x27;s a great value, has a nice variety of designs, and heck, they come on plastic backs so you won&#x27;t end up cutting yourself with sharp edges!</li>
    <li> they are beautiful and any one who bough them would love them. The have small ones for small fingers, and big for the bigger ones.</li>
    <li> The product is very good quality. I liked the variety of patterns and styles that can be represented in manicure. Many thanks for good quality, fast delivery and good packing.</li>
    <li> I just received my set of 6 of these plates.  I love the quality and size of the plates.  The nail image is the largest I have found yet. It easily covers any size nail. This makes stamping so much easier.  I love these!</li>
    <li> My first was the conad plate which was more about $ 6.00 per plate, so I decided to try some other brands like bundle monsters and shany plates.&lt;br /&gt;Bundle monster new version was OK but still too small for my thumbs or middle fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Shany was not only small, but also too dangerous to use due to it&#x27;s sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this jumbo plates here on amazon and ordered the six plates at once.&lt;br /&gt;They are fantastic. Big enough to cover full nails and images are beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use the conad and BM for small flowers or somethings, but for the whole nail stapming, These will be my life long friend.</li>
    <li> As with all plates, different polishes work better with different designs. This set offers a decent variety of designs. All of the designs are big enough to cover my entire nail, which I had trouble with when using different brand.  I didn&#x27;t give the product 5 stars because some of the designs were too similar.</li>
    <li> These are great! Wider and longer than most images. A few are difficult to get a good image on the stamper, but 95% of them work wonderful. I have narrow, but long nails and these do the job for me without having to double stamp to get the length of my nails all covered.</li>
    <li> The plates were shipped on time, and arrived in perfect condiction... so glad they contained protective support, amazing design.. i would totally buy more cheeky products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a real Konad junkie, but I gotta say that these are really, really great. I mean, really great. And having larger images means I can cover my thumbs. Yay! Arrived well packaged, all that I have tried have stamped very cleanly. Fabulous designs with mirror images, and plenty of sizes in the flourishes. Plenty of options, with lots of images including the french tip curve. A few of the designs appeared a bit boring in the product images and I thought I wouldn&#x27;t use them...I can honestly say that they are very appealing &#x27;in real life&#x27;, and there would be very few that I wouldn&#x27;t use. Very fast and friendly comm&#x27;s from Cheeky customer service. Will purchase again, with no hesitation. Outstanding value.</li>
    <li> really nice images the designs stamp well except for plate D  i gave the product three stars because of the trouble of having to return all my plates  when i only have problems with one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these plates for over a year and I am still not bored with these!! some of the finer images I have to work quick with or the polish will dry and not transfer. the only issue I remember having was that some of the images were not what they were supposed to be, but I didn&#x27;t have so much of a problem with it that I exchanged it, which I could have. overall I&#x27;ve been happy with the quality of the images. I will definitely order more. my only other complaint is there is no storage case, but I made one. would be great if they made a case</li>
    <li> The stamp is not long enough for long nails because of the curve at the end of the image. The size of the image at the middle of the curve is 1.7 cm. The size of the image on the side is 2 cm. The image is not square therefore not good for long nails. I have tried them and it works well.</li>
    <li> NICE GIFT FOR THESE  NAIL GURUS AND TEEN!!!</li>
    <li> not the quality I expected from Bundle monster.great images but Most images didnt pick up well and the etching was not the best. Maybe I just got a bad batch. would love them if this wasnt an issue.</li>
    <li> Though I like the nail plates themselves, I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about cheeky customer service.  I expected to buy new products, but the plates I got in were clearly used before.  I don&#x27;t mean just scratches as I expect those at times during manufacturing, but 2 of the plates were bent, one of the plastic backings was broken, and there were smudges from someone poorly attempting to clean one of them.  I wrote to cheeky asking if I could get the plates replaced, but they said they do not replace plates unless the stamping images were rendered unusable.  Not a fan, and will not be ordering from them again</li>
    <li> I just got these in the mail today and am so happy.Initially i did find it hard to pick up the images from plate A but I changed from my squishy stamper to konad stamper nd found the images pik up way better with Konad.I also found tht sometime tht may happen cz of the nail polish if it isnt thick enough..So dont lose hope.These plates are great.The images are crisp and clear.Variate with your polish and stampers if the images dont pik up because the plates are great.Im not such a big fan of plate E though.</li>
    <li> These plates are the best I have tried, and I have tried both other major brands of nail art plates.  I LOVE the symmetrical designs.</li>
    <li> Good quality and fast shipping love this seller</li>
    <li> I got this set from Amazon. Cheeky is either Terrible or great. This set was really, really great. Deep stamping that holds the polish well. I highly recomend this set.</li>
    <li> soooooo nice! love the plate bundle.. it had A B C D E and I plates. all the etchings are well made and detailed. well priced. didn&#x27;t pay anything for shipping and had the order delivered within a week. NICE!! covers entire nails- thumb nails as well. loved plate C.. it has Henna art designs- my favorite plates. girls, sadly you wont get any cartoons or labels or party hats.. or shoes on here! each plate has classy and sophisticated designs. plates are NOT sharp at the edge- it has a plastic backing. nicely made! no complaints. used the konad stamper and an old gift card for stamping. any drugstore nail polish will do.. just think about the color combos! plenty of &amp;#34;tutorials&amp;#34; online to learn the new and improved techniques available. good luck and happy stamping!</li>
    <li> I got this set for an affordable price. It has so many designs to play with. Very detailed.&lt;br /&gt;The images are much bigger. So it covers the full nail. Very good for beginners who take interest in nail art.&lt;br /&gt; The delivery was very quick. I got it a week before the date mentioned in the email.&lt;br /&gt; It is very good value for money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set of 6 plates for 39.99..you cant beat the prize plus zero shipping. As a prime member of amazon i was supposed to get the plates in two days...but guess what they came to me very next day..Yipee...Thank you Amazon..Its been a week that the plates are with me..They are working superb for me.All the designs are stamping very well and the backing (i got pink) is a wonderful idea. Cheeky u got a customer for life. I already have their summer set and now these Jumbo six plates .In future am planning to collect all the stamps.You won&#x27;t regret spending money. Just to mention here, do not clean the plates with regular cotton ball. You will make a mess and might ruin it for future stamping also. Instead of buying lint free cleaning pads i cleaned them with cotton rounds bought from Costco..they are working fine for me...</li>
    <li> I myself, have shorter nails, but these will work great for anyone with larger or longer nails. Most images work great. A few images on plate B are blurry, and one image is not etched fully, making it unusable. But other than that, the plates work well. If you have trouble picking up an image, sometimes using different polishes or an XL stamper may work better. It&#x27;s all trial &amp; error when it comes to stamping.</li>
    <li> I like the quality of the images. My only complaint is some of the images are so large that I can&#x27;t get the whole image on my nail. (but I do have smaller nail beds, so it would work well for someone with larger ones)</li>
    <li> I purchased these plates based on reviews, I&#x27;m so glas I did. I have very large nail bed and these plates cover them. The prints are unique and lovely. You won&#x27;t go wrong ordering these plates. The pricing is also a plus. I&#x27;m new to doing my own nails at home, but with these plates it makes my nails look so professional. I also do all my family now, who at one time went to salons. Thanks Cheeky for such great plates. Kathy in Ma</li>
    <li> good cheekys plates...Muy bueno me encantaron los plate y yegaron muy rapido antes de la fecha de envio ya creo q voy a compra mas de esta compania</li>
    <li> Was delivered in a timelymanner.  The plates are just as described.  I watched some You Tube video&#x27;s before ordering and read the reviews.  I decided to order them after looking at them for couple of months.  I am glad I did.  They work great.  I haven&#x27;t had a bad stamp yet but there are many to choose from I haven&#x27;t used them all yet.  I am not disappointed and would recommend these plates to anyone looking for a good combinations of images.</li>
    <li> These designs actually fit my entire nail.  I have long nail beds, so when my nails themselves grow they look at longer than they are due to the length of my nail beds.  I am glad that Cheeky made these plates. I love the designs as well.</li>
    <li> SOOO many designs, and excellent quality, use with metal scraper for best results. Also, you do get some repeated and weird looking design that you might not want to stamp but with the amount of designs you still get endless options. I got mine with a pink plastic backing which protects the plates from bending, and pink is pretty,&lt;br /&gt;Full nail design are big enough to cover entire nail, lot bigger than Konad plates and at a much more affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended, specially for nail stamping beginners!</li>
    <li> I have so far purchased many image stamping plates... but these Jumbo plates from Cheeky are the best of all! Highly recommended! Big images, for big nails, and small ones, of course:) Great variety of images, and some symmetrical images for both hands:) Great stamping quality... buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!:)</li>
    <li> I would love to review the product but I have not got it yet .It has been over a month now still waiting.</li>
    <li> So Awesome!! Love love this plates so happy I got them! Awesome price! They stamp very good.I use konad and regular nail polish. If you have the chance get them you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> These plates are friggin amazing. They are wide and long enough for my nails and I have pretty large nail beds. Every tiny detail (and there are a lot of tiny details) is visible in the stamping transfer.  The clean up is not as big as a problem as other make it out to be. You need PURE acetone to clean them properly or else you get the &amp;#34;stains&amp;#34; people complain about.</li>
    <li> The only reason I have taken one star away is because I feel some of the designs are just too intricate to get them on your nail in a recognizable fashion. I have tried them with several different polishes and still cant get a few of them to transfer. Most that I have tried though turn out nice and are really pretty.</li>
    <li> I love this, I used it lastnite. I really enjoy using nail stamps. I would buy this item before I would buy any other nail stamping products, Beautiful designs and easy to use (after a little practice, youtube is great for that).</li>
    <li> I have many Konad plates, bundle monster plate sets, the Kaynig plate set, Mash plate sets, and the 2011 Cheeky plate sets so i have stamped a lot of images and have decent amount of experience with using the Konad stamping system. While the images are absolutely beautiful on these larger plates, the ones i received were etched too deeply (usually i have the other issue with non-Konad plates being etched too shallow). Since they are too deeply etched, the polish floods the plates and causes way too much polish to be left on the image so the image is blurry when stamped. Even after scraping over and over the deep images still have way too much polish. Not all images did this however. Some of them stamped well but those were the ones that did not have intricate designs and even then they were really flooded with nail polish. Anything with too much detail stamped like a blob. I have seen images of other people using this set with beautiful results so i can only assume that the ones i received were defective. I have read from a couple other reviews online that they received replacements that worked great when they also received too deeply etched plates so i am keeping my fingers crossed that i will receive a second set that works. Since the set i ordered was fulfilled by Amazon, they only allow for a return and not an exchange, however i will definitely reorder them once again when i get a refund since i would love a set that works well. The images are fantastic for sure.</li>
    <li> The fine small images are too Fine to pick up on to the stamper. The bold images are lightly better, i guess you can fault the stamper for that.&lt;br /&gt;To your nowledge, not all nail polishes can be used with cheeky stamper as I experienced.&lt;br /&gt;I have a wide range of nail colour products and only 1 or 2 that work with the stampers and plates.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy with the results., as it took several attempts to just get 4 fingers done.&lt;br /&gt;If any one can give any advice please help.&lt;br /&gt;cheeky stampers are too greasy to pick up the image from the image plates even after cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have received my orders without delay and I am very impressed by the image plate. What you see online is exactly what you get in the post. :)  i have tried it out that weekend and honestly i am extremely happy and satisfied with the product,  it was a good buy and i would recommend to those nail art lovers out there.  I am sure you wil not regret it. Have fun and enjoy stamping...</li>
    <li> It is great deal because you get a lot of plates.  The reason I gave it just 3 stars is that some the images do not stamp well.  I have been stamping for a while and could not pick up some of the images no matter what technique I tried.  I think it is an issue with the engraving of the image on the plate.</li>
    <li> My plates came from China, so I had to wait a while for them, but they still arrived before the estimated dates. If you&#x27;re ordering and they&#x27;re coming from China, be prepared for a good wait (many weeks) and no tracking number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plates came each glued to a pink plastic back, which is a great material, not slippery, but really, really stinky. They have a very strong chemical smell that is starting to dissipate after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The images on all of my plates are well-etched and crisp, clean designs for the most part, with the exception of the center row of plate E. Those designs are kind of blobby. I don&#x27;t think the problem is the etching, but the designs just aren&#x27;t well done and I don&#x27;t know what some of them are supposed to be, although they look like they wanted to be something, not just a blobby pattern. There are enough other useful designs on the plate, regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed is that I have to scrape these designs carefully. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re not entirely flat or what, but especially with some of the very symmetrical and highly detailed designs, it&#x27;s important to scrape with a little more pressure than I use on other plates or the design will end up blurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving these five stars because the price is fantastic, the designs are great and versatile (and I&#x27;m in love with the numerous snake and reptile prints - try those out over a 3-D effect magnetic polish - wow!) and of course, plate C is the stuff dreams are made of ;) Plate I doesn&#x27;t have a ton of different designs, but many in mirror image and each in two sizes. This is great if you want a nice looking, consist design on both hands on large and small nails. Since I play guitar, I have very short nails on my left hand, but longer thumb nails and moderately long nails on my right fingers, so the variety in size choices is good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the full nail designs measure 9/16 by 11/16 to the center and 3/4 inch along the sides (15, 18 and 20 mm), so they are much larger than most full nail images, which I really, really appreciate. The only others I know of this size are the Cheeky Summer 2012 plates. I&#x27;ll be using a lot of the designs on plates A and B on my thumbs to go along with cute designs from other sets that are too small and will only fit on my other fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll want an XL stamper to work with these, particularly if you have longer nails or wide nail beds like I do on my thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip for stamping the very geometric designs: don&#x27;t press too hard with the stamper on the plates or your nail, or the design will warp. Practice with those before trying them on nails to work out the technique - it might be different than the way you normally work. It is for me, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled with the quality, price and variety of this set, and especially the size of full nail designs, and how many of the designs can be used partially on a nail to get a different look or to accommodate much longer nails.des (15, 18 and 20 mm), so they are much larger than most full nail images, which I really, really appreciate.

    <li> I own a few different kinds of plates, and these are great, with a few being stand-out favorites. I really like how some images are mirror images so your nails look nice when you hold, say, your thumbs up together and the image goes in opposite directions. I know that sounds weird, it was hard to articulate.... but  hopefully you get the idea. The only reasosn I didn&#x27;t give it that last star was because some of the images, not meant to be mirror images, were VERY similar, with only very slight variations. I mean, how many different swirly, or little circle images do you *really* need on one plate :)? But I love these plates so I can live with a little repetition. As soon as I have the money i WILL be ordering the new (2013? i think) Cheeky image plates :)</li>
    <li> Received extremely fast.  Good quality and love the additional backing to prevent bending of the plates.  The jumbo images unfortunately do not cover my long nails. Very disappointed with that.</li>
    <li> The design options with this kit are awesome! The plates are high quality and easy to store. Love them!</li>
    <li> Love these plates.  I received A, B, C, D, E, and I.  The designs are so intricate and unique.  And the stamps come out clean and clear on my nails.  The quality of the plates is excellent.  These should last for a very long time if taken care of.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying all of the patterns eventually.</li>
    <li> The stamps are to small for my nails, overall they were working really well. Good buy for someone with short nails.</li>
    <li> a few minor scratches here and there but it still works great. Love they way they make my nails look &#x3D;)</li>
