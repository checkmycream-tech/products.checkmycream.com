<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is already helping clear my skin!</li>
    <li> Love the mask! It leaves skin feeling firm, refreshed and toned. Clears without over drying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy that doesn&#x27;t really use a lot of &amp;#34;beauty products&amp;#34;. Seems to work and feel great and now I have my wife using it too!</li>
    <li> My face gets nasty in the winter. It gets scaly and flaky. I hate it! This mask really helps with that. It isn&#x27;t drying at all. It removes blackheads and prevents acne, it makes my skin feel amazing and gives me a summer glow. I love how it feels on my skin too. It feels like it opens up my pores and cools them off. It&#x27;s a nice tingly feeling. I love it!</li>
    <li> First of all I LOVE how freaking cute the packaging is! I have done many different masks in my lifetime and I always have a routine of doing them on Sundays so I can start off my week with a fresh face. I usually apply the mask and then when its all dry I hop in the shower that way I can get all of the stuff off of my face and not have some mask still left in my hair because I always manage to get some into my hair. I really love the smell of mint masks and how it really feels like all the toxins are coming out of your skin and you can see little oil spots on your face. This is such a great value and I would recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> This is my first clay mask and I must say that I love it. Before this, I tried countless acne pads and acne face washes but none of them worked well for me. This clay mask is amazing! Although it feels a bit strange on your face for a while, the feeling afterwords is amazing. The minty, cool sensation is relaxing, but the results afterwords are even better. My skin feels softer and smoother than before. Although acne results are immediate, the mask will definitely improve acne after a few more uses.</li>
    <li> Was definitely skeptical when I first saw this cream, but it is AMAZING! It works like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. Works to remove acne, and I had a couple of scratches from shaving that it cleaned right up, no scars at all. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great facial mask. It did exactly what its desccription said. After using it for about two weeks, my acne started to get reduced and the redness is not as obvious anymore. The size of my pimples also got reduced. In addition, it helps to peel of my bad skins, and deeply cleans my skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> Have tried it a few times now.  Instructions say to leave on 20 min but I find that it dries well by 5-10 min, so I remove it after this happens.  My skin feels soft after, and the product has a nice smell.  My skin is oily/combo.  No reduction in blackheads on nose, but maybe I need to use more often.  Although the jar is small, it does not take a lot of product to get good coverage of the face and neck, so I estimate it will last me about 2 months if I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> I have harsh, red scars from cystic acne on my chin and on both of my cheek bones. I&#x27;ve found NOTHING that helps fade the scars; only stuff for current breakouts. After just a couple uses I could see the scars beginning to fade. I was however displeased with how small the container is, but well worth it in the end!</li>
    <li> I always thought pimples and blackheads just magically disappeared as we became adults. I was definitely wrong! As I got older, my facial skin got pretty bad. I started having major breakouts. Then, I found Beauty Facial Extreme Clay Mint Healing Mask. I was thrilled to learn that it contains natural ingredients. I have been using this product 3 times a week and have seen an amazing difference. My skin is a lot clearer and is no longer oily. My face looks healthier and cleaner than ever before. My pores are much smaller and my face is very soft. I absolutely love the Beauty Facial Extreme products!!</li>
    <li> I remember my friend recommending that I start using overnight masks for my acne problems, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should of believed her. Regardless I decided I would at least research it a bit and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came down to three different masks to choose from, and I ended up choosing this one because of the great reviews and promises the company made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now and I am having great results! I have a clear, moisturizerized face and have more self confidence in how I look now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Cost!&lt;br /&gt;2) Destroyed my acne!&lt;br /&gt;3) Didn&#x27;t dry my skin up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Have to be conservative in the amount I use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do recommend this product to anyone needing to fix their skin!</li>
    <li> I felt like Zelena from once upon a time when I tried used this face mask. I have extremely sensitive skin and often breakout from facial masks or other face products. It tingled a little but does not burn like other facial masks I have tried in the past. My face feels extremely smooth and my pores feel like they are free. I swear my face hasn&#x27;t felt like this from any other face mask. I simply applied a thin layer on my face, let it set for 20 minutes, then rinse it off with warm water and that&#x27;s it! When I rinsed it off my face did not feel dry, did not have any signs of irritation, I did not break out at all and the green pigment of the facial mask did not stain my skin! I really like the way this facial mask works and would definitely recommend it to people.  These are absolutely my very own honest opinion after having received and try this product for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> It is not working on me.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel fresh clean i recommend it to everyone i know</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had an issue with pores and blackheads and this mask did wonders. I&#x27;ve tried facials, strips, etc. to no avail. I&#x27;ve been using this facial mask for ~3 weeks now and my pores have noticeably shrunk and my blackheads have lightened. Will definitely continue using this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is very nice i recommend this to anyone and everyone who wants to clear up there face or just wants to clear and smooth it out and it does not have to be your face it can be your legs or arms also.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks. It doesn&#x27;t really work... Kinda disappointing. I wonder why so many people give such wonderful review... I will keep using it and see.</li>
    <li> I love it. My skin is soft and I think it removed my eye bags. It hasn&#x27;t show up in several days.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial mask ..I love the way that this feels when it goes on the face u feel a slight cooling feeling and it really helps with breakage out and acne ..A product that does what is states ..I love it</li>
    <li> My sister had many infections on the face, legs and hands. She tried many acne skin products that didn&#x27;t work. The moment I came across Clay Mint mask, I encouraged her to give it an attempt. The pimples, acne scars, white and blackheads are diminishing. Her skin is becoming clearer day in day out. I recommend it.</li>

    <li> I really like the smell of mint, which just freshen my mind too. This is a lovely facial mask. After starting using this facial mask, my skin feels softer than earlier. Dark spots seem a bit lighter and no more new pimples till now. This mask is easy to apply, though you need a little bit extra time to wash it out. This facial mask has a nice, refreshing mint smell that I find very soothing.</li>
    <li> Awesome mask cleansor, really feels fresh after applying.</li>

    <li> I wanted to find a face mask that was gentle on my skin. This product worked wonders on my skin and I have decided to order another months supply. If you want better skin I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use to try various face masks, but none of these products gave such a good result as Beauty facial extreme face mask. This face mask helps us in regeneration of clear skin without any black heads and for reducing acne. Never miss out these products which will improves our skin softness and provides beauty constantly.</li>
    <li> This face mask worked wonders in my acne filled face. I also got rid of my oily face and a regular application gives my face a oil free and pleasant look.</li>
    <li> I love putting face packs actually. And I prefer product containing natural ingredients. As I started using this product I experienced the clearer skin. It exfoliates, removes excess oil and impurities from deep. It heals skin issues like pimples, blackheads leaving your skin feeling clean, clear and soft. Overall a good product...</li>
    <li> Your face is definitely getting the works with this product. I was 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> Used about a month and see a little results</li>
    <li> This mask is really good! It makes my skin smoother ang whenever I get pimples it dries up easily after puting this mask.</li>
    <li> After starting using this facial mask, my skin feels softer than earlier. I really like the smell of mint, which just freshen my mind too. Dark spots seem a bit lighter and no more new pimples till now. This mask  is easy to apply, though you need a little bit extra time to wash it out. Love to recommend to my friends, who also are suffering from pimples, black spots, and damaged skin problems.</li>
    <li> When I received this the top was busted. After screwing the top off the lid was off and half of the product was already gone.</li>
    <li> This is very effective for blemishes and blackheads.  I would follow their advice and use the gel cleanser and pads with it.  Even for adults, this is great for improving your complexion!</li>
    <li> My daughter likes this product.</li>
    <li> works well and I use it with other products in this same line to keep my adult acne under control without drying out my skin</li>
    <li> This mask works. I love how my face feels so refreshing and clean after.</li>
    <li> I just received the product and am disappointed that the jar is super small to be so pricey... no one mentioned that in their review... I can fit in the palm of my babys hand its so small... hope its all worth the money :-(</li>
    <li> This is a very deep cleansing facial wash. It exfoliates the skin and cures acne. It is a facial powder which is easily appliable to the skin. Thanks!</li>
    <li> So, I like it.  Its veryyy expensive though so it&#x27;s unlikely I reorder.  The pro&#x27;s are it seems to work well and it doesn&#x27;t have any negatives.  It burns a little but not for long. I use a dozen or more products, so no one single things is going to be my cure-all or favorite, but in combo, they make my skin better.  this product works better for me if my face is mostly dry or dry and my fingers are completely dry, I leave it on about 30 mins.  Its VERY green.  I wish the price would come down so I can order again.  Usually products take moisture from my face or irritate it so even if they work, they cause a different problem, but not this mask.  If money was no object I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic mask! Exfoliates well clearing away black heads and dead skin cells.</li>
    <li> Really good, you can barely feel the sulfur</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve been using mask twice a week and my skin looks rejuvenated and much clearer.</li>
    <li> Just received this in the mail , haven&#x27;t tried it yet , pretty sure it will work , I just can&#x27;t believe I paid almost $40 for such a small jar , I did not like that AT ALL!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find out that beauty facial extreme cleanser also had a face mask! I love face masks but this mint one is just so great! It clears up my skin and leaves it feeling soft, clean and bright! I&#x27;ve told all my friends about my secret to glowing skin. It&#x27;s not a secret! It&#x27;s this awesome facial clay mint mask. You have got to try it for yourselves.</li>
    <li> Sometimes after a wash you want that extra skin tightening ! This works better than most expensive masks I&#x27;ve used ! Adorable and reliable !</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the wonderful reviews, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I was born with large pores on my nose, and they accumulate sweat and dirt and cause &amp;#34;blackheads.&amp;#34;  This simple solution is clearing them up and it feels great and fresh on my face whenever I use it.</li>
    <li> I like this. The mint makes my skin feel like it can actually breathe like it&#x27;s supposed to. Then the other natural stuff goes in and deep cleans.I love that.</li>
    <li> This product is an answered prayer. Whoever decided on the marketing of these types of products needs an award. I can&#x27;t stop buying them. All of my younger relatives look at the bottles and start laughing. Not only does it help me with my facial imperfections but it helps give a whole different feel to family time. Of course I would buy it again. Because of the response in my home I should probably buy some for the neighbors because they need a reason to smile.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely facial mask. You&#x27;re face opens up and feels fresh and new while using this product. I started using this and my blackheads gradually started going away. Lovely!</li>
    <li> Who needs spa treatment when you have a face mask like this? I love it!</li>
    <li> Best facial mask I own. You get the clinical strength and results without having to deal with dry skin or breaking your budget.</li>
    <li> This product is very good I got it just smoother skin/acne and also the annoying issue of blackheads till this day it has been doing its job</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product, not only has it restored the condition of my skin to a much healthier quality, It has also visibly tightened my pore&#x27;s, I have recommended this product to my sister also as it really is extremely good, It&#x27;s also a bonus that it is made from all natural products and no nasty harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliation agent also works very well leaving my skin feeling soft and fresh for the rest of the day, If you are planning on trying any facial mask, make sure it is this one!</li>
    <li> This mask feels awesome! It has a refreshing cool minty feeling to it. I leave it on for about 20 minutes until it&#x27;s dry, and then I wash it off. Afterwards I can tell it really helps to clean my pores.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it burned my face</li>
    <li> I am a sucker for all things mint, and I love tea tree oil and clay masks, so I really was happy to try this. Since using it, I have been able to use so much less concealer, my skin feels amazing. It works so well on my monthly acne issues... if you know what I mean ladies ;-) and it has cleared up the impossibly stubborn blackheads on my nose that I felt were never going away. This product is a miracle worker. Not to mention, the retro packaging is just TOO CUTE, I can&#x27;t wait to get another to give as gifts for the holidays.</li>
    <li> This is my first time to write a review. It works awesome! It feels cool when you apply it.</li>
    <li> very good as what it describes Deep cleansing and acne destroyer I have been using this for about 5 months and god does it feel good to be acne free and this product does not burn like others and has a good texture</li>
    <li> This facial mask has a nice, refreshing mint smell that I find very soothing. I get a slight tingling sensation shortly after applying it and it leaves my face feeling soft and smooth after I rinse it off.</li>
    <li> I am very surprised by this product.  I initially went looking for new charcoal facial mask and after reading reviews, I bought this sulphur based product instead.  I have allergies and immunities to most antibiotics the only ones left at my disposal and sulfa drugs.  That being said, I chose this for that reason as well as the reviews.  This works great.  It is a little drying.  I have mature but great skin that tends to react to just about everything.  As a natural redhead, I have very sensitive skin and still break out in my 60&#x27;s.  Yeah, blemishes aren&#x27;t just for teens.  Anyway, my biggest skin complaint beside the sensitivity is the excess sebum that ends up as white heads.  My cheeks pores tend to congest very easily.  This is mainly from medications for health conditions.  The med&#x27;s keep me looking younger than my years but reek havoc on my skin.  This is cool, soothing and brings the sebum to the surface so with either a warm cloth or skin tool (loop) scraped across the skin they pop right out and are removed.  Even the enlarged pores are reduced greatly.  I use twice a week and follow with neroli oil hydrating spray and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really like a cover up that actually performs. I&#x27;ve always strugged with discovering something that will help me with toxins on my temple and dark leads around my nasal area area. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of covers and none seem to be operating successfully eventually. My bf suggested this clay-based great cover up and i made the decision to try. I&#x27;m definitely repurchasing this, it solved my epidermis before you know it. Great item.</li>
    <li> It smells great. It is also easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This facial mask is great!</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item works in the long run it seems. I will purchase again to see how it works, if not, I do not recommend it and it does not take away blackheads</li>
    <li> Very nice facial mask, your face would feel fresh after each time you put it on. It works great for everybody.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. at first i didn&#x27;t believe in it. I thought it was just a cheap product but boy was i wrong. My face is way cleaner now. I highly recommend you using it.</li>
    <li> Dealing with eczema is a daunting and time consuming skin ailment. This facial mask has provided me with the peace of mind and relief I have long been searching for. I have previously used steroid based creams to deal with my eczema and they worked fairly well but they are also very time consuming, in that you have to apply them so often. I only need to use the mask once a day and I know that my skin will feel refreshed and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Works great! No complaints</li>
    <li> With so many clay masks out there this is one of my favorite mud masks I have tried. I have had really bad skin from the combination of oily and dry, acne, blackheads, and uneven skin tone. I used this clay mask and from the moment I put the mask on I can feel the impurities being lifted from my skin. After a few uses my skin is softer, smooth, my combination of oil and dry is gone, and my skin is even. I used to pile makeup on my face to hide my blemishes but now I am confident enough to leave the house without make up on.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this for my teenager who experiences bouts of acne. Not only did it clear his skin, it also gave it a bit of a glow. I tried it myself to see if I would get similar effects and the results are amazing.</li>
    <li> When used with cleansing pads it leaves my skin looking fresh and younger</li>
    <li> This facial mask contains some of the best ingredients for the care of your skin, and the mint feel is so tingly, you feel like you&#x27;re at the spa. Not only do you get that spa feel, but the spa-like results are evident. Your skin is cared for, looks clean, refreshed and refined after using this product.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this mask in conjunction with the company&#x27;s scrub product. I complete the microdermabrasion scrub first, then rinse, then pat my face, and while it is still slightly damp I apply the gel mask. It goes on nice as a thin minty layer that dries quickly. I leave it on for the recommended 20 minutes, sometimes longer, then rinse with warm water and pat my face dry.  I also use it and the scrub on areas of my body where I have eczema, and they help my skin heal faster and remain healed longer.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product... It gives your skin a clean look.. Pores are nicely cleaned ..... acne marks appear less reddish...Skin is well moisturized... My mom tried it too and it worked nicely for her too... Must try</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mint, its a face mask, its totally to die for, I put this on, sit back, put on some relaxing music and give myself a little spa day whenever I need a breather! -rrc</li>
    <li> Loved this product.  I have already purchased my second one because of the quick results.</li>
    <li> My face is very clear now. I have no more pores, blackheads, or blemishes. I give this product 5 stars for its quality and it works great for the price!</li>
    <li> Most healing masks I&#x27;ve found actually leave my skin too dry. This clay mint healing mask is different, and it makes my face feel soft and luxurious all day!</li>
    <li> This product has suited well for my sensitive skin and has removed my acne scars. It has also helped me in deep pore cleaning. I don&#x27;t mind recommending this. Try if it suits you first.</li>
    <li> GREAT!  I&#x27;m HOOKED!  This mask is amazing!  I use the EXFOLIATING CLEANSER before I put on the mask.  I am going to order the other cleanser and the lotion as well.  It really makes my skin smooth.  I LOVE it!  And, I am not one to spend alot of money on anything like this but, I have to say..  It&#x27;s totally worth it!  You will not be disappointed!  Enjoy! :)</li>
    <li> Great product, I love a mask that actually works. I&#x27;ve always find it hard to finding something that will help me with pores on my forehead and black heads around my nose area. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of masks and none seem to be working effectively over time. I have used this for several weeks now and seems to be doing a great job on my skin.</li>
    <li> First off let me say I love the mint scent it makes its makes the skin feel so refresh . It really does help with clearing the black heads from the skin. I can say I&#x27;m loving the product and will keep buying !!</li>
    <li> I love love the smell of mint .. Makes me feel my skin feel so refresh . I love using face masks. I&#x27;ve been using this product for weeks now and I feel and see a complete difference already.</li>
    <li> didn&#x60;t work @ all !!!</li>
    <li> This facial mask does its job. I love it and everyone should try this out if you have skin problems like acne or want your skin to glow. This really works!</li>
    <li> Nice and soothing mask. I think it evens out the skin tone as well however I did not see any drastic effects on my skin. Will use it but will not repurchase, especially at that price (over 30$).</li>
