    <li> I love this stuff, my face is very sensitive. it works!</li>
    <li> I use Olay lotion- and because of recent surgeries I decided to give the &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin Olay&amp;#34; a try-- so glad I did-- non greasy but soothing and same fresh fragrance - Thanks for the great service and product</li>
    <li> This is my go to product it works so well on my skin that I use it as a body lotion. If you have sensitive skin like I do it&#x27;s the best lotion you can buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for decades!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Light, Unscented and Lovely:&lt;br /&gt;I love the lightness and quick absorbency of the lotion.  I have used it exclusively for 10 years and still have beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> Olay has changed their formula for sensitive skin and they have added SPF. Some of us with very sensitive skin can&#x27;t put SPF on our faces, so I am very thankful that I can still find this product on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  My skin feels so soft.</li>
    <li> This is the old formula of Oil of Olay. I bought it for my wife as a stocking stuffer, and I&#x27;ll admit I use it myself on occasion. I was really happy to find someone selling the old formula, which we can&#x27;t find in stores in our area anymore. It does not have any sunblock in it and it isn&#x27;t greasy at all. We love it, and hope the Olay people return to this formula.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and I feel like it makes my face feel more oily.  I think maybe the formula has changed.  I used to like this stuff.  I don&#x27;t feel like it absorbs into my skin very well.  Not for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and I recently ran out.  I was not able to find it anywhere. Only the one with sunscreen was available.  I have very sensitive skin and it was not good for me. I received my order today and am so happy to have this lotion back. It is wonderful! Thank you for still selling it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery happy with product</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and also the Olay Sensitive Complete. The value is great and glad to have found through Amazon, because our stores here in Las Vegas are caring the beauty fluid for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I deal with eczema and at times can be very trying.  After having a bad reaction to medication, the Dermotologist recommended this product.  It works GREAT!!!!  Now the stores stopped stocking.  I have ordered before online and received the wrong product.  Those filling the order have to be careful and make certain they are sending the correct one. It has to be exact, \\&quot;Sensitive Skin\\&quot; upc# 7560900749 1.  Thank you Amazon for providing this product.  My wife uses many other Olay products and finds them all very satisfactory.  She says, \\&quot;Fantastic\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive to fragrances, sun-screen, and many kinds of lotion - this is particularly true for my face.  I have used this fragrance free for sensitive skin lotion for years, and in my opinion it is the best around.  It goes on very smooth, is not greasy, and is absorbed quickly.  In recent years, Olay have started adding sun-screen to this lotion, which totally ruins it for me (the lotion becomes gooey and greasy).  It is becoming hard to find the original product in stores.  Thankfully, it can be ordered.  I only reduced by one start due to the cost, but when compared to other specialty face creams, it is actually quite reasonable.</li>
    <li> No product seems to do as it claims. It&#x27;s okay. I like that it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin as some products do.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere. So glad to find it, my favorite moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before, but this product is special. I have used Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid for Sensitive Skin for years.  When it started disappearing from stores, I was very upset.  It is the perfect daily moisturizer for people like me, who have extremely sensitive skin.  I have never had one single problem with this product, and my skin looks so much better when I use it.  I especially like the non-greasy formula.  As other people have mentioned, Olay seems to have discontinued this product in favor of one that contains sunscreen.  Unfortunately, the sunscreen makes my eyes red and watery by the end of the day.  They could easily have 2 different versions -- one with and one without sunscreen -- and I wish they would listen to this suggestion.  In the meantime, I am so happy to be able to order it.</li>
    <li> A lotion that I&#x27;ve used for years.  I am afraid, however, that Olay may eliminating this specialized (sensitive skin) version in favor of &amp;#34;something new &amp; better&amp;#34;.  (My experience is that this is not often the case.)</li>
    <li> This is the best I have tried for my sensitive  skin, and I&#x27;ve tried everything. No breakouts at all, and keeps my skin fresh and moisturized.  It&#x27;s not fancy, just the basic moisturizer. I use it with a wrinkle cream, and it works so well... I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years....couldn&#x27;t find it in duane reade or riteaid....very, very happy amazon carries it....excellent for your face and neck.</li>
    <li> I wear glasses and for years I had a red, irritated, dandruff-like flakiness through my eyes and at the top of the bridge of my nose. It so happened I had to go to a dermatologist for an unrelated issue who recommended this product. I tried it and soon the entire skin condition was gone. As a thrifty shopper I tried other products but none of them worked. I have used this product for probably 15 years or so and I hope it never goes away or changes formula. I am male and this is odor free. It just plain works which is the best endorsement I can give any product.</li>
