<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve used did a compared test with my other brands and hands down the best. Will definitely buy more thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> This does a good job. I have been wet shaving for several years. Although I prefer Proraso formulations, this compares favorably to the Colonel Cronk soaps at a much better price. I use this as my weekday shaves and Proraso for Sunday mornings.</li>
    <li> For a great shave I would say this soap gets the job done with ease. It is not a high quality soap but for what you pay you get a product well worth the value. It will dry up if u dont shave right away so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest applying until your in front of the mirror ready to shave. I use it to shave my head only so I dont know how well it does as far as on the face bcuz my face is lot more sensitive than my head.</li>
    <li> Great product, lightning fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but I can&#x27;t seem to generate a thick lather.</li>
    <li> one bar lasts a long time</li>
    <li> great soap now seeing it in stores.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years, wish they made a 3 inch puck for my Col. Conk mug.</li>
    <li> This soap creates a very nice lather and smells fantastic.  It reminds me of Candies cologne for men.  I bought the Van Der Hagen Luxury shave set with the soap and I am impressed with everything.     This soap will make shaving a breeze and leaves a moisturized face.  I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the art of shaving properly. This is the first soap I&#x27;ve tried and I think I found a winner. Nice lather, smooth shave, nice subtle fragrance. If your going to start shaving the right way try it out.</li>
    <li> I have used both the luxury and deluxe versions of this soap. They both are exactly the same except the scent and color. Both provide nice thick lather. I always keep a few VDH soaps as my go-to and everyday soaps. Best thing is, you can buy this stuff at the local Walmart. Just remember to leave this soap on your face for 2-3 minutes before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cannot build lather with this soap, use a BOAR brush. Badger brushes are too soft to pick soap from this puck. Together with using a boar brush, I built lather directly on the face. I don&#x27;t use any preshave oils because they can ablate the production of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So remember two things: boar brush and building lather directly on face.</li>
    <li> it lubricates the area if well lathered, but leaves my skin very dry. Even the areas that I din&#x27;t shave (lips, upper cheeks) get really dry.</li>
    <li> I use this for my legs every shave. I don&#x27;t like the aerosol foam shaving cream, personally its a waste of money in my opinion.  It has a great smell , very moisturizing, and it gives a great lather. I have used &amp;#34;shaving soap&amp;#34; for years now and this in my opinion is the best smelling one.</li>
    <li> My hubs is active duty military and &amp;#34;cuts his hair twice a week.&amp;#34; Aka shaves his head bald. This is such a great product per him! He said not too much lather and gives him the closest best shave ever!</li>
    <li> I started using Van Der Hagen shaving soaps for over 10 years.  When they came out with the Luxury Line I ordered it as soon as Amazon listed it.  I have used one whole puck and started on another.  It is the best shaving soap I have tryed!  Buy it and try it.  As with all pucks covering the puck with hot water for 3-5 minutes will ensure you can build a great lather wither you face or bowl lather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet-shaving a long time and have used a variety of soaps and creams. Years ago I was using Van Der Hagen because it was readily available in drug stores. Then I started buying so-called luxury soaps online. Tabac, D.R. Harris, and the like became favorites and VDH was pushed to the back of the cabinet. Recently, VDH released a new \\&quot;luxury soap\\&quot; at a reasonable price. The basic VDH soaps are good performers and cheap, but are outclassed by many others out there. I had to at least try it and at about three dollars a puck, I felt I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The first thing I noticed is that this new soap is an once larger than the old VDH. The packaging is attractive, and obviously meant to appeal to people accustomed to more expensive soaps. The scent is light and refreshing. I&#x27;m not very good at discribing scents, but it has a hint of cucumber in it. If you like TOBS avocado, you&#x27;ll probably like this. But how does it perform? Well, it lathers easily, though not as well as Tabac, which is my personal gold standard. A little experimentation with the soap/water ratio yeilds good results. The lather is slick and cushioning. It lasts long enough to shave, but don&#x27;t dawdle or it will dry out on your face. As I have somewhat oily skin, I don&#x27;t concern myself much with moisturizing qualities. But this soap seems to give decent skin care and shouldn&#x27;t dry your skin over much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I closing, this soap is probably the best there is at this price point. It won&#x27;t replace the more expensive soaps, but I think I will keep it in my rotation anyway. If you are on a budget, this is a great choice that will provide good shaves without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> To date the best shave soap I&#x27;ve used.  The lather (using good badger hair brush) is abundant and the scent is subtle and clean....wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Simply this best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve switched to using soap for shaving and this is a very nice choice.  Bought the 3 pack and still on the first bar.&lt;br /&gt;This will last a good long while, great item!</li>
    <li> A lot of folks like 20 and 30 dollar pucks of soap into have tried a few. like Taylor and  few others. Van der Hagen soap works just as good leaves my face feeling great and soft smells good. And I can three pucks of soap for the price of one Taylor.</li>
    <li> The first time I saw this soap I was taken off guard. It was at Target who only carries mostly disposable razors and canned gunk/goo. The Every Man Jack line is probably the only good thing going there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw that the price of this soap was about 2x the cost of the \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; VDH soap and had nicer packaging. I was pissed &#x27;cause I thought the \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; was bein&#x27; discontinued so I drove over to WalMart and picked up 6 \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; pucks to save money and stock up. A few weeks later I was at Target and buying other stuff so I decided to &#x27;take the plunge&#x27; and buy a \\&quot;scented\\&quot; as the packaging is so seductive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the smell/\\&quot;scent\\&quot; is like a mix  of a couple colognes I have, sort of a rip-off somewhat. The \\&quot;Luxury\\&quot; puck is larger than the normal \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; puck. The soap works well but I don&#x27;t actually notice a difference between this \\&quot;Luxury\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; soap. This \\&quot;Luxury\\&quot; soap lasts a very, very long time though. I&#x27;ve been using my puck for a couple of months exclusively and it&#x27;s now only down to the size of a regular Williams puck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this \\&quot;Luxury\\&quot; puck soap is worth buying for the longevity it has. Is it better than the \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot;? I truthfully can&#x27;t tell a difference. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble using different shave soaps. I can definitely prefer one safety razor over another but with shave soaps I can use anything and get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At under $4 a puck this \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; soap is very much worth the money. I also recommend the Van Der Hagen Badger Brush which is also available at Target for $10. I have a Parker silvertip and the $10 brush worked just as great for me. It retains lots of water, has medium-soft bristles and gets an amazingly thick lather w/ super minimal shedding. I absolutely loved it and don&#x27;t see a need to spend $60 for a silvertip when the VDH is so similar minus the heavier handle and slightly softer bristles. Cheers to wetshavers!</li>
    <li> This soap is right up there with the best soaps I have used.  And I have not missed too many.  Makes a great and alot of lather. As with most soaps- use a good deal of water and I definately reccomend a decent badger brush.  This soap comes in a nice large puck which fits my old Old Spice mug very well.  Give it a good 35- 45 second scrub over and then add a bit of hot water and lather on your face.  Add more water to preference and it will give you at least enough lather for 3-4 passes.  I do recommend this soap and will keep it high in my rotation.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shave soap. I&#x27;ve bought several shave soaps, but this one is a true winner. It lathers great, not too thick and not too thin - just right. The scent is also fantastic, reminds me of the good ol&#x27; days with my dad at the barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip: Keep your brush damp as you&#x27;re applying this soap on your shave brush. The lather will be really slick rather and will help your face stay moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used VDH Deluxe for years, and it&#x27;s a good soap at a bargain price.      The VDH Luxury is a definite step up, and it provides excellent lather, great cushioning and slickness.    FOr the price, it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap so much. He has to use this and only this. It smells so good on him too.</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a brush and mug in 1967 with \\&quot;Old Spice\\&quot; soap,  and then \\&quot;Mennen\\&quot;.  During the period I tred various others including \\&quot;English Leather\\&quot;, \\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bee\\&quot;, \\&quot;Burma Shave\\&quot;, and anything else available locally.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used \\&quot;Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond Street Shaving Creame\\&quot;.  Which is the best, but pricey.&lt;br /&gt;In 2009 I switched to Van Der Hagen that was available at Walmart, this produced, I thought, the best lather possible.  My brother-in-law encouraged me to try \\&quot;Col. Cronk Bay Rum\\&quot;.  Wow an incredible shave.  I found \\&quot;VDH Luxury\\&quot; soap at Amazon and decided to give it a try.  This soap is the best lather I have ever used.  Easy to work with and lasts.  The price is very reasonable.  This is now my everyday shaving soap.</li>
    <li> good product for beginning wetshavers</li>
    <li> Huge fan of the soap and brush method of shaving. Started with a safety razor earlier this year and I&#x27;ll never go back to disposable razors or cartridge style. I&#x27;ve only used a couple other soaps/creams and this one is the only one that I didn&#x27;t get sick of after a few weeks. It has a nice fresh &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; scent that seems to compliment any other body sprays or colognes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap!!! It smells GREAT, and works even better than it smells. I&#x27;ve completely switched away from the arosol junk, and will be buying this stuff as long as they make it!</li>
    <li> smells good and clean. good foam and beard softening . i am sold on this product. the best i&#x27;ve used so far</li>
    <li> This Van Der Hagen Luxury line of shaving soap in really great. It makes a nice thick rich lather. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This was a good purchase, i love the feeling that the soap leave my feeling. good size last a long time!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know I would enjoy the brush and shave soap as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;One cake will last about 5 months of daily shaving.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything, the only thing else as good is made by L&#x27;Occitane, and one bar is $10.  This product as a nice, subtle smell, lathers up well, great lubricant.  And I have a tough tough beard of black hair.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> I just recently got into older type shaving accessories. This was the first soap I purchased. It lathers well and smells wonderful. Would definitely recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> I just started to shave with this soap and brush a month ago and like it better than the regular foam .Smells great and leaves my face with a smooth clean look.Also more personal shave.Some times I find the old ways of doing things are better.Also I get more shaves with this type of shaving soap.Try it ,You will like it over regular shaving foam. It takes a couple times to learn how much water to use,but it it fun.</li>
    <li> I have always used the most basic, bargain-brand shaving soap with my brush, but this time it was more economical (because of packaging) to get this three-pack, and this is great stuff. Makes the shaving much smoother.</li>
    <li> Nice lather and great smell.  One of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Having gone to Target to buy, I believe, batteries, I noticed the change in Van der Hagen stuff: new soap and a badger brush. While I believe the new brush be a bit on the floppy side, the new soap vastly exceeds in quality the old classical one. Enough glycerine, in particular, makes it truly work, on par with Tabac. Great price, great quality, subdued and nice fragrance makes it a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add that Van Der Hagen has an outstanding customer service (I bought a defective brush from them, emailed about it, and they simply sent a replacement). One more reason to think they care about what stuff they put out there - and the soap is a great illustration of quality.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, when used with all of the products combined (shaving kit)....it worked wonderfully for my son.</li>
    <li> Triple-milled soap (which means it&#x27;ll last a long time, full of good stuff, and leaves your skin feeling smoother than other softer soaps - like the glycerine soaps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the hardcore of the hardcore shaving products (triple milled soaps) - or aka \\&quot;most old-fashioned/traditional way\\&quot;.  It doesn&#x27;t have the big name necessarily (probably b/c this is the brand your local drugstores carry and thus not as \\&quot;boutique\\&quot; or \\&quot;exotic\\&quot;), but this one has everythign you will want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  lathers well, not so hard&lt;br /&gt;2.  smells good... (triple milled soaps typically aren&#x27;t known for their scents).&lt;br /&gt;3.  very nice slickness to it and it DOES NOT dry!!! (that is the downfall of most crèmes and soaps especially).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been on a rampage as a new wet shaver to find somethign that doesn&#x27;t dry so quickly since i shave my head along with my face.  I&#x27;ve done crèmes and soaps of the following variety:  Taylor on Bond Street, Colonel Conk, Williams, Edwin Jagger, Musoreal, and i cna&#x27;t remember the other 1 or 2 i&#x27;ve tried.  Williams, Colonel Conk, and this one were the 3 that kept a nice slick lather without drying out and thus a smooth, comfy shave.  Musoreal is SUPPOSED to be one of the best out there but i haven&#x27;t been able to use it effectively but keep trying since it&#x27;s supposed to up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Williams and Van der Hagen are the triple-milled and they do feel REAL NICE post shave.  Colonel Conk (glycerine) i think is becoming my favorite however as it is really realy super slick and stays moist and smells SO very good (as a glycerine they can carry scent better and have more scent).  Colonel Conk also has a fantastic rep in the industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.. this is how it goes:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Williams for a SUPER CHEAP triple-milled no-nonsense, clean slick shave.  NO bells and whistles.  Motel6 type scent.  This is shaving perfection on pennies.  No container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Van der Hagen for a more luxurious and semi-pampered triple-milled experience with good smelling lather that also lasts.  Pays a bit more but bedause it&#x27;s triple-milled will last you a long time and thus a good value even at the higher price.  Comes with it&#x27;s own plastic self-closing container for easy travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Colonel Conk.  Glycerine soap so it is not as good of value b/c it wno&#x27;t last as long, but much more scent to it and a nice slippery feel to it.  Stays nice and slipper too.  Looks \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; with the translucent colorized soaps.  Comes in a neat plastic self-closing container for travelling as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer these soaps (especially their value and much less cost) over the more expensive crèmes such as Taylor of Bond Street (which is a top-rated crème).  You&#x27;ll feel just as good, for much less, if you&#x27;re okay with the cleaner, more subtle scent over the envigorating scents of crèmes.</li>
    <li> Fits my old shaving mug perfectly. Makes a good lather and does not have a strong scent, which is what I prefer. Didn&#x27;t give it five stars mainly because it took a few shaves to get the lather right--too much water and it&#x27;s way too thin, and after shaking most of the water out, it takes some stirring to get a good lather. For me that&#x27;s ok, if I was looking for instant lather I&#x27;d buy the aerosol stuff. This 3-bar pack will last me a good while and the price is really great compared to what I would pay for just one in a local store.</li>
    <li> Very fairly priced competent soap, one puck will last a whole year even if you shave everyday with 3+ passes! The smell is as pleasant as a car air freshener, it smells a lot like detergents, not bad. But many people will marginalize this soap since it contains the detergent Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)</li>
    <li> As a maker of custom double edge razors and high quality badger shave brushes, I have been on a quest for a couple of years to find a sensibly priced quality shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has included several custom made soaps formulated from my list of preferred ingredients and up to and including the over-priced, over-hyped and under-performing &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; soaps. ANYONE, regardless of available resources, who would pay upwards of $30 for a jar of under-performing perfume soap is a neophyte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of searching and searching, the VDH luxury soap is a refreshing find. Natural ingredients, VERY LIGHTLY scented (meaning FEWER chemicals to irritate sensitive skin). The is one of the very best glycerin based soaps I&#x27;ve found, AT ANY PRICE. It DOES NOT perform quite as nicely as the true tallow based soaps, but one of the best glycerine based soaps available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van Der Hagen performs every bit as well as an &amp;#34;industry standard&amp;#34; Col. Conk Bay Rum. At $8 for a 2.5 oz bar of Conk and $4 for the VDH. The Hagen is a distant winner in my book. As with ANY glycerine soap, a badger brush is essential (a perhaps the reason VDH sells a badger brush with their product rather than a hog/bristle brush). Additionally, as with ANY glycerine soap, knowing the hardness of the water is essential for knowing how to make a rich, slick lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick and simple water quality test is a simple aquarium test strip. One quick dip of the test strip gives adequate information to determine soap to water ratios.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In independent testing, the VDH performed similarly to or better than most of the hyped &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you insist on tossing away perfectly good money on &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; soaps, consider Shea Moisture African Black Soap. This IS a natural &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; and weighs in at about $10 per container. The African Black also outperforms the over priced &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; shave soaps, but will not produce the &amp;#34;slickness&amp;#34; of the VDH or Col. Conk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this reviewer opinion, the VDH luxury shave soap is a best buy.</li>
    <li> I got my first batch of Van Der Hagen soap with a full kit that I had bought about a year ago. That one bar of soap lasted me that whole year. My girlfriend loves every time I shave because of the smell of this soap. I dont personally think it smells very strong at all, but she can pick it up a mile away on me. Not only does it smell good for the ladies, it lathers up very well even in hard water and provides a nice smooth surface for shaving. I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of soaps -but keep coming back to this. Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you, this is a top notch shaving soap.  The only slight criticism I have is the scent -it&#x27;s not my favorite, and it would be nice to have another choice.  Regardless, 5 stars for the soap and 5 stars for value.</li>
    <li> Great soap I use it for my body as well as my shaving</li>
    <li> Good, bought it again</li>
    <li> Very good shaving soap at a nominal price. Looks like these are going to last for quite a while. Subtle smell with good moisturizing foam. Works well for me.</li>
    <li> Nice aroma, and geed lather</li>
    <li> I just started using a safety razor and have been trying new products to up the experience. The best thing this product has going for it is it&#x27;s fragrance and ability to make a quality lather with very little effort; however, I found my razor skipping and not getting a slick, easy glide on my stubble. This led to several small nicks and having to use more lather than with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I had finished shaving, despite copious amounts of moistening after-shave balm, my face feels very dried out and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tailor of Bond Street products are vastly superior. NOT RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> This stuff is just surprisingly awesome. I got a bar if this included in my shaving kit, and have been using this stuff ever since as my regular shaving soap. It performs way better than I even expected, I am just beyond impressed with how much of a bargain this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this stuff is amazingly inexpensive. At my local Walgreens it is $3.99 / bar. This builds an incredibly thick and luxurious lather, and the scent is great. This is truly my day to day shaving soap. The scent is a very nice fresh scent, I am not sure how to describe it other than that. It is very nice. It makes my skin nice and soft too. The first brush I used was the cheap Van Der Hagen one that came in the set, and that performed OK, but when I tried this soap with a better brush, HOLY MOLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One trick I learned is to not only wet and shake off the brush, but also wet the bar before building a lather. Adding that little extra step made this perform even better. I have tried a few high end creams too that I bought, and for the cost you really can&#x27;t beat this stuff. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, go to a local Target, Walmart, Walgreens, whatever and buy a single bar and try it....you&#x27;ll only be out $4 and I am sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed. All things considered I am not going to buy other more expensive products anymore...I am going to stick to this due to its low cost, high performance and local availability.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite shaving soaps. As good or better than the fancy creams and soaps from UK and Italy but a quarter the price. Puck lasts a long time. Good cushion, glide, scent and aftercare. Hope I live long enough to go through all three.</li>
    <li> That was in reference to someone&#x27;s review that I read that enticed me to try this soap.  Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, this soap smells wonderful.  I wish the scent lasted longer than it does.  I used to use a triple milled soap which last forever and was skeptical of switching to the softer glycerin type.  I may never go back.  The lather that you get with this is far superior compared to the triple milled soaps I&#x27;ve tried.  The quality of shave has improved as well since I have switched.  I highly recommend this soap to anyone looking to switch.</li>
    <li> Great shave soap. Lathers super well. Also the fragrance is intoxicating. I really wish they made this fragrance into a cologne-- it smells absolutely fantastic</li>
    <li> I enjoy the smell these have, and they build up a good lather quickly. They last quite a long time as well. I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for about 3 years now and I&#x27;m just now finishing my 2nd puck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used two shaving soaps to date but I love this one. I&#x27;ve bought this pack twice and will purchase it again when I run out. I use it when shaving my legs on a daily basis. Gets a great lather with a good shaving brush and each soap lasts about a month.</li>
    <li> Nice price point for the quality of the product. Smells great (not too strong), easily whips up a great lather, and lasts a long time. Feels great on the skin. I was impressed at the quality relative to the cost, honestly. I&#x27;ll use these as my go-to shave soap for now on.</li>
    <li> First time wet shaving. This shave soap works great. Lathers well and smells good too. I shave every day and it seem to be lasting quite long too.</li>
    <li> I just started using this a few months ago after years of using the regulars like Williams, Col Conk, Berma etc.  It&#x27;s got a slight scent and lathers up very easily, and shaves even nicer.  They are larger than most shave soaps, and so far mine barely looks used after a couple months of use.  So far, so good.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is a little overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great deal and makes a decent lather for everyday shaving. Does not irritate the skin at all. I used to get extremely bad razor burn, but since switching to a safety razor and this shaving soap, it has receded. You can&#x27;t beat this product or deal.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap for before and after razor shave. Smells awesome too.</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving about 7 months ago and this is the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve found.  Smells great. Smooth, great lather.  Leaves skin feeling super smooth.</li>
    <li> For an expensive soap, this is really nice.  I like the subtle slightly floral smell (although my wife wasn&#x27;t crazy about it).  It also moisturizes well.  I used one puck and went back to Proraso green.  The Proraso feels like it dries my face out tremendously now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is possible to achieve a thick rich lather with this but it takes more effort than, say, Proraso does.  After soaking, loading the brush, and generally being disappointed, I just tossed the puck a bowl.  I get a good lather that way but the puck didn&#x27;t last as long.  The last couple weeks the puck was mush (or maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong?).  I had maybe a month and a half out of one puck.  I shave daily.  Sometimes, I might shave twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was after a cheap soap again, I might grab more VDH but if I can help it, I&#x27;ll shoot for Proraso or maybe Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
    <li> Best shave soap I have found at a reasonable price. It smells good to.</li>
    <li> I got these as replacement soaps for the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury Shave Set (http://www.amazon.com/Van-Hagen-Mens-Luxury-Shave/dp/B004L4EING/r) and still love the kit. It smells great, makes thick lather, and lasts a long time, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This makes my boyfriend smell great!</li>
    <li> This soap has an extremely pleasing scent, so much so that I would love to shower with it. I do not like the shaving experience with it compared to my Col. Conks Bay Rum. It does not lather as thickly, is not as slick, and has to be reapplied for even buffing and touch-up passes. The first pass with it is ok, but by pass two and three it has cleaned my skin of the PSO and is no longer that slick. The Conks stays slippery and smooth for every pass. However, about every 3-4 shaves I go back to this simply because of the scent. I may end up melting it back out of my shave mug and into a mold to shower with.</li>
    <li> Great soap that lathers and foams well. The scent is is amazing and I highly recommend for any man&#x27;s shaving kit. I had no burning or skin problems with the multiple uses. I only think Van Der Hagen could design a better container for the soap. To my surprise, It&#x27;s a great gift which is actually a pack of three. You can even use it as a body soap.</li>
    <li> This brand is my favorite out the 3 brands I have tried. It smells the best and foams up easily.</li>
    <li> best shipping so for my needs. Still using it love it</li>
    <li> Easy lathering and great for sensitive skin. I expect to get a bit more than two months out of a single cake, with daily use.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this shaving soap. It creates a much nicer lather and smells better than many of its higher end competitors. The scent is second to none.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son and he loves it! He had purchased all his brothers sets for them last Christmas Day.</li>
    <li> I have become a huge fan of shaving soap over the last few years.  And this soap is top notch.  Great lather, great scent, great shave!</li>
    <li> With the cost of this 3 pack, I can get nearly a year out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s shaving soap, can&#x27;t ask much out of it.</li>
    <li> I prefer other soaps. This soap is very nice smelling if you like a very &#x27;clean&#x27; smell. Doesn&#x27;t leave a lasting scent, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. The lather is easy to make, and you can&#x27;t be disappointed by the price.</li>
    <li> I take the tub out and rub it on my wet face against the grain.  I then hand remove the lather and apply shaving soap or cream over the Van Der Hagen.  It offers a real slick base and a very smooth shave.  Great pre shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap a while back but put it away once I got some more well known soaps. These other soaps irritated my skin on the second pass. I&#x27;m assuming whatever is in them I&#x27;m sensitive to. I don&#x27;t have this problem with this soap. I let the soap soak while I shower, soak my brush for about 5 minutes and swirl it up. I build my lather on my face and this does a great job. A cut every now and then but nothing I haven&#x27;t experienced before. Leaves my skin soft and the smell isn&#x27;t too strong for my liking.</li>
    <li> I use a boar-hair brush with this, and I found that it took more soap to lather than the ordinary Van Der Hagen soap.  The aroma is really great, however; like sweet whipped heavy cream.</li>
    <li> Not very protective. Just another version of Van Der Hagen&#x27;s chemical-laden product, which wouldn&#x27;t even &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; without the addition of sodium laural sulfate. If it works for you, fine. But it really isn&#x27;t a very good product.</li>
    <li> My husband is new to the shaving soap experience and he loves this shaving soap! Great lather, nice subtle fragrance, and long lasting. We will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> After years of using canned shaving cream the wet shaving bug has bitten me hard. The resulting quest for equipment and other goodies has led me to some wonderful discoveries....and Van Der Hagen luxury soap ranks pretty near the top of my go-to list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the scent of this soap is delightful. It has nearly ruined me from using my other soaps (bay rum, almond, Bigelow, etc) and I find that I reach for it more than the others based on scent alone. Nothing really feminine about the aroma but delicate and fresh in a manly sort of way. Similar to a high end cologne but more subdued...light and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, lathering this soap is quite easy with a badger brush and mug. I have found that it takes very little time to create enough lather for a multiple pass shave with a Tweezerman badger brush or my Van Der Hagen badger brush. Either one takes the soap well and whips up a great lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, once lathered, one notices the slickness of the shave right off the bat. I use a pre-shave oil and can sometimes skip that step with VDH luxury. It&#x27;s that slick. Very nice for that BBS closeness that most wet shavers chase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, the price. Three pucks for about ten bucks? Insanely good deal. I purchased mine in a Target locally and their price point was just shy of four dollars a puck. Even at that price it is a stellar deal for a soap of this quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several soaps and keep coming back to VDH luxury. It&#x27;s the kind of product that if production of it halted (shudder the thought), I&#x27;d go on a quest to find as many as I could to build up a stock for future shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards.</li>
    <li> This is a great value. It lathers extremely well, has a pleasant scent, and is very gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this soap.  Smells great, and one bar lasted about eight months of shaving my head every-other day.</li>
    <li> Best shave soap...good lather...good smell</li>
    <li> I think this is the best shaving soap that I have tried. I really like the thick lather and the smell.</li>
    <li> Would buy this again for my boyfriend.  He likes it a lot.  It&#x27;s great for shaving in the hot  shower.</li>
    <li> The soap performs very well. It lathers easily and is pretty slick. I got my best results with it by being generous with water. My one detraction to make is that the scent, while more masculine to me than ordinary Van der Hagen, is far too subtle. I barely register it. This may be a plus for some, though.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a christmas gift for my brother. He absolutely loved them :) Great gift idea for any man in your life.</li>
    <li> Lathers really nicely, and seems to last forever. I bought a three pack and it seems I will have them for over a year as one bar so far has lasted over 9 months and I&#x27;m not even 1/2 through it.&lt;br /&gt;Provides rich lather and not irritating. The scent is very mild, pleasant and pretty much unremarkable. Not looking for perfumey shave soap anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend, and for under $5 a bar, they last a very long time</li>
    <li> I, the husband, did not enjoy shaving with this particular soap. It does not lather well and I find my razor doesn&#x27;t easily glide across my face. Van Der Hagen has some good shaving soaps, but this one, I can not recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the way it lathers, I still prefer the mug and brush system for shaving</li>
    <li> BEST SHAVING MUG SOAP I HAVE USED. HAS A GREAT SCENT ALSO</li>
    <li> When I first tried this shaving soap, I was a little disappointed. It has a nice scent, but I wasn&#x27;t getting the lather that I expected. After a little trial and error, I discovered that if you put a little hot water on the soap for a minute or so while you&#x27;re washing your face and wetting your brush, and then pour out the water, about thirty seconds of swirling motion with the brush will get it loaded with soap. Work the brush directly on your face and you&#x27;ll get a very rich, creamy lather in no time. This soap is very economical. I bought the three pack and am still using the last of the first bar six months later. A great choice!</li>
    <li> Having switched to this from the Van Der Hagen \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; soap, let me tell you what an unbelievable difference there is between the two products. Both work great for shaving, both make a great lather, but the Luxury stuff is like aromatherapy in the morning. The smell is very relaxing and meditative, a quality that is lacking in the deluxe soap. I&#x27;m a cheap bastard most of the time, but the extra dollar a bar is well worth it in this case. Either way, it&#x27;s still cheaper than the junk out of a can.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different soaps, and I have to say that the Van der Hagen soap is the best for me. I don&#x27;t have heavy facial hair and sensitive skin, so this soap is ideal.  It gives a nice lather and lasts through my shave. Even with going back over my tough to shave spots, I don&#x27;t get nicks or razor burn. The 3 pack makes this a great value and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I hate to be the one to damage such a good review, but to be fair I must:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a rather large (old) shaving mug that I&#x27;ve had for more years than I&#x27;d care to count. In recent years I&#x27;ve been unable to find shave soap that would fill the bottom of my mug (disk 3 to 3.5 inches were common in Europe, but for the past several years I&#x27;ve not found them anywhere). The only shave soap I could find would be the 2 to 2.5 inch disk poured into a plastic cup of sorts for a dollar in the Base Exchange. These small \\&quot;cups\\&quot; of soap make a great lather, but the soap moves around in my mug too much.&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my delight when I discovered the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury Scented Soap on Amazon. $5 a disk seemed a bit steep, but the picture showed a disk, not the \\&quot;soap in a cup\\&quot;, then I read the Product Dimensions: 1.2 x 3.5 x 3.5 inches; 4.5 ounces and I was ecstatic! At last, I had found a 3.5 inch \\&quot;disk\\&quot; for my large shaving mug. I figured to get what I wanted I&#x27;d be willing to pay more. Five times as much seems a bit much, but I figured hey you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, alas, my elation lasted a very short time after opening my package. What I received was not what was advertised. It is not a \\&quot;disk\\&quot;! And even worse it&#x27;s only 2.5 inches across!! NOT the 3.5 as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I am very disappointed! In this case I feel like I did NOT \\&quot;get what I paid for\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $5.00 a \\&quot;cup\\&quot; it had better make an excellent lather!</li>
    <li> I got into wet shaving several months ago and I got some of this soap in a kit that came with a mug a brush, a stand and a straight razor. The razor sucked and I tossed it but the best part was the soap! It drove my wife wild so I had to order more! Not sure what scent this is but it smells pleasant without being overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Do not pay more for soap as this produces a very good lather that is slick and protective. Low cost and high performance make this a superior buy.</li>
    <li> The smell is great I wish it would get morelublubricant</li>
    <li> I tried this excellent shave soap on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised. It lathers well, even in hard water, and provides both cushioning and slickness without drying out too quickly on the face. It has a faint but pleasant aroma that fades fairly quickly after shaving. Basically, this soap is a solid performer at a reasonable price. It has earned a permanent spot in my rotation.</li>
    <li> Makes a good lather and leaves the face feeling really good after shaving. HINT: Shave after a shower and let the lather set for at least a minute before shaving. Quite the difference between this and cold shave creme or cold shave gel.</li>
    <li> This particular soap is the first one that I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve used many brands of the canned stuff.  Van Der Hagen&#x27;s Luxury is by far superior!  It takes a little practice to get the right water balance required for a good lather, but once you get the hang of it, the lather will just happen.  Over all, the soap provides a good amount of lubrication, protects from nicks and rinses very easy.  The scent is fairly feint, but nice.  I plan to try other brands, but at the moment, I can see myself coming back to this one, as the price-performance ratio seems to be very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update 2/10/14***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve tried Col. Conk&#x27;s, the Van Der Hagen and Parker&#x27;s Sandalwood soaps.  I would have to say that the VDH leads the pack.  At first blush, the Parker seems like it lathers easier, but it&#x27;s really hard to get a nice, dense foam.  Col. Conk&#x27;s has a great lather, but feels like it leaves a residue on my face (we have very soft water here in Detroit.)  The VDH soap would be the way to go if you&#x27;re really trying to save money, as it is a nice product over all.  I raised my rating from 4 to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This puck is an outstanding value. It has a light masculine fragrance and lathers well after about 30-45 seconds of loading. It works going straight from brush to the face or to another bowl for further lathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I let most water run out of a brush, (just until the running stops), then swirl-load it for 45 seconds, then transfer to a textured bowl adding a couple of drops of water and swirl for 45 seconds more, then I have the most luxurious lather imaginable -- and plenty for 3 + passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.</li>
    <li> After receiving this Luxury Soap from ChandaStuff, I was knocked out by the delicious fragrance and elegant packaging. As a gift for anyone who lathers up with a traditional brush, it&#x27;s perfect; an inexpensive product with a rich look and scent. After contacting the seller by phone with some questions, I was struck by his attention to detail, as well as his sense of courtesy and open honesty. That alone makes ChandaStuff worth doing business with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding customer service, and a nice range of quality products. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> If you have allergies or sensitivities to smells, this product may be for you. I get a headache from overly scented soaps/creams (can&#x27;t use proraso for example) and this soap does not give me any issues. The smell is fantastic, I sometimes just take a whiff of it if I&#x27;m in the bathroom because the smell is that good (and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on your face like some other products). Takes some practice to get a good lather, but it creates nice lather when you get the hang of it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the value!</li>
    <li> I finally got around to using this particular Van Der Hagen Shave Soap.  Overall I really like this soap just a little better than their Deluxe Shave Soap.  Not by much but slightly.  Here is why.&lt;br /&gt;  Both are made by Van Der Hagen.  The Luxury has a better scent to it.  It allows a slightly better shave to it.  And it comes in 3.5 ounce pucks.&lt;br /&gt;  The reasons why I like it moderately better are that while I LOVE the above, it is almost $2 more than the Deluxe &amp; the Lather is not as good as the Deluxe.  But all things being equal, the Van Der Hagen Luxury Shave Soap is definately the better out of the two.  But either way you can&#x27;t lose with either Shave Soap.</li>
    <li> Yep, this is the keeper.  My new preference over the Colonel.  Good price, good lather, doesn&#x27;t seem like it is deteriorating as quickly as the conk stuff either.</li>
    <li> I enjoy shaving with this.</li>
    <li> The scent is a powerful, synthetic-smelling floral scent that lingers in my nose long after I&#x27;ve shaved.  It makes me sneeze and my skin turns red after I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not allergic to it, this is probably OK, but if you have sensitive skin, stay away from this.</li>
    <li> This soap makes a great lather and makes it very quickly. Its a better shave soap than some of the more expensive brands. The wife got me the VDH Luxury Set for my birthday and I went right to target and picked up two more pucks of this soap. I also use creams but that is another realm completely. You can spend more and get less and this is the best soap for the money.</li>
    <li> I can never get this soap to lather up.  No matter what I try or how long and hard I whisk it, only \\&quot;face soap\\&quot; kind of lather.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
    <li> The soaps were perfect! They came at a right time!</li>
    <li> This soap is great and will last you a long time. I am a big fan of the scent and the quick lather. I recent switched from traditional shaving cream/gel to a badger and soap. I do not regret that decision at all. This really softens up the whiskers for a nice, clean cut. It also leaves my face feeling smooth without the razor burn. I shave 3-4 times a week, and am still on my original soap bar. I would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade their shaving experience.</li>
    <li> best smelling and most luxurious shave I ever had</li>
    <li> A+ very fast shipping &amp; good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over year. It is of high quality and the fragrance is subtle and clean (masculine). It lathers well and the consistency of the lather can be built up to your liking by soaking more water into your brush to get it lighter or thicker with less water.</li>
    <li> Great soap, best shave I had in a long time and I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Its a little bit sensitive to the water quantity. Too much water, and the soap seems to thin.  Too little, and it doesn&#x27;t perform right.  If you get the ratio correct, however, it performs quite nicely.  I should mention that I use the \\&quot;face lathering\\&quot; method. It&#x27;s not super slick, but it&#x27;s a great performer, and the soap goes a long way.  A great product and a terrific value.</li>
    <li> The scent is very clean but not overpowering. laters up pretty well too. purchased as a gift formy boyfriend and he like it as well.</li>
    <li> This soap leaves my skin soft and clean lightly accented.  Very masculine scent and luxurious. I honestly don&#x27;t know how they can sell ity so inexpensively!!!  I like this soap I bought 6 more to be sure I don&#x27;t run out and I give them to friends because I want then all Rio know about this soap!</li>
    <li> This shave soap is easy to lather, applies smooth and helps me get a great shave. Plus you get three in the pack for a great value. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Face feels nice and clean! Really like this product.</li>
    <li> Nice feel, spreads well, Cheeks feel good, I don&#x27;t feel any residual soap after rinsing. Can give it as  gifts to friends- three 3 bars</li>
    <li> The gentle scent provides a nice backup to my aftershave.  I believe my shaves are actually closer using this soap than with canned spray foam.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to DE razor wet shaving and got this as part of the [[ASIN:B004L4EING Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set]].  It&#x27;s a generous chunk of soap, and I estimate it&#x27;ll last me at least 6 months.  It lathers rich and fully, and goes on quite well with the inexpensive brush they provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, all of that pales in comparison to the smell.  The smell is amazing.  I&#x27;d wear it as a cologne if it were available.  It&#x27;s subtle, warm, masculine, rich, and lingering.  It&#x27;s not overpowering in the least, but it&#x27;s always there.  I never actually smell it unless a small breeze moves under my nose, or I move through space.  It reminds me of being a man, and I find myself grabbing the mug it sits in, or the brush I use whenever I&#x27;m in the bathroom and smelling it.  Sometimes I go to the bathroom on non-shave days just to smell it.  I&#x27;ve even lathered my face on a non-shave day (every other day) just for the scent.  It&#x27;s intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But because I&#x27;m new to this whole thing, I decided it would be wise to invest in some more expensive, luxury soap brands, time tested and bulwark through the ages.  [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B000C0PAR6 Geo F. Trumper Violet Shaving Soap Refill]].  I figured, well if this is a cheap puck from a Dutch brand, the \\&quot;real\\&quot; stuff from England must be phenomenal!  I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.  They stink.  They stink to high heaven, and I wouldn&#x27;t put them anywhere near my skin.  They stink of old people, and remind me of nursing homes.  Furthermore, they don&#x27;t smell anything like sandalwood or violets. Returned just as soon as they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I find myself faithfully buying 3 more pucks of this alluring, seductively scented masculine soap nary before my current puck has budged an inch in its mug, because I like to be reminded of what it&#x27;s like to be a man.</li>
    <li> These are actually quite nice!  They have a pleasant scent and make a very nice creamy rich lather.  I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as other more expensive soaps but it does give a very good shave. The aroma of the soap is also very nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used expensive shave soaps, but both my husband and I use this (him for his face, and me for my legs). We like the mild scent as well as the smooth, rich lather when worked up right with a badger brush. It brushes on nicely and is much better than an aerosol cream as far as getting a good shave goes.</li>
