    <li> His wife loved the nail polish, definately lasts a week.  The color is pretty for summer.  Better than OPI!</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the color</li>
    <li> Non returnable even if not used.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t shopped too much at Amazon in the past,, but I love the fact that I find whatever I am looking for on your site.. Thanks for making my life so simple. Will definitely shop with you in the future...</li>
    <li> great color and stays for at least 5-6 days for me</li>
    <li> Did not last a week. Day two started seeing peeling. No different than regular nail polish. Did like the color.</li>
    <li> This is a medium shade of pink. Lasts about 5 to 6 days on my fingernails and 5 weeks or more on my toenails.</li>
    <li> Love CND Vinylux as it drys quickly and I love the fall colors.  BUT, need to use acetone to remove.  I wrap each nail with a small bit of cotton dipped in remover and cover with alum. foil.  Leave on for 5-8 minutes and the polish will be easier to remove completely.  Or, take to your local salon and let the nail tech deal with it.  I&#x27;m retired so don&#x27;t mind doing myself.</li>
    <li> I love pink polish. I wore it for about 4 or 5 days with no chipping even with no top coat. I just got top coat but haven&#x27;t tried it yet. I also placed an order for 2 more bottles.</li>
    <li> Loved the color and the order arrived as stated and in good condition.  Would use this seller again.  This is the best polish you can find and it last for a week without chipping. Just Love it!!</li>
    <li> I used to spend $3 extra when I got a professional manicure for this nail polish.  Now I do it at home.  This polish will last for at least a week if you use the base and top coat also.</li>
    <li> The best ever nail polish. Stays as long as gel but easy to apply and remove at home. Highly recommend Vinylux.</li>
    <li> This is a great hot pink for Spring and Summer. It lasted about 5 or 6 days before requiring a new application.</li>
    <li> Stayed on for two weeks! I&#x27;d like a brighter, more current color but otherwise, I would highly recommend.  Does not come off with the usual polish remover; I had to use tools to buff it off</li>
    <li> Great color, perfect for summer, and it really does last a week compared to the 2-3 day I get from regular polish.</li>
    <li> This Pink is a bright Pink, which is why I love it. Two colors and the Top Coat and it stays for a week.</li>
    <li> Used with orly rubberized base coat and vinylux top coat, and my mani lasted for 10 days with only a little tip wear!</li>
    <li> This product dries up quickly! However since im a mom and spend time in the kitchen regularly, it doesn&#x27;t last up to 7 days. Good thing is, u don&#x27;t need UV lamp drying process and taking it off is also quick.</li>
    <li> Lasted longer than I hoped a full 5 days.  Easy to remove with standard nai polish remover.</li>
    <li> It is easy to apply. It is easy to remove. It stays on your nails much longer than regular nail polish. It&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Best pink ever!! It&#x27;s like bubble gum pink. Just perfect!</li>
    <li> This polish is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Love it and the color is great!</li>
    <li> just reordering already loved it</li>
    <li> I like this polish better than OPI.  It seems to last longer.  Not too hard to remove after wearing for a week.</li>
    <li> Picture the color of pink cotton candy when it is wet and this is the color of Hot Pop Pink. I have it on my toes now and love it!! The bright pinks &amp; corals are my go to summer favs and this one is added to the collection. Fast drying too. Well packaged and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great color, price and product.</li>
    <li> I love the color and the quality of the polish.  It stays on long without peeling and chipping.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff.  Add a sparkle top coat and it really lasts and lasts.</li>
    <li> Have used this product&lt;br /&gt;Before. When applied w the top coat, it is excellent. My pedi lasts for 2-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> color pretty, wears for a week or longer</li>
    <li> not the correct color</li>
    <li> Polish is long lasting as described. Very nice color choices as well. Dries very quickly too! Overall a great product. Will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> The quality is great. They are solid and thick, but the color is not as the pic, I didn&#x27;t like the color</li>
    <li> Dried fast stayed on for a week with no chips! A little hard to remove but not to bad :-)</li>
    <li> This color is a bright pink, true to the photos. It goes on easily, dries quickly (with the top coat it dries in about 10 minutes), and lasts a whole week!</li>
    <li> This one doesn&#x27;t lump as bad as the other colors I purchased.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be used on bare nails, then with the CND Vinylux top coat.  This color does stain your nails, yet doesn&#x27;t work as well if you use a base coat.  This color cannot be used alone; it will easily scratch off (as though it were still wet).  With the topcoat, I got 2-3 full days of wear before it began chipping (the company says it should be a week before chipping).</li>
    <li> Perfect pink color right now as it&#x27;s in fashion for the upcoming summer. It lasted about 6 days for me.</li>
    <li> As described. Last longer than normal nail polish. Easy to remove.</li>
    <li> Great color for the summer.  Polish lasted a week.  I&#x27;m going to definitely try other colors.</li>
    <li> Excellent product !!!</li>
    <li> My nail polish chips the next day every time I wear this. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish! It stays on your nails so much longer then any other brand! No base coat and it doesn&#x27;t chip for at least a week.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of polish! I love the colors and the fact that it lasts a long time without chipping! The top coat also helps it to dry really fast saving me lots of time!</li>
    <li> Wish it did better, but i get chipping in a day or two.  Doesn&#x27;t last any longer than a regular polish for me.</li>
    <li> Great polish that really lasts with very minimal chipping.  I love it!  I am going to try more colors.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy :-)</li>
    <li> Super price! Terrific product.</li>
    <li> The product I received is not the product I order. Very disappointed.  I received a generic unmarked bottle. The color on the bottom is venom 152n  would not order again and would advise others not to as well.</li>
    <li> Very pretty bright bubblegum pink polish! Lasts 2 weeks! The only negative about this polish is that you need 3 even coats of polish to cover!</li>
    <li> Did not last but two days</li>
    <li> One of my favorite vinylux colors! It&#x27;s the perfect bubblegum pink with no sparkles or shimmer effect! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful polish. My manicurist starting using this on me, bless her.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the quality and durability of this product. Someone had a superb idea making polish with vinyl in it. It really does last a week (at the very least) and it rarely ever chips. Mine did chip a couple of days after I&#x27;d been doing some fairly heavy cleaning, but that&#x27;s nothing compared to the usual nail polish. I&#x27;m getting lots of colors of this polish. So far, I like them all.</li>
    <li> This CNd Polish is great !!!</li>
