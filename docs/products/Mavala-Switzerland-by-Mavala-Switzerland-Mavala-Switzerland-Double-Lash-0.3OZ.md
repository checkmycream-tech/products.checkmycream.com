      <li>and I love the results I&#x27;m getting from that.</li>

      <li>I can already tell that this is doing something, which is more than the L&#x27;oreal.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THIS COMPANY AND THEIR PRODUCTS ROCK...</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>After using this product for two months, I have noticed that my lashes have gotten much more fuller.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re healthy and I don&#x27;t care how it looks.   </li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;ve started using it regularly,I expect to see more results.     </li>
      <li>I hope to see more results as the weeks go by.  </li>
      <li>Maybe in another week or two the change will be more noticeable.</li>
      <li>overall it is a great product for the price!!!</li>
      <li>They seem to make pretty good stuff there.  </li>
      <li>I ordered more of this product, so I am happy with it enough to continue with it.</li>
      <li>My order arrived very quickly and I have been using it every evening after cleansing mascara off my eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product but caution it can take awhile to make a truly noticeable difference to people with fine, sparse lashes.</li>
      <li>I started researching amazon to see if there was a magic quick cure.  </li>
      <li>and I notice a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>and I have seen a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I was told not to try and take them out on my own or I would pull my real lashes out.  </li>
      <li>Before this type of mascara was available</li>
      <li>The fact that I am now using a great product to stop drying out my lashes is a big benefit.  </li>
      <li>its only been 3 days and the stuff actualy works, i useualy use dream lash and this stuff is just as good and in some ways better</li>
      <li>It took about 6-8 weeks for me to notice any significant difference</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not expensive and you may find you&#x27;re satisfied with the results you get.  </li>
      <li>The results are worth it!</li>
      <li>All I can say is that I feel pretty again :)</li>
      <li>I just started this product a week ago, and I can see already significant improvement in the length of my lashes.</li>
      <li>I even tried not using mascara for 6 months with the exception of  3-4 times for special occasions.  </li>
      <li>I was very sceptical about most of the products I was reading about</li>
      <li>So I came across Mavala Double Lash and thought the price was good</li>
      <li>Well to start off I would like to say that anyone who wants their eyelashes to grow for a cheap price should definitley use this!  </li>
      <li>It made my lashes thicker rather quickly</li>
      <li>It worked so well and so quick.</li>
      <li>definitely hoping that i will notice more changes after a couple more weeks.</li>
      <li>New lashes were growing on my bottom lash line, and my top lashes seemed to be getting longer.</li>
      <li>I have to be patient and give it a little more time, but I am happy with the results I have seen so far.</li>
      <li>I would say that it is definitely worth trying b4</li>
      <li>worth trying.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the value/results so far.  </li>
      <li>made me smile.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m not crazy about the odor.  </li>
      <li>Well, I made the mistake of trying and they were right......</li>
      <li>you have very long lashes on your own without salons.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if I use it for a few more months it will even grow longer.</li>
      <li>If you would sacrifice everything for your lashes to grow try vit A+D cream,rub a little ( on the roots of the lashes, just don&#x27;t get it into your eyes) and you re good to go.</li>
      <li>so thought  I would try this one first.  </li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it says.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting married in June</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to use RapidLash and Latisse because of the side effects; Double Lash was my healthy alternative.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I used it on my brows for the first week and then decided it was probably safe to use on my eyelashes, which I&#x27;ve been doing for the last six weeks.  </li>
      <li>was quite sure I gave it 3 weeks to 1 month before I stopped, but uh... mu lashes look exactly the same -__-</li>
      <li>This product really does work!  </li>
      <li>That would make more sense than starting with both as I did.  </li>
      <li>I first tried RapidLash which advertises itself as a lash growth product.  </li>
      <li>no dramatic change in lashes.</li>
      <li>I will certainly purchase this product again.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the other products that have higher prices would work better though.</li>
      <li>The product did work for me, although not as much as I imagined.</li>
      <li>DIDN&#x27;T WORK VERY WELL</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a month, and I really notice the difference.</li>
      <li>I always use Almay  eye makeup remover pads for waterproof mascara or baby  oil to gently remove mascara.</li>
      <li>They did, but not that much.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s kinda greasy, thou really works.    </li>
      <li>and I already have much much fuller longer lashes.</li>
      <li>and you end up wasting too much of it.</li>
      <li>I wonder who really writes their reviews and testamonials?</li>
      <li>I always used eye cream at night then and thought just doing that made my eyelashes much longer.   </li>
      <li>and I guarantee your lashes will look much longer and thicker.</li>
      <li>Good product that works, but give it at least two months to really see a difference normally.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say my eyelashes look any different to anybody other than me, but I do think there is more thickness, especially along the bottom where my eyelashes were very light and sparse.  </li>
      <li>ardell works better &amp; costs less.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product and have used you it on actresses who have NO lashes and can&#x27;t believe the results...</li>

    <li> I been using mavala for 2 months, no results in longer, but they feel softer.</li>
    <li> this product helped a lot to make my eyelashes become longer and thicker.Also I have used it for eyebrows,and it helps a lot to fill in between.strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> i have used it for 2 weeks and notice the lashes are longer but not sure if they are fuller. overall it is a great product for the price!!!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says.  Lashes grow long and thick, just great.</li>
    <li> I used this for 4 months and it didnt do as it said it would. The only thing it did do was make them softer. I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> late in delivery, but so far awaiting to meet my expectations in 30 days period.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 3 weeks and it works!! my lashes are longer.....</li>
    <li> DIDN&#x27;T WORK VERY WELL</li>
    <li> I first tried RapidLash which advertises itself as a lash growth product.  I read the ingredient list and RapidLash is actually a conditioner just like Mavala Double Lash.  RapidLash, however, is more than twice as expensive.  I returned the RapidLash and purchased Mavala Double Lash.  After one month, my lashes are longer and thicker.  The conditioner in this product makes your lahes stronger which prevents them from breaking and allows them to grow.  I was having problems with lash breakage and my lashes falling out.  Not now.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month, and I really notice the difference.</li>
    <li> Hi! Well to start off I would like to say that anyone who wants their eyelashes to grow for a cheap price should definitley use this!  I have baby eyelashes and it&#x27;s very hard to feel pretty with such short eyelashes. I started the treatment in my eyelases on august 29th and it hasn&#x27;t even been a month and I already have much much fuller longer lashes. I&#x27;m sure if I use it for a few more months it will even grow longer. I truly recommend this. Please don&#x27;t waste [...] bucks on any other item because this is affordable and it works just a well. It did not leave a mess. It&#x27;s very easy. And I had NO allergic reaction. Please order this. It&#x27;s great!  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the expensive \\&quot;Brooke Shields\\&quot; brand but it is so expensive so thought  I would try this one first.  After a few weeks I have noticed that my eyelashes are longer and it seems my eyebrows are a tiny bit thicker. As a teenager I had the second longest lashes in my high school class. I always used eye cream at night then and thought just doing that made my eyelashes much longer.   As I got older (50&#x27;s) they became less so. They are also blonde, which does not help!  They are still not exactly like they use to be but are definitely longer than most people I have seen.  I always use an eyelash curler on bare lashes as close to the base of my eyelashes as I can get and squeeze for 20 seconds,(Never use an eyelash curler with mascara on your eyelashes as it will break them off), then I use  Loreal black mascara (Loreal Volume Shocking Waterproof) which has the white base coat to put on first, then the mascara.  Before this type of mascara was available I always dusted my lashes with face powder before putting on mascara.   I always use Almay  eye makeup remover pads for waterproof mascara or baby  oil to gently remove mascara. Let it set then carefully remove without pulling on lashes.  Never sleep in your mascara as that also breaks your lashes off.  Follow these steps and I guarantee your lashes will look much longer and thicker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week religiously using a generous amount in the morning before i put on mascara and before I goto sleep. I naturally have really long eyelashes, and I like them so I thought this would help to keep them healthy. Ive already seen results, they have grown, they are stronger and they definitely look healthier.. I use this and extra virgin olive oil to gently wash off the waterproof eyeliner and mascara off.. I shake the bottle and make sure its on the wand and start at the root of my eyelashes, also this product has helped my eyebrows grow quicker.. as I accidentally overplucked them &#x3D;(   I absolutely love this product and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a month ago, and BOY does it work. After the first week I started noticing little eyelashes growing out of my tear ducts, and had to tweeze them. That hurt like the Dickens. Then, I had eyelashes galore, not to mention they were thicker and blacker than the devil. If you are considering boosting your lashes, buy this product. No, buy two of them.. they make great stocking stuffers. I gave one to my father last Thanksgiving in his stocking, and he was the finest man at the ball.</li>
    <li> I tried it and I like it, will reorder again. Was skeptical about the price, thought wouldn&#x27;t work. But give it time. Your lashes will thank you. When I received it first two week I was so crazy abt it, I put on several coats and my black lashes would turn out white, but it was cool. They&#x27;re healthy and I don&#x27;t care how it looks.   I thought abt going to the salon and to have the lashes done for me but hey 200$, So what I do know: I put several coats on my lashes with double lash, let it dry, then put more coats and You will see how the lashes build up and then you put on your black  mascara and woyla! miracle! you have very long lashes on your own without salons. It works like a primer-builder! I like it and at least I know my lashes protected from harsh chemicals of mascara.  If you would sacrifice everything for your lashes to grow try vit A+D cream,rub a little ( on the roots of the lashes, just don&#x27;t get it into your eyes) and you re good to go. But that&#x27;s kinda greasy, thou really works.    I like double lash It works for me!</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve aged my lashes have become thinner and shorter to the point there seemed little point in wearing mascara.  I decided to give this product and another a try. I ordered both at the same time.  Since I&#x27;ve used both, I can&#x27;t say which made the biggest difference or if it is a combination, but frankly, I&#x27;m shocked.  In very little time, like less than two weeks, my lashes became considerably longer and within a month were also thicker looking.  It&#x27;s really an amazing difference for me.  The other product I use is called Rapid Lash.  I could have sworn I wouldn&#x27;t see any difference from either one, so I didn&#x27;t bother with a careful study of each, figuring by using both, when I didn&#x27;t see results, I&#x27;d just can them and be done with it.  Then I got this unexpected effect and I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use them every night and sometimes only use this product.  I give this one the credit for the increased length since it seems like it may be reducing breakage or something.  I&#x27;m giving the Rapid Lash credit for the fact that my lashes seem to have become thicker since that would be based on actual growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you only want to try one, I&#x27;d go with this one first.  It&#x27;s not expensive and you may find you&#x27;re satisfied with the results you get.  Then if you&#x27;re like me and want to try for more, I&#x27;d add the other to see if you get further improvement. That would make more sense than starting with both as I did.  This bottle lasts a long time and is definitely worth the effort.  All I can say is that I feel pretty again :)</li>
    <li> I found this in my mother&#x27;s room one day a few years agao, &amp; tried it. It worked so well and so quick. Even though your lashes are not gonna grow longer overnight, if you continue usage, you will definitely be impressed &amp; it will be well worth the wait. This is not one of those very-quick fixes, but you will notice a change in your lashes a few days after usage: they will be stronger, &amp; fuller. They start to grow longer in about 3-4 weeks, but works amazing. &amp; its a great buy because it costs way less than these expensive treatments that probably don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I got this product to try instead of the very expensive products such as latisse or Rapid Lash and can not say enough good things about this product. Before going ahead and buying it I looked at many reviews and was not sure what to expect but before I started using it I took pictures of my lashes. That was less then 4 weeks ago and I have seen a huge difference. My lashes are much longer and fuller and look great!!! I did read on a couple reviews that some people had issues with their eyes getting itchy but I had no problems at all....This is a great alternative to those expensive lash growth systems out there and a must have!</li>
    <li> The product did work for me, although not as much as I imagined. I was expecting to stop using mascara after my lashes grew longer and thicker. They did, but not that much. I don&#x27;t know if the other products that have higher prices would work better though. By the way, the first few days when I started using the product my eyes went red when I woke up in the morning. The next day I applied a little less of the serum to my lashes and then they worked fine. Be careful not to let the liquid get into your eyes, they can be a bit irritating.</li>
    <li> Tried it for week and I can feel the difference in my lash. It grows longer, not sure if it thickens however when I use the product my lash start to falls, not many like 1-2 but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my lash looks thinner. So I stopped using the product now and my lash stop falling.</li>
    <li> I used this product faithfully every night for about a month and did see improvement in the health of my eyelashes, but no change in their length or thickness.  I didn&#x27;t like the consistency of the product - it is such a thin liquid that you can barely tell whether you&#x27;re getting any of the product on your lashes, so I found myself spending several minutes applying and re-applying.  After those mediocre results I started using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Double Extend conditioner/mascara duo and I love the results I&#x27;m getting from that.</li>
    <li> I just started this product a week ago, and I can see already significant improvement in the length of my lashes. I did not grow more hair yet, and I am not sure yet if the lashes I have are really stronger already, but they are definitely longer, especially the lower lashes showed visible improvement. I think after just a week, this is a real amazing result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update how things are in about 4-6 weeks from now.</li>
    <li> Mavala Double Lash has worked very well for me.  I could tell the difference in my lashes within a few days.  I apply it before I close my eyes for the night, and in the morning my lashes are soft and thick.  The product was shipped immediately.      I will certainly purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This does nothing to increase lash length or fullness.  Do not waste your money or time. If you want to condition your lashes or eyebrows, use vaseline, that is all you need.</li>
    <li> Good product that works, but give it at least two months to really see a difference normally.  I have bought this a few times.  Good product for the money.  Only problem is bottle gets thick and gloopey about halfway thru and you end up wasting too much of it.</li>
    <li> This product does work.  It made my lashes thicker rather quickly and yes they grew too.  The one problem I do have is that it doesn&#x27;t come out on the brush very easily.  I have to dunk the wand several times before i get anything out.  I have been using for almost a month and the changes are noticable.</li>
    <li> I started to use this for two reasons...1: to thicken my lashes, and 2: to make them stronger because they break a lot. It took about 6-8 weeks for me to notice any significant difference and I can not believe the results! My lashes are not only thicker and stronger, (I have had no visible breakage) but they are A LOT longer! If you try this, just stick with it and don&#x27;t give up! The results are worth it!</li>
    <li> This product really does work!  I was skeptical at first but within 2 weeks I saw a true difference.  After 4 weeks, I actually have a a defined eyebrow and my lashes are long AND dark.  It gives great results.  The only draw back is that if you do not throughly wash it off first thing in the morning it can cause itchy, irritated eyes.  If you are diligent with the washing it is a 5 star.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and although the growth has been minimal, i can tell that they are thicker than before, maybe not a lot but there is somewhat of a difference.. but it is really slow. Maybe in another week or two the change will be more noticeable. i gave it four stars because its not a total sham, and it arrived pretty fast.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not perform miracles, so don&#x27;t buy it thinking it will.  However, I can tell that I have quite a bit less eyelashes falling out daily.  I can&#x27;t say my eyelashes look any different to anybody other than me, but I do think there is more thickness, especially along the bottom where my eyelashes were very light and sparse.  It is not going to make you look a lot different and it takes about 3 weeks of usage to see some improvement.  Plus, if you are fair and don&#x27;t have thick, dark lashes, this won&#x27;t fix that.  I ordered more of this product, so I am happy with it enough to continue with it.</li>
    <li> I had some fake eyelashes put on at a nail shop and it was an aweful experience. I pulled out some of my own lashes trying to get them off so I wanted a product that would help speed up the regrowth. This stuff works good. My lashes became a little darker and fuller within a week. I haven&#x27;t seen evidence of new growth that I can tell but I really love the stuff. It doesn&#x27;t irritate or anything. Highly recommend it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the really expensive brands that have horrible side effects.</li>
    <li> Mavala lash conditioner is working well for me.  The fact that I am now using a great product to stop drying out my lashes is a big benefit.  Am I seeing new growth?  I am but it was not overnight.  My lashes feel thicker and longer.  I will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I still have not received this.  Every other order has been delivered.  Please either refund the money or send another.  This isn&#x27;t my fault and I should not have to spend time on this.  Check my ordering history.  Everything else has arrived!</li>
    <li> The advertisement never says if this may change my green eyes to brown, as some of these products do.  So when I could feel it stinging after I closed my eyes, It scared me enough that I only used it once.</li>
    <li> It seems to work but I have been using it for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen dramatic change. However, I am starting to use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> After using this product for two months, I have noticed that my lashes have gotten much more fuller. It did not irriate or discolor my eyelids..I would recommend this product for anyone looking for fuller lashes...as far as length, the jury is still out on that.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before buying the product and figure for the price I have nothing to loose.  And I tell you, this product works.  I already have long lashes but this product is making my lashes fuller and longer.  I already received compliments about my lashes when I put my mascara on.   I definitely recommend it.  Just keep in mind that what works for one person doesn&#x27;t mean it works for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have very sparse, light lashes, and have used Double Lash somewhat sporadically, yet my lashes are definitely longer as well as a little thicker. Now that I&#x27;ve started using it regularly,I expect to see more results.     Because I have experienced a difference with sporadic use, I would not hesitate to recommend that others try it. I purchased it at Amazon because of the price.     I&#x27;ve now used Double Lash daily for well for about 2-3 months (uncertain when I started). My lash volume has doubled, and my lashes are longer. I would recommend this product but caution it can take awhile to make a truly noticeable difference to people with fine, sparse lashes. It can also be difficult to tell if your lashes are light in color. Mine did not darken, so again, it took awhile for me to verify a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, I think my eye lashes are getting just a little bit stronger but they are not getting any longer.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I bought this on a whim last year and have been using it nearly every day since. I barely have any eyelashes (genetics) and by barely, I mean probably 5-10 short bottom lashes and pretty short top lashes. Within a few weeks I could see the difference. New lashes were growing on my bottom lash line, and my top lashes seemed to be getting longer. It&#x27;s a slow process, but this has continued over the past several months and while I don&#x27;t have enviable lashes now, they are significantly longer and fuller than before.    This is a very good, affordable product that I will keep buying! A little tricky to apply (see other reviews), but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I started using this on a daily basis and almost a week into using it my eyelashes did grow, however I didnt notice any thickening. I was excited about the growth until a month later I noticed that my eyelashes started to thin and eventually broke off. I know this is very different results from some of the other reviews I read prior to buying this. I guess like many other products it just work different ways for different people. Since then, I removed the plastic cap and replaced the contents with a mixture of mineral and vitamin e oil and my eyelashes are almost back to normal.</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for couple years now - gives me a very soothing effect, especially after taking make up off.</li>
    <li> been using religiously on brows and lashes for about a month. no dramatic change in lashes. ardell works better &amp; costs less. slight growth in brows, so far. definitely hoping that i will notice more changes after a couple more weeks. don&#x27;t purchase if you expect results in a short-term time period! not great results, but better than nothing.</li>
    <li> its only been 3 days and the stuff actualy works, i useualy use dream lash and this stuff is just as good and in some ways better</li>
    <li> my eye brows were falling out and eye lashes also ,now i have more eye brows and more eye lashes</li>
    <li> Been using it for 8 weeks and I notice a huge difference.  Its definitely working. A++++ for this product!</li>
    <li> My order arrived very quickly and I have been using it every evening after cleansing mascara off my eyelashes.  I found the wand ineffective and scratchy, so I use a Q-tip inserted into the bottle and then dabbed on my eyelashes.  I have not noticed any difference in my eyelashes yet, but it has only been a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Mavala Double Lash really does work! Before Mavala Double Lash, you could see the bald spaces between my lashes. I noticed i had more lashes after 3 weeks! I used it every day or night and some days i did it twice a day and I had no harmful side effects or discoloration and I have blonde eyelashes and brows. I have accidently got some in my eye and it did not hurt at all.</li>
    <li> I am a make-up artist working in the entertainment business...films, television and fashion...I HIGHLY recommend this product and have used you it on actresses who have NO lashes and can&#x27;t believe the results...I also recommend it to people who have gone thru chemo! This company has rock solid products and don&#x27;t stop with the lash growin stuff..check out the prune mascara(my fave) and their polishes and polish remover pads and their eye make-up remover pads...takes off waterproof mascara easily without dragging the skin! LOVE THIS COMPANY AND THEIR PRODUCTS ROCK...take it from someone who has tried every product on the face of the earth on a daily basis!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m asian, so it&#x27;s no surprise that my eyelashes are so thin and short.     I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two months now (every night as instructed) and the results are minimal. This makes me so sad! I was looking forward to having a thick fringe of lashes after reading all the reviews for this product... and I didn&#x27;t want to use RapidLash and Latisse because of the side effects; Double Lash was my healthy alternative. My upper lashes are a little thicker and so are my eyebrows, but it&#x27;s just not what I was expecting after reading the reviews for Mavala.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, this product does not work.  I wonder who really writes their reviews and testamonials?</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks now and i do see improvment in my brows.  But only a litle in my lashes.  It only thickens my lashes no increase in length.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these eyelash growth products.  Mavala Double Lash, unfortunately, did not work.  First of all, I&#x27;m a little paranoid about product tampering, especially with something that&#x27;s going to be applied near my eyes.  The Mavala Double Lash bottle did not come with a safety seal around the cap.  It did come in a box, but inside the box was a single styrofoam peanut.  I found that somewhat odd, and it made me a little concerned that someone could have put something in the bottle.  Anyway, I used it on my brows for the first week and then decided it was probably safe to use on my eyelashes, which I&#x27;ve been doing for the last six weeks.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference.  And I&#x27;m not crazy about the odor.  It&#x27;s not particularly strong, but it has a glue-like smell.  Also, I&#x27;m near the end of the bottle and it seems like the remaining product has hardened.  It comes out in chunks on the tip of the applicator.  If you&#x27;re really serious about growing longer eyelashes, opt for Rapid Lash or Renew Lash.  They are more expensive, but I&#x27;ve had fantastic results with both of those products.</li>
    <li> I am utilizing this with Latisse.  I have stick-straight eyelashes and they become damaged because I must curl them daily.  I needed a conditioning treatment.    Between Mavala and Ardell&#x27;s product, this helps my lashes be conditioned and healthy.  There may be some growth on my lower lashes from using this...time will tell.  Overall I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I had seen this product on Amazon, and I thought I would try it to see if it would help my sparse eyelashes, which I desperately wanted to change, since they grew straight out, and I looked like I had no lashes at all.    I have seen a little improvement, so I am pleased so far with my results.    I have to be patient and give it a little more time, but I am happy with the results I have seen so far.</li>
    <li> I got this b/c I didn&#x27;t want to spend over $100 on some of the others when ppl were saying that they are getting great results with this.  It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks now and I can see a slight lengthening of my lashes. I have VERY sensitive eyes and it has not bothered me at all.  I like that it&#x27;s from Switzerland.  They seem to make pretty good stuff there.  I hope to see more results as the weeks go by.  I am satisfied with the value/results so far.  I would say that it is definitely worth trying b4 you spend alot of money on one of the pricier brands.  I had tried L&#x27;oreal with no real results at all after a couple of months.  I can already tell that this is doing something, which is more than the L&#x27;oreal.  bottom line:  worth trying.</li>
    <li> I tried it daily for 6 months and it didn&#x27;t make any change in my lashes.  I even tried not using mascara for 6 months with the exception of  3-4 times for special occasions.  I have friends that have used the more expensive Lattise and said it works.  (I&#x27;m not sure of the correct spelling of Latisse.</li>
    <li> About two weeks ago I took it upon myself to try and take off my falsh eyelashes.  I was told not to try and take them out on my own or I would pull my real lashes out.  Well, I made the mistake of trying and they were right......I lost over half of my eyelashes.  I was devistated.  I&#x27;m getting married in June and I thought there was no way they would grow back in time.  I started researching amazon to see if there was a magic quick cure.  I was very sceptical about most of the products I was reading about and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a $100 dollars.  So I came across Mavala Double Lash and thought the price was good so I would give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two in a half weeks and I put on mascara for the first time last weekend and I was so impressed.  They looked so much better. Fuller and longer. Of course I still have a ways to go, but the fact I could tell the product had worked made me smile.  I would recommend this product to people and tell them it does work.</li>
    <li> I bought this a long time ago and I really cannot tell if it is working for me because I just got lazy and stopped using after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I was quite sure I gave it 3 weeks to 1 month before I stopped, but uh... mu lashes look exactly the same -__- maybe it would work wonders for others, but not me..</li>
