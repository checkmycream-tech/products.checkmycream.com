### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The amount was plenty and the color came out perfect.</li>
      <li>Why would you not continue with a perfect product?</li>
      <li>This was a very good find</li>
      <li>The product itself is great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Worked great and has held up well giving a cream color finish.</li>
      <li>Product has always worked great.</li>
      <li>I loved this product.</li>
      <li>Good deal good product.</li>
      <li>give this stuff a try in my hair when the gray starts kicking in, but for now, it is making me cash :-)</li>
      <li>I started going to stores in areas where there are more of us Nordic types.  </li>
      <li>glad to have found it here.  </li>
      <li>Now my husband wants his beard done too!!!!</li>
      <li>This color, Sandy Blonde, is the perfect match for my original hair color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the original sandy blond shade for many years and been perfectly satisfied with it.  </li>
      <li>Why all the changes when things were going fine?  </li>
      <li>/&gt;About 2 years ago I decided to take a shot at making my own concrete counter top with integrated sink.</li>
      <li>As my Mom always said; &amp;#34;Even an old Barn looks better Painted&amp;#34;, This stuff does just that and more!</li>
      <li>Product works fantastic</li>
      <li>I have even color, but my hair is light brown now, which is not what I want.  </li>
      <li>It was very very easy to apply and the smell did not stink up the whole house.</li>
      <li>Cannot find the original Shampoo-in color anywhere....</li>
      <li>I was sent this Just For Men Original from Smiley360 in exchange for a review.</li>
      <li>I found the original sandy blond online and tried it again.  </li>
      <li>I love the product, mix it equally with Light Brown to get the shade I love, but I won&#x27;t buy from Amazon again until the price is in line again.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably a good thing you can&#x27;t find this anymore; we&#x27;ve tried it and it does well to last even two weeks before fading.</li>
      <li>What a shame, my husband and I used to love the old product.</li>
      <li>why did this company stop making a good product and replace it with one that evidently is not being well received by consumers.....</li>
      <li>I am the one who applies it and the person who noticed the changes first hand.</li>
      <li>It is a bold dark black and had great coverage.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very upset.  </li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t cover the gray very well</li>
      <li>Whoever is responsible for this disaster, please just go back to the original, and this time don&#x27;t be so skimpy with the product.  </li>
      <li>Easy enough for a guy to use and quick enough not to take forever.</li>
      <li>and the hair on the top was too dark.  </li>
      <li>I teach high school, and they can&#x27;t even notice when I use this product.  </li>
      <li>I had an extra box of the original and had my hair professional apply it.  </li>
      <li>I read a blog about using this stuff to stain concrete, so I gave it a try on the finished product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but that is normal.</li>
      <li>The new one is not enough and the product does not cover the gray very well.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years and always appreciated what it does for me and its ease of application.  </li>
      <li>This product lasts about 6 weeks for me giving a natural looking color.</li>
      <li>I tried the new formula in the white box</li>
      <li>My hair has naturally turned white color.</li>
      <li>Sorry if I didn&#x27;t use this product as intended, this is not a joke, and it did work great none the less..</li>
      <li>Way too much money for just one box, when all the other shades are a 3-pack for about this price.  </li>
      <li>It did fade a little with the first wash</li>
      <li>The new product is harder to apply and turns the hair orange instead of Sandy Blond.  </li>
      <li>Price is a little high!</li>

<li> Price is a little high!</li>
<li> New product way too dark</li>
<li> Normally I pay $20 for a three pack on previous Amazon orders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
<li> Please bring back the old Sandy Blond and the other way of applying it.</li>
<li> apparently no longer made in this color.  </li>
<li> This was a single kit that sells for 8.95 not three as the others</li>
<li> New System sucks</li>
<li> I agree with all the other reviews that said the new product is not nearly as good as the one we&#x27;ve been using for several years.  </li>
<li> I am now frustrated that the company has decided to no longer produce this blend and has half replaced the line with another application line that is a lot more expensive and not as easy to use.  </li>
<li> I saw it slowly disappearing off of store shelves and thought it was because the area I live in is heavily Latino/Middle Eastern/East Asian.  </li>
<li> All the other one&#x27;s including Dark Blonde, are too dark, and too noticeable.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a very positive person, but this is very frustrating.</li>
<li> I tried the Dark Blonde color, and I got critical remarks for at least 2 weeks until it lightened</li>
<li> All the other colors of this product are about $8, but this one online is almost 12 bucks.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure where to look for it, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to change brands and try something else if I can&#x27;t get H10..Sandy Blonde.  </li>
<li> I used the color black on my husband.</li>
<li> I have had trouble finding this in stores and found it on amazon.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t understand why this color is so hard to find.  </li>
<li> We do not have any other product similar to yours and we feel, disappointed, frustrated and just very, very sad.</li>
<li> Very frustrating to customers.</li>
<li> it is an outrageous price.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When I bought this, I thought it was a 3-pack, but it was only 1 box!  Way too much money for just one box, when all the other shades are a 3-pack for about this price.  I love the product, mix it equally with Light Brown to get the shade I love, but I won&#x27;t buy from Amazon again until the price is in line again.  I did find it elsewhere online with a 3-pack for this price of 1 box.</li>
    <li> What a shame, my husband and I used to love the old product. The amount was plenty and the color came out perfect. The new one is not enough and the product does not cover the gray very well. I am the one who applies it and the person who noticed the changes first hand. Why would you not continue with a perfect product?, why the change? Please bring back the old Sandy Blond and the other way of applying it. We do not have any other product similar to yours and we feel, disappointed, frustrated and just very, very sad.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great.  However,  this time I paid $20 for one box.  I feel that I got giped and I&#x27;m very upset.  Normally I pay $20 for a three pack on previous Amazon orders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
    <li> Price is a little high!</li>
    <li> Product works fantastic</li>
    <li> This was a single kit that sells for 8.95 not three as the others but I was charged  19 dollars  I mist have missed something</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and always appreciated what it does for me and its ease of application.  I am now frustrated that the company has decided to no longer produce this blend and has half replaced the line with another application line that is a lot more expensive and not as easy to use.  Very frustrating to customers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably a good thing you can&#x27;t find this anymore; we&#x27;ve tried it and it does well to last even two weeks before fading. And selling the remaining stock for these prices? No, thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, clip some coupons and get the Miss Clairol #103 (about the same color) for about $4.00 and it lasts longer, too!</li>
    <li> Good deal good product.</li>
    <li> Product has always worked great. I have had trouble finding this in stores and found it on amazon. This was a very good find so i can continue using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the original sandy blond shade for many years and been perfectly satisfied with it.  I saw it slowly disappearing off of store shelves and thought it was because the area I live in is heavily Latino/Middle Eastern/East Asian.  I started going to stores in areas where there are more of us Nordic types.  Eventually even they stopped stocking it.  I tried the new formula in the white box and it didn&#x27;t cover the gray very well and the hair on the top was too dark.  I found the original sandy blond online and tried it again.  This time my hair was patchy blond-gray-auburn.  My head looked like that of a Shetland sheepdog.  I had an extra box of the original and had my hair professional apply it.  I have even color, but my hair is light brown now, which is not what I want.  What have you guys done???  Why all the changes when things were going fine?  Whoever is responsible for this disaster, please just go back to the original, and this time don&#x27;t be so skimpy with the product.  I&#x27;m a very positive person, but this is very frustrating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years.  This color, Sandy Blonde, is the perfect match for my original hair color.  All the other one&#x27;s including Dark Blonde, are too dark, and too noticeable.  If teenagers are any guide...I teach high school, and they can&#x27;t even notice when I use this product.  I tried the Dark Blonde color, and I got critical remarks for at least 2 weeks until it lightened up.&lt;br /&gt;  Here&#x27;s the problem with Sandy Blonde.  I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in the stores.  Online it is an outrageous price.  All the other colors of this product are about $8, but this one online is almost 12 bucks.  I can&#x27;t understand why this color is so hard to find.  Walmart stopped carrying it a couple of years ago.  Now Fred Meyer has discontinued it.  I&#x27;m not sure where to look for it, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to change brands and try something else if I can&#x27;t get H10..Sandy Blonde.  What a shame.  I loved this product.</li>
    <li> need to continue making this product.  New product way too dark</li>
    <li> I agree with all the other reviews that said the new product is not nearly as good as the one we&#x27;ve been using for several years.  The new product is harder to apply and turns the hair orange instead of Sandy Blond.  Cannot find the original Shampoo-in color anywhere....why did this company stop making a good product and replace it with one that evidently is not being well received by consumers.....</li>
    <li> Sorry if I didn&#x27;t use this product as intended, this is not a joke, and it did work great none the less..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2 years ago I decided to take a shot at making my own concrete counter top with integrated sink. I read a blog about using this stuff to stain concrete, so I gave it a try on the finished product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked great and has held up well giving a cream color finish. Ended up selling the sink to a co-worker for $350 bucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May give this stuff a try in my hair when the gray starts kicking in, but for now, it is making me cash :-)</li>
    <li> I was sent this Just For Men Original from Smiley360 in exchange for a review. I used the color black on my husband. It was very very easy to apply and the smell did not stink up the whole house. It did fade a little with the first wash but that is normal. It is a bold dark black and had great coverage. Now my husband wants his beard done too!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair has naturally turned white color. This product lasts about 6 weeks for me giving a natural looking color.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.. Did not enhance my hair to a blonder shade.. It does not  for blonds.. I saw no change..</li>
    <li> apparently no longer made in this color.  glad to have found it here.  thanks</li>
    <li> As my Mom always said; &amp;#34;Even an old Barn looks better Painted&amp;#34;, This stuff does just that and more! Easy enough for a guy to use and quick enough not to take forever.</li>
    <li> New System sucks I wound up throwing it away.</li>
