      <li>Just been using this product for a couple of weeks (and not faithfully every day)and can&#x27;t see any great difference so far, but the lotion is pleasant feeling on my face</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more than worth the price!</li>
      <li>Its  makes my face smooth and the it has SPF 30, so</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and no blemishes.</li>
      <li>I tried this, as I&#x27;ve had great luck with other PTR products, including his PM Retinol Fusion.</li>
      <li>This cream has been relatively mild for my face.</li>
      <li>If I have gotten any dryness, it&#x27;s been mild, and then I skip a day or two before applying it again.</li>
      <li>A bit pricy though but worth it.</li>
      <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>The Amazon was significantly better than most other stores.</li>
      <li>I stop right away  </li>

      <li>i love this product and am on my third bottle.  </li>
      <li>I applied this in the a.m. on a sunny, hot day before I played in a golf tournament.  </li>
      <li>At first my skin had to get used to it</li>
      <li>This one sometimes has just a little bit of sting and provides a nice matte coverage.</li>
      <li>For real... I was like \\&quot;why on earth</li>
      <li>say it&#x27;s much improved.  </li>
      <li>really</li>
      <li>I love the texture of my skin after applying this - soft, supple (even hours &amp; hours later) without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My wife started using this product after trying many other acne products.  </li>
      <li>It also lasts a long time because you only need to use a very small amount for wonderful coverage.</li>
      <li>PTR products normally do wonders for my face.</li>
      <li>This will be my new summertime moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m having the exact same experience.</li>
      <li>Goes on light and absorbs quickly, not greasy.  </li>
      <li>Basically...the ONLY moisturizing sun screen I&#x27;ve ever used that isn&#x27;t chalky or greasy...which explains why I/m willing to kick down so much $$ for it.  </li>
      <li>This is the gold standard of retinol products as far as I am concerned - cannot be without it!</li>
      <li>This one is very expensive (compared to many others), but it definitely seems to keep her acne under control more than the others (and doesn&#x27;t dry out her face like some of the benzoil peroxide products.  </li>
      <li>This is super pricey compared to the drugstore stuff I usually buy, but my skin LOVES it.</li>
      <li>plus is that you definitely don&#x27;t have to use the whole pump of cream - half</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have very fair skin and burn easily.  I applied this in the a.m. on a sunny, hot day before I played in a golf tournament.  My face and neck were not burned at all.  Not greasy and no odor.  This will be my new summertime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Just been using this product for a couple of weeks (and not faithfully every day)and can&#x27;t see any great difference so far, but the lotion is pleasant feeling on my face and I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation.</li>
    <li> i love this product and am on my third bottle.  Not only does it provide SPF 30 protection, it actually does work evening out my skin texture.  I have a lot of acne scars and even my friends who haven&#x27;t seen me in a while say it&#x27;s much improved.  I&#x27;ve tried other products, and they tend to leave a greasy residue (and leaves my skin looking shiny and oily) or doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s working.  This one sometimes has just a little bit of sting and provides a nice matte coverage.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works!!!!!! I have been using for 2.5 wks, and my dark spots from sun damage are just slowly flaking off! thats me now, anyone that can deal with retinol should at least give it a go if you can!</li>
    <li> I use this product every night and it goes on wonderfully.  It also lasts a long time because you only need to use a very small amount for wonderful coverage.</li>
    <li> Basically...the ONLY moisturizing sun screen I&#x27;ve ever used that isn&#x27;t chalky or greasy...which explains why I/m willing to kick down so much $$ for it.  The fact that it has a label full of stuff that is constantly recommended for healthy skin don&#x27;t hurt none either. ;-D</li>
    <li> My dermatologist laughed at me for purchasing this product. He said retinol breaks down in sunlight so I paid for sunscreen only.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer/retinol product.  Pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have searched for a good moisturizer with SPF that does the job but doesn&#x27;t melt off in the Phoenix heat. I tried this, as I&#x27;ve had great luck with other PTR products, including his PM Retinol Fusion. I love the texture of my skin after applying this - soft, supple (even hours &amp; hours later) without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this product over &amp; over. I&#x27;ve found my daytime Holy Grail!</li>
    <li> This is super pricey compared to the drugstore stuff I usually buy, but my skin LOVES it. Not only does it protect *really* well (I&#x27;m very fair), but I&#x27;ve had NO breakouts, and my skin looks killer. For real... I was like \\&quot;why on earth does my skin look so good these days\\&quot; and then I remembered it was probably because I&#x27;d switched to using this a couple of weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just let it sink into skin for about 15 minutes before going outside and sweating... otherwise it&#x27;ll come off.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  Goes on light and absorbs quickly, not greasy.  Smells great!  Protects well in the sun, even without reapplying.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> It is easy to apply and my skin feels very soft and nourished all day. A bit pricy though but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have combination oily to oily skin. I used Retina, Retinol with another brand almost 7 years , I does not make me break out at all . After watched Dr OZ show , I purchase this Retinol, because It have everything in 1 with  retionl and spf together  . I used about 1 weak , my face break out acne , pimples . I stop right away  and i am  going back to my daily moisturizer and Retinol and suncream . I am frustrated , the blemish still on my face .  not work for me , but may  work for you !&lt;br /&gt;  !</li>
    <li> I always use PTR products. This one is awful. It makes your face white and sticky. It&#x27;s like a very thick sunscreen. I wonder if it was even PTR or if the person who sold it swapped it for a drugstore sunscreen. PTR products normally do wonders for my face. This is awful.</li>
    <li> I wish I had AMAZING results... but I didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer and provides the SPF protection however my skin didn&#x27;t change or get better.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer stated, their dark spots are slowly flaking away. I&#x27;m having the exact same experience. It&#x27;s more than worth the price!</li>
    <li> The cream worked exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and breakout pretty easily when I use new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First saw it on the Dr. Oz show and won it in the giveaway. I usually breakout with all these creams, but this one helped clear my skin, brightened it, and has reduced all the blemishes I had from prior breakouts. It leaves my skin extremely soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus is that you definitely don&#x27;t have to use the whole pump of cream - half a pump is enough.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con is the price. It is on the pricier end for face cream - but I&#x27;m making the splurge since it worked so well.</li>
    <li> This cream has been relatively mild for my face. If I have gotten any dryness, it&#x27;s been mild, and then I skip a day or two before applying it again. I especially like the mixture of vitamins C and E, and that it has an SPF of 30.</li>
    <li> My wife started using this product after trying many other acne products.  This one is very expensive (compared to many others), but it definitely seems to keep her acne under control more than the others (and doesn&#x27;t dry out her face like some of the benzoil peroxide products.  The Amazon was significantly better than most other stores.</li>
    <li> I will be reordering this product.  It is great and I only used a small amount each time and I still have some left after 60 days.  My skin is smooth and no blemishes. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I do like this day cream.  At first my skin had to get used to it but I feel my skin is brighter for it now.  I also like to wear it when I dont want to feel like I have tones of makeup on.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Its  makes my face smooth and the it has SPF 30, so I don&#x27;t have to use other sun products.</li>
    <li> This is the gold standard of retinol products as far as I am concerned - cannot be without it!</li>
    <li> Should be used carefully if u have a sensitive skin .  And u should use an additional SPF cream above it</li>
</ol>
