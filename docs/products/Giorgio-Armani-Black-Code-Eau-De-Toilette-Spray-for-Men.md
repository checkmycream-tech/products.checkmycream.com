      <li>I can say that Armani Code for Men is great.</li>
      <li>A great smelling cologne.</li>
      <li>Great</li>
      <li>it became a great Valentine&#x27;s gift.</li>
      <li>It still smells great, and I still get a lot of compliments.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m guessing he was happy with it.</li>
      <li>Good quality, received w/out complications.</li>
      <li>He has gotten so many compliments on this cologne I am jealous!</li>
      <li>Really nice smell and goooood price.  </li>
      <li>and I was able to find it at a fair price.</li>
      <li>so he could wear on our wedding day since it is his favorite cologne; just couldn&#x27;t afford it.  </li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>i love this one</li>
      <li>I will probly buy many more of these just to always have some.</li>
      <li>I 100% love it</li>
      <li>This is my favorite cologne</li>
      <li>if its authentic, i bought it from BeautyEncounter the 3.4oz refillable one.</li>
      <li>My son&#x27;s favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;the smell was very light and evaporated very quickly.</li>
      <li>Smells good, shipping was fast, lil spendy however.</li>
      <li>Purchasing through amazon is always a pleasure and the products are consistently genuine...</li>
      <li>They refunded the money without much fuss and as its a non refundable item, I keep the bottle with suspiciously water inside!!!</li>
      <li>One of my top three fragrances --- get many compliments all the time --- never gets old!</li>
      <li>Armani Code is by far the best scent and the longest lasting.</li>
      <li>Hello, I ordered the Armani Code 2.5oz even after reading mostly the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>My wife loved the fragrance and I am constantly getting 9compliments from others</li>
      <li>, I always find exactly what I need for a great price, shipping is quick, and its like getting a present from myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>however Amazon customer service quickly refunded my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has quickly become one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>Quick  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend Armani Code to anyone who desires a sophisticated scent that lasts and lasts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It upsets me that they sold me cologne that expired on me close to right after I bought it, but I would have never known if I didn&#x27;t find this site to check.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know the reason, but, they tend to all sell dated product at much higher prices...</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why we don&#x27;t just come to Amazon first</li>
      <li>Was first given to me as a gift by my mother-in-law.</li>
      <li>My item appeared exactly same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tear</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I am an avid shopper from Amazon and never had any problem.</li>
      <li>Samples of other scents were included as well which is always a nice bonus.</li>
      <li>it has that slight hint of alcohol that gives it a clean refreshing smell</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now the positive part was, customer service.</li>
      <li>The scent had too strong of an alcohol smell and the inside of the box contained the white vertical tear marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Product just as described, and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I travel the world, all the time, and as a result spend alot of time in airport duty free shops trying out different colognes.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something different and mild, this is your ticket.  </li>
      <li>am using this product for long and really familiar with the longevity and smell.</li>
      <li>Obsession For Men is quite nice and long lasting, I simply grew out of it.</li>
      <li>It smells mostly like a talcum powder  mixed with lemon  and some other herbs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This cologne is by far one of my favorites and also my wife&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I went to open the package I immediately noticed that the lid to the bottle was really worn...</li>
      <li>I believe this is sold through Perfumania, and I ordered this same bottle directly from their company Perfumania .</li>
      <li>I ordered for a friend and he is very please with it,  his girlfriend likes it,  and other ladies too.</li>
      <li>I do enjoy Boss Soul however it seriously lacks staying power, the same for Pi...</li>

<li> Every bottle I&#x27;ve bought directly through Amazon has checked out, they all have at least 3 years of shelf life remaining and are legit.</li>
<li> However I&#x27;m unhappy to report that I experienced the same problem that a few other reviewers noted, a Armani Fake..</li>
<li> It had been a few years since we had given him and when he said he was out...</li>
<li> I found this site a few days ago.&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;Although im not sure</li>
<li> After reading all the hype about this cologne, i finally bought it for a disappointment.</li>
<li> But for fake product, amazon loses 2 stars..  </li>
<li> But beware of fake product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> One of my top three fragrances --- get many compliments all the time --- never gets old!</li>
    <li> the best fragance for me! i love this one</li>
    <li> After reading all the hype about this cologne, i finally bought it for a disappointment. It smells mostly like a talcum powder  mixed with lemon  and some other herbs.&lt;br /&gt;Although im not sure if its authentic, i bought it from BeautyEncounter the 3.4oz refillable one. Anyone else didn&#x27;t like the smell or am i the only one??</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have that many colognes in my collection, a few i&#x27;ve had are, A&amp;F Fierce, Polo Double Black and a few others.  This cologne is by far one of my favorites and also my wife&#x27;s.  I will probly buy many more of these just to always have some.</li>
    <li> I am an avid shopper from Amazon and never had any problem. I got this product perfectly looking sealed box. But when I opened, damn, it was resealed. I request everyone to go though customer pictures posted with the product. My item appeared exactly same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tear at one flap.&lt;br /&gt;a white stripe inside the box&lt;br /&gt;the smell was very light and evaporated very quickly. I would say within 30 mins, it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product for long and really familiar with the longevity and smell. This is an excellent EDT for any men. But beware of fake product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad part was, it was sold by Amazon itself. not a 3rd party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the positive part was, customer service. They refunded the money without much fuss and as its a non refundable item, I keep the bottle with suspiciously water inside!!! so use as a paperweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star for the EDT itself. But for fake product, amazon loses 2 stars..  so 3 stars all total just to let buyers know about the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;California</li>

    <li> I can say that Armani Code for Men is great. I 100% love it and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne and I was able to find it at a fair price. I will not need another fragrance for awhile</li>
    <li> Good quality, received w/out complications. Samples of other scents were included as well which is always a nice bonus. Came on time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> One of the best fragrances I&#x27;ve tried. Results may vary depending on the skin. One of my favorites. I recommend it</li>
    <li> Purchased for my fiance and gave it to him at our rehearsal dinner so he could wear on our wedding day since it is his favorite cologne; just couldn&#x27;t afford it.  This was the best price I could find, even better than a perfume website that my mom swears buy!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent so I got this for him as a gift. he finished it so I&#x27;m guessing he was happy with it. LOL!</li>
    <li> I believe this is sold through Perfumania, and I ordered this same bottle directly from their company Perfumania . com a while back. I don&#x27;t believe I received a fake bottle, but they do sell bottles that are expired or close to becoming expired. I checked, and you can check to. I found this site a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...] in case they block it out it&#x27;s - check cosmetic . net&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It upsets me that they sold me cologne that expired on me close to right after I bought it, but I would have never known if I didn&#x27;t find this site to check. It still smells great, and I still get a lot of compliments. But I will not buy from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Every bottle I&#x27;ve bought directly through Amazon has checked out, they all have at least 3 years of shelf life remaining and are legit.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s favorite fragrance. It had been a few years since we had given him and when he said he was out...it became a great Valentine&#x27;s gift.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne my husband will wear and when he ran out we went to Stage, TJ Maxx, and Walmart looking for it but nobody had it. I don&#x27;t know why we don&#x27;t just come to Amazon first, I always find exactly what I need for a great price, shipping is quick, and its like getting a present from myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne by the way is great it has that slight hint of alcohol that gives it a clean refreshing smell but it still has that great manly scent and it last all day. He has gotten so many compliments on this cologne I am jealous!</li>
    <li> Product just as described, and fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Smells good, shipping was fast, lil spendy however.</li>
    <li> I ordered for a friend and he is very please with it,  his girlfriend likes it,  and other ladies too. ;-)</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Really nice smell and goooood price.  Recommend it 100%.  Price and size perfect. Will definitely but it again.</li>
    <li> I travel the world, all the time, and as a result spend alot of time in airport duty free shops trying out different colognes. Armani Code is by far the best scent and the longest lasting. Having used Obsession For Men, Givinchi Pi, Boss Soul as well as a host of others, the one I ALWAYS come back to is Armani Code... I prefer something subtle yet very long lasting, especially when on a 22-24 hr flight... I do enjoy Boss Soul however it seriously lacks staying power, the same for Pi... Obsession For Men is quite nice and long lasting, I simply grew out of it. Purchasing through amazon is always a pleasure and the products are consistently genuine... I would highly recommend Armani Code to anyone who desires a sophisticated scent that lasts and lasts. I also recommend purchasing through amazon.com, they are a pleasure doing business with.... I would further suggest avoiding purchasing high end colognes through Drug Stores as they are usually dust covered and dated, the same would apply to Macys, Saks, and other retail shops... I don&#x27;t know the reason, but, they tend to all sell dated product at much higher prices...</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something different and mild, this is your ticket.  I get a lot of compliments on this scent, and I have like 15 bottles of cologne.  This has quickly become one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Was first given to me as a gift by my mother-in-law. My wife loved the fragrance and I am constantly getting 9compliments from others so I purchased it for myself.</li>
    <li> Great It came  Quick  I love this product</li>
    <li> A great smelling cologne. Thank You.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this - and so do I. As long as Armani makes this product, we will buy it.</li>
