      <li>light and fresh great for summer</li>
      <li>You will be totally iconic and distinguished for your scent and unique fragrance!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true that your own body chemicals change the scent.</li>
      <li>Essencia de Duende is a lovely, light scent: lemon-y and floral combined.  </li>
      <li>This product came very quickly.</li>
      <li>Most smell cheap or too sweet or so strong it triggers my asthma.</li>
      <li>A really fine perfume at an affordable price.</li>

      <li>My daughters are now loyal customers/wearers as well.</li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone who likes to smell fresh and sweet.</li>

      <li>Will help you to know if this perfume is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;A side note.</li>
      <li>She is a career professional woman with need to wear very unique scents and garments.</li>
      <li>, right?  </li>
      <li>I made the right decision.</li>
      <li>Nice classic scent and chances are, if you&#x27;re coming here to find a perfume, you already know what you&#x27;re looking for considering Amazon doesn&#x27;t currently offer SMELL-o-VISION.</li>
      <li>Such  a lovely scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine summer perfume but can be worn year round because it&#x27;s not as light as some summer scents - it has heart &amp; depth in its makeup.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to perfumes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very alluring and draws the senses.</li>
      <li>It is light and lasting.</li>
      <li>(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really should test perfumes before buying.</li>
      <li>So much so I get jealous when people want the name.</li>
      <li>My husband bought me this a few years ago and it quickly became my new favorite.  </li>
      <li>It was a risk to purchase it without trying it on her skin first, but gladly everything worked and her hard to please nature</li>
      <li>Look over the \\&quot;notes\\&quot; ( this is to refer to ingredients) to see if these are things you are normally drawn to.</li>
      <li>I am an old fan of JDP fragrances, so I purchased this one for my better half.</li>
      <li>This stuff last all day and one bottle last a really long time, well worth the money!!!</li>
      <li>Those aware of his products are either global traveler (like myself) or people who accidentally purchased one of his products and become fans!</li>
      <li>Soft smell.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this perfume since the early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised at some of the descriptions of its scent.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not floral at all.</li>
      <li>Described like the smell of wood or leather or a wild meadow.</li>
      <li>and it is the original not a cheap copy like the ones in the flea markets.</li>

    <li> Admittedly this was for me and not my girlfriend, but she asked for it, so she got it. That&#x27;s how it works, right?  Nice classic scent and chances are, if you&#x27;re coming here to find a perfume, you already know what you&#x27;re looking for considering Amazon doesn&#x27;t currently offer SMELL-o-VISION.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Soft smell. Always great to have around, perfect for evening or day time wear. Love it</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely fragrance.  I get lots of compliments when I wear it.  It is light and lasting. I recommend it to anyone who likes to smell fresh and sweet.</li>
    <li> This perfume is really hard to find.  Amazon always has it all.  Great price for great size.</li>
    <li> Duende Essencia (Essence of the Elf) is another hit by Jesus Del Pozo. This designer is not well known in USA and this is why not many people are aware of his products. Those aware of his products are either global traveler (like myself) or people who accidentally purchased one of his products and become fans! I am an old fan of JDP fragrances, so I purchased this one for my better half. It was a risk to purchase it without trying it on her skin first, but gladly everything worked and her hard to please nature truly enjoyed this one! She is a career professional woman with need to wear very unique scents and garments. This scent is very different, mild, sweet, fresh, pleasant and like a breeze in the garden of freshly bloomed flowers yet not too strong! If you ladies want to smell different than your counterparts, workmates and friends, then try this because very few people are aware of JDP in America. You will surely get compliments and dittos for wearing it. You will be totally iconic and distinguished for your scent and unique fragrance!</li>
    <li> Excellent product...........Outstanding service .......Best purchase i&#x27;ve ever made on line...........Received item miraculously in 24 hours without expediated shipping..........</li>
    <li> This product came very quickly. It came in great conditioned. A family member of mine had worn it before, and it smells just like it should. no complaints</li>
    <li> This sounded like just what I wanted. I don&#x27;t know if the one I got was counterfeit or spoilt, but it smelled of nothing but stale alcohol. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I sprayed some on, waited awhile for it to settle, then asked my brother and sister-in-law to smell. The response? \\&quot;I don&#x27;t smell anything but alcohol\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it several times hoping something would emerge, but no such luck. I had to throw it away since you can&#x27;t return perfume on Amazon. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really should test perfumes before buying. The one star is for the lovely bottle and packaging. The contents? Zero stars.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent fragrence for people who don&#x27;t like strong scents. I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to perfumes. Most smell cheap or too sweet or so strong it triggers my asthma. Duende is light, clean, and has sort of floral and citrus tones. I&#x27;ve had many compliments on it. I recommend trying it at your local department store. Fragrences smell a bit different on different people so wear it for a couple hours and if you like it, compare the store&#x27;s price to Amazon&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is simply an exquisite aroma. Very appropriate for a refined woman.I&#x27;m happy because I think my girlfriend will be very happy with this gift !!! I made the right decision.</li>
    <li> Got hooked on smelling my girlfriend&#x27;s neck!!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume since the early 90&#x27;s.  This stuff last all day and one bottle last a really long time, well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> Such  a lovely scent.</li>
    <li> light and fresh great for summer wear</li>
    <li> I would rate the cologne a 5 or above and it smells wonderful. I have missed having it, It took a long time for me to find it. Now it&#x27;s mine again and I do love it. I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone. LaVo53</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!  My husband bought me this a few years ago and it quickly became my new favorite.  I haven&#x27;t worn anything else since. I get the most compliments and am always being asked what I&#x27;m wearing that &amp;#34;smells so good&amp;#34;.  My daughters are now loyal customers/wearers as well.</li>
    <li> Essencia de Duende is a lovely, light scent: lemon-y and floral combined.  It&#x27;s perfect for day wear, and when you want a light yet noticable scent.  It is not at all overpowering, yet everyone who comes close to me notices when I wear it.  I also like the fact that it&#x27;s affordable!  I have worn it for three years and it never fails to garner at least one compliment per week.  It&#x27;s a fine summer perfume but can be worn year round because it&#x27;s not as light as some summer scents - it has heart &amp; depth in its makeup.  A really fine perfume at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. That&#x27;s why I keep buying it and also the price is great. Best price that I have found. Get so many compliments everytime I wear it. So fresh, clean and sexy. Lingers with you all day.</li>
    <li> I luv this scent, my husband Luv this scent, I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over 10 years and Its great</li>
    <li> I have had wear this perfume for at least 8 yrs, I was not sure I will get the same quality via internet. I love the way it came packed and it is the original not a cheap copy like the ones in the flea markets.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend absolutely loved it..</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful soft fragrance that stands out everywhere I go. I have been wearing this scent for years and&lt;br /&gt;I am constantly receiving compliments about how nice I smell .</li>
    <li> My husband found this for me 13-15 years ago, at a perfume shop . Gifted it to me at Christmas and I&#x27;ve never worn anything else. Everyone notices it and I&#x27;m constantly asked what I&#x27;m wearing. It has become me. So much so I get jealous when people want the name. I&#x27;m surprised at some of the descriptions of its scent.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not floral at all. Nor is it fruity. It&#x27;s lite in a sense that it&#x27;s never over powering , never sweet.  It&#x27;s husky and heady yet fresh . It&#x27;s very alluring and draws the senses. It&#x27;s warm and comforting. Yet apropriat year round.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that your own body chemicals change the scent. I&#x27;ve smelled it on others and it does NOT smell the same.&lt;br /&gt;So keep that in mind. Look over the \\&quot;notes\\&quot; ( this is to refer to ingredients) to see if these are things you are normally drawn to. Will help you to know if this perfume is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;A side note. I am a Massage Therapist. Fragrance is a very important aspect in my business. In fact the lack of is usually the way to go because scent effects everyone differently. Allergies, headaches, stomachs upset are all common reactions to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I wear \\&quot;mine\\&quot; because as I said it&#x27;s part of me. All my clients love it. Described like the smell of wood or leather or a wild meadow. Natural and perfect. Non offensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just fresh &amp; clean but girly, too. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now for my everyday scent.</li>
    <li> My most favorite perfume!</li>
