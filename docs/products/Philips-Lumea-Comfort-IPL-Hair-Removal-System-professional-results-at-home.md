      <li>good product，and</li>
      <li>A good option for those who can use it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not seeing any good results after using it for 4 months (tried for about 10 sessions).</li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s nice to have this for at-home use rather than having to go to a salon --</li>
      <li>The instructions say it feels like \\&quot;a rubber band snap\\&quot;; I didn&#x27;t feel that kind of pain, but I did notice a bit of discomfort afterwards.</li>
      <li>But it id effective.</li>
      <li>She is quite thrilled knowing that she wont have to shave and can avoid the nicks and cuts that show up as a result.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was thrilled about Amazon shipping to Australia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You also get the advantage of using this in the privacy of your own home whenever you want.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle but over time can be effective.</li>
      <li>The review is honest and accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The light is quite bright, so it is better to do it in a brightly lit room just to reduce contrast and make it easier on your eyes.</li>
      <li>My epilator which has been great for many years is quick, easy and provides great results.  </li>
      <li>For a home system, this one is easy to use and seems to get fairly good results.</li>
      <li>I’ve been using an epilator for many years and have been very happy with the results, but I’m always interested in products that may provide better results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but those more than make up for how easy and effective this device is!</li>
      <li>If this device is still suitable for you, read on...</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s suitable for you and you have the patience to follow through the treatment plan, give it a try.</li>
      <li>She is quite impressed by how it works thus far</li>
      <li>, I must say that the light pulses are extremely bright.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s suitable for you and you have the patience to follow through the treatment plan, give it a try.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll just hope a better and more effective product comes out.</li>
      <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>As with most IPL technology, it could take up to 6 months before you would see the results.</li>
      <li>many over the course of months.</li>
      <li>With all the warnings in the accompanying brochure I cannot even say with certainty that it is safe to use.</li>
      <li>If the results change, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.</li>
      <li>As with most IPL technology, it could take up to 6 months before you would see the results.</li>
      <li>which would be challenging if you don&#x27;t want to accidentally overlap or miss spots.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been able to detect no difference in hair growth using this tool.</li>
      <li>I happen to love the sunshine</li>
      <li>/&gt;So how many devices do you have under your bathroom sink?  </li>
      <li>love it ..</li>
      <li>am pleased to report that I have seen a reduction in hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hopefully all hair can be removed after more sessions.  </li>
      <li>Additionally I’ve got to imagine that any product that comes with so many precautions that eliminates so many people from use, maybe just isn’t one that I want to use.precautions that eliminates so many people from use</li>
      <li>need more time to evaluate</li>
      <li>You want to make sure that you can indeed use it before you spend the amount of money for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but it works :]</li>
      <li>Part of the reason I wanted to get this is that shaving often takes the top off some of the brown spots that are raised</li>
      <li>I do wish that the power cable was a bit longer so that I had more maneuverability, but it&#x27;s nothing that an extension cord cannot fix.</li>
      <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried MANY hair removal devices.  </li>
      <li>Basically, the more contrast between the color of your hair and the color of your skin, the greater the success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I thought this device looked interesting for reducing shaving, so I ordered it to see how it works.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that as I continue my regime I will see increasingly better results.</li>
      <li>I wish it came with sunglasses because the flash can be really bright, even when it&#x27;s right up against your skin -</li>
      <li>so dark hair on fair skin is the ideal</li>
      <li>Treatments are easier with sunglasses on - the flash is pretty bright even with the device pressed to your skin</li>
      <li>It will become very fine and light, and some of it will go away, but you can&#x27;t get rid of all of it.</li>
      <li>for me, the benefits are positively remarkable!ously, this is extremely good news, so I wanted to take a moment to report that.</li>
      <li>The device has a rated lifetime of more than 100,000 light pulses.</li>
      <li>Because of that, I think it&#x27;s important to make sure these kinds of results will be sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;During treatment, the light exit window on the device needs to be in contact with the skin and the adjacent skin color sensor determines the suitable skin tone before the pulsed light can be fired.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fourth, place the device lightly on the skin to be treated, and press the button on top.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s good for 6 years of whole body treatment according to the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth mentioning that this kind of device doesn&#x27;t work for every skin tone/hair color combination and is also not without risks.  </li>
      <li>I nabbed it without reading any reviews beforehand and didn&#x27;t discover until I went to read the manual that while I am a perfect candidate to use it with my very light skin and very dark body hair...</li>
      <li>Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt like electrolysis does.</li>
      <li>I have to put tape on so many places on my legs to use this that it is kind of a pain to get ready to use this.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, painless and no need to charge it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was easy to use once I got the hang of it.  </li>
      <li>But it was easy to use without looking when on continues flash.  </li>
      <li>You can easily trigger the button by accident although it has a safety sensor to prevent that.</li>
      <li>is convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;good item to use at home.</li>
      <li>As of now what I can say is how easy it is to use this hair removal system.  </li>
      <li>on the pro side this is easy to use once you get the hang of it</li>
      <li>but she reports that it is easy to use and there is no discomfort.  </li>
      <li>It may emit the strong light if you accidentally press it</li>
      <li>The hair that is remaining, however, is so fine and light that it isn&#x27;t noticeable anymore</li>
      <li>/&gt;Warning....this product clearly produces bright amounts of light and care should be taken by ANYONE that uses it.  </li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s just so cheap.</li>
      <li>even still the light could not always activate.</li>
      <li>very much enjoy that I can do this in the comfort of my home and in my free time scheduling an appointment with my dermatologist is always a challenge, let alone</li>
      <li>The light is attracted to pigment</li>
      <li>This product was received for free as a result of the Amazon vine program.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was excited to try this hair removal system because I am always looking for something that will make hair removal easier (aren&#x27;t we all?).  The good news is that this is pain free, as long as you follow the instructions and read all the warnings.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to slow down the growth/regrowth of hair as long as you use it consistently and over a long period of time.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks so it&#x27;s hard for me to review the long term results.  But so far it does seem to be helping to slowly eliminate some body hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little surprised to see so many warnings on this product, though.  So be careful, before buying, to make sure this will work for you.  It doesn&#x27;t work if you have very dark skin unfortunately.  It also doesn&#x27;t work if your body hair is white, red, or very light blonde.  Some reviewers here say they used it on their face, but the booklet that came with this says it is not recommended for facial hair.  I was disappointed because I was really hoping to use this on my upper lip.  Of course it also is not to be used on pregnant women.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if none of the warnings apply to you, and if you are willing to use it consistently for few months to see a reduction in body hair.  If you want a quick fix this might not be for you.  It&#x27;s pain free though, which makes it easier to use long term.</li>
    <li> The Philips Lumea works really well from what I&#x27;ve seen so far. I haven&#x27;t been able to use it for the full length of time recommended, but I do see a slight decrease in the amount of hair already so I would expect it to keep working going forward and will update this review if it does not. It&#x27;s not very painful at all - you might feel a slight sting that goes away right away. I wish it came with sunglasses because the flash can be really bright, even when it&#x27;s right up against your skin - and I did get blinded temporarily when first using it. Other than that it&#x27;s super easy to use and I will keep using it as recommended hoping for continued results.</li>
    <li> This product is marketed as an at-home hair removal device.  I&#x27;ve been curious about them since I first heard about the No!  No! years ago and finally decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s worth mentioning that this kind of device doesn&#x27;t work for every skin tone/hair color combination and is also not without risks.  Before buying this it&#x27;s worth doing some research to make sure it will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I crossed that point and familiarized myself with the enclosed instructions I was pleasantly surprised by my experience with this. I&#x27;m sure it helped that my ingoing expectations were realistic.  I went in hoping for my hair to become more sparse but didn&#x27;t expect it to go away completely.  I also expected it would take some time and work on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least for the first few sessions, you have to shave the area to be treated first.  You then set the correct light intensity setting for your hair color and skin tone.  Then you use it to treat your skin.  I think I was most pleasantly surprised that this wasn&#x27;t painful.  You do get a slight tingle with each pulse but compared to, say, having your skin waxed it is much, much less painful.  However, the biggest difference is that unlike waxing where the hair is immediately removed,  this takes time to see results and even then doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of hair.  Because of that, I think it&#x27;s important to make sure these kinds of results will be sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this.  I&#x27;m curious to see how it will continue to work overtime but so far I&#x27;m optimistic.</li>
    <li> I will need at least three months to make an effective evaluation. So far, it seems to be ok.</li>
    <li> It seems to work very well, the product came complete and works. I have to wait a few weeks to see if works for me</li>
    <li> Has used this twice since receiving it.  This may take months to see a more profound result.  As of now what I can say is how easy it is to use this hair removal system.  It used to be only available on salons that may cost you not only a hair but also an arm and a leg.  Now that they are available for home use, you just have to spend the initial cost of the device and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to read first the specs before buying it.  It is not for everyone&#x27;s type of hair and skin color.  Certain skin and hair colors are more sensitive and may also not effective.  Darker colors maybe more prone to burning from the intense light.  Not literally burning or scorching but may damage the skin cells, etc.  It is recommended to try lowest intensity first.  We are using level 3 for now and we haven&#x27;t experience any discomfort at all so we will proceed to the next level for the next session.  Sessions are about two weeks apart.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this because I have used commercial laser hair removal and paid thousands for it. THOSE lasers had some results that sort of lasted (sort of). They hurt like crazy, but hair shed afterwards, as the pamphlet in this device said it would do. I still have to test for another month, but for this month, I used it first at a medium setting (you are supposed to start at one, but I&#x27;ve done laser, so it seemed unnecessary and a waste of time). Nothing happened. No hair shedding, and no noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time, I went full blast at five. It stung a tiny bit, but not much. (Compared to the higher settings on the laser I was using, this wasn&#x27;t even half the pain. It also wasn&#x27;t even half the effect. It has been almost two weeks, and again, no hair has been shed. I did one armpit, one half of my bikini line, and one leg. NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news, it surprises me they didn&#x27;t include any sort of glasses or eye protection. When I would get laser done, they required me and the nurses to use glasses at All Times.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m assuming that wasn&#x27;t for fashion, so it is a problem that this had nothing. And yes, you can absolutely see a lot of the flash unless you are purposely closing your eyes or looking away...which would be challenging if you don&#x27;t want to accidentally overlap or miss spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just hope a better and more effective product comes out. In the meantime, you get what you paid for. There&#x27;s no cheap alternative to real laser, if this product is an indicator.</li>
    <li> I have white skin with black hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used it to legs and thighs, its really reduce the hair 70% after 3 &amp; 4 tretments&lt;br /&gt;I love it .. Easy to use, painless and no need to charge it.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use - only one button to press.  Down side is there&#x27;s no marks on the outside of the casing to help you line up the spot that is going to be treated.  For that reason, there&#x27;s some trial and error and since the results take a while to actually see, you don&#x27;t get a lot of immediate feedback if you&#x27;re using it right.  It&#x27;s not too painful and some areas are less so than others.  For a home system, this one is easy to use and seems to get fairly good results.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to expensive laser hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the right hair color and skin color that is.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on one leg and kept shaving the other leg to see how they would progress differently.&lt;br /&gt;The left leg - which i used this device on - had significantly less hair after just two uses every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use once I got the hang of it.  Keep in mind the flash is BRIGHT.  Even with eyes closed and my head turned away I could see the remnants of the flash.  But it was easy to use without looking when on continues flash.  After shaving, I ran the device up my leg slowly - you can hear the flash so you know it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not recommended for facial use.  If you did use it for facial use you&#x27;d have to have serious wrap around sunglasses in addition to closed eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review with further results.</li>
    <li> Having pale Caucasian skin and dark brown hair, I am the ideal candidate for this product. As stated by many reviewers here, this product is not designed for blond hair or dark skin ... therefore, do purchase accordingly to avoid wasting money (if you are blond) or getting hurt (if you have dark skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it is a breeze. If one is using the product on one&#x27;s legs, one might place it at the ankle, press the button, wait for the burst of light, move it up an inch, and press the button again. OR, one might place it on one&#x27;s ankle, hold in the button, wait for the light (still holding the button), glide the device up one&#x27;s leg quickly and then it will pulse again automatically. The only problem I found with this &amp;#34;gliding and holding method&amp;#34; is that one time after I just showered, the device was VERY hard to glide and I ended up using it on the same area twice a few times since I couldn&#x27;t move it freely and quickly enough. However, even then, it did not injure the skin. The only problem that I encountered was that my legs were too skinny in places for the device to activate. I could not use it on my shins unless I came in at an angle and then pressed my leg flat as possible from the back ... even still the light could not always activate. Maybe a &amp;#34;pen&amp;#34; version of this product could be great for shins, knees, and other areas that might be too thin to allow activation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began on the lowest setting (as indicated by the instructions) and worked my way to a level five. This is currently the level at which I use the product. Level one was entirely free of all negative sensation. On the absolute highest setting, it very rarely produces a stinging sensation and is otherwise almost entirely painless  (I think the stinging sensation is the result of a stray hair the was not shaved down). For the purpose of this review, I used this product on just my right leg and right underarm. No doubt, there has been a decrease in hair; however, it needs to be stated that this product MUST be used diligently and following a schedule. I am not even close to knowing the full extent of this device&#x27;s potency. Therefore, I will update this review in a few months to report on the final results. Admittedly, I am excited about its full potential. (And, by doing only one half of my person, the result should be pretty clear). (It also warrants noting that I only have sparse fine hair on my calves, none on thighs, almost no arm hair, and moderate underarm hair ... those with more hair or coarse hair might have much more dramatic results more quickly ... and maybe feel a little more of a sensation?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I must say that the light pulses are extremely bright. I have tried using it with my eyes closed but it is still a SUPER bright burst! I have even had to close my eyes and turn my head away. Therefore, I think it might be a responsible choice to include eye protection with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much enjoy that I can do this in the comfort of my home and in my free time scheduling an appointment with my dermatologist is always a challenge, let alone many over the course of months. And, obviously, this is considerably less expensive! I can confirm that I see results; therefore, this may be worth a try for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/9/2015: I have been dutifully using this device for months now. My underarms are nearly free of hair. Likewise for my legs. Now, I do use it on the highest setting (Level Five) and there are occasional &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; moments but those more than make up for how easy and effective this device is! (And, it does seem to get a little hot? So sometimes I take a break between legs and arms). Finally, during my last visit to the dermatologist, I asked the doctor if there were ANY known side-effects or issues with the device (and those like it). He said that the device was perfectly safe (for someone of my pale skin color and dark hair) and had been well studied ... he also said that there isno danger with long-term/prolonged exposure. Obviously, this is extremely good news, so I wanted to take a moment to report that. I will continue to use the product for the foreseeable future ... for me, the benefits are positively remarkable!ously, this is extremely good news, so I wanted to take a moment to report that.

    <li> I ordered this for my wife and so far she loves it. I helped her in the first few treatment sessions so that I could review it objectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first. This IPL hair removal system is not for everyone. There is a list of warnings and exclusions that may preclude your use of this device. First and foremost, your skin tone must meet the requirements specified in the product description. In a nutshell, this device does not work on dark skin or certain hair colors. You also need to know about the list of &amp;#34;Do Not Use&amp;#34; criteria in the manual, which you can download from the support page of the Philips website. If this device is still suitable for you, read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is lightweight and has a rounded shape that is comfortable to hold. The firing button on top is large and easy to trigger. At the bottom is a power button surrounded by a set of LED indicators. The device has an adjustable light intensity setting from 1 (lowest/default) to 5 (highest) that you can cycle through with the power button. The five green LED indicators show the selected intensity setting and one amber indicator shows the ready status. When the device is powered on, an internal fan is switched on automatically which is not loud but definitely audible. It also requires an external AC adapter (supplied) to operate and thankfully the wire is long enough for most users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During treatment, the light exit window on the device needs to be in contact with the skin and the adjacent skin color sensor determines the suitable skin tone before the pulsed light can be fired. The light is intense and reddish in color. The light emitter recharges quickly and ready to fire again within a second, so you can slide and flash rapidly for a continuous application. The device has a rated lifetime of more than 100,000 light pulses. That&#x27;s good for 6 years of whole body treatment according to the manufacturer. There is no user serviceable parts in the system. So when it is spent, it&#x27;s time to get a new system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recommended treatment schedule is one session every 2 weeks for the first 4-5 sessions, and then every 6 weeks thereafter as needed. As with most IPL technology, it could take up to 6 months before you would see the results. My wife has used it twice so far. She can feel a zapping sensation whenever the IPL is fired. As expected, she hasn&#x27;t seen any immediate results yet. Neither are there any side effects or complications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a reasonably priced IPL system for home use. It is easy to use and has built-in safety features to check skin tone and make sure it won&#x27;t fire in open air. It is too early for us to tell if it will provide permanent hair reduction and to which extent. Nevertheless, it seems promising so far. Again, how well IPL works for you largely depends on your skin tone and hair color. If it&#x27;s suitable for you and you have the patience to follow through the treatment plan, give it a try. It may just work for you.is spent, it&#x27;s time to get a new system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recommended treatment schedule is one session every 2 weeks for the first 4-5 sessions, and then every 6 weeks thereafter as needed.

    <li> This device is easy to use and after only two sessions I have noticed hair is growing back slower. I&#x27;m sure that as I continue my regime I will see increasingly better results.</li>
    <li> you might want to research this before you use it. The list of warnings and people who are unable to use it are very extensive. You want to make sure that you can indeed use it before you spend the amount of money for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it worked modestly well. It&#x27;s not a miracle but over time can be effective. If you have the time and patience, it can certainly save money over going somewhere that charges thousands of dollars. Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt like electrolysis does. A good option for those who can use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hugely interested in IPL hair removal since I have very fair skin and thick, dark hair.  I was slightly less interested after reading all the dramatic warnings in the user guide.  I am following all warnings, including avoiding unprotected sun exposure two weeks before and after.  (SPF and time limits are provided.)  Also, I stopped using one of my lotions since it contains AHA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have completed two treatments so far (two weeks apart) on a test area - my upper left thigh.  I haven&#x27;t had any of the possible adverse reactions (which include blisters and bruising).  My skin does feel somewhat sensitive after.  On the first intensity setting, I can&#x27;t feel any pain, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is doesn&#x27;t take much time to use over a small, flat space like the upper thigh, but I am not looking forward to doing larger areas (or figuring out how to do the back of my thigh).  The results are somewhat patchy, especially since I try to move the device completely to avoid flashing an area twice during a treatment (that&#x27;s a big no-no).  Treatments are easier with sunglasses on - the flash is pretty bright even with the device pressed to your skin completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide says it should be about 18-24 months to see permanent results.</li>
    <li> I am an asian with quite fair skin and black hair. I bought it about two months ago. So far I found it is effective to remove armpit hair. I used it every other week and the hair started to grow much more slowly. Now about 70% hair stopped re-growing. Hopefully all hair can be removed after more sessions.  Not sure whether it is so effective for leg hair which is finer. Will try it and see how.</li>
    <li> A Christmas gift for my Niece-in-Law.</li>
    <li> it was not useful at all!!</li>
    <li> shuts down after three minutes of use and displays an error message.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair removal system for the last month or so and have noticed a reduction in hair! That is very pleasing since I hate shaving and waxing or defoliating tends to burn my skin. Having had IPL treatments on my face I knew at the right intensity my skin would be fine using this. It is easy to use once you get the hang of it. The first treatments are to be spaced two weeks apart and #5-7 four weeks apart and then as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated this a four because the information on Amazon doesn&#x27;t include ALL of the warnings and when to avoid using the item. And there are a lot. This was a review product, but I do have to say if I had seen the brochure I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it nor would I have purchased it. You are to avoid using it if you have &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; spots--moles, freckles, birthmarks and I assume sun damage. I have to put tape on so many places on my legs to use this that it is kind of a pain to get ready to use this. Part of the reason I wanted to get this is that shaving often takes the top off some of the brown spots that are raised and I thought this would be a perfect solution used with one of the epiladys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on the pro side this is easy to use once you get the hang of it and it does work. On the con side are the warnings about dark spots!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re up for some heavy reading before being able to use the Lumea Comfort you&#x27;re in for a treat. I nabbed it without reading any reviews beforehand and didn&#x27;t discover until I went to read the manual that while I am a perfect candidate to use it with my very light skin and very dark body hair... I have a seizure disorder which means I should not use it. But dangit, I had really wanted to use it so I did the idiot thing and risked it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally I had hoped to use it on my legs but due to the &#x27;popping light&#x27; factor which would be the reason for the aforementioned don&#x27;t-use-it I decided to go for my underarms only. (For the record I made sure I had my spouse on-hand in case anything went badly and I felt pretty safe since my disorder is not triggered by flashing lights). On first use at the lowest setting I didn&#x27;t feel anything. The next day the only thing I noticed was that my underarm hair was a little bit more tickly than usual. Two weeks later, for my second application, I moved to the second intensity setting and noticed a slightly overly warm but not quite hot sensation on the last spot. The next day I experienced the same tickly hair thing. So far, I&#x27;ve only experienced these two uses but with no ill effects I plan to continue my every two weeks as instructed regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I&#x27;ve reached the 6 month mark I will be back with an update to the review. :)</li>
    <li> Is this thing even brand new? It looks refurbished big time!!! Not a single sticker or seal or anything that hints you are the first one to open it!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this as directed every 2 weeks.  I have noticed the hair not coming back in where treated.  Places I missed I can treat later.  I was skeptical as to whether it really works or not and now I know it does work for me.  I am 1/2 American Indian so I do have the dark hair and med dark skin.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> If you have dark hair and light skin (I do), this product will probably work well for you. If you have freckly skin, very light colored or red hair or very dark skin and dark hair, it&#x27;s not going to work. Basically, the more contrast between the color of your hair and the color of your skin, the greater the success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had several laser hair removal sessions in a salon over a six-month period on my legs and I&#x27;ll tell you that even professionally done, your hair will not totally disappear. It will become very fine and light, and some of it will go away, but you can&#x27;t get rid of all of it. The hair that is remaining, however, is so fine and light that it isn&#x27;t noticeable anymore and I don&#x27;t even bother shaving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying this on my underarms and so far this device is pretty similar to what I had done in the salon. The &amp;#34;rubber band snap&amp;#34; prickly feeling is the same, and hair does appear to be disappearing, especially after the first try. I will say I&#x27;ve only been using it on the lowest setting because I&#x27;m fairly pain-intolerant, and on the lowest setting it&#x27;s pretty tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long - only a few minutes - for each underarm. For such a small area this device is pretty practical, and I like the convenience of being able to do it from home. It does take consistency and effort but it saves you time you&#x27;d spend shaving anyways so I think it&#x27;s entirely worth it. This is also a fraction of the cost of having laser hair removal done in a salon, and so far the results are very comparable.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work... I did the whole treatment as written in the manual.. and there was no reduction whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this hair removal system to get rid of unwanted facial hair (upper lip, hair line, side burns). I had IPL done at a clinic over 5 years ago (Brazilian and under arms) which worked very well. Maybe because it is a much more sensitive area and the hair is thicker, I saw results almost immediately but it was a bit more painful. After 1 use, I do not yet notice a difference in hair growth (but then again you need at least 5-10 treatments to see any difference). I am Asian with a light olive skin tone and dark hair. I use the 4-5 setting and it is virtually painless. I will update once I have completed 5+ treatments.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this.  I&#x27;ve had it about a month and If it continues to do as well as it has been it appears to be a really good deal.  It works.  I am using it to &amp;#34;chase&amp;#34; a few remaining hairs from professional treatment but to &amp;#34;chase&amp;#34; scattered hairs here in there was too expensive.  I have mainly using this on my face with no problems at all.  You do have to work to angle it in some areas but there are no parts that you have to replace as (I understand there to be) on other similar laser hair removal machines.  I do use it at the maximum setting and it&#x27;s virtually painless.  Occasionally in a sensitive area I will &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; something but not really painful.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but this thing actually works really well. Zaps the hair without pain and eventually kills the root. Slows regrowth significantly in the meantime.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Philips Lumea Comfort IPL Hair Removal System in 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a bargain at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled about Amazon shipping to Australia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works in Australia but had to buy an adaptor which is featured in photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was cheaper on Amazon than other retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have persevered with the recommended treatment plan stipulated by Philips for a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to report that I have seen a reduction in hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initally I was getting discouraged as I was not seeing any significant hair reduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gradually after 3 months of treatments I started to notice patches where there was an absence of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now deviced a plan where I undertake laser every fortnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be a little time consuming but I intend to persevere for another 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I admire about the Philips Lumea Comfort IPL Hair Removal System is that I have not suffered any adverse skin reaction.  I have not suffered any burns even when I use the highest setting possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a tendency to go over the same area more than once which is contrary to wha tPhilips advises. I have not encountered any adverse skin issues because of this.  Probably wasting flashes though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I am concerned this unit is safe to use on the entire body including the face.  Have not suffered any hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone who does not have any pre existing medical conditions such as folliculitis and other medical conditions stipulated by Philips in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideal for people with fair skin with dark pigmented hair.</li>
    <li> I thought this device looked interesting for reducing shaving, so I ordered it to see how it works. I find it to do a good job of reducing hair, to be a bit complicated to use safely, and to have rather scary technology that I don&#x27;t really want to continue using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before describing how to use it, let me say that it works. I tried out a small section of rather hairy skin, and it reduced the regrowth significantly. I have no doubt that repeated treatments would have the desired effect. So yes, it works. But please note that despite what the product page says, the instructions say this is NOT to be used on the face. I had hoped to have my wife or daughter try it out for a few weeks, but once they found out how it works, they declined to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is small for my hand, but a bit bulky for a womans hand. It plugs into the wall, and has only an on/off switch, which doubles as a power level switch (the device has 5 power levels). The device is a bit noisy due to the fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it only works with light colored skin. This is because only light colored skin will absorb light. That means it won&#x27;t work on a tan, or if your skin is too dark. The device has a sensor in it that is designed to check the skin tone, and not work if your skin is not right. I would not place too much trust in that personally. It will work on any hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the area needs to be shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, turn on the device, and set the power level to whatever is maximum for your comfort - they recommend starting with 1 (the default) and then increasing it until you reach a level where it is comfortable but doesn&#x27;t hurt. Yes, that means to find the level you have to get hurt and THEN back off. I used level 3. The instructions say it feels like \\&quot;a rubber band snap\\&quot;; I didn&#x27;t feel that kind of pain, but I did notice a bit of discomfort afterwards. But nothing that was really difficult to endure or that lasted more than an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, place the device lightly on the skin to be treated, and press the button on top. The device will emit a very bright light that does the work. Then move the device to the next place to be treated. If you like, you can hold the button down and it will emit pulses of light continuously every couple of seconds as you move the device. Personally I think I would rather just push the button. It takes about 10 minutes per leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, repeat the treatment along a schedule they provide: treatments 1-4 every two weeks, then treatments 5-7 once a month, after that only when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRAWBACKS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device has some limitations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It cannot be used on the face, per the warnings in the user guide, and due to the design of the device.&lt;br /&gt;- It emits a bright light, so it really cannot be efficiently used on areas that the end will not cover completely. It would have been hard to use it on the face anyway.&lt;br /&gt;- It comes with no eye protection, so it can only be used when put against the skin. The device has a sensor to prevent use if it detects that it is not near the surface to be treated. The professional models all require eye protection for use - and this thing is bright even when set on the skin - really bright.&lt;br /&gt;- It cannot be used in the groin area (if you know what I mean), although it can be used above the bikini.&lt;br /&gt;- It cannot be used on a tan, which is a problem, because (at least here is California), who doesn&#x27;t have tanned legs?&lt;br /&gt;- Your skin tone has to be light enough to use the device. There are other technologies that work on darker skin tones, but I&#x27;m not aware that they are available in a consumer product.&lt;br /&gt;- It is quite possible to have complications from use - the handbook lists a whole bunch of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: I&#x27;d be afraid to use it, but the technology does work. If you really need to get rid of body hair and reduce shaving, with careful use this device may be just thething you want. Recommended only after careful study.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;Additional information on how it works:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device works the same way that as the professional laser hair removal devices (only available to physicians) work - the intense light causes the small blood capillaries to basically boil, which removes the blood source for the hair follicles. The difference between this device and a laser is that a laser uses a single light frequency, while this device uses a range of frequencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professional models of IPL are used by physicians and in beauty parlors, but require professional training. Those devices are far more powerful than this model - about 5 times as strong. Doctors use this tech to treat acne and other skin problems on the face.thing you want.

    <li> I was not sure if this would work for me. I read a lot of reviews with negative comments. I do have freckles and I also have keratosis pilaris. Some of my hair is white. So I was not super confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has actually worked better than I expected. It does smart a little. It&#x27;s a quick little sting. There is no irritation after. I have very fair and sensitive skin. I expected a lot more stress to the skin. There isn&#x27;t even redness much after the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following directions, I have gone over the same area periodically. The Lumea is actually working. There is significantly less growth. I am mostly impressed. This is an extended process. But it id effective.</li>
    <li> Works as per the directions. Had results agter 1 week.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I&#x27;ve only had it a month and I&#x27;m seeing results.</li>
    <li> Have been using as directed my skin is def not too dark and I&#x27;ve noticed absolutely zero result!! Not even one single hair has disappeared since beginning treatment!! This product is a waste of money!! Just went to try and return and I&#x27;m two days past being eligible to return it.. Probably because I&#x27;ve been using as directed and waiting to see a result!! Extremely disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;is it work  with  240V/50Hz ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> I put off using this because I was afraid to try it. I have tried just about every hair removal technique, including professional laser removal, waxing, and electrolysis. I have even endured the torture of epilation. This is my first at home IPL. The worst issue for me is that light hairs and dark skin don&#x27;t work well with this system. The light is attracted to pigment so dark hair on fair skin is the ideal situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light skin, but I need to watch out for moles and freckles. I had some unwanted hair on my toes and I gave it a shot with a bit of trepidation since I am afraid of being burned. I shaved the area and tried it on the tops of my toes and feet. No pain, no burns, and it seems like the hair is reduced. I&#x27;ll have to try it again in a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be perfect for the underarm area, but that skin is so sensitive I wouldn&#x27;t want to take a chance burning that area until I am more experienced with this unit. This is easy to use, does seem to reduce some hair, not as painful as the professional laser treatment and a lot less expensive. You also get the advantage of using this in the privacy of your own home whenever you want. Laser treatment requires several applications, so a definite advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a perfect solution, and care needs to be taken, but it is a viable choice, especially for those with the right hair and skin combinations. I&#x27;ll be trying some of this on my face after summer when my tan has faded.</li>
    <li> -Philips Lumea Comfort IPL Hair Removal System-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device appears well constructed and the accompanying documentation is detailed (it has to be).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many other reviewers have noted there is a LONG list of precautions regarding who can or cannot use this device and under what conditions it may or may not be used. After learning more about these devices, I am inclined to think that for anyone considering an IPL device for the home, it just may make sense to first get a few treatments done at a salon to see if it is effective for you and whether it seems like buying one for home use would be a worthwhile investment. I can imagine the frustration in reading reviews from some users with positive experiences/results but about an equal number from the opposite. This might be a perfect example of one of those instances where truly &amp;#34;your mileage will vary&amp;#34;. This is the reason it may make sense to try this out in a professional setting first, to see first hand how it is done, and how effective it is or isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is not intended to have an effect within the 30 day time period which is the length of time in which I must provide a review. My wife (who has pale skin and dark hair) is the one in my family who has testing this device. So far after a month of use, we can see no results yet. She has been treating one underarm with it and one without. She does not find it painful to use, so that is not an issue. Obviously patience is required for results, and since there are none to report yet, that makes this a lame review, for which I apologize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jury is still out. I will update this review either way it goes.</li>
    <li> Really its helpful for such a small group of people that most people ought to pursue another device and one that works for way longer.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T USE IT BECAUSE IT IS DANGEROUS! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it on Amazon in the end of October and used it in the beginning of November.&lt;br /&gt;This product burned my skin and caused severe injury to legs and arms even though I fallowed the instruction. I am an Asian woman with brown to fair skin. My skin became red after I used it, according to the instruction it is normal, after a couple of days the redness went away and I saw very thin scars on the areas that I used the products I did not pay attention since it did not hurt to much, however, the depigmentation gradually occurred a couple of weeks after the first use of product. NOW, I AM MISERABLE BECAUSE I need to see dermatologist every week for the treatments. It has been four month, my hypo pigmentation hasn&#x27;t self heal at all. I have marks on my skin even though I only used the product once in the different areas. It sucks and there is no medication for my remorse for using it!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work when I first time got this item.  Now return.</li>
    <li> used it three times so far I will update with more uses</li>
    <li> Looks like a pretyt good quality product, however do NOT see it being effective. It&#x27;s been used per the directions for about 4 months now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time I use a laser hair remover. At first I was scared but now even the highest volume seems not enough for me. I use it on my forehead. Hope it works.    race: asian  skin tone: pale  hair colour: black  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  27/09/14    after one month I&#x27;m happy with the result  very effective for me!!!!!</li>
    <li> i didnt use it long time yet. product work ordinary. important point : the product is &amp;#34;muliti voltage&amp;#34;, but connect jack morph is &amp;#34;110voltage&amp;#34;. NOT &amp;#34;oo&amp;#34; like this &amp;#34;l l&amp;#34; so some people need another connecting adapter.</li>
    <li> Very cost-effective, but can only be used once, very troublesome. Cannot automatically. So it&#x27;s just so cheap.</li>
    <li> .&lt;br /&gt;This is very much my partner&#x27;s review: The machine itself is easy to hold and control, although prolonged time using the device can cause strain. When using the IPL Hair Removal, there is no discernible discomfort. However, this device needs a far longer period use over a couple of months. Each treatment period can take up to 45 minutes to do, for example, half leg treatment. Philips recommends 12 treatments two weeks apart, please prepare the area by shaving - no waxing or threading will do. Supposedly after 6 months, or so, the hair growth should show signs reduction. Now let us get real about this - as most women remove hair more frequently than every couple of weeks - the problem is how do you know if the machine is doing its job or with it is the regular shaving that is showing the results? A better evaluation period would be over at least 6 months. Therefore, for the sake of better/realistic review, this review will need to be updated later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, there are so many exclusions and caveats to this product - both in printed form and, unfortunately on the web site; which would be buyers really should take note of - to ensure that their skin colour and condition makes a real impact, on how effective this device will be. At worse, this item could cause damage to your skin. Also a word of warning to those who are sun worshippers, you will need to choose between the Sun or reducing hair growth with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> The plug is not suitable for my country.</li>
    <li> good product，and it work after 4 times</li>
    <li> The adapter doesn&#x27;t fit HK standard, so I haven&#x27;t started to use it yet. 😞 But I still have faith in Philips products.</li>
    <li> need more time to evaluate</li>
    <li> is convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;good item to use at home.</li>
    <li> The device never worked.</li>
    <li> The Philips Lumea Comfort IPL Hair Removal System comes with a booklet containing a list of dire warnings. Don&#x27;t use if you have been out in the sun, don&#x27;t use if your skin does not match the approved chart, etc. So by the time I was ready to use this gadget I had to wonder: Am I removing hair or giving myself skin cancer? But I had committed to reviewing this product so I soldiered on. I tried it on my legs, following the directions. After a week I saw no difference between shaving and using this and shaving alone. But I decided to try it again, as the directions suggested it may take multiple uses. The gadget is not supposed to emit its blinding flash of light unless it is fully in contact with your skin, but something went wrong and it began to flash no matter where I pointed it. A big disappointment to say the least. I would have to conclude that this product is a waste of time and money. With all the warnings in the accompanying brochure I cannot even say with certainty that it is safe to use.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using the Philips Lumea Comfort IPL Hair Removal System for over a month now, and she&#x27;s not seeing much in terms of results. She fits the criteria of having fair skin and fairly dark hair in order to use the product safely. Unfortunately after several treatments, her unwanted hair is still growing back at the same rate as untreated areas. She&#x27;s followed the direction and warnings, but it just isn&#x27;t working for her as of yet. Perhaps after several more treatments, she&#x27;ll see some positive results. As of now though, the Philips Lumea Comfort IPL Hair Removal System seems to be a failure for her. On the positive side, she has not has any adverse effects or discomfort like some people have reported even when using it at level 4 and 5. She&#x27;s gonna continue to use it for a few more treatments. If the results change, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.</li>
    <li> I have very light colored skin and dark brown hair. I tried the device for almost one month, and did three treatments with it on my legs and one on underarms so far. It looks like it is starting to work - I now have some small bold patches on my legs, and some thinning in the other areas. I was not sure what to expect when I was starting the treatments. The light is quite bright, so it is better to do it in a brightly lit room just to reduce contrast and make it easier on your eyes. I also hold my other hand to cover some of the flash and to guide the device over my skin. It feels warm during treatment and for a few hours after the treatment. I forgot I had a half-healed bruise on my leg, and this area felt warmer longer, nothing else. It might be tricky to make the device work over bony areas like on knees, and I found it helpful to scrunch the skin with my other hand around the device so it covers the opening, otherwise it will not flash - there is a safety mechanism to prevent the device from working when it is not completely covered with skin. The treatment takes quite a lot of time, much longer than it takes to shave the area, so I hope the effort will be rewarded. The instructions say that even when the desired result is achieved, I will still need to treat the area once in a while to maintain the effect.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to read the instructions, there is a long list of contraindications, so check if you will be able to use it at all.</li>
    <li> This product was received for free as a result of the Amazon vine program.  The review is honest and accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning....this product clearly produces bright amounts of light and care should be taken by ANYONE that uses it.  Specifically if you have a history of seizures.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review comes via my MRS who has been using this product as directed.  She has used it on her legs as a test and followed the directions of shaving first and doing the first application the following day; wait 2 weeks and do it again without the shaving.  She is quite impressed by how it works thus far but the results will take time to show and take time to reduce if not eliminate growth on her legs.  She is quite thrilled knowing that she wont have to shave and can avoid the nicks and cuts that show up as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will try and update the review as time goes on, but her final recommendation is READ THE MANUAL, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS.....  She wanted to make sure everyone understood that following proper usage will yield the best results.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter to try out.  She has very pale skin and dark hair and I think that makes her a prime cadidate for using this device.  It is early days yet but she reports that it is easy to use and there is no discomfort.  There is no immediate effect on visible hair but I think we have to wait a couple of months for that.  She observed that the instructions say to shave before using and noted that you should probably interpret that as shaving the day before using to allow the skin some time to recover.  She also noted that it is difficult to keep the device flat on her skin at all times when going over the skinnier parts of her body and that means you can get zapped by the light - I think that means I need to go and buy her some protective glasses.  I&#x27;ll update this review when we see what progress has been made on the hair growth - maybe in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I really wish there were more information on the product page about the restrictions for using this machine. I’m a nursing Mom, so that knocked this machine out for me right offhand. It kind of makes you wonder, if this machine can possibly effect my breast milk, what is it doing to the rest of your body? So, before you make this expensive purchase, here are some of the people who can’t use the Lumena:&lt;br /&gt;Pregnant or nursing (lactating)&lt;br /&gt;Exposed to strong sunlight or an artificial tanning machine during the past weeks&lt;br /&gt;Tattoo or permanent makeup on the treated area&lt;br /&gt;Dark spots such as large freckles, birthmarks, moles or warts in the area to be treated&lt;br /&gt;Eczema, psoriasis, lesions, open wounds, active infections such as cold sores&lt;br /&gt;History of kelodial scar formation&lt;br /&gt;Abnormal skin conditions due to diabetes&lt;br /&gt;History of herpes outbreaks&lt;br /&gt;Epilepsy&lt;br /&gt;Active implant like a pacemaker or insulin pump&lt;br /&gt;And this is not an inclusive list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are wondering if you can us this for removal of facial hair –&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to never use around the eyes and not recommended for use on the face.&lt;br /&gt;It’s not effective on naturally white, gray, blonde and red hair.&lt;br /&gt;And it’s not recommended for females of Mediterranean, Middle-Eastern, and South-Asian descent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the adverse effects include minor chance of minor skin discomfort, skin redness, and increased skin sensitivity. Rare chance of skin wounds and burns, scarring, pigment changes, excessive redness and swelling. There are also “negligible” chances of infection and bruising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all seems like a lot of risk for a product that by design will decrease your hair growth by between 50 and 70 percent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, as I said, I was not actually able to use this product as I am currently a nursing mother. So, I’m giving it three stars, which I consider a neutral rating on the five star scale.</li>
    <li> I have been able to detect no difference in hair growth using this tool. Though it may work for some it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> When I received the Philips Lumea I first read over the precautions as this was a completely new product to me and I wasn’t exactly comfortable with it.  I’ve been using an epilator for many years and have been very happy with the results, but I’m always interested in products that may provide better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the multitude of people that should NOT use this product.  Everything ranging from people that have spent extended time in the sun or tanning beds, taking certain medications, having certain skin conditions, breastfeeding, a particular hair color and/or skin tone and the list goes on.  At the time I received this I had been sun tanning recently as preparation for a vacation and wasn’t immediately able to use it; definitely something that should be listed on the product page in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for use, I waited until 10 days after my vacation to test it out and only then did I decide to do it in a non-conspicuous area.  I started on a lower setting with the plan to increase it, but with the first zap I was blinded.  My initial thought was did I miss the protective eye wear in the box?  Yes there were some warning, but this was beyond what I expected and I couldn’t imagine trying to do this on an entire leg, let alone facial area.  I thought about trying to use my indoor tanning bed googles, but the lenses are dark and you can’t really see through them anyways.  So I stopped at that point to do a little more research into this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final decision on the Lumea is that it’s just not for me and not just for the blinding light reason, but for many.  I happen to love the sunshine and although we don’t get an abundance here in the Pacific Northwest I take full advantage of it when we do, which means not using the Lumea.  My epilator which has been great for many years is quick, easy and provides great results.  Additionally I’ve got to imagine that any product that comes with so many precautions that eliminates so many people from use, maybe just isn’t one that I want to use.precautions that eliminates so many people from use, maybe just isn’t one that I want to use.</li>
    <li> I wish it didnt lit soo bright lol but i wish it lit faster its a long process but it works :]</li>
    <li> It really reduce the hair but I dont think that it will be gone one day using only this machine. I didnt regret of buying this machine, but be aware that it will not be the solution for yours &amp;#34;hair problems&amp;#34;. Also, it demand too much time to complete the process in any part of your body.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that the product is made is Holland not Israel. Production from Israel is not recommended.</li>
    <li> As a Asian,I have no problem to use 5 to treatment on my leg.&lt;br /&gt;there is not big different on my leg since I&#x27;ve used for 2nd times.Maybe changes next treament.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and bought this since I had a few places I wanted to cut down on the amount of hair I have. I have been using this for several months, and it does indeed seem to be cutting down on hair re-growth.    The Lumea IPL device seems extremely well made, and the packaging is nice, though focused towards females. I do wish that the power cable was a bit longer so that I had more maneuverability, but it&#x27;s nothing that an extension cord cannot fix. The fan is pretty loud during use.    My main concern when buying this was whether the flashes would sting, and even at the highest setting I do not think that the flashes of light hurt at all. The flashes are extremely bright though so I suggest looking away from the device when you press the button to flash the light, since you&#x27;ll still see a flash of light around the skin.    There is a smell of burnt hair after using the device, which I could live without (yeah, I did trim the hair first and the smell still lingered) but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> the plug is not good to plug into chinese type socket</li>
    <li> Great price best machine ever</li>
    <li> Great Product and seller. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been going to laser clinic for the past 6 months, they are not cheap. So I was looking for an alternative for a while, until i found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realistically, you cannot compare this to the laser machine at the clinic, however I think it is working well so far. At least I can smell the same hair burning smell just like when I&#x27;m having the treatments in laser clinic when i use it, that is a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started with setting 4, as I have had some treatment in the clinic, didn&#x27;t want to waste my time starting from the lowest setting. I can fell a little bit burning sensation, nothing compare to the clinic. In my second DYI treatment, I&#x27;ve used setting 5 for a little bit,  it hurts a bit, so I reduced to setting 4 for some sensitive areas to avoid the pain. It is a bit difficult when you are doing it to yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is still very early to tell. However I can smell the burning smell and I think it is doing its job, at least smell wise. It is not half powerful as the real laser machines in the clinic, so there will not be any instant results, be prepared for the long haul.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had about 12 professional laser sessions and I noticed a great reduction on my hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;This device stings me just like the professional ones (very lightly on the highest setting), so I believe it&#x27;s gonna give me aproximate results.&lt;br /&gt;I came to review it because I wanted to post a picture from this device&#x27;s box determining what kind of hair colors and skin tones work with it and save the wrong candidates from buying it and having to go through the hassle of returning. Also, I read here in one review that you shouldn&#x27;t use this device if you have PCOS (which I have), but I read my manual from cover to cover and didn&#x27;t find this information.&lt;br /&gt;Please see attached picture before you buy it and check if you&#x27;re the right candidate for this product. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get Philip Lumea -tried a Korean brand in 2012 that did not work. I was amazed to see patches of smooth hair free skin on my underarms. Working on the bikini line. The hair does not fall out like in laser hair removal. Not sure if it can get full bikini but it&#x27;s working on underarms</li>
    <li> Good, but not great. If you can, just go into a clinic to get it done. If you are just looking for maintenance, go for it.</li>
    <li> When I received this unit, I avidly studied the user manual as if I were preparing for my state board exams. I&#x27;d had laser hair removal done years ago, found it pretty time-consuming and unpleasant (each pulse felt like a little bee sting), and had seen that painstakingly removed hair come back even so. I guess you could say, I am a bit skeptical of hair removal systems and products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, there is such a long list of &amp;#34;when to avoid using&amp;#34; that I was amazed to find that, indeed, I met the criteria for safe use. Although I got this to use primarily on my legs, I also wanted to use it on my face (upper lip) but found that the manual does not recommend it for facial treatment -- and definitely not around the eyes. So, the legs then. I had to examine for any sort of moles or lesions or areas of hyper-pigmentation and would have to avoid those spots or cover them. After thoroughly reading the rest of the dos and don&#x27;ts, I felt ready to actually try out the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choose your intensity level with care -- I started on the lowest level because I was already nervous about it and figured I could adjust upward as needed. Make sure the area to be treated is clean, dry and shaved. You want to be careful not to treat the same area twice during a session and watch for blisters or burns (you&#x27;d stop using immediately). So, begin. The light pulses, and I felt a mild stinging in the area. It lasted as long as the flash. It wasn&#x27;t as bad as the laser treatment feeling, but it was noticeable. Slowly but methodically, I finished. It took quite a while, maybe an hour, for me to do a leg and then a little faster for the other. The next day, I examined my legs and did not notice any obvious redness though the booklet warns that you might experience this. You should also watch out for any signs of infection or bruising -- which I did not have and they say it is quite rare. Two weeks later, I did another treatment (had not noticed any decrease in hair growth in the meanwhile). Since I have had the unit for only a month before needing to write this review, I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed the predicted 75% reduction in hair growth yet, but I will continue the recommended treatment plan and update this review later. This is NOT a fast process so I&#x27;ll be patient. It&#x27;s recommended that you stay out of the sun during your treatment cycles -- which might be hard during the summer. I use a lot of sunscreen 30 SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my main complaints is that you have to have the unit plugged in for use. The cord is an OK length, but it is still annoying and the AC plug is rather large making it impossible to add to my power bar and thus I had to use a dedicated outlet. The handheld unit piece is also big and the angles that you must turn it to get to the areas might be awkward at times. Overall, I am hopeful this will work out well for me in the long term and it&#x27;s nice to have this for at-home use rather than having to go to a salon -- but only if it really does what it claims!I have had the unit for only a month before needing to write this review, I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed the predicted 75% reduction in hair growth yet, but I will continue the recommended treatment plan and update this review later.

    <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried MANY hair removal devices.  This is best in class, comfortable, easy to use.  It does exactly what they say it will do.  I used it on my full legs, and i see it lessing the hair.  amazing!  No parts to replace.  I used to go to the salon sometimes for waxing.  this is much better, removing hair in the comfort of my own home, less time consuming, less costly.  My waxing budget for the year was 7 times the cost of this one device.  Totally worth getting this device not only for the price but also because it really works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it under my arms / armpits.  Razors give me bumps and ingrown hairs in my armpits.  Waxing my armpits makes me red and irritated.  This was easy to use and best hair removal ever for armpit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how many devices do you have under your bathroom sink?  Are you sick of shaving?  Frustrated with razor burn, ingrown hairs, and nicks?  Tired of waxing?  Can&#x27;t afford laser treatment?  you don&#x27;t have to anymore…..this is best in class.  Go for it!  you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> Just got it and done my first treatment..will update when i complete more treatments</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little painful,but i can take it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not seeing any good results after using it for 4 months (tried for about 10 sessions). Design of the shape of the item is not really handy to the hands. You can easily trigger the button by accident although it has a safety sensor to prevent that. However, the sensor is not 100% guarantee smart. It may emit the strong light if you accidentally press it so please be extra careful.</li>
