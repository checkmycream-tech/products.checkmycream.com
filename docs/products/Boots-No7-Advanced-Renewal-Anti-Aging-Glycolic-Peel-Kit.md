      <li>I don&#x27;t think your suppose to do that, but most peels work better if you leave them on.</li>

      <li>This is a very good, yet gentle, glycolic peel kit from a really trusted UK brand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and to store.</li>
      <li>and I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be as strong as ones from a dermatologist.    </li>
      <li>It was ok, but don&#x27;t think I ll reorder, nothing special, not the results I was hoping for....</li>
      <li>- the brush isn&#x27;t the best, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter - it&#x27;s still easy enough to use.  </li>
      <li>Overall, the product itself works great.  </li>
      <li>The dosage is so light I can&#x27;t imagine it working for anyone.</li>
      <li>The brush is smooth, the product is silky, I just can&#x27;t SEE what it&#x27;s done for me.  </li>
      <li>Very easy-to-use with nice results.</li>
      <li>4 pumps into the dish, used the fan brush to delicately smooth over face avoiding lips/eyes/nostrils/etc.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to use</li>
      <li>I intend to continue regular use to maintain my new perfect skin - believe me,</li>
      <li>Great product and I have dry and some oily patches.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it three times now, and haven&#x27;t really been able to see any significant effects.</li>
      <li>Just need to find the right one for your use!</li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure that  I could tell any difference in my skin after using this.</li>
      <li>so this really does not seem to do more than that.  </li>
      <li>It is very gentle, but I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend is very aware of her aging and</li>
      <li>I am not sure what more to say about  this product except that it is a good value.</li>
      <li>I noticed my skin tone looked like it did 10 years ago within the first week!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several of Boots&#x27; products and liked them all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth its price tag.</li>
      <li>buy this, it is so worth it</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a move in the right direction.</li>
      <li>I received the product in good condition and exactly when expected.  </li>
      <li>It removes easily and my face feels really soft afterwards.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It came fast and I am pleased with the results so far...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a little on the slimy side, but the coverage is good.  </li>
      <li>I do this before bed and use my regular night cream, and the results are SO FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>I used the first one</li>
      <li>IT WAS MY FIRST GLYCOLIC PEEL</li>
      <li>this is my first chemical peel .</li>
      <li>I have used the product, No7 Advanced Renewal Anti-Ageing Glycolic Peel 3 times and so far have not felt a difference, have not noticed a difference.  </li>
      <li>I will take what i can get for the first time.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I tried this product.  </li>
      <li>This was the first glycolic peel I had ever tried</li>
      <li>this stuff looks like it works in the first week.</li>
      <li>Wash the glycolic peel off and then apply the special moisturizer to give your skin an extra special finish.</li>
      <li>I get better results from regular use of the Boots hot cloth cleanser and the intense serum than this peel.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used the product, No7 Advanced Renewal Anti-Ageing Glycolic Peel 3 times and so far have not felt a difference, have not noticed a difference.  If I didn&#x27;t know it was supposed to be a peel, I would think I was using any other inexpensive product which is supposedly used to tighten the skin.  I have no &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; which I expected.</li>
    <li> I read reviews on this product and thought I would give it a try.  I have had acne prone skin for what seems like forever and still had problems at age 34.  After only one use of this product my face was much improved as far as color, tone and fewer breakouts. After only 4 uses family noticed much improvement as well.  I have not felt this confident in my skin for quite some time and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the results.  I am now looking into more products that Boots No.7 has to offer.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job in making my face feel clean &amp; tighter, and my skin looks great the next day. Just put alot of facial lotion on afterwards!!!!</li>
    <li> I got mine in the mail on Monday, and used it that night, Wednesday night, and Saturday night.  My skin was visibly better after the second use, and after 3 uses, my skin is as tight and clear as after a facial!!  I intend to continue regular use to maintain my new perfect skin - believe me, this stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to use - the brush isn&#x27;t the best, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter - it&#x27;s still easy enough to use.  You just put 4 \\&quot;squirts\\&quot; of the gel in the provided tray, brush it on, wait 5 minutes (sometimes I do a little longer, but usually that&#x27;s because I forget to time it), use the provided pads to wipe the areas, then rinse and apply a moisturizer.  I do this before bed and use my regular night cream, and the results are SO FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> I use this, but I put it on and leave it on while I sleep. I don&#x27;t think your suppose to do that, but most peels work better if you leave them on.</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;ve only used this product so far once but here&#x27;s my take: I followed the directions &#x3D; 4 pumps into the dish, used the fan brush to delicately smooth over face avoiding lips/eyes/nostrils/etc. I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling or much of anything except maybe the every so slightest flushing/burning sensation but nothing to worry about at all. I used the pads after about 4 minutes and they felt pretty awesome. I have very oily skin, even in my 30s still, and am almost always disappointed with products. Even my makeup, after trying tons, I&#x27;ve settled for I still have to wash off after 4 hours, on lunch break, and reapply due to my oily skin. I used this last night and today, I didn&#x27;t have to wash my makeup off! Visibly less shine, my skin felt softer, and I think my skin looks clearer after one use. Other reviews mentioned having to wait awhile for results but for me, I&#x27;m already hooked. I need to continue and see how it progresses but I&#x27;m already impressed.</li>
    <li> this is my first chemical peel . I used it because I have some pigmentation issues. some part of my skin on face about 3 * 2 inches area became dark colored due to some previous procedure. This worked good in decreasing the pigmentation. I learnt in my prior research that the glycolic acid breaks thin fibers in the skin and thus dissolving the pigmentation or scar whichever. Though i felt little tingly for the first 2 days when i applied . I started to have no tingly feeling from day 3 onwards. I am a male. now i just bought some high concentration of glycolic acid. I have to see how the 35% will work. This product has nice kit. the brush i felt little discomfort in using then again i am new to all this being a male. I will take what i can get for the first time. I recommend this product makes skin feel good , sense of clean skin. Best Wishes with this product.</li>
    <li> Great! Will be reordering. Does what it&#x27;s says. No peeling just simple tighting and toning your skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for a cheap product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling cystic acne for all my life.. This has smoothed out my face &amp; all my marks are almost gone!!! My deep scars are almost flat too!! I&#x27;ve been only using it for 1 week!! I used it every other day for a week.. I&#x27;ve seen AMAzing results!! Finally something that helps!! I haven&#x27;t been without makeup for almost 6 yrs.. Now I feel I can just wear a little powder &amp; leave the house!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skeptical 35 year old African American male. My skin problems are hyperpigmentation and occasional acne. I&#x27;ve had Skin Medica Vitalize peels before and liked the result, but couldn&#x27;t afford another set. I saw some women on ET raving about Boots #7 products and became curious. I didn&#x27;t expect much from this at home peel because its over the counter and I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be as strong as ones from a dermatologist.    I used the first one and I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, but I did feel my skin tighten and the texture became smoother. I&#x27;m currently on my 6th peel within my first month and I see a noticeable difference. My skin tone and texture has improved. I&#x27;ve seen more of a difference with this peel within the 1st month than I did with the Vitalize one. Also, I don&#x27;t experience the peeling I did with the Vitalize. Peeling isn&#x27;t bad, but when you have to go out in the world and small pieces of skin are hanging off of your face, it&#x27;s embarrassing. Also, I can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t pile on a pound of foundation to cover it up.    The peel doesn&#x27;t hurt, but I do feel a warm tingle when it&#x27;s on. I&#x27;ve been progressively leaving it on longer. I&#x27;m up to 8 minutes but I won&#x27;t push the time limit too far. The instructions say no more than 5 minutes.  I&#x27;ll probably update this review when I finish the entire set (1 month on, 1 month off for 6 months).    One caveat, I use this with the Boots #7 Beauty serum so I&#x27;m not sure how this has affected my results. Nonetheless, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> not harsh on my skin..will try anything to keep aging at bay...love this...buy this, it is so worth it and I am happy I did!~</li>
    <li> Easy to use, my skin feels great afterwards. I just wish it were a bit stronger solution.</li>
    <li> Super nice makeup items I&#x27;m in love</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT WAS MY FIRST GLYCOLIC PEEL EVER SO I WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULDNT MAKE MY SKIN PEEL (I ALREADY HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN) AND THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT MY COMPEXION IS IS SO MUCH BETTER AND THIS IS MY 3RD TIME USING IT,THE KIT IS GOOD FOR 30 USES SO THATS A GREAT PRICE!!!WILL ORDER AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I saw this product while editing a beauty review of top-rated anti-aging products. I heard so many raves about this product that I had to try it for myself. I used it more often than suggested on the package and left it on my skin a little longer as well. I have a few enlarged pores from past cystic acne issues and some sun damage. After using this product for quite some time, I didn&#x27;t really feel or see much of a difference. I went in for a professional Jessner chemical peel and saw a major difference after my first time. It may be that my skin really wants something stronger, but this Boots product didn&#x27;t work for me. I am going to stick with the Jessner peels and see if I can do some light peels with this Boots product and see if that will work better for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and others based on a Good Housekeeping study that said this was the best of the at-home peel products.  Perhaps I don&#x27;t use it often enough or correctly, but I don&#x27;t notice any improvement.  Oh, well</li>
    <li> Yes, this is good.  My skin is not sensitive and it says leave on 5 minutes but I like to leave it a little longer.  No problems at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several of Boots&#x27; products and liked them all. This product, however, seems a bit average compared to their other products.. I&#x27;ve used it three times now, and haven&#x27;t really been able to see any significant effects. It is VERY mild, however, and may take a few weeks to cause any changes.  Time will tell whether I purchase this again or try another gylcolic peel product, but as of now, I can only give it three stars. Not the best, but not the worst product I&#x27;ve tried. My biggest complaint is with the instructions. They are MICROSCOPIC. I do not use glasses for reading, but I had to pull out a magnifying glass to see these instructions!</li>
    <li> I tired this product for about a week no results at all.&lt;br /&gt;I understand it is a low strength but I was looking for some type of results.&lt;br /&gt;I reached out to the seller and was told it is against amazon policy to return beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;I have been able to return lip stick that wasn&#x27;t my shade.&lt;br /&gt;Positives it was a complete set, fast shipping, get packaging.</li>
    <li> Saw no difference at all in any way.  The dosage is so light I can&#x27;t imagine it working for anyone.</li>
    <li> Not magical, and I probably don&#x27;t use it as often as I should, but it does give a tingling-tightening feeling, which seems to make the wrinkles a little less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Boots No7, so I will never say a bad word about any of their products.</li>
    <li> This product says it will remove fine lines and make your skin glowing and younger. But for me it didnt do anything. Maybe because the Glycolic acid was on 7%, but I didnt feel any tingling sensation on my face that I usually feel with chemical peels. When I used it on my face and it didnt provide any results it said it would.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make ANY difference, in tone, texture or pore size. Wasted my $$, Try something else. Even left on for longer like some reviewers suggested..</li>
    <li> I am extremely impressed with this product.  I have been using it 2 times a week for approx. 2 mos.  I have NOT had one breakout and some of my brown spots that were located on my lower cheek area have diminished just about completely!  Where now I don&#x27;t feel that I have to put face makeup on to cover.  I leave it on my face for 45 mins, with no issues (this could be because of the natural oils in my skin??) It has minimized my pores, dried up my Normally OILY skin!!! Which is one of the best features for me!  I no longer have to apply powder during the day several times.  I have received a few compliments stating that I have a glowing look (no joke!).  I plan on continuing to use this product for as long as possible.  I am now 47 and FINALLY happy w/my skin! ;o)</li>
    <li> Visible difference after one use. My face was glowing not red and irritated. Use as directed as I did and you will be pleased. Also used on my leg below my knee to fade a dark spot from a bruise didn&#x27;t think I would ever see that go away. Great product and I have dry and some oily patches. Also used on my chest to erase aging lines or wrinkle skin as I call it great value too.</li>
    <li> This is the first at home peel I have ever tried and I loved it!  I don&#x27;t remember my face ever looking so toned.  I&#x27;ve only done it once but plan on doing in twice a week as recommended.  I&#x27;m obsessed with Boots No 7 now.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I didn&#x27;t realize it was only 7 % when I bought it. I felt nothing with it on and saw no difference at all after using it. The brush spreads out too much, so it&#x27;s hard to get the product on evenly. Some of the reviewers said they left it on longer than the 5 minutes in the instuctions, so I&#x27;m going to try that and see if that makes a difference. On the upside, the product is almost odorless and has a nice texture.</li>
    <li> Good product but it could be stronger.  It is not the strength of what you find used by salons.</li>
    <li> Just got it but have not had a chance to try it yet.  Will do that in the near future.</li>
    <li> This product has less glycolic acid than Eye Creams on the market. I get better results from regular use of the Boots hot cloth cleanser and the intense serum than this peel. If you need glycolic acid especially for brown spots try MD FORTE</li>
    <li> this worked very well and the price is great I thought my skin looked much better and had a glow</li>
    <li> Thanks, the product came on the day that said, I used the product but still do not see results, but otherwise the package arrived safely and I am using it, then  I comment on this product later.</li>
    <li> I like the way my face feels after using this peel kit. My face feel fresh, tight and smooth. It&#x27;s easy to use and works really good.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference from using this product.  I will try another product to compare the results and see what works better for me.</li>
    <li> I have very senstitive skin and I can tolerate this gentle peel. Go for it. It&#x27;s worth its price tag. Not sure if I am looking any younger yet (smile), but it&#x27;s a move in the right direction.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product and I wish I could say that it&#x27;s a good buy.  However, my biggest complaint would be that based on the amount of liquid serum you are instructed to use, there are not enough neutralizing pads.  I use about 4-5 pumps of the liquid, and 4 neutralizing pads whenever I use this product.  With that being said, I am halfway done the bottle of liquid, but only have 4 neutralizing pads left!  I have been looking for just the pads in stores and online, but can&#x27;t seem to find any.  Overall, the product itself works great.  Every time I use the system my skin feels tight and tingly.  I&#x27;m wondering if I can just use the serum by itself when the pads are all gone...?</li>
    <li> Very easy-to-use with nice results. Am using twice a week and find my impurities are lessen. Would re-order. Generous supply.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure that  I could tell any difference in my skin after using this. Will try it again next month</li>
    <li> I received the product in good condition and exactly when expected.  Over all, I do not agree to the pricing at all.  It did not give the results I was looking for even for an over the counter product.  Seriously, if anyone is looking for a good chemical exfoliant, this is not it. I did not see any change at all in the appearance or texture of my skin, not even after the recommended amount of usage or following the box directions.  I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much out of it, but it was worth a try.  Excellent customer service though.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red or irritated.  I am not sure what more to say about  this product except that it is a good value.</li>
    <li> Excellent  product!  I  use  it about twice a  month.</li>
    <li> This is as good as any peel I&#x27;ve gotten at the spa. You can feel it working. It removes easily and my face feels really soft afterwards. A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s going to last me a while, but I would purchase again. Cheaper than a professional facial!</li>
    <li> This is very effective for evening out skin and brighting the skin, works great. It may be a bit drying so use moisterizer</li>
    <li> I do feel like my skin feels smoother immediately after use, but I&#x27;m not sure how they can get away with calling this a peel. There is absolutely no peeling.</li>
    <li> It was not what I thought it would be.  I have never used a this type of peel.  I&#x27;m thinking that it prob should be stronger?  I have used for 3 weeks now and can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> Saw this advertised on morning T.V.. I am looking forward to trying.  I bought to reduce appearance of brown spots.</li>
    <li> This is a very good, yet gentle, glycolic peel kit from a really trusted UK brand. My skin is very sensitive and I often break out in a reaction to other creams and make up. Not with this line of products. I use this product about once a month to remove dried skin and to brighten my complexion.  The best advice is to cleans before hand with something fairly gentle (Boots No.7 Foaming Cleanser is my favorite), and then apply the glycolic peel. Leave it on and wait for it to tighten the skin. Wash the glycolic peel off and then apply the special moisturizer to give your skin an extra special finish.</li>
    <li> This product is very disappointing. The brush is useless and the cream does not work as the advertisement said it would. I feel cheated.</li>
    <li> Have used a couple of times makes my skin feel wonderful highly recommend love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once so I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;d it works.  But I am extremely frustrated by the directions. How can Anyone read the tiny print?  How ironic this is an anti-aging product and the directions cannot be read by the consumer.</li>
    <li> I have what I was describe as insensitive skin. Nothing bothers my skin. This stuff didn&#x27;t sting or anything so I am incredulous that it is doing anything to my skin. Olay&#x27;s micro-dermabrasion and peel kit works a million times better then this stuff does for me, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all using this... but it&#x27;s only 7% concentrated... so thats probably the problem for me.</li>
    <li> This product had no effect on my skin</li>
    <li> This is a must have. It makes your skin look and feel great. I am in my late 50&#x27;s, and have fair Irish skin. I have had no issues with any irritation. It&#x27;s easy to use and to store. I am a big fan of No 7 products, and this is one of their best.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried this product.  It was ok, but don&#x27;t think I ll reorder, nothing special, not the results I was hoping for....</li>
    <li> This was the first glycolic peel I had ever tried and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  It&#x27;s fast and convenient (5 minutes max) and is very gentle on the skin.  I noticed my skin tone looked like it did 10 years ago within the first week!</li>
    <li> After using this product, my skin seems a little brighter. It is very gentle, but I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the process of testing still but so far it&#x27;s thumbs up.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came fast and I am pleased with the results so far...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks...</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is very aware of her aging and this stuff looks like it works in the first week. great stuff</li>
    <li> I use an exfoliating cleanser so this really does not seem to do more than that.  If you do not use another type of exfoliation this might be up your alley.  I had no adverse affects, no burning etc.  It comes highly recommended by a consumer group, which is why I tried it.  (I am 60 and have normal skin).</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference! I&#x27;ve used it three times....maybe it takes longer.</li>
    <li> compared to six weeks ago, something is making a difference.  My complexion is not as &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34; as it was.  I&#x27;m also using the 3 piece Lift and Luminate, and Protect and Perfect Serum, as well as this Anti-Ageing Gycolic Peel (posting the same review and rating under each of those), so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a change in diet, these skin treatments, or a combination of all, but SOMETHING is working.  Yay!</li>
    <li> Seems there are a great deal of anti-aging products on the market which this one really feels good on your face but how well does it really work? As good as others if you are vey consistent with the usage. Just need to find the right one for your use!</li>
    <li> The prodcut feels good and you get that little tingle you expect from an decent facial peel. I recommend this along with the serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now and can&#x27;t really tell what it does.  It doesn&#x27;t sting or feel cooling or like anything&#x27;s &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; as it&#x27;s on my skin.  it&#x27;s a little on the slimy side, but the coverage is good.  It says to use 4 drops, but I use 6 to fully cover.  Maybe I have a bigger face.  LOL!!  The brush is smooth, the product is silky, I just can&#x27;t SEE what it&#x27;s done for me.  The pads you use to wipe the mask off are very puffy and almost have a soapy feel to them.  After using, I still have to rinse my face with water, which I don&#x27;t think is the point.  I do love my No7 moisturizer and ant-aging cream, but this part of this system was a bit disappointing.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be a repeat buyer on this particular product.</li>
