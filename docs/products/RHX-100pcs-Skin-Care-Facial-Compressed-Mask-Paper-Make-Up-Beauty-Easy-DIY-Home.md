      <li>and they&#x27;re just great.   </li>
      <li>As described and great masks.</li>
      <li>Perfect fit for my face.</li>
      <li>I have used them and love them.</li>
      <li>I should use them more often.</li>
      <li>Pretty good, one size &amp;#34;fits all&amp;#34; .</li>
      <li>They are easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and transport.</li>
      <li>but very useful~ I will buy it again.</li>
      <li>They are great for camping or for even as a wet towel.</li>
      <li>It takes about 20 days to arrive, but it&#x27;s pretty good!Cheap</li>
      <li>Never expected such a good product.</li>
      <li>I actually received 103 of them, including a huge mask.</li>
      <li>I used the huge one, it was actually a big square shaped &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really enjoy these facial paper mask; I soak them in a desincrustante tonic and then place it on client&#x27;s face for 15 minutes over steam.</li>
      <li>It is working very well since I have been using this for some time.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>These masks are smaller than what you can usually find&lt;br /&gt;Overall,this was a good item</li>
      <li>They come apart fairly easy and don&#x27;t fall apart while I whipping my face down.  </li>
      <li>Soak them in your first essence, squeeze them out, and lube &#x27;em up with some hyaluronic acid and sit back and relax.</li>
      <li>And my mother does not have sensitive skin AT ALL!</li>
      <li>It is small, light, very convenient to take and to make a simple mask.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the extra piece of facial mask.</li>
      <li>However, from the very first time I used these my skin started burning within a few minutes.</li>
      <li>I used these a few more times on different days and the same thing kept happening, so I gave one to my mother to try and the same thing happened to her.</li>
      <li>First of all, let me just say that I have used many DIY sheet masks throughout the years, and I have never had a bad experience.</li>

<li> , if you have a smaller face and all other individual mask packs has been too big on you, then this is what you are looking for.</li>
<li> Once wet.</li>
<li> There are a lot of other liquid can be used like yogurt, egg, cucumber water, etc.</li>
<li> I cut out the eye and nose flaps and leave them on for a half hour or so.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> The liquid I usually use is milk, it do help for brightening.</li>
<li> I soak these in whatever - 10% glycolic or lactic acid, lotion, oil, cooled-down green tea, or just cold water and stick on my face.  </li>
<li> I was so incredibly disappointed with these.</li>

    <li> I counted these once it came and I got 99 of the ones in the image and one huuuge one&lt;br /&gt;When I used the huge one, it was actually a big square shaped &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know what to do with that&lt;br /&gt;In addition, if you have a smaller face and all other individual mask packs has been too big on you, then this is what you are looking for. These masks are smaller than what you can usually find&lt;br /&gt;Overall,this was a good item</li>
    <li> Never expected such a good product. Thank you</li>
    <li> I could not believe my eyes when I saw that it was shipped from China! it was only about 5 dollars! I chose this because I used this compressed mask paper quite a lot before I come here. It is small, light, very convenient to take and to make a simple mask. The liquid I usually use is milk, it do help for brightening. There are a lot of other liquid can be used like yogurt, egg, cucumber water, etc. Thanks for the extra piece of facial mask.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these facial paper mask; I soak them in a desincrustante tonic and then place it on client&#x27;s face for 15 minutes over steam. I also add a few drops of essential oil, which is much appreciated by my clients.</li>
    <li> As described and great masks. I have used them and love them.</li>
    <li> It is working very well since I have been using this for some time. Will recommend to buy this product</li>
    <li> Just received them in my mail today and used them immediately... Perfect fit for my face. I actually received 103 of them, including a huge mask. Will definitely repurchase them from this seller again!</li>
    <li> A++++ just what the product says!&lt;br /&gt;These are COTTON! ~  NOT PAPER!! ~ AWESOME buy!&lt;br /&gt;one bonus/surprise piece inside!!</li>
    <li> same as what I used in China!!</li>
    <li> Pretty good, one size &amp;#34;fits all&amp;#34; . Needs to be embedded with desincrustation lotion and then place under the steam in order to work well.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me just say that I have used many DIY sheet masks throughout the years, and I have never had a bad experience. However, from the very first time I used these my skin started burning within a few minutes. I took the mask off and my face was absolutely RED and BURNING! I used these a few more times on different days and the same thing kept happening, so I gave one to my mother to try and the same thing happened to her. And my mother does not have sensitive skin AT ALL! I was so incredibly disappointed with these. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and transport.</li>
    <li> I like them. They are easy to use. Once wet. They come apart fairly easy and don&#x27;t fall apart while I whipping my face down.  They are great for camping or for even as a wet towel. It&#x27;s just not soapy.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re at all into masks and Asian skin care, grab some of these. Soak them in your first essence, squeeze them out, and lube &#x27;em up with some hyaluronic acid and sit back and relax. I started doing that and topping them off with oil or Hada Labo&#x27;s hyaluronic acid jelly and they&#x27;re just great.   I soak these in whatever - 10% glycolic or lactic acid, lotion, oil, cooled-down green tea, or just cold water and stick on my face.  I cut out the eye and nose flaps and leave them on for a half hour or so. I should use them more often. Great price!</li>
    <li> It takes about 20 days to arrive, but it&#x27;s pretty good!Cheap but very useful~ I will buy it again. Thanks</li>
