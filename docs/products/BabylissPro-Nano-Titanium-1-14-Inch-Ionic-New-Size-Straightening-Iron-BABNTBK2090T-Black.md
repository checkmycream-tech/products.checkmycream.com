    <li> I loved my Chi, had it for years, and when it broke, my hair dresser suggested this. I love it. I have really thick and curly hair and I can get through my hair quickly with this and it doesn&#x27;t damage it and leaves my hair soft and straight. It so smooth and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, I would use this over a chi anyday now!!</li>
    <li> does not get hot enough</li>
    <li> Love this bought it because my friend has one.  Left my hair looking gorgeous!</li>
    <li> I like the product but not as much as my other one I had.  I do like how fast it heats up though.  It gets the job done. I chose this based on the ratings it had but it is more expensive than what I paid for the Solia one I had.</li>
    <li> It is a good investment because it is very efficient to straighten hair and is dimensioned to facilitate the maneuver during smoothing. My hair is fine with curls and iron works very well at an average temperature. It is also easy to transport.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS IRON!!!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS IRON!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WISH I COULD DO A NEGATIVE STARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WISH I WOULD&#x27;VE LISTENED TO THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$100 TOTALITY WASTED. 1 WEEK AFTER THE RETURN POLICY ENDS THE IRON IS BROKEN!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS NOT BABYLISS QUALITY AND I SHOULD&#x27;VE KNOWN BETTER. PLEASE DON&#x27;T BUY THIS JUNK!</li>
    <li> Twice--the company has sent the 1 inch instead of the 1 and 1/4inch ordered (I&#x27;m quoting my wife). The product apparently is good. But for now--a little miffed it will not be a Christmas present as hoped.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested this brand instead of the Chi for my teenage daughter.  SHE LOVES IT!  She has had many low priced to under $75 hair straighteners and she is in love with the results from this one.</li>
    <li> Stopped working in less than 2 months. Apparently I have no recourse at this time. I won&#x27;t use Beaute Estella again. UPDATE... it works in the kitchen so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s my electrical outlet &amp; the prongs on this flatiron. My other electric appliances for my hair work in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser has this same exact flat iron and I love how my hair looks and feel after she uses it on me so I went ahead and bought one , at first I was hesitating just becuz I had spent so much money on hair styling tools  but then everytime my hair dresser use it on me I wanted it more so I bought it, it works beyond great, I love it, i got it for a great price, it heats up quick and stays hot, the size is great at first I thought it was a little smaller then what im use too but I actually got use to it and I actually like it this size, Its great for any hair type too, I would recommend it to everyone and just knowing that my hair dresser has the same exact one and she uses it on everyone makes me feel good, now thats what I call a good investment.  Lol</li>
    <li> Is ok, is not that hot as is written at the lable.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my straightner!</li>
    <li> It was great and the real item!</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to this one, but I like it.  My primary issue with some of the hair appliances on the market today is not being able to see significant differences from the pricey ones and the drugstore models.  So, is it worth a hundred bucks?  Not so sure.</li>
    <li> After trying my friend&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s Babyliss, my daughters and I now have two of these straighteners and absolutely love them both.</li>
    <li> Terrible!!!!!!! I need change or my money back</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Flat Iron.  I can control the temperature and not cause heat damage to my texlaxed hair.  It was well worth the money I spent.</li>
    <li> I have went through many many many hair straightners over the years. Since I have thick hair that&#x27;s not either curly or straight, just somewhere in the messy middle, its always been hard for me to find a flat iron that works for me. I decided to try the babybliss and I absolutely loved it!! My hair has never felt so soft &amp; smooth. Its light and small, but works fantastic. It heats up very quickly and when using it I only have to go over  a strand once. I recommend this to anyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> as promised and expected. good item good price on time will recommend him again. keep up good work. yhabk you</li>
    <li> I love it..it works better then any straightener I&#x27;ve ever had!!! Heats up really fast..has different levels of temperature... It&#x27;s small and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great Price too! I would definitely recommend this product. This is the exact straightening Iron my hair dresser uses, and it works great for me and my daughter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many straighteners this is far the best one ever. Love the way my hair feels after. Super straight and silky</li>
    <li> Love this product! Gentle on hire and works great. Service was also great.</li>
    <li> The iron was much smaller than I anticipated, but the more I use it the more I really like the smaller size!  It&#x27;s light weight, has multiple heat settings and gets hot (and stays hot) quick.  I&#x27;ve owned many flat irons in the past and I think this one beats a Chi!  Highly recommend to anyone!</li>
