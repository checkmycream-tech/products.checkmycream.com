      <li>pleased your still selling it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
      <li>&quot; I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>and I just love the smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a shame, because the scent could have been great for all seasons and all occasions.</li>
      <li>I was absolutely pleased with this scent.</li>
      <li>I loved the smell so much that I went out and bought one for myself to use as a room and linen refresher spray.</li>
      <li>SUCH GOOD SCENTS!  </li>
      <li>more of a japanese car fan, but this scent is great.</li>
      <li>not too strong not too light but manly.</li>
      <li>The metal container was damaged, and the box it was sent in was heavily damaged but the cologne itself was in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>Definitely my new favorite and will order it more often</li>
      <li>are familiar with this now as \\&quot;my</li>
      <li>It is very manly and stays on, the smell does not fade is 20, 30 minutes like most brands.</li>
      <li>Would recommend to any male that likes to smell good.</li>
      <li>the title is cool too... mustang.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>The price was great for such a big bottle.</li>
      <li>Wonderful dry down as well.</li>
      <li>My mother got this for me the first time.</li>
      <li>This is my best kept secret for a cologne!</li>
      <li>When it runs low, I will definatley be coming to this seller to buy more.</li>
      <li>I finally was able to find it.</li>
      <li>And he loves Ford so he was extra excited!</li>
      <li>and I was amazed at how large the bottle was.</li>
      <li>I really like the smell on this colone.</li>
      <li>this smells very manly if that&#x27;s the word to use.</li>
      <li>Price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I had the smaller bottle originally which I used for probably 3 years</li>
      <li>Smells great, I have bought several bottles in the past.</li>
      <li>I still have that original 1-ounce bottle of blue, but the black I&#x27;ve bought many times since.</li>
      <li>They used to sell this cologne at Wal Mart and stopped carrying it alltogether where we live.</li>
      <li>This is much cheaper than Kohl&#x27;s, so if you are going to buy this cologne, I would definitely recommend going the Amazon route.</li>
      <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long but, for the price, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>This is a clean manly scent that I actually would perfer to wear everyday.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have to use much so a bottle last a long time.  </li>
      <li>Not Drakar Noir, though it&#x27;s not hugely distant from that scent.</li>
      <li>Never too over-powering to choke people and not too mild to fade away in a few short hours.</li>
      <li>Whether that&#x27;s a good or bad thing, I don&#x27;t know, but they continue to hang around me</li>

<li> I ordered this cologne for my fiance, about no more than two days ago.</li>
<li> Concepts\\&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure what that means, or if it means anything.</li>
<li> Should last a long while and keep me from blowing money on extra, unneeded crap in a Gordman&#x27;s store somewhere!</li>
<li> he&#x27;s a mustang fanatic</li>
<li> It is next to impossible to find (rather than online).</li>
<li> I have literally never had a single person say my cologne smells bad.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not great smelling</li>
<li> but now i think ill switch to this cologne</li>
<li> so I guess it can&#x27;t be too bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice n smooth dealing</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere when trying to buy this not online, I finally resorted to amazon and it came within 4 days!! The price was great for such a big bottle. Super impressed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne for my fiance, about no more than two days ago. It got all the way from NJ to cali in that time. :) Very pleased with it, it smells delicious!! It is next to impossible to find (rather than online). It&#x27;s a very good price for the product. Will be ordering this again! :)</li>
    <li> Prompt service and love the smell:)</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Cologne is perfect,  great price.</li>
    <li> If this scent were sold in a Burberry bottle it would  be a bestseller. An amazing, complex, and deep scent that stays and projects like crazy. I&#x27;m a woman but I bought this for my brother. I loved the smell so much that I went out and bought one for myself to use as a room and linen refresher spray.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell on this colone. I have used it for years. Don&#x27;t have to use much so a bottle last a long time.  Can&#x27;t find it anywhere but Amazon.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for quite some time now and I just love the smell. Not a fan of mustang cars at all.. more of a japanese car fan, but this scent is great. If nissan or honda made a cologne and it smelled better I would probably wear that tho.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing business with Blossom Concepts for over a year, they have always had a great product!!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase in the future!</li>
    <li> They used to sell this cologne at Wal Mart and stopped carrying it alltogether where we live. The cologne itself is an awesome scent. Resembles a polo blue/black smell, not a musk smell. The box it comes in is tin so when the cologne is gone its a great collector&#x27;s box for mustang enthusiasts.</li>
    <li> Smells great, I have bought several bottles in the past.</li>
    <li> SUCH GOOD SCENTS!  I LOVE IT ON MY MAN!</li>
    <li> smells great on my husband... he&#x27;s a mustang fanatic so that&#x27;s why i bought it for him... however smells smell different on different people.</li>
    <li> Great price and free shipping!!! This was a birthday gift for my brother-in-law who could no longer find his favorite cologne in stores</li>
    <li> My son in law loves this</li>
    <li> My boyfriend smells amazing! And he loves Ford so he was extra excited!</li>
    <li> Thanks my friend feel happy.</li>
    <li> Great smelling men&#x27;s cologne&lt;br /&gt;One of th best&lt;br /&gt;Great gift for the men in your life&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased your still selling it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Just received this cologne and it smells perfect. I have received many compliments on how great it smells. Price was reasonable. I had to try it because I own a Ford Mustang.</li>
    <li> Get compliments all the time</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised</li>
    <li> I found this is a sears store a couple years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it again. Amazon has everything!  It is very manly and stays on, the smell does not fade is 20, 30 minutes like most brands. This one will last all night.</li>
    <li> good.  this smells very manly if that&#x27;s the word to use. not too strong not too light but manly. the title is cool too... mustang.</li>
    <li> has a great price for it and i get compliments on how i smell all the time, i use to use axe body spray but now i think ill switch to this cologne</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments from the ladies and that they love the smell of it. Definitely my new favorite and will order it more often</li>
    <li> This is my husband car cologne.  he likes it.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for me in the past as a novelty gift when I drove a Mustang. I since have sold the &#x27;stang and re-ordered this cologne. Very nice and unique smell at a great price.</li>
    <li> Ive always loved this colonge&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> My mother got this for me the first time. I have never gone back. I love mustangs and having this is awesome. It has a great scent that always gets complimented</li>
    <li> Lasts me a long time! I had the smaller bottle originally which I used for probably 3 years (I don&#x27;t wear it that often). Got this larger one now and the only downside I can find is that it is larger than the 3-ounce max you can bring in carry-on on a plane. May have to improvise on my next trip!</li>
    <li> Great smell and great price,would buy again</li>
    <li> I started wearing Mustang about a year or two back when I ran across a small bottle at a Gordman&#x27;s or Kohl&#x27;s or some such store. I bought both the blue and the black. I still have that original 1-ounce bottle of blue, but the black I&#x27;ve bought many times since. It reminds me of a cologne that I wore as a teenager, though I cannot remember which one that was. Not Drakar Noir, though it&#x27;s not hugely distant from that scent. Anyway, I like it and those who know me are familiar with this now as \\&quot;my scent,\\&quot; I&#x27;m sure. Whether that&#x27;s a good or bad thing, I don&#x27;t know, but they continue to hang around me so I guess it can&#x27;t be too bad. (Nevermind that many of them are on my payroll and have no choice.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I&#x27;d recommend it. When I found the larger bottles on amazon, I bought 3. Should last a long while and keep me from blowing money on extra, unneeded crap in a Gordman&#x27;s store somewhere!</li>
    <li> I was absolutely pleased with this scent. It was remarkable. Wonderful dry down as well. Unfortunately, once the top and some of the midnotes wear off, the projection goes down to skin level (about one hour). From there on out, it stays at skin level. It&#x27;s really a shame, because the scent could have been great for all seasons and all occasions. Just a wonderful, versatile, masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am partly wondering if it is a brand thing. This cologne is supposed to be Estee Lauder / Aramis, or simply by Mustang. For whatever reason, this is \\&quot;Blossom Concepts\\&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure what that means, or if it means anything. I can&#x27;t get any information on it.</li>
    <li> This is a clean manly scent that I actually would perfer to wear everyday.  It lasts the entire day and I even smell it after being home from a day out.  The ladies love the scent which is a plus.  i have noticed I get followed in the grocery when i wear it..</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne and got it in 5 days, which was wonderful! I chose the 3.4 oz and I was amazed at how large the bottle was. This cologne smells wonderful and is a great gift. The metal container was damaged, and the box it was sent in was heavily damaged but the cologne itself was in perfect condition. Could have just been a problem with UPS. When it runs low, I will definatley be coming to this seller to buy more.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne. Is it my favorite? No, but since he likes it, I buy it for him. This is much cheaper than Kohl&#x27;s, so if you are going to buy this cologne, I would definitely recommend going the Amazon route.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s favorite. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Smells great, good price, nice packaging, and mine came pretty fast as well.</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing. I have women raving about how great I smell whenever they&#x27;re around me. I have literally never had a single person say my cologne smells bad. I put about 1.5 sprays on myself, and I am good for the day. Never too over-powering to choke people and not too mild to fade away in a few short hours. This is my best kept secret for a cologne! Nobody wears it (at all!), and every lady loves the smell. Perfect!</li>
    <li> have had several compliments on this cologne. Would recommend to any male that likes to smell good. This is my third bottle and will buy again</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with purchase and delivery.</li>
    <li> I finally was able to find it. The other Mustang now sold by internet perfume companies (with the checked bottle cap) is not the same. This is so much better!</li>
    <li> The product was said to come in 3-5 days so I took a chance, hoping it would make it by Christmas. It came in in time, and was a perfect gift!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend.  It&#x27;s not great smelling but it&#x27;s o.k.  The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long but, for the price, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
