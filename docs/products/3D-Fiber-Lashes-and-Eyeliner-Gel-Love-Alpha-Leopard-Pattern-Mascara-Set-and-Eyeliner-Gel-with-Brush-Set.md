      <li>Love the way this makes my eyelashes look grear product</li>
      <li>I love this fiber mascara</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>good, and great quality, i would definitely purchase with them</li>
      <li>Will defiantly be ordering more.</li>
      <li>Love, love love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought some for $2.00 that work better.</li>
      <li>Love Alpha doesn&#x27;t suggest that additional step</li>
      <li>Works exactly the way it is supposed to and makes my lashes and eyes look glamorous and amazing!</li>
      <li>However, Love Alpha&#x27;s price is under $8 and Younique&#x27;s is $29.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this 2 step lash extensions mascara.</li>
      <li>The first couple times I used the mascara, it looked good, but after that it looked almost like I had none on.</li>
      <li>This was my first gel eyeliner ever, but I loved the pigment &amp;</li>
      <li>sure how easy it removes yet</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>While I like the end result and easy removal, I am noticing that my lashes are getting sparser.  </li>
      <li>how easy it applied.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have the patience to wait a month for shipping (like me), buy the one available through Prime, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
      <li>and I could tell a significant difference in thickness.</li>
      <li>this by far is the best and it only cost me 12.99!</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick and everything was just as the description &amp; picture showed.</li>
      <li>then it will come right off.</li>
      <li>A little time consuming to apply to get perfect but with practice I can get the look of full, long lashes.  </li>
      <li>Shipped fast as always!</li>
      <li>I would recommend trying Tarte first.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it promises.</li>
      <li>This was my first time applying, I also used the eyeliner it came with</li>
      <li>My husband even noticed within the first time wearing it.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty fond of it, too.</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend :)</li>
      <li>The other thing is that with Younique&#x27;s it is recommended that you use your own mascara first followed by their transplanting gel</li>
      <li>I highly recommend trying this product if you&#x27;re looking for long and full lashes.</li>
      <li>The first initial applications caused my eyes to burn...maybe I was getting too close to the root of my lashes, but now I have no problems.  </li>
      <li>Made my short, straight Asian lashes so much longer</li>
      <li>After using it for awhile I did compare it to my old mascara</li>
      <li>Really doesn&#x27;t help eyelashes look any different then reg mascara!!</li>
      <li>While it adds a little extra time to my daily makeup routine I do love it.</li>
      <li>But exactly what I expected when purchasing.  </li>
      <li>but I did notice a big difference with using this than normal mascara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this mascara for two weeks now and I won&#x27;t be going back to my old stuff.</li>
      <li>Also my eyelashes were soft unlike when you cake a ton of regular mascara on.</li>
      <li>The eye liner is a little hard to get off but still love it!</li>
      <li>and I absolutely have to put this mascara/fibers on first and let dry for a few minutes and then put on my contacts.  </li>

    <li> Love the way this makes my eyelashes look grear product</li>
    <li> Simply an amazing product. Love, love love it. It does exactly what it promises. Will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It leaves little fibers all over my eyes but I did notice a big difference with using this than normal mascara.</li>
    <li> Omg...this stuff works....great price...and cool looking container. Stuff is hard to get off.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim because I wanted to try fiber lash mascara. It is AMAZING. Seriously, it&#x27;s beautiful, goes on easily, looks amazing, and has gotten many compliments. The Eyeliner gel is also great. I usually am awful with applying it but it&#x27;s very smooth and nice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for two weeks now and I won&#x27;t be going back to my old stuff. I gave it three stars though because I don&#x27;t feel like it makes my lashes longer, however it definitely makes them fuller. After using it for awhile I did compare it to my old mascara and I could tell a significant difference in thickness. While it adds a little extra time to my daily makeup routine I do love it.</li>
    <li> Really doesn&#x27;t help eyelashes look any different then reg mascara!! Disappointed</li>
    <li> I love it. It works great! The eye liner is a little hard to get off but still love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. Will defiantly be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Great product my eyelashes were maximized. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Got to me in one day and I&#x27;m from California! Amazing. Made my short, straight Asian lashes so much longer and I didn&#x27;t even have to curl my lashes. I can&#x27;t even imagine what it would look like curled! I&#x27;ve been wasting money on drugstores mascara for too long!</li>
    <li> I was scared to buy this product due to reading bad reviews and I guess it depends who you are I love this fiber mascara I will never use another store bought mascara two thumbs up</li>
    <li> One of the best fiber mascara is I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve tried many of them very expensive ones and this by far is the best and it only cost me 12.99! The other day my mom asked me if I got eyelash extensions and I told her no it&#x27;s just his brand-new mascara that I&#x27;ve been using! For me it doesn&#x27;t leave all those black little flakes underneath my eyes I guess I just know how to do it properly!</li>
    <li> I loved this! This was my first time applying, I also used the eyeliner it came with and I&#x27;m pretty fond of it, too. My husband even noticed within the first time wearing it.  (:&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how easy it removes yet but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try! Hope this helped!</li>
    <li> Love this 2 step lash extensions mascara. I have used Younique&#x27;s extension mascara and have loved it as well. However, Love Alpha&#x27;s price is under $8 and Younique&#x27;s is $29. Plus I am almost obnoxious when it comes to leopard print so I love the tubes of Love Alpha&#x27;s mascara. The other thing is that with Younique&#x27;s it is recommended that you use your own mascara first followed by their transplanting gel then the fiber lash extensions making it a 3 step process. Love Alpha doesn&#x27;t suggest that additional step so it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s only 2 steps cutting down a few minutes on your application time. I highly recommend trying this product if you&#x27;re looking for long and full lashes. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> i got impressed when i used this, because i thought they were not as seller said, but it is... they are amazing... good, and great quality, i would definitely purchase with them</li>
    <li> love this product and now my friends are hooked!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!!!!!!!!! I was skeptical at first after seeing tons of fiber lash review, but I had no issues. I applied a thin layer of regular mascara, one layer of gel then fiber, repeat, then sealed it in with regular mascara again. No issues at all &amp; it lasts all day! Also my eyelashes were soft unlike when you cake a ton of regular mascara on. I love the price too! This was my first gel eyeliner ever, but I loved the pigment &amp; how easy it applied. Washing off is easier than regular mascara as well, just wet a washcloth &amp; press on eyelashes to moisten then it will come right off. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve never bought the more expensive, name brand version of fiber lashes, I think this is very similar for a fraction of the cost.  A little time consuming to apply to get perfect but with practice I can get the look of full, long lashes.  They look like false lashes which may or may not be what your looking for... But exactly what I expected when purchasing.  Shipped fast as always!</li>
    <li> This product does give you thicker, fuller lashes but the fibers that fall under my eyes are a nuisance.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive ones and I like this one better! Definitely recommend :)</li>
    <li> The first initial applications caused my eyes to burn...maybe I was getting too close to the root of my lashes, but now I have no problems.  I would say its critical that you also use a lash brush to remove clumps, separate lashes and to remove excess fibers.  I wear contacts and I absolutely have to put this mascara/fibers on first and let dry for a few minutes and then put on my contacts.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now.  While I like the end result and easy removal, I am noticing that my lashes are getting sparser.  Overall, it does make your lashes look longer.</li>
    <li> Works so well. The fibers don&#x27;t get all over my cheeks. Great product!</li>
    <li> The first couple times I used the mascara, it looked good, but after that it looked almost like I had none on. I did not like the eyeliner. I&#x27;ve bought some for $2.00 that work better. For the same price almost an upscale brand, Tarte Cosmetics, has fiber mascara. I wish I had known beforehand. I would recommend trying Tarte first.</li>
    <li> Loved this product.  Shipping was quick and everything was just as the description &amp; picture showed. Will definitely buy this again.  Made lashes extended.  Easy to apply.  Loved the gel eyeliner too</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This mascara and eyeliner is amazing. I will never use regular mascara again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Love Alpha Fiber Lashes and Eyeliner!  This is the best product EVER!  Works exactly the way it is supposed to and makes my lashes and eyes look glamorous and amazing!</li>
    <li> Product works as it is advertised, but fibers fall into your eyes and irritation causes your eyes to water.</li>
    <li> This mascara has met all of my expectations. I am super super impressed and pleased with this product. It applies smoothly and looks great after application. I plan on buying quite a few sets of this just in case I run out. If you don&#x27;t have the patience to wait a month for shipping (like me), buy the one available through Prime, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
