<li> it&#x27;s small folks 4oz as advertised.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s very messy.</li>
<li> it came in on time at least</li>
<li> Not good at all</li>
<li> I find that this product does what it says, but is rather expensive.</li>
<li> and it didn&#x27;t wipe off with mere sweat &amp; lasted abut 5-6 days.</li>
<li> Worst than a Jerry curl!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Runs a bit more than the Topsol.</li>
    <li> Works great and looks natural in helping cover up thinning hair. I will be ordering another can when my current one runs out!</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this product from my barber and had great results.  When I ran out I opted to cut the middle man out and order on line.  It was runny and did not do the trick.  Won&#x27;t be ordering from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> awsome for quick line ups before going out, or going to school. Make sure you take a sweat rag with you in case you start sweating it doesn&#x27;t run down.</li>
    <li> Ehhh not worth it came in on time at least</li>
    <li> Not good at all I don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> Well! it&#x27;s dose help with hiding ball spots. But it&#x27;s very messy. It gets everywhere!</li>
    <li> Very good product, I would recommend it to all those with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This product worked great</li>
    <li> Works as described but it will ruin your bed sheets and clothing if it gets on them! It WILL stain your stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Very easy to use, and the can usually last for at least 3-4 months. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It has good coverage.  Downside is that it stains your linens (pillowcases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only using it until my hair grows out.  Almost there.</li>
    <li> It worked wonders on my husbands thinning spots along his hairline and it didn&#x27;t wipe off with mere sweat &amp; lasted abut 5-6 days.</li>
    <li> My barber out of the blue asked me to try the Black ice touch up on my hair. He applied it to my hair approx. 3 months ago. Needless to say I fell in love with the product. I use it to cover up certain grey spots and thin spots. When applied it certainly provides a natural wonderful look. I&#x27;m ordering more today. To help avoid any rubbing off of product onto my pillow case I first apply a light mist of hair hold spray. Immediately afterward I spray the black ice touch up. Immediately following I lightly  mist my hair again with the hair hold spray. Bam!!  there you have it . Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This product worked pretty good. It&#x27;s like spray paint on your head and can be messy throughout the day. Not bad.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I feel new again.</li>

    <li> Its only one word to describe it awesome;im really enjoying my new product.ive definitely told all my friends about this one it really works</li>
    <li> Great product! Fresh lining every time.</li>
    <li> Definitely a five star. Because of recent hair lost&lt;br /&gt;and receding hair line, it fills in the areas I&#x27;m most concerned about. The time it saves me to do my hair, and to walk out the door with renewed confidence,  is priceless!</li>
    <li> This is my third time ordering this product and I love it I&#x27;m going to order one each month</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I wish I knew of it earlier because this Black Ice is great!</li>
    <li> Keep your hair cut low, it works wonderfully</li>
    <li> works great, just what I needed, just use dark pillow cases,,cost was too high, yes I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he LOVES it.  I will be purchasing more and I&#x27;m sure he will too!</li>
    <li> Good just wanted to try something different this is a good product. Will buy again .great for hair cuts. Thanks</li>
    <li> For what I paid for this. I really did think the can was going to be much bigger. But my husband cuts hair on the side and he really needed this . So that&#x27;s why I got it. I works really love if u all could get bigger cans .</li>
    <li> Black ice is very effective its a good product to use on thinning hair it makes hair fuller  it looks good very good look on a black man truly</li>
    <li> Great buy, great deal, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Shipped quick. Spray is great and holds through sweat.</li>

    <li> Very good,,,everything i expectorad</li>
    <li> Dont lay your head on anything white, will stain. Worst than a Jerry curl!:) I&#x27;m just saying.&lt;br /&gt;Will not recommend .</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money. Gets all over your pillow cases when u sleep. Will not buy this again</li>
    <li> Good stuff!! Fast shipping!! Good for giving a crisp lining after a hair cut! This is every barbers must have if u want every client happy every time!</li>
    <li> gotta have it if your going out and want a sharp line and your thining out on the top - all barbers should have this tool. Its a little pricey but well worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Works great just doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some kind of spray on bald spot concealer that will not rub off too easily.  I searched Youtube and saw a few to choose from.  The vids for Black Ice showed barbers using the product on their clients.  I liked the results I saw so I ordered a can.  I got the product days before expected delivery and cost was great.  I like the product and one on can tell I sprayed anything on to conceal my thinning hair area and bald spot.  Trust me; ((( the best way to get the best results is to lightly spray some on a black brush))) and brush it throughout your hair to cover grey hair also.  Any over spray on the hairline can be simply wiped off and lined up using a piece of paper towel and alcohol.  To set the spray in place to lessen any rubbing off  is to use any brand of Super Hold Hair Spray the mist kind and not the wet gel and lightly spray all over your head.  Anyone can use this, male, female of any race.  With some trail and error you will get the hang of it and like it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.. A little costly for a small can but its worth it in the end. It darkens the hair just right and makes the hairline flawless</li>
    <li> Works good for covering thinning areas of hair with a natural look. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for covering large areas but for my thinning corners it does the job well.</li>

    <li> It makes the cut come alive definitely a money maker when you want to improved your skills in the barber game.</li>
    <li> Very well! Item received on time. Will continue to purchase. Thanks!</li>
    <li> My order was on time no complaints. the packaging of my product was good overall keep up the good service.</li>
    <li> I have a bald spot that has progressively gotten more noticeable. I am still too young to shave my head however this product is great. I conceals the area and looks like you just dyed your hair .</li>
    <li> I find that this product does what it says, but is rather expensive. Especially if one were to use it daily.</li>
    <li> Does the job... after a fresh cut...it makes the edges extra sharp and crisp! ..</li>
    <li> Good, satisfied with the purchase a little smaller than imagined overall good product.&lt;br /&gt;P.s. use latex gloves when applying</li>
    <li> Black Ice is an excellent touch up spray! I use it on my thinning sides, good for men and women.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job but the can is soooo small for the price. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake i did and assume or look at the deceiving size of  the pic. it&#x27;s small folks 4oz as advertised.</li>
