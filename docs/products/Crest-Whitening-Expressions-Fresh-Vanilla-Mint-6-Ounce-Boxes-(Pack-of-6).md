      <li>Nice, mellow flavor that will leave your mouth feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>This is my son&#x27;s favorite toothpaste and I can&#x27;t find it in any store anymore.  </li>
      <li>When I stopped being able to find it at the stores, I started buying it online.</li>
      <li>You find mostly mint flavored pastes and maybe a cinnamon flavor here or there.  </li>
      <li>so I was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so bummed that I might not be able to have any more of this toothpaste, and will have to now search for another brand, many of which I&#x27;ve tried before and didn&#x27;t like.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about 4 years, and I love</li>
      <li>When I stopped being able to find it in the States, I discovered it in a Canadian drugstore.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re more adventurous, get this 6-pack.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I can get it here -</li>
      <li>Hope they get some more in so</li>
      <li>a mother could love...</li>
      <li>Most toothpaste out there is so strong it will knock-your-socks-off.</li>
      <li>When Colgate discontinued the very mild mint gel toothpaste that I&#x27;d used for over 10 years I went on a search for a replacement.</li>
      <li>Not only will you keep your teeth and gums healthy, but it also tastes great.  </li>
      <li>An important but often overlooked part of scent control is elimating breath odors.  </li>
      <li>Great toothpaste which is mild and not so domestic with the mint taste.    </li>
      <li>Cleans my teeth and keeps them feeling clean.</li>
      <li>It does a nice job of keeping my teeth white and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Check reviews all over the net, and you&#x27;ll find that EVERYBODY absolutely loved this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>seriously though I wish Crest would still make this the best tasting toothpaste ever....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m convinced that it has contributed to my success in getting close to deer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a mint that stings your mouth, although it might wreck the taste of orange juice if you drink it right after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>have been buying this toothpaste since it first was introduced.</li>
      <li>Thanks for keeping this in stock Amazon!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll last you a year or more I&#x27;m guessing.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon, I can purchase this because none of the stores anywhere in the San Fernando Valley carry this flavor anymore!</li>
      <li>sure enough I found the toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve never tried it, I&#x27;ll bet you like it, but go get a tube at the store to try first to test it out before you buy in bulk.</li>
      <li>Crest, you really screwed up.  </li>
      <li>I dislike mint but really didn&#x27;t have a choice when it came to toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>, I really dont understand why since everybody on the internet is writing about how much they want the flavor</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know much about marketing</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I enjoy it because it has a different flavor than most other toothpastes.  </li>
      <li>Basically, it&#x27;s a mild enough flavor that I don&#x27;t really think of it at all when I go to brush.</li>
      <li>Finally I found it on Amazon and order a lot of it right away.    </li>
      <li>I always hated super minty toothpaste and this is the best flavor by far!     </li>
      <li>Amazon should probably link to the new toothpaste from the old listings.</li>
      <li>I also enjoy the flavor enough to use everyday.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I find that no other toothpaste compares to it.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised and now only use this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like anything spicy/hot, and other toothpastes burn my mouth.  </li>
      <li>I loved this toothpaste and was disappointed when they discontinued it but rejoice for Crest has come out with a new Vanilla Mint toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>

<li> I personally don&#x27;t taste mint, but it&#x27;s not straight, overpowering Vanilla either.    </li>
<li> Vanilla extract has long been used as a cover scent because the smell of vanilla does NOT alarm deer.  </li>

<li> Why is it so hard to find and buy?</li>
<li> I never really liked all the toothpastes out there, as they are almost all mint.  </li>
<li> The weird thing is you can&#x27;t find it at Amazon Canada.</li>
<li> It seems unlikely that ALL the retailers mentioned in these reviews have decided to stop carrying this product.</li>

<li> Sorry, I almost forgot I was talking about tooth paste.</li>
<li> Some might find it weird that vanilla would be in a tooth paste but trust me, it works.</li>
<li> Are you going to get sick of it after one tube?</li>

    <li> This is just the Crest Whitening Expressions that everyone knows and trusts but vanilla flavored.  I dislike mint but really didn&#x27;t have a choice when it came to toothpaste.  You find mostly mint flavored pastes and maybe a cinnamon flavor here or there.  When I saw the vanilla flavor I bought it immediately.  The box states vanilla mint but I don&#x27;t notice the mint.  And it&#x27;s Crest so it cleans my teeth very nicely as a toothpaste with Crest printed on the box should.  I did start noticing it harder to find at drugstores so I checked trusty Amazon and sure enough I found the toothpaste.  Plus with the six tubes in the pack I&#x27;m happily set for awhile.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Amazon, I can purchase this because none of the stores anywhere in the San Fernando Valley carry this flavor anymore!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that they are discontinuing this best flavor toothpaste ever made!  I had to buy a few cases before they are gone forever!</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite toothpaste, but the stores around me have stopped carrying it!  I enjoy it because it has a different flavor than most other toothpastes.  I don&#x27;t really like anything spicy/hot, and other toothpastes burn my mouth.  I have actually used kid flavors in the past because adult flavors are too spicy.  This one is not, and I actually feel like a grown-up now!  It does a nice job of keeping my teeth white and healthy.  Five stars!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this toothpaste on a cruise ship. I did not want to sample because I didn&#x27;t think a vanilla flavored toothpaste would be clean-feeling in my mouth. I was pleasantly surprised and now only use this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste.  Not only will you keep your teeth and gums healthy, but it also tastes great.  Have had good checkups with my dentist, so it works well from his end too!  Nice, mellow flavor that will leave your mouth feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> I never really liked all the toothpastes out there, as they are almost all mint.  I was using the Crest Cinnamon one, until this came out.   It&#x27;s a very light, but pleasant flavor.  I personally don&#x27;t taste mint, but it&#x27;s not straight, overpowering Vanilla either.    Unfortunately, it is getting hard to find on local shelves, so I&#x27;m stocking up in case they drop it!</li>
    <li> When Colgate discontinued the very mild mint gel toothpaste that I&#x27;d used for over 10 years I went on a search for a replacement. When I found this vanilla mint it was perfect! Most toothpaste out there is so strong it will knock-your-socks-off. The vanilla mint has a very pleasant mild mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying this toothpaste since it first was introduced. I&#x27;ve always found it in the supermarket or at Target. In the last couple of months I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. I went to the Crest website to see if it was discontinued and found that Amazon sold it. It was a nice surprise and I bought 12 tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know much about marketing but I can&#x27;t figure out why I can&#x27;t buy this toothpaste in the store any longer. After reading other reviews I see I&#x27;m not alone. It seems unlikely that ALL the retailers mentioned in these reviews have decided to stop carrying this product. This must be something the Crest company is doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I can get it here - for as long as it lasts.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I find that no other toothpaste compares to it. When I stopped being able to find it at the stores, I started buying it online. Yet now, it seems like it&#x27;s been good and truly discontinued. I can&#x27;t find it in stock anywhere, and I&#x27;ve hunted all over the internet!! Why was it discontinued?? Check reviews all over the net, and you&#x27;ll find that EVERYBODY absolutely loved this toothpaste. Why would they discontinue something so wonderful? I&#x27;m so bummed that I might not be able to have any more of this toothpaste, and will have to now search for another brand, many of which I&#x27;ve tried before and didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I agree that this is the best toothpaste. When I stopped being able to find it in the States, I discovered it in a Canadian drugstore. For some reason, Crest seems to think Canadians like it and Americans don&#x27;t. The weird thing is you can&#x27;t find it at Amazon Canada. I don&#x27;t get that. The price here is 3 times as expensive as a regular tube of toothpaste. But boy does it make my mouth feel good!</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste!  I actually look forward to brushing due to the vanilla flavor.  I noticed a few canker sores develop however, when I used this product exclusively.  Alternating this with another brand eliminates the problem.  It would be great to see this in a gel.</li>
    <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite toothpaste and I can&#x27;t find it in any store anymore.  I was really glad to find it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this toothpaste in stores anymore so I was glad to find it on Amazon.  My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked vanilla,so I tried this and I liked it,Crest Whitening Expressions Fresh Vanilla Mint,leaves a nice,clean taste in yout mouth after brushing.rememeber to floss and mouthwash!!! My nephews like it too!!! A+</li>
    <li> The best flavor ever!! Cleans my teeth and keeps them feeling clean. Hope they get some more in so I can buy some soon.</li>
    <li> The stores in my area are no longer carrying this flavor and I don&#x27;t know why. Some might find it weird that vanilla would be in a tooth paste but trust me, it works. The vanilla cuts down on the harshness of the mint. Look, chocolate and mint go together so why not vanilla and mint?? I would eat cookies and cakes and candies with this combination. Oh yeah....it does a great job of cleaning your teeth AND it doesn&#x27;t burn. Sorry, I almost forgot I was talking about tooth paste. As an added bonus, my coffee or breakfast food doesn&#x27;t taste too weird after brushing my teeth with this. Just try it!! I think any one will be pleasantly surprised at this subtle flavor and when you can&#x27;t find it locally either, LET THOSE GUYS KNOW!. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is the Best Flavor Toothpaste EVER! But they Discontinued it, I really dont understand why since everybody on the internet is writing about how much they want the flavor back.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully Crest will be reading this and will think about bringing it back at least for a limited time!</li>
    <li> Someone&#x27;s said it before and I agree: this toothpaste has a very mild and pleasant flavor. It&#x27;s not a mint that stings your mouth, although it might wreck the taste of orange juice if you drink it right after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the flavor is good. Are you going to get sick of it after one tube? I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for 3 years. Basically, it&#x27;s a mild enough flavor that I don&#x27;t really think of it at all when I go to brush. I don&#x27;t think of brushing my teeth as \\&quot;oh I&#x27;m going to taste my vanilla mint toothpaste.\\&quot; I just forget about the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never tried it, I&#x27;ll bet you like it, but go get a tube at the store to try first to test it out before you buy in bulk. If you&#x27;re more adventurous, get this 6-pack. It&#x27;ll last you a year or more I&#x27;m guessing.</li>
    <li> I just Crest the last time I was in the US and since than.    I asked my mother to buy it for me, but she couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.    Finally I found it on Amazon and order a lot of it right away.    Great toothpaste which is mild and not so domestic with the mint taste.    Why is it so hard to find and buy?</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re trying to get within bow range of whitetail, you must fool their noses.  An important but often overlooked part of scent control is elimating breath odors.  Vanilla extract has long been used as a cover scent because the smell of vanilla does NOT alarm deer.  I have used this vanilla flavored toothpaste for the last three deer seasons.  I&#x27;m convinced that it has contributed to my success in getting close to deer.  I also enjoy the flavor enough to use everyday.  Much more pleasant than baking soda.</li>
    <li> I am back here to order my 2nd order of the toothpaste.  I can no longer find it in any stores in the Twin Cities, MN. I always hated super minty toothpaste and this is the best flavor by far!     Thanks for keeping this in stock Amazon!</li>
    <li> I loved this toothpaste and was disappointed when they discontinued it but rejoice for Crest has come out with a new Vanilla Mint toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Look up Crest Be Inspired Vanilla Mint Spark Flavor Toothpaste and be happy. Amazon should probably link to the new toothpaste from the old listings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about 4 years, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Why would they ever stop producing this is beyond my understanding.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for kids graduating to adult toothpaste.  Crest, you really screwed up.  Think it over again.  Market it for the kids.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, follow directions an voila!!  clean teeth an gums plus wonderful breath a mother could love... It&#x27;s TOOTHPATSE PEOPLE!!!  seriously though I wish Crest would still make this the best tasting toothpaste ever.... Buy it. Oh wait you cant they discontinued it.... Sorrey</li>
