      <li>An old ointment from back in the day this stuff is great for healing everything from pimples to poison ivy.</li>
      <li>My family has been using Resinol for years, on 22 years worth of babies, and there is just nothing comparable.</li>
      <li>Our young nephews love because it doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This ointment is great!  I started using it about 20 yrs ago for diaper rash.  It works better than anything on the market!  Also it is great for so many other things.  It is great on insect bites and minor skin iritations.  I use it on ant bites as soon as they occur and they never fester up or itch.</li>
    <li> Use for rashes works great!</li>
    <li> Works like no other cream.  I have four kids and have used it with all of them.</li>
    <li> I purchased two jars of this item because it is hard to find.  It is not exactly as I remember from my childhood but it still does the trick.  Heals irratated skin in a couple of days and provides immediate relief.</li>
    <li> Great for diaper rash</li>
    <li> There is NO better medication on the market for chafing. Anyone that works in an enviornment that is very hot and has this problem, this stuff works the best. Have been using it for over 35 years.</li>
    <li> THE MERCHANT I ORDERED FROM WAS FAST AND CORRECT.  WILL DEFINITELY ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I have resinol  for years. good for lots of skin irritations</li>
    <li> good ointment and can use for diaper rash</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve have used Resinol for years. It is great for burns, including sunburns, and especially burning baby bottoms. We threw out the &#x27;Desitin&#x27;, &#x27;Balmex&#x27;, and &#x27;Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste&#x27; long ago. No comparison.</li>
    <li> Raised in this wonderful stuff.  Great for man or beast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of ailements, starting with diaper rash and this product has never let me down!</li>
    <li> better than any other over the counter brands. i had skin irritation. i applied \\&quot;Neosporin\\&quot;. it didn&#x27;t do much. then i applied \\&quot;Resinol\\&quot; ointment before i went to sleep. when i woke up in the next morning, the skin irritation subdued and went away in 3 days. it is just a better product than anything i had tried and seen. its formulation is also very effective in healing small wounds, minor cuts &amp; scrapes. throw out \\&quot;Neosporin\\&quot; and stock up on \\&quot;Resinol\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> It is not the old Resinol but it still works great.  The manufacturer claims only the odor was removed.  I can&#x27;t find any other first aid product that is as good.</li>
    <li> Shipping was timely and amazingly wrapped. I would use them again.Product is good but not in my opinion great.</li>
    <li> Resinol is, without a doubt, the best skin treatment available.  I first learned about it from my sister-in-law shortly our oldest daughter was born.  She told us that her parents (a pharmacist father and R/N mother) had used it for among other uses, diaper rash with all their kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it, with our kids, we were believers too.  Even the most severe diaper rash, with blistering, never took more than two days to completely clear up with resinol.  It literally works like magic.  A minor diaper rash is gone in hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on myself for almost any skin issue, including sunburn, minor burns, rashes, poison ivy, scrapes, and insect bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resinol is a pinkish color, and so, can temporarily stain clothing (which comes out the next time you do laundry.) And, it does have a slight oder that is similar to calamine lotion.  However, these are very minor points, and they pale next to the extraordinary effectiveness of Resinol as a treatment for diaper rash and other skin irritation.  If I could give Resinol 10 stars, I would!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t advertized as such, but this is an amazing diaper cream. We have tried a lot of other products and many of them sting, work slowly, or don&#x27;t seem to help at all.  We&#x27;ve had our poor toddler&#x27;s backside completely red and even bleeding in a few places from diaper rash and had this Resinol stuff clear it up almost completely literally overnight.  Unbelievable.  I&#x27;m sure it works for other things too, but we&#x27;ll be keeping it on hand as long as we have kids in diapers &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> with all the drugs for treatment of psorisis this old time ointment does the job.also for other skin disorders too</li>
    <li> Best product for diaper rash hands down.  My baby had diaper rash so bad it was bleeding, destin and other products I felt were making it worse.  I used Resinol and it was GONE in 2 days.  Just glad I found this product for my first baby so I know what to use for future ones!</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff, although not for children under two, cured a grandchild&#x27;s diaper rash almost overnight</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 40 years. My mother used it for years and got me to using it. I work outside and i walk about 20 25 miles a day. I get gaulded very bad, but you put resinol on and the pain is gone real fast. I will keep this product on hand always.  thanks</li>

    <li> Desitin is great, but we really have to cake it on to provide the wetness barrier, and it smells bad.  Resinol was actually recommended by our pediatrician, and we liked it better immediately.  It really helps keep my daughter&#x27;s rashes at bay.  My wife is a Dermatologist, and she likes it better too.  I just wish it were available at Babies R us in those super-sized tubs like Desitin is.</li>
    <li> Works perfect every time. Would buy again. Over and over again. Many more times. Keep buying. All the time. Yes.</li>
    <li> I started using this product thirty years ago with my own children.  Now I&#x27;m using on my grandchildren.  Very effective against diaper rash and other skin irritations.</li>
    <li> Very good product .... old fashioned....learned about it from my Grandma.  Best ever product for chapped or chaffed skin. Good for diaper rash, and any adult chapped/chaffed skin also.  Keeps skin covered.</li>
    <li> Resinol has been in my medicine chest since I was a child back in the 50&#x27;s.  We use it for everything from minor burns and diaper rash to poison ivy and chicken pox.  Any type of skin irritation seems to be soothed by Resinol and I find it even helps prevent infection.  I highly recommend Resinol to anyone looking for skin relief especially of you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Mom always used this for baby rash and other things and when my nieces baby had a bad diaper rash, blisters and was raw.  I think she was allergic to the diapers but it would not clear up, she used everything on it.  Now days you can&#x27;t find it on the shelves but my sister went to an older drug store and they did have it.  Her little butt was cleared up the next day.  I never thought of ordering it on line,  it&#x27;s cheaper, last time I had the pharmacy order it they charged me like 12.00 give or take.  I&#x27;m going to order some more of it..</li>
    <li> Just the same as when my mom would put it on me as a kid.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product to ease pain and soreness, so I ordered it, tried it, and think it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic, thanks to this pruduct my 10 months old boy Don&#x27;t know what baby diaper rash means.</li>
    <li> Works great on cuticles that are sore/red.  Works fast, in 10-15 minutes pain is diminished or gone.  My clients love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff cures any skin problem</li>
    <li> this is really good for rashes</li>
    <li> I remember this product from many years ago. My mother recommended it for just about any skin problem. It was like a heavy paste. Today it is much thinner like a cream and didn&#x27;t do much for my wife&#x27;s skin rash. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it anymore.</li>
    <li> Best ointment out there!!  From burns to diaper rash to chaffing it heals all!!  Love the stuff!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OINTMENT.  I HAVE USED THIS FOR MANY MANY YEARS.  IT IS WONDERFUL FOR DIAPER RASH TOO.  THIS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR AT LEAST 20 YEARS THAT I KNOW OF BECAUSE I USE TO USE IT FOR DIAPER RASH CREAM.  MY CHILDREN ARE GROWN NOW.</li>
    <li> An old ointment from back in the day this stuff is great for healing everything from pimples to poison ivy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because a co-worker said she used it years ago while growing up and thought it was no longer available, upon searching on the internet for it I found it is available at Amazon so I ordered it but I really haven&#x27;t had much opportunity to try it out, fortunately no scrapes, sores, or burns. However, what I have heard elsewhere is zinc is good for healing and that is why I want to try it. Silver is supposed to be another time proven remedy for healing wounds and I want to have that in my arsenal for healing.</li>
    <li> My family has always had a jar of Resinol around.  It works for scrapes, any irritation, chapped skin etc.  It used to smell odd, and I think the smelly stuff worked better, but this still works wonders.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a small rash that I had on my hands. Will definitely keep this in stock.</li>
    <li> This is a old time remedy product that my grandparents used. The product was received on a timely bases. The description of the product was exactly as the advertisement shown on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> This is the best ointment for minor skin problem - rashes, mosquito bites, sunburn, etc.---</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 55 yrs old and a third generation user of Resinol. I used it on my kids when they were little, now use it on my grandkids. My kids called it &amp;#34;grandma medicine&amp;#34; after I told them my grandma always used it.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the original scent, it reminded me of my grandma. I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as they make it. Very hard to find in stores but thankfully it can be found on the internet.</li>
    <li> The jar of Resinol I had was just enough to take care of my nephew&#x27;s skinned knee for a few days so I ordered a new jar. Resinol has always had a place in the medicine cabinet since I was a youngster. I&#x27;ve used Resinol on other minor skin problems and abrasions with wonderful results. Our young nephews love because it doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
    <li> I learned about this from my wife, whose family has used it for years!  It heals most skin disorders.  I find that it&#x27;s best to apply at night before going to bed.</li>
    <li> I have been using Resinol since the birth of my oldest child. That was more than 16 years ago. When he had a persistant diaper rash, a friend suggested that we order this from our local pharmacy and use it right away. So we did and within hours his diaper rash was almost completly gone!</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff since my kids were babies and now can&#x27;t find it in the store. This is the best thing ever for any kind of rash and would highly recommend it to anyone from babies to adults.</li>
    <li> great for diaper rashes</li>
    <li> Honestly, it is the only good thing my mother-in-law has ever recommended. EVERY mother should use this on their infant/toddler! Completely and quickly heals diaper rash!!!</li>
    <li> Best product ever for bad diaper rash on sensitive skin. Clears the redness up in no time! Usually put a layer on, then layer of Desitin Maximum Strength. Works EVERY TIME!</li>
    <li> The best secret in the world for pimples, cuts, poison ivy and diaper rash!!!</li>
    <li> I love this ointment. I was recommended this by my sons doctor when we could not get rid of diaper rash, even with prescribed ointment! I use this for any rash or burn or bite! I will never buy anything else! This is a must!!!! I have repurchased this many times! A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is the best diaper rash cream. It doesn&#x27;t burn and the rash is noticeably better after one use. i highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best diaper rash cream.  After trying this I won&#x27;t ever by anything else.</li>
    <li> My family has been using Resinol for years, on 22 years worth of babies, and there is just nothing comparable. This stuff does the trick and heals diaper rash, as well as irritations to other parts of skin, in no time. It&#x27;s kind of messy and thick, and it will stain clothes, but that can be looked over for the amazing things this stuff does.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic - it will get rid of diaper rash overnight - it feels great on any skin issue - we call it magic medicine at our house - we keep it in the fridge to maintain freshness and it makes it feel even better when going on.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use and approve of this product.</li>
    <li> We have used this product for 2 generations now and have a hard time finding it. This was so easy and saved us over 50% off ordering (no stores carried it in stock) from all local retail stores - I did my price shopping with every one of them. Will buy more and baby has never had any diaper rash issue. GREAT PRODUCT for all of family to use.</li>
    <li> My mother always had this in our medicine cabinet, and I suspect her mother did, too.  I&#x27;ve always kept it in mine, since I left home.  I don&#x27;t use it that often - I&#x27;ve had one jar for at least a decade now, probably closer to two.  It also takes very little to do the job.  It seems like it never expires or loses its healing benefits.  And when I do need it for chafing around the crotch or other minor skin irritations, it works like a charm and clears things right up.  It also gives instant relief from any associated minor pain and itching.  I gather that it&#x27;s basically a mixture of petroleum jelly, calamine lotion, and lanolin.  But whatever is in there, it works.  There are good reasons this stuff&#x27;s been around for a century or so.  I have no reservations about recommending it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything to work on my Los bottom dr wouldn&#x27;t give rx and a friend let me try this and omg it was awesome cleared Los bottom up in just a couple diaper changes!! Also good for other skin irritations on anyone!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best ointment I have ever used. I used it on all my babies for diaper rash, as well as so many other uses, scratches, cuts, etc. This is a must have for anything. You will love it also. It soothes and help things feel better within minutes. I love it and now my children are using it on their children. I am a nurse and I have just never seen anything that works quite like this.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for my 20 month old&#x27;s diaper rash(es) that you can buy in the store. Yes, they helped but Resinol helped it MUCH faster. Thank you thank you thank you. Fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> My baby had a nasty baby rash.  Tried the regular over the counter brands, almost all of them.  Nothing seem to work right away.  Ordering online from amazon based on the reviews...Tried it one night and the following morning, my baby&#x27;s rash all but went away.  Tried it again another time and same fast results.  Couldn&#x27;t believe the product worked so well.  It only sucks that you can&#x27;t find it locally in the stores.  If you are planning to have kids, definitely have this handy; because, a rash needs to be treated right away, so don&#x27;t skimp on some necessities.</li>
    <li> I use this on my baby daughter, resinol cures diaper rash very quickly but in my opinion the best part about it is it soothes the pain almost instantly. When my daughter gets a diaper rash she screams bloody murder when we are trying to wipe it then cries afterwards. Literally as soon as we apply resinol she stops crying.</li>
    <li> After my little one had a terrible diaper rash, I purchased based on reviews. I ended up taking him to the doctor because I couldn&#x27;t wait on this to arrive. I did use it once his prescription was gone and he still had a rash. Honestly, his skin seems much more happier with this ointment. He doesn&#x27;t scratch and lies peacefully whenever I apply this ointment. I will definitely buy more once we get low. So glad i found this for him!</li>
    <li> Have used Resinol for a very long time.  A friend&#x27;s father used to use this on the cows utters because when they were full of milk they would scrape the ground...a very healing ointment that has multiple uses.  Used to be able to buy in town but the drug store no longer exists...now I order on line....</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past when my son was a baby.  Clears up diaper&lt;br /&gt;rash overnight.  The smell has changed and that is a good thing.  Great for baby&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;little bottoms.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, thick cream that was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s pediatrician. I would have some on hand. However, I have found a mixture of athlete&#x27;s foot cream and baby petroleum jelly is the particular diaper rash magic that works best for us.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as expected. Can&#x27;t go wrong with resinol. One of the few ointments that works on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product is the best it will help cure almost anything skin related. I rated it 5 stars because it works.</li>
    <li> great salve-fast fix for diaper rash-but it does  stain fabric-old fashioned product that really works. Have used it over 50 yrs</li>
    <li> I already did the rating on the tiny bottles of Resinol. So all I will say is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best go to balm, salve, cream, ointment whatever you want to call it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a believer. Got a nasty bug bite in the park. Area was ON FIRE. Used this ointment for a few days and now the area is close to normal; no more itching or stinging.</li>
    <li> The best cream for baby diaper rush</li>
    <li> My mother used this on me when I was a baby, and now I use it on my daughter, who is now 15 months. Resinol is the absolute best thing for diaper rash ever. If the baby is red, use resinol, and in a few hours she will be as good as new. I have tried 7 other creams and ointments (including AD, California Babies, Earth&#x27;s Best, Desitin, Burt&#x27;s Bees etc) because I wanted something in a tube for the diaper bag, but I keep coming back to Resinol. Nothing else even comes close. I wish I could give it 6 stars.</li>
    <li> Great ointment. Soothing and long lasting</li>
    <li> I like this product, heals issues fast. Family has been using this product for I believe 40 or so years.</li>
    <li> Family remedy for decades.  Wonderful product.  Takes the sting out of cuts and sores.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  My youngest son is only a couple of months old and he had a diaper rash that would not go away.  We tried every cream we could find and nothing seamed to work.  Finally our pediatrician told us about Resinol.  Worked like a champ and cleared the diaper rash right up.</li>
    <li> Love resinol. Best for anything from zits to rashes!</li>
    <li> We have used this since our oldest ,21 now , was a baby and now use it with the second round ,our foster babies !!!  This is the best and we tell all new Moms about it !!</li>
    <li> Our family has been using this product for generations! Nothing else compares. Great for diaper rash, chaff, cuts, burns and so much more. My son refers to it as &amp;#34;miracle cream&amp;#34;.</li>
