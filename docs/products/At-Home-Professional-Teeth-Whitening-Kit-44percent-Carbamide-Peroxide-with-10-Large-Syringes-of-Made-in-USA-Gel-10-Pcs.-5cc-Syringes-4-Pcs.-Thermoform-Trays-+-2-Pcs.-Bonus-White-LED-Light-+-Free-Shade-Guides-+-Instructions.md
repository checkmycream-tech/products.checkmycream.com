<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product worked great! I get comments all the time on how white my teeth are. Even minimizes minor flourosis stains. Yes it&#x27;s burns if you get some on your gums but it&#x27;s tolerable. Never used the led lights...I doubt they do anything. I&#x27;m definitely happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I find this to be a good quality teeth whitening kit, with everything needed. The gel is pro strength and you receive 10 extra large syringes. I also received trays and white led lights. You just use a tiny bit of gel on the trays and place trays onto your teeth. It just takes 10-15 minutes. I wear the trays while in the shower. You should never put too much gel in the tray or that extra gel will spill over on your&lt;br /&gt;gums. You will hurt your gums if you do that! The gel is strong and it works making my teeth white. I am going to buy more when I ran out.</li>
    <li> This kit really works and is quite inexpensive.  Occasionally the nozzle on one of the peroxide syringes will get clogged with hardened gel but a toothpick is all you need to clear it.  I haven&#x27;t decided if the toy light does much - this is my second kit and the first one didn&#x27;t include the lights.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant difference with the light but the price was about the same so no worries either way.</li>
    <li> Made my teeth whiter first time using it.  Did burn my gums a tad. I found it helpful to use a qtip and place gel on teeth then put trays over them.  Less gel n not on gums😊</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after one application, I&#x27;ve done about 4 sessions of whitening and my smile is definitely whiter and brighter. My husband keeps commenting on how white they look. I tend do drink lots of coffee and diet coke and tea so my teeth had stains to begin with. It can make your gums feel tingly during application so avoid getting this on your gums. I usually put the stuff directly on my teeth, smear it around with a q tip and then put the mouth piece over to limit exposure to my lips and gums. It did turn part of my gum white once, but that disappeared probably 15 minutes later.</li>
    <li> My daughter just got her braces off and her teeth have become excessively yellow in the areas where the metal once laid. Her dentist wanted over $500 for a whitening treatment but this was too expensive. We opted to buy this whitening system since it uses the same general system and gel strength. The trays were easy to form and the gel did not cause any sensitivity issues. The first use saw a lot of the yellow dissipate. After a month, she had gorgeous white teeth! A must have.</li>
    <li> as described.  very potent, hurts the first time.  but the second was much better.  third I hardly knew i had it in my mouth.  product seems to work well,</li>
    <li> I hate this product it does not work. I want my money back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great price and quality works amazing !!</li>
    <li> If I could give 0 stars I would. It was missing product when it arrived and I had 3mm not the 5 described. Missing 2 syringes an 3 mouth guards. The product it&#x27;s self actually was unusable it actually damaged my gum where a small amount seeped on.</li>
    <li> Great price, works great, had for about 6 months now</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product since it was so inexpensive. I would never have imagined that it would be so easy to use &amp; effective. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. If you&#x27;re on the fence, go for it. Your smile will thank you!</li>
    <li> Good value for the money. The trays are cumbersome as I prefer the softer one piece tray. Easy to use with good results</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference and it burns</li>
    <li> Waste of money frauds</li>
    <li> As a child growing up I often refused to brush my teeth and now as an adult I have come to regret such decisions, burdened with the look of yellow, unattractive teeth I set out to do something about it. I stumbled upon this problem, it promised results that I could only imagine in my wildest dreams, but after trying this product, my dreams came true and my teeth have never been whiter than they are now, I don&#x27;t know how to praise this product enough due to how much it has changed my life, I am forever in debt to this product and would recommend it to everyone without a glimmer of doubt!</li>
    <li> Love it but the light is a must to get max results. Can burn the gums so be careful and I normally used every other day to give my gums time to recover</li>
    <li> Works great but hurts</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find that it did work.  With about a 5 day run of using the product my teeth were noticeably whiter.  The price was fair and it did work so I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the system I use.&lt;br /&gt;1. Brush and floss teeth&lt;br /&gt;2. Dry teeth with tissue and then suck in air between clenched teeth to remove as much saliva as possible.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply peroxide gel to que-tip and carefully coat surface of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;4. Insert rubber teeth guards.&lt;br /&gt;5. Place blue light devise against teeth and hold in place with lips&lt;br /&gt;6. Continue for 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;7. Remove teeth guards from mouth, rinse teeth with fresh water and brush teeth again.&lt;br /&gt;8. I do this once every morning for 7 days of the first week of each month. Then I give my gums a rest for the remaining 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a vast improvement in teeth whiteness since using this product for 2 weeks in a 2 month period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teeth whitening tips:&lt;br /&gt;When drinking coffee, tea, red wine or dark colored fruit juices, have a glass of water on hand, and from time to time take a sip or two of water after each drink. This will help mitigate the stains.</li>
    <li> I recently quit smoking and had some horrendous teeth to show for it. I decided to buy this whitening treatment and it has slowly but surely turned my ugly yellow teeth into a much more respectable white. I will be buying more just to maintain this smile when my current batch runs out!</li>
    <li> This kit came with 10 large syringes of pro strength 44% Carbamide Peroxide gel. Four whitening teeth trays and two lights to use during treatment. It seems like a couples pack. The instructions tell you to go slow and steady when using this product - because it is very strong. I can tell you that you need a very little gel per tooth. If you get the gel onto your gums, wipe it off. You may want to use one tray at a time. After just 2 sessions I  noticed a change in my teeth whiteness. You really get a lot for the your money. I didn’t have any sensitivity . I did receive this kit for free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> havent seen any progress they burn and hurt but u get used to it</li>
    <li> Burns some if left on gum tissue. Great price for what you get. Works a little bit better than OTC products. guess it would be worth recommending.</li>
    <li> I liked this whitening system. I used my own trays from my dentist instead of the ones provided. I used a q-tip to apply the gel to my teeth. The taste isn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the light a few times, before I was too lazy for it. The kit comes with detailed instructions. This is a very convenient product, that I can recommend others.  *I received this product in exchange for an honest review. Opinion is all mine.</li>
    <li> Dont get it on your gums!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  This is my second order.  My first order did not include the light which is a great addition.  Just dip the plastic molds in the boiling water for seconds at a time until it fits your mouth.  Trim away any excess plastic if it pokes into your gums.  Protect your gums with vasline if you are really sensitive but, of course, do not get vaseline on your teeth.  The product needs to go there.  Try and use the product for 3 straight days then you can go 2 or 3 days.  It whitened my teeth so much, I was and an very impressed. Product comes quickly and well packaged.  Keep the clear vials in the fridge.  I remove the batteries from the light after every use.  Just keep it in the included little baggie.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good thing this set comes with two sets of mouth trays, because it is very easy to mess up the fitting procedure where you have to [place the trays in near boiling water for a few seconds then place them on your teeth. Screwing up and getting the wrong fit is really easy to do. But once you get a good fit, if you do it very carefully, it works nicely. Just try not to get the whitening sgent on your gums as it can burn.</li>
    <li> A got some gorgeous pearly whites now. Just don&#x27;t get the gel on your gums... it stings and burns like no other</li>
    <li> No comment on the efficacy of the product yet, just a comment about its origins. I purchased it, as I have decided to stay away from Chinese-made products, particularly if they go on the skin or in the mouth. You just don&#x27;t know what is in them, and they have no regard for human safety. I recognize these products that came re-packaged in a box with no information, as the same being sold from China.</li>
    <li> The higher % products will work with regular use.  I will use every day for about three weeks and then every 2-3 days, thereafter.  I keep the tray in for 25 minutes, give or take.  I have used this product with and without the light and I believe that the light helps.  Buy the remineralization gel separately, for better long-term care of your teeth. For what these products do, they are a significant bargain.</li>
    <li> This came in a timely manner, nicely packaged, too. The product itself is not as good as the other whitening system I have bought from Amazon. Having said that, it does work fairly well, takes much longer to work compared to the last product I bought. That&#x27;s why I gave 3 stars.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work as advertised</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice for my top teeth. Molding the teeth with the mouth gaurds took almost an hour for my boyfriend and I to do..I messed up one of them so I&#x27;m left with just the top. I suggest using a pen to outline your teeth and the using clean nail clippers to clip off the excess</li>
    <li> Pearly whites over here</li>
    <li> My dentist always said not to use whitening products like strips, toothpaste, or gels because he should be the one whitening my teeth. The issue is the guy wanted over $300 per session! His scare tactics didn’t work and I decided to buy this system. It works, doesn’t hurt my teeth, and I have saved hundreds of dollars on a smile that is just as good; if not better than the dental office one.</li>
    <li> Depends on whether you&#x27;re very sensitive to the cleaner, but if you&#x27;re like me, this does a better&lt;br /&gt;job than professional applications, does it in 5-10 minutes -- i. e., no overnight trays -- and does&lt;br /&gt;it for about 1/15th the cost.</li>
    <li> I would give it a zero if I could! Both lights are broken and do not work. Unfortunately I can not return item. DONT BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> it definitely whitens but it really burned the roof of my mouth so try not to use too much gel</li>
    <li> Good kit, 44% carbamide, good price. I recomend it too all that want to white their teeth. Pratical blue ligth included.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great value. Had a little trouble fitting the trays, but they work at the end. I did a 20 min treatment the first time due to sensitivity in the gums, but I&#x27;m going to do a follow up soon.</li>
    <li> love it my teeth are deff whiter and i get lots of compliments my boyf is dying for me to get him this you see my teeth glowing of how white they are</li>
    <li> Product is unbranded. Packaging is bad, everything has been crammed into a single box and the box looks like it has been jumped on a few times. 3 gels lost caps in transit and leaked on the way. Shade Guide is a low quality printed paper and worthless. I have not tested the kits. Product does work. 2 stars, because I received a deformed LED light and couldn&#x27;t contact the seller for a replacement.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have been using every other day for the last two weeks and my teeth are sparkling white. I have not experienced any teeth sensitivity at all and I have not been using with the silly LED light that comes with the product. I have also used along with a Remineralization Gel.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews about this product before I bought it, I set my mind to follow all instructions and I used it twice a day, and within two weeks I can tell it really works, is a little bit uncomfortable but if you want white theeth you will do it, recommended</li>
    <li> This product will definitely whiten your teeth. However, I strongly suggest that you use it very sparingly when you fill the trays as it&#x27;s extremely powerful (way more powerful than Crest Whitestrips). I say this because the gel came over the top of my tray and severely burned my gums within minutes. My skin was raw and scarred for a long time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is super strong na dburns the hell out of your gums with in seconds of using it. OUCH</li>
    <li> Whitens my teeth just makes them sensitive after. Does its job</li>
    <li> Easy to use and whitened my coffee stained teeth in about a week&lt;br /&gt;of 10 minute daily use.  Recommend the product .</li>
    <li> Does not provide a quality fit.  Burns my gums</li>
    <li> After just one or two seconds of inserting the trays with the whitening gel, the gel that squeezed out onto my gums started to burn.  A lot. I immediately spit out the trays and began rinsing my mouth with cold water.  I then grabbed a soft toothbrush to try to brush away the gel that was still burning.  My gums had turned an alarming white color in just seconds of contact.  It is now 4 days later and my gums are still red and raw...so painful that I can&#x27;t touch them with my toothbrush.  I am still waiting to see what the long-term outcome of the burns are going to be.  I am hoping for the best but I still feel worried and upset.</li>
    <li> i blind fools with my smile now...what</li>
    <li> Did not whiten my teeth or my daughters teeth at all. All it did was make my teeth sensitive for two days afterward. We both used this over the course of two weeks and obtained no results.&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It came on time &amp; with everything that was said to be included. I&#x27;ve used it 4 times since I&#x27;ve gotten it &amp; I can already see a difference. My teeth weren&#x27;t stained bad or yellow. I just wanted to whiten up my smile more without paying that high dental office cost. Now this product is VERY STRONG it will burn your gums of the whitening solution touches your gums. What I do is put some vasoline on my gums before I do it. Also in this case less is more. Don&#x27;t over fill the teeth guards because it&#x27;ll spill over &amp; burn your gums really bad. I made that mistake my 1st time doing it.</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars for effectiveness but it burns my gums and made my teeth a little sensitive.  I just don&#x27;t have very sensitive teeth or gums so this is POWERFUL stuff, be careful.  The flip side is the price is so outstanding for what you get and it works.  One treatment made my teeth whiter than the natural white on the strip provide but I&#x27;ve bleached in the past.  I use it as maintenance because you can&#x27;t leave it in very long.  My real suggestion would be to forget the trays and buy some cheap white strips that are not the wax type, thin strips that fit snug and add this to the strips before applying.  This stopped the seepage onto the gums that the trays caused and it also makes the product last longer so it&#x27;s worth the extra cost for some disposable strips.  Also if you don&#x27;t wash the trays really good old gel remains and that spot will show up as less white.  Also the light works better through strips, again not those wax mold bargain/no name or store name generic kind just the thin strips that you toss.  Anyway this method fixed the painful and white bleached gums I got from using the trays provide so I am over as happy as five stars but that fifth star required the purchase of another product which I found cheaper at my local store than here.</li>
    <li> The mouth trays are terribly uncomfortable, it allows the peroxide to get  under the roof of your mouth and it burns. I think by trying to use this, I conjured up my TMJ again</li>
    <li> This product really does work well. Its strong enough to get the job done.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have just starting using these. Be sure to trim the mouth pieces down as much as you need.  I didn&#x27;t do that and burned my gum pretty good the first time.  On the plus side, because I have such small teeth, the whitener will last a long time.  It has enough of everything for two people so makes a great husband and wife activity.</li>
    <li> Yes it does it job by cleaning/bleaching your teeth but it will burn your gums so please be careful ok!</li>
    <li> i have never tried any teeth whitening gels or anything and this one feels like there&#x27;s dirt/tiny rocks mixed in with the gel and it irritates my gums, don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
    <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t so yellow, but I wanted to make them really white, superstar white... which I definitely don&#x27;t have.  I&#x27;ve used this product twice, and it appeared whiter, but not noticeably whiter.  No one has made any comments yet.  I used it on a Monday night and followed the (typed by the seller I&#x27;m guessing) instructions that came in the envelope (btw, don&#x27;t expect a box, atleast, I just got my product emptied into an envelope and I&#x27;m not sure if this was mentioned by the seller) but totally botched both sets of teeth gaurds. They really are horrible and if you put them in boiling water, I suggest dipping one at a time in quickly a couple of times, but NOT 5-15 seconds as the instructions suggest.  I formed them in my mouth as the instructions suggested, and the gaurds looked like crap after with on just totally deformed. So I said f it and just put the peroxide on the gaurds and placed it in. After 5-10 minutes I felt tingling sessions and after 20 minutes it began to burn a bit.  This was all expectected.  Might I add that I have pretty decent gums and a tolerance for this kind of of pain.  The enemal did feel weaker, and you probably don&#x27;t want to eat hot foods after.  Left it in 35 minutes while flashing the light on it the entire time.  After, I removed the gaurds and washed out my mouth.  My teeth appeared slightly whiter, but not superstar white which was a debbie downer.  So I repeated the same thing the next night, and could only handle 20 minutes as it hurt like hell and it felt like putting salt on open wounds.  It took 3-4 days for my gums to heal.  I will probably try it again after a week.  I do suggest using saran wrap as one of the other reviewers had said.  Let&#x27;s hope that 10 of these, once a week, gets me the results I want!  I won&#x27;t find out till October unfortunately as it&#x27;s only the middle of August now.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, does not work. Worst whitning product I have ever used. Ended up throwing it out.</li>
    <li> First  time I have ever used a teeth whitening product where I saw a difference on the first application! It only took .5 cc&#x27;s for the application so with 10 5cc syringes that&#x27;s a hundred treatments! What a great price for exactly what they can do at the dentist or salon. Truly a great buy. Note: Some reviewers said the light did not work. You have to open the casing, remove the batteries and peel off the white sticker that tells you how to insert the batteries. Voila!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Will burn gums easily.  Best to rub something on your gums before bleaching teeth.  Start with 20 minutes and build up from there. I use Remineralization Gel after bleaching.  I use sensitive toothpaste a week before bleaching and a week after.</li>
    <li> I purchased these and they seem to work great. I stopped using them when I got tired of my teeth hurting. However they are simple to set up. Check out youtube for helpful videos for creating your trays. I think I will probably continue to use them down the line.</li>
    <li> This product is very bad it causes your mouth to burn and get sores i don&#x27;t recommend it for anybody</li>
    <li> Sunny smiles are important, but please, please, please do your research before you apply any product. Especially ones you see on the internet.Things you have to consume or place on your body either look with a doctor or dentist first! Or see if you can find it at your local store or pharmacy.  Anything you can&#x27;t find there? Usually hasn&#x27;t passed the FDA&#x27;s screening process and thus contains risks. In this case; you may end up with sores, lesions and even acute bleeding from the gums. Does this sound like something you really want to risk?</li>
    <li> I was right about to buy this product but then through doing research I found out that they are seriously a shady company! It turns out they&#x27;re selling a lot of counterfeit products, you really can&#x27;t trust them and they might permanently damage your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at the homepage of this product: shinewhitening.com Apparently Cool Teeth Whitening is copying their brand and selling fake products!!! Fair warning, buyer beware!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m surprised they would do such a brazen and illegal act! Its likely they will be sued, but we as consumers should really be careful against companies like Cool Teeth Whitening. I recommend you do NOT buy their products!</li>
    <li> Have started noticing results after only a couple uses. Easy to form the mouth pieces to your teeth. Easy to use. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> Have used only a few days and still not seen a big difference. Will know more in another week or so.</li>
    <li> I think this is an easy to use kit for at home teeth whitening. No need to go to the dentist and pay those fees. This kit comes with everything you need in a nice package. My teeth were not that bad looking, but after seeing the change from just 1 treatment - I was shocked. It took me about 10 minutes to form the trays, and 10 minutes to do whitening. I am very happy with the results so far. I was offered a complimentary sample to test and express my own opinion.</li>
    <li> Gel is strong, trays are not too easy to get used to. But this kit works. You will get your teeth white. And you will hurt your gums for about 10 hours if you are not careful. Simple as that.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical on doing my own whitening process on my teeth, however I talked to my dentist and the costs were outrageous for her to do it...the receptionist told me to get over the counter product.  After a bit of research I found THIS product.  Reason I needed this product is simple.  I am having 2 partials done and wanted to whiten my teeth to their best b4 they were made.  I see some issues people have with the trays.  I didn&#x27;t have any problem when I read the directions and took 1 step at a time.  They are very comfortable and have a great fit.  As most people, they want instant results (im one of those people! lol)... but this is a longer process than most would hope for but worth it.  The first day I left the solution on for 25 min... DUMB IDEA!  My TEETH were very sore.  Not so much my gums.  The next day the pain was gone, so I again got a bit brave and did it for 20 min.  DUMB IDEA again! :)  I let my teeth and gums rest for a few days before I decided to take a more cautious approach :).  Glad I did.  In the mean time I got the remineralization syringes in the mail and I had a long talk with myself.  I for the next two days used the product for 6 min for 2 days.  AND used the remineralization after to sooth my gums and tooth sensitivity.  Its working! :)  So when you get this product, really take heed on WORKING UP to possibly 30 min a day.  Don&#x27;t do like I did...its just not worth the pain.  Good luck everyone!  I will keep using this product and hopefully have a much brighter smile in a few months to come.</li>
    <li> You can go to the trade shows and get your teeth whitened there.  This is the same concentration they use.  It&#x27;s strong.  Just keep it off your gums!  Works great!</li>
    <li> The blue lights did not work when I received product. The gel caused my gums to burn and turn white (like when you put peroxide on a cut). My first trial went fine and the trays molded well but when i repeated the steps the next time it was very painful. My gums eventually returned to normal color after about half hour but they were still sensitive for remainder of day.  I can not say if the product whitens or not because I didn&#x27;t get that far into the treatment. I am in the process of returning this product.</li>
    <li> The directions state that you need to apply a solution after your whitening treatment, but the package doesn&#x27;t include it.  I purchased 6 sets for my family and I.  I&#x27;m not very Happy!!!</li>
    <li> Weedeaterman is,  I am extremely happy, the Kit is above reproach and very effective.  Any negative comments I read are by people that can not read and follow directions,  I am buying this item again here shortly.  Great Great stuff.  The Dentist wanted 250.00 plus.  Shipping and being informed is above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great deal for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Henry, The Weedeaterman,LLC.</li>
    <li> Great value - just have to remember &#x3D; if I don&#x27;t use it, it won&#x27;t work?</li>
    <li> I tried three times. It did brighten a bit, however each time had reversible sensitivity in a few hours after the whitening process. I had to take pain killer next day. It can&#x27;t be helped. I just threw the product away.</li>
    <li> I used to have custom fitted trays from my dentist so I think I was a bit biased when trying these, however at more less than a 1/4 the cost I figured why not. I opened the box, perused the directions and went to heat up the first tray to mold to my mouth.  However, after boiling my water, dunking the first tray and popping it in my mouth, I thought I had done something wrong. I got more of a conforming look on the trays from gravity, pulling the heated tray out of the water than actually popping it in my mouth.  The tray was large needless to say and I&#x27;m a guy with a pretty big mouth. I tried it a second time, this time sucking in and biting down so I could at least tell where my teeth were hitting.  Before even using it the first time I wasn&#x27;t very excited at the thought of having these in my mouth for a prolonged time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at the directions another time I decided to try and use them.  I put the peroxide on the trays, popped the trays in my mouth and tried to insert the led light. However, no where in the directions did it say you had to cut the tabs on the front of the trays in order to use the led light. So I had two trays in my mouth with tabs protruding and no where to insert the led light. After the first time, I cut the tabs and have since had no real issues with this whitening kit. The peroxide works well and I noticed great results after just a few uses.  I&#x27;d like to give this product more stars but I realize this is a one size fits all type item so I gave it a 3 instead of a 4. I&#x27;d change it to 4 if someone can point out where it states you need to cut the tabs after you mold them to use the led light in combination.  As a final, I&#x27;d definitely say I would order these again now that Ive figured them out. However, with as long as each syringe lasts, it might be a while.</li>
    <li> tastes bad but what can you expect, does the job. Teeth are looking great and its easy to use. great value as well.</li>
    <li> I have tried different types of whitening strips with no results, but this product definitely works. I noticed results after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive teeth, so after the first use I was in pain. On my second use I brushed my teeth with Sensodyne before and after applying the gel, and felt no pain or sensitivity.</li>
    <li> these are a really good deal. I really can see a difference when I use these- It does take awhile to see a HUGE difference- but it is much longer lasting and reaches more of your mouth than strips do.</li>
    <li> love it i saw results in the fist use tastes horrible but deff worth it in the long run worth your money 100%</li>
    <li> Burned my gums. Stopped using them. Still have product; may try again. Contain carbamid peroxide, an oxidizing&lt;br /&gt;agent, very strong. Comes with trays for teeth.</li>
    <li> My teeth have gotton so white. I love this product. Since I bought 10 syringes I gave 1 syringe each to my 3 daughters. They are in their 20&#x27;s and each one of them loved it.</li>
    <li> Some people may have difficulty using this product The first time i used it i had no idea what the hell i was doing lol. I followed the regular directions and had a lot of irritation with my teeth and gums and was very uncomfortable. I then did some research to help. I learned that The tooth whitening paste actually eats the protein layer on your teeth to get rid of all surface stains, and it makes your teeth very sensitive. I recommend brushing your teeth before the treatment, NOT after because thats when your teeth are at theyre weakest. Rince them with water or mouthwash and give your teeth time to recover. I started doing it every other day until i got the hang of it, now i do it daily and for about 15 minutes. My teeth have gotten noticeably whiter, even after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product for the price, i would defiantly recommend this.</li>
    <li> The directions were really clear. So everyone who says it burned their gums must not have followed the directions as closely. I hated molding the trays to my mouth but honestly this is one of the best kits I have ever used. I would recommend it. It really works!</li>
    <li> Shipping was sooo fast! After using it once I saw a big difference in the color of my teeth. Really is a great product for a great price. Vary happy with my purchase : ) !!</li>
    <li> A BARGAIN PRICE AND GREAT QUALITY.</li>
    <li> This did not work as well as the advertise it to.  My daughter did not have any luck whitening her teeth just made them sore and tender to the touch..</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product, I applied it one time and actually saw a noticiable difference and so did my co-worker. If you have staining from coffee, tea or whatever, I urge you to purchase this item, it&#x27;s definitely worth EVERY dollar.</li>
    <li> I have looked at several different teeth whitening kits and this one really stands out.  It comes in professional packaging (unlike some other I have seen on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is enough gel for at least a year and you also get trays, lights, color guides and instructions. The gel is dentist grade strong so I use is just for 15 minutes at a time and I&#x27;d say that is more than enough for me. No need to over use it. I have seen others saying they had their teeth perfectly white only after just 1 use but it was after the second use that I said “wow”. You will see results after the first use but it was not “wow” worthy for me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read the instructions, it basically goes like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You mold your trays with some hot water, they have a lot of details on this step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a tiny little bead of gel to each tooth groove inside the trays. Put the trays on. Don&#x27;t get the gel onto your gums.&lt;br /&gt;Turn the light on and place it over the trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait for a few minutes, take the trays of , check for gum zingers. If there are zingers, you used too much gel. Wipe the trays and start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are comfortable go on for the full 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do this twice a week, and you won&#x27;t remember the yellow teeth days.  You basically need only 1 kit for the entire year.  Great value, unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> Im not sure that the light does anything, but the gel definitely whitens on its own.Be careful to not get on gums.. it turns them white.</li>
    <li> Like most other gels, it can hurt if left in to long. I found that 2 applications of 1/8 syringe volume for 1 week resulted in some tenderness but brought teeth from a 7/10 in whiteness to a 9/10. Very effective.</li>
    <li> Worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;They show you step by step everything toy need to do and that&#x27;s very helpful. Love it!</li>
    <li> The Consumer Protection Agency has determined this product can cause people’s mouths to burn, get sores. A number of other very illegal and potentially harmful things have been discovered pertaining to this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought maybe it would be safe.  Really, let’s be honest here.  Buying teeth whitening stuff from a unknown company on the internet is a sketchy business for sure.  It does &amp;#34;say&amp;#34; it is made in the United States (although it is called &amp;#34;global teeth whitening&amp;#34; or something like that, so I&#x27;m not sure how honest that is).  But anyway, that is all beside the point.  I gave it two tries.  Both times, I followed the directions exactly.  The first time I thought I must be doing something wrong. It burned my gums so badly I could not leave it on my teeth for more than one minute.  The second time I was really careful not to get any on my gums, to cut the mold exact...I did it all right.  However, if you use it correctly you are still going to get a little on your gums.  I did get a little on, tried to wipe it off promptly, and it still burned.  I&#x27;m not talking a little burn.  Nope.  No way.  I&#x27;m talking &amp;#34;holy cow, something is really wrong, I&#x27;m going to burn off my gums&amp;#34; kind of burn.  Again, I could only leave it on for less than a minute because it hurt that badly.  I&#x27;m no wimp, but I was really worried I was going to do permanent damage.  And it did, it actually damaged my gums.  They are burned... for real.  They are white where the substance got on them, and it&#x27;s not from the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; effect.  Nope, the gums are white  because they are burned.  In fact, in a couple spots it actually receded some because some of the gums burned away.  I&#x27;m not exaggerating.  Don&#x27;t buy this stuff.  You will be sorry.  I&#x27;m pretty sure many of the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; reviews are seeded from the company.</li>
    <li> I used this everyday for a week and lightened my teeth at least 3 shades.  It&#x27;s somewhat irritating if left in too long or too much gel is used.  Just be careful and put in the right amount.  I think the lights are just for show, but the gel works fine..  Use the remineralization gel to sooth sensitivity of teeth and gums is a must.</li>
    <li> so it does whiten but the mouth pieces are pretty large it just didn&#x27;t seem to fit but even though they didn&#x27;t mold well to my mouth it still whitened my teeth so I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any prior experience with any teeth whitening kit that being said I did use many different brand of teeth whitening strips before. Strips are good and practical but they don&#x27;t have the power of whitening. Now I can very honestly say this: after I used this cool teeth whitening kit, I kinda wish that I found this much sooner. You just can&#x27;t compare this to the strips. My teeth have never been whiter and brighter. I believe this product is comparable to what dentists use. Nothing like strips.  I do have sensitive teeth so I was very careful not to over do the whitening. 10 minutes was enough for me, may be I can do 15 minutes. So far, I have only used this for a week, total of 3 times. My first session was a 2 minute tester. Now now, after a week, I can see a very significant change in the whiteness of my teeth. I started with a shade 7 and now I am 4. I was offered this kit free in exchange for my opinion. My review is 100% truthful and of my own. I personally liked this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know about teeth whitening products sold online until after I noticed a big difference in my friends smile.  I assumed that was a costly dentist visit but I was wrong.  She game me the link to this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The product is just as described. Very professionally packaged.  There is a lot of whitening gel and they are all marked as made in usa.&lt;br /&gt;I got my teeth whitened several shades in 2 sessions just like she said. I am very happy with this. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I can already see great results.  Very easy to use if you follow the instructions. This is much better than going to the dentist for whitening. And I get to keep my $300.  I can&#x27;t wait to show my white teeth to my dentist. I hope he asks me about I the cost, the face he will make I am going to put as my new phone background :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son because he wanted to whiten his teeth and it seems to work okay, but you really have to use a lot of the gel to get the effect you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> This is just amazing product, you will see the improvements in less than 1 day (one 30 minute session) and you will see results quick no joke. I felt better to smile in pictures once again.</li>
    <li> This product does give you great results.The difference I noticed in the past 10 days is like night and day. I recommend this if you want to improve your smile. I don&#x27;t have to use this every day and my teeth still looks great. This is best kit I have come across so far. Buy this and you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY TIPS: Take your time with the trays, and it will pay off. And I store the gel in the fridge to prolong the expiration date.</li>
    <li> It started damaging my gums, so i went to using it once a week. And it still hurt. Idk maybe my teeth were too sensitives are the product is too hard</li>
    <li> I was reading the reviews seen a couple bad ones and didn&#x27;t know what to expect but when i say this stuff really works i mean ive seen a major difference in how white my teeth are. And it never burned my gums until i tried to (crazy i know)  by putting on a lot in contact with my gums for a while presented a lil problem but i love it and will buy again soon as i run out!!!</li>
    <li> I followed all directions, bought it because someone told me about it. It burned my gums, and I stopped using it. One week later, the bottom of my front teeth feet very sensible to everything, food, drinks, anything. It&#x27;s horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Trowing it out.</li>
    <li> The product works well it whitens however it did make my teeth very sore, I couldn&#x27;t have them on for more than 10 minutes, before I got this stinging sensation in my mouth. It burnt my gums and now my tooth really bothers me, I haven&#x27;t gone to the dentist but honestly if you have a sensitive mouth don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trays did not work very well either, my mouth is not huge but its not little either, the trays shrunk, maybe I did it wrong. The first tray I had to re-do it and the second time it didn&#x27;t cover all of my teeth.</li>
    <li> first of all, i would just like to warn everyone that this is extremely strong whitening gel (44%). after about 10-20 minutes of use on your first few uses, your gums will hurt. for me a little part of my gums that border my teeth turn white but tho only lasts a few minutes. although it is nice to have the blue lights included, i don&#x27;t really use them because i doubt their effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;important things to remember:&lt;br /&gt;-be sure the mold the trays properly and follow the directions in the included booklet!&lt;br /&gt;-dry your teeth before putting the trays on with the gel&lt;br /&gt;-for your first few times, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving the gel on your teeth for more than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-dont freak out if a little bit of your gums turn white! it will go away in 15 minutes tops!&lt;br /&gt;-only use every other day until you think you can do it more often.&lt;br /&gt;-the gel can become painful for your teeth if left on for a little. stick with it! whitening in progress!&lt;br /&gt;-this causes a little tooth sensitivity after removal so beware&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy whitening!</li>
    <li> Mouth guards don&#x27;t conform to your mouth at all. Teeth don&#x27;t get whiter. You might think they do but I&#x27;m just so over it right now. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I usually use Crest Whitestrips, but switched to this package because it&#x27;s more affordable. I will use this from now on. It&#x27;s much stronger than what you can get at the pharmacy. I followed one user&#x27;s suggestion and used the gel with plastic wrap instead of the trays.</li>
    <li> This only came with 2 trays, 3 syringes and no LED light! I&#x27;m very upset because I could&#x27;ve gotten more for my money else where so do not expect to receive everything shown</li>
    <li> Strong and does the trick. I hav formed inserts (trays to hold the gel) professionally made so I didn&#x27;t use the trays that came with this but the gel was primarily what I wanted and it is full strength, fresh, and shipped fassst. Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> This product is such a waste of money. The trays do not mold to your teeth well, even after you put them in boiled water like the instructions say to. The gel burns so bad that you can&#x27;t even keep the trays in your mouth for over a minute. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I think this is one of the best kits i have ever bought and used, it is simple and easy and works very well, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> 5 shades whiter after 5 treatments, plus an additional set of trays and gels for my wife all for $20.00 try to bet that anywhere else.</li>
    <li> This kit works great! I noticed a difference after the first use! However, it burned my gums, but it did make my teeth white!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Strong product. Had troubled with the molding the bottom tray but top mold came out awesome.  Would recommend youtubing a demonstration to follow. Overall good product. Can&#x27;t best the price!</li>
    <li> SOOOO MUCH WORK.. trimming and cutting and adjusting and boiling and soaking and wtf.. this is taking way too much time. Really wish I got good old Crest Whitning strips or any other off the shelf product. Only get this if you want to feel like Bill Nye.</li>
    <li> These work much faster than the Crest White strips do.  I noticed a considerable change in my teeth color after just one treatment!  After 5 treatments, I couldn&#x27;t believe how white my teeth were.  Gel will burn the gums if you put too much gel in the mouth trays, so be careful and use less than you think.  I followed the directions and didn&#x27;t notice any teeth sensitivity (start at 2 minutes the first time, and work your way up to 15 minutes max).</li>
    <li> I will purchase this again. It is very high quality. My wife likes it also. Unlike the people who go to the dentist and  come out with idiot white teeth that require you to wear sunglasses to look at them, this allows you to do it in stages and get the shade of whiteness you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve seen Chumlee on Pawn Stars, you&#x27;ll know what I mean.</li>
    <li> The trays just don&#x27;t form very well. Maybe the material is too thick? It could have been user error, but it took two complete sets to get a set that kind of works. The gel does have a visible impact on my teeth. I always use the blue light, so I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not it makes a difference. A reasonably priced alternative to the pricier set-ups available in drug stores.</li>
    <li> Trays were useless and the LED lights did not works.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, paying for the gel.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> The product works perfectly and the shipping to Japan was about two weeks.The carbamide peroxide 44% is very strong which I  never met in Japan before. Fortunately, I don&#x27;t feel pain of the gums which some people say. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love how this contains two sets for one really low price I saw one set on groupon for 40 bucks! this one has many more treatments and is much cheaper</li>
    <li> My teeth are pretty white.  I say a shade 4 on the charts.  After one use I notice them whiter already.  Had them in for about 20 minutes with the led light.  Great product and worth the price.  I&#x27;m glad I chose this over the expensive dentist visit.  There is enough gel in here to last me the whole year but I&#x27;ll probably be done after just one tube.</li>
    <li> Trying to wait before I wrote a review because I ended up with irritated gums not due to the product but something I ate.  Because I still have the instructions from the original Whitelight  whitening kit, I noticed that the original and the newer version only share 3 key ingredients when the original whitened my teeth after a week with 10 more ingredients.  When I start the regimen again and hopefully see a difference, I will change my review.</li>
    <li> I started using the product once a week,it took a few times to start seeing results. My teeth was really stained from coffee,now i use it every other day. It works!!!</li>
    <li> Product gets teeth very white, plenty of teeth whitening gel provided. There is at least a full years supply.</li>
    <li> The light that comes with this burns out fast, the batteries are costly. So So</li>
    <li> These definitely work. You get enough of these, for a pretty cheap price, that you can pretty much experiment around with how long you want to leave them on. I have been through one tube, leaving it on an average of 15 minutes, and my teeth are definitely whiter. I am still playing around with the tray though, and I know that some other people said not to mold it, but I like it better molded. I will definitely not buy the Crest products again. I think these work faster and dont leave my teeth nearly as sensitive as the Crest products. I can do this for about 3 days in a row before my teeth will start to be sensitive, then give it a day or two rest, if I start to feel tooth sensitivity, then do another 3 days. With the crest, I could do 2 days, and then they would be sensitive for about 3 or 4 days.</li>
    <li> THIS WILL BURN YOUR GUMS AND ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH!  BE CAREFUL.&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it, guesss I put too much in. Within a minute, my eyes were tearing up. My gums burned and roof of my mouth hurts after two uses in two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a slight whiter color after the second use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a whitening kit already molded to my mouth from the dentist, so I used that.&lt;br /&gt;I think maybe the best way to do this is to dab small amounts on the tooth with a Q-TIP.&lt;br /&gt;I agree, do not use a lot!!  It will burn!&lt;br /&gt;Putting it on a toothbrush and brushing may work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However you use it, use a small amount first. I was skeptical of it burning, but it did.&lt;br /&gt;I think continued daily use for a week or two will makle a difference, just be careful.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions on fitting the trays, bumbled the first set but no worries b/c it comes with a spare. Works great and fast!</li>
    <li> The package arrived quickly, but looked different than described and pictured. I tried it anyway thinking that the packaging might have changed since the picture was taken. That&#x27;s my mistake. I only add that to warn others to be cautious. I used it 3 times, 5 minutes each in 1 week. The 3rd time, I noticed a chunk of my back molar missing. Two days later, my dentist told me that 8 teeth had enamel damage from the product. No problem before! 2 months and over $1000 later, my teeth are fixed, but they&#x27;ll never be the same</li>
    <li> Excellant product.. easy to use and perfect results</li>
    <li> OK, trays are way to big but I had trays made by my dentist so works well for me.</li>
    <li> This product is WAY, WAY, WAY too strong for over-the-counter use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dangerously strong - Burns the gums almost immediately.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well on my teeth which were not very stained and on my husband&#x27;s teeth which were very stained from years of smoking.  My teeth were visibility lighter after one application and his after 3 or 4.  We now use it for maintenance once a month.  Have recommended to several others who noticed said &amp;#34;Wow your teeth are so beautiful. What did you do?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> great if you can keep it off your gums.  Powerful stuff, fries your gums like bacon.  Keep off and you&#x27;re in business!</li>
    <li> This kit does a fantastic job of whitening your teeth. Careful not to get it on your gums though. If you have sensitive teeth, I&#x27;d stay away, or get ready to bear some slight pain and sensitivity. Overall, it is worth it for the results that you get.</li>
    <li> This seems to work well -- the one drawback is that it seems like the &amp;#34;long-term&amp;#34; effects are short lived.  We have pretty white teeth already but wanted to try it for the extra &amp;#34;gleam&amp;#34;... Seemed OK at first but then just seemed like it went back to nothing spectacular after not using it for a day or so.  Not sure if we are supposed to keep using all the product until it&#x27;s done and then see but after using it for 2 weeks straight, we figured the lasting effects would be longer.</li>
    <li> I first whitened my teeth 18 years ago by getting trays made at the dentist and purchasing opalenscence gel from them (About $600 18 years ago).  Been doing BriteSmile every since ($399).  This is just as good at a fraction of the cost.  My husband used the trays since I have my own and even for a guy he had no problems molding the trays (he can have trouble with things like that that require a bit of finese sometimes).  No burning, product worked great, fabulous!  for those who have probs with the light... there is a piece of plastic inside so the product can&#x27;t be turned on accidentally while shipping.  Open up the battery compartment, take that out and viola.. it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I have ordered whitening gel in the 44% before and it always tasted kinda nasty but with a little mint flavor, but this is really the worst tasting I have ever tried and no mint flavor.  Also, it is difficult to squeeze out of the syringe it either doesn&#x27;t come out and then a big blob shoots out.  While this was really the cheapest deal I feel like I gave up some quality and will go with another type next time. I do have to say though, it does work and we are able to use it, it came quickly as well.  The blue lights work but I wore it while we watched a movie and the battery went dead after an hour so I guess that was pretty much a 1 use type deal.</li>
    <li> This product is messy and it burns my gums. I&#x27;m not sure if it even white &#x27;s because I was unable to use it long enough to see any results. Maybe I have sensitive gums, but I can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it. It burns like hell then you&#x27;re left w irritated gums for days.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this product after reading some of the reviews, but if you follow the instructions closely it works well.  I&#x27;ve done five treatments and can definitely see a difference.  My gums are a little sensitive and the first and second treatments hurt a little, but I&#x27;ve become accustomed to the whitening agent and no longer feel any pain.  I&#x27;ve graduated up to 10-minute treatments from the initial 2 minutes.  The kit comes with plenty of supplies.</li>
    <li> very powerful stuff!! Use it sparingly and WOW your white smile!!! This product will whiten your teeth in just a few times of usage. Be careful not to get it on your gums or it will burn like a blow torch.</li>
    <li> excellent quality !!!</li>
    <li> Arrived damaged, contacted seller and they sent out another full package immediately. Works awesome. Be careful it&#x27;s strong and can burn your teeth if over used.</li>
    <li> I must say, TOTALLY surprised at how inexpensive this was &amp; how well it worked. Light burned out before I could use all of the whitener, but for this price, I can just order it again. SAME results as the $600 zoom whitening I paid for at the dentist. Love!</li>
    <li> If you want to burn your mouth, get this product. I cannot verify if it works as it is completely painful to use, and cannot use for the recommended time.</li>
    <li> UPS delivered my order in light speed.  Packed nicely. Everything comes in doubles. So, there is enough for two people.  I am just using one kit and I can gift the other. The whitening gel is strong and Made in USA. There is also an FDA logo on the box.&lt;br /&gt;Molding the upper tray was very easy but the bottom tray took some time. After I cut the extra parts out, the trays fit very nicely. The youtube videos helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It took me only 15 minutes to get a nice, bright smile. I am very pleasantly surprised. They warn you about not using too much gel. Apparently,  too much gel will zinger your gums.&lt;br /&gt;Looking at how much gel I received, I think I am good for at least a year. This is the best value on Amazon.</li>
    <li> hard to get the mouth dishes to mold correctly; but I do think that the bleach itself,is working well</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. She was not pleased with the ease of use.</li>
    <li> Came with 3 broken tubes</li>
    <li> Best whitening agent I have ever tried. My daughter just paid big bucks to get &amp;#34;in office&amp;#34; teeth whitening by her dentist and my teeth are just as white after just 3 weeks of twice per week applications. I apply the agent directly onto the teeth from the applicator, spread it evenly on each tooth, then I recommend using the provided teeth moldings to keep the product on the teeth. Keep product on for 5 minutes to start then increase to 30 minutes if you can stand a little discomfort. To prevent my gums and soft tissue from burning or being irritated, i rinse my mouth with a little water, with my teeth clinched, immediately after both moldings are in place. This gets rid of excess product to prevent soft tissue irritation.The peroxide is dental office strength thus my teeth are sensitive for about 24 hours, but this product whitens big time. I paid $$ for the peroxide the dentist sold me for home use but 4 tubes later, my teeth were only a little whiter. After just 3 weeks of this product, my teeth are movie star white!! No kidding.</li>
    <li> This did not work as well as other whiteners.  I have whitened before and did not get results with this product. Also what I received did not match the description. When I tried to resolve with the company they told me how it was really the same thing and I did not know what I was talking about</li>
    <li> Works great. Just advertised. Saw results in 1 week.</li>
    <li> After two applications, my teeth are noticeably whiter.  For those that complained the trays and light don&#x27;t work......read the instructions.  You have to form the mouth plates to your mouth to create a tight fit.  And the light....there is plastic in the battery space preventing contact that must be removed.  Also, unless my mouth is just that small, there are at least 3 applications of whitening serum in one tube.  If you try to use all of it, it will ooze out of the guard onto your gums and burn.</li>
    <li> every single time i used it, results were right there!! never exceeded 15 min though on instruction they say it can be held on teeth for up to 30 min</li>
    <li> I went out to find the best teeth whitener out there when I stumbled across this one I read the reviews they seemed mixed.  I will say in my personal experience with this OMG IT WORKS.....I drink so much coffee a day and had staining now after just 2 weeks they are white!!  Everyone compliments how white they are and asks my secret!!  I am amazed with this product and will definitely buy it again for upkeep.  I will warm you to make sure you do not get it on your gums and work up to the 30 minutes because your teeth and gums will become sensitive.  I bought a remineralization gel to go with it and it definitely helps!!</li>
    <li> The trays are a bit hard to deal with but the whole process is pretty easy. I&#x27;ve only done it once and already saw results! Great product</li>
    <li> To strong. Hurts teeth and gums</li>
    <li> It does work but it gets messy however you don&#x27;t received 5cc, you receive 3cc. I use siren wrap to get it more on my teeth then my gums because it burns. Thanks to the other reviews that I got better directions and tips.</li>
    <li> I smoke, i drink tea, coffee, and my teeth arent the greatest shade of white. This definitley does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe it for the price! Give it a chance, you wont be dissapointed!!</li>
    <li> Teeth become a bit sensitive if used excessively, but duh :). Have noticed a little difference in color. Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Nice kit.  Not sure about the lights though</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found for teeth whitening, and I&#x27;ve tried many. But keep in mind, it&#x27;s a BRIGHTENER, not technically a WHITENER--it doesn&#x27;t actually get rid of stains, but it will &#x27;brighten&#x27; your teeth, making them appear much whiter. I saw results after 2 uses (non-smoker, but I drink coffee/tea every day), but you have to keep up with it, or your teeth will return to their original color--I use it once a week, no more. I don&#x27;t use it any more, because it is an INCREDIBLY high strength of hydrogen peroxide. My dentist couldn&#x27;t believe it when I told her what I was using. I listened to other users, and applied it very carefully with a Q-tip. Within seconds of it touching your gums, there is a horrible burning sensation. Don&#x27;t ignore it--wipe it off immediately! Hydrogen peroxide eats your skin away, so the longer it&#x27;s on your gums, the more damage you&#x27;re going to have. If I do get it on my gums, they turn bright white for a few hours, but then will return back to their original pink.&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, it really works, there is a noticeable difference, and it makes me feel much better about my teeth. But you have to be very cautious, or you could cause lasting damage to your gums.</li>
    <li> It works, but not as quickly as I was hoping. After a week of applications I was a few shades lighter. I didn&#x27;t have terrible dark teeth to begin with, but like most smiles it could use a little brightening. For the money it is a solid product and I actually have good results unlike the strips that were a huge waste of time and money for me.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best teeth whitening product on the market. It does everything it says it will do. I used it for two day and saw positive results.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the price. I think the instructions should be a little better written. I found that trimming the top edge of the teeth tray. Keeps the product from Creating sensitivity To the gums. Or creating a burning sensation to the gums. I have only done 3 treatments but so far I&#x27;m happy with the product. As stated I believe the instruction should be a little more in depth.</li>
    <li> The light sources are anemic; only one led.  Gel is strong or my gums are weak.</li>
    <li> this really works&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s worth the buy</li>
    <li> Great teeth whitening, it does appear to be working quickly and effectively, I&#x27;ve got sore gums, and can hardly eat spicy food, but that comes with the territory.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Just what I needed to continue the process of getting my teeth their whitest. I look a little goofy but I choose to whiten during my commute to work, solid 25 minutes each day. Took me riight at two weeks.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s great...I havent try it, and  I don&#x27;t know how to use it, just put it in mouth? awesome......LOL</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week. It has really worked and I am a smoker and you can really tell a difference. I would gladly recommend this product to someone else.</li>
    <li> This is amazing I&#x27;ve used it three times and my teeth are whiter, downside my teeth are very sensitive so I have to brush my teeth a few times afterward and you can&#x27;t use anymore then what the directions tell you to put in the tray or it will burn and bleach your gums.</li>
    <li> The gel seems to work, however I cannot maximize the use due to the trays are very difficult to mold based on instructions and the light does not work as the instructions states it should. I tried to use an existing tray that I have and was able to see some results using the gel. I am not able to use the light or the tray. I may have been better off purchasing the gel alone, possibly from another seller w/out having the light and trays.</li>
    <li> This stuff is brilliant... I just put a dab on the end of a brush then brush onto my teeth then put the mouth guard in.. works like a dream. Seller was excellent with swift shipment and never charge a heap of shipping costs. I&#x27;d totally recommend and will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Worked as directed.i love the system.do it on your own time,when you want.the strenght of the solution could burn your gums.depends on how long you leave on.</li>
    <li> product is much stronger than old bleach but once i got used to it i have had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  I was concerned because the price was so low.  I know others had troubles with the mouth pieces but I already had custom made trays from years ago from my dentist so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about making trays.  I product is very strong and I do recommend purchasing the gel so your gums aren&#x27;t as sensitive.  Love this product and the shipping was VERY FAST!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this whitening system. It worked so much better than the one my dentist gave me. The one thing to note that my dentist warned me about is anything over 30% peroxide can be harmful to your gums and cause some gum recession. That is definitely not a good thing. The product is so strong that you really only need about 15-20 minute sessions. I have noticed a slight recession on 2 teeth and I try to be super careful with it. But it really brightens and whitens so I&#x27;m a fan for life : ) Last note, I&#x27;ve never used that light it comes with. I think it may be some marketing scheme thing but it&#x27;s totally unnecessary.  **UPDATE** I just realized the name of this product is different than the one I originally bought in Feb. 2014. The company was Life-Like and I actually received 10 syringes with 2 lights. So apparently this link I bought it from is now selling a different product. So I can only vouch for the Life-Like product and not the one that&#x27;s currently being sold.</li>
    <li> The kit is well priced but the mouthpiece is totally useless. I bought two kits and trashed 4 sets of them.  If you have your own mouthpiece then this is a great value and the gel is top notch.</li>
    <li> Works great! Cheaper option that Crest White Strips. I have barely used any of the gel.</li>
    <li> work really well, like it a lot</li>
    <li> much stronger than I realized  works well for about 15 minutes then begins to be painful. terrific for a quick whitening</li>
    <li> Make sure you follow the directions and use it for everyday ,for at least 3 weeks straight. You will be amazed how white your teeth are after 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> The product works but you only get about half as much as described in the advertisement and the picture shown.  The company shipped 10 - 3ml (3cc) syringes instead of the 5ml syringes.  This is deceptive and deceitful.  I lodged a complaint</li>
    <li> got stuff from the dentist that was less percentage and it worked better. my dentist said that this high of a percentage is very bad for your teeth and can damage them and permanently cause staining because the pores in your teeth are damaged so much from this high of a percentage</li>
    <li> Definite results! Simple you can even share this pack. Works....love it.</li>
    <li> Painful. Was missing pieces. Doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never seen any whitener work so well so fast. It is highly concentrated so don&#x27;t use more than 20 minutes, seriously, maybe skip a day to prevent sore gums. You will see improvement every time. after just a few treatments you&#x27;ll probably only need a touch up once a week. Be careful !</li>
    <li> Well the gel itself works great, but the trays for the teeth are a pain in the ***, so gel always got onto my gums to burn them.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Works well.</li>
    <li> As a long time customer of the famous expensive white strips, I decided to look for something different. And this professional teeth whitening kit was a gift from a friend of mine. I did not know if this kit was for me because my teeth are sensitive but I decided to do a few mini (super short) sessions. First time I put the trays on, it was only for 2 minutes and then gradually I wore the trays for 4 - 6 and 8 minutes. After hese short treatments I noticed how white my teeth are. This kit is no toy, you will get your teeth whitened. But I advise you to be carefull if your teeth are sensitive.</li>
    <li> The carbamde peroxide is a great product.  Like others have stated, it will burn your gums and the roof of your mouth.  Make sure you keep your syringes in the refrigerator to prolong life, use the blue light. (it helps).  The onlly negative thing is those crazy trays.&lt;br /&gt;TIP:  use plastic wrap.  Place a small dot of peroxide from the tube on each tooth, then cover your teeth with the plastic wrap.  That way you get more of the product directly on your teeth and you do not have the discomfort of having those horrible trays in your mouth.  Also, you get less product on your gums,, too.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t tell your friends that you are whitening your teeth, and you will notice that in a couple of days, they will start looking at your mouth when you are speaking to them.  At first they won&#x27;t say anything, but eventually someone will ask, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s up with your teeth?&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
    <li> I recently quit smoking so I wanted to reward myself with whiter teeth. I bought this kit thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work but at this price I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. My teeth were lighter after the first treatment. I did 30 mins on the third day &amp; that was too much for my teeth. Not too much sensitivity but with 20 mins I had little to none. You will not be disappointed in this product. I don&#x27;t use the trays tho. I couldn&#x27;t get it just right &amp; ended up with a little redness on my gums in one spot. This stuff is strong so please don&#x27;t get on gums. I learned the hard way :) I use a q-tip to apply gel then put the light in &amp; I lay down so saliva doesn&#x27;t mix with gel &amp; spread it on gums. This process works for me. Teeth aren&#x27;t unnatural white but it&#x27;s a big improvement because I had a little brown nicotine spot on the bottom of my right tooth that is completely gone now :)</li>
    <li> Before this one I have used 2 other teeth whiteners with no success.  But after using this kit for just 3 days I definately see a lot of a difference. Everything came in a box with good instrcutions. This is an easy to use kit. And I did not have any problems with the trays. The gel is strong and it may hurt some sensitive people. But other than that I can recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this every couple days when I first got it. It wasn&#x27;t until after the first use that I realized just how stained my teeth were. The first treatment got areas of my teeth whiter but not the tougher stains at the gum line. After a couple times of both upper and bottom &amp;#34;bleaching&amp;#34; my smile was brighter.</li>
    <li> So far it is doing a good job love it I would recommend this to any body give it a try</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I&#x27;ve taken under consideration of how strong this product is. I decided to purchase it, since I figured I might try something new, rather than repurchasing Crest&#x27;s whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listening to fellow reviewers, I tossed the mouth guards aside and applied the gel with a q-tip (less than a drop) per tooth and covered my top, and bottom teeth with seran wrap. A few days later, I did it again, but without the seran wrap, and laid on my back to let gravity keep my saliva away from reaching the gel and spreading it to my gums. The day after my second session, my gums were extremely sensitive. I can&#x27;t even use my toothbrush now because they hurt so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT have a history of sensitive gums, and have never felt this kind of soreness/pain before. It really scares me that I&#x27;ve done this to my gums and have never experienced this in the past. I might give this a try again when my gums are completely healed, but as of now, this hasn&#x27;t really whitened my teeth, but left my gums sensitive, after only two uses :(</li>
    <li> I need to hold on this recommendation.  I have used the system eight times and have yet to see a lightening of my teeth.</li>
    <li> It works, I&#x27;ll say that. But man, is it tough on your teeth. It&#x27;s difficult for me to use this on a regular basis, which prohibits me from truly whitening my teeth. I&#x27;m going to just suck it up and get mine whitened by a dentist, then try to change some of my bad habits (coffee, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, not worth it, even though it does work.</li>
    <li> The bleach part works great!  Couldn&#x27;t get the molding trays to come out properly with the hot water.  That was my only complaint.  Fortunately, I had another set to use.</li>
    <li> This product works great.. I think if you read the instructions thoroughly you will have great results. I had been using a gel I bought from my dentist at $10.00 for 3cc&#x27;s. The cool white system&#x27;s gel is a lot stronger. I did notice results after one use. When applying the gel to the trays, use about the amount of a pin head for each tooth. That will be plenty I promise. If you do end up with sensitive teeth, just switch toothpastes to sensodyne. Great product, great price. I would definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> I love the outcome and whitening last long, but i&#x27;m supposing that the mint oil is too strong and burnt my gums, will use cotton in upper and lower front of teeth next time to help prevent that</li>
    <li> I picked these up after reading reviews and realizing they were a good deal. So far I&#x27;m impressed. I&#x27;ve tried other white strips before, but this kit is great and much more affordable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 2 times and see an amazing difference.  I have pretty white teeth to begin with but have lightened a shade or two already.  No sensitivity so far and no burning gums like some of these other reviews.  Maybe my gums are just tougher.  I tingles just a bit but nothing you can&#x27;t tolerate at all.  The trays aren&#x27;t anything to write home about but serve the purpose.  Be very careful when dipping them in the hot water and I would say 2-3 seconds is long enough to soften them.  I had to dip a couple of times to get a good fit.  I also tried the swab it on with a q-tip and wrapping with saran wrap and it worked too.  The hardest part for me was that your mouth waters like crazy and was drooling a few times especially with the mouth trays.  If you can sit still with your head tilted back for 30 minutes, that helps alot.  This will allow you to swallow your saliva easier and keep it out of the trays.  This kit has far better results than the whitening strips and I&#x27;ve tried those several times.  I also bought the reminerization gel to use with this.  Best price too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this you have to follow the instructions very closely. I recommend using Vitamin E Pills or vaseline on your gums before applying the gel to your teeth. It does whiten well BUT I was in pain for a couple of days gums were chemically burnt for a a few days. Just have to be careful with the usage.</li>
    <li> If you have retainers do not use this product. I used it twice. The first time it didn&#x27;t really do much besides for only whiten scratches on the surfsce of my two front teeth that my retainer left.  I was barely able to see the scratches before I used this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I&#x27;d try again in a few days,in the hopes that it would whiten my teeth and even out the splotches is that it left initially.  Oh was I wrong. All it did was highlight all the other scratches that I have on my teeth for my retainer. And now I just have different shade poka dots on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the worst part of all is that it took off some of my enamel as well, something that you can never get back.</li>
    <li> the plastic guards didn&#x27;t soften enough to mould around teeth - and if softened too much melt into a ball!</li>
    <li> why spend big bucks at the dentist. use this instead</li>
    <li> I bought this wanting a convenient way to whiten my teeth, but couldn&#x27;t really use it to even see its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trays+light are so big and awkward that you walk around drooling everywhere, not comfortable at all. Additionally the burn associated with it is like pouring some caustic substance in an open wound. It left my gums white, and a spot of skin I accidentally got it on(drooling everywhere from the huge bulky thing), so now I look like I have that disease that makes you lose pigments in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems really unsafe, to be frank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> As like everyone else, I hated the trays. However I took the advice of the others and used plastic wrap and it worked great. I did get some on my gums and it turned them white for a minute but that went away. Works great though.</li>
    <li> its to painful to use</li>
    <li> It does work.. the only problem is that my teeth are soord and it hurts when i dri k somthing coold but they do work</li>
    <li> It seems like my shipment came overnight! Everything was present and perfect. The best price on the web, in my opinion. If the gel is actually 44% peroxide, then I will be able to skip the professional whitening, and won&#x27;t even have to reorder any gel for a couple of years. I&#x27;m extremely pleased, at this point, and felt that this dealer deserves the above kudos. If I can amend my order after I use the product, I will let others know if this great, inexpensive product is all that. Of course, when I buy from Amazon.com, I am always pleased.</li>
    <li> I have had to cut my expenses down this year and one thing I had to get rid of was my yearly dental whitening at my dentist. I hated how my teeth started to lose their pearl white color so I decided to try this whitening program. The do it yourself trays are easy to make and the syringes are more than enough for months of use. I was offered a free product for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had told me they had been using this product to whiten their teeth. I didn’t believe it when they said it, but decided to try it for myself. All I have to say is, WOW. My mind still cannot get around how white my teeth have become. I find no sensitivity with the product either so It’s definitely an added bonus!</li>
    <li> Very good product! I don&#x27;t recall any sensitivity, and my teeth ARE whiter! I liked it so much that I bought a second one for my sister.</li>
    <li> so far my teeth are much whiter!  I will admit it burns if it gets on your gums.. but not for long after you rinse it, but the burn is worth the results!</li>
    <li> Works good!  I would suggest that you leave on for a few minutes to see how your gums react to the product. For example, I new that it would sting according to the reviews so I left on for about 15 minutes and when I remove the tray, my gums were white,red and swollen. After brushing softely  and rinsing my mouth the color of my gums return back to normal. I saw a little change from the first treatment. Other than that, this product is looking good. I would suggest it!</li>
    <li> This works well and if you are sensitive it will ache some but no more than what I get from my dentist</li>
    <li> I have looked into many teeth whitening kits sold online, and I did try some in the past.  According to my research this product falls right in line with the whitener that dentists use. In terms of quantity, I haven&#x27;t seen any other kit with so many items included.  You actually get 10 extra large syringes of gel. They go a long way if you don&#x27;t over-use it.  If I use just enough, I can get 6-7 applications out of a syringe.  In my very first time, I used too much gel and it oozed out of the trays right to my gums. Using too much gel will just get your gums burned.  The trays can be a little tricky to mold and fit. Not too bad but needs some attention. If you don&#x27;t like the trays, some people paint the gel directly on their teeth.  But I don&#x27;t know too much about that.  There are two lights included with the kit, I use one of them but I feel like the gel would work just fine even without the light.  Overall, this is a good quality kit with a lot of products included – enough for two people.  All nicely packed in a handsome box. I would recommend this to anyone or any couple not wanting to pay hundreds at the dentists office.</li>
    <li> I seriously did not expect a chea product like that to work, but i decided to give it a try because of its price.&lt;br /&gt;I was really impressed by the result, even my friend notice it. Good Product, Good Seller A++++</li>
    <li> Really a great product and although it has only been a week since I have had this product it already shows. The kit is very simple and I only use about a (cc) of gel so each tube last at least 5 cleanings if not more. Great price and really is working very well so far. Once the kit is done I will definitely buy another just to keep my teeth white. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Expect the gel to &amp;#34;brighten&amp;#34; your smile, over a period of weeks. The stuff works, but it will be a continuous effort on your part. Every day, every other day, or once a week, as much as your gums can take. If you have really sensitive gums, be prepared for some tingling and short bursts of pain. No worse than pouring hydrogen peroxide over an open wound (ouch!). The good news is, my gums got used to it pretty quick. The first time, I felt burning sensations. The next couple times, it wasn&#x27;t so bad. Now I can use it and hardly know it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two teeth that are more yellow than the others, so I&#x27;ve been experimenting on just those two. The good news? The yellow is definitely diminishing. The bad news? Well, not so bad, but it will take treatment after treatment until you see a celebrity&#x27;s smile staring back at you in the mirror. However, I don&#x27;t know how long it will take to get to that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s put it this way, if your teeth are yellow because of coffee, tea, smoking or other very staining consumables, and you STILL do those things whilst whitening, your progress will take a very long time. And you will probably be re-staining your newly brightened teeth, making the whole process seem like an exercise in futility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My yellowing agent of choice is iced tea. I drink it daily, and I figured my progress would be terrible. However, I started drinking my tea through a straw, and wah la! I am seeing my yellow disappear slowly and surely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a get-white-quick process, but if you persist, and are careful about how you consume your favorite staining products, you&#x27;ll be quite pleased with the near-celebrity smile you are creating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On side note, my wife says if you&#x27;re teeth are healthy, where you still have most of your enamel, the process will go faster, as opposed to having less enamel (where staining may have been deeper - past the enamel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I use this with my professionally made mouth piece, which is this items only flaw.  Highly recommend having your personal dentist make you a better mouth piece.  Once you do that, this product is flawless!</li>
    <li> This is great for my smile and definitely my teeth has become whiter. It was my co-workers that brought it up and she said it was white and bright which made me feel real good. I did 4 sessions and it got my teeth to where i wanted it. Im also a coffee drinker so this was great for me! I can drink what i want and dont worry about my teeth change colors.</li>
    <li> This product does indeed burn your gums like no other, but wow does it work! I noticed results immediately. Modeling was easy to do just READ the directions. When adding the gel if you think you don&#x27;t have enough on...don&#x27;t worry you do. The gel spreads once they hit your teeth (common sense people). I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Use this product cautiously as it will burn the gums! The product itself works okay, but don&#x27;t expect overnight miracles. I believe I&#x27;m seeing a gradual whiter smile. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks, 5-6 times a week for 15 minutes per day.</li>
    <li> The shipping was quick. The product does just what i wanted. my teeth were whiter after one use and now whiter than ever with just a handful of uses!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, as well as fast results when the product arrives. Words cant even describe how satisfied i am with the results i&#x27;ve gotten from this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on the strips or &#x27;whitening boosters.&#x27; If you want professional results fast, look no further.</li>
    <li> A product that has filled my expectations, protect your teeth and gives lost luster by the consumption of tea, coffee and cigarettes</li>
    <li> I love the 44%  its so strong I don&#x27;t have to leave it on for an hour like in the past.  I haven&#x27;t tried the trays but they are the same trays everyone else sells.  Lights are nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the strongest gel I have ever used...included at the dentist.  Ive seen weaker gels go for $100&#x27;s.  This is the real deal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an RDA and have had experience with different types of bleaching kits.  The carbamide percentage contained in this product is comparable to what you would receive in a dental office.  Take extra precautions while using the product and follow the directions exactly as stated in the manual.  Less is more.  Tooth sensitivity is common with any bleaching system.  Excellent bleaching kit for the price.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first because it seemed like I was getting a lot for my money.  But I&#x27;ve been happily surprised at how well it all works.  The trays are a little thick but I got used to them fairly quickly.  The whitener is phenomenal.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants/needs to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone would ever pay hundreds of dollars on in office teeth whitening. This stuff really works! I would however reccomend purchasing a remineralization gel to reduce gum irritation and strengthen enamel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this system on and off for years.  It is strong so I don&#x27;t use it very often...but it works very well.</li>
    <li> Day one was fine but on day two it literally burnt my gums.  My gums were on fire as soon as I inserted the mouth piece so I rinsed it out quickly.  My gums looked like they were burned with acid.  I am going to try one more time before I give up because I believe this stuff works but keep it OFF your gums.</li>
    <li> HE HASN&#x27;T COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS PRODUCT, SOI GUESS IT HAS WORK FOR HIM. HE HAS REALLY NEVER COMENTED ON IT</li>
    <li> This product works better than any other product in this price range! Be careful not to leave on too long.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Products did not come in a sealed box, syringes were 3cc and not 5 as described I want my money back.</li>
    <li> Thsi is a lot of tooth whitening gel and it&#x27;s really strong.  I got the kit just for the gel and the price.  I already have the trays from my dentist, so I don&#x27;t know how those work.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and intact.Have used 2-3 times and have seen minimal results.Unable to use more than twice a week due to burning and numbing sensations of tongue and gums.Will try to use product at least once a week for 10-20 minutes.</li>
    <li> These did not work. They only turned my gums white and not my teeth. My teeth whiten extremely easily so I thought I would try a cheaper alternative, never again.</li>
    <li> Really I think this works better than what my dentist offers, and for about $280.00 less. Used just a few times a month after the initial whitening period, your teeth will again be white white white.. When I did go to the dentist last month the hygienist remarked on how white my teeth are.</li>
    <li> being a coffee drinker and a smoker well yes teeth get stained we all know this, been using about a week or more doing nice job</li>
    <li> I read most of the other reviews before I placed an order for this kit. There are many happy people but it seemed like some people complained about irritated gums. It kinda irritated mine on the first use but it turns out I put in too much gel.  And the irritation went away in a day or two. I got the desired whiteness in 4-5 uses. Now I use this roughly twice a month to keep it up.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can say that this kit has made a big improvement in the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;You just need follow the instructions carefully and pay extra attention forming the trays.  Given the price it&#x27;s a bargain. I think this is the same whitening product sold at the trade shows for 5x price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just great!  I just put a dab on the end of a brush then brush onto my teeth then put the mouth guard in.. works like a dream. I&#x27;d totally recommend and will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and honestly haven&#x27;t seen any difference. I guess that&#x27;s what you get though for buying teeth whitening product online than from the dentist office. You dont know what they put in those things. I threw them away.</li>
    <li> I thought this was gentle and easy to use for your teeth but it really is not. I burned my gums and made my teeth very sensitive. But it did get the job done for whitening my teeth. I did follow the directions carefully, again this product is not for me. Its all about trial and error and seeing what is the best fit for your self. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> this stuff really works! this kit has more than enough for even 2 people to completely whiten their teeth. its definitely worth the money. BUT BE FOREWARNED about gum sensitivity! if you get any amount of the gel on your gums it feels like acid. if you ignore the searing pain in hopes of whiter teeth, the bleach will temporarily stain your surrounding gum tissue white</li>
    <li> This product is very strong and whitens my teeth as described. I haven&#x27;t experienced any gum pains, like some, but once it did turn part of my gum white. That was very temporary and expected if you aren&#x27;t careful enough to keep it off your gums. I would recommend buying the more expensive custom whitening trays.</li>
    <li> Fast whitening that last. 👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Works great, be sure to only use just enough to thinly coat the guards. I was a dummy and just globed it on there and my gums felt like they were on fire. I like using it one-twice a week and just before a date or I even put some on my toothbrush after drinking red wine. I have it stored in the fidge and I can see this lasting for a very long time for me.</li>
    <li> Works well. Must use often to see results and maintain results</li>
    <li> Teeth are a few shades whiter after one use and are not sensitive. I have used teeth whitening for 15 yrs and these are the best. Seriously, no sensitivity!!!! Read the directions careful before doing the custom mold then you will be fine.</li>
    <li> Works good. Very strong be careful may burn gums if you use too much</li>
    <li> EVERYONE NEEDS THIS PRODUCT!!! I CRIED WHEN MY SISTER USE THIS PRODUCT.I BROUGHT ONE FOR ME AND ONE FOR HER. MY TEETH WERE A NUMBER FOUR ON THE COLOR CHART AND I GOT IT DOWN TO A SOLID TWO....BUT THE REAL CHANGE HAPPENED TO MY SISTER&#x27;S TEETH BECAUSE SHE IS A DARK SKIN GIRL SO IT REALLY SHOWS WHEN HER TEETH ARE DISCOLORED.HER SMILE WAS A NINE ON THE CHART THEY GAVE US.NOW SHE IS A SOLID FOUR.SHE LOOKS SO GREAT.SHE LOOKS SO REFRESHED.....ONLY THING I DIDN&#x27;T USE WAS THE MOUTH GUARDS THAT CAME WITH THEM.THEY DON&#x27;T FIT WELL AND  I DIDN&#x27;T WANT THE PRODUCT TO GET ON MY TEETH.USE ONE OF THOSE BABY SAFETY COTTON SWABS.AND YOU SO BE FINE....GOOD LUCK AND BRIGHTER SMILES !!!</li>
    <li> Mouth pieces are difficult to mold properly. I ended up using wrapping to go around my teeth for a tighter seal. The product does work as long as it is applied evenly to all surfaces.</li>
    <li> The product works perfectly and the shipping was fast.  The Carbamide Peroxide is strong and will make your teeth sensitive, so buy the remineralizer with the whitening kit.  You will be happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I got the box and checked out their instructions and the videos on their web site. The instructions are fairly easy to understand. You need to pay attention the trays and how you use the gel. That&#x27;s it. I got my teeth white and I have no complains.</li>
    <li> Fast service and the product works.  Have used 3 times so far and I can see a difference already ...</li>
    <li> The two lights that came with the kit don&#x27;t work. I can&#x27;t get them to turn on. That was the whole reason I bought the kit to begin with so I&#x27;m very unhappy that now I have to buy new lights.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I used it daily in the beginning to achieve my desired shade.  Once I got to the point I wanted I use it as a booster every once in awhile.  I receive compliments on the whiteness of my teeth from various individuals &amp;#34;Mom&amp;#34;.  I would recommend this definitely to any one that wants an at home kit.  This stuff really works and a year latter I still have 5 syringes!</li>
    <li> The product was delivered to me as expected, However, the gel was too strong for my gums. I tried not to get it on my gums, but that is hard to do. It hurt for several days after using it, so I stopped.</li>
    <li> Works really well. However be very careful to not get it on your gums.</li>
    <li> Came on time, had everything nicely packaged. Just what wanted. The product is great. I have been using it for awhile.</li>
    <li> delivers exactly as promised.  Easy to apply. No burning.  Ointment is easier to use than previously applied product.  will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Wednesday July 3 2013 and received it on Wednesday July 10 2013. I wasn&#x27;t in a rush so whatever. The instructions do warn about a burning sensation if the gel gets on your gums but holy crap it felt like I was using acid as mouth wash. I placed the tray with the gel on my bottom teeth first and it hurt so bad after about two minutes I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and took it out. My gums turned white and I tried rubbing it out and it still didn&#x27;t come off so I brushed my teeth and most of it came off but they were really red. I thought the redness was blood but it wasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s been about a half an hour since then and my gums feel a little swollen and kind of numb. I&#x27;ll try it again maybe with less gel this time and leave an updated review afterwards.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t keep the tray in for more than 20 minutes, it makes me gag.  I even tried it with the gel on my teeth and the light.  I used it for a few days in a row to make up for the shorter time.  I have not seen much of a difference.  I can&#x27;t say it made my teeth sensitive though.</li>
    <li> No other comment is required. I could not use a product that did not work. Not happy. and am even more unhappy that I need to keep writing to post a comment!!!</li>
    <li> It was a prompt delivery and an excellent product.  The instructions are easy to use and understand, all that is required is a pot of boiling water.</li>
    <li> Definitely a great item- use it for my husband and I. Definitely cheaper than paying $ 300. for the dentist Zoom or their mold.</li>
    <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> I didnt received the instructions</li>
    <li> My only complaint, the mouth piece is awkward to use, but Yes id recommend and buy again. Makes my teeth nice and white!</li>
    <li> Burns like crazy. Turned my gums white for afew days. Left my teeth spotted. Would not recommend. Not all reviews are from real customers fyi</li>
    <li> This product does what it is supposed to but takes a lot longer than going to the dentist (for a lot more $$).  The flexible &amp;#34;trays&amp;#34; you mold to your teeth are a bit tricky so you may have a failure while trying, but they are good enough to supply 2 pair which allows for a spare pair if used for one person.  I don&#x27;t know exactly why but the instructions have you start with 5 minute sessions and slowly working up to 30 minutes, probably to see if the chemicals &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; your gums it takes a while to see results.  For me, good results did command it is easy to do &amp;#34;touch-ups&amp;#34; as needed.</li>
    <li> Got this for free with my points.  I didn&#x27;t care for the process and wound up throwing 95% of it out.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> After years of 2-3 cups of joe a day I never though I&#x27;d see my pearly whites white again... With this product I saw results after the first use and by the end of week too you&#x27;d think my teeth we fake they were so white. I love to show them off around the office! Great product. just be carful with the amount you use, if you get to much it will cause some temporary gum pain from the caramide peroxide, but will heal in a day or so. Instructions warn against overuse as well!</li>
