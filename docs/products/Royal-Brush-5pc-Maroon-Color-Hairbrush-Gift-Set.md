      <li>I love the brushes and hope my review will help others in their decision to purchase or not. :-)</li>
      <li>Ok, but you know what?</li>
      <li>Brushes are ok stand</li>
      <li>dollar store can do better.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>it was a perfect gift  for a teenager with long hair.  </li>
      <li>The deep wine red color is beautiful and the holder is great too.</li>
      <li>but they are no longer available.</li>
      <li>It is really cheap looking.</li>
      <li>i thought was metal but cheap plastic and was busted in pieces when arrived someone tried to superglue it</li>
      <li>After 3 weeks all my brush&#x27;s started to break from the handle, I wouldn&#x27;t order these hair brush&#x27;s again, what do you except when you order something cheap.</li>
      <li>I dropped a brush on brush on the floor and there went the handle from the brush, way too cheap of a product.</li>
      <li>Right now i&#x27;m in love with the paddle bush.</li>
      <li>The price is awesome for these brushes and i would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a set of decent quality brushes.</li>
      <li>Whoever sent this had greasy hands and when I received it I had to clean the box with windex.</li>
      <li>They were exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>The price was low which is nice</li>
      <li>The brushes are large, strong, and pretty.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a very rich, deep red and looks really nice in the packaging.</li>
      <li>I really like this set!</li>
      <li>One brush broke when using for first time</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s also edges of plastic that are kind of sharp.</li>
      <li>Really???</li>
      <li>Really like all these brushes, but then I dropped one on the hardwood floor &amp; it shattered.  </li>
      <li>The brushes weren&#x27;t made very well.</li>
      <li>Other than that these are okay.</li>
      <li>It came with 5 brushes, a mirror and a claw hair clip all with a stand and in a nice little clear bag.</li>
      <li>I even love the brush holder; it is as small as it could be, very efficient.</li>
      <li>paidsent this to me at normal shiping rate  </li>
      <li>Were not in New condition</li>
      <li>I have own these for only a few days</li>
      <li>(put one brush used the most in bathroom drawer) rest are just a waste!</li>
      <li>I would really like my money back.  </li>
      <li>im going directly</li>
      <li>To begin with the mirror that came with it was completely shattered in the bag, leaving mirror fragments scrattered throughout some of the brushes&#x27; bristles.</li>
      <li>Looks nice but poor quality .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always losing my hair brushes so having the little stand makes it really cool to keep them all together.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to at least get a product that looked new, even if they were cheap, but the ones that I got looked worn out.</li>
      <li>it shiped early and got here late also not okay on top of that</li>

<li> I&#x27;m always losing my hair brushes so having the little stand makes it really cool to keep them all together.</li>
<li> I was hoping to at least get a product that looked new, even if they were cheap, but the ones that I got looked worn out.</li>
<li> it shiped early and got here late also not okay on top of that</li>
<li> It&#x27;s big and makes brushing out my lots of long and thick hair really quick.</li>
<li> the maroon material came all scratched and comes off easy, my stand was broken and defiantly not worth the money.</li>
<li> when it came i had to pay 5.30  just to pick up my package because whoever you are decided not to put any postage on it and send it withthe most expensive shiping as possible YET it still came late and  was shiped in a box much bigger</li>
<li> The color on them was scuffed in multiple places, some of the bristles were missing in a few of them, and they felt grimy (washed them thoroughly several times before they didn&#x27;t feel like that anymore).</li>
<li> so that was good, but the main brush i need it was broken, also the brush base was broken in 3 pieces and another brush only made it to hair</li>
<li> I ordered these brushes after reading the other reviews and felt compelled to write a review myself.</li>
<li> The only thing that I hate is that when I first opened them several brushes were missing bristles and the paint was already coming off.</li>
<li> Not worth a quarter of what I paid.</li>
<li> I am not very satisfied.</li>
<li> but it wasn&#x27;t too much of a waste of money.</li>
<li> contacts\\&quot; that my friend received  a Half refund of an item that is not ok</li>
<li> The holder is plastic and seems a little flimsy but what do you expect for the price!</li>
<li> Some of the other reviews I felt were a little unfair, you have a small bathroom so the brushes sit in a drawer and collect dust...</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not a good asA gift.</li>
<li> When I ordered these I really wasn&#x27;t expecting to receive a package of high-end expensive products, but I was disappointed when I opened them.</li>
<li> I am NOT happy with this product  </li>
<li> and im NOT happy with the responces from the \\&quot;help</li>
<li> Mirror arrived broken.</li>
<li> and I have already broken the handles off of two of the brushes.</li>
<li> The handles started snapping off from the base off the brushes and now I am down to one.</li>
<li> Really weird, never had a brush do that.  </li>
<li> Terrible quality, the handle has snapped off two of the brushes and the paint is flaking off all the others after a few month of use.</li>
<li> do number 1, it broke after one use. :(</li>
<li> I am very unhappy.  </li>
<li> piece of crap!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After 3 weeks all my brush&#x27;s started to break from the handle, I wouldn&#x27;t order these hair brush&#x27;s again, what do you except when you order something cheap.</li>
    <li> It is really cheap looking. And It also came with a cracked stand. My GF likes it. She said it is worthing buying it because the price. Ok, but you know what? It isn&#x27;t made in China. It made in Hollywood, CA.</li>
    <li> These arrived damaged. I couldn&#x27;t return because it was a &amp;#34;gift from Santa&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The brushes weren&#x27;t made very well. Two of them broke within a week. I am not very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Terrible quality, the handle has snapped off two of the brushes and the paint is flaking off all the others after a few month of use. The price was low which is nice but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful set! It would make a great gift. Don&#x27;t miss is great value. The brushes are large, strong, and pretty. I even love the brush holder; it is as small as it could be, very efficient.</li>
    <li> I was worried when the color was listed as maroon but it&#x27;s a very rich, deep red and looks really nice in the packaging. I bought this for an 11 year-old and she will love them. I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of the brushes because they haven&#x27;t been used yet but they seem sturdy and well made. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.</li>
    <li> Great set and very good price.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes after reading the other reviews and felt compelled to write a review myself. I give these brushes 5 Stars! They were exactly what I wanted! The deep wine red color is beautiful and the holder is great too. The holder is plastic and seems a little flimsy but what do you expect for the price! Some of the other reviews I felt were a little unfair, you have a small bathroom so the brushes sit in a drawer and collect dust... Really??? What did you expect when you ordered 5 brushes, a mirror, hair clips and a holder?  Anyways... I love the brushes and hope my review will help others in their decision to purchase or not. :-)</li>
    <li> Great quality!  Love these!</li>
    <li> To begin with the mirror that came with it was completely shattered in the bag, leaving mirror fragments scrattered throughout some of the brushes&#x27; bristles. When I ordered these I really wasn&#x27;t expecting to receive a package of high-end expensive products, but I was disappointed when I opened them. I was hoping to at least get a product that looked new, even if they were cheap, but the ones that I got looked worn out. The color on them was scuffed in multiple places, some of the bristles were missing in a few of them, and they felt grimy (washed them thoroughly several times before they didn&#x27;t feel like that anymore). I may have just gotten unlucky with the ones I received, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to spend my money on this again if there was a chance of it happening again so personally I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them....</li>
    <li> Really like all these brushes, but then I dropped one on the hardwood floor &amp; it shattered.  Really weird, never had a brush do that.  So pretty disappointed, cuz of course it was the brush I use most.</li>
    <li> this item was just so so. the colored coating scrapes off.</li>
    <li> Came chipped and discolored but i kept it for the price cant beat it. It does it job. So its up to you guys</li>
    <li> I dropped a brush on brush on the floor and there went the handle from the brush, way too cheap of a product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my home salon.  its  really a good buy and great price.  The material on some of he items are somewhat fragile.  But it contains a good variety of styles.</li>
    <li> I love it. Now I have a brush for everything</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift.  Granddaughter loved them!</li>
    <li> I have this set they work great and are well made... But I have a smaller bathroom and not alot of room for storage and to have them out on my dresser is just a dust collector.  (put one brush used the most in bathroom drawer) rest are just a waste!</li>
    <li> Mirror arrived broken.</li>
    <li> I really like this set! I&#x27;m always losing my hair brushes so having the little stand makes it really cool to keep them all together. Right now i&#x27;m in love with the paddle bush. It&#x27;s big and makes brushing out my lots of long and thick hair really quick. It came with 5 brushes, a mirror and a claw hair clip all with a stand and in a nice little clear bag. Taking that into consideration this is a 9 piece set! The price is awesome for these brushes and i would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a set of decent quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Brushes are ok stand i thought was metal but cheap plastic and was busted in pieces when arrived someone tried to superglue it</li>
    <li> I got this product a couple of years ago because I loved the price and color. The handles started snapping off from the base off the brushes and now I am down to one. I would have purchased them again for the price but they are no longer available.</li>
    <li> Were not in New condition</li>
    <li> it was a perfect gift  for a teenager with long hair.  any girl will love it and enjoy it.in bright colors</li>
    <li> The red finish on these scrapes off, they arrived already looking ashy. Whoever sent this had greasy hands and when I received it I had to clean the box with windex. I can&#x27;t be bothered to send it back but it&#x27;s not a good asA gift.</li>
    <li> I am NOT happy with this product  and im NOT happy with the responces from the \\&quot;help contacts\\&quot; that my friend received  a Half refund of an item that is not ok im going directly contact Amazon  my friend paidsent this to me at normal shiping rate  it shiped early and got here late also not okay on top of that when it came i had to pay 5.30  just to pick up my package because whoever you are decided not to put any postage on it and send it withthe most expensive shiping as possible YET it still came late and  was shiped in a box much bigger then the actual item this could have been avoided i opened the  box the stand and brushes handles were all scratched up and the bristles on alot of the brushes looked like they had already been used their for all of these reasons im going to amazon i wont order from you again the only reason this product gets two stars from me is because  of the quantity of brushes NOT quality</li>
    <li> It will make a great gift.</li>
    <li> they look great but ..... you get what you pay for, not alot... they came in on time so that was good, but the main brush i need it was broken, also the brush base was broken in 3 pieces and another brush only made it to hair do number 1, it broke after one use. :(</li>
    <li> I have own these for only a few days and I have already broken the handles off of two of the brushes. Other than that these are okay.</li>
    <li> The bristles fall out of the brush.  I am very unhappy.  I would really like my money back.  Not worth a quarter of what I paid.</li>
    <li> When it came, the packaging was beaten up but the brushes were intact. They work like regular brushes and are relatively sturdy. The only thing that I hate is that when I first opened them several brushes were missing bristles and the paint was already coming off. There&#x27;s also edges of plastic that are kind of sharp. Definitely won&#x27;t buy these again but it wasn&#x27;t too much of a waste of money.</li>
    <li> These are a nice set, but they break very easily, if they are dropped.  I would look elsewhere for an item like this.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes and great deal for the price</li>
    <li> piece of crap! do not even consider buying. the maroon material came all scratched and comes off easy, my stand was broken and defiantly not worth the money. dollar store can do better.</li>
    <li> Looks nice but poor quality . One brush broke when using for first time (bristles popped off)</li>
