    <li> GIVEN AS A GIFT AT CHRISTMAS... AWESOME PRODUCT, MY SISTER LOVES IT AND SHE HAS EXTREMELY FRIZZY HAIR.</li>
    <li> A Christmas Gift...will update at a later time</li>
    <li> This product is fine! I just my comb fit it!</li>
    <li> So far so good!  The dryer is very lightweight, which I love.  Love the pink too!  The price was right as well --- all around a good purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer so much. Pink and black love it. The only thing I hated was that it blew the outlet in my bathroom. Can&#x27;t fix it have to replace the whole outlet. But other than that I fing love it :-)</li>
    <li> Love it - not an overly strong blow dryer which I like because I don&#x27;t have thick hair.  It&#x27;s nice and light so my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired.  No frizz either.</li>
    <li> It works fine, but it has a terrible build quality, it feels chinese. But it&#x27;s a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Turned on this hairdryer for the first time today and sparks flew out and caught my bed on fire!!! Luckily this thing wasn&#x27;t pointed at me or anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DANGEROUS, MALFUNCTIONING PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> best ever! has lasted a long time!</li>
    <li> Product as advertised.  Works well.  Boost button nice feature.  Power switch seem a tad fragile.  I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought it 3 months back. No problem at all. Serves well. Quickly dries my hair. I mostly use it in medium speed. It&#x27;s a light weight dryer.</li>
    <li> Our old hair dryer has seen better days,so my niece picked this one because pink is her favorite color. Revlon is a name that&#x27;s been involved with hair,so I said why not. The dryer seems to dry hair well,and my niece likes the color,so it&#x27;s a win-win!</li>
    <li> Good Product. Does the job well.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift.  I am not sure how this one works because I never tried it.  It was a big hit for the person who received it so it served its purpose.</li>
    <li> This is a great small hair dryer especially to have when you travel</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer for my 11 year old daughter. It drys her long hair quickly and isn&#x27;t excessively noisy. A great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Pink. PRETTY. Powerful, awesome. We do like this dryer.</li>
    <li> I have this for awhile now and it get s the job done after a long while of blow drying. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it supposed to and blows cool air when on hot. The colors are great and it is light weight but if you have thick hair i would recommend spending the extra money to get a better hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I had this hair dryer for a year before it fried out. The best thing about this dryer was it would get really hot and dried my thick hair in a decent amount of time. Truth be told I only bought it cause it was cheap and pink.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer because my other dryer died. I am so disappointed. It may have 1875 watts but it just doesn&#x27;t have the power to dry my hair. My hair is only shoulder length. I have to hold the dryer so close to my head that I am constantly knocking myself in the head with it. Would not buy another Revlon dryer unless I could road test it first.Since that isn&#x27;t going to happen I guess I need to switch dryer brands.</li>
    <li> love this dryer it does the just what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> Revlon RV474 1875W Frizz Control Hair Dryer&lt;br /&gt;My grandma purchased this dryer for me about a year ago .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have a very expensive one given to me by my mom , but it was hers and it&#x27;s very old . So I thought It would be great . WRONG . It doesn&#x27;t blow hardly AT ALL even on the high .&lt;br /&gt;The cool setting is great , but other than that it&#x27;s horrible . And I have thick , kinky curls , so this dryer didn&#x27;t help if I needed it dried quickly to straighten or dried just to wear my curls . It burned my hair and did NOT reduce frizz .&lt;br /&gt;For my little sister , it&#x27;s fine . She has thick straight hair , but it gets the job done ... in about two hours !</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS FOR MY AUNT AS A GIFT. SHE WAS VERY EXCITED TO USE IT FOR THE 1ST TIME AND THE DAMN THING NEVER WORKED. SO I HAD TO GET THE DRYER BACK AND MAIL IT FOR A REFUND ...NOT HAPPY AT ALL</li>
    <li> My 7yr old cousin wanted a pink hair dryer for Christmas, so this one looked good. Im happy to say that she loves it! Its durable, but not so heavy that she cant use it. The color is very cute, and the price was right. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It works as expected. We owned the same model before. This one replaced the one went dead after 2 years</li>
    <li> Not, so good after 6 months started not cooler off</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 3-4 months now and it still works great! I usually use it on the highest heat setting and it takes about 10-15 mins to dry my (shoulder length) hair completely. Its a little flimsy but not too bad, I don&#x27;t imagine it would last more than a couple of years but since I only need it for a year of college it is perfect so far! Very happy with it</li>
    <li> I had this hair dryer for only 3 months before my hair started smoking and I got burns on my hands from the dryer. I will be emailing Revlon immediately. DO NOT BUY-DANGEROUS!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good! except a little bit big</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer about six months ago and was very pleased with it.  It dried my hair quickly, is light weight, is very cute and priced right.  Last week I felt a burning sensation on the palm of my hand and was actually being burned by the handle of the hair dryer!  The pearlized pink color is rubbing off on the handle, only showing a duller pink color now.  BEWARE OF BEING BURNED!!</li>
    <li> MORE NOISE THAN HEAT- NOT ENOUGH AIR RELEASED -  I TOOK END CAP OFF TO TRY TO GET BETTER ACTION NOW I TRY &amp;#34; SOLAR HEAT&amp;#34; WILL BUY NEW DRYER SOON</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it , it does what it says , no frizz , lite weight,cute color ,nice ,well made</li>
    <li> I love the hair dryer it works great I love the color of it and it was a good price .</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is awesome. First off, the attachment makes it easier to blow dry my curly hair straight. Second, it blow dried my hair quick. I had it for a year or two and then one day it started smoking and caught fire. I was totally in shambles and now I use a s***ty blow drier. RIP cute pink blow drier</li>
    <li> This dryer works well for a time, but breaks easily. I&#x27;ve replaced it 3 times! THREE! I bought it because it was the cheapest option, but after purchasing it 3 times, I should&#x27;ve just gone with a higher end model.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s not as strong as I expected, but my hair dries super fast.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my Daughter. Loves the pink color, works great she has used the hair dryer everyday since she has received it.</li>
    <li> It arrived the day it was supose to and it works perfect.</li>
    <li> Works great and pretty color!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I like 3 level of heat.</li>
    <li> I recieved this dryer as a gift for Christmas a few years ago. My favorite collor is pink so of course I was excited.. new dryer - fun collor! I was pleased with the dryer for a while. I recently cut my hair short so I use it all the time now. And with it&#x27;s frequent use... it started to spark. And I mean BIG sparks. I jokingly told my hair stylist about my experience with my dryer and he said that he noticed unusually short hairs in some places. It was burning my hair! He also said that he has heard of other people having the same experience with Revlon dryers. He told me that as many hair dryers as he has gone through in his profesional career, NONE of them have ever sparked.. just quit working. Which leads me to believe that this product is VERY dangerous! Don&#x27;t be fooled by it&#x27;s light weight and cute collor. It will burn you!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old daughter. Works okay but doesn&#x27;t put out a lot of heat. Works great for her, she has short hair. However I have shoulder length hair and it would take to long for me to try and use. Great value, for younger girls it&#x27;s sufficient. I would recommend a better blow dryer if you have a lot of hair or don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend blowing drying your hair.</li>
    <li> Great product as always</li>
    <li> This Dryer is the best i have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;Its light weight , easy to handle and works great on my hair.</li>
    <li> This came along with several other items I ordered. Got here fast and was just hat I was looking for. The price was right and for a 10 year old what a great color. She loved it</li>
    <li> granddaughter loves it</li>
    <li> So far, I like this dryer. Its very lightweight and seems quiet enough. My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t come with a diffuser.</li>
    <li> Love it so far. No complaints that I&#x27;ve come across</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace one that burnt out on me. This one is much bulkier and longer than previous one so I&#x27;m constantly hitting myself in the head. It will take some time to get use to.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer... it doesn&#x27;t get to hot and it&#x27;s easy to hold and use... I would buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> bought this hairdryer for my daughter who ownes everything in pink.  She loves it.  It is light and has good airflow.   She also pointed out that it is not very noisy and of course, the color is just right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Great looking hair dryer and works fantastic.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairdryer and used it one time.  This morning when I turned it on, the element exploded.  Is there a way to get a replacement through Revlon, or will I be stuck with a broken hairdryer that I had to pay for?</li>
    <li> What can you say about a hairdryer? It dries my hair nicely lol. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected, like my last one did. But it&#x27;s a nice hairdryer for the price!</li>
    <li> I got this dryer for my wife because her hair gets frizzy and curly when she washes it.  This dryer gives her the exact results she wants - great product.  She says it&#x27;s easy to handle, nice light weight, has three settings with a boost button for each setting and she likes the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this for drying my fishing flies when I get back from fly fishing.  It really bulks up the marabou muddlers.  We can highly recommend this Revlon dryer</li>
    <li> I bought this product yesterday, and took it out of the box for a test run. Immediately, I liked the color and how light it was. I really wanted to love this dryer, I promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I get it out of the box and unwrap it. Comes with a set of instructions and an individually wrapped concentrator. Never really use those, but cool, okay. I attach the concentrator to the blowdryer, and plug it in - not near any kind of water whatsoever, I assure you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let it blow out air for a few seconds and adjusted the heat. No lie, literally TEN SECONDS after it was turned on, the blow dryer turned an intense red color. I thought it was just a gimmicky effect, but NO -- the heat was spreading quickly toward the handle and it became unbearable to hold due to the heat within miliseconds. I quickly shut it off, only to see SPARKS FLYING OUT OF THE DRYER. FOR A GOOD FIVE SECONDS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, maybe I did something wrong. Maybe it was a fluke. I take off the concentrator just for good luck, and plug it in again. The thing roars to life, becoming red, and starts to shoot out sparks again almost immediately. A few unfortunate strands of my hair are caught in the frenzy of it all, and are singed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t wait until I actually had to DRY MY HAIR to test this item out -- who knows what would&#x27;ve happened if the dryer were closer to my hair????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I got a lemon of a product, but a quick google search proved me otherwise -- check the one-star ratings here, and you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about. A woman on one of the sites I found during my search - search &amp;#34;Dangerous Revlon Hair Dryer Malfunction - PlanetFeedback&amp;#34; to see what I&#x27;m talking about - wrote that she actually got THIRD DEGREE BURNS from her product and is planning to sue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m shipping this thing back, and am never trusting Revlon again. Please, save your money (and yourselves)!! Do yourselves a favor and invest in a different product.</li>
    <li> Works great, not heavy on the hands to use and it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair . I have baby thin fly away wavy hair and this blower keeps it in control with minimal heat . Definitely recommend! As usual Amazon delivers on time or before time.</li>
    <li> Just what my daughter wanted.</li>
    <li> I hate this hairdryer.  I have very long, straight and thick hair, but above my waist.  I have very little patience for the length of time required to dry my hair with this hair dryer.  I have used many hair dryers in my life time and this is by far the slowest drying hair dryer I have ever used.  Don&#x27;t even think about it if you are a busy mom, because I am sure just like me you don&#x27;t have an extra 10 minutes in the morning to wait around for this thing to do it&#x27;s job.  I received it for Christmas and it&#x27;s March, and it&#x27;s headed to the circular file and I&#x27;m shopping for a new hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Exactly like photo. Delivered fast. Great price.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the color pink so I had to get it. Simple speeds as a standard hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Omg yaaaaas it works and it&#x27;s so affordable!</li>
    <li> I love my revlon dryer!&lt;br /&gt;It not just blowdryers your hair with volume, it also straightens your hair:)&lt;br /&gt;Ive always been a revlon product fan because theyre very long lasting and always great products. This blow dryer is a defenite must have!:)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!! It&#x27;s a terrible product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very cute and light on the pockets, I&#x27;m loving it soo far. It&#x27;s a thumbs up for me!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t overthink it, Just get it!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great!!  My hair is pretty long now and my moms hair dryer takes forever to dry it.  This one works pretty quickly and I don&#x27;t get frizzy hair : ) ( I normally do).  I also love the price.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is OK, I have had more powerful dryers for the same price from department stores.I never use the end attachment either. I do like that it has a cooling button</li>
    <li> Works great and is light weight ! It&#x27;s perfect for me to use with my rheumatoid arthritis and it supports a breast cancer awareness so it&#x27;s for a good cause. :)</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is awesome. I cannot believe the shine I get from drying my hair with this dryer! I used to, on special occasions, use a straightener on my already straightened hair, just for the shine effect. I do not have to do it anymore because this hair dryer does it for me.&lt;br /&gt;It takes an extra 1-2 minutes to dry than my old dryer, but it still gets my hair that comes down to my chest done in 5-7 minutes. That is still fast and well worth the shine that it gives.&lt;br /&gt;I dry my hair before bed so I don&#x27;t get dandruff and the next morning, it looks as though I spent hours on my hair that morning shining it. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is the lightest I&#x27;ve owned, and has plenty of power as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again. I use it all of the time.</li>
    <li> worst product not functioning</li>
    <li> Operates like a very cheap hairdryer. We bought for our 10yr old daughter and it&#x27;s fine for her. Takes longer to dry hair than most. We may just have a fluke...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the performance from this dryer. Cool color and light on the arms. Great value awesome product great choice.</li>
    <li> I had this blow dryer for a couple weeks before using it, I used it and stopped working after 2 weeks. Never dropped it stored it back in the box, point being it should not just have stopped working. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> The product quality Is very good and competitively priced...I would recommend this product for home use....easy to use controls and built in safety.</li>
    <li> I have the silver version of this exact blowdryer- i had it for about a year and always used an attachment on the end of it. then all of the sudden the attachment wasn&#x27;t fitting right and so i used it for about a month without it. I have always noticed how hot the dryer got but didn&#x27;t think anything of it. I was blowdrying my hair with a round brush and suddenly smelt burning hair. Much to my surprise, it had burnt that chunk of my hair completely off and i now have a patch of very short, miscolored, burnt hair on my head. HORRIBLE product. I looked at the attachment also and the plastic on the inside is completely melted from it getting too hot. No wonder it wasn&#x27;t fitting anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a long time, and I finally need to replace it. It gets four stars, not five, because while I have never had a hair dryer last me as long as this one, I finally need to replace it because the end of the barrel melted slightly, and the concentrator won&#x27;t stay on. It stays on for a couple minutes, and then it falls off. The other reason is that this morning when I used it, I pushed the cold shot button, and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. BUT I have had it for almost six years! I got it before they put the black on it, when it was solid pink. It&#x27;s the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I have had a similar experience as many other reviewers. This hair dryer has worked for me for about a year now. However, I have always noticed it would spark while I was using it. I cleaned out the back where dust had collected thinking that this may be the problem. This did not stop any of the sparks. Now, I have noticed that I&#x27;ve smelled my own hair burning! Besides all of these problems, this hair dryer is labeled as a &amp;#34;frizz control&amp;#34; dryer. That couldn&#x27;t be any further from the truth. I have never had a hair dryer cause more frizz than this one. Don&#x27;t go for this cheap dryer. Spend a little money and save your hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for the price…have owned it for 1.5 yrs now and still works great</li>
    <li> This terrible hairdryer broke after using it for 3 weeks. JUST THREE WEEK!! I can&#x27;t even return it. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Bought this as stocking stuffer and daughters luv luv it.  Great gift and actually has removable lint screen which a lot of blow dryers don&#x27;t have.  Will buy another one soon because 1 blow dryer for 2 girls doesn&#x27;t quite do it!!!  Lol</li>
    <li> Wish it offered more heat settings. It blows cool air which prolongs hair drying. Would go with a different product.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve ordered. I used my old one for a while, although I thought it would last longer. I blow dry my hair a couple nights a weeks, and it started making a burning chemical smell about a year or 2 after I bought it. It does dry pretty fast however, so I ordered another one.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old dryer with this one, they have the same power but this one doesn&#x27;t get hot, just really warm, not very powerful, will replace as soon as I find one I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
    <li> Only used it for 2 weeks. The bottom piece would get too hot! I got burned a couple times and it also melted my extension cord because of the heat. Total disappointment!</li>
    <li> Even on high, it&#x27;s not hot enough. When you switch to low to style your hair with some control, the temperature is even lower.  It&#x27;s a completely worthless piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I love the heat - It&#x27;s more warm than hot like most blow dryers. I feel like it&#x27;s better for my hair. Very light compared to my former blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer. Found it to be very inexpensive, it works very well. I mostly just use the styling part with the cool air. I did not go wrong in purchasing this product. Love the color pink it reminds me of Breast Cancer awareness.</li>
    <li> I have had alot of hair dryers over the years, i liked this one because it was pink and I could order it on Amazon Prime. However...the highest setting blows more like a medium/low setting which just erks me. If you have thin hair you probably won&#x27;t mind but if you have thicker hair like myself this is just pain annoying!&#x60;</li>
    <li> I like the dryer - I know this will sound silly but the color in the picture is the reason I chose this one but it is not HOT pink as it looks in the picture it is more like a Peto Bismol color. Other than that it is fine.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for she like to do her hair a lot and washes it every day</li>
    <li> Fantastic dryer and no frizz!  I use this everyday and it does all I want.  It arrived on time and as described.  Will use this seller again</li>
    <li> Pleased with everything!</li>
    <li> wicked cute ! great delivery :)</li>
    <li> The cap comes off too easily. Besides that I like it.</li>
    <li> Works well and not too noisy.</li>
    <li> I love this item!!!! Not only is pink my favorite color but one of my close friends is fighting cancer, so it serves 2 purposes but it also work great!!!! thank u!!!!</li>
    <li> Both of my daughters have/had this dryer and both of the dryers melted in different spots.  The dryers are fairly new and seem to be quite the fire hazard.  Obviously there is something wrong with this device since so many people are having this problem.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DRYER!</li>
    <li> Says it has power, but you don&#x27;t hear it or feel it. ???? Just don&#x27;t know, it does dry my hair but think It takes longer that my last&lt;br /&gt;hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Gets extremely hot - I have burned my hand on both the metal grate as well as the plastic body. After use I have to keep on the counter because it is too hot to put away. It has melted 2 different combs and now starts to smoke during use. My hair requires high heat to dry completely and not be frizzy, but this is unsafe and ridiculous. As soon as my new model arrives (not this brand) this is going in the trash!</li>
    <li> I like the blow dryer. I thought it was going to be a compact size but nope its a big one. I love the color and its very light weight</li>
    <li> Super Deal.  Super Price.  I bought this on Amazon after reading reviews.  It works great.  I have no complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after a week, bc it over heats</li>
    <li> works like I thought very good blower</li>
    <li> this was a gift to my daughter.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> This is AWFUL. The WORST inversion ever. I bought this 4 months ago and it never worked! Sadly I couldn&#x27;t returned it because a friend bought it for me. Definitely DON&#x27;T buy it. I fell in love with the colour but I&#x27;m still so upset for the money westing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for almost all 4 years of college and it still works well.  It&#x27;s lasted longer than a lot of friends in my life.  I&#x27;ve had no sparks, no overheating, and have not burned off any of my hair.  I use it to dry my hair after I take a shower and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have had two of these hairdryers now.  The first one I had for a few years until there was a problem with the power switch.  One day I went to use it and it would not turn on.  It worked well enough and lasted for awhile so I bought another one.  Less than 6 months later, there is a problem with the plug-in.  I am unable to push the reset button and the hairdryer isn&#x27;t working at all.  After searching on google, my electical problems with the dryer seem pretty minor compared to all of the people reporting sparks, fires, and/or burns.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find a recall despite all of the complaints online.  DO NOT BUY THIS DRYER!!  You get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I replaced my old one with this dryer. My daughter has one like it and I love the amount of air produced. I have long, thick hair and drying it is a snap with this dryer.</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  Cheaply made, loud and doesn&#x27;t have much power.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.  Save your money and buy the Onel MK-II..</li>
    <li> My wife owned one of these for several years before it died. They are cheap to buy and this one lasted 4 years. It did the job and she liked it. So we bought another one....hard to beat the price and value.</li>
    <li> Works Great!! I purchased this for my teenage daughter. She absolutely loves it:)</li>
    <li> This works great, love the color.  It is a bit loud, which to me is fine, because I don&#x27;t dry my hair at odd hours, but if you need a quiet hair dryer, look elsewhere.  That being said, I love it, dries my long hair fast and that is a must for the below freezing temps we are having this winter.</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly. I love the bright pink shade. Be aware that there is no way to adjust the temperature; only speed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for 3 years now and it works great. I&#x27;m very surprised by reading some negative reviews. I have never had any problems with my hair dryer. My hair is very fine so it gets the job done in 5 minutes. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little loud for me cause I have a baby that takes naps all the time. Other than that it&#x27;s a great basic hair dryer,nothing fancy. Although I did buy mine at Walmart cause it was cheaper</li>
    <li> it is great. It came to my home with no damages and it has a good  price</li>
    <li> I plug it and it doesn&#x27;t work. Just bought it and I never used it before. What do I do with it.</li>
    <li> A great product as long as you do not abuse. Does get hot on high which I don&#x27;t need. Pink is not my color but I bought it to dry my hair when its cold.</li>
    <li> Great purchase! Satisfactory.</li>
    <li> When it comes out of the box and I first start using it, the air is powerful but definitely not hot enough.  So the more I have used it over some months of time the hotter it has gotten, which I really like.  But the last few weeks I have noticed some sparking.  Freaks me out a bit!  I have been buying this brand for a while and my previous ones just shut down after about a year but this ones sparks.  Time to buy another blow dryer I guess.  Sparking from an appliance is never good.</li>
    <li> Works great, stylish and is a great gift for anybody who tends to take care of their hair a lot. Package came right on time, in good condition and holds its worth.</li>
    <li> This is a good hair dryer for me. It has 3 settings, and a cooler button that blows cool air if it gets too hot.</li>
    <li> Cheap blower dryer. It doesn&#x27;t blow dry very hot air but I did buy it for a good price and it works. This is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought it one and half month ago, and it&#x27;s broken And just doesn&#x27;t work now. I&#x27;d like to know if there&#x27;s any warranty to replace this item. So sad...</li>
    <li> So far, a very nice dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old loves this. It is perfect for her</li>
    <li> works great for how low the cost is</li>
    <li> Overall this worked out pretty well but I wish it had more attachments. I should have looked into that more before buying. Otherwise it works alright- could be hotter.  Great color and very light.</li>
    <li> Well, I loved this dryer when I first bought it, admittedly only because of the bright color. However, after using it for a month (I only blow dry my hair a few times a month) I noticed my hair getting more damaged than with my previous blow dryers. Coincidence or not, I&#x27;m not sure, but that&#x27;s not why I&#x27;m rating this one star anyways...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reason for my one star rating is because I gave this blow dryer to my mom when I moved out for college after owning it for just half a year and the first time she used it she burned her hand pretty badly, and it started a fire in the wall where she had it plugged in. She said as soon as she turned it on it got extremely hot and started blowing out sparks. Later that week I called Revlon customer service, who said they had never heard of it happening but would make record of it. I was satisfied with this response until I came across these reviews on here with so many people saying the same thing happened to them, so I decided to contact Revlon customer service again, this time through email &amp; I never received a response. I really hope they are recalling this hair dryer or something because this is just a class action lawsuit waiting to happen, not to mention endangering so many people!</li>
    <li> Lasted almost 2 years</li>
    <li> I gave this hair dryer a second chance after my first one blew sparks at me.  My current one in just 6 months old, taken very good care of, but a clear disk from inside exploded and shot out from the dryer! Never again.</li>
    <li> I have nothing negative to say about this unit.  the longer cord length is exceptional and the many speeds it offers is awesome!</li>
    <li> I really ordered this for the price and color.  I was very surprised to realize how hot it gets.&lt;br /&gt;I never use the highest heat setting. I don&#x27;t think I could stand it!&lt;br /&gt;This dryer gets hot and very rapidly. I don&#x27;t feel the need to go above the medium setting.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t want to trip a circuit or melt it.  Pretty powerful!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this dryer for me for Hanukkah. My favorite color is pink &amp; I have been wanting a new hair dryer. This is very light &amp; contoured to fit well in the hand. I have chronic pain, so this is nice. It doesn&#x27;t make my arms ache or my hand ache from the grip. It&#x27;s much quieter than my old dryer. Just an FYI, though. This is a MUCH darker pink that shown in the picture on the box or on Amazon&#x27;s page for the item. It&#x27;s kind of a cheap looking syruppy dark pink, but not quite a rose pink. It&#x27;s an odd shade of pink, to be honest. It looks cheap. It runs very well, though, and is so light &amp; quiet that I really love it. Still, if looks matter just be aware that this is a very very cheap looking pink color. It doesn&#x27;t even look pretty. I wish it was the pretty pink color on the box, but it&#x27;s not. So, for that reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this same blow dryer from Walmart and it will be going back as it&#x27;s absolutely a piece of junk. It feels like a children&#x27;s toy blow dryer. It is definitely lightweight which is nice and the color is pretty but that&#x27;s the extent of the positives. The &#x27;high&#x27; setting is more like a low setting. If you have extremely short hair and not a lot of it this will probably work fine for your needs.  I have longer hair and my hair is very fine. So I would say for sure you that if you have thick hair or very long hair this is NOT the blowdryer for you.</li>
    <li> I have owned two of this same product now.  Both have started to shoot sparks within less than one year.  Be warned.  This is a hazardous dryer.</li>
    <li> this is a handy little dryer that has every option i would need. pretty and inexpensive..the color is really prettier than my display shows. it&#x27;s kind of a creamy bright pink not light pink</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably had this hair dryer less than a year and already there are gaping holes in the pink plastic body near where the air blows out. Replacing it now as I don&#x27;t want any melted plastic getting in my hair. Nor do I want to smell the fumes! Sorry Revlon, but this gets zero stars.</li>
    <li> sorry..i thought of returing it..but it works in other countires also..i thk its the same voltage, THANKS</li>
    <li> No issues with this hair dryer and its been months. I love it</li>
    <li> I just received this in the Mail yesterday and there is a short in the wire and it sparks...WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great value, great price, light weight, enjoy this one at under $13.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy we have had a similar or same for ten year still work great with the kids need another and we are very happy rate scale from 1 to 10 I&#x27;ll give it a 9 ....</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!  I have owned this hair dryer less than 9 months.  While drying my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair it shut off.  We thought we just needed to reset it on the plug.  After doing that and turning it back on we heard a loud snap.  It burned through the cord near the handle and left black marks on my husband&#x27;s hand.  Thank goodness my daughter wasn&#x27;t hurt.  What a dangerous piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> I just bought this dryer at Target and like it. I had an old revlon ionic hairdryer for several years and felt it wasn&#x27;t working as good anymore. This dryer isn&#x27;t as powerful but that&#x27;s a good thing since i have long, thick, wavy hair. I don&#x27;t like my head to feel like I&#x27;m in a wind tunnel. I don&#x27;t dry my hair all the way because it will be frizzy no matter what dryer I use but I went from 8 mins down to 3 mins to dry it about 75%. I LOVE that it is way quieter than my old one too! It&#x27;s a bargain for the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cute and other 1875 watt dryers seemed to do the trick before. This is just awful if you have thick hair. It is very weak and I can hear things popping inside.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Works great for frizz control.</li>
    <li> Smells like burning hair when I use it, even right after it&#x27;s been cleaned.. Idk</li>
    <li> Heard sparks when I first turned it on. Immediately returned it.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s a novel idea!!  Read the reviews BEFORE you buy this bomb, no matter how cheap it is!!  After a few short months, my Frizz Control little beauty decided to sputter and spew sparks and stink up the entire house because it&#x27;s wiring had burned out completely.  I&#x27;m just very thankful that my hair didn&#x27;t catch on fire!!!  Oh well....it DID last a full three or four months~~</li>
    <li> My wife love it thanks</li>
    <li> My wife says that is faster do her hair with this one. And I can tell LOL</li>
    <li> Awesome Blow Dryer!! It works just like it says. I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Love the color works well</li>
    <li> Purchased for normal use. My wife made use of it like heating machine in winter.&lt;br /&gt;Still it managed to stay live after continuous us of around 8-12 hours.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer. I just needed one quickly so I didn&#x27;t really check it out. I just grabbed it and ran. It dries very well without burning your head off and that is an important thing. I don&#x27;t want my hair burnt but I don&#x27;t want to take a long time either. This one does both those things. I highly recommend it. I think you&#x27;ll like it too.</li>
    <li> I love this Hair Dryer! My hair dries so fast and it&#x27;s really quiet. the price was awesome too. Love it!</li>
    <li> We have had this for long long time, my wife uses this almost everyday and still works very good, she dropped the other day, and still works very good.</li>
    <li> A good product. if this work specially when you need it urgently. I didn&#x27;t come accross any issue as of now.</li>
    <li> Nice price nice product no complaints</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is cute, but has no air blowing power and barely heats to a warm temperature.  I gave up trying to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Arrived and works great - good power, great price, and arrived in the exact time frame and all intact - good buy.</li>
    <li> Great no frills hair dryer.</li>
    <li> excellent product, very good at relationship between Quality vs Price, recommended 100%</li>
    <li> durable but it wasn&#x27;t too hot.. I&#x27;m not familiar with converting watts to sensation ya know? either way whatever its watts, 1800? is kinda cool.</li>
    <li> It do the job like it say</li>
    <li> Received on time and as described. Will use again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hairdryer! It was priced well and serves the purpose expected!</li>
    <li> Great Product and Great price.</li>
    <li> Good for its price, also very light but gives a weird smell when on high temp</li>
    <li> The powers is not as great as previous dryers I have owned. I bought it because it was pink &amp; pretty. Wish I hadn&#x27;t now.</li>
    <li> Love the color. this hair dryer is quite powerful, light enough to comortably hold, fits with ease in my cabinet drawer</li>
    <li> I bought and used this for a year and a half.  The switch has become loose which does not allow the dryer to work.  Sometimes when it does come on--the power is limited and it will not dry my hair.  Though it is affordable-- it is a waste of money!</li>
