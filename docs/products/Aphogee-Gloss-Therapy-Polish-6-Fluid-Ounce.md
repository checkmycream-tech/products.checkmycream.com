      <li>When I found the product on Amazon, I was thrilled.  </li>
      <li>LOVE this stuff - and my hair loves it more....  </li>
      <li>I was glad to see that Amazon still sells it.</li>
      <li>Yes, I use this product lightly on my Yorkshire Terrier&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking !</li>
      <li>It really leaves my hair smooth and silky and never greasy!</li>
      <li>fresh light scent, only takes 2-3 drops, large bottle at great price...and luxurious looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing</li>
      <li>product...wish I had found this one first before wasting money on the others I tried.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly won&#x27;t be using anything but this from now on!</li>

      <li>I began using this particular product sometime around 2000.</li>
      <li>I have really dry damaged hair from a lot of dying and bleaching and I got packets of this from Sally on clearance and apparently they don&#x27;t sell the full size bottles.</li>
      <li>This product helps me tame my hair and style it without feeling oily; it also has a very mild scent;</li>
      <li>(I have curly hair that tends to frizz in humidity, so it offers some smoothness to my hair in those situations.)</li>

      <li>It made my dry brittle hair so soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>It actually has almost completely illiminated snarls in her dry hair, and I don&#x27;t have to brush her as often, either.</li>

    <li> This product makes my hair shine.  If your hair is dull and lost its glimmer you will want to try this</li>
    <li> I have really dry damaged hair from a lot of dying and bleaching and I got packets of this from Sally on clearance and apparently they don&#x27;t sell the full size bottles. After using it I had to buy it here because it was AMAZING. It made my dry brittle hair so soft and shiny. I told my mom she had to try it and she loved it too. My hair is softer than before ever dying it. It works better when you put it in wet hair otherwise it makes your hair feel a little greasy.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely dry and over processed. This product saved its life thank you ApHogee!! .My husband can finally run his fingers through my hair. PRICELESS!</li>
    <li> It really leaves my hair smooth and silky and never greasy!</li>
    <li> Nice gloss and shine but a little too heavy to use in the summer though.</li>
    <li> My only regrets that I did not purchase sooner! You will fall in love with your hair again!  I use this after I moisturize with Aphogee Pro Vitamin.  Prefect sealer after I wrap my hair! Wrap your hair before bedtime daily sealing. Allow your hair to rest as much as possible!  You will love the results from this product without the weight!</li>
    <li> If you want really shiny, smooth soft hair, then this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;Nice fresh light scent, only takes 2-3 drops, large bottle at great price...and luxurious looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product...wish I had found this one first before wasting money on the others I tried.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly won&#x27;t be using anything but this from now on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, but suddenly, it is no longer available in the stores where I bought it. I was glad to see that Amazon still sells it. A drop is all that is needed or it can be almost greasy in one&#x27;s hair. (I have curly hair that tends to frizz in humidity, so it offers some smoothness to my hair in those situations.)</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff - and my hair loves it more....  Makes my hair healthier, shiny and just looks better !!</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s it.  A perfect balance.  Not sticky or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful product that stays as light as gloss can stay, and my curly hair loves it.</li>
    <li> Have used it before.  Can&#x27;t find it at Sally&#x27;s anymore.  Works  for me</li>
    <li> it makes my hair soft &amp; protects it too as I have long hair near to my waist &amp; ride a harley!</li>
    <li> This gloss is perfect and I have tried a whole lot of them. And in comparison, the bottle is also a larger size than any other brand I&#x27;ve purchased. You absolutely get &#x27;bang for your buck&#x27; with this item! Highly reccomended!</li>
    <li> The the shine it leaves in my hair.</li>
    <li> I began using this particular product sometime around 2000. When Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply stopped carrying the Aphogee Gloss Therapy, I was forced to try alternative products.  None could compare.  When I found the product on Amazon, I was thrilled.  My hair and my puppy&#x27;s hair are back to shiney and soft.  Yes, I use this product lightly on my Yorkshire Terrier&#x27;s hair.  It actually has almost completely illiminated snarls in her dry hair, and I don&#x27;t have to brush her as often, either.</li>
    <li> This product helps me tame my hair and style it without feeling oily; it also has a very mild scent;</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking ! Are looking forward to purchasing another bottle as soon as this one gets done.</li>
