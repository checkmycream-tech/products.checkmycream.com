<li> Very useful little tools!</li>
<li> I think these are too long.  </li>
<li> I use clips like these to keep my side bangs out of my face around the house and to keep them from getting greasy from my forehead, and these clips are just too long and flimsy to keep my hair in place.  </li>
<li> Not  strong enough for natural, black hair, can only hold a small amount of hair.</li>
<li> You have to be really careful when removing them from your hair.</li>
<li> If you have thicker hair, they might work for you, but I haven&#x27;t had this problem at all with other clips</li>

<li> Not ideal for coarse hair.  </li>
<li> Cant hold a small section of hairs.</li>
<li> The other 25% snags and pulls on your hair, making a simple process extremely painful.  </li>
<li> Too small even for thin hair.</li>
<li> the worst product i ever purchased.its grip is soo poor.</li>
<li> These clips are the worst purchase I&#x27;ve made on Amazon.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a dog groomer by trade and I use these to pin dogs ears back so I can trim their faces they do not pinch them at all and work great!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> These are cheap little clips but get the job done while hair styling.</li>
    <li> I think these are too long.  I read the dimensions online but from the picture you just don&#x27;t realize how big these are.  I simply expected them to be a useful size.  I bought these because they had some color and they are for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas stocking.  Maybe these are the same size as the others online, but I&#x27;m suspecting they are bigger.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but it is hard to find hairstyling clips in brick and mortar stores such as CVS, Target, ULTA. As there are no specialty stores close, I ordered from Amazon. These were purchased for a good price and do the job.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my moderately heavy hair.  It took me a long time to find them but I am very happy I did.  Now I can curl my hair and hold the curls with the clips.  When you pull them out they don&#x27;t catch on your hair.  The softer flexible ones that look like these will not stay in and hold my hair.  These are perfect.</li>
    <li> it works and you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These clips are the worst purchase I&#x27;ve made on Amazon.  75% of the length of the clip doesn&#x27;t actually hold onto hair.  The other 25% snags and pulls on your hair, making a simple process extremely painful.  There&#x27;s a reason these are so cheap.</li>
    <li> These clips are great for rolling your hair in your fingers and clipping the sections.  Now, all I have to do is learn how to do it!  These are great for holding long hair sections because they are long clips that can hold a decent amount of hair without letting go.</li>
    <li> The clips are made very well, not flimsy. They are good for parting hair and keeping hair up in a bun.</li>
    <li> These are good clips. They hold well and I like that they don&#x27;t snag or tangle in my hair. Their smooth finish helps them to slide right out of my hair. This was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Satisfied! Very useful little tools!</li>
    <li> GREAT  BUY! DEFINITELY  GET THE  RESULTS  I WANT!</li>
    <li> Not  strong enough for natural, black hair, can only hold a small amount of hair. Going to probably give them away.</li>
    <li> Too small even for thin hair.</li>
    <li> The hair does not stay up and it tends to pull the hair.  Not ideal for coarse hair.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> They work perfectly.  I use them to section my hair when I color it.  They will hold that hair until I take it off.</li>
    <li> These clips work as was intended, in holding my hair back in place while I style or work with it.</li>
    <li> the worst product i ever purchased.its grip is soo poor.Cant hold a small section of hairs.</li>
    <li> My wife uses these religiously. They seem to hold up well and even survive the occasional chewing of our mini-daschund.</li>
    <li> Just as pictured. Nice size clip so it holds a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> I guess the best thing that could be said about these clips is that they&#x27;re cheap and colorful and they haven&#x27;t broken or anything yet (though this could be because I never use them).  I use clips like these to keep my side bangs out of my face around the house and to keep them from getting greasy from my forehead, and these clips are just too long and flimsy to keep my hair in place.  If you have thicker hair, they might work for you, but I haven&#x27;t had this problem at all with other clips so I don&#x27;t think the problem is my hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> Great clips, I have thick curly hair and these clips work very well. They even hold on in the shower. I&#x27;ve had them for couple of months and have had no problems.</li>
    <li> Good quality, haven&#x27;t broke yet.</li>
    <li> I do not like that hair somehow gets caught in the clamps and pulls it out.  You have to be really careful when removing them from your hair.</li>
    <li> Better than what I expected.  Great size!</li>
    <li> My hair slipped right out.  Didn&#x27;t do the job I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> They are strong enough to handle a good amount of hair. But you have to remember they aren&#x27;t metal</li>
