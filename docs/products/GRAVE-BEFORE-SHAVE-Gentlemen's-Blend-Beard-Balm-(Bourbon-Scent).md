      <li>The balm is a lighter consistency than what I had been using, which was more of a pomade.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent.</li>

      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I look forward to trying more balms from GBS.</li>
      <li>Nice smooth almost creamy beard balm.</li>
      <li>The scent is more like others</li>
      <li>The ladies love the aroma that is deliver by this.</li>
      <li>have described it being more of a manly cologne scent with hints of sandalwood.</li>
      <li>After more than a year of beard growing</li>
      <li>Love the scent and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy trying as many products as I can to see what others are doing.</li>

      <li>It definitely tames the beard without feeling greasy, and it smells great.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and is quickly soaked up by my beard.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s an amazing masculine scent.</li>
      <li>Keeps my beard in check and makes it nice and soft for the girlfriend.</li>
      <li>Just manly, musky, and cool.  </li>
      <li>They have some great scents (The Gentlemen&#x27;s Blend is my current favorite) that do a good job of not being too overpowering while being strong enough, in the case of balms, to not simply smell like wax.</li>
      <li>My wife loves the scent, which is mild, not obtrusive.  </li>
      <li>In my top three as far as balm goes.</li>
      <li>Soaks in to my beard like lotion is absorbed by your skin.</li>
      <li>All of the products that I&#x27;ve purchased within the past year have been great.</li>
      <li>I also have to say I am impressed with the company: from the branding, the products I have tried so far (Original and Gentleman&#x27;s beard balm), their customer service, their employees, and the overall edgy, cool vibe that</li>
      <li>Scent is good,softens the beard and at the same time does an ok job at holding it in place.</li>
      <li>Even better than my GBS beard oil which doesn&#x27;t seem to have the lasting effect this does.</li>
      <li>It makes my beard soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Another thing that is important to note is that I can&#x27;t really justify spending $20 or more on something that costs a small fraction to make.</li>
      <li>I really like this company.</li>
      <li>Really like this product.</li>
      <li>Before Shave offers a product that is competitively priced and consistent.</li>
      <li>The scent also subtlety sticks with you throughout the day, especially if you are in the habit of contemplatively stroking your beard every once in while like all cool bearded gentleman do.  </li>
      <li>I used the regular GBS beard balm until now (the green one without any specific name) which is great but the gentlemen&#x27;s blend even tops this one.&lt;br /&gt;IMO</li>
      <li>Allows for some basic shaping of unruly whiskers and softens coarse hair but won&#x27;t sculpt the handlebars like a true wax will.  </li>
      <li>I hope to eventually be able to keep at least one of each of their products on hand at all times.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a little harder and gives a better hold to your beard and the scent</li>

<li> and I don&#x27;t really have anything negative to point out.</li>
<li> , my beard has some curves which I could not help, this balm actually made it straight with a little help of a comb and hair dryer, also beard feels a little softer, but I give it 4 stars because the scent is very strong and sometimes annoying and makes me smell like an alcoholic, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.</li>
<li> Gives just enough hold to my beard without making it stiff.</li>
<li> Other balms I have tried leave my hands and beard greasy; not this one.  </li>
<li> Before Shave has yet to let me down.  </li>
<li> Rubs into the beard and distributes easily, not too greasy.</li>
<li> Contrary to what another reviewer (jokingly I think) writes, it does not smell like alcohol, nor will you smell like an alcoholic using it.  </li>
<li> The only scent I wasn&#x27;t crazy about but worked well was the Pine.</li>
<li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all</li>

    <li> Really like this product. The beard balm has a very pleasant scent that stays with you all day but is not overpowering. The balm is a lighter consistency than what I had been using, which was more of a pomade. Rubs into the beard and distributes easily, not too greasy. My beard is pretty unruly with stray hairs,  and this product keeps it nice and neat. I look forward to trying more balms from GBS.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff, smells great</li>
    <li> Nice smooth almost creamy beard balm. Soaks in to my beard like lotion is absorbed by your skin. Allows for some basic shaping of unruly whiskers and softens coarse hair but won&#x27;t sculpt the handlebars like a true wax will.  Don&#x27;t know where the &amp;#34;bourbon&amp;#34; scent comes from, smells like cola flavoring if that makes any sense. I prefer it to my last balm that was waxy and gritty in consistency.  Even better than my GBS beard oil which doesn&#x27;t seem to have the lasting effect this does.</li>
    <li> After more than a year of beard growing I decided to buy this and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all, my beard has some curves which I could not help, this balm actually made it straight with a little help of a comb and hair dryer, also beard feels a little softer, but I give it 4 stars because the scent is very strong and sometimes annoying and makes me smell like an alcoholic, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Keeps my beard in check and makes it nice and soft for the girlfriend. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> Good stuff works and smells great</li>
    <li> I really like this company. All of the products that I&#x27;ve purchased within the past year have been great. This particular product I enjoy as it has a great smell to it and helps keep my beard looking good. This in combination with the beard oil of the same scent is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Great scent, but, balm needs better hold.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It definitely tames the beard without feeling greasy, and it smells great.  My wife loves the scent, which is mild, not obtrusive.  I continue to be very happy with GBS.  Keep up the good work, guys.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent. Freshness with a hint of bourbon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Scent is good,softens the beard and at the same time does an ok job at holding it in place.</li>
    <li> I used the regular GBS beard balm until now (the green one without any specific name) which is great but the gentlemen&#x27;s blend even tops this one.&lt;br /&gt;IMO it&#x27;s a little harder and gives a better hold to your beard and the scent is just awesome.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell like Bourbon but it&#x27;s an amazing masculine scent.</li>

    <li> EXCELLENT BALM. Rich scent, good longevity. In my top three as far as balm goes. Very nice packaging with their tins. This is good stuff.</li>
    <li> I make men&#x27;s products (balms, oils, soaps) as a hobby. I really enjoy trying as many products as I can to see what others are doing. Grave Before Shave/Fisticuffs is probably my favorite brand going. They have many things going for them and I don&#x27;t really have anything negative to point out. They have some great scents (The Gentlemen&#x27;s Blend is my current favorite) that do a good job of not being too overpowering while being strong enough, in the case of balms, to not simply smell like wax. They also have a nice consistency that provides some control without being greasy. The packaging is neat and I believe I&#x27;ve received a sticker with every order. Another thing that is important to note is that I can&#x27;t really justify spending $20 or more on something that costs a small fraction to make. Grave Before Shave offers a product that is competitively priced and consistent. I hope to eventually be able to keep at least one of each of their products on hand at all times.</li>
    <li> Love this beard balm!  Contrary to what another reviewer (jokingly I think) writes, it does not smell like alcohol, nor will you smell like an alcoholic using it.  The scent is more like others have described it being more of a manly cologne scent with hints of sandalwood. Just manly, musky, and cool.  The scent also subtlety sticks with you throughout the day, especially if you are in the habit of contemplatively stroking your beard every once in while like all cool bearded gentleman do.  And although I like the scent, what I love most about this balm is how it works!  It&#x27;s fabulous.  It goes on smooth and is quickly soaked up by my beard.  Other balms I have tried leave my hands and beard greasy; not this one.  It makes my beard soft and smooth.  I also like the hold it gives as it tames and helps me to style my beard the way I wish, especially my mustache. I also have to say I am impressed with the company: from the branding, the products I have tried so far (Original and Gentleman&#x27;s beard balm), their customer service, their employees, and the overall edgy, cool vibe that Fisticuffs/Grave Before Shave has,  I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
    <li> Definitely a must if you are a fan of the beard oil version of this product.  Grave Before Shave has yet to let me down.  The only scent I wasn&#x27;t crazy about but worked well was the Pine.</li>
