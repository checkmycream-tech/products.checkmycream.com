### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best blow dryer ever!</li>
      <li>In addition, the retractable cord on my piece was not doing a very good job of retracting.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s worked great for both.</li>
      <li>Well it has arrived and it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>-Dual voltage is great</li>
      <li>I bought this to travel in Europe and it worked great.  </li>
      <li>This product has been great to me.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair look great too.</li>
      <li>It did work great on 240 voltage though and did a good job performance-wise.</li>
      <li>-Kind of clunky/heavy</li>
      <li>I really liked the fact that you can fold it</li>
      <li>The folding handle was nice and the retractable cord retracted most of the way.  </li>
      <li>I love the retractable cord and folding handle for traveling but also just for storing it at home.  </li>

      <li>and I LOVE the retractable cord.</li>
      <li>I was able to bring it with me to Europe and didn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as there are probably much better hair dryers at this price.</li>
      <li>Given I used this for travel, it also took up more of the 50 lb baggage limit that the airline gave me.</li>
      <li>The air coming out feels nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>and it fit just fine!  </li>
      <li>but it is huge :)  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair so using a hair dryer can sometimes lead to frizz, but this hair dryer has been great.  </li>
      <li>(I travel quite a bit)  -Strong</li>
      <li>The easy cleaning filter is a great feature as I think it makes the dryer safer and last longer.  </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is perfect for everyday use as well as for travel.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Weighs a little more than the old one,otherwise perfect</li>
      <li>it is FULL size dryer.  </li>
      <li>This hair dryer was a full sized dryer that lived up to it&#x27;s expectations.  </li>
      <li>Overall was very pleased with this product and will use it here at home as well as abroad.</li>
      <li>I really like the retractable cord as I like to put away my hair dryer easily.  </li>
      <li>the air is extremely hot regardless of setting.  </li>
      <li>This was the first time I have ever traveled.</li>
      <li>It is really neato!</li>
      <li>For me, it was exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
      <li>; overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will not buy another hair dryer for a long time to come!    </li>
      <li>(I read this on other reviews but decided I liked the retracting cord and fact that it is ionic</li>
      <li>I switched the voltage on the dryer before I left, which was so easy.</li>
      <li>but it is laughably large to have come up on my search for a travel dryer.</li>
      <li>-Feels really sturdy.  </li>
      <li>This made it easier to pack and for the size it didn&#x27;t weigh that much.  </li>
      <li>The folding feature was very beneficial in travel as well as the retractable cord.</li>
      <li>That was the reason I bought this particular hair dryer.</li>
      <li>But it is a decent dryer.  </li>
      <li>This hair dryer is great, although a little heavy.  </li>
      <li>It still works like new.</li>
      <li>not only is it PRETTY</li>
      <li>I live out of the country most of the time and travel back to the US a few times a year.  </li>
      <li>blowing action  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>I dried frizz free, of course I use a gel &amp; silk product.  </li>
      <li>Also only dried my hair three fourths of the way, this is a necessity for anyone retaining their curls and remaining frizz free!  </li>
      <li>(I bought this knowing it isn&#x27;t really small for easy travelling).    </li>
      <li>-Didn&#x27;t realize from initial product description that in order to use the cool air setting, you have to continue holding down the key the whole time.  </li>
      <li>It said in the instructions to keep it on low when using the dual voltage, which I was surprised of how high low was.</li>
      <li>This dryer works well, but it is not travel size, it is a full size dryer with a folding handle, so don&#x27;t expect a small size dryer to arrive.</li>
      <li>With the appropriate plug adapter (I also purchased this reasonably priced set from Amazon: [[ASIN:B00013BL18 Lenmar AC5 World Travel Adapter/Converter Plug Set]]) it worked very well in every location.</li>
      <li>Began to use this hairdryer and find it much improved over my older one &lt;br /&gt;Takes less time to dry the hair and the retractable cord</li>
      <li>It only had one speed with the dual voltage but it dried very fast.  </li>
      <li>It also has a cool button that you can hold down so you can dry other parts of your body as well.</li>
      <li>Good and bad points</li>

<li> The first hair dryer I bought after a year of borrowing hair dryers from roommates and so disappointing!</li>
<li> it is very heavy and clunky.</li>
<li> this hair dryer is definitely not suitable for travel or for drying hair.  </li>
<li> It quickly dried my hair!!</li>
<li> Not a best idea to use for travel.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After 4 years of use the red rubberized cover turned sticky. Cleaning it does not help. It just seems to dissolve.</li>
    <li> This dryer works well, but it is not travel size, it is a full size dryer with a folding handle, so don&#x27;t expect a small size dryer to arrive.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was a full sized dryer that lived up to it&#x27;s expectations.  The folding handle was nice and the retractable cord retracted most of the way.  This made it easier to pack and for the size it didn&#x27;t weigh that much.  I bought this to travel in Europe and it worked great.  It only had one speed with the dual voltage but it dried very fast.  I bought a universal diffuser from folica to go with it and it fit just fine!  I have naturally curly hair so was worried about the one speed, but I dried frizz free, of course I use a gel &amp; silk product.  Also only dried my hair three fourths of the way, this is a necessity for anyone retaining their curls and remaining frizz free!  Overall was very pleased with this product and will use it here at home as well as abroad.</li>
    <li> I knew that when we got to the moon, that someday we would have a cord that did not tangle. Well it has arrived and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Good and bad points; overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will not buy another hair dryer for a long time to come!    PROS:  -Dual voltage is great (I travel quite a bit)  -Strong blowing action  -Retractable cord!  -Feels really sturdy.  This is one that will last.    CONS:  -Didn&#x27;t realize from initial product description that in order to use the cool air setting, you have to continue holding down the key the whole time.  This can get annoying--I wish you could just press it ONCE to change the setting and then release.  -Kind of clunky/heavy</li>
    <li> Not a best idea to use for travel. But it is a decent dryer.  I missed the other reviewer&#x27;s warning before I bought it so I double it - it is FULL size dryer.  It does have a folding handle and retractable cord but it is huge :)  I returned it and bought the Revlon RVDR5005 Ion Select 1875 Watt Compact Travel Dryer instead.  It has all the same features except for retractable cord and it is smaller. Not much smaller - but smaller.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> The item was much bigger and heavier than I expected, and did not dry hair so well. In addition, the retractable cord on my piece was not doing a very good job of retracting. The first hair dryer I bought after a year of borrowing hair dryers from roommates and so disappointing! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as there are probably much better hair dryers at this price.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair so using a hair dryer can sometimes lead to frizz, but this hair dryer has been great.  It has several heat settings, an attachment for straightening and I LOVE the retractable cord. I will definitely look at Revlon again if I need another.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer but it is laughably large to have come up on my search for a travel dryer. It&#x27;s the biggest hair dryer I think I&#x27;ve ever owned - both in size and weight. (I read this on other reviews but decided I liked the retracting cord and fact that it is ionic so I bought it anyway.) Yes, the cord retracts, and yes, it folds. I think in the long run what I will do is keep it at home - because it does dry hair fast - and get another little hair dryer to take along to swim class and on trips.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer.  I live out of the country most of the time and travel back to the US a few times a year.  I just bought a second one of these to keep in my house in the States so that I don&#x27;t have to bring my current one back and forth (I bought this knowing it isn&#x27;t really small for easy travelling).    This dryer dries my hair very quickly and I have nothing bad at all to say about it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. She has only used it for two weeks and is already complaining that she can&#x27;t get the cord to retract. That was the reason I bought this particular hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is perfect for everyday use as well as for travel. I love that it folds up, and the retractable cord is also convenient. I was able to bring it with me to Europe and didn&#x27;t have any problems. Plus, it dries quicker than any others I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> this hair dryer is definitely not suitable for travel or for drying hair.  the air is extremely hot regardless of setting.  it is very heavy and clunky.</li>
    <li> It is an OK dryer. Bigger and heavier than I expected, but works pretty well, dry wet hair in ten minutes.</li>
    <li> Began to use this hairdryer and find it much improved over my older one &lt;br /&gt;Takes less time to dry the hair and the retractable cord &lt;br /&gt;is convenient for storage &lt;br /&gt;Weighs a little more than the old one,otherwise perfect</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is great, although a little heavy.  I really like the retractable cord as I like to put away my hair dryer easily.  It would have been nicer if the handle folded in also for compactability.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product</li>
    <li> The hairdryer is fairly heavy and hard to hold in one hand because of the weight but also because of how big around the handle is. Given I used this for travel, it also took up more of the 50 lb baggage limit that the airline gave me. It did work great on 240 voltage though and did a good job performance-wise. Would I buy it again? No.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for more than a year.  I love the retractable cord and folding handle for traveling but also just for storing it at home.  The easy cleaning filter is a great feature as I think it makes the dryer safer and last longer.  It has plenty of power.  I&#x27;ve used it when I had short hair and long hair and it&#x27;s worked great for both.</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryer ever! I love it - not only is it PRETTY but the cord retracts &amp; then you can fold the dryer in half! It is really neato! It also has a cool button that you can hold down so you can dry other parts of your body as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this years ago as a gift for my mom. She likes it. It&#x27;s not quite as noisy as some dryers and gets the job done. The air coming out feels nice and smooth. It still works like new.</li>
    <li> This product has been great to me. This was the first time I have ever traveled. I was in France. I switched the voltage on the dryer before I left, which was so easy. It said in the instructions to keep it on low when using the dual voltage, which I was surprised of how high low was. It quickly dried my hair!! The folding feature was very beneficial in travel as well as the retractable cord. I will continue to use this product when I get home in America!</li>
    <li> I really liked the fact that you can fold it and it is still a big (regular) hair dryer. It makes my hair look great too. Freez is gone!</li>
    <li> Got this dryer for a trip to England &amp; Ireland and used it in locations ranging from an international chain hotel to a local B&amp;B. With the appropriate plug adapter (I also purchased this reasonably priced set from Amazon: [[ASIN:B00013BL18 Lenmar AC5 World Travel Adapter/Converter Plug Set]]) it worked very well in every location. As some have noted, it is a full-sized dryer so travelers need to keep that size/weight in mind; the folding handle &amp; retractable cord help when packing but it still is a big unit. While I do not have long hair, it is very thick and I need a full-sized dryer...this one, on the low speed recommended for UK use, worked as well as my dryer at home. For me, it was exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
