      <li>The product was extremely strong.</li>
      <li>definitely worth the wait!</li>
      <li>did the top of my hair first to see how my hair would react to it.</li>
      <li>&amp; I normally use Soft &amp; Beautiful</li>
      <li>My natural hair&#x27;s texture is fine and wavy and very easy to over process.</li>
      <li>This is one of the most gentle relaxers that I have used.</li>
      <li>ASSUMED THAT THE REGULAR CREME OF NATURE WAS GOOD</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a biracial young woman who has curly (not kinky) hair; I heard a lot of great things about this relaxer and decided to give it a shot- BIGGEST MISTAKE OF THE NEW YEAR.</li>
      <li>It was very smooth and easy to apply after it was mixed.</li>
      <li>and I love the conditioner it comes with, makes my hair very soft.</li>
      <li>I really wish they would create a light hair dressing  for the scalp.</li>
      <li>My hair was left feeling clean, soft, shiny, with body and bounce with a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>I liked it for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>The added Argan Oil was a nice addition because it feels like you just left a salon when you are done!</li>
      <li>It made my hair feeling soft and smooth and my hair looked soo....</li>

      <li>My nature hair is not fun nor is it cute.</li>

      <li>My hair is Soft, Silky and Straight.</li>
      <li>Normally I use Profectiv Relaxer and products</li>
      <li>My hair has not felt this soft and smooth and manageable in a very long time.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try something new because Organic Root Stimulater was not straightening my hair.</li>
      <li>and my hair felt soft and moisturized  after washing and conditioning</li>
      <li>/&gt;Chesterfield VA near Richmond VA</li>
      <li>COMPLETELY</li>
      <li>/&gt;It made my hair feel soft afterwards.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hair feels soft and silky.</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny and soft...</li>
      <li>After every relaxer it&#x27;s like my hair got even more thick and unmanageable.</li>
      <li>Use the other Creme of Nature products too keep it looking fresh.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin or scalp issues, &amp; I use regular strength due to me having very fine silky hair, I only relax my new growth because it becomes extremely wavy</li>
      <li>Not only did this relaxer give me a chemical burn (and yes, i did a preliminary strand test without any issue) but 48 hours later, my hair is right back to the way it was- only frizzier!</li>
      <li>far as the relaxer goes, I started in the back of my head and before I can even get to the front , my head was on fire!</li>

    <li> Always great, been using product for years.</li>
    <li> Wonderful  relaxer if you like straight silky hair.  Use the other Creme of Nature products too keep it looking fresh.</li>
    <li> Good product. Easy to mix and smooths the hair nicely. Hair feels soft and silky.</li>
    <li> This perm leaves your hair feeling silky and smooth! The added Argan Oil was a nice addition because it feels like you just left a salon when you are done! One of the best perms I have used in a long time.</li>
    <li> Normally I use Profectiv Relaxer and products but I am seeing it less and less in Wal-Mart. So I didn&#x27;t see it and saw Creme of Nature, It is Wonderful! My hair is Soft, Silky and Straight. I have Thick hair. Now its feels less thick and very manageable. I Love my Protective Relaxer but I will continue to use Creme of Nature with Argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chesterfield VA near Richmond VA</li>
    <li> This product is terrible! I have been relaxing my own hair for about 12 years now &amp; I normally use Soft &amp; Beautiful (In the pink box) with the triple hydration oil that you pour directly into the cream mixture. It is fabulous! I recently became curious about Argan Oil so I decided to try this out. Omg what a mistake. A small bit of this dripped onto my ear &amp; immediately I got a horrible chemical burn, I washed my ear 7 times and it still burned even though the product was washed off and continued to burn for several hours as well as the ear on my skin began to scab up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the relaxer goes, I started in the back of my head and before I can even get to the front , my head was on fire! I washed it &amp;washed it &amp; washed it &amp;it continued to burn beyond belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a relaxer do this before and I have tried many brands, some with great results, others not so much but they never burned. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin or scalp issues, &amp; I use regular strength due to me having very fine silky hair, I only relax my new growth because it becomes extremely wavy and I don&#x27;t want to flat iron so close to my roots, so I have no idea why this burned so terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be an excellent product for some but as it being marketed for use with people with fine hair, beware...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: FOR TWO DAYS NOW MY EAR HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY DRIPPING CLEAR FLUID EXCESSIVELY. IT DRIPS ALL DOWN MY NECK AND INTO MY HAIR, MATTING MY HAIR TO MY HEAD. THE SKIN BEHIND MY EAR IS GONE AS WELL AS THE SKIN AND HAIR ABOVE MY EAR IS GONE , IT HAS BEEN BURNED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE WHITE AREA BENEATH MY SKIN. MY SKIN IS NOW BLOTCHY PINK AND WHITEWITH CONSTANT LIQUID OZING AND PAIN AND HEADACHES. I WILL BE GOING TO THE E.R. TODAY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.UPDATE</li>
    <li> This is the first me that I have used this relaxer and I must say I am so inlove with it! It made my hair feeling soft and smooth and my hair looked soo....healthy and It did not leave me hair feeling damaged at all. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Okay it was between Optium Amla Legend and Cream if Nature &#x27;s Argan Oil relaxer I chose C.O.N for many reasons  #1 it&#x27;s a trusted product that&#x27;s has been used on my hair since childhood I&#x27;m now 35.  My natural hair&#x27;s texture is fine and wavy and very easy to over process. After applying this relaxer it was very easy to comb thru and my hair felt soft and moisturized  after washing and conditioning I had little to no shedding it had been 3 months since my last relaxing. My hair was left feeling clean, soft, shiny, with body and bounce with a pleasant scent. I also used C.O.N Argan Oil Wrapping &amp; Styling mousse &amp; Oil Sheen. Which added another layer of protection for my hair. I typically have some type of chemical burn after relaxing but not with this product. I will most definitely use again; I&#x27;m also going to try the C.O.N Argan Oil shampoo and Deep Conditioner. I strongly suggest this product. I really wish they would create a light hair dressing  for the scalp.</li>
    <li> It burned the skin around my hairline. It could be a good product because it didn&#x27;t leave a strong smell. The product was extremely strong. I protected my hair line with Vaseline and only left the hair straightener for 5 min and yet it burned my skin.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN PERMING MY HAIR FOR YEARS AND HAVE USED PRODUCTS LIKE &amp;#34;DARK AND LOVELY&amp;#34;, THE REGULAR&amp;#34;CREME OF NATURE&amp;#34;, OLIVE OIL&#x27;, ETC. AND ALL THOSE PRODUCTS HAVE WORKED GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ASSUMED THAT THE REGULAR CREME OF NATURE WAS GOOD SO THE ARGAN OIL WOULD BE GOOD TOO. COMPLETELY WRONG!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN I SMELLED THE PRODUCT AFTER OPENING IT SMELLED LIKE PURE AMMONIA. I USED IT AND MY HAIR LITERALLY FELL OFF. THE TOP SECTION OF MY HAIR FELL OFF JUST FROM TOUCHING AND NOT EVEN RINSING THE PERM OUT. THE LADY WHO REGULARLY DOES MY HAIR FOR ME WAS SO SCARED WHEN SHE SAW MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT AND LITERALLY IN HER HANDS. I HAVE NEVER EVER EXPERIENCED ANY THING LIKE THIS BEFORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!!! DO NOT USE THIS!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the most gentle relaxers that I have used. I liked it for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. It was very smooth and easy to apply after it was mixed. I left it on for about 10 minutes (as I don&#x27;t need a lot of time because my hair texture is thick,  but not very coarse).&lt;br /&gt;2. The neutralizing shampoo was very effective  it didn&#x27;t have too much lather and rinsed out easily.&lt;br /&gt;3. The conditioner portion of the relaxer kit was fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair feel soft afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;As always, remember that everyone&#x27;s relaxer experience is different. Rinse out at the slightest sensation of tingling.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m into something better now</li>
    <li> I was basically done with relaxing my hair because of hair loss until I found out that I couldn&#x27;t go back to wearing my hair like I use to, and it just so happened that somebody(my mother) told me about relaxers that contain argan are the way to go so I tried it, and it worked. My hair is now relaxed without hair loss, and without me feeling the harsh treatment from relaxer products like the one from Dr. Miracle.</li>
    <li> So this is the best relaxer I have ever bought! My hair came out so nice, it didn&#x27;t make it stringy like others I have used. It was really easy to do!</li>
    <li> I used it, and it left my hair unbelievably stringy, and my hair in the back broke off. . . never again</li>
    <li> I have used this relaxer about 3 times, its a very good relaxer and doesn&#x27;t seem to break my hair like others I have used and I love the conditioner it comes with, makes my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I am COMPLETELY disappointed with this product. I&#x27;m a biracial young woman who has curly (not kinky) hair; I heard a lot of great things about this relaxer and decided to give it a shot- BIGGEST MISTAKE OF THE NEW YEAR. Not only did this relaxer give me a chemical burn (and yes, i did a preliminary strand test without any issue) but 48 hours later, my hair is right back to the way it was- only frizzier! I&#x27;ll be sticking to the olive oil relaxer from now on. Take my advice and do NOT waste your money on this crap stuff</li>
    <li> It works quick and the results are certainly great... My hair is shiny and soft... I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with this relaxer. I wanted to try something new because Organic Root Stimulater was not straightening my hair. After every relaxer it&#x27;s like my hair got even more thick and unmanageable. It was very frustrating. I went on a break from relaxers because I bleached my hair so I could have purple highlights. I gave up my purple because transitioning was NOT for me! I&#x27;ve had a relaxer since i was 13 and i&#x27;m 25 now. my mom had to beg my dad to let me get a relaxer and boy do I remember why. My nature hair is not fun nor is it cute. After I grew out the bleach it was time to find a good relaxer. I love creme of nature products and how they make my hair feel so I thought I&#x27;d try the relaxer. SOOOOO GLAD I DID!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the top of my hair first to see how my hair would react to it. Waited two weeks to do the bottom half. My hair has not felt this soft and smooth and manageable in a very long time. I did have some strands in my comb, but that&#x27;s expected because I combed the conditioner through. I love this relaxer and I&#x27;ll stick with their products until further notice. No burns, no strong smell, no tingling feeling. It&#x27;s very gentle and my hair feels so great.</li>
    <li> definitely worth the wait!</li>
