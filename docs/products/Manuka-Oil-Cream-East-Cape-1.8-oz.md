<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cream works as described. Very fresh, without petroleum additives and other cheap and bad for your skin chemicals. You can put it on your baby without side affects. It is a great healing and antiseptic cream.</li>
    <li> Received it quickly and packaged well. Bought it to help with my sons eczema but no change in his skin. The product is a little stinky like others have stated in their reviews but the smell did not bother me. I didn&#x27;t think it was that bad.</li>
    <li> Works with rosacea, did not cause a flare-up. Is a great moisturizer. I&#x27;ve also used it on a small skin irritation, it cleared it right up. Worked even on a pimple, it was gone in a day. Great product.</li>
    <li> The cream has an unpleasant smell, but it helps with little cuts, skin irritations and pimples.  I have been using East Cape&#x27;s Manuka Oil Cream for years and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read numerous articles about the healing powers of Manuka oil and now I can&#x27;t say enough about it. I recently gave this product a shot on ringworm and in less than 24 hours, I noticed a remarkable difference. My co-workers couldn&#x27;t believe the overnight change in appearance and texture. And by day 2 the skin in that area was just a slightly different color but barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> I stumbled on this product by reading other people reviews. One review directed to this company stating that if you want a good quality manuka products this would be the company to buy it from. Once i got to it, i found another review from the rosecea sufferer like myself stating that it worked wonders for her skin. I have to admit it was true in both cases. It is a great company that offers great products. I use this cream every night i have been off antibiotics for a long long time now and did not have rocesea out flear yet. I was casuosly optimistic when i bought it, but it really works, its non greasy and have almost lemony pleasent smell to it. The delivery was superfast also, instead of 5 to 7 days it took maybe 2 days to get to me. I also bought honey and strong oil mixed with almond oil. I take honey internally and use it as a face mask after extractions. And i use oil on ocasionall bug bites. Very happy with all products, will reorder again.</li>
    <li> I love this and the oil.Does have a scent but I dont mind it. Have bought like 6 tubes in last 6 months. Use on pimples, cuts, rash etc.</li>
    <li> Seriously great product!  Helped me clear up a nasty rash I had from gardening in the tropics!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Been using this stuff for years for scratches, cuts and burns.  This can&#x27;t be beat!!!</li>
    <li> Although the scent is not too pleasant, this cream is wonderful.  I use it on just about anything that causes on itch. e.g. athlete&#x27;s feet, insect bites, hemorrhoids, etc.  Besides calming the itch, I believe it also helps with the healing.  I bought 2 more tubes because I don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> My hubby wanted me to buy this product for the first aid kit.  I bought it and the smell is most foul but, it works like a dream.  It isn&#x27;t sticky like the manuka honey jelly bush.  It goes on nice and creamy and heals the cut, scrape, non deep puncture wound nicely.&lt;br /&gt;  It can also be used as a mosquito repellent, they won&#x27;t come near you when you have this stuff on your skin.  Not many people will but, it does work.  Just wish it had a pleasant scent.  It is all natural so, you get what nature gives you.</li>
    <li> Our baby boy has been dealing with horrible, weepy, raw, bleeding diaper rashes for nearly six months. We have had multiple doctor&#x27;s visits, been prescribed stronger and stronger antibiotic and antifungal creams. We have slathered on every cream, ointment, and paste, from A&amp;D and Desitin to expensive homemade concoctions. We have eliminated every possible allergen and irritant from his diet, switched diapers and wipes, tried cloth diapers. NOTHING healed the rashes. Then on a forum I found stories of manuka oil working on cases like ours. So I ordered this cream and some pure oil. Lo-and-behold, a week after using the cream the rash went away and just dark pink areas remained. Now two weeks later our boy has Beatiful pale baby skin! I had forgotten how cute baby bottoms are! I am so so so grateful to have found this! Thank you! It is now our regular diaper cream. Just a warning, it smells like a decaying animal. I&#x27;m not kidding. But in my case, who cares? Please don&#x27;t change the formula!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Heals skin rapidly.  Works so well, I placed another order to ensure it was always available</li>
    <li> Good stuff my aunt had a rash on her hand...cleared up in 2 days</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle!! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I have used it recently to help clear up a rash on my face! My derm said it was dermatitis and gave my antibiotics and another topical cream, which I didn&#x27;t use. Instead I used this cream and it really reduced the redness, bumpiness and discomfort! Yay! Re-ordered it so I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Arrived quickly in the mail. Thank you.</li>
    <li> have used previously so know how good it is for healing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I applied it to my husbanbs extreme case of road rash. With  in 4 days of application the skin was regrowing and the bleeding &amp; wound wheepnig had stoppped.  My husband is going through chemo so his healing is slowed. His doctors were shocked at how fast &amp; efficiently he was recovering. Great prouduct works miracles on skin abrasions. Many people complain of the odor associated with the manuka oil, even though the odor was there it was much less abrasive than i found in other versions of this product. Long story short this product rocks, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> this product did just what it promised.  It clears up the problem over night in most cases.  I was worried about the smell after reading the review but did not find it to be bad at all.  If your thinking of trying this go for it.  I give it 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> If this stuff works I&#x27;ll never know.  It smells awful.</li>
