      <li>I have used Hyper-C Serum for many years and love it.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Product and  love it</li>
      <li>Love the Jason Ester C product line</li>
      <li>Excellent, have used it before when I could purchase it from my local health food store.</li>
      <li>I also use the same brand&#x27;s day time and night time lotion and they&#x27;re great too!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>One difficulty is finding all of their products, although, besides Amazon, I have been able to find some at WalGreens.</li>
      <li>I have been using these products for over a year and am pleased with their skin performance.  </li>
      <li>my skin looks softer and significantly better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.</li>
      <li>in almost 2 days my skin started to feel softer, healing faster and better</li>
      <li>This is great, leaves my skin smooth and really does minimize wrinkles.</li>
      <li>This version goes on alot more smoothly, with no tugging on the skin.  </li>
      <li>It works great for my skin which is sensitive and oily.</li>
      <li>I am now 67 years old and my skin looks great.  </li>
      <li>I do not recommend this product, as it is too strong and it burns my skin, even using it once a week.</li>
      <li>I think this would be fine until I can afford the MD visit &amp; his products.</li>
      <li>One great aspect of these products is that they contain vitamins that actually work.  </li>
      <li>but I do not know how powerful the Vitamin C is compared to the more costly one from the MD&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I have liked it so much that I sent one to my daughter.  </li>
      <li>Will be back to order more!!</li>
      <li>I purchased this product along with the creme in the Ester-C line because of the many positive reviews about anti-aging and sun damage benefits.</li>
      <li>But for the most part I&#x27;m going to give it a few more weeks and see what kind of difference it makes.</li>
      <li>At some point in between the product changed from a true serum form to a \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; consistancy.</li>
      <li>It helps your skin absorb the moisture more readily.</li>
      <li>I would have liked the product to be a little more penetrating as it smooths over the skin.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of discoloration on my face from the sun and have been searching for the right products to reduce/repair the damage.</li>
      <li>but apparently that happens and is ok.</li>
      <li>43 yrs of age at the first time</li>
      <li>You have to know exactly what your going to do with it because it will drip everywhere.</li>
      <li>This serum may actually make skin better, but I&#x27;ll never know because I won&#x27;t continue using it.  </li>
      <li>As I got older, my pores seemed larger but Hyper C Serum shrinks those mores making my face appear more youthful and taught.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and would recommend it to any one with dry skin</li>
      <li>I have seborreic dermatitis as one of the side effects of strong medications I have to take for lifetime, and that make my skin and scalp very fragile.</li>
      <li>Yes, when I used it almost certainly ended up burning my eyes when I yawned or something.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping to see some small results by this point after reading many positive reviews about how quickly others saw results.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Its really all I ever use</li>
      <li>Most stores  highlight the most expensive and these are very affordable so look at lower shelves.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>G Jason Natural Cosmetics - Hyper-C Serum, 1 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So far seems to be working.  </li>
      <li>Jason&#x27;s Natural Cosmetics i.e. products for women&#x27;s faces contain all the ingredients that dermotologists recommend.  </li>
      <li>As far as anti-aging,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 74 and no one thinks I look that old.</li>
      <li>So far my results have been nil:</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>This product can make your skin soft and supple but doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
      <li>I used this product and my skin went from dry, Dull Looking to heathier, more youthful appearance.</li>
      <li>no changes good or bad thus far.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t had long enough to rate 5 stars, but I like it so far, especially how it feels on my skin.</li>
      <li>Overall I like the product and will give it a few months to see if any noticeable positive changes occur.</li>
      <li>The serum version was thick &amp; had an eye dropper in which case just needed a dime size amount to cover your face, the \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; version has a pump &amp; takes a dime size amount or a little more.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great, leaves my skin smooth and really does minimize wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I started using this product 14 years ago.  At some point in between the product changed from a true serum form to a \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; consistancy. The serum version was thick &amp; had an eye dropper in which case just needed a dime size amount to cover your face, the \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; version has a pump &amp; takes a dime size amount or a little more.  This version goes on alot more smoothly, with no tugging on the skin.  43 yrs of age at the first time I used this product and my skin went from dry, Dull Looking to heathier, more youthful appearance. Now at 57 yrs of age, I still use it to fight the signs of aging and to maintain a heathier looking glow.</li>
    <li> I tried to compare this to products purchased at my former plastic surgeon&#x27;s office. The serum is almost as good but I do not know how powerful the Vitamin C is compared to the more costly one from the MD&#x27;s. It is nice smelling like oranges and comes in a nice pump bottle. I think this would be fine until I can afford the MD visit &amp; his products.</li>
    <li> This works great- my skin looks softer and significantly better. It makes my face glow! I use twice a week.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with the creme in the Ester-C line because of the many positive reviews about anti-aging and sun damage benefits. I have a lot of discoloration on my face from the sun and have been searching for the right products to reduce/repair the damage. I have been using the serum for about 5 weeks. It smells very nice and absorbs into my skin well. It does not leave your skin looking shiny or greasy in my opinion. So far my results have been nil: no changes good or bad thus far. I was hoping to see some small results by this point after reading many positive reviews about how quickly others saw results. Overall I like the product and will give it a few months to see if any noticeable positive changes occur.</li>
    <li> This serum may actually make skin better, but I&#x27;ll never know because I won&#x27;t continue using it.  The serum feels like oil (even though it claims to be oil-free).  When you put it on your face, it&#x27;s like putting oil--THAT DOESN&#x27;T EVER SINK IN.  Your face is like a oil-slick (even hours later).</li>
    <li> I love this product and would recommend it to any one with dry skin</li>
    <li> Bought this to help with my dark circles from poor sleep.  It makes them darker instantly when I put it on (at night), by morning my skin is actually tinted orange, not cool.  Yes, it does feel oily.  Yes, when I used it almost certainly ended up burning my eyes when I yawned or something.  Let&#x27;s face it, anybody who would pay $20+ bucks for 1oz of anything is an idiot, especially a friggin fruit.  As far as anti-aging, I dunno......i&#x27;m under 30.  Made my eyes worse, and certainly not a fan of the tinted skin.</li>
    <li> So far seems to be working.  Dr. Oz recommended vitamin c serums so thought I would try it. Brown color, but apparently that happens and is ok. Great price. Thanks</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00012NI0G Jason Natural Cosmetics - Hyper-C Serum, 1 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for 10 years and I would not start my day without it.  I am now 67 years old and my skin looks great.  My only cosmetics are mascara and lipstick.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for many years. Arrived quickly and was happy with the service.</li>
    <li> Jason&#x27;s Natural Cosmetics i.e. products for women&#x27;s faces contain all the ingredients that dermotologists recommend.

    <li> I love this stuff.  It works great for my skin which is sensitive and oily. The serum helps me stay hydrated without being oily. I also use the same brand&#x27;s day time and night time lotion and they&#x27;re great too!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I could see the improvement in my skin immediately.  And the glow....my goodness.  With several different vitamin c&#x27;s, what else do you expect?</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had long enough to rate 5 stars, but I like it so far, especially how it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great. Product and  love it</li>
    <li> I am fifty and I have been using this product for a few years after a friend had suggested it to me.  As I got older, my pores seemed larger but Hyper C Serum shrinks those mores making my face appear more youthful and taught.  I ordered this product and received it promptly and without problems.  I recomment the product and I recommend doing business with this seller.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past three months and I love it.  I have liked it so much that I sent one to my daughter.  She is much younger than I but swears she can tell a difference in her skin texture.  If you haven&#x27;t tried Jason Hyper-C-Serum you are missing out.</li>
    <li> Cannot tell it has done anything extra to my face.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product can make your skin soft and supple but doesn&#x27;t last all day. I would have liked the product to be a little more penetrating as it smooths over the skin. But for the most part I&#x27;m going to give it a few more weeks and see what kind of difference it makes.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product, as it is too strong and it burns my skin, even using it once a week.</li>
    <li> My skin looks so radiant after using this product.  I am very pleased and will continue using it morning and night!!  thank you!</li>
    <li> I have seborreic dermatitis as one of the side effects of strong medications I have to take for lifetime, and that make my skin and scalp very fragile. Tried this serum and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results, in almost 2 days my skin started to feel softer, healing faster and better so now I have my skin clear from previous black stains it had.  I&#x27;m buying now for others in my family and getting a supply for me</li>
    <li> Excellent, have used it before when I could purchase it from my local health food store. I finally found it again on line!</li>
    <li> I have used Hyper-C Serum for many years and love it.  I am over 70 and have very few wrinkles.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. I use it every day and it takes such a small amt that it lasts a long time. I&#x27;m 74 and no one thinks I look that old. I use it after washing my face and then I moisturize. It helps your skin absorb the moisture more readily. Its really all I ever use and I think anyone who has skin that needs help should try it</li>
    <li> This serum works! I have used it to minimize sun spots and wrinkles as needed and people can&#x27;t guess my age. I had my mom apply it to a dime size sun spot on her hand and over the course of several months it disappeared--no other product she has tried over the years worked as well as this. Who knew? Great product for an amazing price!</li>
    <li> I used it and it caused a rash and inflammation on my face.  I am sorry that I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Dispensor shoots out a big pump of greasy liquid, that goes everywhere. You have to know exactly what your going to do with it because it will drip everywhere. Don&#x27;t know if it actually works because that problem is so annoying I won&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Will be back to order more!!</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, citrus smelling, I receive compliments on my youthful looking skin --I&#x27;m in my post 40-years...</li>
    <li> Love the Jason Ester C product line</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected. 😊</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  When I wake up in the morning feeling tired and like my face is dull all I have to do is wash my face and put this on and the glow comes back.  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
