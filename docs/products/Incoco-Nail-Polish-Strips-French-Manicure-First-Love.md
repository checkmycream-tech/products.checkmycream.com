      <li>I love these nail polish strips, the are the best!!!  </li>
      <li>Just like a good quality nail enamel.</li>
      <li>it was.hard to peel off and didn&#x27;t stick to my own nails.</li>
      <li>but they were in fact my own nails.  </li>
      <li>so I will stay with something that looks nice and keep getting compliments.</li>
      <li>so they would stick on better.  </li>
      <li>I love doing my nails</li>
      <li>So cute, too.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely love them.  </li>
      <li>better choice</li>
      <li>I have always loved the look of french manicures but have not been successful doing it myself.</li>
      <li>simply like as described I juts loved it and the shipment arrived fast nicely covered from harm great dealing with them</li>
      <li>They last me about 2.5 weeks easy - and I do my own dishes and housecleaning!!  </li>
      <li>My nails looked great and professionally done.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands before and not been particularly impressed.  </li>
      <li>These strips make it so easy to do at home.</li>
      <li>They are easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Mine lasted about 2 weeks and came off somewhat easily with nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, never chips</li>
      <li>and I got a free on the spot manicure with the purchase of 5 sets</li>
      <li>and it just makes your nails look fantastic.</li>
      <li>The colors are far more sophistcated, and the quality is infinitely better.  </li>
      <li>6 weeks later still looked good</li>
      <li>I applied the second set on my own and it was as easy as it looked.  </li>
      <li>It is a quick fix if you have somewhere to go and your nails are not done.</li>
      <li>2 weeks later I am still enjoying them and ordering more.  </li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s real nail polish and easy to take off.</li>
      <li>Looks good when you first put in on but doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
      <li>and this makes it super fun to play with.</li>
      <li>Watch the tutorial first!</li>
      <li>but that was easily resolved with a coat of clear nail polish.</li>
      <li>I soaked my hands in hot water</li>
      <li>I love how simple it is.  </li>
      <li>The first set I used took a while to do because I was still trying to figure out how to use them.</li>
      <li>I bought these on a recent Vegas trip and now looking to order more.  </li>
      <li>I can put these on and sometimes they last more than 10 days.</li>
      <li>This is an okay product to buy if you just want your nails to last for one day affair.</li>
      <li>These nail strips are great to put on and last longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>There are a couple of tiny chips, tiny fine lines and not quite as shiny, but overall, they still look good.</li>
      <li>It really stays on for day and days and days.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I recommend these highly and application gets easier with practice!</li>
      <li>I have literally never written a review before, but this product absolutely saved my nails.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>These look so real</li>
      <li>I decided to give them a try since I haven&#x27;t been having much luck with insta gel nail strips.  </li>
      <li>So easy to apply and lasted for a very long time.</li>
      <li>If you get the white tips on crooked you can readust pretty easily.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>My initial reaction was it looked easy enough to apply myself</li>
      <li>Getting the color off took more work than regular nail polish, but considering how long it lasted without a single chip, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>I applied clear nail polish with the second set right after application and I have not noticed any peeling.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply with the DIY video on YouTube, jst a few w minutes and walal, done.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the actual nail color.</li>
      <li>, looks professional.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s looks like you had a professional manicure</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them, they are easy to apply and stay on for at least a week, if not two.  </li>
      <li>Not like the cheap stickers you can buy, this is real polish base coat and top coat in one.  </li>
      <li>I put a clear polish coat over the the polish strips and occasionally renew the clear polish and this stuff just lasts and lasts.  </li>
      <li>I really encourage anyone who is curious to buy one color and give it a try.</li>
      <li>After 15+ years of no nails due to damage from acrylic nails (and, lets face it, getting older!)</li>
      <li>I noticed some areas started peeling after a few days with the first set</li>
      <li>Obviously the picture makes it seem very lifelike, but the white borders are too white and when you apply the clear &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; it looks even worse.  </li>

<li> I have bought a couple other brands</li>
<li> i bought them in las vegas, expected to last at least a couple days,</li>
<li> I just tried the Sally Hansen brand and they sucked and more expensive too!!</li>
<li> I found this brand  not worth the hassle</li>
<li> I had to ask my hubby to help, still not worth it !  </li>
<li> Waste of money believe me.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like the gel as it&#x27;s too hard getting off with all the acetone.  </li>
<li> Too difficult to put on without making a mess.</li>
<li> this was  not a good purchase.</li>
<li> I was tired of the damage/ cost with gels etc and having to take my Saturdays sitting in a nail salon.</li>
<li> I try to use a piece for two or three fingers because these are quite expensive.</li>

    <li> i bought them in las vegas, expected to last at least a couple days, 6 weeks later still looked good and i have been ordering ever since, can&#x27;t get enough&lt;br /&gt;will never use regular nail polish again, french manicure lasts longest, 2 layers at tip, just fyi</li>
    <li> Obviously the picture makes it seem very lifelike, but the white borders are too white and when you apply the clear &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; it looks even worse.  Looks like you have plastic on your nails.</li>
    <li> I found this brand  not worth the hassle it was.hard to peel off and didn&#x27;t stick to my own nails. I had to ask my hubby to help, still not worth it !  Compared to OPI this was  not a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a  similar product for a while.  I decided to give them a try since I haven&#x27;t been having much luck with insta gel nail strips.  I like this product.  I&#x27;ve had them on now for 12 days. I received a compliment on them yesterday.  It takes some practice getting them on.  I soaked my hands in hot water so they would stick on better.  I also tried to wear gloves when I washed dishes, but forgot a couple of times.  There are a couple of tiny chips, tiny fine lines and not quite as shiny, but overall, they still look good. I like that it&#x27;s real nail polish and easy to take off.</li>
    <li> simply like as described I juts loved it and the shipment arrived fast nicely covered from harm great dealing with them</li>
    <li> amazing product!!!!!!  I can do this myself at home and not spend $$$$ at salon.  It really stays on for day and days and days.  Just like a good quality nail enamel. So cute, too.  I get lots of ooohhhh where did you get that done???  Not like the cheap stickers you can buy, this is real polish base coat and top coat in one.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was tired of the damage/ cost with gels etc and having to take my Saturdays sitting in a nail salon. I found this online n decided to try it. I am happy I did. It&#x27;s looks like you had a professional manicure and it also lasted me almost a month. Ladies it&#x27;s easy to apply with the DIY video on YouTube, jst a few w minutes and walal, done.  I did the French manicure. Yet to try the toes, but am gonna. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love these nail polish strips, the are the best!!!  I have bought a couple other brands and they just don&#x27;t compare to these!  I highly recommend them, they are easy to apply and stay on for at least a week, if not two.  They look great!</li>
    <li> I bought these for a christmas party thinking I could get thru the  night. 2 weeks later I am still enjoying them and ordering more.  Easy to apply, never chips, looks professional.  Watch the tutorial first!</li>
    <li> I bought these on a recent Vegas trip and now looking to order more.  My initial reaction was it looked easy enough to apply myself and I got a free on the spot manicure with the purchase of 5 sets so I went for it.  My nails looked great and professionally done.  When I returned to work, my co-workers thought I had gotten acrylic nails but they were in fact my own nails.  I&#x27;ve hand washed my car, dishes and laundry and my nails still look great after all those chores.  I really thought after a few days the color would begin to chip but it lasted about 12 days before it started cracking (not chip) so I decided to replace the color.  Getting the color off took more work than regular nail polish, but considering how long it lasted without a single chip, it&#x27;s worth it.  I applied the second set on my own and it was as easy as it looked.  I hardly ever take the time to write reviews on purchases, but this product is one of the few that really holds up to its claims.  I really encourage anyone who is curious to buy one color and give it a try.</li>
    <li> Too difficult to put on without making a mess. Wish I would have gotten the harder stick ons. better choice</li>
    <li> I have been using the french manicure for about 6 months now and I absolutely love them.  They last me about 2.5 weeks easy - and I do my own dishes and housecleaning!!  I just tried the Sally Hansen brand and they sucked and more expensive too!! I recommend these highly and application gets easier with practice!</li>
    <li> This is an okay product to buy if you just want your nails to last for one day affair. It will not last longer than that. Waste of money believe me.</li>
    <li> Looks good when you first put in on but doesn&#x27;t last at all. Started peeling after day 2.  It is a quick fix if you have somewhere to go and your nails are not done. I personally would never buy them again.</li>
    <li> These did not work for me. They would not stretch to the edges of my nails</li>
    <li> I have always loved the look of french manicures but have not been successful doing it myself. I don&#x27;t want to pay lots of money for it either. These strips make it so easy to do at home. The first set I used took a while to do because I was still trying to figure out how to use them. The second set I used took me about 20 minutes to do. They are easy to apply. If you get the white tips on crooked you can readust pretty easily. Mine lasted about 2 weeks and came off somewhat easily with nail polish remover. I noticed some areas started peeling after a few days with the first set but that was easily resolved with a coat of clear nail polish. I applied clear nail polish with the second set right after application and I have not noticed any peeling.</li>
    <li> So easy to apply and lasted for a very long time. Best manicure I have had at home! Highly recommend!</li>

I put a clear polish coat over the the polish strips and occasionally renew the clear polish and this stuff just lasts and lasts.  Can&#x27;t say enough about it!</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and this makes it super fun to play with. I love how simple it is.  I try to use a piece for two or three fingers because these are quite expensive. You don&#x27;t get that bump on the tip of your nails like when you use nail polish and it just makes your nails look fantastic. I don&#x27;t really care for the actual nail color. I like the white strip because it has a solid line for you to apply on the nail.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands before and not been particularly impressed.  Initially, it was the availabilty of the \\&quot;french tip\\&quot; that drew me to Incoco.  After using them, I won&#x27;t use another brand again. The colors are far more sophistcated, and the quality is infinitely better.  For whatever reason, my nails are prone to chipping; no matter what I do, a manicure usually doesn&#x27;t last me the weekend.  I had my Incoco manicure for 3 weeks!  I also received several compliments and friends asking me where I got my nails done, they looked that \\&quot;professional.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I can put these on and sometimes they last more than 10 days. People always think I&#x27;ve had my nails done.  One time when I did go to have the gel nails applied, the manicuriest got the foil and remover to take my Incoco French Manicure off!!!  I don&#x27;t like the gel as it&#x27;s too hard getting off with all the acetone.  These look so real so I will stay with something that looks nice and keep getting compliments.</li>
