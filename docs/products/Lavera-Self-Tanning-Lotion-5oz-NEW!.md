      <li>I used this before for the face,and im glad i bought this one for the body.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Nothing much more than a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>you can buy from USa but it is way more expansive</li>
      <li>you must put it on in a circular motion to make sure you are covered without having streaks.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This Lavera tanner is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty good product.  </li>
      <li>I love that it looks natural not orange, does not streak &amp; the scent is pleasant.</li>
      <li>Infused with Macadamia seed oil and  shea butter help in moisturizing and smooth application of the product with no streaking or patching.</li>
      <li>I had a couple of people ask me how I got such as great tan.</li>
      <li>Fabulous formula.</li>
      <li>Seems free of harmful chemicals, too.</li>
      <li>The color looks natural and the smell is good.  </li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t a familiar smell.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually use self-tanners, but I decided to give this one a try after spending hours searching for an all-nautral product, and this one had the best reviews.</li>
      <li>Pretty color but have to apply more than 3 times a week to keep desired color.</li>
      <li>Clean, clean, clean ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I was really impressed the first few times I used it.</li>
      <li>Nice, even, natural tan look.  </li>
      <li>I woukd like a full refund.</li>
      <li>When you first apply it, it smells fine, like a cinnamon chai latte.</li>
      <li>My favorite new product.</li>
      <li>After an hour you and your clothes have that distinct self tanner smell.</li>
      <li>Natural golden glow, no streaks, and a pleasant smell that barely lingers.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have many of the chemicals that so many other lotions seem to have.</li>
      <li>I really wanted a tanning product that was more natural, so after some research I found this one.</li>
      <li>This self tanning lotion is easy to use, looks natural, and lasts for about a week before it becomes faded.</li>
      <li>I am extremely fair, and no-one should have to experience my legs without a little color.</li>
      <li>It lasts pretty well.</li>
      <li>This works very well.</li>
      <li>I have not used it any where else yet, again too nervous, but I think it is definatley worth a shot if you are looking for a natural self tanner.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this self tanner!</li>
      <li>I was very nervous, as with any self tanner, as one never knows how the skin will react.</li>
      <li>but it really does the job</li>
      <li>I wish I could get this lotion without having to pay so much</li>
      <li>I really like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use this lotion everyday to maintain a nice tan.</li>
      <li>Better than cancer from other chemical lotions or the sun</li>
      <li>and like how it smoothes out the color of my skin, creating a nice consistency, with the dark and light spots on my skin becoming far less apparent.</li>
      <li>When I first spotted this on Amazon, there was no way I was paying the hefty shipping charge that particular seller was charging, but when I checked a month or so later, I saw this offered via Prime &amp; jumped right on it.  </li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s missing parabens and other not so healthy ingredients.  </li>
      <li>:) Back home, back in the office, way less sun, and reapplying this lotion gives me an OK look.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
      <li>Best natural self tanner,looks very natural,not orange and doesnt smell too bad.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned, though, so it might be unnecessary to do that for darker skinned people.</li>
      <li>live in Florida</li>
      <li>Nice subtle color that doesn&#x27;t smell like some self-tanners.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>All natural alternative we&#x27;ve  been using for yrs!</li>
      <li>I bought this tanner and Sun Laboratories tanner at the exact same time.  </li>
      <li>Washes off easily with a little soap if you do not want it on.  </li>
      <li>This natural self tanner is vegan friendly and is free from parabens, artificial fragrances and colors.</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous self tanners &amp; gradual tanners - dept store/Sephora types (Clarins, Lancôme, Fake Bake, etc) as well as ones from the health food stores, Target, etc - This is by far a much more natural FAST tan for my shockingly white legs.  </li>
      <li>the first time got my face TOO dark (</li>
      <li>although barely noticeable and</li>
      <li>I have pretty pale skin and had not been in the sun for months when I used this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This self tanner works great!  No smell like the others I have tried.  Nice, even, natural tan look.  This is a product I will use year after year!</li>
    <li> The best self tanning cream I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t contain a gazillion chemicals.</li>
    <li> Best natural self tanner,looks very natural,not orange and doesnt smell too bad. I used this before for the face,and im glad i bought this one for the body. It leaves a suttle nice glow,didnt try reapplying to see if it would get darker,but ill try!</li>
    <li> No color change... not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Feels good All organic but doesn;t last long &amp; expensive! I will not buy this again</li>
    <li> I wish I could get this lotion without having to pay so much but it really does the job well.  It doesn&#x27;t have many of the chemicals that so many other lotions seem to have. There is no stinky smell like many have AND it is the best brown tone I have ever had. No orangey or streaky look to it at all.  I am very fair skinned and it looks natural. Love it!</li>
    <li> The product smells like self tanner. When you first apply it, it smells fine, like a cinnamon chai latte. After an hour you and your clothes have that distinct self tanner smell. If you are looking for an odorless product, this is not it.</li>
    <li> I bought this tanner and Sun Laboratories tanner at the exact same time.  This Lavera tanner is my favorite.  It didn&#x27;t break my face out at all and I am allergic to everything from hair dyes to perfumes and creams.  This goes on like a cream...you must put it on in a circular motion to make sure you are covered without having streaks.  Love it.  I can&#x27;t describe the smell to you,...it isn&#x27;t a familiar smell.  But my husband liked it on me.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t last but a day or so</li>
    <li> My favorite new product. Even color and very little scent. Goes on and feels like body lotion. I will order again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use self-tanners, but I decided to give this one a try after spending hours searching for an all-nautral product, and this one had the best reviews. I have pretty pale skin and had not been in the sun for months when I used this. I was very nervous, as with any self tanner, as one never knows how the skin will react. I used it on my legs, and it did give me color but it was just the slightest orange hue although barely noticeable and my husband did not even notice I had to point it out to him. I have not used it any where else yet, again too nervous, but I think it is definatley worth a shot if you are looking for a natural self tanner.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I was sure to exfoliate well and apply evenly. It made my legs perfectly tan in one application.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this tanning lotion for years.  I am fair skinned and it gives me a nice soft color; I feel more attractive wearing my golf clothes, etc.</li>
    <li> This is the only self tanner I use now. Natural golden glow, no streaks, and a pleasant smell that barely lingers.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product.  It&#x27;s great for moisturizing as well as a tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, too!</li>
    <li> This works very well. Does not look fake or  give a fake orange look.  You get great coverage and you can control the intensity of the tan. I work my way up to a nice tan.</li>
    <li> I am so naturally pale it took me a couple of coats and days to see a nice color.&lt;br /&gt;Now I alwis have a nice glow and not ashemed to wear my bathing suit at beach.&lt;br /&gt;i live in Florida where is nice 360 days of the year and the beach is a must.&lt;br /&gt;will be buying endless supplies of this product as I ordered from England and it taked two weeks to receive it in the mail. you can buy from USa but it is way more expansive</li>
    <li> Nice subtle color that doesn&#x27;t smell like some self-tanners. Seems free of harmful chemicals, too.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. No DHA smell.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, did work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this lotion because it works and it is toxin free! I have very fair skin therefore it only took a very small amount of lotion to give me a slight glow. If you apply the lotion in line with the directions you will not be disappointed. I really like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use this lotion everyday to maintain a nice tan. The lotion leaves a bronzed sunkissed tone -- void of any orange hues. This product is a great value for the price paid. Buy it!</li>
    <li> This natural self tanner is vegan friendly and is free from parabens, artificial fragrances and colors. This product will give you a tan of your dreams in just 3 hours. Infused with Macadamia seed oil and  shea butter help in moisturizing and smooth application of the product with no streaking or patching. This product is also known for its wonderful smell and color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reviewed few other natural summer essentials on my blog. Here is the link&lt;br /&gt;http://dreaminloud.com/natural-skin-care/summer-beauty-essentials/</li>
    <li> Pretty color but have to apply more than 3 times a week to keep desired color. The bottle is too small to keep the color up for a month. I love the color and its very safe to use but many bottles should be purchased at once.</li>
    <li> It gives decent color being that I&#x27;m very fair. But the smell is sooooo off putting . I&#x27;ll be trying something different . The ingredients are OK. But still questionable. Linalool and geraniol ??</li>
    <li> Fantastic self tanner!  Love that it&#x27;s missing parabens and other not so healthy ingredients.  The color looks natural and the smell is good.  It lasts several days to a week....</li>
    <li> This self tanning lotion is easy to use, looks natural, and lasts for about a week before it becomes faded. I&#x27;ve used it for about a year and a half and like how it smoothes out the color of my skin, creating a nice consistency, with the dark and light spots on my skin becoming far less apparent. This lotion is a wonderful alternative to using facial foundation makeup.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed the first few times I used it. I noticed this stuff worked best when I was in Hawaii. I wore factor 30 on the beach, but my skin was still getting some sun. Then I applied this a couple of times towards the end of the week. The tan looked really good. I had a couple of people ask me how I got such as great tan. :) Back home, back in the office, way less sun, and reapplying this lotion gives me an OK look. I had a couple of instances where I got some very dark patches during the fading process that were hard to shift. I am extremely fair, and no-one should have to experience my legs without a little color. I like the low/no chemical content. If that&#x27;s you too - I recommend this!</li>
    <li> Slightly orange, takes at least two days to notice change... Better than cancer from other chemical lotions or the sun</li>
    <li> I have an allergic reaction to the DHA in most self-tanning lotions.  I have been able to successfully use this one.  It is gradual, but great and doesn&#x27;t smell awful like the rest.  I have stocked up on this and plan to continue using.  I use two to three days in a row and then take a week off.  It lasts pretty well.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this self tanner! All natural alternative we&#x27;ve  been using for yrs! No stain, no smell. The best!</li>
    <li> Best Natural Ingredients I have found in a Tanning Lotion.  Works lovely when you want a temporary tan.  Washes off easily with a little soap if you do not want it on.  So glad for this amazing discovery.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous self tanners &amp; gradual tanners - dept store/Sephora types (Clarins, Lancôme, Fake Bake, etc) as well as ones from the health food stores, Target, etc - This is by far a much more natural FAST tan for my shockingly white legs.  I purchased it a few times a few years ago in my local Target, but they stopped carrying it (I swear they do that with anything I fall in love with)!  When I first spotted this on Amazon, there was no way I was paying the hefty shipping charge that particular seller was charging, but when I checked a month or so later, I saw this offered via Prime &amp; jumped right on it.  Yeah!  I had to golf for a work event (haven&#x27;t golfed in like 15 years) - and the Lavera came in 1 day before - applied it to my legs after a shower and shave - it works just as amazing as I remember!  Hope Amazon keeps carrying this via Prime as I&#x27;ll be a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a tanning product that was more natural, so after some research I found this one. I was glad to find out that it works just as well as the non-natural kinds and smells less weird too!&lt;br /&gt;Works in one application, especially if you&#x27;re liberal with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this self tanner on my face &amp; body for 4 years. I love that it looks natural not orange, does not streak &amp; the scent is pleasant. Great product!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite self tanning lotion for years.  Fabulous formula. Clean, clean, clean ingredients.  A must have for the transition from winter to spring.  I am hoping one day that they will make an &amp;#34;airbrush&amp;#34; formula so it will be easier to get my back covered. I highly recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Wow! I  bought a number of self tanning creams to compare one against another. This was the best. It doesn&#x27;t look orange and it isn&#x27;t too dark. Put a little on, wait a few hours, then put another layer on. This worked for me for the best results. That&#x27;s because you need to wait a bit to see how dark each layer becomes. I accidentally didn&#x27;t do this the first time got my face TOO dark (although never orange!). I&#x27;m fair skinned, though, so it might be unnecessary to do that for darker skinned people.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed with this self tanner. Applied several times to myself and my son and had very disappointing results. Nothing much more than a moisturizer. I woukd like a full refund.</li>
