      <li>The scent is in my arena of likeable scents and I love that it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
      <li>, It smells ok-</li>
      <li>This is a nice mild scent.</li>
      <li>now I am comfortable going out all day knowing I smell fresh and good.</li>
      <li>I like this as an alternative with a more floral notes but the original remains my favorite.</li>
      <li>ANd The top of this has to be bent to fit it in the cabinet.</li>
      <li>I prefer her original scent much better.</li>
      <li>I love the Selena Gomez original fragrance</li>
      <li>This fragrance is a more floral version of the fruity original by Selena Gomez.  </li>
      <li>My daughter is a huge Selna fan.</li>
      <li>Im excited to use this all summer all</li>
      <li>My granddaughter is the biggest Selena fan and was soooo excited to findally get this from me</li>
      <li>Ordered this perfume as a gift for a teenage girl who loved it.</li>
      <li>I was a little iffy about it because I&#x27;m not a fan of hers, but Oh my goodness does it smell good!</li>
      <li>When the package came, I was pleased to find everything in tact, but not only that, but it was HUGE.</li>
      <li>I love that it is a floral scent that still smells young.</li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure you knew it is a long bottle with a pretty tall top</li>
      <li>The bottle is nice, however, I haev a perfume shelf, and it is several layers.</li>
      <li>It is not overpowering at all, and it is suitable for work or daily wear.  </li>
      <li>Lily and vanilla are the main differences to this fragrance, which shares the original&#x27;s fruity undertones.  </li>
      <li>I like the other one way better!</li>
      <li>The box itself was much larger than I expected, and the bottle is as beautiful as it looks.</li>
      <li>The bottle is not only pretty, it is huge.</li>
      <li>an is quite a large quanity.</li>
      <li>It is also packaged really well.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to any girl, that wants everyone to notice you&#x27;ve walked in.</li>
      <li>IDK, IDK how I feel about it really.</li>
      <li>It smells great as a real perfume, it&#x27;s floral, but not flowery, and at first I thought it smelled like expensive hand soap, but as I continued to wear it, it won me over.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recomend this to anyone who loves a sensual, mildly sweet and lingery perfume.</li>
      <li>Its very bland, I cannot smell anything but a very strong soapy smell.</li>
      <li>Seems like it&#x27;s not brand new</li>
      <li>wear it and get compliments, but, I feel like its my least favorite of my collection.</li>

    <li> Sensual, subtle, inviting is all l can say to describe this perfume. It&#x27;s the type of perfume that one would want to sniff every now and again because it smells so divine.

I can smell it on my clothes and even in my sheets when l go to sleep. Definitely will buy this again!!!</li>

    <li> Perfume smells great n the bottle is beautiful :)</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Very good Quality ,..</li>
    <li> When the package came, I was pleased to find everything in tact, but not only that, but it was HUGE. The box itself was much larger than I expected, and the bottle is as beautiful as it looks. It smells great as a real perfume, it&#x27;s floral, but not flowery, and at first I thought it smelled like expensive hand soap, but as I continued to wear it, it won me over. I like that now I am comfortable going out all day knowing I smell fresh and good. :) Again, very pleased.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is a more floral version of the fruity original by Selena Gomez.  Lily and vanilla are the main differences to this fragrance, which shares the original&#x27;s fruity undertones.  I love that this fragrance is very light!  It is not overpowering at all, and it is suitable for work or daily wear.  I love that it is a floral scent that still smells young.</li>
    <li> I suppose I you like the smell of soap you&#x27;d like this. Its very bland, I cannot smell anything but a very strong soapy smell. Was not aware this order could not be returned. Should not have bought it without smelling it.</li>
    <li> I am giving this a 3 star rating because the quality of the perfume is very good, I am just not a fan of the scent. I prefer her original scent much better.</li>
    <li> The scent is in my arena of likeable scents and I love that it&#x27;s not overpowering. It is a scent for everyday that makes me feel luxurious. The bottle is beautiful and confess its what attracted me to the product.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.  Wonderful</li>
    <li> Probably one of my #1 scent that I have found. Im excited to use this all summer all and I would wanna buy one again!!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you like settle sweet/citruscy scent then this is your fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mild scent.</li>
    <li> I tried this in the store, and LOVED It. And then I got it, and wore it, and I dont like it anymore. The bottle is nice, however, I haev a perfume shelf, and it is several layers. ANd The top of this has to be bent to fit it in the cabinet. And I dont like that, but thats not why I dont lilke the product. I wanted to make sure you knew it is a long bottle with a pretty tall top/cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it and get compliments, but, I feel like its my least favorite of my collection. I use it, to get rid of it. Its very strong smell, It smells ok- I guess. IDK, IDK how I feel about it really. I have a love/hate relationship with it, I suppose. :)</li>
    <li> Long-lasting, smells great, and a pretty bottle! I love it!</li>
