### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent.</li>
      <li>I find the scent wonderful and relaxing.</li>
      <li>This was wonderful as an aftershave and body lotion when Pinaud was still in business.</li>
      <li>Wonderful fragrance and feel for an aftershave splash but still has the pinuad core</li>
      <li>Perhaps they should start scenting urinal cakes with a lemon scent instead of lilac, and then this wonderful Lilac Vegetal would stop being compared to urinal cakes.  </li>
      <li>I hope they never stop making Lilac Vegetal because it is a wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>Excellent spring fragrance.</li>
      <li>This is the best aftershave ever.</li>

      <li>Another Great Product Clubman Pinaud.</li>
      <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love the smell of lilacs in the springtime!?!?  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s remarkable.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it smells nothing like a 50/50 mix of Patchouli and PINE-SOL, as do most products on the market today.</li>
      <li>Great smell, not offensive, good for a body splash after shower.</li>
      <li>You smelled great and the gals loved it.</li>
      <li>and now you must have the most wonderful flashbacks when you walk into the Men&#x27;s Room at a Megaplex or a Cinemark.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>Good product at a GREAT price.</li>
      <li>Suffice to say I&#x27;m in line with the descriptions from others that don&#x27;t find it pleasant.  </li>
      <li>It is pleasant, cooling and it does the job.</li>
      <li>Light scented and wonderful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although I would have loved to give this product a good review, I just don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
      <li>My dad smelled good when he wore either one,  He smelled like my dad.</li>
      <li>Good price..</li>
      <li>Its actually a good combination.</li>
      <li>It also has good staying power.</li>
      <li>It looked like it would smell good because the bottle and liquid color looked good.</li>
      <li>In a GOOD way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I decided to give it a fair trial and slapped it on after shaving.  </li>
      <li>You will smell good and it is inexpensive.</li>
      <li>I always loved the scent of lilacs, and the invigorating feeling on my skin.  </li>
      <li>This product is as good as sliced bread.</li>
      <li>It does make my skin feel great after shaving, it&#x27;s also nice to put a bit on a kleenex to wipe the day&#x27;s grime off your face.  </li>
      <li>and I was smelling good in 4 days with no hassle that to me</li>
      <li>Excellent, the hard-to-find original from 1980s</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re the type of person that might think it would be awesome to smell like Play-doh, you are absolutely right!</li>
      <li>stars because my package didn&#x27;t arrive by drone.ht think it would be awesome to smell like Play-doh, you are absolutely right!</li>
      <li>I have been thrilled to find the Pinaud line, good smelling after shaves at a really good price.  </li>
      <li>Then again, to each his own, whatever works for you is good.</li>
      <li>I have worn this twice to the office and both times got many compliments!  </li>
      <li>more a chemical smell that someone tried to cover with soap than a pleasant after shave.  </li>
      <li>They were both unique and beautiful in their own ways.  </li>
      <li>i  think this is an amazing product that my family has used for over 85 years since my father invented it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hers was quite nice, too.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;ve got my own.  </li>
      <li>May take some getting used to if you do not use a floral aftershave of any kind like it did for me</li>
      <li>To those who claim this stuff smells like a urinal, urinal cake (It kind of does in the bottle BUT not on the skin), funeral home</li>
      <li>For those who like the scent, remember this, you may appreciate the scent, but the chances are quite good that someone in your company will think that you smell like the urinal at their favorite bar.</li>
      <li>and i am just trying to be honest.</li>
      <li>Now, aside from the whiz, of course, I liked the smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to make sweeping pronouncements that attempt to nullify every opinion but those which align with my own.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and it went onto my wishlist at once.</li>
      <li>I own all of the Clubman Pinaud line of aftershaves and colognes.  </li>
      <li>Not over powering, but a nice manly scent.  </li>
      <li>To each his own.</li>
      <li>Kind of like a walk through a vegetable garden.</li>
      <li>I did not tell her what I thought because I wanted an honest opinion.</li>
      <li>I wear it three times a week and get compliments on its warm but peculiar aroma.</li>
      <li>To each his own, but the Clubman Pinaud Lilac Vegetal is not for me.  </li>
      <li>But hey each to their own.</li>
      <li>I kind of like that in an aftershave.  </li>
      <li>A great manly scent for an aftershave, originally made for Napoleons Hungarian Cavalry.</li>
      <li>I have found that many of the ideas and practices of our Fathers &amp; Grandfathers are valid and superior to many of the ideas of today.</li>
      <li>However, the scent is VERY strong when you splash it on.  </li>
      <li>I could not decide which bottle I liked better.  </li>
      <li>This wonderful stuff is timeless and masculine...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Another great product from Pinaud. My long time favorite</li>
    <li> This scent is not for everybody. It&#x27;s a strong, complex and sweet scent that manages to be decidedly masculine despite being floral. You&#x27;d have to try it to know if you&#x27;ll like it, but it&#x27;s important to know that it smells different on your skin than it does out of the bottle. For me, pretty significantly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the polarizing scent, it is also a soothing, cooling aftershave that leaves my skin feeling comfortable and healthy. I recommend it, if you don&#x27;t hate the smell. Some people do.</li>
    <li> Good melling, face feels freash and clean long after application.</li>
    <li> I like it because it is not overpowering,feels great when applied,  has a nice scent and is reasonably priced for the quality you get.</li>
    <li> This lightly scented after shave is getting harder to find at the local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly and arrived on time. Great product for those who like a body splash that is not heavy.</li>
    <li> I was at my barber&#x27;s shop this morning for a hair cut and I told him I bought Lilac Vegetal but it smells stronger and different than years ago.  He gave me a GREAT tip &amp; it works!&lt;br /&gt;Get two 12 oz. bottles (I used 2 empty plastic bottles from rubbing alcohol and washed them well); divide the Lilac into 6 oz. in each bottle; add 6 oz. water to each bottle; and 1/2 teaspoon of wintergreen rubbing alcohol into each bottle.  Shake well.  It will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;A great recipe; and now it smells fantastic and you end up with double your product.</li>
    <li> Oh, how I wanted to believe.....I really wanted to LOVE this...Sadly, \\&quot;love\\&quot; is not the word I&#x27;d use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing about this Clubman formula; it is definitely different than anything you&#x27;ve ever smelled or used before &amp; due to its age (being produced since the mid 1800&#x27;s ) one would think that it must have something going for it otherwise production would have been halted long ago..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One piece of advice that I followed was NOT to smell it directly out of the bottle because it smells strongly of urine and sweet flowers. I decided to wait until after my nice straight razor shave and go into the thing full force, after all it will fade away even if it would up being horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment of truth arrived and I splashed the green mixture upon my face, neck, and shoulders. Gave it a few moments to air dry and then...............The aroma is very hard to describe.  Is definitely IS lilac however; there is something else that smells of an antediluvian mystery...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do not HATE this peculiar aftershave (although my good lady does) I won&#x27;t put it in regular rotation because for me, it is something special I will save for a late afternoon shave when I can ponder just what the hell is in it...Again, this makes me sad because I&#x27;ve heard such great things about Lilac Vegetal and I so wanted to love it. Alas, all I can say is that it is: \\&quot;Interesting\\&quot; and the jury is still out to see if it grows on me....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many aftershaves and found this one lacking. It has an aroma of cold medicine and flowers. The bottle was tossed after first use. This is a personal opinion of course and Clubman Pinaud makes many good products.</li>
    <li> I ordered this BEFORE reading the reviews, and having received it today I can agree with the whole \\&quot;urinal cake\\&quot; description.  This stuff STINKS....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does smell like a truck stop bathroom.  It&#x27;s not bad if you are into that, but I gave it away within minutes of having first tried it.  I even poured some out and let it sit/breathe as somebody had suggested.  That DID help, but it still was offensive.</li>
    <li> Works as it should as an aftershave, but I don&#x27;t care for the scent. It is not offensive, just not my &#x27;style&#x27;. It has an aroma reminiscent of Johnson&#x27;s baby powder, very mild, and, as I said, not offensive. I will stick with the original scent from now on.</li>
    <li> Not for everyone, but not only do I like it but so does SWMBO.</li>
    <li> Good aftershave with long lasting fragrance. It is also soothing to the skin when applied. Reminds me of the barber shop days of long ago.</li>
    <li> I found this product when I was in the service stationed in Orleans, France.  I have been using it ever since 1963 when I can find it.  You could find it in the stores once upon a time but now I finally found it at Amazon.  Please keep it on the market if I am the only one using it.  You can&#x27;t imagine what this product does for your skin after shaving!!  Smooth, easy on and no rough edges!  Thanks for stocking it.</li>
    <li> It seemed a little off to me, but I was certain it was fake when I realized the word Cooling was spelled incorrectly on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Pay no mind to the negative reviews. Actually, pay no mind to the positive reviews either. One does not simply choose The Veg. The Veg chooses you. And it is an honor to be chosen by The Veg. Buy it now and see for yourself if you are a Knight of the Veg Table, so that you may join us in pitying those who are not chosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this stuff is great. It smells good in the bottle, but it smells even better when it mellows out into a nice, complex floral scent. Excellent spring fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. Hard to find. Love it.</li>
    <li> I am dying of laughter reading these reviews. I did a search for reviews to see if I was crazy thinking this stuff smelled like piss.  Apparently I&#x27;m not crazy. I really want to like the smell of this because I love regular clubman. I picked this up while looking for Bay Rum. All the store had was this. I put this on a couple days ago just for a test run and didn&#x27;t care for it much. I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on it but a familiar foul smell kept wafting past my nose. Fast forward a couple days.. I just finished shaving and put it on to give it another chance. My daughter chased me out of her room in disgust. Then it hit me! It smells like a convalescent home! I then went to my wife for the sniff test. I did not tell her what I thought because I wanted an honest opinion. She said I smelled like an old lady. Bingo! Old ladies and piss! Just like a convalescent home.&lt;br /&gt;  I am glad that some people seem to like this fragrance. It does not work for me. Maybe it&#x27;s just that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different and this smells wonderful on some people. On me it smells like old ladies and piss. Just like a convalescent home. Not sure what I&#x27;ll do with the rest of the bottle. Maybe I&#x27;ll give 8t another try later, maybe I&#x27;ll give it away. Too bad...</li>
    <li> Has a nice light floral scent, reminiscent of old time barber shops.Fragrance is personal, but I find this pleasant and not overpowering or overly sweet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 35 years and it never fails to meet expectations.</li>
    <li> Smells just like I remember it, reminds me of an old barber shop. Has a very distinct vegetal odor, with a hint of lilac. Kind of like a walk through a vegetable garden.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks. Smells like a urinal stall at a ballpark.</li>
    <li> Nice light refreshing scent, classic Clubman. Use it as a body cologne, it&#x27;s not overpowering but has a lasting and memorable scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the standard Clubman Pinaud for several years, but it was always just a bit too strong, and a bit too common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lilac Vegetal version is both slightly milder, and a bit more distinctive.  My wife likes it just fine, and I&#x27;m more confident that the fragrance isn&#x27;t offensive. I shave with an old-fashioned safety razor, and use a liberal amount of after-shave each morning, so the gentler scent is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who may be worried, not the scent isn&#x27;t overly floral.  You won&#x27;t smell like a walking lilac patch afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully intend for this to be my standard after-shave going forward and will stock extra bottles in the cupboard.</li>
    <li> Severe aroma therapy. Takes me all the way back to my neighborhood barber in my high school days.</li>
    <li> Pinaud Lilac Vegetal is a wonderful aftershave,it has an old-timey barber shop scent to it that seperates it from the rest of the pack in the scent market.As for myself I highly enjoy it,it has a lovely lilac scent but for some they may find the smell repulsive..why?well Lilac has been a popular scent in the institutional chemical industry for years-it&#x27;s used in urinal cakes,you smell it strongly in nursing homes and Pinaud Lilac Vegetal used to be highly used on cadavers to cover up the smell of embalming fluids releasing from the pores.Besides that,if you like the smell of lilacs...by all means give it a try.But if you think when you put this on your&#x27;e at someone&#x27;s funeral..pass it on to someone who appreciates it&#x27;s classy scent:)</li>
    <li> Lot&#x27;s of people love this; but to me it smelled like old people at a funeral parlor.  I re-gifted it.</li>
    <li> I have an older bottle thats about 15-20 years old. Still has some content but running out so I ordered some more. Opened one of the unbroken bottles I recieved and the smell is off and different then what I have. Looked at ingriedients and this new formula has two different ingrediants then the old bottle. Smell has a subtle rank smell.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product because it has a rancid odor that you can&#x27;t get rid of and you can&#x27;t return the item because it is considered (Hazardous Waste)...\\&quot;No pun intended\\&quot; UPDATE FOR RANCID--So as to not make it a total waste, instead of using it on yourself just use it as a toilet bowl cleaner, that is what I am using it for.</li>
    <li> Just received it, opened it and poured it down the toilet. It smells that bad! There is a pungent and very offensive odor in this bottle and a urinal cake is perfumy compare to this aftershave.</li>
    <li> Curious fragrance. Really curious. Feels great on the face after a shave not too much alcohol to burn you.</li>
    <li> It was great to find one of my old favorites Clubman Pinaud Lilac Vegetal.  I am a man who only goes to a real barber shop and avoid \\&quot;hair stylists\\&quot; like the plague. In all my 63 years I went to a hair stylist once, the day before I got married 40+ years ago and will never do that again! I used this product years ago and thought it had vanished but low and below I stumbled on this item and ordered it.  As soon as I recieved the package I open the bottle and boy it was just as I remembered! I have worn this twice to the office and both times got many compliments!  Also told my barber about it and he is looking to order some as he thought this product was no more. Good old barber shop scent!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the trick. before you start shaving, pour some into a container and let it air while you are shaving. Then after you are finished shaving, clean up and then take the after shave that you pour and use that. My grandfather was a barber and he always let his customer&#x27;s favorite after shave \\&quot;air out\\&quot; before using it. He never used it straight out of the bottle because it would be too strong. Gentlemen, try using it this way, and I guarantee you will love this sense. LET IT AIR OUT AND USE 1/2 OF WHAT YOU WANT TO USE. That&#x27;s the secret.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Ok, not one of my favorites. Light on the fragrance and it&#x27;s good for a change to only go back to my other spicer ones.</li>
    <li> used in past , light refreshing sent aafter shave body splash</li>
    <li> This was wonderful as an aftershave and body lotion when Pinaud was still in business. But since Clubman started making the stuff it&#x27;s terrible and bares little resemblance to the original. It needs more lilac smell and it&#x27;s oily/greasy. My God it&#x27;s oily. It&#x27;s not the light, refreshing product Pinaud put out. RIP Lilac Vegtal After Shave.</li>
    <li> Like most Pinaud aftershave products, the Lilac Vegetal had a very familiar scent.  Unfortunately, it did not measure up to other Pinaud products I have been using.  The &amp;#34;familiar scent&amp;#34; was immediately recognized as &amp;#34;urinal cake&amp;#34;...used urinal cake, at that.  To each his own, but the Clubman Pinaud Lilac Vegetal is not for me.  I&#x27;m a huge and loyal fan of other Pinaud products...just not this one.</li>
    <li> Smells like public urinals. Splashed my face, then immediately flushed the rest down the toilet where it belongs.</li>
    <li> I started using Clubman products a few years back.I was wanting that&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;old time\\&quot; barbershop feel.Clubman does not disappoint in that respect.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect some \\&quot;NEW,Modern,Heavy\\&quot; fragrance...just old school manly&lt;br /&gt;scents(Great after a wet shave experience) Vegetal Lilac,you will either&lt;br /&gt;LOVE it or HATE it!!.It might take alittle time getting used to the&lt;br /&gt;fragrance,it becomes very subtle after it dries off. Splash it on&lt;br /&gt;after a shave or touch-up during the day.</li>
    <li> Pinaud Clubman Lilac Vegetal After Shave Lotion has a pleasing floral yet masculine scent and is soothing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Like other Pinaud products, it&#x27;s like a trip to an old-time barber shop.</li>
    <li> Really happy to see this product for sale on Amazon. I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. Great, masculine fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have used Lilac Vegetal for about 40 years since I was in college and say their ad in Playboy, so I&#x27;m not new to the rodeo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the latest product seems to be a new formula with mych less \\&quot;lilac\\&quot; and more of a \\&quot;paint thinner\\&quot; fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am a female who grew up with a father who alternated this aftershave with the original Old Spice.  The 2 bottles were side by side in his medicine cabinet.  I remember opening the cabinet, kind of secretly, as a child.  I could not decide which bottle I liked better.  They were both unique and beautiful in their own ways.  I do remember watching my dad slap them both on his cheeks and neck after he shaved with his brush, soap and razor.  It was a ritual I enjoyed watching.  My dad smelled good when he wore either one,  He smelled like my dad. I bought it for a memory that scent revives.  Scent is so good at that!  When I open the bottle, I see my dad standing at the sink and me sitting on the vanity.  It is a breath of fresh air, old fashioned but timeless.  It&#x27;s my dad</li>
    <li> This is one that people are very divided on. It doesn&#x27;t start out very good. It reminds me a little of the urine cake in a men&#x27;s urinal. HOWEVER, if you give it a minute or two, it has a nice floral smell that is good for Spring when things are in bloom and smells like lilacs or a little like night jasmine and also powdery.It also has good staying power. I recommend it as a body splash rather than just an after shave.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this stuff, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all, not even in small quantities.  I was drawn to it because it claims a subtle lilac smell, which is fairly unique in men&#x27;s grooming and hygiene products.  I love lilac.  This smells less like lilac and exactly like the wipes my wife uses to clean out our hedgehog&#x27;s cage, Nature&#x27;s Miracle Deodorizing Cage Wipes (http://www.amazon.com/NMIR-ANI-CAGE-WIPES-35COUNT/dp/B0010OQGH6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_cc_1?s&#x3D;aps&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1333322065&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1-catcorr).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very runny, just completely watery, no thickness to it at all.  That&#x27;s fine, I suppose, but when I hear the word \\&quot;vegetal\\&quot; I think of something more substantial than this.  It&#x27;s probably better than most of the goop on the shelves today, but it stinks.  I recommend this instead: Nivea For Men Revitalizing Balm (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FPZAFC/ref&#x3D;oh_o05_s00_i00_details); sometimes modern products really are improvements over the old timey ones.</li>
    <li> Great product smells great can&#x27;t say enough good things about it my dad used it BUT the vender justotc left me in the dark for 25 days after I e-mailed them a bunch of times with no response Ithought I got ripped off so I got it from another web site and I was smelling good in 4 days with no hassle that to me says a lot</li>
    <li> This is an extremely masculine scent, although it isn&#x27;t as strong as it used to be. It&#x27;s an extremely clean scent I remember my father and grandfather wearing.</li>
    <li> My Dad had this stuff!  I got an old bottle of it with some left over. This stuff is great!  Don&#x27;t let the word lilac fool you. This is not flowery. It us fresh and clean and unique. So glad they are still&lt;br /&gt;Making this.</li>
    <li> For all of you urinal fanatics I don&#x27;t think it smells like that at all. The aroma isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it isn&#x27;t my worst.  As an aftershave it cools and tons my skin, leaving it shiny after it dries.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I must agree with those that write that this product smells like urinal cakes. Immediately after removing the cap from the bottle, the aroma of a men&#x27;s bathroom filled my nose. For those who like the scent, remember this, you may appreciate the scent, but the chances are quite good that someone in your company will think that you smell like the urinal at their favorite bar. Why take that chance when there are other products?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed at the positive reviews for this stuff. Due to its legendary status on a wet shaving board I frequent, I picked up some Lilac Vegetal over the weekend and tried it out for myself. It&#x27;s definitely a love it or hate it fragrance. And I...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...HATE IT! Does it smell like lilac? Sure, if the lilac you&#x27;re looking for is a lilac disinfectant cake covered in stale urine. You think I&#x27;m kidding? IT SMELLS LIKE STALE URINE. No really... it smells like an unkept public urinal. Well, that&#x27;s how it smells in, and right out of, the bottle. After an hour or two on the skin, the urine scent finally gives way to a soft, flowery fragrance. But even that fragrance isn&#x27;t pleasant, and you won&#x27;t be able to wash it off fast enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why HUMAN MEN would want to smell like this. Maybe men in 1840 wanted to smell like this. However, it&#x27;s not 1840 anymore. Even though I love the other classic Pinaud fragrances, this one should&#x27;ve stayed buried in the past.</li>
    <li> I am a wet shaver,double edged razor blades,shaving mug and brush. I have found that many of the ideas and practices of our Fathers &amp; Grandfathers are valid and superior to many of the ideas of today. Since I disovered this goes back a long time,I decided to try it...Forget it. This smells exactly like some small stores,here in Florida with either a mildew problem or some other air quality problem and they send this smell through the air conditioning system they use. It is not a pleasant smell and as another reviewer pointed out,there is a faint smell of urine( please dont ask what kind,Im not a urologist.)If you decide to buy this, I strongly recommend you do not wear this with anyone you care about.If you are interested in old time after shaves, I would recommend witch hazel or Gabels Bay Rum( which does not retain its aroma for a long period of time which makes it ideal for work).If you want a longer lasting aroma,try Royall Bay Rum.I received this Lilac today in the mail &amp; it is going in the garbage today. Im out $8.00 plus shipping but live &amp; learn.Should have rated this no stars</li>
    <li> To start off with, I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s and started wet shaving 4 years ago.  I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Clubman aftershaves; namely the classic version and bay rum.  I popped on this purchase after reading several good reviews here at amazon and ignoring the negative ones which spoke of a \\&quot;urinal\\&quot; type smell.  After recieving the product, I have 2 comments.  1, it performs as an aftershave should, soothes the skin much like the other clubman products.  2, the product does have a very distinct smell, which I would agree with previous posters and describe it as a \\&quot;urinal\\&quot; smell.  Other posters describe this as an \\&quot;old time barbershop scent\\&quot;.  Being that barbershops came about long before urinals, we may be looking at this all backwards.  The urinal cake manufactureres may have purposely scented their product as barbershop aftershave to add a familiar and well recieved scent to the mens room.  So now we have an interesting factor.... does the aftershave smell like the mensroom?  or does the mensroom smell like the aftershave?  In either case, I think this scent is past its prime.  In the future I&#x27;ll stick with fragrances which havent been pawned off to janitorial supply companies.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not for everyone. You either love it or hate it. Takes a bit to get used to and I do only wear it when I&#x27;m feeling frisky, but it&#x27;s good stuff. If you buy it, it&#x27;s better to decant it into a glass bottle. Not sure what it does, but it makes it better after being in glass for a bit</li>
    <li> Rancid.  I remember using this stuff in high school.....it came in a real glass, not plastic, bottle back then.  Smelled great.  Then I couldn&#x27;t find it for decades but noticed it recently on Amazon and bought it.  I was excited when it arrived.  I opened the plastic bottle and took one whiff of it and thought I was going to pass out.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Either my olfactory glands have changed over the years or this was a bad batch.  I decided to give it a fair trial and slapped it on after shaving.  I almost puked.  Fortunately, my private office has a door so I did not infect the entire office complex.  To get a second opinion I gave my friend the whole bottle without mentioning my take on it.  The next day he told me that he flushed it down the toilet.  I was thinking about waiting a while and buying a bottle from a second batch.  But with all of these one star reviews they must have changed the formula.  The other Clubman products are great.  I&#x27;m baffled and I&#x27;ll never know what happened but I guess worse things have happened..</li>
    <li> I should have payed more attention to the negative reviews of this product.  It STINKS.  you get the same smell rubbing soap on your face.  The bottle is pretty though.  This is not what I remember that barbers used in the 50s and 60s..  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Have to admit, I agree somewhat with the person who glossed this as smelling like a urinal puck. Trying to get used to it. Also, if you aren&#x27;t quite awake when you&#x27;re done shaving, slapping this on yoyr face will certainly bring you into consciousness with maximum dispatch. Hoping it grows on me (figuratively)</li>
    <li> I found this in Germany in 1981. It&#x27;s a difficult scent to describe; my wife says that it&#x27;s a reminder of a summer&#x27;s day. To me, it&#x27;s simply clean.I had the not unpleasant experience of getting on an elevator in Chicago, followed by a lovely young woman and a fit young man,whom looked as if he were designed by aliens to be the woman&#x27;s partner in a sit-com. The young man was reeking with some cologne or other that I&#x27;m certain was coloured blue and had a single word name, which - translated -- means &#x27;Reeks&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young lady actually edged towards the fat, ugly, middle aged man until the young man decamped on the thirtieth floor, taking a nearly visible cloud of stink with him. The lovely sniffed -- genteelly, naturally -- and commented how nice my scent was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hers was quite nice, too. Although I&#x27;m reasonably certain that she wasn&#x27;t wearing Clubman Pinaud Lilac Vegetal, as I was.</li>
    <li> Makes a man smell like a little old lady. The way little old ladies smelled back in the 1970&#x27;s Nasty stuff! Has the aroma of urine on the floor and flowers. Yuck!</li>
    <li> I bought this without ever smelling it. Yes, I read the reviews of the folks saying it smells like a urinal, my opinion is it doesn&#x27;t resemble a urinal cake or urine at all. My girlfriend agrees and loves the smell of this too. It has a strong, fresh smell right after you splash it on and then an hour afterwards it mellows to a faint floral scent. Even though it&#x27;s strong right out of the bottle, it&#x27;s not cloying. It&#x27;s remarkable. I love it. It tones the skin well after a 3-pass shave with a safety razor/DE.</li>
    <li> Same here.  Have an old bottle ....glass when that was what it came in.  Now it smells fake comparing the old stuff&lt;br /&gt;to this cheap chemical junk.  But hey each to their own.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been so long, I&#x27;m not sure this reality will ever live up to my memory.  The fragrance seems to be a bit subdued to what I remember, but it&#x27;s pretty good.  It does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this from my youth through my 40&#x27;s.  Then, it disappeared from the shelves.  Now, some decades later, I see it&#x27;s CLUBMAN PINAUD... when I last remembered it, it was on PINAUD...</li>
    <li> This to me has a more citrus like smell than the original but has its merits. The primary smell I detect is linalool. Linalool is a naturally occurring alcohol found in many flowers and spices with many applications, the majority of which are based on its floral scent with a touch of spiciness. Yes, this is more subtle than the original formula, but also quite nice. I only wish this came in a glass bottle instead of plastic.</li>
    <li> this s*** stinks. Like well s***.., not for me maybe an old whore. $ 5.00 whore</li>
    <li> Excellent. Seems consistent with the Lilac Vegetal I have been using for years.  Taste may not be everyone&#x27;s, but I like it. Not to heavy or cloying. Sooths the skin after shaving.</li>
    <li> Everything is AOK. Clubman Pinaud Lilac Vegetal After Shave Lotion, 12 Ounce arrived on time. I am pleased, I will reccommend this to anyone. I will do business with this company again. Thanks for your great service.</li>
    <li> This cologne smelled terrible. Maybe this is because I did not choose the right one, but this lotion is very pungent and not so flowery. Way too much musk</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GCSCSE Pinaud Clubman Lilac Vegetal After Shave Lotion - 12 Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems it is hard to find but it is easy on your face with a nice lilac fregrance.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I am hesitant to wear this every day, but for more formal, fancier occassions, I would not hesitate to wear this aftershave with my favorite cologne.  At first, this splash is kind of overwhelming, at least for me.  After about five seconds it diminishes to its base notes, which are mainly lilac and fresh garden vegetation.  This scent lasts for a good 3 hours after splashing it on and you will be reminded of it from time to time throughout the day, as will those near you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way I can describe this scent is that it&#x27;s \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; or \\&quot;sophisticated\\&quot;.  You won&#x27;t ever get the reaction \\&quot;ew, what is that smell\\&quot; but you will get \\&quot;wow, what is that you&#x27;re wearing\\&quot; type inquiries from women, at least in my experience :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can always dilute this with another aftershave product such as a lotion or another, thicker aftershave, which is common amongst wetshavers.  When I do this, I prefer to use this lilac vegetal, give it a few minutes to absorb, and then use a Proraso crema aftershave, or a Proraso Dioibarba (menthol) aftershave.  Either of those will subdue the fragrance but allow it to still come through more subtly.  Apply your daily cologne and go on your way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this product as a pure aftershave, it seems to be a bit more harsh for me, but I have very-super-sensitive neck skin.  My facial skin is in love with this, and basically all aftershaves, but my neck does not like it as much, unless I use a second, more lotion-y type aftershave afterwards.  For that, I stick with Lubriderm Men&#x27;s 3-in-1 lotion.  Using both, I get the scent I love (lilac) and the soothing I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 5 of 5 stars.  I will subscribe and save again when I am nearing the end of my current supply :)</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, unable to find it around here, been using it for 30 years</li>
    <li> My wife hates the smell, but I think it&#x27;s very masculine. Definitely a barber-shop scent and I would much prefer this brand over any other Alcohol-based after shaves. I&#x27;ve tried all three Pinaud scents, the lime (original), this Lilac, and the vanilla. I think the vanilla is the most pleasing and easiest to wear daily. These all tend to last a while, just be careful no to put on too much. I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend these for daily use because of the alcohol content or if you have very sensitive skin. The absolute best shaving lotion on the market is made by Truefitt and Hill, you will be amazed, but it is far from cheap like this stuff. Good shaving!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like Lilacs; in fact, doesn&#x27;t smell like any vegetation...well, hold on...it sort of smells like rancid grass clippings at first. But wait...(this is where patience needs to kick in) because something magical happens during the dry down. What emerges is a light, crisp scent that&#x27;s quite pleasant. Where this product really shines, though, is long after your shave. This stuff is first aid for the face; it makes your face feel soft and smooth all day. Just keep your face a bit wet when you apply it, and I also strongly recommend airing the lotion in a small Dixie cup while you shave. How much? Maybe 2-3 shakes of the bottle. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Have heard and read lots about the VEG.  So I finally decided to purchase a bottle and see for myself.  First, the scent out of the bottle is pleasing (despite what you have read).  However, the scent is VERY strong when you splash it on.  A little goes a long way.  After it settles down, the scent is solid and smells like flowers.</li>
    <li> This aftershave is AWESOME! Don&#x27;t let all the \\&quot;Negative Nancys\\&quot; out there who complain about it smelling like urea, urinal cakes, or urine dissuade you. Those people are just sheep who are too comfortable with their cookie-cutter scents. Panaud Lilac Vegetal is truly a one-of-a-kind scent that apparently only \\&quot;real men\\&quot; can appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me start by saying that I&#x27;m a big fan of Clubman Pinaud products. I&#x27;ve always been fond of the original scent, and have recently fallen in love with the Special Reserve. My medicine cabinet is well stocked with Clubman Pinaud aftershaves, including their Bay Rum, Lime Sec and Osage Rub. And those are all fine scents. People like them. Read the reviews and you&#x27;ll see that they are pretty universally well received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, maybe you&#x27;re not like everyone else. Maybe you like to think of yourself as a beautiful little snowflake that is one of a kind and unlike all of the other snowflakes. Maybe smelling \\&quot;nice\\&quot; is too boring for you. Maybe you live on the edge and you need a scent that tells others that you will not be ignored. If this describes you, then Pinaud has the scent for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been really looking forward to trying the Veg - the fact that so many people seem to hate it, and use really awful words to describe it, intrigued me. So, I took the plunge (toilet joke not intended) and I ordered myself a bottle of Pinaud Lilac Vegetal. It arrived by mail (I was hoping it would come by drone, but no dice) and yesterday morning I splashed some on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to gravitate towards old school, classic scents when it comes to aftershaves. That has caused my wife, on more than a few occasions, to tell me that I smell like an old man. Well, as soon as I splashed the Veg on I had to agree- it def has an old person scent- and not necessarily an old man smell. After a few hours the \\&quot;basenote\\&quot; started coming through, and I began to smell like... Play-Doh. If you&#x27;re the type of person that might think it would be awesome to smell like Play-doh, you are absolutely right! The scent was so incredible that after a few hours, it actually started to make me a bit nauseous. That might seem like a bad thing, but not for a real man like me- I need a scent that&#x27;s going to come right up and punch me in the gut a few times, just so I know I am alive and can still smell. And the best thing about it? The scent really sticks around! More than 14 hours after the initial application, my head ached and I still caught whiffs of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so powerful that the next morning- even after my shower- the smell of Play-Doh still lingered. I would have reapplied more of The Veg, but I was taking my kids to Chuck E. Cheeses and I was afraid I would be trampled to death by children looking for Play-Doh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because my package didn&#x27;t arrive by drone.ht think it would be awesome to smell like Play-doh, you are absolutely right!

    <li> With all due apologies to the fan boys here, I must offer a frank review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put my taste in context, I&#x27;m a 30-something professional man. I work in an office, wear business casual and sometimes business formal. I&#x27;m a somewhat experienced fragrance collector; my fragrance wardrobe numbers well over 300 by now, ranging from dollar store knock-offs to numerous Montale, Amouage, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, Le Labo, and so on. I like anything that smells really nice, really enjoyable, regardless of how much it costs. Some of my top 10 most enjoyable fragrances are pretty cheap synthetics, particularly Fujiyama and Issey Miyake fragrances, simply sublime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was purchased as an experiment, &#x27;buy blind&#x27;, because it was cheap and \\&quot;lilac vegetal\\&quot; sounds like it might be interesting if it&#x27;s done competently. Unfortunately, there is already a name, which every gentleman will know and know well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;URINAL CAKES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a dead ringer, absolutely indistinguishable from those little pink cakes you find melting away when you... well, no need to go further. I&#x27;m sorry to say it, as I bought 12oz of it and I generally make an effort to use up every fragrance I buy even if it&#x27;s not my favorite. I have not, to date, found one so objectionable that I would discard it. Unfortunately, I may not even find this worthy of being a toilet bowl freshener, as I do not want the toilets in my home to smell like a gas station urinal. It&#x27;s just such a familiar scent... I suppose I&#x27;m apologetic because so many folks will rate my review \\&quot;not helpful\\&quot; simply because I don&#x27;t like it, or because of the negative connotation of urinal cakes, but all I&#x27;m saying is that I do not enjoy the smell of urinal cakes on my face after I shave. It&#x27;s an honest assessment of a tremendously familiar and unmistakable scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether that&#x27;s something you want on your face is up to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An update: it is very good as an astringent. Meaning, as an aftershave, it actually does work. It smells like urinal cakes,  but when I give myself a clean shave on the weekends and don&#x27;t need to be around anyone but myself, I apply this stuff just to use it. It actually really does work to smooth over a rough shave and stop itching. Better than just about anything else I&#x27;ve tried, including all the designer fragrances. So it works for its chemical purpose, but it smells like urinal cakes. Try one of the other Pinaud fragrances if you want something that works really wonderfully as an aftershave and doesn&#x27;t make your face smell like something the janitorial staff just dropped into your urinal at work or the airport.ave, it actually does work.

    <li> The bottle busted in shipping.  The shipping paper smelled fantastic though which made me envious.</li>
    <li> It smells exactly like lilacs. But it also can smell like the air freshener inside of a public bathroom. Its a great scent in little quantities but be extremely careful. If you put too much you&#x27;ll end up smelling like a combo of cat per and bathroom air freshener</li>
    <li> My wife hates this.. Smells like urinal cakes... Not sure how she knows what urinal cakes smell like but, I digress.  This stuff is pretty pungent out of the bottle... Smells like old cat lady dead in rocking chair... Hour later I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad at all... Wife disagrees.</li>
    <li> Contrary to all the negative feedback saying Lilac Vegetal smells like &amp;#34;urinal cakes,&amp;#34; they&#x27;re all wet.  Perhaps the scent used in urinal cakes is floral (lilac), so it would be more accurate to state that urinal cakes smell like Lilac Vegetal.  I find the scent of Lilac Vegetal very refreshing and heavy on the lilac scent.  It does, in fact, last all day.  It is an invigorating after shave splash/cologne, of which I receive many compliments.  It smells very &amp;#34;French&amp;#34; in that it has a classic tonic smell that I would imagine in the hair salons from the 30s and 40s.  I hope they never stop making Lilac Vegetal because it is a wonderful product.  Who doesn&#x27;t love the smell of lilacs in the springtime!?!?  A+++++!!!  Tip:  If you want even more lilac presence, may I suggest placing a few extra drops of lilac extract (available online) in the bottle.  Perhaps they should start scenting urinal cakes with a lemon scent instead of lilac, and then this wonderful Lilac Vegetal would stop being compared to urinal cakes.  Again, this DOES NOT smell like urinal cakes--lilac-scented urinal cakes smell like LILAC VEGETAL!!!</li>
    <li> There will be those who will try to convince you that it does not smell like a urinal cake, but I am here to tell you it does.  Yes, I shook the bottle before using it.  Yes, I gave it time to dry on my face so it could assume whatever it&#x27;s final scent would be.  It starts off smelling like a urinal cake and it doesn&#x27;t get better until you wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some of the rather humorous reviews and those people will try to shame you into thinking that you must wear this in order to be a man.  You will be a man that smells like a urinal cake.&lt;br /&gt;Others have fond memories of having tried this the first time, while in France, when they were just getting out of the service.  God bless you for your service.  The French are incredibly grateful for you Dough-Boys and GI&#x27;s and rightfully so.  I have nothing but respect for you but I must say that you developed a love for this scent before it became synonymous for urinal cake and now you must have the most wonderful flashbacks when you walk into the Men&#x27;s Room at a Megaplex or a Cinemark.&lt;br /&gt;One more time: urinal cake.&lt;br /&gt;God bless America.  God bless our service men and women.  Do not buy this product (urinal cake!)</li>
    <li> Smells just like the toilet disk</li>
    <li> This hard to find item is something that has to be ordered so why not use it as a filler to your Amazon Order?  Old men like this as it was the barber shop special lotion that made going to the barber different than a home shave.</li>
    <li> I forgot how awful this was at the barbershop. Now I&#x27;m stuck with a whole bottle.</li>
    <li> This smells worse than urinal cakes. At least they have a refreshing smell. This stinks like sewer water. It reminds me of old people wearing multiple layers of perfume. I guess this is what the ancient Greeks used in response to showering only once a year  The odor gets increasingly worse throughout the day. Its enough to make you sick. I actually had to shower to rid myself of the putrid &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years, and everyone still asks me what it is. Not over powering, but a nice manly scent.  Not perfumey like a lot of others on the market.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, I wear it at least once a week. Reminds me of &amp;#34;The Good Old Days&amp;#34;. Thank You.</li>
    <li> Real men wear this! Wow! What a scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men, this is the smell of gunpowder, courage, and victory!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t listen to the ones that have not been chosen. The Lilac Vegetal (The VEG) chooses you and it&#x27;s a honor to be chosen by the VEG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VEG on real men that wear the Lilac Vegetal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real men rock the VEG daily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings!&lt;br /&gt;In Christ,&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I like the fragrance, which is mild, not overpowering. It soothes my face after shaving, rather than stinging or burning like some stronger ones do.</li>
    <li> I picked this up when I came across it at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, because I love other Clubman after shaves, so I gave it a shot.  I cannot believe this has gotten any favorable reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon my first (and only) use of this, I was shocked at how offensive I found the smell.  Regrettably I had already put it on before I realized this.  My best comparison would have to be a dirty diaper (nos. 1 &amp; 2) that someone had sprayed with a flowery febreze to try to hide the stank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY reason I give it two stars is because it reminded me of the scene from Anchorman involving Sex Panther cologne.  The horror that people experience when Brian Fantana walks around the newsroom wearing it.  \\&quot;Smells like bigfoot&#x27;s dick!\\&quot; And \\&quot;smells like a diaper filled with Indian food!\\&quot; being yelled by those who caught a whiff.  One bonus star because the horrid odor gave me a good laugh thinking of that scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just awful in my opinion.  Saw another reviewer suggest using this as toilet cleaner instead of just tossing it, but I would not want this smell hitting me in the face every time I open the toilet.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it. But I hate it.  I feel the same way about kimchi. I feel like I&#x27;m missing something. I love the original Pinaud Clubman. It&#x27;s my Sunday go to.  I actually tried to wash this one off after about 3 hours but to no avail.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, old fashioned Barber Shop fragrance.</li>
    <li> Oh this scent really took me back.  There I was walking out of the CP in Iraq on one of the hottest days in August.  Not 5 minutes before I heard the TCN&#x27;s cleaning the Port-O-John and I was excited to get the chance to go use it fresh after a good cleaning.  As I am walking up to the Port-O-John and I catch that fresh smell of a urinal cake with the sweet scent of pee that didn&#x27;t quite get sucked up by the Honey Wagon.  For those of you that have been there now know exactly what Clubman Pinaud Lilac Vegetal After Shave Lotion smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give this 1 star is because much like that Port-O-John, I will use this again until I have another option.</li>
    <li> Relatively inexpensive, very nice fragrance - very retro (and my wife really likes it when I use it).</li>
    <li> I love it  I use it  It reminds me of my dad</li>
    <li> Another Great Product Clubman Pinaud. I just love the smell it is nice and subtle aroma.</li>
    <li> I loved the old lilac vegetale. The new one still by Club man is not the same formula. The aroma is not the same. I have an old 6 fluid ounce glass bottle from years ago and the new plastic 12 fluid ounce bottle. The new formula pardon my french stinks in comparison. Club man is just riding on the reputation and aroma of the old product. I would not recommend this nor will I ever buy again. In my book club man products I do not trust you now.</li>
    <li> Holy smokes this stuff smells terrible. I can&#x27;t really describe it. It&#x27;s like a combination of cut grass, fake lilacs and my dead grandma. This is definitely not a scent for anyone under the age of seventy, and that&#x27;s because people that age have already lost their sense of smell.</li>
    <li> Satisfactory purchase</li>
    <li> Unlike some of the other Pinaud after shaves, the faint smell of this lotion stays with you throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lilac Vegetal as an after shave since 1970, and I use to condition my skin and not as a fragrance.  I discovered this in my small town barbershop as a kid, and I loved the way that barbershop smelled as I sat flipping through the pages of Field and Stream  magazine waiting for my turn in the chair. The I discovered I could buy this product in stores and we have been companions ever since. This product is a skin conditioner first and a fragrance as an afterthought. Some products are primarily alcohol as a conditioner and this product definitely has alcohol in it. I love the alcohol burn on my face directly after a shave. But that is not the main reason I love Lilac Vegetal.  The main reason is that it conditions my skin, leaving a pleasant smooth finish after a close shave. My skin never gets dry or chapped or tender.  I use soap and brush for lather and a safety razor.  Men waste a bundle buying today&#x27;s shaving products and I bet I get a closer shave then they do and save $100 plus a year (you can buy a couple of years worth of quality blades on ebay for $15). Aroma is secondary to my after shave needs and most reviews I have seen focus on scent which is like selecting a car because of it&#x27;s paint job. As to the aroma, I find it bracing out of the bottle and mellowing to a subtle  hint of lilac by the time I am at my desk in the morning. It is so subtle that I don&#x27;t think anyone besides me picks up the sent, and if they do, they never say anything.  What I really love is that, late in the day, I can rub my cheeks with my hands and my hands and pick up a subtle fragrance of the outdoors on a spring day.  I wear this to please myself and it has done a fine job of conditioning my face after a shave for 40 plus years. Except during deer season as I go entirely scentless from October through December.  So stop worrying about how you smell and start taking care of your skin.</li>
    <li> Light scented and wonderful. Bought this for the hubby...</li>
    <li> hug bottle of aftershave</li>
    <li> Brings back memories of the old barber shop.  While it is a bit sweet, my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I only give it 4 stars because some people do loathe the Veg. I am not one of them, but since they are out there, I tend to only apply it when I know I&#x27;ll be lounging around the house/not seeing many people. I find the scent wonderful and relaxing.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this aroma on me. Use after shower.</li>
    <li> This is basically a terrific old school after shave that goes on smooth without stinging.  Yes, the lilac fragrance does take some time to used to, but applied sparingly, it will do as expected and does not interfere with your cologne.</li>
    <li> Ahh the classic smell of a French public toilet...I love it.</li>
    <li> i love the smell of this stuff i remember as a kid barber used it on me recommend to anyone ant age</li>
    <li> Great price, timely delivery, still same great product...I will be ordering more...  The clubman products have been around since the 1800&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t changed in my lifetime.  Really that says it all.</li>
    <li> Generally love Cluban products, but this is beyond terrible! I see some reviews stating it smells like a urinal cake, it does, but smells equally like a baby diaper with pee in it. Please avoid this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised no one tried the classic line, \\&quot;Smells like the flesh of an elderly courtesan marinated in a bidet!\\&quot; Actually, it calms down in 5-10 minutes and is a nice tonic - a very effective after shave.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance and feel for an aftershave splash but still has the pinuad core</li>
    <li> I found this product in Walgreens .. I really like the lilac scent.. Made me remember the old days at the barber shop .. I find no problem with this clubman product at all . The smell tones down pretty quick .. It&#x27;s a great aftershave as far as I&#x27;m concerned.. I will order it again ..</li>
    <li> This wonderful stuff is timeless and masculine... it is the REAL DEAL. Best of all, it smells nothing like a 50/50 mix of Patchouli and PINE-SOL, as do most products on the market today.</li>
    <li> I had read all of the warnings that I would either \\&quot;love it or hate it\\&quot; and I definitely find myself loving it the more I use it. Similar to Lime Sec (which I previously reviewed) it smells very odd in the bottle. The first time I splashed it on I didn&#x27;t know what to make of it. After using it for a few days I found myself reaching for \\&quot;The Veg\\&quot; instead of the Lime Sec on warm-weather days. When the weather is cool I prefer classic Clubman After Shave lotion or the Vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: don&#x27;t rush to judgement on Lilac Vegetal. If you&#x27;re a fan of classic manly scents, you&#x27;ll want this in your arsenal.</li>
    <li> This fragrance reminds me of when I was a little kid in the 70&#x27;s and I would go visit my grandmothers friends.  There is nothing flattering about this odor in a bottle.  I should have rusted the reviews that said that it smelled like a funeral home.  Directly into the trash after putting a little bit on my hand to see what it smelled like.</li>
    <li> Remember that one guy, when you were a kid, that was the local bum?  The one that never showered or bathed, and just tried to cover his stench with something from the tester counter at the local pharmacy?  Yeah - this is his essence.</li>
    <li> Never leave home without it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful..I have 8 Clubman bottles of different type,,,but this stuff smells like the wipes you get to wipe yourself...this is going down the drain. All my other Clubman stuff I love..this one no way..Maybe I got a bad one but I doubt it.  Some thought it smelled like damp diapers..sorry Clubman..but this one stinks... I didn&#x27;t know what Lilacs smell like....but I know know..I will never pick them..</li>
    <li> Normally I&#x27;d tire of the same product after a while but not this one.  Been using if for 20+ years.  Sad to report it is no longer available over-the-counter in many drugstores and the like.</li>
    <li> I saw this stuff by accident on Amazon while looking for something else. I took a chance and bought a bottle. AND it is absolutely the same stuff my barber used on me when I was a kid over 50 years ago. Great smell, not offensive, good for a body splash after shower. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> did not like fragrance at all... smelled like a public restroom! sorry just keepin it honest! mixed it with another fragrance and it helped a little.</li>
    <li> I have been using this scent since my teenage years and find it invigorating and bracing. It lasts for hours and always smells great</li>
    <li> All I can say is that when they switched to the latest version or the rounder bottle they changed the formula. I will use this version up and not repurchase this product. It&#x27;s like everything else in this country. It&#x27;s pretty said that when a reasonably priced, quality, old standard goes by the wayside.</li>
    <li> This will take you back a few years to those days of yesteryear and your favorite barber shop.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the regular Clubman Pinaud scent, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  What others have said about both scents is very true - they remind me of barber shop cologne/aftershave.  In a GOOD way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me the floral note of this scent is just a bit too strong.  Not &amp;#34;unmanly&amp;#34; or anything, but I just find that it&#x27;s what sticks out to me most, and it&#x27;s my least favorite part of this scent.  I will gladly wear it, but from now on I&#x27;ll stick with the regular stuff.</li>
    <li> Nice old time fragrant. You will smell good and it is inexpensive. The scent will dissipate fast, it is not an all day after shave.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff that us old guys used to get after a visit to the barber shop. Back when you got a real haircut and they took a straight razor to the back of your neck. Everything was done right, no shortcuts and no skimping. The last thing the barber did was to slap some lilac vegetal on. You smelled great and the gals loved it. I feel sorry for the guys that have had their sense of smell corrupted by all of the processed junk with chemicals added. They really missed out on the good &#x27;ol days. Then again, to each his own, whatever works for you is good. Cheers!</li>
    <li> LISTEN: Everyone has a different nose. Some people taste the berries and tannins and terroir and s*** in wine... and others don&#x27;t. Some can nose it out in coffee or beer, but think all cheese tastes the same. Some guys wear driving hats, others think they look like fat guy hats. Some gentlemen prefer blondes, while others prefer brown haired dudes. I think there are still guys who think it&#x27;s cool to wear a beret, for s***&#x27;s sake. What I&#x27;m getting at it: Let&#x27;s be adult about this. If you like it, you like it- and that&#x27;s really what matters. Nothing else. I&#x27;m not going to make sweeping pronouncements that attempt to nullify every opinion but those which align with my own. That&#x27;s truly not productive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I will say, after ranting for a minute, is that I don&#x27;t care for this too much. I&#x27;ve used this once, today. I actually asked my wife today, while driving home from class, whether my face smelled like piss. And no, I didn&#x27;t read that it smelled like pee then decide that it smelled like pee. I picked this up on a whim since they had it in the local CVS- no previous experience with the pee-smell-claims- scout&#x27;s honor. Anyway- I seriously was getting whiffs of straight whiz while I was wearing this stuff. Now, aside from the whiz, of course, I liked the smell. It&#x27;s fresh and light, and it really felt GREAT on my face- smoother than with old spice, for sure. But every now and then... *SNIFF- \\&quot;Is that piss?\\&quot; So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for me. I really enjoy clubman original, and have for years, but this stuff just aint for me. Hey, if you like the description and have 8 bucks to spare to try it, try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get a faint pee smell, though,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might have peed your pants like me... tehe.</li>
    <li> classic after shave that your grandpa probably wore, odor of&lt;br /&gt;lilac flower. a very fresh smell that most ladies truly love. you&lt;br /&gt;can not go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> Good price.. Smell wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
    <li> Lilac Vegetal is not for everyone.  As they say, you don&#x27;t choose the Veg...It chooses you.  I happen to love the scent of this after shave.  It is a wonderfully floral scent.  It is a truly old world vintage after shave.  Give it a whirl, and hopefully you will be as amazed as I am.</li>
    <li> Excellent, the hard-to-find original from 1980s</li>
    <li> A gift for a friend.  She uses it as a deodorant, (yes, she splashes it on) and it is great for sunburns...cools the skin.  Arrived shortly after order, packaged well and I would order from the same supplier again.</li>
    <li> Either you love it or hate it. I am a big fan of most Clubman Pinaud after shave lotions and colognes. In this category, more than any other shaving products, you really need to compare apples with apples. Some after shaves and colognes cost $80-$100 for 4 oz or  6 oz bottles. Clubman Pinaud Lilac Vegetal is only $8 for 12 oz as is their Lime Sec. Their vanilla scent is only $6 for 8 oz. I cannot afford to order many positively reviewed products in the $60-$100 a bottle range. This is, and has been for 60 years, quite a nice scent and a barbershop staple since my father was alive!</li>
    <li> My favorite after shave,  It is a pleasure to use it, it is like walking back in time, to the elegant 19th and early 20th century.</li>
    <li> I usually do not look at negative reviews, I try to gauge my happiness with a product based on my own opinion. However, I was warned that this stuff was terrible. I ordered it anyway on a hunch. It smelled like a fresh urinal cake, overwhelming and pungent. It went right into the garbage, being that it would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it. All in all, lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Smells like a portal potty and mine arrived in a cracked bottle that leaked everywhere in the box it was absolute junk and a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Being a fan of Clubman Pinaud products, I ordered the Veg to add to my stash. I read one review saying it smelled like a urinal cake. Personally I think the urinal cakes might smell a little better. This product is probably one of those scents that appeals to some and not to others. It definitely does not appeal to me at all. I gave it a chance but to me it&#x27;s kinda like cat urine mixed with flowers.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite Clubman product - the &#x27;Classic Vanilla&#x27; is probably the best - but this one is typical of Clubman aftershaves - a none too subtle smell and at a low price. You will either like or not; there is little middle ground on the Lilac Vegetal. Without question, a distinct floral aroma. Just try it out and see if it appeals to you.</li>
    <li> i  think this is an amazing product that my family has used for over 85 years since my father invented it. i am very pleased that it continues to have such a following</li>
    <li> I have used this off and on since 1982. I remember when the bottles were glass. I always thought it was old-school barber smell. So, I used it. It burns like hell after a close shave. (I used to think that was what an astringent was supposed to do). Since getting married in 1984, my wife has had utter disdain for this smell. I resisted for almost 30 years. Now I didn&#x27;t wear it everyday, but every time I did, I heard about it. A couple of months ago I purchased a bottle of C.O. BIGELOW No. 032 BAY RUM COLOGNE FOR MEN 2.5 fl oz/75 ml. I threw away the Lilac Vegetal the next day. My wife loves the scent and I am out of the dog house.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for its astringent qualities, not for its scent (smell).</li>
    <li> This is an aroma from my childhood and what made it so good back then (and probably 75 years ago when my grandfather probably got a splash of it at the local barber) is what makes it so good now.  It is clean and light and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> great product!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My father who was born in 1899 used this very after shave in his short life of 44 years.&lt;br /&gt;i am 79 years old and have used the after shave all my adult life with great pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joel Brand&lt;br /&gt;jsbfaia@aol.com</li>
    <li> worse smell ever.............  had to shower  after using it......also bottle received was not the one shown.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I like all other clubman scents............. not  this.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite after shave. The store I bought this from in the past stopped stocking it, bummer. So I was happy to find it on line. If you like that old barber shop style after shave lotion, this is it.</li>
    <li> I own all of the Clubman Pinaud line of aftershaves and colognes.  I love them all.  The only one I&#x27;m not too keen on is the Lilac Vegetal.  I&#x27;m not going to say I dislike it, but it definitely is an acquired taste that may not appeal to everyone.  It has the aroma of lilac and a vague medicinal overtone to it.  It&#x27;s not as bad as some of the reviews here have stated, but it&#x27;s just that some scents are not going to appeal to everyone.  If you are a Pinaud fan, like me, you should buy it anyway.  Just for the fun of it.  No matter what anyone says, this company makes great values and you really can&#x27;t go wrong either way.</li>
    <li> Wow, was this a disappointment!  The fragrance was nothing like lilac and it lingered longer than an after shave should.  The staying power is noticeable because the smell is soooooooo unpleasant:  more a chemical smell that someone tried to cover with soap than a pleasant after shave.  Will leave this one for others and stick with Proraso, or Mennen, or Old Spice or motor oil....</li>
    <li> THE LISTING  WAS MISLEADING--I EXPECTED TWO BOTTLES OF 12 OZ  RECEIVED 2 BOTTLES OF 6 OZ. THIS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED</li>
    <li> very good product and has the aroma I wanted.</li>
    <li> I started using this product after I was invited down to the Exclusive Everglades Club in Palm Beach, Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few rounds of golf we showhered up in the men&#x27;s locker room. Lilac Vegetal was available with talcum powder. We had lunch in the Orange Room.</li>
    <li> I know that \\&quot;like\\&quot; is a broad term on a variable scale that most people make on an individual basis according to their own tastes and preferences. Having stated that, I \\&quot;like\\&quot; most of the Edouard Pinaud Clubman line of various fragrance after shave lotions...with a couple standouts I like more than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m struggling with this one...I&#x27;m trying really hard to \\&quot;like\\&quot; the Lilac Vegetal...I really am...but there&#x27;s something about the potent, sickeningly-sweet lilac and/or rose-type floral fragrance that has a distinct funereal air to it, which isn&#x27;t a pleasant scent to me at all...it instantly jams up my nostrils when taking whiffs from the plastic bottle or splashing it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also exhibits a dominant and sharp-edged, over-saturated wet green woods mid-note that tends to sour even more on dry-down that I&#x27;m kinda have a tough time getting past. It&#x27;s really rather off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, REALLY want to like this Pinaud Clubman Lilac Vegetal a lot more...but I can&#x27;t...I just can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that bums me out.</li>
    <li> Smells. Bad. Like a urinal cake. Or a dirty litter box. Seriously.</li>
    <li> This tonsorial standard from the days of men&#x27;s barbershops has virtually disappeared from stores, but is still available at Amazon.com, and at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a refreshing, masculine after shave facial tonic and body splash I&#x27;ve used all my adult life and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product enables the user to acquire the smell of urine. Should you desire to emanate such a rare fragrance, instead of urinating upon your clothing or even your skin, simply purchase and liberally apply this product. In addition to imparting such an unpleasant smell, this product has a long post-application life. Once I applied it after shaving, then took a shower and washed my face and the smell could still be detected. I then washed my face a second time with soap and went to bed; I could still smell the vegetal on my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;  It is unfortunate that this awful product mars the otherwise excellent Pinaud line. I would highly recommend the \\&quot;clubman\\&quot; and \\&quot;bay rum\\&quot; products by the same company, both are excellent masculine aftershaves, without a hint of the scent of urine.</li>
    <li> Classic man&#x27;s aftershave.  Hard to find in stores.  My go to fragrance.  Crisp and refreshing.</li>
    <li> To those who claim this stuff smells like a urinal, urinal cake (It kind of does in the bottle BUT not on the skin), funeral home (WTF does a funeral home smell like?) or whatever creepy adjective they want to use to sound cute or coy, let me squash that right here. This lives up to the Pinaud name. It has a nice floral scent that fades so quick that in 10 minutes you dont even smell anything at all and it leaves your face toned and feeling refreshed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It of course has what you would expect from an aftershave designed for men, alcohol burn, subtle scent, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look man, this stuff smells fine. It is pleasant, cooling and it does the job. Now, it is true, to each his own and each of us have different body chemistry and no two of us like the same thing, particularly with regard to scents. But this stuff is perfectly acceptable and the scent is so minimal anyhow, so give it a try, like all Pinaud products, it is priced to sell and worth a shot. I was not disappointed and I doubt you will be.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a classic, but it is not as universally liked as Clubman.</li>
    <li> I first bought this after shave because it made me smell like  French whorehouse or a barbershop from an old Western move. Not for the faint of heart.</li>
    <li> Unique, maybe not for the faint of heart. I had read that a good practice was to pour a small amount in a cup and let it breath while you shave....sort of like a good wine.  Apply after shaving. Have been following this tip and am a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Took a whiff of the bottle and thought &amp;#34;Well, that&#x27;s money wasted&amp;#34;, but then the next Saturday I splashed some on after my shower. Very nice! As it dries the real scent develops, slightly floral with a strong lilac tone (Lilac, go figure) It&#x27;s not heavy, overpowering nor does it smell like that stuff made for high school boys.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t often wear scents, but I like this one.</li>
    <li> This particular brand has the correct name, Lilac, but is not the same scent as it used to me...totally dissatified and unhappy with the product, cannot use the stuff, it smells bad!</li>
    <li> I started using this because a roommate left some when he moved out, and I really like it.  It can definitely burn, but I kind of like that in an aftershave.  My ex-gf really liked the smell, so she bought me a new bottle when I ran out.  This is definitely my aftershave of choice</li>
    <li> I remember first having this after shave splashed on me at the barber shop in the 1960s, and have always liked it.  But, I can never find it anymore, but did here at Amazon.  The only reason for the 4-star rating is because the shipping was so delayed.  But, it&#x27;s a great product, and I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> When I was growing up back in the fifties every barber shop I went to used to splash this fresh smelling after shave on my neck after a trim. I always loved the scent of lilacs, and the invigorating feeling on my skin.  When I was about thirteen or so I started using it at home. The years went by and I lost track of it.  Then a couple of years ago I got to wonndering if it was still around.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and it went onto my wishlist at once. Now it has become a regular item in my medicine cabinet, and it is just as good as it was when I was a kid.</li>
    <li> This product is as good as sliced bread. This is the stuff that gave you that one of a kind smell you only got at the Barber shop when you were growing up. You could spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on high priced cologne, I&#x27;ll take this anytime over anything. It&#x27;s smell is priceless because nothing smells like it.</li>
    <li> My brothers and I used to gift and re-gift a bottle of Lilac Vegetal to each other at Christmastime - we&#x27;d disguise the packaging so nobody knew who would get it next.  This went on for many years, and I don&#x27;t know what happened to the bottle.  Now I&#x27;ve got my own.  And every whiff brings back memories of those past Christmas &#x27;surprise&#x27; gifts.</li>
    <li> Good product at a GREAT price. Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> This is the best aftershave ever. It leaves your face feeling cool and refreshed after every use. I look forward to shaving now.</li>
    <li> I  love Clubman products generally , but this is some horrible stuff !  Smells like a  used urinal cake  and I&#x27;m not joking.  My wife took one whiff and decided to toss it immediately. I  suggested we pour it on a smelly stray dog that took up at our house, but she thought that would&#x27;ve been cruel .  I can&#x27;t imagine walking around with this stuff on . People will think you have urine on you . Avoid ....</li>
    <li> This is the most god awful stuff i have ever put on, My wife told me it smells like douche and i am just trying to be honest. I won&#x27;t be buying this anymore either.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father. It is like walking into the barbershop all over again as a kid. Not fancy packaging, but it smells great.</li>
    <li> If you are old enough, you remember when the barber used this stuff on you after a haircut.  Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Have used this after shave lotion for over 40 years-strong, refreshing splash after shaving or shower. Still the same and reasonable after all these years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decades ago this was a standard freebie at spas in the midwest-St Louis and Hot Springs</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and it&#x27;s hard for him to find it? Who knew it would be on Amazon! Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Threw bottle away after a few days. Fragrance was not for me.  I can&#x27;t describe the fragrance. Actually made me feel a little queasy. It looked like it would smell good because the bottle and liquid color looked good.</li>
    <li> As they say in the shaving world:  YMMV or &amp;#34;Your Mileage May Vary.&amp;#34;  A lot of people like this aftershave, I&#x27;m not one of them.  The scent is just too strong and too &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; for me.  BUT, what I like and what you like could very well be two different things.</li>
    <li> Husband didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> Good clean after shave splash, memories of going to the barber shop with my father and grandfather. would buy again.</li>
    <li> This product allows me to have that old man smell I love to sport.  I&#x27;m not ready for a night out on the town with my lady until I put a few splashes of this behind my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells a bit like baby powder and cologne.  Its actually a good combination.</li>
    <li> This is a very unique smelling product, and has an essence of something from a frontier town. I wear it three times a week and get compliments on its warm but peculiar aroma. I can see someone from Deadwood having this splashed on after a straight razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the general notes to me are talcum powder, fresh urine, and three day old dead roses. while that sounds like a bad combination, all three play off each other and the sum is more than its parts. i can guarantee you will smell nothing like this from any other product. i do balance it out with it&#x27;s more traditional brother, clubman, for social events, but for every day work this is my go to after shave. you wont invite comparisons to every other jamoke in the club, but will stand out. it isn&#x27;t for everyone, but for those brave enough to give it a shot, you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I use the Clubman original as my everyday scent but this is a nice change of pace. Scent is very floral but not feminine. May take some getting used to if you do not use a floral aftershave of any kind like it did for me but I really like it.</li>
    <li> I am one of the ones that love it.  A great manly scent for an aftershave, originally made for Napoleons Hungarian Cavalry. Some people say it smells like cat pee, but I disagree.  After the drydown it smells like lilac and greenery.  Very manly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after shave as a gift and it was an excellent choice as not only do I enjoy the pleasant fragrance when they wear it but they do as well.</li>
    <li> I love the classic and the Virgin Bay rum scents and I really wanted to like this one too.  Sadly all I can think of when it&#x27;s on my face is that of a port-a-john.  It went into the trash soon after.</li>
    <li> Very good aftershave. Has a mild sent to it. I will order again. It helps that I keep getting compliments about how nice I smell!!</li>
    <li> GYM LOCKER URINAL CAKE SMELL.  not for me but everybody has a different smell and wow talk about different.&lt;br /&gt;I still like there other products and will continue to buy the other After Shaves,,,, but not this one ...</li>
    <li> Great  ... 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20</li>
    <li> I have been thrilled to find the Pinaud line, good smelling after shaves at a really good price.  The fact that they take me back to the barbershops my dad and I used to go to on Saturday morning didn&#x27;t hurt them much either.  In fact, I haven&#x27;t found any of the Pinaud products I didn&#x27;t care for--until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I would have loved to give this product a good review, I just don&#x27;t like it.  The comparison to the aroma of a urinal cake found in other reviews is pretty accurate, at least when you first put it on.  Although urinal cakes don&#x27;t smell bad, they evoke an environment I don&#x27;t want to carry around with me all day.  After a while, the urinal cake smell goes away, and at that point it just smells flowery--a little too flowery for me.  And it lasts a long time (great if you like the smell, not good if you don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose each person has their own preferences, and I have seen some reviews that indicate some people love it.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t.  I would suggest trying a little splash if you can before you buy it, but odds are you&#x27;ll be mail ordering, as it isn&#x27;t easy to find in a store.  This is the only product from the Pinaud line that I don&#x27;t care for--I love the Bay Rum and the Clubman traditional.  You might try it and feel differently.  However, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Blind bought this thinking it would be light and traditional smelling like the old school barber shops. This is a stink bomb! Just horrible smelling .  I would of returned it if the cost of shipping back was not more than the value of the item, I still cannot believe someone could like this smell.  The smell of rotting garbage.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Clubman products but this one has left my home never to return. Without a doubt the worst smelling aftershave ive ever gotten a whiff of. I love the Clubman regular and Bay Rum as well as their talc but this stuff is simply awful. They really need to rethink the formula on this Lilac stuff as it really does stink, literally.</li>
    <li> I can understand some of the negative comments; Lilac Vegetal is very astringent coming out of the bottle.  It does make my skin feel great after shaving, it&#x27;s also nice to put a bit on a kleenex to wipe the day&#x27;s grime off your face.  In the end, it comes down to how it smells on you.  I have a number of expensive colognes, but I never get as many compliments from women as I do with this.  I occasionally mix it with aloe if my blades are old</li>
    <li> I bought this bottle over a year ago and I still have not use half the bottle. Just a bit is going to leave your face feeling cool and fresh and will protect your face after a nice shave. Burns at first, but man up and you will get used to the feeling. Great choice, can&#x27;t go wrong with this after shave.</li>
    <li> I remember getting splashed with this when I made a trip to the barber. It&#x27;s like a trip back in time for me. Also it is refreshing with a light smell that is not cloying or obtrusive.</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite after shave. It&#x27;s tart, it stings, it makes my face feel alive. It smells of the barber shop, not a perfume boutique. And on a hot day, it&#x27;s a great body splash. I&#x27;ve used it happily for five years. Their Eau de Portugal does the same wonderful things for the scalp. They&#x27;re a bifecta.</li>
    <li> It smells like pee.  Utterly awful.  Some have said it smells wonderful, but I don&#x27;t get that at all.  Wow what a polarizing scent.  It takes a bold man to wear this one.</li>
    <li> The Veg is one of those scents you either love or hate, and from what I&#x27;ve read, you have to be &#x27;chosen&#x27; to wear this.  When it arrived, I did NOT like the fragrance at all - in fact, I thought it was horrible.  I&#x27;ve heard that decanting it into glass and letting it settle for a month or two would help, so I tried that.  After a month, the fragrance DID settle down a little - it got to where I could tolerate it, but I don&#x27;t love it.  On the flip side, my college-age daughter really liked it, even before I decanted it and let it sit...but the bottom line is that there are much better aftershaves out there for me (the Clubman and Virgin Island Bay Rum come to mind) that I can use right out of the gate.  I haven&#x27;t given up on this one quite yet, but I&#x27;m close...</li>
    <li> As a fan of other Clubman products, I saw that purchasers of Lilac Vegetal had differing opinions and wanted to determine if it was something I&#x27;d like to add to my wet shaving rotation.  Distinctive smells and flavors seem to inspire strong opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works as good as other aftershaves for its intended use.  I splash on a bit on after I&#x27;ve closed my pores with cold water. The slight burning and tingling Is similar to witch hazel, or other aftershaves.  I like the smell.  It is a little strong in the bottle and definitely distinctive. On the skin it is fresh and light, subtly floral. I&#x27;m a person with no experience at the barbershops of yore. Lilac-Vegetal is just different, and doesn&#x27;t have the smell one would associate with a modern mens aftershave.  The first application was with great trepidation. After a while it settles to just a clean fragrance that is barely noticeable to me and others.  I find myself reaching for it more and more. It kinda grows on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I frequently use Nivea post shave balm as well. It has a very neutral, light fragrance that seems to blend almost perfectly with Lilac Vegetal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is worth a shot. Unique and affordable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll spare you the analogies of what I perceive this smells like.  Suffice to say I&#x27;m in line with the descriptions from others that don&#x27;t find it pleasant.  Folks, the bottom line is this: senses vary from person to person.  We all perceive things differently.  For you, this scent may be it.  For me, it&#x27;s not.  Based on the reviews, I bought this knowing it could go either way.  I like classic clubman and really wanted to try this one, and eventually the others too.  There&#x27;s no need to go further and deride the product.  I don&#x27;t feel slighted at all given the cost of $6 and some change.  So, while my review is 2 stars (which reflects my opinion) for $7 (rounded up) even if you despise it, it shouldn&#x27;t break the bank.  If you&#x27;d rather not chance it and especially if you haven&#x27;t tried the Clubman classic scent, my recommendation would be to purchase that.  Otherwise, you&#x27;re rolling the dice with this one. I haven&#x27;t tried this after shaving yet, with some just on the wrists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: I gave this a true field test after shaving (Edwin Jagger DE8911, Feather blade).  Placed a small amount in cup to air out, as suggested by others.  Also, used less than I normally would with Clubman aftershaves.  Applied using still damp hands to a still slightly wet face.  About 20 minutes later, I had my wife do a blind smell check.  She didn&#x27;t know I had bought this, and I didn&#x27;t tell her what it was.  Her impression?  Smells like urine.  Similarly, I get pee and powder after the dry down, which lingered for at least 3 hours.  So, the consensus was a urine soaked diaper.  If you have/had kids, you know this smell, or if you&#x27;ve worked in nursing homes or hospitals. For me, it&#x27;s all of the above: kids, hospitals and nursing homes.  My wife asked me to get rid of it, and never use it again.  I do agree with others that say it has a nice feel on the face, but I can&#x27;t get past the scent!  To each his own.</li>
