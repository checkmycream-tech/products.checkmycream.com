      <li>Cheap material and breaks the first couple days</li>
      <li>The pink not as bright as the picture</li>
      <li>I love this case it came in way too early</li>
      <li>So far I have 4 cases for my iPhone 6 and this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>The film on the backing comes right off.</li>
      <li>This is definitely I my new favorite case, I&#x27;ll be ordering more in different colors!</li>
      <li>When I ordered this case all I really wanted was a cute clear case to show my phone</li>
      <li>I LIKE IT VERY MUCH</li>
      <li>If not handled very gently the rubber might just slip off the plastic .</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s been pretty good against drops and such nothing major.</li>
      <li>First of all it took weeks to get here</li>
      <li>and im willing to buy another color</li>
      <li>The case is so pretty .</li>
      <li>The picture shows a bright pink and my case is more of a dull faded light purple.</li>
      <li>I was expecting the pink to look more hot like its pictured here.</li>
      <li>Super cheap crappy don&#x27;t buy its not even hot pink!</li>
      <li>But other than that it&#x27;s cheap and not bad quality for what I paid.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really protect much of the front</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect much from it.</li>
      <li>i really like this case</li>
      <li>the pink border looks cute around it.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s now really what I got.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even use it, it went straight to the garbage.</li>
      <li>I really like how it fits my phone though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely lightweight and allows me to feel the shape of my phone and how light it is!</li>
      <li>The clear back scratches really easily</li>
      <li>Glow in the dark love it</li>
      <li>I got the pink and the color is faded and it looks cheap</li>
      <li>Not a big deal, but it&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve received a case that doesn&#x27;t look like the picture.</li>
      <li>and the color was off, it wasn&#x27;t the bright color you see in the picture, I ordered the pink, and well it is glow in the dark which was pretty cool, however I just wasn&#x27;t satisfied :(</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still clear</li>
      <li>far as protection</li>
      <li>I mean it look kinda nice but does not last</li>
      <li>This case was suppose to be hot pink.</li>
      <li>and i like how the pink really came out and how we can see thats a clearly an iPhone  </li>
      <li>The only cool thing is it glows in the dark!</li>
      <li>Plus the pink is much*</li>
      <li>The only problem is that it&#x27;s edges are kinda rough but it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
      <li>In the picture above its a darker pink and when I received it, the color was a light transparent pink that glows in the dark.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a decent case, but I&#x27;m annoyed with how it looks nothing like the one in the picture. The picture shows a bright pink and my case is more of a dull faded light purple. Not a big deal, but it&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve received a case that doesn&#x27;t look like the picture. Just be honest!</li>
    <li> i going to buy other colors it fits great and just love it at night it glows ....</li>
    <li> A little thin but durable!</li>
    <li> The case is so pretty . Yes it meets my expectation.</li>
    <li> Color is a lot lighter that pictures and described. Doesn&#x27;t really protect much of the front, I&#x27;d suggest a good screen protector as well.</li>
    <li> Fit nice. I like the style of it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this case!!! It fits perfectly! It&#x27;s extremely lightweight and allows me to feel the shape of my phone and how light it is! This is definitely I my new favorite case, I&#x27;ll be ordering more in different colors!</li>
    <li> The item was broken on the side and fell into pieces when I put it on my phone.  I will not order from this merchant again.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t even the case I ended up getting different then what it says and picture is wrong</li>
    <li> Love itt highly recommend</li>
    <li> I loved it, and I will most likely be ordering more in different colors! Super thin, shipping just takes a really long time</li>
    <li> This case was suppose to be hot pink. When I got it, it was a pale pink. One plus is that it&#x27;s glow in the dark?? I really like how it fits my phone though. Great buy. Just choose your colors wisely.</li>
    <li> Awesome case took a while to get here but was well worth the wait</li>
    <li> it took over a month to get here and when it got here, it was broken.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS CASE!!! Best 4 dollar case!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Not that good quality&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Loved it great protection and nice looking style</li>
    <li> Great Vendor, Product, and Support&lt;br /&gt;Lasted over 8 months</li>
    <li> Very nice case but however very flimsy . If not handled very gently the rubber might just slip off the plastic . I just currently purchased my iPhone 6 and trying to build my case collection so case is just temporary .</li>
    <li> Wasnt what I expected, horrible plastic i want my money back .</li>
    <li> The case fits my phone perfectly. I like how i can still feel the thinness of my iphone 6. However, after a month of use the back of the case starts to peel off. And it can be easily scratch. But what do you expect from a cheap iphone case. Shipping took forever too.</li>
    <li> Cheap material and breaks the first couple days</li>
    <li> Broke. Terrible put together</li>
    <li> It sucked I broke as soon as I put it on my phone.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this case all I really wanted was a cute clear case to show my phone and that&#x27;s now really what I got. In the picture above its a darker pink and when I received it, the color was a light transparent pink that glows in the dark. It&#x27;s still clear so that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars but if I could go back I wouldn&#x27;t order this case again.&lt;br /&gt;As far as protection it&#x27;s been pretty good against drops and such nothing major. The clear back scratches really easily but that&#x27;s a given with any case built like this.</li>
    <li> It broke after one week</li>
    <li> The side part of the case wasn&#x27;t attached so I can&#x27;t even use the case!</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT VERY MUCH IT DOESN&#x27;T MAKE MY PHONE LOOK BIG</li>
    <li> The case came with one of the rubber sides detached from the phone. It&#x27;s cute and it cheap so I didn&#x27;t expect much from it.</li>
    <li> I love this case it came in way too early so that was a very good thing, i got the color pink because i think its the best color and i like how the pink really came out and how we can see thats a clearly an iPhone  6  i really like this case and im willing to buy another color</li>
    <li> Came Broke, doesn&#x27;t fit phone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute but get dirty very bad</li>
    <li> Fell apart after three days!</li>
    <li> Super cheap crappy don&#x27;t buy its not even hot pink! The film on the backing comes right off.</li>
    <li> It came extra extra late and broke already its very fragile</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give this case a star at all. It is HORRIBLE! I hate it so much! The back scratches very easily! After a couple of days it was covered in scratches. AND the pink color is very dull, not at all like the picture. The pink band along the side is peeling off! As soon as I put the case on it started to come off! Ughhhh if you&#x27;re thinking about buying this case DON&#x27;T! Trust me you&#x27;ll hate it</li>
    <li> The pink around the side falls off the hard plastic, and the color is not what the picture showed. very cheap!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this case. I waited couple of weeks to get it, but when it came I knew I didn&#x27;t like it. It was way to thin for what I needed and I order a blue one and got stuck with a pink one. My case actually broke off the plastic thing. I&#x27;m not very impressed with this at all.</li>
    <li> Broke a little but I put it back together. Also my pink bumper glows in the dark. Wasn&#x27;t labeled as glow in the dark.</li>
    <li> I like it because you can see the gold of the phone and the pink border looks cute around it. Fits well. Can tell it&#x27;s a cheaper case but I have had mine on a couple of weeks and haven&#x27;t had any problems</li>
    <li> Love the case so much. I got the pink one and the color wasn&#x27;t faded at all . Fits phone perfectly the only thing is it did take awhile to get here but it was earlier than the expected delivery date</li>
    <li> So far I have 4 cases for my iPhone 6 and this one is my favorite. I got the white one and it looks great on the gold iPhone. It fits perfect. Will order another one in a different color. It arrived sooner than estimated date.</li>
    <li> Did not like it. It seems like is not going to protect my iPhone. I just plastic. No quality that is why is so cheep!</li>
    <li> Love this case wish they had more colors</li>
    <li> Mines came all scratched already.. The sides of it are starting to come off already! It&#x27;s not good at all.. Plus the pink is much*** lighter than expected to be. The only cool thing is it glows in the dark!</li>
    <li> The pink not as bright as the picture but I like the case I like how it look on my phone and my case glow up in the dark</li>
    <li> Could have given a 5 but the case it&#x27;s too flimsy I feel like it won&#x27;t protect it. Shipping didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
    <li> Love this case. Use it everyday</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I got this case. First of all it took weeks to get here and when it did , it looked used and had been all scratched up. I don&#x27;t recommend this case at all. It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture . I got the pink and the color is faded and it looks cheap</li>
    <li> It was a great case, but it only lasted for about a week! THE &amp;#34;COLORED&amp;#34; PORTION WAS FALLING OFF THE HARD CLEAR PLASTIC! Almost like peeling off :( and the color was off, it wasn&#x27;t the bright color you see in the picture, I ordered the pink, and well it is glow in the dark which was pretty cool, however I just wasn&#x27;t satisfied :( but hey it was hella cheap, a dollar or so, what could I expect? ALL IN ALL, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR</li>
    <li> This does not look how it is made to be and the pink part tore off I mean it look kinda nice but does not last</li>
    <li> This case seems kind of cheap not as study as I would have liked</li>
    <li> Fits great and love the fact that it glows in the dark!</li>
    <li> Not happy with product. Very cheap quality. I didn&#x27;t even use it, it went straight to the garbage.</li>
    <li> Glow in the dark love it</li>
    <li> Very good case, very protective. Got here a week earlier than expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not how it looked on the computer</li>
    <li> wish I could give it 0stars</li>
    <li> Not as pink as the picture but it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. The rubber came off of mine within 2 days. I emailed them to see if I could Send it back and I NEVER got an email back.</li>
    <li> Case makes it hard to press on the volume button and lock buttom</li>
    <li> I already resive it tankyou</li>
    <li> Product is oooooookay.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very thin. The perimeter glows in the dark though lol</li>
    <li> This case protects the phone pretty well surprisingly. It&#x27;s very thin and allows the opportunity to show off the natural color of the iPhone without leaving it too unprotected. I&#x27;ve only dropped my phone in this case a few times and my phone has yet to be damaged. I was expecting the pink to look more hot like its pictured here. But other than that it&#x27;s cheap and not bad quality for what I paid.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice case and kinda glow at night! The only problem is that it&#x27;s edges are kinda rough but it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much. Overall it&#x27;s good!</li>
