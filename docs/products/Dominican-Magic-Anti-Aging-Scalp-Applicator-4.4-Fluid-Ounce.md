<li> Makes my hair dry don&#x27;t like it.</li>
<li> and I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my scalp, still dry and flaky and my hair</li>
<li> On the other hand I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and it works wonders.</li>
<li> IT GETTING THICKER AND IS GROWING PLUS LESS SHEDDING.</li>
<li> The product arrived op[en and half of the product in the bottle.</li>
<li> My hair dresser even marvels at how heavy my hair has gotten.</li>
<li> I think this product is a waste of money.</li>
<li> but if you use it everyday after two months you WILL see hair growth.  </li>
<li> My hair grew 4inches in just a few months bc of this product.</li>
<li> and there is no more breakage or shedding.  </li>
<li> My hair had begun to thin due to blow drying, and probably medicine as well.  </li>
<li> Since using this product I have noticed that I have less hairline receding, and my hair has thickened-although it wasn&#x27;t that thin to begin with.</li>
<li> it was still sealed) it was slowly leaking out,</li>
<li> and my hair started growing in places where it had broken off and thickening where it was thinning.  </li>
<li> I received my products but bottles were cracked and it spilled all ove the box, I don&#x27;t know if this is a packing issue, but it is very disappointing to receive a box that it&#x27;s leaking all the products.</li>

    <li> Good product. Use for problem hair that is thinning or damaged. Buy products. Hair is in much better shape.Try it.</li>
    <li> I love the product, I ordered 2 but one of the boxes/bottles was shipped and I guess somehow thru the applicator(cause it was still sealed) it was slowly leaking out, carton/container was damp/wet</li>
    <li> This product really works!  It takes time but if you use it everyday after two months you WILL see hair growth.  I was a skeptic but I tried it and it works.  If you have a relaxer or natural hair the nice thing is that if feels like water but it dries quickly after you massage it in and there is no more breakage or shedding.  Thanks Dominican.</li>
    <li> This product has made my hair thicker and softer. I haven&#x27;t seen any tremendous growth but I only been using it for 2 weeks however I will recommend this product for damage hair it works great.</li>

On the other hand I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and it works wonders. I have new hair growing over my hairline. My hair is growing pretty fast. After seeing results I went to buy all hair product from Dominican Magic.</li>

    <li> WOW wonderful products I have tremendous growth!!!Thanks Dominican Magic!!!I  I also will purchased other Dominican Magic Products. The serum leaves your hair very shiny and healthy</li>
    <li> The product is great it makes my hair healthier. I noticed that the first week that I started to use it. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My hair had begun to thin due to blow drying, and probably medicine as well.  I started putting this in my hair daily and my hair started growing in places where it had broken off and thickening where it was thinning.  I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, the first bottle  works well on me, but the second bottle not works as well as the first one.( I bought the first one in store)</li>
    <li> Since using this product I have noticed that I have less hairline receding, and my hair has thickened-although it wasn&#x27;t that thin to begin with. My hair dresser even marvels at how heavy my hair has gotten. I have received complements on how gorgeous my hair is. I REFCOMMEND THSI PRODUCT TO ANY AND EVERYONE!!!</li>
    <li> My hairstylist saw a differnce. I wear protective styles(braids) it is a good oil for your scalp with a cooling sensation.</li>
    <li> My hair was falling out in chunks! My friend mentioned this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. I have seen much improvement in my hair. It&#x27;s not falling out as much. Probably now the normal amount of hair one loses from day to day, but there is growth of new hair. It feels thicker and stronger. I like it!</li>
    <li> loss of hair at top &amp; sides, my hair stylist really see the difference. I still contiue to use this.</li>
    <li> I like using the product to protect against hair loss. It soothes the scalp. I spoils recommend it to anyone especially if you wear weaves or hair extentions.</li>
    <li> Great product works very well in my hair.</li>
    <li> It actually works!!!!!! Great product for anyone who is losing hair!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I will not waste my time with this product.  Used the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair.  I think this product is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> So I brought this product via amazon in November 2012 and I can say that my hair is getting thicker. I have been using this product for about 4months now about every day. I can definitely feel the difference and so can my hairdresser which I see 2x a month. The product came quickly in the mail with no problems.  I am giving it 12months to see if it can help thicken up my hairline. Will send out a new set of comments then.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tingling, scalp treatment after having it used on my hair at a local Dominican salon! I texted myself the name of the product &amp; looked for it on Amazon. I found it here &amp; signed up for auto-delivery...then, I read the ingredients! Filled with Parabens &amp; other, cheap, synthetic fillers...no bueno... Sent my last shipment back &amp; canceled the auto-delivery. READ YOUR LABELS &amp; INGREDIENTS! Opt for natural, organic ingredients when given the opportunity.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for awhile (3-4months) and it has been doing a tremendous job. It stop my hair from breaking and has actually made it thicker.....LOVE this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of the reviews that I read.  I received Dominican Magic and I have been using it for about 3 weeks.  I have noticed that my hair has stopped coming out as much when I comb it, as it was before I started using Dominican Magic I am pleased with the results that I am getting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK so far no results</li>
    <li> Makes my hair dry don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my scalp, still dry and flaky and my hair is still thinning. I&#x27;m going to finish the bottle and hope that changes are in the future</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS NOW. I USE IT EVERY DAY AND CAN TRULY SEE A DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR. IT GETTING THICKER AND IS GROWING PLUS LESS SHEDDING. I WOULD ALSO GIVE A YEAR TO SEE HOW IT WORK. I WILL UPDATE!!</li>
    <li> Just started using this so, it&#x27;s still a bit early to give a full assessment on this product. With what I&#x27;ve used thus far I am happy with it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s strong and I feel it working already, I have only been using this product for two weeks now......you should try it.</li>
    <li> I find it to really work at keeping my hair healthy it&#x27;s a great buy that&#x27;s call I have to say</li>
    <li> I heard about Dominican magic through commercial advertisements. So, I decided to try this production. I didn&#x27;t purchase this through Amazon. I actually went to Target instead of Amazon, because I knew that it would be easier to return it.  Anyway, I&#x27;ve been natural for a year now and often I will try a new product if it can enhance my hair journey.  I will say that all products that anyone uses, doesn&#x27;t work well with everyone. Yesterday, 8-13, I washed my hair added my leave in conditioner then applied the application. My scalp started to tingle. That kind of worried me. So I did my nightly routine and the next day,  my ends were really soft.</li>
    <li> Great for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> Product just doesn&#x27;t work....</li>
