      <li>I highly recommend and I will be using this for many many years to come.</li>
      <li>just nice, soft skin (I&#x27;m in my mid-30s)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It feels so good, even next day</li>
      <li>Only really good results.</li>
      <li>Although to be honest, it doesn&#x27;t really make that particular claim.  </li>
      <li>I just started using it, and I really do like it!!</li>
      <li>the smell reminds me of an old lady cream !!!!!  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price,</li>
      <li>, i&#x27;m kind of a &#x27;low maintenance\\&quot; person.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I just wish Olay had made this warning a little more prominent</li>
      <li>I could tell a difference the first use.&lt;br /&gt;Olay</li>
      <li>the lines under my eyes are exactly what i felt made me look</li>
      <li>first morning I woke up after using this</li>
      <li>It Really Works !  </li>
      <li>and it was the old original version ....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simply a fairly good moisturizer is all, and you can get those for the same money in a lot larger bottle if you look.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t notice a positive difference on my face.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and has a very \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; feeling after being applied.</li>
      <li>The price on Amazon is absolutely much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
      <li>I adore it so much.</li>
      <li>I really like this night cream.</li>
      <li>I now use them all.&lt;br /&gt;Order came fast , new and packaged well in a box.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>It really mositurizes, and makes my face feel so soft.</li>
      <li>No mean feat for a 48yr old.</li>
      <li>I used to suffer from hormonal monthly breakouts, but I&#x27;ve had none so far since using this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but it make my skin feel soft.</li>
      <li>and I wake up with silky soft skin.</li>
      <li>NOT HEAVY OR GREASY</li>
      <li>Plus my skin is prone to dryness, and fairly sensitive to products.  </li>
      <li>This cream makes my face soft and helps with dryness.</li>
      <li>so I can see how much I have left.</li>
      <li>and I actually notice my fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
      <li>I would especially recommend this to people who are just starting to notice age lines or are trying o prevent them, after all, we all get older! .</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t use it frequently enough (due to not being able to put it around the eyes) to have noticed a change in skin, but maybe I will after reading the other reviews.  </li>
      <li>However, if you have acne prone skin, or generally just oily skin, this probably isn&#x27;t the moisturizer for you.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this only because I myself have sensitive skin issues and never had a reaction to this product.</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s a cream, it&#x27;s thick and this is not oil free.</li>
      <li>In fact, when I first started using this product my face was red and irritated from my previous cream and this soothed it.</li>
      <li>In my previous reviews I stated Nothing can turn the hands of time backwards, but this really helps.</li>
      <li>and I have regular (not oily and not dry) skin.  </li>
      <li>Yes I know some people try a dab, and next day they claim results but that&#x27;s just because we WANT to see something work, but if you really take pictures or write it down...</li>
      <li>After having my second baby recently, my skin became very sensitive, so I decided to look for new products with fewer ingredients that aren&#x27;t harsh.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this night cream.  It keeps me hydrated through the night and I can feel the moisture when I wake.  I does NOT feel greasy on my skin and I have regular (not oily and not dry) skin.  I will also mention that when I started using this product...no joke, I had four people tell my my skin looked great in the following two weeks.  Great product if you are looking for a useful night cream without the department store counter prices.  I recommend to all my friends and would give it a try at least once to see if it works for you.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I am noticing that my skin is smoother and it seems to be firmer under my chin  and on my neck. In the morning I can tell that it&#x27;s still \\&quot;working\\&quot; because of the way my skin feels. However I have some small wrinkles under my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have improved their appearance, nor does it seem to have any effect on evening skin tone.  Although to be honest, it doesn&#x27;t really make that particular claim.  The price on Amazon is absolutely much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> After I had purchased this product (not on Amazon) I discovered that it warns \\&quot;do not use around eyes or on eyelids.\\&quot;  My crows feet and the lines under my eyes are exactly what i felt made me look \\&quot;aged!\\&quot;  (I am 35).  I haven&#x27;t thrown it out, but i get annoyed that i have to use a different product around my eyes, i&#x27;m kind of a &#x27;low maintenance\\&quot; person.  i don&#x27;t use it frequently enough (due to not being able to put it around the eyes) to have noticed a change in skin, but maybe I will after reading the other reviews.  Anyway, I just wish Olay had made this warning a little more prominent so I had not made that mistake.</li>
    <li> Im second generation Olay user. I would recommend this only because I myself have sensitive skin issues and never had a reaction to this product. Only really good results.</li>
    <li> This product is very smooth, and has a wonderful fragrance, and nothing will take my wrinkles away, but I figure it&#x27;s worth a shot.  I just started using it, and I really do like it!!</li>
    <li> I had no idea what to get.  I was using Hope In a Jar by Philosophy which is good but I didn&#x27;t want to spend quite so much anymore for a few ounces of moisturizer.  I started trying different products including my regular body lotion, Aveeno, for my face.  I ended up having small bumps around my mouth--it may have also been the makeup I was using at that time contributing to the breakouts.  I ended up of just grabbing this Oil of Olay Age Defying Night cream at a store one day and was shocked at how quickly it helped my skin clear up.  Plus my skin is prone to dryness, and fairly sensitive to products.  I found this to be a great fit for my skin type--no more breakouts since using it, and my skin is moisturized at night, but it&#x27;s not a heavy or greasy feel.  I finally looked up the active ingredients on the Oil of Olay site and noticed it has salycic (sp?) acid in it.  So that explains, in part, why it&#x27;s worked so well against my breakouts.  I would definitely buy and use this again.</li>
    <li> I really like this night cream. After having my second baby recently, my skin became very sensitive, so I decided to look for new products with fewer ingredients that aren&#x27;t harsh. This cream makes my face soft and helps with dryness. In fact, when I first started using this product my face was red and irritated from my previous cream and this soothed it. No redness. I&#x27;m not sure it makes me look younger, but my skins looks good and more importantly feels good, so I am happy. I also like that it is in a jar, not a pump bottle so I can see how much I have left. A little goes a long way. And, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I am very happy to get this product, and my skin is looking great&lt;br /&gt;It feels so good, even next day</li>
    <li> Started to make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice a positive difference on my face. Too oily, I have combination skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;Vital in my skincare routine!&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and feels amazing!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amankkhaira.com/2015/05/drugstore-skincare-routine.html</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd order of this. I use it every night and I actually notice my fine lines are less noticeable. This actually does what it claims. In my previous reviews I stated Nothing can turn the hands of time backwards, but this really helps. I would especially recommend this to people who are just starting to notice age lines or are trying o prevent them, after all, we all get older! . It&#x27;s non-greasy, has a light but nice smell and I wake up with silky soft skin. No mean feat for a 48yr old. I use a different brand for day, and have tried most everything, this seems to work the best.. Well worth the price,</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month and I love it!!  It really mositurizes, and makes my face feel so soft. When I wake up in the morning my face feels wonderfuly smooth and hydrated. Im really glad I got thisproduct.</li>
    <li> Love this night cream. Smells nice, is not greasy and does it job.</li>
    <li> Works well for my skin.</li>
    <li> Out of all my lotions I have tried, I finf this one to be the best.  They all work different on different skin types, but this is the one I will ALWAYS use.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for about two months and I havent seen any results with my fine lines or anything but it make my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> I did not realize what this product was I thought it was a newer version and it was the old original version ....I guess that is my fault !! the smell reminds me of an old lady cream !!!!!  Ew[...] am only 55!</li>
    <li> Super duper happy with purchase. Fantastic price!</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use this night cream. We agree that it has a good feel and believe it may indeed be improving the appearance of our skin. So far, so good. Recommended!</li>
    <li> It Really Works !  I could tell a difference the first use.&lt;br /&gt;Olay age defying line of products are excellent. I now use them all.&lt;br /&gt;Order came fast , new and packaged well in a box.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the company and the product!</li>
    <li> fast delivery and great produce</li>
    <li> This definitely does the trick in terms of moisturizing. However, if you have acne prone skin, or generally just oily skin, this probably isn&#x27;t the moisturizer for you. Because it&#x27;s a cream, it&#x27;s thick and this is not oil free. It was too heavy for me and left my skin feeling oily.</li>
    <li> I researched reviews before I bought this night cream and it exceeded my expectations. It goes on very soft and silky and is not at all irritating (my skin is sensitive) and there is no strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;The first morning I woke up after using this I saw a huge difference, I couldn&#x27;t believe how gorgeous my skin looked! It was like looking at my skin in the mirror when I was a kid...just nice, soft skin (I&#x27;m in my mid-30s). I&#x27;ve been using this about a month and my skin is flawless and gorgeous! I used to suffer from hormonal monthly breakouts, but I&#x27;ve had none so far since using this.&lt;br /&gt;I also got the day cream version of this which I like a lot too but sometimes use the night cream during the day cause I adore it so much. It shrinks my pores and makes my skin even and is perfect for my combination skin. (It&#x27;s not at all greasy, yet takes care of any dry spots).&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I highly recommend and I will be using this for many many years to come.</li>
    <li> love the feel of my skin.  It hydrates it with a glow.  This is my secret to looking young...  I apply every night and splash cold water in the morning.</li>
    <li> I tried this for several months and never missed and all to see almost no results at all. It&#x27;s simply a fairly good moisturizer is all, and you can get those for the same money in a lot larger bottle if you look. The ADVERTISEMENT says, it helps to decrease WRINKLES and it does no such thing. Yes I know some people try a dab, and next day they claim results but that&#x27;s just because we WANT to see something work, but if you really take pictures or write it down...nothing changes, except your wallet is lighter just like all these companies do to us.</li>
    <li> Great buyer and arrived on time. I would recommend this night cream to anybody wanting to have smooth,supple skin. It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking and looking for a product that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out (the product that I have used for years has been discontinued). This works well for my oily/dry combination skin. It isn&#x27;t greasy and has a very \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; feeling after being applied. I will definitely be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> Good night cream with a light peachy smell.  Moisturizes well, but doesn&#x27;t leave face feeling greasy.  A good product - thanks!</li>
    <li> HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS.  NOT HEAVY OR GREASY LIKE OTHER CREAMS.  DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND IT. TELL OLAY TO PUT IT BACK ON THE SHELVES.</li>
</ol>
