      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Handle is good--blades are great.</li>
      <li>I felt that this was a great value.  </li>
      <li>Not bad, but not the best shavette and not the best blades, but a good value for the amount paid.</li>
      <li>Good way to save money when you use it 5 days a week.</li>
      <li>The blades are good.</li>
      <li>The first time I experienced these blades is when a mate of mine was training to become a barber shaved my head.</li>
      <li>Does the job well and is very cheap.</li>
      <li>Quality could be better but it does the job.</li>
      <li>It has been more than 2 years</li>
      <li>Too many blades to count.</li>
      <li>but there is a reason most men now a days shave with cartridge razors.</li>
      <li>OK.  </li>
      <li>top notch for getting striaght even trim lines, and a close shave for literally pennies.  </li>
      <li>And I must admit, the quality you get for the price is outstanding.</li>
      <li>The free handle works well for a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; handle.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s built well, dirt cheap</li>
      <li>I wanted to try it out on the cheap.  </li>
      <li>It feels cheap and plastic because it is both cheap and plastic.  </li>
      <li>and wow feels good.</li>
      <li>Not as good looking as a straight razor but highly recommended to start with.</li>
      <li>This product is cheap and useless,not worth the money or time.</li>
      <li>I started using these blades about 14 years ago and when the plant that makes the blade switched to a modern process of sharpening the blades become better and sharper.</li>
      <li>It is a really good razor for starters, Derby blades are sharp to do their job without any problem and they&#x27;re easy to change.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>When I have two or three day beard growth it shaves well to prepare for quick once-over with triple blade safety razor.  </li>
      <li>Barber needed inexpensive straight razor one time blades easy to change.</li>
      <li>While shaving with a straight razor will give you the closest shave you have ever experienced and give you an old timey feeling of classy nostalgia...</li>
      <li>Its so smooth when I use the derbys in my parker straight razor.</li>
      <li>, there&#x27;s no need to sharpen the blade, and you will always have plenty of fresh blades for it.</li>
      <li>That is right</li>
      <li>The straight razor itself is really straight forward and pretty easy to use.  </li>
      <li>These little razors cost about a penny each so with 300 of these I can shave for almost a whole year, straight razors are way better and more precise.</li>
      <li>but it can be fixed easily.</li>
      <li>You have to pay close attention while shaving, you need to do the whole process twice for a super close shave, and there&#x27;s quite a bit of trial and error involved.</li>
      <li>Good starting point for someone new to straight razor shaving.</li>
      <li>It scared me at first</li>
      <li>So I decided to try out this inexpensive straight razor with 2 years worth of replaceable blades.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I thought I was getting..</li>
      <li>but the results are better than standard razor.</li>
      <li>Nice blades, sharp enough to provide a defined line (I have a beard) but need to be tossed after second use, good thing I got a 300 pack.</li>
      <li>Amazing value for less than the price of a pack of Gillette cartridges.  </li>
      <li>Surprisingly with the new blades I noticed less nicks!</li>
      <li>The blade replacement is quick and easy without all the maintenance of a conventional straight razor.</li>
      <li>With a standard razor you almost had to shave every day to keep a shinny smooth head.</li>
      <li>you want to try shaving with a straight razor</li>
      <li>The reason that I didn&#x27;t give this problem is that shaving with a straight razor is a pain in the butt.</li>
      <li>But most importantly shaving with a straight razor takes at least 3 times longer then with modern cartridge razors.</li>
      <li>this is a very inexpensive product with a surprisingly high level of quality to it...</li>
      <li>These are sharp, ready, and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Decent quality but NOT designed to be top-of-the-line.</li>
      <li>The blade sticks out way too much, sticks out nearly 4 mm...returned mine and got another instead.  </li>
      <li>Worth the purchase solely for the sheer number of blades!</li>
      <li>Update with the new blades you can skip shaving for 3 days and not look like sandpaper head.</li>
      <li>This gives the shaver a chance to use a new blade for every shave.</li>
      <li>I am not a morning person and I am not willing to wake up 10 minutes earlier to be able to shave with one of these before work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this to someone who is looking into dabbling with straight razors, it is under 20 bucks and the blades will work with pretty much any other handle you can find.</li>
      <li>individually paper wrapped inside the box, works with the Dovo stainless steel blade handle</li>
      <li>They start out very sharp, although I don&#x27;t like to use them more than 3 times; they seem like they don&#x27;t retain their edge for too long.</li>
      <li>Blades are very sharp, and shavette loads the blades easily, the razor is a little cheap looking and feels a little flimsy, but it does the job.</li>
      <li>It fits the hand well and fells like a conventional straight razor.  </li>
      <li>I guess I was expecting a little bit too much for the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Barber needed inexpensive straight razor one time blades easy to change. Good way to save money when you use it 5 days a week.</li>
    <li> 300 blades.  That is right, if you shave almost every day and use the same blade 3-4 times, this pack will last you 3-4 years.  Amazing value for less than the price of a pack of Gillette cartridges.  I decided to plunge into the world of single bladed shaving because I hated paying so damn much for cartridges, and I was feeling a bit adventurous at the time.  I searched through rec recommendations and reviews, and I decided to go with this pack.  I wanted a safety razor, but they were a bit pricey for me to justify a purchase.  I wanted to try it out on the cheap.  I picked up this kit.  The razors that come in neatly packaged boxes are very sharp.  I have had them last 5-6 shaves before I tossed them.  The straight razor itself is really straight forward and pretty easy to use.  It feels cheap and plastic because it is both cheap and plastic.  I felt that this was a great value.  It has been more than 2 years and I am still trucking with the same blades and razor.  I would definitely recommend this to someone who is looking into dabbling with straight razors, it is under 20 bucks and the blades will work with pretty much any other handle you can find. (If you want to upgrade to something fancy)</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re razor blades.. individually paper wrapped inside the box, works with the Dovo stainless steel blade handle&lt;br /&gt;2 inches in length</li>
    <li> Great starter razor.  300 blades so it will pay for itself in no time. Blades are very sharp, and shavette loads the blades easily, the razor is a little cheap looking and feels a little flimsy, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting a little bit too much for the price. Quality could be better but it does the job.</li>
    <li> It is a really good razor for starters, Derby blades are sharp to do their job without any problem and they&#x27;re easy to change.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem y found is that the handle-razor joint may split apart but it can be fixed easily.</li>
    <li> The blade sticks out way too much, sticks out nearly 4 mm...returned mine and got another instead.  sliding functionality I did like.</li>
    <li> Serioulsy if there are blades out there with less drag I&#x27;d be amazed. Its so smooth when I use the derbys in my parker straight razor.</li>
    <li> Worth the purchase solely for the sheer number of blades! Exactly what I thought I was getting.. Decent quality but NOT designed to be top-of-the-line.</li>
    <li> The blades are good. They start out very sharp, although I don&#x27;t like to use them more than 3 times; they seem like they don&#x27;t retain their edge for too long. Does the job well and is very cheap. Not as good looking as a straight razor but highly recommended to start with.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because as we all know shaving is expensive. Razor cartridges cost a fortune. So I decided to try out this inexpensive straight razor with 2 years worth of replaceable blades. And I must admit, the quality you get for the price is outstanding. The razor is well built and the blades are sharp. The reason that I didn&#x27;t give this problem is that shaving with a straight razor is a pain in the butt.

While shaving with a straight razor will give you the closest shave you have ever experienced and give you an old timey feeling of classy nostalgia...I&#x27;m sticking with my Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try shaving with a straight razor this product is ideal for the beginner. It&#x27;s built well, dirt cheap, there&#x27;s no need to sharpen the blade, and you will always have plenty of fresh blades for it. I wholehearted recommend this product, it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Good starting point for someone new to straight razor shaving. I would recommend it.  This gives the shaver a chance to use a new blade for every shave.</li>
    <li> Great set of razors. One razor gives me about 3 shaves.</li>
    <li> Great product. Too many blades to count. The only bad thing is the factory straight blade holder, made to cheap and not comfortable  to hold ditch the razor keeps the blades.</li>
    <li> When I have two or three day beard growth it shaves well to prepare for quick once-over with triple blade safety razor.  The free handle works well for a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; handle.  It fits the hand well and fells like a conventional straight razor.  One little draw back, with the handle, is a little vibration in shaving with the blade.  The blade replacement is quick and easy without all the maintenance of a conventional straight razor.</li>
    <li> i have to save but i hate it. i got this for some pain less shaving and wow feels good. still cut alot after 4 days but i could use any shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I started using these blades about 14 years ago and when the plant that makes the blade switched to a modern process of sharpening the blades become better and sharper. The first time I experienced these blades is when a mate of mine was training to become a barber shaved my head. It scared me at first but the results are better than standard razor. With a standard razor you almost had to shave every day to keep a shinny smooth head. With these blades you can skip a day. Update with the new blades you can skip shaving for 3 days and not look like sandpaper head. Surprisingly with the new blades I noticed less nicks!</li>
    <li> Derby single edge blades gives me a shave that equals a srtaight edge razor without the trouble off a srraight</li>
    <li> This product is cheap and useless,not worth the money or time. I would have returned it, but had thru the recept away by accident</li>
    <li> Five Blades, Three, Blades, Two Blades, How about 1 blade?  These are sharp, ready, and easy to use.  This was my second order.  top notch for getting striaght even trim lines, and a close shave for literally pennies.  Handle is good--blades are great.</li>
    <li> OK.  Not bad, but not the best shavette and not the best blades, but a good value for the amount paid.</li>
    <li> Nice blades, sharp enough to provide a defined line (I have a beard) but need to be tossed after second use, good thing I got a 300 pack.</li>
    <li> No more razor bumps or expensive cartridges. These little razors cost about a penny each so with 300 of these I can shave for almost a whole year, straight razors are way better and more precise.</li>
