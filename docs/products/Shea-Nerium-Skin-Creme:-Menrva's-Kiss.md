      <li>The results have been absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>I think the person who makes the cream as a nice idea of combining tree goods ingredients</li>
      <li>product is nice after being warmed 20 seconds in microwave to soften consistency --</li>
      <li>sure that I see the nerium affects, but its a good body moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it will make the noticeable difference I am hoping for, but once I warm it up in my hands it goes on nicely.  </li>
      <li>I love the product itself , and the smooth texture it has when i put in on my face,and the fragrance alone is very nice.</li>
      <li>Really easy to put in your skin, the day cream is my favorite!</li>
      <li>I think it probably works as well as that +100.00 Nerium with a much better price tag.  </li>
      <li>I also feel as though my make up (foundation) goes on more evenly.  </li>
      <li>So glad I tried this cream...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest adding aloe vera to your product as I&#x27;ve never ordered a product which required me to purchase another for it to work BETTER</li>
      <li>If you put this on your feet, make sure you rub it in well before getting between the sheets.  </li>

      <li>Top notch product.  </li>
      <li>I think my skin looks better since I started using Memra&#x27;s Kiss.</li>
      <li>: At bedtime, I wash my face with a clean, warm cloth; pick an aloe leaf from the dozen plants in my kitchen window, thank the plant, then smear the aloe juice on my face; put about 1/4 t. on each cheek, chin, and forehead.</li>
      <li>This is a great product I highly recommend and have recommended to some of my friends who have ordered as well because they can see the improvement in my skin even after a week.  </li>
      <li>I order this product because I saw the reviews that some customers where using this product as a replacement of the original Nerium AD night cream, so I want it to check it out!</li>
      <li>It is superbly moisturizing, and has not caused a single blemish to crop up on my face.  </li>
      <li>This softens the crème so that it can be easily applied.</li>
      <li>that I can easily put an spf lotion over it and</li>
      <li>cheap, naturals ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Cons.</li>
      <li>wake up in morning with Smooth skin</li>
      <li>Using a clean, warm cloth again, I gently wipe my face and hands.</li>
      <li>I can put it as much as I need, and always absorbs and leaves a very clean and smooth sensation without  feeling greasy</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>The warmth is actually wonder and has so much shea butter that skin looks and feels great after use.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>but she needs to work on the product quality, a lot of people live a very fast life you won&#x27;t have the time to warm up the container to make it runny</li>
      <li>I will be back for more!</li>
      <li>(They also offer a product that has four times as much nerium (oleander)!!  </li>
      <li>I feel that it really helps to tighten my skin!!</li>
      <li>It also has a very granular texture which doesn&#x27;t go on your skin smoothly.</li>
      <li>I now apply Menrva&#x27;s Kiss a couple of times a week to maintain natural healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My bright red cheeks and nose are almost normal skin color again; this lasts for about 16 hours.</li>
      <li>My skin looks healthy and glowing, and I will continue to repurchase this as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>I do use it several days in a row, the bright red is significantly diminished all day and evening.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say much for the smell but it dissipates quickly.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend Menrva&#x27;s Kiss Skin Crème for maintenance of natural healthy skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t exactly expecting that.</li>
      <li>Very greasy!  </li>
      <li>I purchased my first jar of Menrva&#x27;s Kiss Shea Nerium Skin Crème on recommendation of a friend.</li>
      <li>so you can spread it over and also the smell, who wants to smell like peanut butter all day!</li>
      <li>I love how long this jar has lasted.</li>
      <li>You must put it in your hand to warm it up in order to smooth I on your face as it is truly very thick, but my skin soaks it up within 30 minutes.  </li>
      <li>On a business trip, I encountered a brother/sister team at a convention selling the nerium stuff that costs so much.</li>
      <li>It is very effectivel...</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really recommend it because of that.</li>
      <li>It is very emollient but doesn&#x27;t stay greasy.</li>
      <li>thank you so much for a product that i can see myself buying again,</li>
      <li>this really helps...</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was so pleased with the results of Menrva&#x27;s Kiss that I have purchased it for other friends.</li>
      <li>I am an older person who needs all the help she can get...</li>
      <li>Higher price, you can only get it trough a brand partner (if you want the real deal!)</li>
      <li>Once applied, the crème dries to a smooth natural look within a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wanted to try Nerium cream but didn&#x27;t like the high prices.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this lotion</li>
      <li>i highly recommend this cream.</li>
      <li>so does it make it less effective &amp; if so may be reason Inot seeing such a great difference results...or such slow results...</li>
      <li>This is the first company that started to extract the oleander (also is the only company that has the patent of the extraction, which puts the question mark on Menrva&#x27;s kiss, is it really oleander what it is in the jar or something else?).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not able to give an honest review..too early to tell..?</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any new benefits from the nerium.</li>
      <li>It is very rich but hard to get out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Not very creamy.</li>
      <li>During my first week of use, I applied Menrva&#x27;s Kiss on a daily basis after my morning shower.</li>
      <li>I hope to see marked improvement in that area as well!  </li>
      <li>at first it seemed a bit too heavy, but then it absorbed into the skin, I have noticed some improvement with wrinkles under my eyes</li>
      <li>One thing I noticed is how dry my face must have been prior as my face thirsts for the cream and now feels soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>There was a marked improvement in my skin condition almost immediately.</li>
      <li>you can&#x27;t beat all natural without any chemicals.  </li>
      <li>I like the fact that it is all natural because I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>only product that I&#x27;ve found that comes very close to &#x27;curing&#x27; my rosacea.</li>
      <li>and I am amazed so far.  </li>
      <li>OH - and those &#x27;sun spots&#x27; on my face, wrinkles, and &#x27;liver spots&#x27; on the backs of my hands are almost completely gone.</li>
      <li>So far I truly like this product.  </li>
      <li>keeps my skin clear and soft...</li>
      <li>Developed and produced by professionals of the beauty industry supported with lots of clinical trails before launching it.</li>
      <li>Plus it makes my face and neck feel so soft...</li>
      <li>I had combination skin, creamy smooth complexion until I was in my late 40&#x27;s - then had a baby.</li>
      <li>The overall tone has evened out in my complexion and my pores are almost completely invisible.  </li>
      <li>Not only did it break my sensitive skin out in cystic acne, it did not transform my skin into the airbrushed glow of a VS model in the catalog.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this consistently at night for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any results that are noticeable.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love this product.  I like the fact that it is all natural because I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Saw nerium on Facebook tried this product cause it was inexpensive and its a awesome product put it on face at night wake up in morning with Smooth skin</li>
    <li> Purchased this item seeking an alternative to Nerium AD lotion. The results have been absolutely amazing. In less than a week, my pores appear smaller, blemishes are disappearing and skin texture appears smoother. Will definitely continue using this product. Highly recommend this lotion</li>
    <li> I purchased my first jar of Menrva&#x27;s Kiss Shea Nerium Skin Crème on recommendation of a friend. Prior to using Menrva&#x27;s Kiss, I had dry flakey skin on my face, arms, and hands. Whenever I rubbed by face or arms there was a virtual shower of dander that floated to the floor. During my first week of use, I applied Menrva&#x27;s Kiss on a daily basis after my morning shower. There was a marked improvement in my skin condition almost immediately. I now apply Menrva&#x27;s Kiss a couple of times a week to maintain natural healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Menrva&#x27;s Kiss may seem to be a little thick right out of the jar. I apply it to the palms of my hands and then briskly rub them together. This softens the crème so that it can be easily applied. Once applied, the crème dries to a smooth natural look within a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleased with the results of Menrva&#x27;s Kiss that I have purchased it for other friends. I would highly recommend Menrva&#x27;s Kiss Skin Crème for maintenance of natural healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&lt;br /&gt;Prescott, Arizona</li>
    <li> Excellent....I recommend...</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Prior to using Menrva&#x27;s Kiss, my rosacea was at the stage where I had daily outbreaks of small white pustules on my face (can&#x27;t really call them zits; popping them only made them last for weeks instead of days) and TONS of tiny broken blood vessels on my nose and cheeks. I had combination skin, creamy smooth complexion until I was in my late 40&#x27;s - then had a baby. Five years after baby (a year ago), rosacea and terribly dry skin, flaking off all over; wrinkles and &#x27;sun spots&#x27; on my face and &#x27;liver spots&#x27; on the backs of my hands. On a business trip, I encountered a brother/sister team at a convention selling the nerium stuff that costs so much. I don&#x27;t like MLMs but was intrigued about the product, so I went searching and found Menrva&#x27;s Kiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I use it: At bedtime, I wash my face with a clean, warm cloth; pick an aloe leaf from the dozen plants in my kitchen window, thank the plant, then smear the aloe juice on my face; put about 1/4 t. on each cheek, chin, and forehead. By this time, my hands are covered with aloe juice and fingertips have remnants of Menrva&#x27;s Kiss, so I use my fingertips to work the MK into my skin, mixing it with the aloe already on my face. Since my fingertips now have excess aloe/MK, I rub it into the backs of my hands. Using a clean, warm cloth again, I gently wipe my face and hands. There is only a little product left behind, but my face is now silky smooth. My bright red cheeks and nose are almost normal skin color again; this lasts for about 16 hours. If only I remembered to use it every day...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I do use it several days in a row, the bright red is significantly diminished all day and evening. OH - and those &#x27;sun spots&#x27; on my face, wrinkles, and &#x27;liver spots&#x27; on the backs of my hands are almost completely gone. I&#x27;ve only used two jars over the course of a year. The dry skin? Gone. Just gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product that I&#x27;ve found that comes very close to &#x27;curing&#x27; my rosacea.</li>
    <li> altough one must be patient for application...it is rather waxy and cumbersome to apply when cool.warm atmosphere helps if you store in cooler home.but as a man i noticed results after a few days in evening out...sunspots were reduced...</li>
    <li> I love the product itself , and the smooth texture it has when i put in on my face,and the fragrance alone is very nice. thank you so much for a product that i can see myself buying again,</li>
    <li> This product is made of shea butter, coconut oil, and nerium extract. It is very emollient but doesn&#x27;t stay greasy. It absorbs quickly. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it gets really hard when it&#x27;s cold in the house. I use my hair dryer to make it easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this product as an alternative to a much more expensive product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and haven&#x27;t seen dramatic improvement yet, but I&#x27;m still hopeful I will soon.</li>
    <li> at first it seemed a bit too heavy, but then it absorbed into the skin, I have noticed some improvement with wrinkles under my eyes</li>
    <li> I wanted to try Nerium cream but didn&#x27;t like the high prices.  I like this cream because a little goes a long way.  I think my skin looks better since I started using Memra&#x27;s Kiss.</li>
    <li> Love it! It does work. My skin has never look so much better until I tried this cream. The best!</li>
    <li> Just started using so I can&#x27;t tell if it will make the noticeable difference I am hoping for, but once I warm it up in my hands it goes on nicely.  I have been putting it on at night over aloe Vera gel (which is recommended on the product label).</li>
    <li> a bit hard to put on, due to the texture. Need to be warmed up in the palm....otherwise, my skin feels great and looks healthy!</li>
    <li> Very greasy!  If you put this on your feet, make sure you rub it in well before getting between the sheets.  Leaves grease spots.  It does moisturize well.</li>
    <li> Very thick, don&#x27;t like the smell at all, It does moisturize but there are other products out there that are easier to use and smell better..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not able to give an honest review..too early to tell..? But why does it say use with aloe vera..because I don&#x27;t....so does it make it less effective &amp; if so may be reason Inot seeing such a great difference results...or such slow results...I&#x27;d suggest adding aloe vera to your product as I&#x27;ve never ordered a product which required me to purchase another for it to work BETTER</li>
    <li> In the past, I have used shea butter alone, which is moisturizing by itself. I haven&#x27;t seen any new benefits from the nerium.</li>
    <li> bought it for my mom, and she loves it!  you can&#x27;t beat all natural without any chemicals.  i highly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this skin creme!  Due to the rave reviews from a friend about that *other* nerium skin creme, I tried it along with its steep $80 price tag, and was very disappointed.  Not only did it break my sensitive skin out in cystic acne, it did not transform my skin into the airbrushed glow of a VS model in the catalog.  When I saw this, I decided to give it a try because of the simple, organic ingredient list.  I am so glad I ordered it!  It is superbly moisturizing, and has not caused a single blemish to crop up on my face.  My skin looks healthy and glowing, and I will continue to repurchase this as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> This product seemed to be doing a good job, but it hardened after a short time, and is almost impossible to get out of the jar. I can&#x27;t really recommend it because of that.</li>
    <li> This product is so much less expensive than the other products available!!  (They also offer a product that has four times as much nerium (oleander)!!  I feel that it really helps to tighten my skin!!</li>
    <li> Only one reviewer mentions the odor!  You will smell like roasted sunflower seeds.  I cannot use this any closer to my nose than on my elbows.  Seems like a home made concoction.  The consistency is not homogeneous.  I guess I will use it up but it&#x27;s no better than thick store bought creams.</li>
    <li> I order this product because I saw the reviews that some customers where using this product as a replacement of the original Nerium AD night cream, so I want it to check it out! I have use both products (Merva&#x27;s and Nerium AD) and this is my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Menrva&#x27;s Kiss:&lt;br /&gt;Pros. cheap, naturals ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Cons. Greasy, Don&#x27;t absorb very easy on skin, it&#x27;s hard to put it on your skin, the smell is not very pleasant it feels like you just put peanut butter on yourself!. Bottle is not very pretty and it&#x27;s really hard to take the container with you in trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take me wrong here I think the person who makes the cream as a nice idea of combining tree goods ingredients but she needs to work on the product quality, a lot of people live a very fast life you won&#x27;t have the time to warm up the container to make it runny so you can spread it over and also the smell, who wants to smell like peanut butter all day! A 25 dlls the bottle you definitely are getting what you are paying for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nerium AD night/day cream&lt;br /&gt;Pros. This is the first company that started to extract the oleander (also is the only company that has the patent of the extraction, which puts the question mark on Menrva&#x27;s kiss, is it really oleander what it is in the jar or something else?). Developed and produced by professionals of the beauty industry supported with lots of clinical trails before launching it. Really easy to put in your skin, the day cream is my favorite! I can put it as much as I need, and always absorbs and leaves a very clean and smooth sensation without  feeling greasy that I can easily put an spf lotion over it and my make up.&lt;br /&gt;Cons. Higher price, you can only get it trough a brand partner (if you want the real deal!), again you are getting what you are paying for! But for the benefits that your skin will get I don&#x27;t think is a bad price at all!</li>
    <li> Yes.  So far I truly like this product.  I will buy more.  Wish it was a bit easier to apply as I would use it all OVER, especially arms.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrendous. After 5 days of use, I think I see some smoothing of the fine lines but am not sure if I will use the entire bottle due to the smell.</li>
    <li> product is nice after being warmed 20 seconds in microwave to soften consistency -- otherwise it set so hard it&#x27;s not spreadable.  The warmth is actually wonder and has so much shea butter that skin looks and feels great after use.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure that I see the nerium affects, but its a good body moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I received my cream and have been using it for a week and I am amazed so far.  The overall tone has evened out in my complexion and my pores are almost completely invisible.  Dark patches I have had for years are fading.  I have dark circles and bags under my eyes. I see evenness emerging in that area and hopefully with regular use I hope to see marked improvement in that area as well!  This cream is a lifesaver and I hope to use it for the rest of my life. The improvement in my skin is that remarkable.  One thing I noticed is how dry my face must have been prior as my face thirsts for the cream and now feels soft and smooth.  This is a great product I highly recommend and have recommended to some of my friends who have ordered as well because they can see the improvement in my skin even after a week.  I am saving my progress through pictures and will update soon.  Thank you Menrva&#x27;s Kiss. At 45 and being someone who never really took care of their skin, I feel there is hope for my face. Top notch product.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this! Plus it makes my face and neck feel so soft... Unfortunately, something in it is making me breakout :( I had hoped it would help diminish some of my deeper wrinkles.. Guess I&#x27;m back to searching for the &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; wrinkle cure ;)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say much for the smell but it dissipates quickly.  It is helping my face, great moisturizer.  You must put it in your hand to warm it up in order to smooth I on your face as it is truly very thick, but my skin soaks it up within 30 minutes.  I think it probably works as well as that +100.00 Nerium with a much better price tag.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Greasy, thick moisturizer.  Worked well on hands and feet if kept in socks and gloves but didn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream but can only use it at night because even if I only use a tiny bit my skin looks and feels extremely greasy. I have combination/dry skin and usually pile on the normal moisturizers.</li>
    <li> So glad I tried this cream...It is very effectivel...just a few ingredients, but well chosen ones..it does it&#x27;s job with ease...keeps my skin clear and soft...I rub any leftover on my hands which is a great treatment as well...I will continue with Menva&#x27;s Kiss...I am an older person who needs all the help she can get...this really helps... great price too....Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I found it online last February.  After trying it and noticing how hard it was to spread over my face, I bought some Aloe Vera. I put a little Aloe on first leaving a little on my fingers to mix and apply with the Minerva&#x27;s Kiss.  I love the results! I feel as though my face is firmer. I also feel as though my make up (foundation) goes on more evenly.  I love how long this jar has lasted. I will be back for more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this consistently at night for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any results that are noticeable.  It also has a very granular texture which doesn&#x27;t go on your skin smoothly. I wasn&#x27;t exactly expecting that.</li>
    <li> My husband is using this product for his hands and fingers...A good product..</li>
    <li> So far I like the results - my face feels softer &amp; am hoping some small brown spots will clear up over the next few months.  Rubbing between your palms to soften it is the key to spreading it over your watered face.</li>
    <li> This is a great item. Have been telling all my friends about it. It helps with healing cuts and scrapes. Used it on my Mother after she had skin cancer cut out.</li>
    <li> It is very rich but hard to get out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Not very creamy. I feel like it needs to be heated to get it out.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet.</li>
</ol>
