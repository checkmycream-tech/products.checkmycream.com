    <li> The one spray deodorant that KILLS stink and last for even more than a whole day. Only the old fashion roll on white chunky deodorant last longer, but for those that care, it&#x27;s does leave the armpit dinlgeberries(if you get my meaning) so will look like you actually used a roll on deodorant. Speaking as a man this product works great.</li>
    <li> It does the job but what I hadn&#x27;t counted on was the spray out in the room.  One big inhale and coughing sets in.</li>
    <li> I love staying fresh and clean and enjoying a light pleasant fragrance at the same time! This product does it all!</li>
    <li> I paid $5.29 for a four oz. spray can of Suave deodorant from Amazon....My daughter picked up a 6 oz. can of the same item from Target yesterday for $2.69.&lt;br /&gt;For $.09 I could have had another 6 oz. can of this product.</li>
    <li> Very small can - not same size as in the store.</li>
    <li> Not as large as I expected...I will learn to read the description closer next time.</li>
    <li> SO FAR I HAVENT STOUNK UP MY HOME AND MOTHERS ARE NOT PULLLING SMALL CHIDREN FROM MY RANGE OF FRANGRANCE...LOL..PRICE IS RIGHT</li>
    <li> Great product..This works best for me!</li>
    <li> On time ans as described.</li>
    <li> It rubs off more than I thought it would. Its not 24 hour but most  deoderant needs to be reapplied.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I used it when I was in middle school after basketball practice because it smells great and is also really cold when you put it on, which is great after sweating for an hour. After seven years, I have came back to this stuff, using it before and after work outs. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I do not personally use this product but my daughter does.  She has very sensitive skin and normal roll-on deodorants give her a rash.  She has tried various brands including Degree and Secret in a variety of scents and unscented but none of them were good for her skin.  After using this she was ecstatic.  No rash and it smells wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t even have a sensitive skin label on it but it does not contain any ingredients that are harmful to her skin or cause allergic reactions.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Perfect solution since I suffered a major fracture of my left wrist.  I&#x27;ve had to relearn bathing and dressing until I get my range of motion back, using one hand, basically.  This is a good product.  Available in stores too, but just adding it onto other items I was ordering was handy.  The container lasts a long time and has a nice clean powder fragrance.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s wonderfully good! This is the fourth time I&#x27;ve ordered it. I LOVE the spray. It makes me feel good! thank-you. David</li>
    <li> I like the product and would probably purchase it again,</li>
    <li> Had to change my review from five stars (this item had being effective when I stayed home in air-conditioned environment). It is gentle on your skin, but:&lt;br /&gt;1) The powder gets on your clothing, which is annoying especially if you are running late for work.&lt;br /&gt;2) Speaking of work, as a teacher it is embarrassing to have wet spots under your arms. which this deodorant didn&#x27;t prevent and I think encouraged during humid days.&lt;br /&gt;I am trying out clear Fa &amp; Rexona to see which scents I like better, they go on clear (like an 80&#x27;s hairspray)and dry you up. paying for the postage is well worth it for the results, since I dread t spend another minute at work drying my shirt on a hand-dryer.</li>
