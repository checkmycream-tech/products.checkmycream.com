      <li>everything else in kit is ok power supply needs a better cord plug</li>
      <li>I love it and it was delivered in two days</li>
      <li>Better off just remove ink.</li>
      <li>The Tattoo gun is great for a new start</li>
      <li>Very cool design on it though.</li>
      <li>that if someone wants to learn how to tattoo this would be a really good gun to start with</li>
      <li>Cheap cheap cheap</li>
      <li>pay cheap get junk</li>
      <li>Once I tightened screw correctly everything ran smooth.</li>
      <li>Came quickly and everything was fine and unbroken haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
      <li>I only use the gun, power supply, cords, foot pedal, needles, rubber bands, caps, and grommets from this kit I have my own ink and sterile tubes with grips!</li>
      <li>Very good gun bad ink but very good</li>
      <li>I loved the design the only thing</li>
      <li>The other one runs great.</li>
      <li>bought it as a back up to my other equipment, I ran the gun at 9.6 and did a tattoo the same day it arrived, being pretty skeptical, and was really impressed this thing ran flawless so impressed!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it should be!</li>
      <li>Worth the money for the parts if you have another gun (I do)</li>
      <li>OK I&#x27;ve had it for 2month out of the whole kit only machine and power box works ok not reliable but it still.</li>
      <li>just my power supply box burned out in the first 2 minutes of use.</li>
      <li>The dvd came empty but other than that, it was a good kit!</li>
      <li>I would recommend buying some different high quality inks other then that its a great starter kit.</li>

      <li>This product Runs Very well</li>
      <li>Yes very much so thanks</li>
      <li>I really like this gun</li>
      <li>Although I didn&#x27;t remember ordering this its a cute little starter kit.</li>
      <li>it is the tension screw at the top is plastic so as your tattooing it unscrew and releases tension making the needle slow down but other than that the whole set is great</li>
      <li>I use the wiring from this kit for my new kit</li>
      <li>I love this little kit so compact, but I do not use the ink, grip, or metal tubes!</li>
      <li>it was just a complete wreck</li>
      <li>ink unknown name doesn&#x27;t stay ruins skin get\\&quot;intenze\\&quot; ink better</li>
      <li>tattoo gun barely ran for 20 minutes before blowing the fuse power supply went out in the end</li>
      <li>But all the stuff was there, and I think I only gave a few bucks for it, so I still got more than I spent, so I don&#x27;t feel cheated.</li>
      <li>The only thing I have to complain about is how useless the CD rom disc is, but other than that it is a great kit.</li>

    <li> This is a piece of s***. I would highly not recommend buying this. No instructions, power supply didn&#x27;t work. Dvd was just a bunch of pictures. Not worth 1$</li>
    <li> tattoo gun barely ran for 20 minutes before blowing the fuse power supply went out in the end 40 minutes it was just a complete wreck the ink for small they would not stay in skin I do not recommend this for anyone</li>
    <li> I really like this gun everything is going really good i thunk that if someone wants to learn how to tattoo this would be a really good gun to start with</li>

    <li> The Tattoo gun is great for a new start</li>
    <li> Once I tightened screw correctly everything ran smooth.</li>
    <li> The gun was great I loved the design the only thing abt it is the tension screw at the top is plastic so as your tattooing it unscrew and releases tension making the needle slow down but other than that the whole set is great</li>

    <li> The kit is smaller than what I ordered.</li>
    <li> just my power supply box burned out in the first 2 minutes of use.</li>

    <li> Foot pedal broke when i got it.</li>
    <li> Excellent starter kit!!!!! This product Runs Very well so Does the power supply great Deal.</li>
    <li> Good tattoo machines ALONE cost 500+ not to mention gloves, needles, power supply, ink, oh and most importantly AN APPRENTICESHIP! Amazon should remove this piece of crap scratching machine.

I only use the gun, power supply, cords, foot pedal, needles, rubber bands, caps, and grommets from this kit I have my own ink and sterile tubes with grips!</li>
    <li> As expected but I thought it came with a DVD that shows you how to put it together - it was pictures ....</li>

Better off just remove ink.It is Bulls*** ink unknown name doesn&#x27;t stay ruins skin get\\&quot;intenze\\&quot; ink better .if u do the math on buying a$8 maching $7 power suppl .  $3-6needles  it all comes out almost the same as kit advice just but all separate it hard to find.
