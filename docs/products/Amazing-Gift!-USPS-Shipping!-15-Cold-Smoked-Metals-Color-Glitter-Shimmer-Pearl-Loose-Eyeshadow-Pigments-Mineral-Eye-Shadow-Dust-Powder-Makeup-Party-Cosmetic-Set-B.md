      <li>the packaging wasn&#x27;t amazing</li>
      <li>Love the colors wish I had the gold in glitter</li>
      <li>ladies please please please make sure that you use a primer of some sort before applying.</li>
      <li>The colors are bright and vivid, and they stay nicely.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love these and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>they didnt last all day like some eye shadows but its great.</li>
      <li>I bought these for around $7.00 and figured if they werent great, it wouldnt be a big loss.</li>
      <li>this really helped the color stay for about 7 hrs!!!</li>
      <li>had to clean them all so the powder didn&#x27;t get on my fingers every time I picked one</li>
      <li>Surprisingly these shades are fantastic especially for the price.</li>
      <li>I like the quality of the product, shipment was so fast and free , now this is a deal!</li>
      <li>so so pleased i really was.</li>
      <li>had originally gotten a set like this for my little cousin, and after hearing great things from her-</li>
      <li>bought a cheap eye shadow primer from the dollar store to apply first.</li>
      <li>Be sure to use a brush for application to avoid excess caking, as the colors are really vivid.</li>
      <li>really enjoy this product and recommend it highly!</li>
      <li>But most of the colors, aren&#x27;t really eye shadow, it&#x27;s straight glitter.</li>
      <li>but overall the colors are really nice.</li>
      <li>This item came right on time and there are all of the colours described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Received only two duplicates wich is fine!</li>
      <li>Better than expected and was right on time!</li>
      <li>Pretty  colors got the colors in the picture  </li>
      <li>make sure to get some elf sparkle eye shadow primer so that the colour and sparkle actually sticks to your lids.</li>
      <li>The colors are very pigmented and I feel that they would give Younqiue eye pigments a run for their money!</li>
      <li>The glitter ones are REALLY glittery and fun for night time.</li>
      <li>Lots of color, I mixed with a little mixing medium and it turns them into a metallic bright eyeliner!</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d repurchase  fast  shipping  as well</li>
      <li>I actually really like them.</li>
      <li>Mine came with 2 of the same browns and the white glitter had been mixed with some of the purple glitter.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging wasn&#x27;t that good.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend you trying these.</li>
      <li>nice  lil messy but filled  to the rim to be so dang small</li>
      <li>I just love them all but they are too small in the containers</li>
      <li>the Primer will help with the pigmentation which by the way is already pretty by itself, as well as help the  shadow last longer throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Extremely vivid pigmented colors.</li>
      <li>one was slightly  open  and spilled  but not a lot very  pigmented  </li>
      <li>I could not love these pigments any more than I currently do!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more difficult to get the vibrant and vivid colours to show up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I just got mine in today and they were on time actually a day early so that  is a plus... anyhooo ...</li>
      <li>: use a little water on your brush to REALLY make these colors pop!</li>

<li> I do have a little color fall onto my cheeks during application</li>
<li> Way brighter in person and a little to wild/bold for my taste.</li>
<li> And a lot of the colors are just not great for everyday wear.</li>

    <li> I bought these for around $7.00 and figured if they werent great, it wouldnt be a big loss. I actually really like them. Be sure to use a brush for application to avoid excess caking, as the colors are really vivid. I use this with an eyeliner brush and just put them at my lash line. The containers that are actual glitter will require an adhesive. All in all, I like them a lot!</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price. I would buy again! Love the colors wish I had the gold in glitter</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Extremely vivid pigmented colors. I am very impressed and pleased with my order.</li>
    <li> I like the quality of the product, shipment was so fast and free , now this is a deal!</li>
    <li> Perfect if you want to change things up a bit! Received only two duplicates wich is fine! Better than expected and was right on time!</li>
    <li> The product is not bad, just a little messy to apply. And a lot of the colors are just not great for everyday wear. Way brighter in person and a little to wild/bold for my taste.</li>
    <li> Mine came with 2 of the same browns and the white glitter had been mixed with some of the purple glitter.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging wasn&#x27;t that good. When I opened it, it seemed to have spilled some of the colors (not a bunch though).&lt;br /&gt;I had to clean them all so the powder didn&#x27;t get on my fingers every time I picked one up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just a bit upset about the white glitter getting mixed with the purple glitter, but overall the colors are really nice.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly these shades are fantastic especially for the price. The glitter ones are REALLY glittery and fun for night time. I use the shimmer ones for daily use. I highly recommend you trying these.</li>
    <li> I like this product. some of them were glitter and didn&#x27;t need them. The colors they sent me were great. they didnt last all day like some eye shadows but its great. bought a cheap eye shadow primer from the dollar store to apply first. this really helped the color stay for about 7 hrs!!! i would order more from them or give as a gift!</li>

    <li> Pretty  colors got the colors in the picture  one was slightly  open  and spilled  but not a lot very  pigmented  n nice  lil messy but filled  to the rim to be so dang small I&#x27;d repurchase  fast  shipping  as well</li>
    <li> I LOOOOOVE these! I was scared to order them, a lot of reviews said they received one&#x27;s mixed, or opened. Mine came within a week, in perfect condition! Great deal for a great price!&lt;br /&gt;Tip: use a little water on your brush to REALLY make these colors pop!</li>
    <li> This item came right on time and there are all of the colours described.&lt;br /&gt;I had originally gotten a set like this for my little cousin, and after hearing great things from her- I decided to get some myself.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure to get some elf sparkle eye shadow primer so that the colour and sparkle actually sticks to your lids. If you dont have any type of primer- it&#x27;s more difficult to get the vibrant and vivid colours to show up.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy this product and recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Came just like itis in the pic. Awesome colors.</li>
    <li> I just love them all but they are too small in the containers looked very lovely every one loved it</li>
    <li> The colors are bright and vivid, and they stay nicely. But most of the colors, aren&#x27;t really eye shadow, it&#x27;s straight glitter. Kind of a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I could not love these pigments any more than I currently do! The colors are very pigmented and I feel that they would give Younqiue eye pigments a run for their money! I do recommend using a primer, I use ELF primer and these colors last all day. I do have a little color fall onto my cheeks during application but I don&#x27;t know of an eyeshadow/pigment that does not do that. I love, love, love these and highly recommend! Peace.</li>
    <li> I just got mine in today and they were on time actually a day early so that  is a plus... anyhooo ... the packaging wasn&#x27;t amazing but my shadows&lt;br /&gt;were all in tact.. none were spilled and they were all the colors that were pictured above. The colors are completely amazing and beautiful&lt;br /&gt;and ladies please please please make sure that you use a primer of some sort before applying. the Primer will help with the pigmentation which by the way is already pretty by itself, as well as help the  shadow last longer throughout the day. Over all for $7.99 and no shipping fee i was&lt;br /&gt;so so so pleased i really was. I would buy this product again. Very inexpensive and i don&#x27;t feel jipped. So go ahead and add it to your cart.</li>
