### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Customer service was great too!</li>
      <li>Freaking awesome!</li>
      <li>Really great!!</li>
      <li>I am happy for it, prise is very nice, also smell</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve done a good job.</li>
      <li>I had Fahrenheit and girls loved the smell as did</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
      <li>More I use it the more</li>
      <li>outstanding and for the price</li>
      <li>This is very similar, as I cannot tell the difference and the price is the best offer you can get.</li>
      <li>This makes for an excellent daily cologne, and you just can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>and I will probably order more just based on the price point.  </li>
      <li>If you love Fahrenheit buy this now.  </li>
      <li>Realy good, but not fahrenheit, it is firenight, smell is very close to fahreinheit.</li>
      <li>Smells like the real thing!!!</li>
      <li>I have been using original FAHRENHEIT for over 15 years.  </li>
      <li>Smells exactly the the original, maybe even better.</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for but is better than paying through the nose for the real stuff.</li>
      <li>Not a bad knock-off.</li>
      <li>Only drawback to this &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; is that the sillage and longevity are moderate at best.</li>
      <li>I like the fact that right on the box they do not claim to be the original stuff</li>
      <li>Try it, $15.00 is worth the risk</li>
      <li>Very close to the original (1988)</li>
      <li>You JUST can&#x27;t beat the price and FOR ME it gets really close to the original fragrance.</li>
      <li>Firenight is very close and since it is so cheap I can wear it as much as I want.  </li>
      <li>Long lasting great smelling</li>
      <li>First time I&#x27;ve used item</li>
      <li>When I first spray it on my skin</li>
      <li>If you really like the original stuff but can&#x27;t afford it or if you need to have the original fragrance handy in a glove compartment or back pack while going on a hike or a long trip, this is the one you want to have with you.</li>
      <li>Now to be honest,, I&#x27;m not a heavy cologne guy, but when I was younger</li>
      <li>Regardless, the bottle that was shipped to me is a very close match to the real thing.</li>
      <li>If you really want Fahrenheit, you&#x27;ll just have to buy Fahrenheit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked and have come to the conclusion that if you are looking for a deal on an imitation, you will not find anything better than this deal.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really not a bad scent, but only lasts about an hour to two hours even with four to five sprays.</li>
      <li>It has a decent smell, somewhat close to Fahrenheit</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re in a pinch and want to smell decent for an hour or two, try this stuff out.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s WAY better than those little bottles of oil that aren&#x27;t even close.</li>
      <li>Smells pretty similar to the original, not exact, but pretty close.</li>
      <li>The scent does not last for the whole day or any thing like that but for the price I&#x27;d spray this stuff on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Very pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Smells very close to the original,Although not exactly.</li>

<li> Smells very close to the original,Although not exactly.</li>
<li> Not sure why people are complaining; may make sense if this company has had quality variance with certain batches.</li>
<li> /&gt;Firenight actually smells like a long lost cousin of Fahrenheit.</li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
<li> Fahrenheit scent which unfortunately has undergone 4 reformulations over the past 25 years partly to do with allergic reactions of some individuals and partly to do with trying to maintain a &#x27;fresh&#x27; and current appeal to both existing and new consumers  ....  </li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t purchase imitation colognes, but Fahrenheit has always been a bit more on the expensive side (compared to say, a similar size bottle of Drakkar or Coolwater),</li>
<li> CAREFULLY ITS NOT THE RESL THING</li>
<li> it you can tell it is different but after a few minutes it smells almost identical.  </li>
<li> keep it in my back pack and rub on a little here and a little there.</li>
<li> It has never gone down in price and you&#x27;ll never see it lying at the bottom of WAl</li>
<li> &quot; on the little bottle.  </li>
<li> One bottle usually last me a year because it is expensive</li>
<li> Firenight Cologne has an identical aroma (at least on my skin) as Farenheit at about 60% to 70% savings.  </li>
<li> Again, it&#x27;s really not that bad</li>
<li> you just can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
<li> ITS FAKEA BOOT LEG STINKS READ THE AD</li>
<li> This fragrance for me is bad.</li>
<li> DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s a crap shoot as to whether or not it will smell like candy or grandma&#x27;s Lysol-jacked bathroom - not even attempting to be close to Fahrenheit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> being said, Firenight isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>

    <li> If you really like the original stuff but can&#x27;t afford it or if you need to have the original fragrance handy in a glove compartment or back pack while going on a hike or a long trip, this is the one you want to have with you. You JUST can&#x27;t beat the price and FOR ME it gets really close to the original fragrance. The scent does not last for the whole day or any thing like that but for the price I&#x27;d spray this stuff on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in my back pack and rub on a little here and a little there. I like the fact that right on the box they do not claim to be the original stuff (See Pics)</li>
    <li> Very close to the original (1988) Fahrenheit scent which unfortunately has undergone 4 reformulations over the past 25 years partly to do with allergic reactions of some individuals and partly to do with trying to maintain a &#x27;fresh&#x27; and current appeal to both existing and new consumers  ....  Only drawback to this &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; is that the sillage and longevity are moderate at best.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t even close to the sense of Farenheight.</li>
    <li> Really great!! Bought it as a gift!</li>
    <li> Now this cologne smells just like Fahrenheit. I&#x27;m very satisfied. I&#x27;ll be ordering this again.Customer service was great too!</li>
    <li> Long lasting great smelling</li>
    <li> More I use it the more I like- First time I&#x27;ve used item</li>
    <li> Smells like the real thing!!! YEEAAAA</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP ITS FAKEA BOOT LEG STINKS READ THE AD CAREFULLY ITS NOT THE RESL THING ITS A KNOCK OFF. SAVE UR MONEY WISH I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK</li>
    <li> Fahrenheit cologne has been out since 1988. It has never gone down in price and you&#x27;ll never see it lying at the bottom of WAl-Mart clearance rack for one reason; it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, Firenight isn&#x27;t terrible. It&#x27;s WAY better than those little bottles of oil that aren&#x27;t even close. You know, it says \\&quot;Versace\\&quot; on the little bottle.  Then, you get it and it&#x27;s a crap shoot as to whether or not it will smell like candy or grandma&#x27;s Lysol-jacked bathroom - not even attempting to be close to Fahrenheit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firenight actually smells like a long lost cousin of Fahrenheit. It&#x27;s really not a bad scent, but only lasts about an hour to two hours even with four to five sprays. If you&#x27;re in a pinch and want to smell decent for an hour or two, try this stuff out.  Again, it&#x27;s really not that bad and I will probably order more just based on the price point.  I have Fahrenheit and basically use Firenight as another cologne, not a replacement.  If you really want Fahrenheit, you&#x27;ll just have to buy Fahrenheit. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Smells very close to the original,Although not exactly.A bargain compared to the actual brand.</li>
    <li> This fragrance for me is bad.</li>
    <li> Firenight Cologne has an identical aroma (at least on my skin) as Farenheit at about 60% to 70% savings.  Try it, $15.00 is worth the risk is you&#x27;re on a budget like myself.</li>
    <li> It has a decent smell, somewhat close to Fahrenheit but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  You get what you pay for but is better than paying through the nose for the real stuff.</li>
    <li> Now to be honest,, I&#x27;m not a heavy cologne guy, but when I was younger I had Fahrenheit and girls loved the smell as did I. This is very similar, as I cannot tell the difference and the price is the best offer you can get. I&#x27;ve looked and have come to the conclusion that if you are looking for a deal on an imitation, you will not find anything better than this deal.</li>
    <li> outstanding and for the price</li>
    <li> Not sure why people are complaining; may make sense if this company has had quality variance with certain batches. Regardless, the bottle that was shipped to me is a very close match to the real thing. I usually don&#x27;t purchase imitation colognes, but Fahrenheit has always been a bit more on the expensive side (compared to say, a similar size bottle of Drakkar or Coolwater), so I wasn&#x27;t going to fret about about $12 shipped to my door for Firenight. Very pleasantly surprised. They&#x27;ve done a good job. This makes for an excellent daily cologne, and you just can&#x27;t beat the price. Give it a shot; $12 isn&#x27;t that big of a gamble.</li>
    <li> Not a bad knock-off. Smells pretty similar to the original, not exact, but pretty close. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Realy good, but not fahrenheit, it is firenight, smell is very close to fahreinheit. I am happy for it, prise is very nice, also smell is like a fahrenheit.</li>
    <li> Freaking awesome! Smells exactly the the original, maybe even better. At a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> I have been using original FAHRENHEIT for over 15 years.  One bottle usually last me a year because it is expensive but I don&#x27;t get to wear it as often as I would like.  Firenight is very close and since it is so cheap I can wear it as much as I want.  When I first spray it on my skin it you can tell it is different but after a few minutes it smells almost identical.  My wife could not tell the difference.  Is it Fahrenheit?  No! But it is so close and so affordable you just can&#x27;t go wrong.  So it gets a solid 5 stars from me.  If you love Fahrenheit buy this now.  Hell get 2 bottles.</li>
