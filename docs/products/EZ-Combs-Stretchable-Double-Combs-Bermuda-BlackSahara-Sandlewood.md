      <li>I love these hair combs.</li>
      <li>Since I wear them all the time they&#x27;re coming to the end of just how many times I can tighten them so while looking around I found these, now yes they&#x27;re a lot cheaper</li>
      <li>but I figured they&#x27;d be ok to wear around the house</li>
      <li>When it came time to replace them I was pleased to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The girls don&#x27;t like them, but i think they are fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love these combs.  </li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive scalp and they are perfect, and pretty!</li>
      <li>They are easy to use and love how many hair styles I can create them.</li>
      <li>These Combes stay in pretty good.</li>
      <li>These are medium sized combs, with pretty good elastic.  </li>
      <li>These are cute, but they damage/break easily.</li>
      <li>good quality, attractive, brown and black.</li>
      <li>amazing deal right?  </li>
      <li>or it would lose its grip and slide off easily.</li>
      <li>I have finely textured hair, chin length and these combs</li>
      <li>I have super healthy and smooth hair...</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold my hair up that well---somewhat cheaply made.</li>
      <li>not so great for short lengths.</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re so comfortable.</li>
      <li>These would work well for thicker hair and definitely would be great for curly/wavy hair.</li>
      <li>(just so you know I am under my son&#x27;s name so I am actually a female lol)  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed these very much.</li>
      <li>first time I used it stayed OK.  </li>
      <li>the second time, my hair kept sliding out of it no matter what I tried or how I put my hair, on top of that the hair does not stay nice and smooth</li>
      <li>Still, I would be happy to pay a little more to get better quality that didn&#x27;t break so fast.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use and pretty in your hair.</li>
      <li>They came quickly and were just what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Quickly shipped.</li>
      <li>Received quickly and was amazed at how well they work.  </li>
      <li>My girls are used to a tighter pull that i cannot tolerate, and since they have much thicker hair, didn&#x27;t have much luck with this kind of product.</li>
      <li>But it is very pretty in my hair.</li>
      <li>This would be better for special occasions not everyday use.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and bone straight.</li>
      <li>Wife really likes these hair combs, with her fine hair they hold it in place and doesn&#x27;t tangle into the hair.</li>
      <li>Its worth the money</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;ve been worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Very cute and stay nicely with thick, curly hair!</li>
      <li>Not a lot I can say about them other than the fact they&#x27;re easy to use, pretty, profession AND fun, and very very good for preventing strain on long hair.  </li>
      <li>These worked well when I wore my hair curly but slid right out if I&#x27;d straightened it.</li>
      <li>As a result, they slide right out of your hair.</li>
      <li>I have very straight, shoulder-length hair and it slides right out after a couple of hours.</li>
      <li>Holds even fine soft hair without falling out.</li>
      <li>They shipped fast and would buy from Telebrands again!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only worn one once, but I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase so far.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>

      <li>There are similar products out there that seem to do a better job than this brand.  </li>
      <li>They are pretty though.</li>
      <li>but at least the one from Walmart is still in great shape, I guess u get what u pay for...</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s my hair type exactly.</li>
      <li>It provides me with quick and easy hairstyles for my long hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to get my hair into \\&quot;simple\\&quot; styles with simple hair accessories like scrunches and hair ties but this comb thing is perfect!</li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t remember exactly how much they cost</li>
      <li>First of all, the combs are much shorter and don&#x27;t grab as well.</li>
      <li>I am delighted with these combs HOWEVER Amazon lists them as \\&quot;black\\&quot; when in true only one is black.</li>
      <li>Get a little creative!</li>
      <li>Looked easy enough, well</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and am ordering from Amazon as I paid double from the manufacturor.  </li>
      <li>Very flimsy combs that do not hold the hair.  </li>
      <li>I found their website and you can order tighter combs for straight or shorter hair.     </li>
      <li>I really like them, every once and awhile they snap; but all rubber bands do eventually.  </li>
      <li>but I would imagine if you&#x27;re hair&#x27;s much thicker than mine it could be a problem.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have fine hair and am ordering from Amazon as I paid double from the manufacturor.  I wear one everyday! Have done so for 11 months!  I have no doubt they will last much longer.  Yes, the teeth are flexible but that seems to be how they work... just hold them firmly and give the bend you want or bring all teeth back into alignment.  You cannot miss with these and you will not believe the compliments.  (There is a bigger comb for heavy hair.)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  A total waste of money.  The combs would not stay in her hair.  The instructions say to not be afraid to stretch the combs, well I did that.  The band broke and there were beads everywhere.  Horrible product!  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with these combs HOWEVER Amazon lists them as \\&quot;black\\&quot; when in true only one is black. The other is a ceramic beige. Both colors should be listed in the description because it makes the customer think it is two black combs even tho the picture doesn&#x27;t show it. When I orginally ordered there was not a large picture of the procduct and I could not see the colors.</li>
    <li> (just so you know I am under my son&#x27;s name so I am actually a female lol)  I bought these probably a year or so ago.  I am always looking for something for my hair.  Looked easy enough, well first time I used it stayed OK.  the second time, my hair kept sliding out of it no matter what I tried or how I put my hair, on top of that the hair does not stay nice and smooth you got lumps of hair sticking up.  One of them broke, a couple of the elastic parts, within the first few times of trying it.    The \\&quot;comb\\&quot; part of both of them bent out of shape very easy, so they are now all out of wack and useless.  I think the comb part should be made of a sturdier plastic not a extremely cheap bendable one.  I would pass on this product it&#x27;s terrible</li>
    <li> It really is \\&quot;E-Z\\&quot;! My doctor saw mine &amp; she became jealous! Love the variety of colors! I think I&#x27;ll give her one for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I love these hair combs. The only downside is the comb part starts to bend and doesn&#x27;t work as well. So, it won&#x27;t last forever.</li>
    <li> Great product and pretty. Holds even fine soft hair without falling out. It works with heavy hair and fine. That&#x27;s a real plus when you have to deal with both. Just snap it on and off ya go!</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase. Quickly shipped. Excellent product!!!!</li>
    <li> These are ok--I have another one bought elsewhere that is quite sturdy and holds my hair very securely.  These are not as substantial.</li>
    <li> I love them.  They are easy to use with my long hair.</li>
    <li> great colors and look nice in hair</li>
    <li> These are cute, but they damage/break easily. Luckily they are inexpensive enough to just buy several sets. Still, I would be happy to pay a little more to get better quality that didn&#x27;t break so fast.</li>
    <li> These worked well when I wore my hair curly but slid right out if I&#x27;d straightened it. Very cute and stay nicely with thick, curly hair!</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t as tight as other ones I have.  I have to adjust them throughout the day. They are pretty though.</li>
    <li> These combs are much less expensive than Hairzing and seem to be better made. I&#x27;ve only worn one once, but I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase so far.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!!!!! Would not work on my hair or my daughters!!!</li>
    <li> Very flimsy combs that do not hold the hair.  As a result, they slide right out of your hair.</li>
    <li> Received quickly and was amazed at how well they work.  I have thin, fine hair and it stays in just fine.  Was skeptical after the other posts.  Will order more colors.</li>
    <li> The comb parts do seem a bit weak but it seems that they are supposed to be very flexible.  For thick or lots of hair, it&#x27;s better to try one size bigger.  It came with a little guide but they also have video instruction on their web.</li>
    <li> does not hold well the fastener is too wide</li>
    <li> Stretched out within first day of use....don&#x27;t but, seems an off chute of the $6 just for one from Walmart....but at least the one from Walmart is still in great shape, I guess u get what u pay for...</li>
    <li> I like this. Holds my hair good.Dd not come with the instructions as stated. Carton was tore open. Thought it came with two of each Colorado. It does not.</li>
    <li> I have used combs like these for years. When it came time to replace them I was pleased to find them on Amazon. I have finely textured hair, chin length and these combs give me the versatility to change my hairdo and know that the style will hold.</li>
    <li> I got these at a discount store for only $7!  WOW amazing deal right?  Well you get what you pay for.  They seemed to hold up at first, but then the beads became loose.  It did hold my hair... for a while, but not as well as I expected it to.  There are similar products out there that seem to do a better job than this brand.  If you search for Korean hair combs on Youtube there are great shots of how to style your hair... if it&#x27;s long.  not so great for short lengths.</li>
    <li> Better orice than in the stores...good quality, attractive, brown and black. Instructions for other options included. Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> my hair is so thick, its like horse hair, although very pretty and full bodied I have a problem getting clips to work at holding my hair in. This failed as well, it holds it for a few hours then falls away.</li>
    <li> I bought mine years ago and never used them, but I also had some other hair clips that were supposed to pull my hair back, but they wouldn&#x27;t stay in place. Sooo.....I used one, holding it after I put it in my hair and then placed one of the EZcombs over the part which is supposed to interlock. Wow!! That worked great!!! Get a little creative! I think these are great!</li>
    <li> The dang thing couldn&#x27;t even hold my hair for 5 mins... I have super healthy and smooth hair... I guess it can holy hold someone who has rusty grassy hair... :( or someone who doesn&#x27;t move at all...</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> These are medium sized combs, with pretty good elastic.  However, they do NOT stay in my hair well.  I tried bending them more into shape, but because I have very thick, long hair they slide out after a while.  Now that isn&#x27;t to say I don&#x27;t use them, but I personally prefer the HairZing brand of comb.  Those combs come in a larger size, which works much better for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually gave some of the combs to another friend - and she also had the same problem (her hair is long too - but straight).</li>
    <li> So far so good. My hair is fine and bone straight. These Combes stay in pretty good. They are easy to use and pretty in your hair. I was complemented today in fact.</li>
    <li> These combs are too small and the shipping took too long. I have long thick hair and these combs needed to be larger.</li>
    <li> I borrowed my moms clips just to try one day and ended up getting hooked myself. My black comb broke and the beads went everywhere, but I still like them. I wouldn&#x27;t mind having more colors.</li>
    <li> love them, my hair is very thick &amp; coarse, it works w/ my kind of hair, do like them alot</li>
    <li> I bought these for my teens as stocking stuffers. They all ended up in MY hair basket. The girls don&#x27;t like them, but i think they are fantastic! They keep your hair out of your face but don&#x27;t pull until it hurts. I have a very sensitive scalp and they are perfect, and pretty! My girls are used to a tighter pull that i cannot tolerate, and since they have much thicker hair, didn&#x27;t have much luck with this kind of product.</li>
    <li> I love these combs.  They are easy to use and love how many hair styles I can create them.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed in these combs.    About a year ago, I bought a different brand of this same type of product and I love them. I can sleep in them and, the best part, is that they don&#x27;t push my head forward when I&#x27;m sitting in the car or a recliner like a bun or a ponytail does. They never let go and they&#x27;re so comfortable. I can even reach under the comb and scratch my head without losing any hair.    But these... First of all, the combs are much shorter and don&#x27;t grab as well. But the worst part is the elastic. It&#x27;s just weak.    I have very straight, shoulder-length hair and it slides right out after a couple of hours. The other brand held all day.    These would work well for thicker hair and definitely would be great for curly/wavy hair. Long hair that fills out the weak elastic better might help, as well.    The other contrast is found in the metal teeth. It is the same gauge of wire, but the loop of EZ Comb&#x27;s teeth are significantly wider.     These are not even close to the quality of the other brand and I&#x27;m very disappointed.    UPDATE    I did finally break out the magnifying glass and managed to read the tiny brand tag on my good old standbys. The other brand is hairzing. It&#x27;s *much* better quality than EZ Comb. I found their website and you can order tighter combs for straight or shorter hair.     As I said, I&#x27;ve had my old combs for quite awhile and I use them often. I just played with the EZ Comb and gave it ten quick tugs and I can already feel a loss of elasticity.    hairzing costs a little more, but at least it works and I know they&#x27;ll last.</li>
    <li> Love these! So handy &amp; get compliments all the time even when my hair is actually a mess!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
    <li> This product did not hold my hair. The combs themselves bent quickly, they did not last long. It worked fine for the first use but after a few uses, they are all bent and no longer held my hair. This would be better for special occasions not everyday use.</li>
    <li> Yo!! To start off I gotta mention my hair type. I&#x27;m Puerto Rican and African American with natural/virgin hair so that means my hair is very thick and curly. It&#x27;s hard to get my hair into \\&quot;simple\\&quot; styles with simple hair accessories like scrunches and hair ties but this comb thing is perfect! It takes me a minute to pull all my hair back and usually once I put a scrunchie or hair tie on it the hair would expand and send the hair tie flying or it would lose its grip and slide off easily. With this comb set I can keep my hair back and it stays back for as long as I want. I even went to the pool and it kept my hair back the whole time I was in the water!! Now, since my hair is so strong and thick I break these things easily or I actually stretch them out easily. My hair puts alot of tension on this thing so after about ten or so uses the bands that hold the two combs together pops and the little beads and such go everywhere. If your wondering what kind of hair could do this imagine a Afro being squeezed into this thing. That&#x27;s my hair type exactly. Lol. Now, I was amazed when it held my hair in place while I was swimming so this thing is very strong indeed, don&#x27;t get me wrong. Lol. Its worth the money and I love that it gives you two different colors too.</li>
    <li> I wear these often, mostly the black one because I can wear it in uniform.  I really like them, every once and awhile they snap; but all rubber bands do eventually.  I like these, they last a long time; and they keep my thick hair up and off my collar.</li>
    <li> these work well and were a great bargain.  few things stay in my hair, but these definitely do and without giving me a headache.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS....BREAKS AFTER A COUPLE USES.  I bought this thinking that it would work.  I don&#x27;t have crazy hair and this product should have worked.  But after using the user guide to try different styles, the ends of the elastic bands (where they attach to the combs) were either coming off or already off and some were unraveling.  Super waste of money.</li>
    <li> Has sharp ends that can cut you or damage you hair.</li>
    <li> Love these combs. It provides me with quick and easy hairstyles for my long hair.</li>
    <li> Not a lot I can say about them other than the fact they&#x27;re easy to use, pretty, profession AND fun, and very very good for preventing strain on long hair.  Great product, will continue to buy for years more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because I have tried the Scruncii Upzing combs and love them.  The EZ Combs are much tighter (limited stretch) which is problematic with my thick hair.  In addition, after about 3 attempts to put the comb in my hair, I noticed that the black paint on the comb had almost completely worn off (undoubtedly somewhere in my hair).  I am quite dissatisfied with this product and will not repurchase.  I&#x27;ll stick with the more expensive Upzing combs which retain their color and offer more stretch.</li>
    <li> These combs stay in my thin hair very nicely and are easier on my scalp than elastics</li>
    <li> I had bought the HairZing brand version of this, which worked great.  These have much shorter combs, and in my hair, which is thick, it just didn&#x27;t grab and hold on.  I couldn&#x27;t get it to hold tight at all, I am getting rid of them and buying the brand I know works.</li>
    <li> Combs are beautiful, but I have trouble keeping them locked in place because the band part is somewhat loose for my (thin) hair.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed these very much. They were easy to use and looked quite nice. I ordered several and gave some for gifts.</li>
    <li> Do not like it . Do not stay in my hair and one broke the rubber broke. Waist of monies</li>
    <li> My daughter bought me a comb of this style years ago and I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to get round to wearing it but once I did I just loved it. I bought two from Claire&#x27;s a couple of years ago and they&#x27;ve been fantastic, really strong thick clips with plain black thick elastic, I can&#x27;t remember exactly how much they cost but they&#x27;ve been worth every penny. Since I wear them all the time they&#x27;re coming to the end of just how many times I can tighten them so while looking around I found these, now yes they&#x27;re a lot cheaper but I figured they&#x27;d be ok to wear around the house and I&#x27;d save my other ones for when I&#x27;m out. These are flimsier than I imagined they would be, instead of having actual combs they have metal bent into loops. Now I have very fine hair so these combs actually do work for me but I would imagine if you&#x27;re hair&#x27;s much thicker than mine it could be a problem. The elastic is also very thin so I&#x27;m not sure just how long these will last and with the beads it will be messy when they break.&lt;br /&gt;This is a case of you get what you pay for it seems like a good deal but I&#x27;m not really sure it is as they&#x27;re very bendy and flimsy.</li>
    <li> not easy to use..would not recommend</li>
    <li> These combs were a very good price and exactly as described.  In fact I wear them in my hair just like the picture.  They shipped fast and would buy from Telebrands again!</li>
    <li> Wife really likes these hair combs, with her fine hair they hold it in place and doesn&#x27;t tangle into the hair.</li>
    <li> This clip has been helpful and effective.  It fits nice into my dress code as it works both casually and for formal occasions.</li>
    <li> I had these before but after a few years, the elastic started breaking. I tried to find them in stores but they were all out. They came quickly and were just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Not real happy with this.  Doesn&#x27;t want to stay in place. I do have vey thick hair so I thought it would work great but that is not the case. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Seems to slide to one side or the other.  But it is very pretty in my hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold my hair up that well---somewhat cheaply made.</li>
