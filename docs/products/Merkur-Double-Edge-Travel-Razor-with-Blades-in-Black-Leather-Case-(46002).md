<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a fairly aggressive razor, but it is awesome once you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Tried to like this but it was very hard to be precise owing to the large head. It was almost impossible to get a clean shave under the nose. Like driving a 1976 Cadillac Fleetwood - does well on the straight highways and looks pretty. Many complained about the grip and weight - neither was a problem for me.</li>
    <li> heavy&lt;br /&gt;full of body&lt;br /&gt;takes time to get used to it and finding the right number of closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;never shaved this close before.&lt;br /&gt;the box it came in was ancient. looked like someone ordered the packages for next 30 years back in 1980.</li>
    <li> Quick ship and great price! Love this razor...it&#x27;s changed my mind on de razors!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been trying to transition to this razor for several months now and still can&#x27;t use it with out cutting my face. the newer 4 blade disposable systems do work better. I know using this style of shaver is fun and sleek looking, that&#x27;s why I switched. I&#x27;m ready to switch back to the newer and more advanced type, eg.... gillette fusion. isn&#x27;t technology great?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different brand razors too including the Feather.</li>
    <li> This is the closest shave I have ever had. About 100 times better than that fancy Gillette stuff. Only thing is is that it doesn&#x27;t work well with acne, but what razor does? This is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold. It also comes with 1 razor blade. The quality is superb. Would buy a million times over.</li>
    <li> Keeping my Gillette just to remind me how much money I was blowing on cartridges.  This Merkur is the business!!!</li>
    <li> Best razor I have used so far. The weight and design are perfect. Shaves as well as it looks!!!</li>
    <li> it leaves a lot of blade exposed.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of Merkur&#x27;s customer service or warranty bait and switch tactics (my previous non-adjustable Merkur broke)... However, this adjustable razor truly is nice. We&#x27;ll see how it holds up long term, but I&#x27;m very impressed with it after a month of 3x weekly usage.</li>
    <li> The razor feels hefty and well made, but for the price, a chunk of chrome plating on the inside of the mechanism that holds the blade in place should not fall off as I open the razor for the first time.  It&#x27;s not visible when the razor is assembled, and does not appear to affect the function of the device, so it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of returning it, but the defect should have easily been caught by even a cursory quality control inspection.  Other than that, I like the way the mechanism adjusts and the simple, clean lines of the piece.  The adjustable blade angle is a plus. It&#x27;s just disappointing to buy the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; and then to be greeted by a glaring defect that should never have left the factory.  My next razor will be a different brand, but this one does the job. I had, however, expected more from Merkur.</li>
    <li> I sold my cobra classic razor to get this and a large silver tip badger brush. I won&#x27;t be looking back. This razor has given me the closet shave ive ever had. It is heavy and has great balance. The fact that it has an adjustable head to change the aggressiveness of the shave is great. I like to use the level 5 for my first shave and then level 4 since there won&#x27;t be any friction from hair. I was going to buy a very expensive Above the Tie Cronos razor because i tend to buy expensive stuff lol. But i won&#x27;t be changing my razor after this purchase.</li>
    <li> This razor is extremely well built and has an innovative blade mount mechanism. I give it only 3 stars because it is pretty heavy and gives you little feedback when shaving. People with sensitive skin and &amp;#34;sharp curved&amp;#34; faces will hate it. The larger than usual gap between the blade and  the mounting jaw doesn&#x27;t help either.</li>
    <li> Kudos to the gang that reviewed this razor! I got exactly what I expected although I&#x27;m a bit mystified about the comments of this not being a beginner&#x27;s razor. I learned how to shave with this technology and I would argue that the mass merchandise junk sold today is not a beginner&#x27;s razor&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Once I took the first pull against my beard, it felt great and I can hear each whisker being cleanly cut off. I have very sensitive skin and the blade just glides effortlessly. I admit the razor is heavier than I expected but got the hang of it halfway through. I started on setting four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to the guys who took the time to research and post useful reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor, especially if you want to spend a few extra minutes and reward yourself with an exceptional shave.</li>
    <li> Ive had this razor for a while now only to discover that it is made of pot metal. Zinc pot metal to be exact, will never buy another Merkur product. Company says its fair wear and tear.</li>
    <li> This razor is excellent. Having a razor that can adjust is a major advantage over fixed razor safety razor heads. I get an amazing shave at setting 2. My previous razor was an Edwin Jagger and I have retired it, only for overnight trips or other short travel. With the Futur, you will immediately notice the advantage of the weight and form factor. Paired with Feather blades, I don&#x27;t believe I can get a better shave, even after only a single pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like everything in life, the best tools can help you reach perfection faster. Not saying you aren&#x27;t getting just as good of a shave with your razor, but this one should get that shave that you are going for with a lot less effort. You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> So far its pretty nice and truly shaves as an aggressive razor which I couldn&#x27;t get a good pass out of the cheaper merkur DE razors. LONG TERM will tell me the real story about the few people experiencing problems with the finish pitting or flaking etc. I do wish the handle was knurled, it&#x27;s not slippery at all but just would like the mental confidence knurling gives. I love the heavy weight, helps allow the razor to do the work with pressure. If the finish doesn&#x27;t mess up if say it&#x27;s a five star</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I really enjoyed using it. If you&#x27;re making the switch, prepare to spend a little more time shaving and LET THE RAZOR DO THE WORK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really a quality product.</li>
    <li> Have tried many Safety Razors [various Merkurs,Jaggers,Muhles] all are good but ,The Futur is without a doubt the best. If you are not into collecting these safety razors and only need one end your search here and buy the Merkur Futur.&lt;br /&gt;Update 09/03/2015 Still the best but have found an open comb razor I love so if anyone has considered trying an open comb razor look for the Phoenix DOC at phoenixartisanaccoutrements.com. A little on the small side but a great shaver.</li>
    <li> The Futur on its lowest setting exposes more blade than the Progess does on its highest setting. For classic Gillette adjustable owners, setting 9 of 9 on the Fatboy or Slim is roughly the same as setting 2 of 6 on the Futur. Plus the Futur is immensely heavy, about 25% heavier than a Progess or a Fatboy. This adds up to a mighty aggressive shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my particular case, I can only use the least sharp blades in the Futur (aka Derby &amp; Merkur) at the lowest possible setting (1 of 6). If I use some sharper blade (Personna Blue, Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Yellows, or even an Astra SP) or dare to crank the dial up to 2 of 6, aaargggh! Lobster face, razor burn for hours, even without any blood. So I can use 1 or 2 types of blades in this, and on only 1 of 6 settings. (There are half point settings as well, but even 1.5 is gap too far for me...) To me, this is not really an adjustable, as I always have to use the same setting and only certain types of blades, unless I want to rip my face off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lest you think me unmanly or inexpert, I will say I have used razors that are heavy (Maggard MR8) and some that are known for having aggressive heads (Parker 92R, Weber PH) and I can get smooth skin and a non-lobster face using those razors with all sorts of blades. It&#x27;s only the Futur that causes me red-faced grief. Of course, in the wet shaving world, we have our flint-bearded Vikings, who have metallic stubble and shave once every several days. If you are one of these types, this may be your razor and maybe you can enjoy different blades and settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the adjustable concept as it gives users a lot of customization options and the ability to mix exposure up during different shave passes. Most users who want this feature set and do not want a deply abraded face would be better off with the Merkur Progress, or a vintage Gillette adjustable if you can get one at a reasonable price (think Super or Slim, not Fatboy!) but for most, the Progress will be the most affordable solution and that model is well made and offers a usable range of adjustment at a cheaper price than the Futur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad rating the Futur poorly. It is well made, and I have none of the usual complaints. The head does indeed fit into the nooks and crannies of my face well enough, and I find blade replacement to be both simple and safe. I just can&#x27;t see paying this much for a razor that (in my case) ends up being non-adjustable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Progress &#x3D; Merkur&#x27;s adjustable for normal human male faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Futur &#x3D; Merkur&#x27;s adjustable for bristle faced Ubermensch.most affordable solution and that model is well made and offers a usable range of adjustment at a cheaper price than the Futur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad rating the Futur poorly.

    <li> Great razor, it is aggressive to extremely aggressive.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I have been shaving for near 50 years with a double edge Gillette Slim Adjustable I bought in 1967.  It started losing its ability to adjust so I researched what to buy.  This is like a cadillac to the Gillette &amp;#34;Volkswagon&amp;#34;.  Wish I could have had this years ago.  I now look forward to shaving.  I do wish the handle was a bit shorter as I can&#x27;t flip it around as easily as I could with the Gillette.  This will be the last razor I have to buy, for sure.</li>
    <li> This is the best safety razor I have used. It is comfortable to grip, easy to adjust the settings, and gives an excellent, close shave. I rarely cut myself, and when I do, it&#x27;s my fault for using an uneven stroke.</li>
    <li> A mate of mine asked me to order this for him. He seems happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great Razor!! The adjustable razor is really helpful getting all areas of your face done perfectly. I also adjust higher on my second and third passes to get a cleaner shave. I would suggest the Merkur Futur to anyone that has been using a razor for awhile. The head of the razor hold heat for along time. Its on the heavier side which makes it feel steadier in your hand. Plus it looks great on your sink in its stand. Typical German engineering, performs perfectly and looks amazing.</li>
    <li> Nice heft, you really have to watch how open the face is because this can razor can cause some serious razor burn if you have it too open. The razor itself is of very high quality and is by far my favorite of my 2 Merkur safety razors. The last razor I will every use or buy</li>
    <li> Excellent product, without it i would scrape all the skin off my head and face. keep it set below one until you learn shaving with it. Trust me!</li>
    <li> I first starting shaving with a double edge shaver when I lived at home back in the early 70&#x27;s. I am not sure what the razor was other than one turned the bottom and the top opened to receive the blade. Of course, I then got caught up in all the technology of the shaving industry and for many years got away from wet shaving. While the cost of buying the blades for all this new technology kept climbing, I decided it was time to get back to basics by using a double edge razor. I purchased my first one at Wal-Mart. It was an American made product similar to the one I used in the 70&#x27;s. It gives one an average shave in that it was never super smooth. I have to say that for the money it is a great way to experience double edge shaving, and is quite safe for someone just starting out. However; one will either love or hate this method of shaving. Once I was convinced this was my future I started looking for a better razor. My search concluded that the Merkur FUTUR was the best choice. I have been using this razor for about a month now and must say I look forward to shaving, in fact, some days I shave twice! The quality of this razor is amazing, so much so, I just enjoy seeing sit on my bathroom sink. The adjustment is very easy to use. I know others state that it is dangerous but if one uses a little common sense there is not much chance of getting cut both while adjusting the shaver or while shaving. The top comes off with just a slight pull on the ends and returns to position just as easily. Yes, it is heavy however, this just ads to the quality of the shave. If you feel it is too heavy you should look for a lighter model as this may not work for you. Judging by the quality of this razor I must assume all of their products are similar in both design and quality. The higher sitting are very aggressive and I would strongly encourage that you start on 1 and work your way up as you gain confidence and skill. I start on three for my first pass and then follow with one or two more passes on 1.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a DE safety razor for some time now, and recently purchased this as an upgrade from my prior 3-piece razor that was made of chrome over brass that most are. My past razor snapped at the handle/head where its threaded after dropping it on the tile floor and is now unrepairable and useless. This razor appealed to me because of its stainless steal construction. I am a man with large hands, and I appreciate the size and weight of this razor. Pay NO attention to reviews that the smooth handle is hard to change adjustments with, and that the blades are difficult or unsafe to change. Some users users want to \\&quot;pull the top off\\&quot;. If you simply read and follow the well-illustrated instructions, it advises that when changing blades to push from the bottom with your thumb and finger one side at a time to release the top from the spring-detent. This is much simpler and faster than any 3-piece or butterfly DE safety razor, and definitely safer than a 3-piece. I have the chrome plated version and love it. It is slick but not too slick or dificult to manage, even after treating my face with pre-shave. If this might present a problem for some, one should just dab some shave soap on their hands after lathering up, wash/rinse their hands, dry their hands and razor and that should do the trick. I have had no need to make changes to the blade adjustment once I found my 4.5 sweet spot. I recommend starting in the middle at 3.5 and going up/down from there. Also, some say that the size of the head of this piece makes it difficult to shave under the nose. I have not found this as a problem with proper skin stretching techniques that are unknown to younger shavers. Enjoy this German-made work of art for your face, it deserves it!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, btw, the neck of this razor is too big to fit in the hanger of some razor/brush hanger/holders.&lt;br /&gt;I love to use:&lt;br /&gt;Proraso white pre-shave, shave soap, after shave&lt;br /&gt;Personna (blue) or Feather blades</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe what this razor does to produce what I look for when it comes to my daily shave. I shave my face as well as my head, and I&#x27;m able to adjust the razor accordingly when moving from my face to my cranium. Along with your favorite blade, you will find that the Futur needs very little help achieving your shaving objective. What a pleasure to wake up to this razor. I look forward to hanging out with it every day. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with your results.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a little too expensive, but when he opened the gift,I could see  it was crafted so well.&lt;br /&gt;the quailty of the metal, highly polished is with out doubt, top notch.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;he says it is the best shave.</li>
    <li> I bought my &amp;#34;futur&amp;#34; about 2 yrs. ago &amp; shave on setting 5. I have never cut myself once. If you take your time and let the blade do the work and don&#x27;t bear down most people are fine. Most cut themselves from bearing down like you have to w/ cheap razors. I am buying my second &amp;#34;futur&amp;#34; for my traveler. I Love mine, the initial cost is higher but you will make it up in a couple years in blade savings. I am a traditionalist I use a badger brush and quality shave soap but the main point is use what works for you.</li>
    <li> Set the razor on the #1 Setting for a quick shave or #6 for an aggressive baby butt smooth shave. Top Notch Quality. By the way, I did find this a bit slipper, so I dipped this in Plasti Dip that you can purchase at Lowes right below the first break on the handle and it looks even nicer and does not slip. Lowes carries this product in the paint department and they keep it in a steel cage where all the spray paints are carried.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the high reviews and the fact it&#x27;s made by Merkur (German company).&lt;br /&gt;I started using this week.  It has great workmanship and shaves consistently.  The only complaint I have is that the top is very heavy and my hand/fingers had to take a couple of breaks before finishing my shave. So, if you&#x27;re used to light (in weight) shavers, you have quite a bit of getting used to While trying not to get nicked.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent seller, a real asset for Amazon</li>
    <li> This little gem did a great job.  The adjustment settings on the head either make the cutting angle and surface exposure more aggresive at 6, or much less agressive at 1, for those with more sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the shaving head is quite significant compared to other DE shavers, therefore no added pressure is needed.  Let the handle do the work and do not press firmly against the skin.  The handle can get a little slick with the polished chrome surface, but a secure grip and pacing yourself will avoid any unnecessary blood loss.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re holding a greased up pig when your shaving as some comments have complained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is the size of the shaving head.  It&#x27;s a little big and can be difficult to maneuver in tighter spots like under your nose and behind your ears (head shaving). The constructution is rock solid and seems like it&#x27;ll still be here in thirty years.  Solid sturdy metal.  Overall,  great DE system for both newbies and vets alike.  Worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the story, in my view gents. This is one very nice razor. I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews as to how &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; this is. Not so in my opinion. Granted there is a much larger gap opening compared to say, my old standby Gillette. With that being said, if you know how to shave with a DE style razor, it is not an issue. Of course, face contour, blade selection, pre-shave conditioning etc. all play an important role. Like any new razor, there is a slight learning curve. With all the being said, I got a great shave my first time, with no cuts, or nicks. This shaves so well, that I can &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; skip a day. Beautiful in design and craftsmanship, it makes my morning shave a real pleasure. Enjoy one!</li>
    <li> This is my fourth safety razor and by far the best used it for the first time this morning.  The shave was excellent no effort the weight of the razor does all the work.  I wish I would have bought this razor first.  The craftsmanship of the razor is high quality.  Highly recommend this razor to anyone that wants to start shaving the correct way the old fashion way.</li>
    <li> Holy cow!  I only use this thing if there is someone around who can stop the bleeding after I pass out!  It is science fiction and not meant to be used on a human&#x27;s face!  Avoid at all costs.  I am an experienced wet shaver, but this thing is cra cra!  I love my Merkur barber pole and Merkur 1904 replica, but don&#x27;t let the brand name fool you.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the high of the high end when it comes to razors, safety and straight. But the appeal of an adjustable one was just too great to not try it. Three months later I&#x27;ve stopped using my straight razors short of white tie events. This is truly a fantastic idea and execution, the ease of blade exchange is a very appreciated added bonus.</li>
    <li> I started DE shaving just a few weeks ago and have gotten the hang of it and am enjoying my shaves. I started with the feather popular and loved it expect for the fact that it had it a plastic handle...not cheap but nothing fancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to upgrade since I knew I was going to stick with DE shaving and the Merkur Futur had my attention. As soon as I got the razor I knew I had a quality product in my hand. Around the same time I also bought a shaving kit with a stand/soap/brush and a Merkur long handle razor. The Futur makes every other razor feel and look cheap. It really is built like a tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the chrome finish on the razor although cream/soap will leave residue until cleaned with soap/water and soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like the the blade change mechanism and find it easier than a three piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is very good, the best shave I ever got BUT for me the fact that this an adjustable is almost useless since my sensitive skin can&#x27;t handle any setting higher than two. I just leave the razor on 1 or 1.5 and that is the setting where I can get a close shave without irritation. I use it on 2 if I haven&#x27;t shaved for a couple of days. Any higher and I get nicks/cuts and major razor burn...and no my technique isn&#x27;t bad I just have sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t have a light beard either it&#x27;s moderately heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the head is large and makes it a little difficult to get the whiskers under the nose, but with a little practice you should have no problems. It is a little slippery when wet but I make sure that my hands are dry before handling so no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the Futur is a beautiful heavy razor that shaves great and seems built to last. I knocked off one star because the adjustable settings are almost useless for my skin type although might be great for others and it could have better grip. Still its the best razor I have used so far. If your looking for an aggressive adjustable razor then this is thebest razor you can get, if you have sensitive skin or prefer milder razors then you might not want to spend so much on a razor that you will probably use like a fixed head. I don&#x27;t regret my purchase one bit and as the saying goes YMMV.</li>
    <li> Very awesome. Love they it allows you to adjust the aggressiveness of the blade</li>
    <li> This razor takes a few Knicks to get figured out, but is very adaptable to a variety of blades and skin types. Happy with service and quality. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my significant other&#x27;s birthday. It arrived yesterday and I am very impressed with the quality. I&#x27;m sure he will be very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> I love this razor so much I bought 2. Glad I didn&#x27;t start with this one though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a double edge shaver for over 33 years.  For the first 32.5 years, my everyday razor was a Gillette butterfly razor and I was happy.  Eventually the old Gillette just wore out.  Rather than getting it refurbished, I decided to find something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 months ago, I bought the Merkur Futur with the chrome finish.  Beautiful razor, but I wanted to give it some time before reviewing.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the razor -- I still look forward to using it everyday.  It has a hefty weight that feels solid in the hand.  Some people have reported it to be slippery, but I don&#x27;t think so at all.  No slips in the past 6 months.  The blade setting adjustment works great.  I&#x27;d caution people to be careful starting out.  At higher settings, the razor takes a very aggressive cut.  I&#x27;ve found my sweet spot at a setting of 3 to 3.5 out of 6.  At this setting, it still takes a more aggressive cut than did my old Gillette that was set at a 9 out of 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing blades is easy, just pop off the blade cover by pressing up with you thumb on the end of the cover.  Some reviewers have said that this is difficult or dangerous, but I find it very easy.  While the cover is off and the blade is out, I also give the razor a quick clean.  Then just drop in the new blade, click on the cover, and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend to anyone.  With the special caution to folks just starting out with double edge razors, take it slow with a low blade setting until you get used to the razor.</li>
    <li> Just incredible. I&#x27;m pretty new to DE shaving, and I bought an Edwin Jagger a month ago. Great razor, but the closeness of the shave left something to be desired. I decided to take a chance on the Futur, and wow, I&#x27;m impressed. It is adjustable from 1-6, with 1 being the safest but not closest, 6 being the closest, but requiring some skill not to cut yourself. I started with setting #1 for 2 weeks, but just shaved with #1.5 for the first time, and the difference, especially around the chin and neck area, is noticeable. Much closer shave. I&#x27;m going to gradually increase until I reach the point of skin irritation, and then dial it back half a notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple this with some Proraso shave cream and a good brush, and you&#x27;ll never go back to the mass market shaving products. I promise you. Awesome. And the razor itself is a work of art. Bravo, Merkur!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade that you use matters, too. I like the Personnas, but there are several great options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0077LAJT2 Personna Double Edge Razor Blades]]</li>
    <li> I have to say, never using a safety razor before, i was scared as hell.  When i was younger, i used to get ingrown hairs across my neck.  Those eventually disappeared over the years. But due to my ethnic origin, my facial hair doesn&#x27;t grown in only one direction.  After getting tired of overpriced, expensive mach3 type setups, i decide to try and go old school.  I must say that i waited way too long to test the waters.  This thing cuts so damn close that I was speechless. My first shave today with this razor was the best shave I&#x27;ve had in decades. Bravo!!!</li>
    <li> This is a serious razor nice whight feels good in the hand looks pretty sharp also a must buy can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> had trouble with my first razor . wouldn&#x27;t give close shave. got this razor and it is great. close shave and did not have to adjust settings!! heavier than the other razor but just right  for me!! would recommend this razor to anyone who enjoys close shave and i personally will not use any other razor for a great shave</li>
    <li> This razor and personna or feather blades is the best shave you&#x27;ll ever have! Adjusted to setting 4 right now and it&#x27;s all good. Love the chrome!</li>
    <li> a little on the heavy side,could be longer,but ok once you get used to it</li>
    <li> Read much reviews of various razors, as well as the pros/cons of the Merkur.  Also even bought a Mergress XL for comparison.  First, let me tell you to just go with the chrome first.  The satin looks nasty after a couple of uses in the shower environment, whereas the chrome wipes off and stays looking great.&lt;br /&gt;  Also, this baby has settings for 1-6.  I think you&#x27;re going into bloody waters if you go anywhere above the setting of &amp;#34;2.&amp;#34;  People complain about the large head, but after using the Mergress I favor my Progress&#x27; large head.  It seems to help spread the skin and keep it tight as it passes, like a wave parting the sea for the blade to pass!  Can be tough under the nose, but around those neck and jawbone angles you&#x27;ll appreciate the forgiveness it affords you.  I shave my head with this as well, almost daily.  Watch a few youtube vids on shaving with these, three passes really gives you a baby smooth shave.  First with the grain, then across, and then against the grain up the cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;  Update:  The problem with the Futur razor lies within the fact the head does not thread down to slightly bend the blade, like a Progress does.  Watch the sharpologist video on using this razor, this neutral seating of the blade is likely why you have to use it with the handle at such a high rake, and why when shaving under the nose, you can easily carve a divot out.  I have moved on to only using my Progress and &#x27;59 Fatboy.  Shame, because this razor looks great otherwise in it&#x27;s proportions and balance.  With a safety razor that bends the blade when the head is seated, the user can shave with the handle in a much more natural grip.  Will try a slant or 34c next.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and my shaves have improved greatly from my first DE razor.  I marked it down to 4 stars, however, because of the danger when changing settings with a blade installed.  When I read about using the FUTUR, most places say that it will be safe to move the head with dry hands, but while shaving you should use a towel for a better, safer grip.  I would advise you to always use a towel to cover the head of this razor when making adjustments.  It is a little stiff trying to turn the head of the razor.  I accidentally popped the cap off while trying to turn the razor head, with dry hands, and found that a brand new feather blade can damn near remove your finger!  20 minutes of bleeding and swearing later, I promised myself never to adjust the razor without first covering it with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, though, this razor performs fantastically!  I really do love it.</li>
    <li> Man, I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this razor. This is a one stop shop for all your shaving needs.  I literally look forward to shaving my head and face with the Futur. The one most important thing to remember is to respect this razor or if not you&#x27;ll come out looking like you got tangled in constantine wire. It takes some time to find the right angle and setting for yourself but when you do,  it will be the most enjoyable shaving experience you can get. I keep mine set at 3  sometimes 4, but 3 seems to work best when shaving my head. Look no further and purchase this blitzkrieg of a razor,  you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> heavy heavy  . i dropped  it twice on first shave  too smooth handle  .wrapped a rubber band on it . you must grab the head to adjust setting  slicey slicey u fingers . needs a slip on rubber grip of some kind  good shave  looks kool</li>
    <li> This razor is the best one that I have and I have about 8 different razor&#x27;s . I have been shaving for over 50 years now and most of them with double edge razor&#x27;s. This one is nice and heavy and all I have to do is guide it and let it do the cutting. I have not had any nick&#x27;s so far and no razor burn&#x27;s with it. Very nice style also. Everyone that see&#x27;s it , comment&#x27;s as to how nice it look&#x27;s . It&#x27;s a Roll Roice of Razor&#x27;s . I don&#x27;t have any problem&#x27;s getting close around the tight spot&#x27;s on my face as some have commented with this razor. I just tighten up my lip and it get&#x27;s all the hair close to the nose with none left behind. Very easy on the face and I have used Feather, Personna, Merker, Shark, Dorco and Derbh Blades all with very good result&#x27;s on this razor. I recommend this razor to anyone, beginner&#x27;s and seasond shaver&#x27;&#x27;s to get this razor. It will adjust to you type of beard. Thank&#x27;s</li>
    <li> In my honest opinion, this is the absolute best safety razor for the money. Personally I have this FUTUR razor and one open comb razor, a &amp;#34;Muhle R41&amp;#34; and I need nothing else. The FUTUR has 6 settings, and each one of those settings provide a different approach to process of shaving, it&#x27;s like having 6 razors in one.</li>
    <li> use a good blade;for me, the free included blade  was not as good as the astra sp, or polsilver that i have. that is blade specific. the razor is fantastic! solid heft; better build it seems than the vision. chrome is the finish to get on this, so much nicer than the satin IMHO.setting 1 will suffice for about 80%, setting two for the next 10%, 3 and up are for experienced wet shavers. you will love this razor, better than a vision, at least equal to my vintage gillette adjustables! worth every penny at this very good price.</li>
    <li> This is a great safety razor.  I love the adjustable handle that gives me a good clean shave. At times I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> I started shaving at 17 and I have a very thick, coarse beard.  I&#x27;ve always used gillette mach 3 and different types of electric razors.  Regardless of what I used, I never could get that super close shave and by noon I always had a five o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The merkur futur came highly recommended by a few friends so after months of hesitation (and fear of slicing my face open), I picked it up along with prorasso shaving cream and an inexpensive badger hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first few shaves were very slow and careful.  I didn&#x27;t try to shave too closely as I didn&#x27;t want to cut my face up.  It only took about a week to get used to the razor.  I tinkered with the adjustment before setting on a 3.5.  Now, when I shave, I get the closest shaves ever with minimal irritations.  I do typically get very minor knicks here and there but cold water and a good aftershave make them pretty much unnoticeable.  I imagine that with a little more practice or dialing back to a 3 would leave me with pretty much no knicks at all.  I have also been using Astra blades, exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re contemplating picking this up, I say go for it.  With a little practice and the right blades and shaving cream for your skin and beard type, you&#x27;ll definitely get a clean, close shave.</li>
    <li> Love this razor! It has great balance &amp; even though there is no knurling on the handle I don&#x27;t find it slippery in the least! It has something for everyone with its adjustability, as mild or aggressive as you want.</li>
    <li> After several months of go-no-go, I finally bit the bullet and ordered this from US. Someone carried it over for me to India.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after two months of use (around twice a week), I am still learning how to use this.&lt;br /&gt;My previous razor was the Gillette Proglide Power and the only reason for ditching that was the high costs of the cartridges. Well Merkur tool all of my money in one-shot. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I mostly use settings around 4 (anything higher means lots of blood shed and anything lower, means hardly any cutting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chorme is of high quality and there is no impact or discoloration at all.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is heavy and I enjoy the weight.&lt;br /&gt;The razor did not have any explanation on the values (higher setting means what?) so it was a trial and error for me.&lt;br /&gt;This is excellent if you want to reduce the hair, but it does not give you any advantage if you want to get a really close shave, compare to the Gillettes that I have been using for ages.&lt;br /&gt;Three passes are required and if I try to get a close shave, I do cut myself, especially near the neck region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, getting a baby-smooth shave is a must, else my toddler just does not want to hold my cheeks. And perhaps I was expecting Merkur FUTUR to do that for me. So, a bit disappointed considering the price of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came with one Merkur blade and now I use the 7&#x27; oclock and other local blades. All blades seem to have the same performance/ life span of around 4-5 shaves.</li>
    <li> Love this Razor!! Great for Shaving my head.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality but I still prefer my Merkur Vision. Personal Preference.</li>
    <li> Great safety razor, only one of two on the market that are adjustable, both produced by Merkur. The razor has a nice heft to it and cuts almost by itself. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to shavers new to wet shaving, however seasoned wet shavers could hardly do better than the Mekur Futur!</li>
    <li> This is my first adjustable Razor, I like the fact you can change the blade angle.  Blade replacement is easy, Razor has great balance, although it is a bit heavier and bulkier than my older Gillette Razors.  I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a DE Adjustable Razor.</li>
    <li> best razor ever used, better than the Merkur slant, Edwin Jagger whom i have both .&lt;br /&gt;i pare it with feather razor, set it to # 4 mark and shave. No cuts , and never slipped from my hand even if it was soapy .</li>
    <li> Totally happy, great shipment....all satisfied, thank you</li>
    <li> Good razor. Good vender.</li>
    <li> Sweet Razor. The only concern I have is the top that holds the blade in place is press down fit.  Most things that fit like that tend to get lose over the years and sloppy or fail.  I guess we will see in 5 years what its status is and report ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice feel, Good shave. Not slippery in your hands at all.  I had thought it might be when I looked at it originally but it stays put in your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Nice razor.</li>
    <li> Is it awkward at first? Yes! Do you get used to it? Yes! This was my first safety razor I ever used. I even use it for shaving my head. It got my good a cpl of times but been smoothing sailing ever since. I like that it is adjustable and I do use different settings a lot with it. I have found that not having stippling has not affected my grip on it. Never came close to dropping it yet and I even use it in the shower. Only tricky thing is getting close to your ears and trimming but you find a way that works.</li>
    <li> This SR is extremely well made as well as being heavy.  The very high quality chrome and the heft does put the shaver in some dangerous position when in a rush to execute a shave.  BUT, using a safety razor in itself should not involve any rushing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From some internet reviews, there are different setting that can be used to angle the blades on the Merkur.  The 4 that some people are using, to my opinion is overtly aggressive.  The first 2 times I have used the Merkur with the factory Merkur blade on 4 left me cut and bleeding in many areas.  But, after reading some other opinions, I have re adjusted the blade angle to 1.  Now I nick a lot less with the passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to pick up some decent shaving soap and a nice brush to apply it.  Safety Razor shaves should NEVER use standard shaving creams as they lose moisture quickly in the face.</li>
    <li> The quality of this razor is excellent. It is weighted well, and adjustable, so it is a fine razor for the long term. The finish is done well, and the head is easy to load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an experienced safety razor user, it is a great razor. For someone new to safety razors, fair warning... this isn&#x27;t a razor you use blind in the shower. Use a mirror. Using it blind in the shower you can remove a good portion of your facial skin as well as the beard. I know from experience. Have a styptic pencil handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade that comes with it is extremely fine and sharp. The beveled edge of the razor provides the proper shaving angle to keep from being cut (but again, watch yourself in the mirror).</li>
    <li> My husband actually looks for excuses to shave! That has never been the case with countless disposable razors, changeable head type or the three different electric ones he has had in the last 5 years.  He went from always on the verge of giving up and growing a beard (which he did do also) to actually not hating shaving!  I would definitely recommend, we are getting them for his brothers too!  To be saving money on the replacement blades is just the cherry on top!</li>
    <li> My most used adjustable razor. The heft and feel is great. A safety tip remove the blade before adjusting or you will cut your finger as I did. Mantic 59 had often said that. I just don&#x27;t listen. The shave with this razor is close and comfortable and I only used two passes.</li>
    <li> This thing is very heavy and awkward to handle.  A lot of weight and not what I would call user friendly.  I think the adjustment set up is dangerous with the way it is engineered.  When you try to turn the dial to change settings the whole razor tries to move with it and if you are holding it by the head, the blade has the tendency to cut you if you are not holding it with a cloth on the head.  The pop off cap is nice but again, be very careful when using it.  Exposed blade is right there to slice you if you have a moment of inattention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely constructed other than hard to use in a tight area ( under your nose ) Not a  lot of room to work with it as the head is so large.  I have nicer razors for less money. It does have a very shiny finish and looks good, just not what I call easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Great razor! Only downside is that there is no knurled holder...</li>
    <li> Looks great, but is very heavy and slippery, so requires tight grip that makes precise shaving more difficult. I was unable to find a setting that gave a close shave without cuts. I replaced it with a simple, non-adjustable Merkur that shaves closer and never cuts me.</li>
    <li> If u feel like cutting your head like a arthritic surgeon by all means go back to grandpa&#x27;s gear.</li>
    <li> good job in this razor👍</li>
    <li> What a beautiful razor this is. The adjusting razor works wonders while I use it on my head and face. The easy pull off head to  add, replace or clean my blade is wonderful. It is heavier then my Edwin jagger but it makings shaving easier. Easy to use , looks amazing what else can I say. Oh yeah cleaning is super simple.</li>
    <li> This razor has class shaves as good as it looks.</li>
    <li> So I bought mine two years ago as my first de razor after reading all the great reviews.  That was a mistake. After cutting my face up for a week I stopped using it and went back to disposable razors.  Fast forward two years and I decided I wanted to get back into wet shaving so I tried this again and the shave was just OK but I didn&#x27;t cut myself at least and I used a low setting. Still took too many passes and the more passes you take the more likely you will cut yourself. I decided I needed a better razor so I bought the $15 feather de since I like feather blades.  Can&#x27;t go wrong for that price I thought.  Well the razor was so mild I had to actually press down quite firmly and make many passes which gave me razor burn.  I used it four times and then threw it in the trash. Next up was the Edwin Jagger de89 and that was better than the cheap feather but still not very close and required too many passes.  This was beginning to get frustrating so as a last ditch effort I busted out my 2 years old merkur futur and turned it to it&#x27;s it&#x27;s most aggressive setting.  I shaved VERY carefully and only had one tiny nick but when I was done I had the smoothest shave ever.  Even on the lower settings it was much closer than the other two razors I tried. It&#x27;s very heavy and very solid and is not slippery at all in the hand.  I would suggest learning your technique on a mild razor and then when you have the basics get this. It&#x27;s a fine precision instrument that will get you that smooth shave you&#x27;ve been searching for.</li>
    <li> this shaver is great but got to have the right blades to your liking.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Nice weight, easy to change blades and adjust blade.</li>
    <li> Love my merkur. Looks good and shaves well. Very heavy. Have settled in on around 2 1/2 setting with Derby blades and get an excellent shave</li>
    <li> I have one of these; it was a gift.  I thought I would pass it on to my grandchildren- it is just so cool looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, kiddies, it is made of die cast zinc.  Drop it in the sink (the handle smooth) and it bends; now one side cuts more than the other!  Further, it is corroding to the point where the top, which retains the blade, will not stay attached.  I would score this a ZERO if given the option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a Gillette, if you can find one.  Mine is still ticking after 45 years, and it ain&#x27;t made of zinc.</li>
    <li> Great razor from an excellent company. Punctual, excellent products and top notch customer service.</li>
    <li> This razor is magnificent in it&#x27;s engineering, a work of art.  Saying that I encountered a problem after 1 week of using the razor, the adjustment head began to loosen.  It loosened to the point where it would shift during shaving.  I kept it at the 1.5 setting by the end of the shave it had shifted up to almost 2.5.  Although it is a marvel from an engineering standpoint they should have designed a click setting to ensure it stays at the desired setting.  Maybe the razor I received was a fluke but moving a whole setting is unacceptable.  Too bad as I really tried to look past the issue but to constantly keep checking to see if the setting moved  is not something that is desirable for a razor of this caliber and price.</li>
    <li> If you admire well crafted and elegantly styled objects that have nearly perfect fit and finish this one is for you. Do not get this or an other double edge razor if you intend to rush through shaving.  Know that you must take a little extra time.  I recommend getting a blade variety pack to see which blade you like the best, if you are new to this kind of razor.  You should know that this razor is heavier than the old Gillette razors, and the handle is longer.  Be sure you can be comfortable with that.  Additionally, the handle is slippery when wet.  To change blades you must remove the top rather than twist it open.  Once you get used to those factors, it will give you the closest shave you have ever had.  I liked it so much I bought a second one for my son. It does have several adjustable setting, and I believe that its hight quality makes it worth getting used to.</li>
    <li> well worth the money, and well constructed built to last. I received a quality shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update... I&#x27;ve been using this razor a few months now, and my opinion remains that this is an excellent and well construct tool. My only knock is that it&#x27;s very heavy in comparison to other safety razors. With that being said; control can be a bit challenging at various angles beneath the chin for example.</li>
    <li> This is quality, heavy-duty equipment.The adjustable feature is good, but I don&#x27;t know who could use the higher settings: I set it at about 2 and I have to go with the lightest possible pressure or It&#x27;ll plane off some skin. Using it this way I get better shaves than I have by any other method, without nicks or scrapes. The razor has a good finish, an attractive shape, is relatively heavy, and is pleasing to hold. For newcomers (as I was -- I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver for years), practice is the key to finding which way your beard grows and to finding the right very light touch.</li>
    <li> I  have been using this double edge safety razor for 5 years now. It is the best adjustable safety razor on the market. MADE in GERMANY. It feels solid, well-built and simple. If you think how much you spend on gilette or schick refills - you get a fantastic razor and in the long run save money. Imaging getting the Merkur German stainless steel razors for 7.00 for 10. Which basically gives you 2 sizes or sharp close shaves. There is a reason Gillette and Schick don&#x27;t want you to buy this - cause they&#x27;ll lose all their profit on their plastic refills.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this razor. For those who complain of being cut when using it (or needing a blood transfusion afterwards), I have to think you are either doing something incorrectly or (perhaps) need to try a different blade. I am a first-time safety razor user and I didn&#x27;t cut myself the very first time I used it even. I would suggest using a pre-shave lotion before applying shaving cream/soap because I had slight (seriously mild... Persistent for less than 20 minutes) post-shave discomfort afterwards when I did not do so, but still never cut myself. Do NOT use the same force as you would with a cartridge razor. The weight of the razor (with just enough resistance to keep it level against your skin) is sufficient. This thing has given me the closest and best shave I have ever had. My cartridge razor was breaking me out along this one particular area around just beneath my chin. Although it consistently happened for months previously, since I switched to this safety razor, it has not happened at all. I actually enjoy shaving now and that speaks volumes because I absolutely hated it before.</li>
    <li> The Merkur Futur is an aggressive razor from setting 1 through 6.  That being said, it is also a very smooth shave if your DE technique is solid.&lt;br /&gt;It is built like a tank, and my Futur with the polished chrome is quite the looker....&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this razor to someone who has never shaved with a Double Edged razor.  This is not a beginners razor.  And seasoned veterans of this razor know that if you don&#x27;t pay attention to the shave, there will be blood.</li>
    <li> I did the research an bought a high quality DE safety razor and a straight razor shavette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are antiquated, time consuming, and produce inferior results, compared to modern cartridge razors.  Every time I would shave I would cut myself. The DE razors would cut every bump on my head or face. I gave up when I filleted one inch of skin from my scalp with the Futur set to 6 going with the grain. Shaving with on 3 did not produce a close shave no matter what direction I shaved in. Razor burn was outrageous compared to a cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason Gillette stop making DE safety razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the FUTUR several times now and I&#x27;m still trying to adjust to the right setting.  I&#x27;ve been using ASTRA blades and using Proraso soap.  Dialing in is tricky because some days I get irritation and some days not.  When it is dialed in right(#2.5), I get a good shave.  I think my problem is as others have said, the razor is REALLY heavy as opposed to others I&#x27;ve used.  On my face I don&#x27;t have a problem but when it comes to shaving my neck area, the bulkiness and weight of the FUTUR does affect the shave.  I am considering picking up a smaller/lighter adjustable razor but I&#x27;m not giving up on this one yet.  Merkur is a good brand and it&#x27;s a nice looking razor.  Unfortunately, after a shave I need to wipe it down because the head and handle both get this cloudiness I&#x27;m guessing from the lather.  Once it&#x27;s wiped, it&#x27;s shiney though once again.</li>
    <li> I am new to wet shaving and did not want to have to purchase several razors to find out which works best and how.  The Merkur Futur adjustable safety razor may cost a little more but is a quality piece that is easy to use and with practice will provide a perfect shave for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the Merkur DE blades to start and they work well and I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I was at first very timed to about using this razor, especially after the first time I used it I cut myself pretty good. But I stuck with it and I love this thing now. Its true you dont always need to adjust it when your shaving. But what the adjustment ability alows you to do is find that setting thats perfect for you. It only has six numbered settings but theres also notches for .5 so you can really dial it down to what you want. I have seen reviews about the handle being slick. Yes, it can get slick. It has a nice pollish to it and if you have a wet/ soapy hand you will not be able to hold it very well at all. My solution, keep your hand dry and rinse the head so the soap doesnt go doen the handle. Do that and you will not have any problems getting a sure grip. Another thing to note it this thing is heavy! Which is a good thing since all you have to do is guid it, pull strech your face and you will get a closer shave than you would have ever thought possible. This thing will not be forgiving at all, but if you stick with it and work on your technic shaving will become a joy. I know it has with me.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and as a side note get a good pre-shave oil and use products with NO alchol. It&#x27;ll help with getting that supper close shave with no nicks.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my father and he loves it! It&#x27;s his go to razor now. The adjustable feature is really cool and he says it feels very solid in his hand. He says he hasn&#x27;t had any problem with the handle getting too slippery. Overall, I&#x27;m very glad I bought this for him.</li>
    <li> I used to use Gillette Power ProFusion the blades were expensive and do not provide the close shave the Mekur delivers.  There&#x27;s a slight learning curve to its use, but easy to master.  You will not be disappointed.  If you have never used a safety razor before recommend you view some of the youtube videos on the subject.  The weight of the razor and the adjustment of the blade exposure does the work for you.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money. Best shave i&#x27;ve had from a razor shaver and over time will shave you money as well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Wet shaving is so more economical than disposables, Ha! Down the rabbit hole I went...started with a $15 weishi, then a parker 96R now the Futur. Excellent razor as all the others have said. Best shave I&#x27;ve gotten outside of a barbers chair. Very close and smooth on setting 3 and an Astra superior platinum blade for me. Dont worry about the chrome finish, I haven&#x27;t experienced any slipping from the handle during use.</li>
    <li> this is my first safety razor and what a dream. I&#x27;ll never go back to those rip off disposals. This is a high quality precision machine!</li>
    <li> it provides a shave as close as you want it (use caution when you start shaving with this adjustable razor, if you are a beginner you may want to set it on a 2, just to make sure you don&#x27;t cut yourself that often ). Make sure you put a good brand/sharp razor blade or it may not perform as well...and it will make you cry (because the blade will pull your face hair instead of cutting them). Remember to clean it and oil it at least weekly so you can keep it working properly. I&#x27;ve had mine for about four months and still working like new.</li>
    <li> I started shaving when I was 16 years old. That would be 56 years ago. Used Gillette DE blades in an old razor discarded by my dad. That was back in the days when Birthday and Christmas presents were items of necessity like shirts, socks, underwear and, yes, razors. For Christmas when I was 17, I was gifted a Gillette with the wing top doors but it was not adjustable. Later, when I was in the Army I bought the same type Gillette razor that had the adjustable blade exposure. Now for all of you young guys, there is no shave like the shave in the morning with cold water using your steel pot (helmet) for a wash basin and some grainy shave cream that came from a tube. In fact, the shave cream was so bad that it was advertised as a waterless shave. Years passed and I finally succumbed to the propaganda about the great multi-bladed razors when I was probably 40 or 45 years old. Shaves were so bad that I would have five-o-clock shadow by 2 in the afternoon. Many days, depending on what was going on, I would break out the spare shaving kit that I kept in my desk and shave again over the noon hour. About a month ago, I finally decided to go back to a DE razor. The Merkur FUTUR caught my eye because it had the look of complete functionality and it was adjustable. Now this is the finest razor I have ever owned. Nice and heavy yet easy to navigate across my old gnarly face. Bottom line is; this is a shaving instrument, not a razor.</li>
    <li> This DE razor is bigger and heavier that  the Gillette units, but the heavier weight allows me to reduce the pressure on my face which means a nick free shave.</li>
    <li> Saw this razor first at the Art of Shaving store, and found it to be very well built and easy to use, however in the retail store it was much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to search on Amazon and found SimplyBeautiful, great reviews and great prices.  Product shipped same day it was ordered so I had it in my hands in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight is something you will have to get used to if you have been using disposable &amp;#34;Bic&amp;#34; razors.  Get yourself some good quality shaving soap or creme and a good quality Badger Bristle Brush.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> This is a well-made razor and works very well.  I only have one complaint; it slips out of the hand very easily so I&#x27;ve had to put a rubber grip on it.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!  It&#x27;s weight makes shaving nearly effortless.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it&#x27;s performance or with it&#x27;s finish.  I was worried about it becoming slippery when wet, but have found it&#x27;s a non issue--never lost my grip on it.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s another razor out there that looks this good or is of higher quality.</li>
    <li> BEST !! Razor I have bought. Closest shaves I have ever had. I do a pre shave from Proraso, use feather blades and OOOOOO man. Silky smooth Boys. BUY it !!</li>
    <li> Works great and you can get pretty close to perfect with just one pass. The down sides are it is large and does not fit in any of my stands then to change the blades you just pop the top off and I wonder if over time if this will not seat as nice as it does now. Also afraid I might slip and cut myself when I change blades.</li>
    <li> I was given a very nice shaving brush and high quality shaving cream as a gift recently and decided to research more into wet shaving.  I typically used a Gillette Mach 3 razor and would use blades until they practically tore my face due to the high cost of replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In researching DE Safety razors I concluded even with the cost of entry of purchasing the razor, the overall cost savings would be significant by switching to the safety razor.  I selected the Merkur FUTUR razor because it was essentially the only available razor that was adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is built impressively and even though I chose the chrome finish, it is very easy to hold.  The proof is that I get some amazingly close shaves and the razor is a joy to use!  I can&#x27;t shave as quickly as with the Mach 3 but that is the sacrifice when moving to a DE razor.  That said, the entire experience of using the brush, shaving cream, safety razor has actually made shaving enjoyable for me.</li>
    <li> Just got it in today. Wow the design and finish is just incredible - it truly is a work of art. It also has a nice weight which if it didn&#x27;t I&#x27;d send it back because I like very aggressive razors and a heavy razor esp the handle is a must. I&#x27;ve admired this razor for a long time and after reading on some shaving boards that at the #6 (max) setting it is equal to or greater than the Muhle R41 in aggressiveness - the R41is my daily razor. After shaving with it I&#x27;d say it was a close tie except that the Futur gave me a little irritation and I usually don&#x27;t get any with the R41. Therefore if irritation is how you define aggressiveness the Furtur wins. I define it by how close a shave you get with the least amount of passes. However the closeness matched the R41 but did not exceed it. I do have stubborn spots and it took just as much touch up as the 41 does for me. Now some have said the handle is slippery w wet hands especially on the chrome model - honestly that&#x27;s bullcrap if you put your thumb and forefinger in the groove and keep a secure grip on the handle with your remaining fingers and palm there&#x27;s no slipping and trust me any shave ESPECIALLY an aggressive shave demands no slippage from the razor. People have also complained about the head size I found no problem getting into tight spaces. In the moustache area I stretch my lip like I&#x27;m yawning but keep my mouth closed. One thing I was a bit concerned about was blade flex at the highest setting because not only is there a lot of blade gap there also looked to be half a mm gap between the cap and blade but I didn&#x27;t notice any blade flex during my shave. To deal with the minor irritation I&#x27;ve found a drop of pure lanolin oil mixed w wet hands tamps down the burn then after you wash it off apply a shave balm. I&#x27;ve always loved adjustables and they were invaluable to me when I first started learning wet shaving about 6 years ago. but once I got accomplished with angles and pressure I found them to not be aggressive enough and as soon as I heard about the R41 I was right on it. So whether you like mild or aggressive razors you cannot go wrong with this model. it will be a part of my regular shaving routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shave setup: The Futur, A fresh Feather blade, Mitchells Wool Fat shave soap, Omega pro48 boar brush - lather technique: face lather. 3 pass w touch ups. Post shave: Thayers witch hazel,  lanolin oil followed by Nivea shaving balm.nough and as soon as I heard about the R41 I was right on it.

    <li> only currently made razor that is adjustable, well made a little harder to clean than a butterfly razor.  smooth finish can be a little slippery at times. the adjustable feature is great. The weight of this razor is also excellent.</li>
    <li> nice weight to it---fit and finish first class---handle is not slippery at all---easy to adjust, change blade and clean---assembly and disassembly easy and safe---adjusted position is positive, no creeping out of position---very satisfied and would buy again---tried a few positions and settled on 1 1/2, 1 3/4---use other razor for close lip and trim work</li>
    <li> You need to understand something: I am not a shaving aficionado. I do not fancy long shaves and I have a rather utilitarian view of shaving razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all this the first thing I have to say is wow!! The razor is just awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionality-wise it works flawlessly. There are no bells and whistles and hence very easy to clean. You take out the top pop in the blade and put the top back in. The adjustment works fine. At 6 least aggressive I could shave pretty effortlessly and never cut myself* . The weight of the razor does most of the job. As some reviewers have noted that the handle is smooth (which it is) and hence it doesn&#x27;t grip well when wet. Personally I didn&#x27;t feel that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economy wise there is little to say. This item will probably last you a lifetime and it is well known (and documented) that safety razors pay for themselves pretty soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics wise: It is a beautifully designed mechanical piece. It doesn&#x27;t distract. It feels good to touch.  Wonderfully balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to venture into the niche world of wet shaving without sacrificing practical functionality.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor but this is a very nice one. It&#x27;s only flaw is caused by the sleek style it has, this thing is very slipper when you are shaving and you get your hands wet...watch out!</li>
    <li> There are few razors in this world that can give an exceptionally close shave from the very first pass - this is one of them. Looking forward to having this razor for a very long time indeed.</li>
    <li> Great razor and looks great too!  Nice heavy weight and good handle.  Perfect for every shave.</li>
    <li> I have a Merkur long handle that works great i just wanted to try something new.  The push down head with a bracket lock down has me a little concerned for longevity but the shave was fantastic.  Its a little heavier than what im used to but thats no issue.  Ive only shaved on the least agressive setting and the shave was great.  After a few months ill repost how the razor is holding up.</li>
    <li> husband loves this product.  this product is higher in price, but worth it</li>
