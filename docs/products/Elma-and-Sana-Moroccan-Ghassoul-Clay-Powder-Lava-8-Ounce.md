      <li>Nice for drying-up any oil, blisters, zits and removing blackheads.  </li>
      <li>I mix it with apple cider vinegar, rose water, and smear it on.</li>
      <li>The best way I found to wash it off is by splashing my face with warm water until the mask starts to soften up, and then gently wipe it off with my hands and more warm water.  </li>
      <li>Now some say that you should mix it with rose water, but honestly, I didn&#x27;t feel like ordering that since I can always soothe my skin afterward with my Heritage Rose Water spray (which I love just for</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First of all, I received this in good condition and very fast. Second of all, I just want to say this clay is amazing! I bought it for my hair but just washed my hair so decided to try it on my face and couldn&#x27;t believe the results.  My face is as soft as a babies bottom lol and after just the one use I have fine lines that are gone out at least not noticeable.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does to my hair!</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time today as a clay mask, after spending a fortune on masks in the past I have to say nothing has ever felt like this before, you can feel the mask working, tightening my face and it dries quickly . So far I am very impressed and would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Better than Aztec clay. I saw results immediately. Excellent quality. I used with the rose water. Phenomenal.</li>
    <li> Love the product  Unhappy with the way it is sent out without being sealed... It is a cosmetic item and loose power.  Inside seal which was not sealed is questionable......</li>
    <li> I mix this with organic rose water and it is not too harsh on my sensitive skin.  Felt very refreshing after and pores looked clean.  Next time I plan on steaming my face then applying this for about 12 minutes.  I use mainly on my T zone and chin a little on my face, seems to firm skin slightly.  Cleans pores really good.  With regular use I hope to minimize my pores.</li>
    <li> This rhassoul clay was very soft and gentle on my skin. I mixed it with apple cider vinegar and applied as a mask and also to wash my face. I love it. Bentonite clay was more drying. Rhassoul has a lower ph and I could tell the difference. As a mask it pulsates like bentonite but I feel I works with your skin so too much oil is not taken. I follow with coconut oil to moisturize. I plan to use it to wash my hair.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this I was curious as to what was the difference between that other Indian healing clay (I think I got the name right) and rhassoul clay. So after all my extensive research (Wikipedia, lol) I decided to stick with this one. The say this one is more gentle and rich in mineral properties. I had random break outs because of environmental factors and this helped me stop them, I used this with rosé water. Perfect combination</li>
    <li> I ordered this with the Rose Water per the recommendation of all the reviews. I tried mixing the clay with water to use as shampoo and I either spill it all over because there&#x27;s too much water or there&#x27;s clumps of clay all over my head because I didn&#x27;t use enough water. After I rinse, I used Moroccan oil all over my hair because it&#x27;s a tangly mess and it makes your hair very dry. After I blow dried, my hair was so full of static and heavy that I ended up just putting it in a bun. I showered the next day using regular high-end S&amp;C and my hair still feels like there&#x27;s some sort of paste all over it and like a horse&#x27;s mane. Let me note, normally I have long, thin, normal, shiny, weightless, flowy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell and concept seems great, but apparently I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
    <li> I first heard about this Clay Powder on a post I saw on Allure.com. Being the skincare-obsessed person that I am, I immediately went on a research frenzy to learn what makes this powder so special. This let me to raving reviews on multiple blogs as well as Amazon.  Now some say that you should mix it with rose water, but honestly, I didn&#x27;t feel like ordering that since I can always soothe my skin afterward with my Heritage Rose Water spray (which I love just for the smell).&lt;br /&gt;So I open the jar, and it&#x27;s basically a powdery clay.  I poured a couple of tablespoons of the power into  a foam cup (I had a feeling that it would be difficult to clean the resulting paste out of a glass cup, and I was right) and added a little water (and by little, I mean start with a teaspoon at a time and mix) until I had a paste. I took a plastic spoon, and used the round back of it to apply to my face.  The mask started drying a few minutes later, and the drying experience is interesting. You start to feel your face tightening to the point where it&#x27;s throbbing (but totally bearable). About 10 minutes in, and you literally can&#x27;t move your face.  I let it dry for about 20 minutes, and then proceeded to wash it off.  Washing it off is probably the most annoying part of the process.  The best way I found to wash it off is by splashing my face with warm water until the mask starts to soften up, and then gently wipe it off with my hands and more warm water.  For about 10 minutes after you remove the mask, my face had some red blotches but they soon disappeared.  I was left with squeaky clean skin, most of my blackheads completely gone, and invisible pores.  This mask is amazing.  I highly recommend it, even though it&#x27;s just a little bit of a process (and I hate processes).  I would totally recommend this as a weekly mask.</li>
    <li> I like this product I used it for the first time with aloe vera juice and Moroccan oil. My hair was nice and soft it felt different. It also defend some of my curls except the front. But over all great product</li>
    <li> Leaves me feeling clean. Mixes well with other essential oils and products. Can definitely see me purchasing again. Loved it.</li>
    <li> mixes easily, great for the skin, not drying. I love the product but it is entirely to expensive so I switched to a more economical brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just recently learned about Ghassoul Clay and with all the great reviews I thought I&#x27;d try it out. Living in the south and dealing with humidity really messes with my combination skin. I don&#x27;t really have acne, but it takes nothing for me to get a break out either. When I use this clay mask often, I notice my skin seems to a bit tighter, my poors looks smaller and it helps to keep my skin clear. (In combination with washing of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it in my hair but I couldn&#x27;t really see a difference, but I&#x27;ve only done it once so we&#x27;ll see in the near future. I&#x27;d recommend it for sure as a weekly skin care routine.</li>
    <li> This powder left my hair very detangled and softened after rinsing. However, as my hair dried, the clay in itself (well actually I made a mixture consisting of Greek yogurt, banana puree, honey, olive oil, and the clay) did not serve as a good enough conditioner to keep my hair from returning to its usual dryness, so I followed w/ a moisturizing deep conditioner. My hair did feel really clean after using the clay though, so I think it took better to my deep conditioner. I would just say to be sure to rinse really well! This clay seems to work well against product build up, but for those with hair like mine (4a/4b), I would definitely recommend following up w/ a moisturizing deep conditioner regime. And be prepared, this can get messy!</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Unhappy about the packaging.  The product arrived with the safety seal already broken and the lid scratched up and slightly damaged.  Because the product was shipped in a hard box (which did not appear damaged) with stuffing, it&#x27;s unlikely the damage occurred during shipping - it was sent this way from the supplier.  The product, however, I am very pleased with and it has resolved my acne.  I will continue to use the moroccan ghassoul clay powder, but not from this supplier.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. Had a problem with large pores.  This mask does make diffference in the size of your pores.  I use it once a week and follow up with some grapeseed oil.  I read on one of the reviews to mix with water, lemon juice and a little honey.  That works well for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product I love it</li>
    <li> I like the clay the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price for the weight. I feel as though I could get more bang for my buck else where but for the  convenience of amazon I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Amazing results. My skin looks and feels so renewed and clean and fresher after each use.  I mix worj rose water and 1 drop of tea tree for a hot day or after a hot bath.  Can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This clay has a wondrous texture and therapeutic properties that exceeds all others. This is not Moroccan Red clay, which is very drying. I have used bentonite, kaolin, fuller&#x27;s earth, etc. Nothing compares. Leaves my skin radiant and clears blackheads. Superb!</li>
    <li> Really good product but as stated, it strips the color from my hair so I will not be ordering again for my hair..  However, for those who do not color their hair, it is excellent and is also an excellent facial clay.</li>
    <li> The clay is lovely, comes in a nice container.  I am very used to benonite clay though and this stuff is definitely different.  It is dark brown and slightly granular when wet and has a distinctive smell. Not bad but strong while you are using it, it didn&#x27;t linger at all.</li>
    <li> This works better than bentonite clay as far as shampooing hair. I like to mix a little ACV with witch hazel.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily and messy. This used daily makes my skin look its best ever. I saw a difference after the very first use! Pores are smaller, skin is smoother and tighter, and more even toned. I mix it with coconut oil - 1 tsp of clay, 1/3 tsp coconut oil, and enough water to make it a thin mask, so I can use it daily without drying the skin out too much.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. The delivery was very quick too. Got it in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Omg! It smells like they dug up dirt from the backyard creek bed. I saw no improvement like the premade mud packs. It dried like concrete and was horrible to remove.  Chunky flakes that ripped at my skin and flaked into my eyes. I hated it!</li>
    <li> Liked it at first.  It is very harsh and makes skin very red.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.  Description makes it sound like magic it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried to product yet as I have to research a little more on how to use it effectively.  So far, it is great.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best clay facial masks you could ever use. I add lemon juice to mine until the texture is smooth and mouse like. I leave it on for 20 minutes. I have sensitive skin so I get red patches after removing it. They disappear after 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is way clearer and my pores pretty much disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 2013 Update:&lt;br /&gt;I use this clay with apple cider vinegar in the warm months for my oily skin. It completely gets rid of my blackheads.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it. It really made my skin red and dry.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!! It dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this Moroccan clay powder for the first time and so far I&#x27;m very happy with the quality. I mix it with the rose water (same brand) and apply it on my face as a mask. This combination leaves my skin looking fresh and soft.</li>
    <li> I use this product as shampoo. If you mix it with water and a couple of drops of jojoba oil it works wonders!</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Makes skin soft and supple. This seller has a fabulous product at a great price. Highly recommended. Fast ship!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite clays. It is an intense experience - you can FEEL it working. (Your face may redden a bit with the increased circulation, so be sure you have 30 minutes after rinsing to let it calm down.) It&#x27;s quickly replacing Aztec and Redmond in my routine. I recommend mixing it with a hydrosol (flower water) like rose. Currently, I mix it with the lavender &amp; calendula tonic from Willow Rose Body Care.</li>
    <li> This makes a wonderful masque.  My skin feels so soft after I rinse it off.  Nice for drying-up any oil, blisters, zits and removing blackheads.  I mix mine with rose water.</li>
    <li> Great to make my clay shampoo...</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It leaves my hair and skin as soft as butter.  I will be reordering it again.  It feels like an amazing conditioning treatment for you hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this product as a cheap alternative to Lerosett. It was okay but it didn&#x27;t match the effectiveness of the Lerosett product. I would not recommend this to someone with the same motive as I had in purchasing it. Aside from that, I think for anyone with other intentions with ghassoul clay will find this brand as decent quality and economical buy.</li>
    <li> I used rose water to make a paste and put it on my face to remove blackheads the other day. After a few minutes I felt my face was tighter and also felt increased blood circulation. This one time application removed blackheads and my skin felt so supple. Increadible product</li>
    <li> Arrived early. I mixed it with the Elma and Sana 100% Pure Moroccan Rose Water and left the mask on my face until dry. Washes off with warm water and leaves skin very smooth and with a healthy glow. A little goes a long way, too. Has some good detox properties also.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. Helps clear up my psoriasis when used on a weekly basis. Also an excellent value.</li>
    <li> This is a really cool masque for your skin, it mixes into a really soft and heavenly paste. It is also good in your hair if youre into going with the no shampoo method. I shall buy it once again</li>
    <li> I heard great things about this but sadly it did not work for me. I used it on my face to help prevent acne breakouts, but acne got worse as a result. It may work for other people and it might be good for hair, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I used it with the rose water from the same company. My skin feels amazing. Love it!</li>
    <li> When first applied (I mixed with rosewater) my hair felt dry, almost stripped, but, once I rinsed it I could not believe how soft and silky my hair felt. I used it also on my face. Once I rinsed my skin was visibly clearer. I will purchase both products again. I will try mixing a light oil for the hair mask for the next use.</li>
    <li> Tried this for the first time as a mask. I mixed it with rosewater and WOW!! My skin felt so tight and incredibly soft after! I have oily skin and I felt it controlled the oil as well. Will continue using as a weekly mask. Highly recommend it. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! Totally cleared up my face and made my skin feel amazing instantly. I mixed it with the Rose water I ordered from this same Co. I am picky about my products. This is the best clay mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This makes a perfect base for any beauty mask. You can mix if with anything to get an even more beneficial mask. I mix mine with honey and tumeric. I have super oily skin.</li>
    <li> I use this as a face wash it&#x27;s a part of a process I do to help with my box scars on my face. I add baking soda and few drops of lemon and it is amazing. Buyer for life. My pores shrunk within 4 days. I have acne prone and oily skin and today 1 month later it is balancing out my skin and I&#x27;m in awe.</li>
    <li> Yes I do love this product and makes your skin feel silky smooth, and it tightens as well, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> I like it and I think it&#x27;s good for anyone with acne prone skin (like myself). I keep it on for 30-1hr each time. The only thing is that I have sensitive skin and it leaves my face VERY red for an entire 24 hours after using it so my recommendation would be to put it on when you aren&#x27;t expecting to go out the next day.</li>
    <li> I love it and it arrived on time ! Thank You</li>
    <li> Love this clay. I&#x27;ve been using bentonite clay for my hair for a few months now and this is much better. It wasn&#x27;t messy for me, easy to rinse and my hair looks and feels amazing after. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> This Clay is amazing! I am so pleased. I used it for my hair and face. I loved the results on my hair. My curls were POPPIN! My skin felt great after too. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this so far! Works better for me than the Indian Healing Clay. I mixed this new powder with some organic aloe vera gel and it works beautifully. I thought I might have to mix in some water for fear it would come out to thick, but I got the consistency very close to the Lerosett I use to buy. I didn&#x27;t get that dry, burning feeling I did with the Indian Clay.</li>
    <li> I got this after reading reviews and suggestions on how to use it on hair. So I took some of this powder, mixed it with rose water and added quite a few drops of argan oil. It dried out my hair immediately, but I wasn&#x27;t worried since I read about that on the reviews. However, even after washing it out, my hair still felt dry and damaged. I have not used it since, and the jar is just sitting there collecting dust on the shelf.</li>
    <li> The real deal rhassoul red clay. Apply it thinly on your face, as it is strong and can sting. Great for a hair mask as well.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!! FAST SHIPPING!!</li>
    <li> This product is very effective, gentle and amazing. Has completely kept acne at bay without drying the skin. I also love that I can use it knowing that what I put on my body and face is completely natural. I pre mix it with a little bit of water and argon oil and....Bam! I have a face body wash supply for a few weeks. Definitely worth the price, as it is also very economical.</li>
    <li> i love this clay mask:)</li>
    <li> i really do love this product. after one use i felt like my blemishes went away. only down fall is that its very messy</li>
    <li> You can mix a little bit in my hand with some water and get whatever consistency you wish. Does not dry skin or hair.</li>
    <li> Good natural product for your skin.</li>
    <li> Not as good as AZTEC clay</li>
    <li> amazing results--really brightens skin</li>
    <li> My only complaint was that when I opened my box half the container was gone because the jar wasn&#x27;t closed properly. But amazon took care of me and I was all good.  I mixed mine with aloe vera juice, rosehip seed oil, ylang ylang, nettle, and linden.  Yes it will most likely dry out your hair because the clay will suck out all oils, dirts, and whatnots but if you follow up with a deep conditioner your hair should be fine.</li>
    <li> This product gives a nice deep cleaning and toning. No dryness afterward. 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Use this for occassionally washing my hair with.  Works great!!</li>
    <li> Great hair detangler! I have fractal zigzag 4c hair hair that can get single strand knots easily. This stuff just melts it like butter!  Also defines curls and softens hair.  I mix it with milk, honey, olive oil, and argan oil. Lavender essential oil for scent smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> After researching clays for masks I purchased this product and I am glad I did.  Rhassoul clay is not drying and it contains minerals and trace elements that help the skin. It removes toxins, impurities and dead skin cells.  Before I used the clay I washed my face. Then, in a small bowl I mixed a teaspoon of the clay with enough rose hydrosol to make a paste, smoothed it on and let it dry. I washed it off with warm water and a washcloth. After using this mask, my face had a glow and looked clearer and more youthful.  When I run out I will order it again.</li>
    <li> As a skincare \\&quot;junkie\\&quot;, I would say that this is a good mask in general except for the fact that it is messy to apply and remove.  It will discolor/stain your washcloth when you remove it and chances are it will spill when you are mixing it with water or applying it to your face.  It is also very drying and will make your skin feel a bit gritty.  Using a toner or facial mist afterward may reduce the feeling of residue on the skin.  This is the best moroccan mud that I have used so far comparing it to other brands that claim it is imported from Morocco.  A little bit definately goes a long way so it is a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff!  I mix with Thayer Rose Petal witch hazel and use as a facial mask weekly.  You can actually see the mask pulling your face taut.  Rinsing off is a laborious affair, but when you are finished...nice smooth skin.  I follow with argan oil and my face feel delicious!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for those who prefer the products on their face to be of a more natural origin.  Seller was fine, quick delivery and packaged well!</li>
    <li> everything okay, thanks a lot</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel very clean and soft. I mix it with rose water and put on my face until it dries and then wash it off.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping &amp; The Product Is Fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought this item after reading all of the positive reviews, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! The Moroccan Ghassoul Lava Clay Powder leaves your face feeling soft without over-drying it. Since this particular clay does run a little pricey, I like to mix it with French Green Powder. The combination of the two leaves my face feeling soft and glowing!</li>
    <li> Good clay powder.  I use it for hair definition</li>
    <li> Amazing mask. Brightens my face after every use.</li>
    <li> Love this, better than bentonite clay, pricey though</li>
    <li> I used it and my face felt so smooth afterwards.  I will continue to use it on my face.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a little messy but it works wonders for your face. You can feel it taking all of the impurities out, and leaves my skin the cleanest its ever felt. A little lotion after washing off and it feels great.</li>
    <li> Dried out my hair and didn&#x27;t expect the result.  I should have done more research on the product. I will try again since I have the jar</li>
    <li> I use clay instead of shampoo to cleanse and detox my hair. I mix rhassoul with kaolin clay with honey, olive oil, argan oil, and green tea and apply it as a mask. It works great and keeps my coils moisturized and healthy.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and hair. My pores appeared smaller and my scalp felt clean and not stripped.</li>
    <li> A wonderful, inexpensive clay mask that really does the job! I can&#x27;t recommend this any more. The shipping was fast and cheap, and the product itself has become a staple in my family.</li>
    <li> I am a straight NATURAL CHICK and i love DIY projects. Watching YouTube I found that NAPTURAL85 gave a great tutorial on how to DIY a MUD cleansing shampoo.(Great way to save $$$) I purchased this product at a MORE than reasonable price and I received it within 1 week. After adding my ingredients: (Argan oil,Rose hips oil, Nettle&#x27;s oil, Linden FLWR oil, Ylang Ylang oil, Aloe vera juice (@ ROOM TEMP) and the Ghassoul Pwdr, I blended the mixture to a smooth consistency and applied mix to my hair. After rinsing the product from my hair I noticed how my curl definition was enhanced. I had no clumps(residue) or build-up and my hair was soooo soft, clean and bouncy! I will be purchasing more of this product for sure!!. I was able to get 5 washes from this 8oz jar (for me this is 5 MONTHS of use !) I am TOTALLY SOLD!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this for masks and use it with the rose water!  buy with confidence.  Really fast shipping</li>
    <li> Id rather use bentonite Healing clay. This is a small amount of product for the price. The benefits of this product does not outweigh bentonite clay (plus, you get more for your money).</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Great for hair and face masks.</li>
    <li> seems to work well. Have only used it once.</li>
    <li> worked great for my pore.but If you have sensitive skin like me, you will likely to have breakout.I am planning to use it for my hair since Its too risky to use it to my face.</li>
    <li> Makes my face look and feel great especially when coupled with rose water.  Also, a little goes a long way.  Each of my mini facials9which cover my face and neck)  would probably warrant maybe 2 tablespoons of this stuff.</li>
    <li> Before you write a review on this product, I decided some time to test it. Of all the ways I like to use Moroccan Ghassoul Lava Clay Powder leaves as a face mask. I have no problem skin, but as every woman wants to look better and younger. I really like the result I get after applying the mask, I want to try other products of this series, but from the Moroccan Ghassoul Lava Clay Powder leaves I will use in the future!</li>
    <li> The product clears your skin of acne and oils. It leaves your skin soft but also very dry. I woukd highly recommend moisturizing your skin afterwards.</li>
    <li> Began to use this after I ran across a blog commenting that they used this clay to clean their face. It doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oils and is really gentle. Having really sensitive skin, I was interested, but hesitant.  I love using natural clays for beauty applications. But they also make me red where I applied it. I use this clay in the AM and PM each day, and my skin has never looked better. It&#x27;s been a long road to &#x27;no makeup wearing&#x27; comfort level and I&#x27;m finally there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;I mix up 1 tbsp in a plastic bag with about as much distilled water.(important to use distilled to allow for full benefit) I use plastic because the natural negative charge of the clay (this is what helps to detox the skin) is cancelled out if you use metal. (This came from research, but it seems to be a universal knowledge about clays). I mush the clay around with the water until it&#x27;s all saturated. I then push the clay to corner, pushing it slightly back from the very corner, cut the tip off and squeeze it into a glass container. ( Think a pastry bag, if that helps. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:  I keep it a fairly thick consistency, since all I do it wet my face with warm water, and apply a thin coat with a makeup brush. The kind I used to use to apply liquid foundation. It works like a charm.  I then close up my container, so it won&#x27;t dry out, and rinse my brush. This is long enough for the clay to &#x27;clean&#x27; my face. Then I rinse it off with warm water again.  If I&#x27;m having some skin troubles, I&#x27;ll leave it until it dries, or until I&#x27;m impatient. Works like a charm. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments, and they didn&#x27;t even know I had changed my routine!  After 10 years of rosacea and adult acne, I&#x27;m now happy to wear bare skin and have my face glow with health.</li>
    <li> I just made the transition to no-poo (not using shampoo to wash your hair) For the first 6 weeks I was using just baking soda to wash my hair, and this was making my hair coarse and waxy. After doing some research I discovered washing with Ghassoul clay, so I decided to try this product out. I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks now and I am in love with how it makes my hair feel. I mix the clay with honey, apple cider vinegar and water to make a paste that cleans my hair just as well- if not better- than traditional chemical laden shampoos. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is trying no-poo or just wants to deep clean their hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a dream come true. I am using it to wash my hair instead of baking soda and my hair is SO soft and silky. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Love this clay powder. I just mix this with a small amount of water and wash my face with it. Works great! Leaves my skin soft and clean. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is my second order so you know I must love it!  I mixed mine with a little morracan oil before applying to my hair.</li>
    <li> I just recently found out about this and thought I would give it a try. I also purchased rose water from this same company to mix with it. It mixed very nicely and was easy to apply. My face looked and felt better even after one use! I have pretty normal skin but my skin looked amazing afterwards! I am telling everyone they need to use this!! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Ok so I have waited a while to review this product. This is my first review for any product on Amazon ever and let me tell you, this stuff if the TRUTH!! They say the truth will set you free and this stuff has set me free from the bondage of breakouts and large pores.  Now I use this stuff in combination with Aveeno products and Olay, but I do believe this is a key factor to why my skin has been doing so well. I never really had acne per se, but every month I would breakout will ALOT of tiny bumps all over my face, and then I would have to work to get rid of them. Also over time, my pores began to get noticeably LARGE, and I never has this issue before. However, since I started using this product, no joke, my pores have shrunken tremendously, and I don&#x27;t get those breakouts anymore and my skin just glows and is so smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is how I use the product:&lt;br /&gt;I use 1-2 times biweekly, I take about 1TBSP of Clay and mix with RAW apple cider vinegar, and rose water (or regular water if I run out). Sometimes, I will add some essential oils like lavender and rosehip oil, and then I put this mixture on a freshly washed face. I then let it sit on my face until it dries. You will feel this product just pull all of the bad stuff out of your face, and is definitely  the most intense mask I have used. However once you rinse it off you skin is so smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, its just amazing! Definitely give it a try! Although if you have very sensitive skin, this mask might be too much, but other than that, it&#x27;s just down right awesome!!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and makes a great hair mask with olive oil.</li>
    <li> Mixed this with rose water and it left my face really soft.</li>
    <li> really good product, no irritation, smooth, skin feels rejuvenated after use, product came on time, recommend, I am over 50 y.o and its not drying</li>
    <li> I loved this clay for a face &amp; body mask. I mix it with apple cider vinegar, rose water, and smear it on. It dries fast and makes everything soft, clean, and tight. I tried it on my hair after seeing that others use it as part of their no-poo regimen. Sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me. I saw on you-tube that a lot of African-American women use it on their hair with great sucess, and although I have the kinky curls, I am a white girl and maybe the texture is just different. I can&#x27;t say that it dried my hair out, it felt more like i had glue in my hair. I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through it or my wide tooth comb. Also my hair wouldn&#x27;t curl, it was like it was all stuck together. I will do more research to see it i need to do something different in regards to my hair and update as necessary.</li>
    <li> makes a great face scrub</li>
    <li> I have been using this Ghassoul clay on my hair and I love it. It really puts moisture back into my hair. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I used it and my face was pulsating ( in a good way). It left my face smooth and took away all the gunk out of my pores. I mixed this with rose water and a few drops of rose oil. OMG! It was wonderful. I will say that the rose water is expensive and regular water is just fine too. It had my skin dewy and looking good after just 1 use. Use a good moisturizer with this product if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  It arrived on time and was exactly what i expected.  I use it as a facial mask a couple times a week.  It definitely smooths my face, calms underlying inflammation, and diminished the appearance of pores.  I mix my powder with distilled water, rosemary essential oil, and lavendar essential oil.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! It is extremely finely ground and easy to use. The effect on my skin is great, very smooth application and soft and smooth results. Those who would like to have at home spa, this product is a winner.</li>
    <li> Love it! If you have dry skin, make sure to moisturize after, but works great</li>
    <li> Eh.:/ A lot of people were raving about how this is great for hair but it&#x27;s just okay. I think it&#x27;s realllly good on your face. I use it about once every 2-3 weeks on my face and my skin feels super soft.</li>
