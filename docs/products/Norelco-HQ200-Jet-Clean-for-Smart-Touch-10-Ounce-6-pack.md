<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cleans my razor perfectly</li>
    <li> It works like a miracle in cleaning the shaver.  It takes all the wiskers out of the shaver.</li>
    <li> Product was what I expected. Shipped on time. Will purchase more when needed.</li>
    <li> I had tried to purchase Norelco Jet Cleaner for my newest Norelco Electric Razor. I used the old cleaner purchased with the razor for about a year because I couldn&#x27;t find a retail outlet that carried it.  I finally went on line and found 6 pack of Jet Cleaner at Amazon. Thank goodness it is still available.I will be back to buy more before too long.    Tom Bryan,  South Carolina</li>
    <li> so much easier to buy a case then to hunt for this cleaner at the store and hope that they have it when you need it.. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> good product but expensive. Best price I could find.</li>
    <li> This product is a very good value as it not only cleans but also lubricates the shaver heads.[[ASIN:B000PJBSSY Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution (Case of 6)]]</li>
    <li> After using the Norelco 1280X/42 for a month now, I made it my primary razor.  The 3D features help contour my face and it really cuts closer than a 5-blade razor, especially when using shaving cream.  However, when I try shaving my neck it tears my skin badly.  I don&#x27;t know why this happens (even when I apply little to no pressure).  This results in me using my 5-blade razor to prevent razor burn on my neck.  The Jet cleaning system is really nice to have but not a must since you could use the faucet to clean out the hairs.  I&#x27;m keeping this product and I do recommend it.    Pros: Ultra close shave, especially when using shaving cream      : Contours the face real well      : Able to use while taking a shower      : Single charge lasts for weeks    Cons: Tears up my neck      : Need the Jet Clean System or Stand to charge the Razor      : \\&quot;Must\\&quot; unplug the charger from the wall once the Razor finished recharging      : Sideburn trimmer is undersized (less than .75\\&quot; wide)</li>
    <li> Norelco wanted to charge more for shipping than the cost of two bottles. I got six bottles from Amazon for about the price of four from Norelco.</li>
    <li> Hubby likes and recommends ...</li>
    <li> Works with the Norelco Jet Clean system to effortlessly clean the SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor. Keeps my razor smelling fresh and working perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great deal!  I like buying this stuff in bulk so I don&#x27;t have to look for it every month.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  Shaves are easier and closer using it. I use a Norelco rotary and this helps improve the closeness of the shave.</li>
    <li> I bought these about a year ago... about time I got around to writing this review. The Norelco HQ-200 product is great, but this seller is not. Despite the picture, the product actually came out-of-box with no original packaging of any kind. They were also the tall bottles, not the shorter round bottles, as pictured. These are Cool Breeze scented, which is not indicated within the product description or in the picture for this product (because it&#x27;s the wrong photo). I didn&#x27;t want Cool Breeze, and I didn&#x27;t like the smell. Worst of all, two of the bottles were not fully sealed and got all over the inside of the brown box they were shipped in and all over the rest of the bottles. Great product, but bad seller. So to sum it up: inaccurate photo + inaccurate description + out-of-box items sold as &#x27;new&#x27; + poor packaging + broken seals + wet and sticky &#x3D; 1 star. That&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
    <li> The product received is exactly as advertised, the product arrived on schedule, the product came well packed and everything worked out. When I have to buy will choose this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Purchased for the man of my life, it is the brand he uses, the price was good. Works very well.</li>
    <li> We find it is so much easier to buy the Jet Cleaner in bulk on the Amazon sight then at our local stores. The price is not to bad either.</li>
    <li> This company sells distressed merchandise as new. The bottles did not have outside packaging.  The labels were scratched on the bottles and the date of manufacturing was removed. I recommend finding your cleaning solution at another source.</li>
    <li> Great and quick service!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works, what else can I say.</li>
    <li> Great price and service</li>
    <li> I gave this as a Christmas present along with the Norelco Smart Touch razor it&#x27;s made to work with and the recipient was very pleased to get it.</li>
    <li> If you own a electric razor this is something you need, raadar runs smoother and quieter.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. My only wish is that I could get this in a four pack instead of a six pack.  You can&#x27;t drink it after all!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product with my Norelco shavers for many years. Have always been satisfied.    My current razor model is the self-cleaning type. It works well.</li>
    <li> Have used for years, and still as advertised, but too expensive.</li>
    <li> A good clean shave for a good price. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great price and value</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised.  I remove the cutting head mechanism from my Norelco razor and soak the complete mechanism in the cleaner solution.  I occaisionally agitate the mechanism while it soaks.  I then remove the mechanism and rinse it in warm water and then air dry until the next day.  After the mechanism is completely dry, I spray Norelco lubricant on the cutting heads and let the razor run for a short time before shaving. The solution and this process seems to work very well.</li>
    <li> Good price, about an 8 month supply.  Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Clean your razor daily for smoother shaving. Change the fluid every two weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the solution smells good too.</li>
    <li> When it arrived, I figured it couldn&#x27;t all be in there.  But upon opening, I realized how they packaged it.  Genius.  How come the others I&#x27;ve ordered these from didn&#x27;t do it this way.  Love it, will buy again!</li>
    <li> it cleaned my razor bottom and razor - if any one that has a electric razor, they should buy this.</li>
    <li> I know this is supposed to be for the product but watch out for this company, PresentsForYou. Don&#x27;t do business with them. They can&#x27;t be trusted. They don&#x27;t reply to messages or have any real contact information on the company. They have canceled orders before in order to price gouge. Then claimed they were out of stock on the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works great &amp; you can even get it cheaper in a 3pk through Amazon or a 6pk from Buy-It-Now. Either place is much safer to do business with!!!</li>
    <li> Got a new razor for Christmas and it included one bottle of Jet Clean.&lt;br /&gt;The six pack price was fantastic so I purchased one.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Works well for Norelco electric razor and is a great product for the price. I looked elsewhere and this product is difficult to find.</li>
    <li> Great deal, have multiple razors in our home that need cleaning with the HQ2oo for over 4 years. Product does a great job of keeping razors clean and running correctly.  Love the price and  packaging of products. I cannot find this readily in local stores,  so glad I can get it this easily on line. Wish it was available for auto order/delivery.</li>
    <li> we live in a small town and its nearly impossible to find this product. my husband needs it for his razor cleaning purposes and I was very pleased to be able to order it on amazon. the 6 bottles should last us a good while, but at least I know where we can get more product when needed.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to have a good supply for my new razor. Once again i turn to amazon for a good price.</li>
    <li> Great for more Norelco shaver head, keeps it clean and lubricated for a great close shave.  It is really good to use after each shave in the cleaning device that came with my shaver.</li>
    <li> At this time is very good for me. Thank you</li>
    <li> Wish the price was a bit better but it is exactly what I asked for.</li>
    <li> If you use a Norelco electric razor; then this is a must have to keep it clean and efficient.  Really does a great cleaning job on my Norelco.</li>
    <li> This is a very good cleaning pack.  It is the actual Philips cleaner, not a secondary market item.  Came quickly and was as promised.</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco razor with the cleaning system and use this to keep the razor in great shape.  It still runs good and I have only replaced the head one time.</li>
    <li> good stuff.  Have the newest style razor and this is the correct solution for it.  Plus, having it on hand allows for proper cleaning.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, Does the job we needed it for.</li>
    <li> This set of cleaning liquid is awosome. However, I discovered these look prety old because they are dusty whem I recieved items.</li>
    <li> Got a good price on these so I picked them up so they are here when I need to change the cleaner in my unit.  A great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> it came all sealed and straight away.  The lotion is need to wah the grit away frome the shaver and keep it running.</li>
    <li> I have an automatic charging and cleaning razor holding system and go through a bottle of cleaner about every 5 weeks. The price is good when you buy this in bulk.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband and he couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  They really need to put this on the package.  My husband has some sensitivity to certain perfumes and lotions or any type of shaving solutions.</li>
    <li> The product i have used before and my razor cleaning station requires it. This was the best deal I found to purchase. Only issue i found  with this was poor packing by the seller. Item was not in a box but rolled and taped into a bag of some sort. Product was not protected and some leaked out.</li>
    <li> Great Product &amp; Price Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> that was what was sugested/required to use in the jet clean machine I have used this product before and acheived good rusults</li>
    <li> I bought my boyfriend norelco 1280XCC sensoTouch and he LoVES it!!!! But the cleaning solution runs out quick, so I bought him a set of these and it has been almost half a year and he haven&#x27;t ask for a new set, so  I assume he still has some left. :)</li>
    <li> Keeps my shaver clean and smelling fresh.  I change the fluid in the head cleaner about every two weeks.  You can get about two full changes out of each bottle, so one bottle is good for about a month.  A six-pack ought to last about 6 months.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this &amp;#34;Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean for Smart Touch, 10... product. It helps keep my electric shaver working properly and lubricates the three razors as well.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my shaver</li>
    <li> Finally found the product online. Looked everywhere locally. Does a great job on the shaver.</li>
    <li> This product gives a really good cleansing for the Phillips Norelco shaver,  my husband uses this in the &amp;#34;reservoir&amp;#34; of the cleaner/charger.  He does this after about every five shaves and when the reservoir runs low, he adds more of the cleanser.  Monthly, he completely cleans out the reservoir and fills it with fresh cleanser.  We have been unable to find this at our local Walmart, Target, and Publix as it seems Norelco has now gone to some sort of cleaning cartridge which may not be compatible with the razor he has, so we stocked up on this liquid cleanser on amazon.com rather than being forced to buy a new and expensive razor.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleaner since I purchased my Norelco shaver three years ago and it still shaves as well as it did the first day!</li>
    <li> This solution works well with the jet clean devise. I like to shave with my Norelco in the shower and this device leaves the whole unit like new every time.</li>
    <li> keeps my razer well  cleaan</li>
    <li> I finally got the products one month after order with 3 times delivery inquiry e-mails.&lt;br /&gt;Packing box was a kind of shock! Tape sealing was half opened. And all the naked plastic box were covered by black dirts.&lt;br /&gt;(I guess there was thermal exposure during the shipping and all the label has been stripped-off and hanging)&lt;br /&gt;Even more, 2 bottles were seriously leaked(half filled) already due to improper packing.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of time, energy and money.&lt;br /&gt;Even one star is waste for the rate this seller.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as described!</li>
    <li> Cost was great thank you</li>
    <li> Good price, I got it fast and no problems. I will buy these again when I need more. I don&#x27;t want to write this review anymore</li>
