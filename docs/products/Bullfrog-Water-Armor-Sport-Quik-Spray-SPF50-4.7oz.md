<li> The pump spray works better for me than the aerosol, but it is impossible to find at local stores.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
<li> Went on so dry</li>
<li> Does the job without making a mess.</li>
<li> A little pricey or I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
<li> Once it is on, I hardly know I am wearing it.  </li>
<li> , the plastic melting was just a little unsettling.</li>
<li> A lot disappointed in this considering I am leaving tomorrow for vacation.</li>
<li> The bottle was also very dirty and it was covered in sticky residue!</li>
<li> This Company is horrible!</li>

    <li> I have used Bullfrog Pump Spray sunscreen for several years (eight or ten?) and have tried others, but found nothing else that works as well for me.  It goes on easily, and dries quickly after I spread it around a bit.  Once it is on, I hardly know I am wearing it.  Without sunscreen I burn in a matter of minutes.  With Bullfrog Water Armor Sport I do not burn even after several hours of yard work or fun at the lake.  The pump spray works better for me than the aerosol, but it is impossible to find at local stores.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff..!!</li>

    <li> I burn very easy and I applied this yesterday as I felt my skin starting to burn.  Went on so dry I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was protected or not, but I was.  Didn&#x27;t burn at all.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen will not spray.</li>
    <li> We love this sunscreen the best because it is not continuous spray and works great.  Disney World tested and approved.</li>
    <li> This is a product my Dermatologist told me to use.</li>
    <li> Seems to keep Mosquitos off but after using my iPhone I noticed it ERODED/MELTED my plastic iPhone case.  It looked like acid was rubbed on it and the plastic was flaking off in my hand.  I like the mosquito protection, the plastic melting was just a little unsettling.</li>

    <li> Best sun screen ever.</li>
    <li> Works well for this white skin... only beware when using on a windy day. . .</li>
    <li> I blame me for now checking more tborough my on this item but the line picture is not what is for sale!!  I know when I clicked on it the picture was the lotion for the face. A lot disappointed in this considering I am leaving tomorrow for vacation.</li>
    <li> I do not know if the sunscreen was good or not.  However, the nozzle on both the bottles I received did not work.  If I purchased it again, I would get the cream version.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Doesn&#x27;t stink. Does the job without making a mess. After all my little skin cancers I carry a bottle with me most days in case I may have to spend more than 10 minutes in the sun.</li>
