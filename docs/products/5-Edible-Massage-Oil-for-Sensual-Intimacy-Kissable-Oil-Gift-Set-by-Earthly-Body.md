      <li>We love this.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d probably prefer to use these more for aroma therapy than a snack.</li>
      <li>Just ok.  </li>
      <li>Me and my girlfriend enjoyed it</li>
      <li>Nothing sexy about that.</li>
      <li>Although the product smells delicious, I can&#x27;t say the same for</li>
      <li>We really like this oil, not overbearing in smell or in taste, just right,  it was enjoyed by both of us!!!</li>
      <li>so i can&#x27;t say first hand how they worked, but the bride loved the gift</li>
      <li>These all smell pretty good.  </li>
      <li>More scented than flavored, and the watermelon scent was almost overwhelmingly strong.  </li>
      <li>That simple and because I was unsure what would be good, the sample pack was good for me.</li>
      <li>Kind of taste like ChapStick with a hint of fruity flavor but for what it is it was worth purchasing</li>
      <li>Spills easily.</li>
      <li>it spreads and absorbs easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy sensation.</li>
      <li>The application is smooth.  </li>
      <li>The oils feel silky smooth, and do not leave a sticky residue.</li>
      <li>smooth.</li>
      <li>Only conplaint is that the oils do not taste as they smell but its not a big deal because she was happy ans that made me happy</li>
      <li>Once I am able to put the various oils to use, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have a favorite and will order as needed.</li>
      <li>Great texture, but not very tasty.  </li>
      <li>I used it on myself and my boyfriend kept telling me how sweet I tasted.</li>
      <li>Not a bad seller but ICK on the product.  </li>
      <li>I really like this massage oil lets me have a lot of fun!!</li>
      <li>smell only, dont actually taste like anything, which is perfect.</li>
      <li>The smell and flavor was mild and i will use it again.</li>
      <li>Most smell very nice, the cherry smells too sweet for me &amp; I have never liked grape</li>
      <li>Smaller than expected but are nice quality and smell great.</li>
      <li>Very crisp.</li>
      <li>the items very delivered very quickly.</li>
      <li>I really do not have a good review for them.</li>
      <li>Actually no taste at all all though they smell nice, but if they say edible</li>
      <li>Excellent choice when you want to see how the other aroma&#x27;s work and how well you will like them before getting larger quanitites</li>
      <li>Same as the big bottles and were a great give away at my party</li>
      <li>Would like to have a flip top bottle cover with a smaller opening.</li>
      <li>We both enjoyed the experience... now testing different flavors and playing:  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say how they worked but do be aware they don&#x27;t come in a box.</li>
      <li>I found these massage oils to be exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve used two so far, and are saving the others for special occasions.</li>
      <li>The scent of the fruit filled the room...not overpowering, but pretty obvious.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t taste as the fruit they have in the label, it&#x27;s pure oil taste</li>
      <li>As it is, it&#x27;s a screw top with a wide mouth opening.</li>
      <li>The vanilla one smells like real cotton candy.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and arrived as promised.</li>
      <li>Not so much for head.</li>
      <li>They taste like nothing and just cheap overall.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re looking for, then I&#x27;d recommend this product to you.</li>
      <li>HAHA.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t really taste that much like anything though.</li>
      <li>Only issue is that it is hard to pour and spills very easily, but other than that it was great.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really do not have a good review for them. They smell good. That&#x27;s about it!</li>
    <li> Not a bad seller but ICK on the product.  I want taste &amp; a some heat/tingling.</li>
    <li> Artificial smell and taste, greasy, of questionable origin. Perhaps homemade?  No ingredients or manufacture listed.  Avoid.</li>
    <li> We love this.  Non-sticky and taste great!  Good for a candle lit relaxing experience.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and arrived as promised. A+++++</li>
    <li> It was eveything I expected it to be, no over powering.  The smell and flavor was mild and i will use it again.</li>
    <li> Same as the big bottles and were a great give away at my party</li>
    <li> just a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Not the best taste and not the best lube won&#x27;t buy again but a fun experience for me and my girl.</li>
    <li> Most smell very nice, the cherry smells too sweet for me &amp; I have never liked grape so no comment on that one. The vanilla &amp; strawberry are my favorites. They smell fabulous, there isn&#x27;t really much taste to them, but it isn&#x27;t a bad flavor either. They stay slick for long enough to actually use and didn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.</li>
    <li> These smelled so artificial and sickly sweet. Also, since they say edible, I expected them to have a flavor. They were completely tasteless, which is better than tasting bad, but still disappointing.</li>
    <li> Was amazing! My girlfriend and i enjoyed the smoothness and pleasant aroma of each. Only conplaint is that the oils do not taste as they smell but its not a big deal because she was happy ans that made me happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the oils.  Nice consistency, nice flavors, etc.  But the bottles are not great for use in the dark.  A better &amp;#34;controlled pour&amp;#34; would be helpful.</li>
    <li> [NSFW] Got this to attempt to make massages more enjoyable, as well as oral activities. The smell is much more pleasant than the taste, but still not bad. Great oil for massages.</li>
    <li> smooth. a good selection to try.</li>
    <li> Although the product smells delicious, I can&#x27;t say the same for it&#x27;s taste. I also thought the bottles were going to be bigger than what they were. You also have to be very careful when unscrewing the cap.</li>
    <li> I really like this massage oil lets me have a lot of fun!!</li>
    <li> I found these massage oils to be exactly what I was looking for. I love them and so does my wife.</li>
    <li> I was expecting these to be flavored as well, but I think that was my fault. These oils are Awesome. They leave your skin reaaallly soft. And they smell SO good. The vanilla one smells like real cotton candy. All of the oils smell like the actual thing. Except for the grape. But its the good kind of grape scent. Very crisp. Overall, I definitely reccomend these for a relaxing night with your lover. Not so much for head. HAHA.</li>
    <li> Good product but wish there was a flip cap instead of screwing it off..</li>
    <li> We really like this oil, not overbearing in smell or in taste, just right,  it was enjoyed by both of us!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I was curious. That simple and because I was unsure what would be good, the sample pack was good for me. Once I am able to put the various oils to use, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have a favorite and will order as needed. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the there are 5 one ounce bottles which makes it a little expensive. But if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re looking for, then I&#x27;d recommend this product to you. Good assortment.</li>
    <li> I would never buy these again.  They taste like nothing and just cheap overall.</li>
    <li> I love the way these oils feel, and my wife loves the smells! We&#x27;ve used two so far, and are saving the others for special occasions. The oils feel silky smooth, and do not leave a sticky residue. They haven&#x27;t stained my bedding, and the scent showers away (which is good when I don&#x27;t want to smell like watermelon at work). Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Only bad thing is I wanted more out of the bottles</li>
    <li> 3 stars translates to &amp;#34;it&#x27;s Ok&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s the most i can say.  What you get is 4 (or is it 5) little bottles that will shock you if you form an expectation based on the picture which looks like big bottles.  Also, i don&#x27;t taste anything!??  Overall it&#x27;s good in the end, not sticky or greasy and you get 2-3 applications per bottle so i guess it&#x27;s a good value in the end.</li>
    <li> I only used one of them so far.  It&#x27;s nice.  I didn&#x27;t think so, but my wife said it was warm going on...a nice detail.  The scent of the fruit filled the room...not overpowering, but pretty obvious.  Tasted ok also...I&#x27;d probably prefer to use these more for aroma therapy than a snack.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift so I can&#x27;t say how they worked but do be aware they don&#x27;t come in a box. They are just loose.</li>
    <li> Would like to have a flip top bottle cover with a smaller opening. As it is, it&#x27;s a screw top with a wide mouth opening. You need two hands.</li>
    <li> Nasty taste... Actually no taste at all all though they smell nice, but if they say edible I would they they at lest would taste somewhat like it&#x27;s suppose to. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but are nice quality and smell great. 10/10 will buy again.</li>
    <li> the items very delivered very quickly. I like all of them. The smells are good and the product is not too oily or sticky. it spreads and absorbs easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy sensation.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of these oils.  The application is smooth.  Other oils do not compare.  The only negative point is the size of the bottles,  although a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Bottles were unsealed and in a used plastic bag.  We did not feel safe using them and threw them all away!</li>
    <li> Nice massage oils. Not sticky. smell only, dont actually taste like anything, which is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a gift and they said it was a great gift.</li>
    <li> I love these oils! Great taste and does not leave a greasy after effect. I will purchase this product again and again.</li>
    <li> Works great smells amazing but flavor is not the greatest. Kind of taste like ChapStick with a hint of fruity flavor but for what it is it was worth purchasing and I can see myself repurchasing.</li>
    <li> All of them are very nice. Except for the vanilla - it stinks.</li>
    <li> Just ok.  A little bit greasy but certainly is what it claimed to be.</li>
    <li> this product smells great and may be edible but it has no flavor at all. don&#x27;t buy if you want flavor this has none</li>
    <li> I already try the grapefruit one and the smell was delicious! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good, they came quickly, and they smell great. They don&#x27;t really taste that much like anything though.</li>
    <li> Bottles are really small.  I don&#x27;t think I would order again,</li>
    <li> Holy cow, a super pack!  These all smell pretty good.  There&#x27;s enough to keep you going for a while, you know, with massages or whatever.</li>
    <li> THERE IS NO TAST ONLY A SMELL</li>
    <li> These taste disgusting.</li>
    <li> Great texture, but not very tasty.  More scented than flavored, and the watermelon scent was almost overwhelmingly strong.  Although, I will say that the pictures on the bottles were amusing, but I didn&#x27;t buy these for the pictures...</li>
    <li> It smells good but taste like plastic, I thought it would taste like it smells. Nothing sexy about that.</li>
    <li> I loved the product, great flavors and great smells; I will definitely be a consistent user.Only issue is that it is hard to pour and spills very easily, but other than that it was great.</li>
    <li> Product is bland and tasteless</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice product to play before and during sex. Me and my girlfriend enjoyed it</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t taste as the fruit they have in the label, it&#x27;s pure oil taste</li>
    <li> No flavor whatsoever. Spills easily. Sorry I ordered.</li>
    <li> Excellent choice when you want to see how the other aroma&#x27;s work and how well you will like them before getting larger quanitites</li>
    <li> this was a bridal shower gift so i can&#x27;t say first hand how they worked, but the bride loved the gift - i use other earthly body products and I do love the brand</li>
    <li> Smell really good, but don&#x27;t taste like anything. Nice and silky though, perfect for a massage</li>
    <li> I used it on myself and my boyfriend kept telling me how sweet I tasted. You have to believe him.. he could not get enough. Very erotic. We both enjoyed the experience... now testing different flavors and playing:  \\&quot; Don&#x27;t show..  and tell\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Awesome for a good time or a gift! :) Flavors taste good and not too artificial!</li>
    <li> I just love the product!</li>
</ol>
