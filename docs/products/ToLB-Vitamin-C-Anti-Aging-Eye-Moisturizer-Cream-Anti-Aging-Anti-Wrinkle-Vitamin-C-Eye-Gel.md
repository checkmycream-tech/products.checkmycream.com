      <li>Must Say I Love This Serum.</li>
      <li>I use this eye gel with the Anti-aging mosturizer with Matrizyl and love the combination.  </li>
      <li>and it does not work any better.</li>

      <li>I did receive free samples from Tree of Life once they brought the original eye gel back.  </li>

      <li>The First Time I Received This Serum, It Came In Sample Size; When I Ordered The Retinol A Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>(my favorite facial product)?  </li>
      <li>I have used all the other products from Tree of Life at the same time and have been so happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I am figuring it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use it, but it certainly didn&#x27;t help.</li>
      <li>The cream itself works absolutely great on my skin, after numerous searches I finally can say I found my product - skin brightened up, toned and evened out, dark spots are vanishing and on latest pictures my face looks airbrushed which surprised me a lot.</li>
      <li>This gel--not heavy or greasy--goes on light and is absorbed quickly.  </li>
      <li>The eye gel smooths the appearance of any fine lines I have, softens my skin, and ultimately brightens my whole face.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and wakes me up instantly.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I am amazed that it really seems to work.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t  do much for my eyes.</li>
      <li>Some are hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;You need to try this product because you will be very pleased.</li>
      <li>I tend to get flakes in certain areas such as on my eyelids, and this moisturizes pretty much anywhere</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
      <li>My eyes looked more dried out in the morning than not using it.  </li>
      <li>I emailed Tree of Life  about my impressions of this new formula which we not favorable.  </li>
      <li>After ordering a new bottle of the Vitamin C Eye Gel on 12/13/15, I discovered when I received it that the formula  had changed.  </li>
      <li>Makeup goes over it very well and never balls up (provided you let it dry first).  </li>
      <li>I Have Sensitive Oily Skin; Almost Everything Causes Me To Breakout, THIS DOESN&#x27;T!</li>
      <li>It claims to be natural</li>
      <li>It is also considerably lightening my under eye area.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s never too early to start anti-aging products</li>
      <li>Love this product, you can see and feel the small lines tighten up right away and my dark circles have lighted up.</li>
      <li>When I heard back (right away) thus began a dialogue back and forth discussing this issue.    </li>
      <li>I had it with me on a month long trek out west on vacation, and towards the end of my trip I ran out much to my dismay as I was by then totally hooked.  </li>
      <li>The thing I have been so pleasantly surprised about is the quick results.&lt;br /&gt;The dark aging spots under my eyes and around my nose started getting lighter in a few days and are continuing lighten up.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not sure that it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell yet how product is working as it&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks.  The products glides on nicely and absorbs well.  One thing that needs improvement is the pump bottle.  I have to press hard for the gel to expel and when it does, one doesn&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s going to go.</li>
    <li> This company (Tree of Life Beauty) raises the bar on customer service and excellent products. I am in my 50&#x27;s, eat healthy and exercise regularly. I want to keep my skin as healthy as possible as I continue to age and Tree of Life Beauty is making that visibly possible. Every product feels great on my skin and I&#x27;m watching them perform wonders. Adding to the above review: I tried several other products because I received them as a gift to try out. NOTHING beats this eye moisturizer! Quite noticeably, a few days after using ToLB eye gel, I could see the difference. I stand by my first comments and realize that nothing else compares.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. YOU MUST TRY IT! I have used many different vitamin C products around my eyes and this is the best one I have ever found. It is not stiff or runny and I love the feel of the jell as opposed to a cream. It goes on smoothly and evenly and does not burn or hurt the sensitive skin around my eyes. The thing I have been so pleasantly surprised about is the quick results.&lt;br /&gt;The dark aging spots under my eyes and around my nose started getting lighter in a few days and are continuing lighten up. Some are hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;You need to try this product because you will be very pleased. Even the price is great for the quality and results you will get.</li>
    <li> loved the way this product went on so smooth.  I didn&#x27;t have any smear from my mascara and it immediately absorbed and there was no shine.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product, you can see and feel the small lines tighten up right away and my dark circles have lighted up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in just 5 days.  The wrinkles around my eyes are much less noticeable.  Very impressive.  Try this!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye gel for over a month now. I have not seen any visible changes or notice any improvement in this area. I would not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel!  I have tried so many eye gels and had bad reactions.  Not with this one!  I didn&#x27;t wake up with my eyes feeling sticky or glued shut.  I felt refreshed and looked more youthful.  The dark circles around my eyes were visibly lighter and I swear my wrinkles just disappeared!  The price is excellent for the quality. The results feel like when I would have facials at the spa. I have used all the other products from Tree of Life at the same time and have been so happy with the results. This seller was fantastic to deal with and quick to deliver. I would highly recommend the product and the seller. I will definitely be back.</li>
    <li> This is just as good as the anti-aging moisturizer. Very satisfied with the quick results this product delivers!</li>
    <li> I am an Aesthetician and spent over 4 years in the luxury skin care industry in NYC. I LOVE THIS! Lightweight and velvety. I have oily skin and often eye product cause my makeup to slide. This didn&#x27;t! Helped my circles and fine lines. It&#x27;s a must for any regimen at this price!</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  Didn&#x27;t work well on the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I use this eye gel with the Anti-aging mosturizer with Matrizyl and love the combination.  It&#x27;s never too early to start anti-aging products and I have been super happy with these!  They are also so much cheaper than the salon ones!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t  do much for my eyes.</li>
    <li> This product made no difference around my eyes.  My eyes looked more dried out in the morning than not using it.  I am figuring it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use it, but it certainly didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel!  I&#x27;ve purchased Pericone&#x27;s products at triple the price and it does not work any better. This has vitamin C which is proven to help with puffiness and it has anti-aging properties. It&#x27;s wholesome and it really helps! Love Love Love!!!</li>
    <li> This gel--not heavy or greasy--goes on light and is absorbed quickly.  I noticed a dewy, glow after just a few days of use.  I am amazed that it really seems to work.  The effect is that my skin is replenished and happy.  Some got in one eye by accident,  which is a big &amp;#34;no no&amp;#34; and any other product would have been painful but it was no big deal and washed out quickly with tears.  This is a great product.  Five stars all the way!!</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel.  The consistency is perfect under my eyes.  It is moisturizing and emollient, meaning that any fine lines I have fairly disappear.  It&#x27;s perfect under makeup too--no pilling and very smooth once dry.  I use it morning and night.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.  I originally got a free tiny bottle of it with my Tree of Life Retinol Moisturizer.  It was a great advertising move, as I fell in love with it.  I had it with me on a month long trek out west on vacation, and towards the end of my trip I ran out much to my dismay as I was by then totally hooked.  I ordered more when I got home and luckily it came quickly.  It&#x27;s a staple for me in my daily face care.  It is also considerably lightening my under eye area.  Update 4/4/16: After ordering a new bottle of the Vitamin C Eye Gel on 12/13/15, I discovered when I received it that the formula  had changed.  I emailed Tree of Life  about my impressions of this new formula which we not favorable.  When I heard back (right away) thus began a dialogue back and forth discussing this issue.    I had asked if the formula had changed and asked why change what I call a perfect product (my favorite facial product)?  Ultimately, a team of individuals working on products decided to rethink the change they had made.  In the end they decided, much to my sheer joy, to change back to their original formula.  The Vitamin C Eye Gel is once again on the market and is as perfect as it was in the beginning.  I use it twice a day under my eyes and often all over my face and neck (I do the latter about 4x/week).  The eye gel smooths the appearance of any fine lines I have, softens my skin, and ultimately brightens my whole face.  I tend to get flakes in certain areas such as on my eyelids, and this moisturizes pretty much anywhere I put it and prevents flakes too.  Makeup goes over it very well and never balls up (provided you let it dry first).  I for one hope this formula stays the same forever and if it does, I will buy it forever.  I did receive free samples from Tree of Life once they brought the original eye gel back.  Hope this helps someone else.</li>
    <li> The First Time I Received This Serum, It Came In Sample Size; When I Ordered The Retinol A Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Must Say I Love This Serum. I Have Sensitive Oily Skin; Almost Everything Causes Me To Breakout, THIS DOESN&#x27;T! I Use It On My Eye Area &amp; My Entire Face.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend! Happy with product!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect solution for tired eyes!  It goes on smoothly and wakes me up instantly.  Better than a cucumber mask!!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Great service, item arrived on time, clean and neatly packaged with 3 additional samples and explanatory brochure. The cream itself works absolutely great on my skin, after numerous searches I finally can say I found my product - skin brightened up, toned and evened out, dark spots are vanishing and on latest pictures my face looks airbrushed which surprised me a lot. I would recommend this and the other 3 I am using. I started with the Retinol with Hyaluronic acid cream and received 3 other samples. After using it for just a week I started to see visible difference in my skin appearance. Samples ran out so I purchased the other 3 products now in regular size, so altogether I am using 4 products (two at night and two in the morning) and I can&#x27;t be happier with the results. It claims to be natural (what I&#x27;ve been looking for) so I am hoping I will settle with this product and would not have to be on a lookout for another one for a while. The price is also better than good for the results I get so overall I had a very good experience with the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used eye serum before and was always bothered by two things: the burning sensation once they were applied and irritation to my eyes themselves.  With this product, I got neither. The darkened circles under my eyes disappeared and my eyes had a younger look as many of my friends and co-workers commented to that fact. My favorite product!</li>
    <li> After using this product my eyes felt to fresh and bright.  No more heavy lids or under eye circles.  very refreshing and cool.</li>
