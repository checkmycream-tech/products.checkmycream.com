      <li>Love the Nag...</li>
      <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
      <li>If you love the smell of the incense you will love this.  </li>
      <li>Striking close to the incense.  </li>
      <li>The delivery was great and far more prompt than was estimated by the computer.</li>
      <li>First time customer, and a VERY satisfied one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love sweet Patchouli from Sun&#x27;s Eye...which I will always buy.</li>
      <li>Pure Bliss!!!</li>
      <li>The product itself was great, to no surprise, since I have used this same oil before.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definetely a musk, but also smells a bit floral with a hint of light jasmine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Can mix into used wax on a warmer and enjoy the scent.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone looking for the true Nag Champa scent.</li>
      <li>the smell is so sweet and fills the room.  </li>
      <li>if you really love nag champa, this is the real thing.</li>
      <li>This oil has a true Nag Champa scent.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not a fan of sweet, or if you want a little variation depending on your mood, throw in a drop of a strong, citrusy oil like grapefruit (Aura Acacia&#x27;s is great).</li>
      <li>Nag Champa is one of my favorite scents and this stuff really smells like the real deal!</li>
      <li>Exactly what she wanted for Mothers Day!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s somewhat light, but very fragrant.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t smell right to me.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this very pure Nag Champa oil as well as the Uncrossing oil.</li>
      <li>A little sweeter, more floral than the incense, probably because it&#x27;s not a burned scent, but I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Pure undisputed!</li>
      <li>Pure!</li>
      <li>this is the real deal!</li>
      <li>Its long lasting and a beautiful light smell, only need a touch, definate recommend!</li>
      <li>Also, a little bit on old incense stick  to revitalize and a bit on a cotton puff in your cigarette holder in your car/truck is great.  </li>
      <li>It is 100% pure Nag Champa deliciousness.</li>
      <li>this is pure...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>thanks will order again</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to everyone that loves Nag Champ as much as I do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of incense because it irritates my throat, so it&#x27;s nice to have an alternative in oil form.</li>
      <li>We highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Price without Prime is a bit high.</li>
      <li>My mom asked me to put a few drops in an electric oil burner in the living room when she smelled my room. :-)</li>
      <li>Where I live you can&#x27;t burn candles.</li>
      <li>when you first put it on, its not apparent.</li>
      <li>I have a nebulizer diffuser, and 3 drops really make my whole room smell from the other side of the house.</li>
      <li>but give it a little time and its EXACTLY the same smell as satya/blue &amp; white box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks sun&#x27;s eye.</li>

<li> Lasts a long time if you use as a perfume - only need a little bit.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> It takes the sweetness a notch down, but it still smells like Nag Champa.&lt;br</li>
<li> After reading through a bunch of reviews on the Nag Champa oils offered on amazon, I stumbled across a review (for another supplier) that recommended the Nag Champa oil &amp;#34;with the black top&amp;#34;, instead of the oil</li>
<li> Just put a few drops of oil on the pad and turn it on.</li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but for this little bundle of amazingness I had to!!</li>
<li> Not the smell I remember from the late 70&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s.  </li>
<li> Smells like Secret for Women baby powder scented underarm deodorant.</li>
<li> Very weak for Champa.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
<li> Made me sick to my stomach...</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> I use this in my laundry especially on my sheets. Makes them welcoming after a long day. Also use it in my home in my Scentsy warmers....works great and makes my cabin smell so nice.</li>
    <li> These oils are amazing. They raise the vibration. I noticed a big shift in the mood of our home after using these. Even my animals started acting like puppies. My massage therapist who comes to my home noticed it before I even told her. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
    <li> All i can say is: I LOVE IT!!!  Its long lasting and a beautiful light smell, only need a touch, definate recommend!</li>
    <li> Nag Champa is one of my favorite scents and this stuff really smells like the real deal! I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Love the Nag... thanks will order again</li>
    <li> Very weak for Champa. Don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Not the smell I remember from the late 70&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s.  It just doesn&#x27;t smell right to me.  Can&#x27;t pinpoint the difference, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife discovered this in her yoga class. She loves it.</li>
    <li> This oil is magical!  Striking close to the incense.  If you&#x27;re a fan of nag champa incense and don&#x27;t mind a hint of vanilla undertone this is for you!!  Will not disappoint.  Whenever I burn the oil I get glowing approval and applause.  A must have</li>
    <li> Have bought 3!  love it</li>
    <li> Smells great! Soothing in my tence enviorment.&lt;br /&gt;Get a lot compliments.</li>
    <li> If you love the smell of the incense you will love this.  Lasts a long time if you use as a perfume - only need a little bit.

    <li> I had never heard of it. But smelled a candle with it and loved. Where I live you can&#x27;t burn candles. Bought a fan diffuser. Just put a few drops of oil on the pad and turn it on. Soon after my room smells great.</li>
    <li> This is great in my warmer. I just came in from mowing the lawn and my whole house smells great.</li>
    <li> Beautiful product. Would definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this oil.  Received quickly, fair price, would purchase again.  This oil has a true Nag Champa scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of Nag Champa and I was thrilled to find it in oil form. After reading through a bunch of reviews on the Nag Champa oils offered on amazon, I stumbled across a review (for another supplier) that recommended the Nag Champa oil &amp;#34;with the black top&amp;#34;, instead of the oil the review was under.  I rolled the dice and bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE it. It&#x27;s somewhat light, but very fragrant. It smells a lot like the Nag Champa, &amp;#34;Sunrise&amp;#34; incense. It&#x27;s definetely a musk, but also smells a bit floral with a hint of light jasmine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lifts my spirit and is very pleasant and tranquil. I will definitely buy this again!</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell. Made me sick to my stomach...I love sweet Patchouli from Sun&#x27;s Eye...which I will always buy. I would suggest going to a store that sells sun&#x27;s eye oil before you buy here!</li>
    <li> if you really love nag champa, this is the real thing. when you first put it on, its not apparent. but give it a little time and its EXACTLY the same smell as satya/blue &amp; white box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks sun&#x27;s eye.</li>

    <li> I love this oil every time I wear it I get compliments !! You&#x27;ll love it !! And it&#x27;s cheep !!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents.</li>
    <li> Total garbage. Smells like Secret for Women baby powder scented underarm deodorant. I&#x27;ve been using Nag Champa incense since i was a teenager, over 30 years, this smells nothing like it at all. Very disappointed. I will be attempting to get my money back.</li>
    <li> this is pure...the smell is so sweet and fills the room.  one of the best I&#x27;ve found in a while</li>
    <li> Awesome Nag-Champa scented oil!  Almost perfect.  Can mix into used wax on a warmer and enjoy the scent.  Also, a little bit on old incense stick  to revitalize and a bit on a cotton puff in your cigarette holder in your car/truck is great.  Price without Prime is a bit high.</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicer nags that I have found out there. Wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have tried other variations of Nag Champa, and the off brands smell totally different than Sun&#x27;s Eye.  Sun&#x27;s Eye is the best by far.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.  We highly recommend.</li>
