### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It gives the best lather you could ever want!</li>
      <li>It is so great for washing my kids</li>
      <li>This soap is a matter of shame for an otherwise great Kirkland brand.</li>
      <li>Lathers up great.</li>
      <li>It is a great value, but not my kind of soap.</li>
      <li>For me, this is a good thing, since I don&#x27;t like it anyway.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a good soap though</li>
      <li>and I love the way my skin feels!</li>
      <li>I really love it!</li>
      <li>Guests have stayed at my house and asked what kind of soap we have.</li>
      <li>But Kirkland&#x27;s is a good soap, and for less than a dollar a bar, I&#x27;m happy to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Kirkland for another good deal on a good product.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and it came with so many soap bars I thought I was getting a pretty good deal on this product.</li>
      <li>I have been using this soap for 20 years now and am more than satisfied with it.  </li>
      <li>I would not want more as I don&#x27;t want to get my perfume from my soap.  </li>
      <li>I love the way Dove smells and feels.  </li>
      <li>Love the soap.</li>
      <li>I have not used any more tube shaving lather since.</li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>It has a mild, pleasant clean scent.  </li>
      <li>It has a light scent which I don&#x27;t mind, even though I prefer unscented products.</li>
      <li>A rare clunker from an otherwise outstanding brand.</li>
      <li>Also, my skin didn&#x27;t have the smooth feeling that Dove gives me.</li>
      <li>Dove leaves my skin (and shower walls) clean and smooth feeling.</li>
      <li>Just bought a pack at Costco, new packaging looks very much like Dove multi-packs, very attractive compared to old drab packaging, claim on box that says that it is 1/4 oil/cream just like Dove.</li>
      <li>Big bars, you get to buy a lot at once, and it&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>It leaves your face smooth and soft and is much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Many generic versions of products are just fine, but once in a blue moon, brand loyalty is well deserved.  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be finishing the one bar I opened and certainly won&#x27;t use any of the rest.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this, it&#x27;s fresh with a little bit of citrus scent.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend trying this soap!</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t use it on my face as a rule, but as an all-around household/bath soap, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin didn&#x27;t have that smooth feeling after I showered like my former soap.</li>
      <li>After just one shower with the Kirkland soap I noticed a dull coating on my tub and shower walls, the familiar \\&quot;soap scum\\&quot; for which I buy special removers to get rid of!</li>
      <li>I was so displeased that I returned the remaining 14 bars for a full refund at my local Costco.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t write Amazon reviews, but seeing this soap I&#x27;ve bought for years so denigrated by reviewers here, I had to hop on and say</li>
      <li>I let my shower go for a few more weeks before cleaning it to see what would happen.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as moisturizing as dove brand, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad at drying out out skin as ivory.  </li>
      <li>It gets me clean, has a nice citrus-like smell, and doesn&#x27;t leave the heavy scum many people write about in other reviews.</li>
      <li>I purchased the kirkland 15 bar body soap because it stated it has 25% moisturizing cream and made with high quality natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I generally trust the Kirkland brand, not so much now though.</li>
      <li>Faint, pleasant citrus smell.</li>
      <li>however, don&#x27;t wash your young kids with this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It is not moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave a nice scent behind.</li>
      <li>It also stung my more sensitive areas, although only a little even a little is way too much.  </li>
      <li>Even with relatively hard water it lathers up quickly and leaves no residue after rinsing off.  </li>
      <li>Rinsed for 10 minutes, was still red and burning for 6 hours afterwards, to the point that I could barely keep it open.</li>
      <li>The bars are individually wrapped and the scent is pleasant, but my biggest complaint is the film left behind on my shower walls, tub and skin.</li>

<li> This Kirkland soap on the other hand?  </li>
<li> After only 2 uses my skin has never looked so incredibly dull.  </li>
<li> I see that people either love this soap or hate it.</li>
<li> I used half a bar and gave the rest away.</li>
<li> Tried this a few years ago, probably around 2k10 or 2k11, had to return it because it was burning my forehead and making me look a bit sun burnt.  </li>

<li> but this soap is not good.</li>

    <li> Lord. What is wrong with the people here who are fans of this soap?  Ran out of Dove, gave this a try since it sounded like the same thing.  Many generic versions of products are just fine, but once in a blue moon, brand loyalty is well deserved.  I love the way Dove smells and feels.  This Kirkland soap on the other hand?  Its like someone mixed a cheap disinfectant with the smell of a poorly staffed rest home.  Chrimany, I have like 14 bars of this nasty product left.  I don&#x27;t like to waste, but I might be making an exception!</li>
    <li> I have used this soap as a shaving lather for the last year. I have not used any more tube shaving lather since. I shave using a brush and blade. It leaves your face smooth and soft and is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Over all I like Kirkland products but this soap is not good. It smells nice and it came with so many soap bars I thought I was getting a pretty good deal on this product. After a few weeks I noticed how badly it coats my shower then I thought about what its doing to my body!  I let my shower go for a few more weeks before cleaning it to see what would happen. And it actually starts to coat everything in your shower the drain your shower accessories and other products everything looks white. I threw away my last bar.</li>
    <li> Just bought a pack at Costco, new packaging looks very much like Dove multi-packs, very attractive compared to old drab packaging, claim on box that says that it is 1/4 oil/cream just like Dove. The bars are individually wrapped and the scent is pleasant, but my biggest complaint is the film left behind on my shower walls, tub and skin. Dove leaves my skin (and shower walls) clean and smooth feeling. After just one shower with the Kirkland soap I noticed a dull coating on my tub and shower walls, the familiar \\&quot;soap scum\\&quot; for which I buy special removers to get rid of! Also, my skin didn&#x27;t have the smooth feeling that Dove gives me. I was so displeased that I returned the remaining 14 bars for a full refund at my local Costco.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this, it&#x27;s fresh with a little bit of citrus scent.  It&#x27;s not nearly as moisturizing as dove brand, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad at drying out out skin as ivory.  It&#x27;s around the range of Irish spring w/aloe.  Big bars, you get to buy a lot at once, and it&#x27;s good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A warning however, don&#x27;t wash your young kids with this stuff.  I got it in my eye once and it was the most painful thing I&#x27;ve ever felt in my life regarding getting things in eyes.  Rinsed for 10 minutes, was still red and burning for 6 hours afterwards, to the point that I could barely keep it open. It eventually went away overnight.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews stating the same through a google search, so be careful with this around eyes or with kids.  It&#x27;s still a good soap though and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I see that people either love this soap or hate it. I&#x27;m one of those that loves it since I don&#x27;t try to compare it to Dove, which I don&#x27;t like as a man&#x27;s soap anyway. It gets me clean, has a nice citrus-like smell, and doesn&#x27;t leave the heavy scum many people write about in other reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It gives the best lather you could ever want! Guests have stayed at my house and asked what kind of soap we have. I have not had any problems with film on my shower/bath walls or on my skin. It is so great for washing my kids b/c it suds up so well in the washcloth and makes bathtime easier!! It has a light scent which I don&#x27;t mind, even though I prefer unscented products. I really love it!</li>
    <li> This soap lathers well, however, it leaves awful soap scum on my body and shower walls. It is also not gentle on sensitive skin. It is a great value, but not my kind of soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it advertised 1/4 moisturizers, was packaged similar to, and displayed side by side with Dove; I thought it would be comparable to Dove.  It. Is. Not.  It left a residue on my skin and dried it out.  It also stung my more sensitive areas, although only a little even a little is way too much.  After only 2 uses my skin has never looked so incredibly dull.  I won&#x27;t be finishing the one bar I opened and certainly won&#x27;t use any of the rest.  I generally trust the Kirkland brand, not so much now though.</li>
    <li> I usually like Kirkland Signature products. However, this body soap did not meet my expectations; It left my skin very very dry. I returned this product and will continue to use Dove.</li>
    <li> This is an improvement over the last incarnation but still is not near equal to Dove.  We gave it a shot but will give the remaining package away.  It cuts the water but is harsh on facial skin.  I&#x27;m a man with rough skin and it burns my face.</li>
    <li> Love the soap. Used it at a cabin on vacation and the only place I could find it was amazon. Lathers up great.</li>
    <li> It is Horrible. It burns my private parts. I have never ever had that problem before with any other soap.</li>
    <li> I purchased the kirkland 15 bar body soap because it stated it has 25% moisturizing cream and made with high quality natural ingredients. That is an extreme exaggeration. It drys your skin terrible. My son was looking like I flour battered him.</li>
    <li> Tried this a few years ago, probably around 2k10 or 2k11, had to return it because it was burning my forehead and making me look a bit sun burnt.  Sounds like it hasn&#x27;t improved.</li>
    <li> Family likes this soap</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for 20 years now and am more than satisfied with it.  Even with relatively hard water it lathers up quickly and leaves no residue after rinsing off.  In short I like it!</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t work for me. I used half a bar and gave the rest away. It smelled like a combination of Dove and those discs one finds in the men&#x27;s room. My skin was dry after uses.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed - thought this would be similar to Dove, but the soap is very harsh on certain areas.  Now I have a bulk of soap that I will never use again!</li>
    <li> This soap is a matter of shame for an otherwise great Kirkland brand. If you are reading the customer reviews and have the power to do so, please take it off the market.&lt;br /&gt;Beware - This is nowhere close to a dove</li>
    <li> I bought this soap at Costco... now I don&#x27;t know what to do with the remaining 14 bars. I hate everything about this soap. It is not moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave a nice scent behind.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend trying this soap! My dermatologist recommended it and I love the way my skin feels!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write Amazon reviews, but seeing this soap I&#x27;ve bought for years so denigrated by reviewers here, I had to hop on and say a few words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, no, it&#x27;s not like Dove.  For me, this is a good thing, since I don&#x27;t like it anyway.  It has a mild, pleasant clean scent.  I would not want more as I don&#x27;t want to get my perfume from my soap.  It&#x27;s a bit drying so I don&#x27;t use it on my face as a rule, but as an all-around household/bath soap, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, if I had the money, I&#x27;d always stock Caswell-Massey, as their soaps are heavenly.  But Kirkland&#x27;s is a good soap, and for less than a dollar a bar, I&#x27;m happy to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Kirkland for another good deal on a good product.</li>
    <li> If you buy this soap for its moisturizing ability you might be disappointed. It sudses well, but the lather is stiff and dry, not creamy and lush like Dove and Olay. Left my skin clean but with a lingering unnatural, slightly caustic feeling that made me itch. Faint, pleasant citrus smell. A rare clunker from an otherwise outstanding brand. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to save money. Big mistake. It left my skin dry and irritated. My skin didn&#x27;t have that smooth feeling after I showered like my former soap. Don&#x27;t buy this product. It&#x27;s horrible.</li>
