      <li>Pump was great for the first 16 oz jar of Cerave we used it with.</li>
      <li>I was so happy with this for the first couple of months, but now I&#x27;m finding that it gets clogged after continuous use.  </li>

      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>I used this to put on the top of my</li>
      <li>If you love the moisture lotion in a jar, you&#x27;ll really love being able to pump it out rather than dig it out.</li>
      <li>then you will love this.</li>

      <li>Having the pump makes it sooo easy that I always put some on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fits nicely on my CeraVe moisturizer tub. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Worked Perfectly out of the box. Helpful for my big Cerave cream.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to go along with the large jar of CeraVe body cream, and it works fantastic!  I was afraid the cream would be too thick for the pump, but I was wrong.  Makes it so much easier to get the lotion out without having to deal with the lid each time.  Would definitely recommend - and I have.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with Cerave in the tub and it works wonderfully to keep my dirty fingers out of my lotion. I had to trim the straw-part quite a bit to get it to fit snugly, but it works just fine!</li>
    <li> do not purchase this.  purchased it to pump lotion.  does not pump/dispense any lotion at all.  very disappointed - waste of money.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job! Great with the Cerave lotion in the tub.</li>
    <li> It worked great.... until it didn&#x27;t.  I just put this on a new tub of Cerave cream and after pumping a gazillion times, I gave up as nothing came out.  But of course I already threw the Cerave cover away, so now I have to continue leaving this pump on the container as a cover.  Super inconvenient.  Not sure what happened, and maybe I got a faulty one, but it only worked for one tub.  I did push the dispenser down and turn it to keep it locked while I was transporting it so it wouldn&#x27;t leak, so maybe that did it.  But even if so.... doing that should damage the pump!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work..returned</li>
    <li> Pump fit the cerave tub well.  It stopped working before I could finish my second tub.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing. Fits my Cerave tub perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically for the aforementioned moisturizer, and it performs the intended function well. No issues so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit (after a few months): my jug of CeraVe is about 15% full, which seems to be too thin a layer for the pump to function properly.</li>
    <li> Fits jar well. However is very hard to release pump:-(</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and use lotion constantly - this pump allows me to use Cerave in the tub more easily, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting bacteria into the tub from my fingers. Perfect fit, works extremely well even with the thick lotion.</li>
    <li> This does not fit in the CereVe tub. The tube is too long. Very disappointed since it states that it does.</li>
    <li> I have a conditioner that comes in a jar that I love. I was putting it in a bottle but now I can pop this pump on for convenience. It works well, and I appreciate that because I have some products with pumps that do not work. Definitely purchase this if you have a favorite product in a jar.</li>
    <li> Product did not work at all. Did not pump out the cream not even once.</li>
    <li> This fits my tub of CeraVe cream perfectly.  Much more hygienic than dipping my fingers in everyday!</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly on CeraVe tubs.</li>
    <li> Fits the CeraVe tub. Doesn&#x27;t do anything funny like, shoot lotion, get stuck or ooze out.</li>
    <li> Fit the jar perfectly.</li>
    <li> This jar fits perfectly on the Cerave in the Tub product which is what I purchased it from. It&#x27;s able to pump the thick lotion out no problem. I like using the pump because I don&#x27;t have to worry about germs getting in the tub from my fingers.</li>
    <li> Bought it for Cerave in the tub and it fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works well with the CeraVe Moisturizing Cream 16 oz tub. It fits the new CeraVe tubs as well. Once I got to near the bottom of the tub, the pump stopped working and I had to unscrew the lid to finish the rest of the product. That&#x27;s understandable because it&#x27;s not possible to pump out the very bottom. If you buy the CeraVe tub, keep the regular lid for travel/backup.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but too tall for the smaller cerave tubs,you have to get the bigger ones.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my CeraVe moisturizer and it fits perfectly. The plastic is nice and thick.</li>
    <li> Works well so far, fits the oversized 19oz CeraVe tub sold at Costco. Given the price, one hopes it will hold up to normal use for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used CeraVe for a couple of years. Before I discovered this pump, I opened the jar, applied CeraVe, and then had trouble tightening the lid when my CeraVe-covered fingers slipped on its smooth plastic. The drawer of my bedside table was tall enough for the jar and lid but not for the jar with the pump on it, so I had to move the combination on top. It adds a little to the clutter, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Worked for about the first month and then all it did was pump air. Would not purchase again!</li>
    <li> Pump did not fit standard 16 oz jar and was very flimsy.  Hard to imagine this pump successfully dispensing anything thick or lasting very long.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my 16oz jar</li>
    <li> This works great.  I purchased it for the big tub of cerave cream which I had added essential oils to.  Makes it easy to get what amount you want without opening the jar and jeopardizing the ingredients with air and bacteria</li>
    <li> This pump works really well with the Cerave 16oz Moisturizing cream jar. I didn&#x27;t like that they charged so much for it, but since it helps keep the cream clean from bateria and from my husband using his fingers in the jar it&#x27;s a plus. I just think the price is a bit to high since you can get the cream for $15.00 a jar when you buy 2. Paying more than half of the price of the pump is just a bit high in my eyes.</li>
    <li> Beware. Does not fit SA renewing cream 12oz jars.</li>
    <li> I just put this pump on my jar of Cerave cream and it works great! Initially when I put it on the jar I thought it was broken because nothing was coming out. It took make 20-30 pumps before anything would come out (probably because the cream is pretty thick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t have to be super careful about how clean my hands are before using my Cerave.</li>
    <li> Fits &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;  Matrix conditioning jar and Cerave cream jar even though are  different shapes. Makes dispensing these products much easier and less wasteful. Pump is off to one side of the lid, which isn&#x27;t obvious from the photo. I will order more.</li>
    <li> I just received this pump and I already love it!  I love CeraVe cream and I&#x27;m so excited to be able to use it more because I don&#x27;t have to unscrew the lid.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and fit perfectly on my cerave cream jar.</li>
    <li> Works great on the CeraVe 16oz jar.</li>
    <li> Keeps my cerave clean!</li>
    <li> The pump that I received is defective. It won&#x27;t even pump water, it does not work at all. I definitely regret buying this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a 16.9 oz Matrix tub. It now fits perfectly and I&#x27;m quite satisfied, but I first had to clip off ~1/3&amp;#34; to get it to fit inside my particular bottle. Since the description implies it is more of a universal pump, I thought I&#x27;d mention this for anyone curious about how it fits different brands. Definitely a great buy, though!</li>
    <li> I bought this pump to put on my CeraVe moisturizing cream in the tub so I could keep it sanitary and use it without sticking my fingers into the product and it works perfectly!</li>
    <li> The pump I received does not work. The pumping mechanism is broken, and nothing happens when you push it... No suction is created, and nothing comes out.</li>
    <li> Works great for the Cerave in the tub!</li>
    <li> This pump works only partially.  it does not allow for all the cream to be pumped out of the jar.  This is disappointing.</li>
    <li> Not happy about this product. I purchased it last week and I was happy to receive it sooner than expected. The top does not look the same as the picture. It is also way too long to fit in the CeraVe 16oz tub of moisturizing cream. I had to cut it several times to make it fit. Please update your advertised picture and let it be know that you have to cut it to make it fit.</li>
    <li> This pump is very handy for my tub of lotion but it doesn&#x27;t get all the way to the bottom so towards the end, I still have to dig in there with my fingers.  For use of the first 85% of my lotion tub, it is great.</li>
    <li> Bought this solely to use on my Cerave cream tubs, as it&#x27;s much more sanitary to use a pump instead of dipping product out with my fingers. the pump fit perfectly and is very well made - no cheap, flimsy parts here!</li>
    <li> I use this with my CeraVe 16-oz cream; however, my pump suddenly stopped working for no reason.  Since I had two spares on hand, I wasn&#x27;t worried, but then neither of the other two worked either !!  So BEWARE, look for another brand if you can because these are clearly not reliable and do not function well.  Will Amazon refund my money?  Probably not because I purchased them a while ago to use for spares.  Such a waste of money, darn.....</li>
    <li> Cerave is the only thing that makes my eczema on my hands bearable. I love it and recommend it to everyone. Only complaint about it was opening it and sticking my not always sparkling clean fingers inside the tub to get my lotion. Also, having to stop and open it up, scoop some out, apply on hands, and close with lotiony moist hands isn&#x27;t hard at all but it is enough of a nuisance to me that I sometimes won&#x27;t moisturize when I should. Having the pump makes it sooo easy that I always put some on. Pump works perfect.  It was thrown around in my overnight bag also and did not break or malfunction or accidentally squirt anywhere.</li>
    <li> It took a lot of pumping before the lotion (CeraVe) dispenced. I guess it&#x27;s like sucking a thick milkshake through a straw.  The pump has worked fine since.</li>
    <li> Fits top of jar, great to pump it out instead of sticking you finger in it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect for Cerave in the tub.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for some CeraVe cream that I purchased at Costco. It fits perfectly!  I was very happy, because I don&#x27;t like dipping my fingers into creams.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and was not disappointed.  It works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> If you love the moisture lotion in a jar, you&#x27;ll really love being able to pump it out rather than dig it out. Well worth the money, and I expect it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Pump was great for the first 16 oz jar of Cerave we used it with. However, the pump broke before we could get it on the 2nd jar. The pump no longer suctions the lotion through. We used it moderately, no more than 1-2 times daily. For the price, I had hoped for much better quality.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work with the jar of CeraVe lotion.</li>
    <li> This pump is awesome!  The only thing I hated about my CeraVe lotion was the fact I had to dip my hand into the jar every time.  Now, its not an issue at all!  One of the other reviews said that the pump felt flimsy, but I don&#x27;t think it is at all.  The ONLY drawback is if you do a full pump, you get a little too much lotion for your face. A half a pump is about all you need. :)</li>
    <li> I use it with my big jar of cerave. Perfect for keeping bacteria out of my moisturizer and off of my face.</li>
    <li> Pump would not work--even tried it in water--no suction.  It would appear from reading comments from others that  orders for this item that were sent out during the months of April to June, 2014, contained defective pumps.  Not worth the hassle of trying again.</li>
    <li> This device worked through one jar of the Cerave cream and then completely stopped working. Wish I knew how to get a refund.</li>
    <li> Does NOT fit the Cerave Moisturizing tub.  Perhaps it fit an older version but the recent tub I bought did fit with this pump. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Fits Cerave 19 oz perfectly.</li>
    <li> great response time on delivery. hope the pump lasts awhile.</li>
    <li> Works well as a pump.  It fits on the old Cerave jars well; I&#x27;m not sure if it would fit on their new jar design.  It isn&#x27;t super sturdy, but it does its job well.</li>
    <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t have any suction. It doesn&#x27;t dispense my moisturizer properly and it also fell apart. This is incredibly unfortunate for the price and I don&#x27;t even see the point in trying to send it back because it&#x27;s not like it can be repackaged and sold again. This was a waste of $9 for me. It looks like others have posted that they have also had similar issues with a batch of defective pumps. I hope something is done about this.</li>
    <li> This pump top works very well screwed on to the top of a tub of [[ASIN:B000Q2RP7I CeraVe Moisturizing Cream, 16 oz ]]. That is until one gets to the bottom 1/4\\&quot; of product....then it stops working because the stem of the pump is just a wee bit too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I resisted the purchase because of the cost, but for the most part, the pump works extremely well, even with a product as thick as this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one or two pumps are enough to dispense a perfect amount of moisturizer and until I get to the bottom, I don&#x27;t have to dip my fingers into the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell how durable this pump top is. Plus, I have to remember not to discard it along with the tub when the product is depleted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have awarded this 4 stars if the stem had been longer.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time, but clearly had some kind of previous use as the spigot had gunk inside of it, which I find to be disgusting. After cleaning it out in warm water, it failed to pump even water. I purchased this from Jamark Laboratories, Inc, and will be leaving a similar seller review.</li>
    <li> Excellent, clean way to use cream!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my Cerave tub moisturizer and woks like a charm</li>
    <li> I bought this pump for the As I Am CoWash 16oz.&lt;br /&gt;It fits and it prevents my 11 year old from wasting product.</li>
    <li> Lotion is too thick to flow properly so it does not keep a continuous flow of lotion you tend to have to pound the can to get it to work.</li>
    <li> Like many others, mine was DOA.</li>
    <li> tip: when you receive it, you have to keep spinning the dispensing head until it pops out. it takes SEVERAL revolutions and i was super confused at first. but it works. does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Cheap piece of junk. Arrived with something inside the pump rattling. No suction at all.</li>
    <li> Makes a perfect lid for 16 oz tubs of CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. It&#x27;s super sturdy and keeps the cream from being contaminated by one&#x27;s fingers. Shoutout to the folks at Reddit&#x27;s skincare group! They made this recommendation and I&#x27;m grateful, as this was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Created a nice stream of lotion, not too much or too little</li>
    <li> It takes several pumps to get it going, but it works great.</li>
    <li> This pump makes it so much easier to get the right amount of lotion from the Surgeons Skin Secret Lotion bottle.</li>
    <li> I got this for the jar of my surgeons skin secret aloe moisturizing lotion.  perfect fit and pump works well.  doesn&#x27;t clog.  makes using the lotion easy and is also more sanitary than dipping one&#x27;s hand in the lotion.</li>
    <li> Looks like it would be handy on the tub of cream but with slippery hands it did not work out that way.  If you are using the cream a lot at one time it is tough like I am it is tough.</li>
    <li> I love this pump!  The moisturizer I use tends to dry out if I forget to put the lid back on it.  Also very convenient, and makes using my moisturizer much easier!</li>
    <li> Works well when the container is full to medium-full.  But then after that it&#x27;s a hassle.  I still like it but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I had read this would fit my CeraVe tub and was excited at the concept of not dipping into the jar with my hands. It just seemed unhygienic to me. I ordered this and it does just what I needed it to do. It&#x27;s a good quality pump, not cheaply made or flimsy in any way. It works great, is easy to pump, and pumps out a good amount of product. You can also control the release of the product by just pushing a little to get the exact amount you need. Great purchase for me.</li>
    <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work, try this first: dip the stem in a cup of water and pump a few times - this will get water inside the mechanism and &#x27;loosen&#x27; the bits of moisturizer stuck in it. When the pump begins spewing water, then you can transfer back to CeraVe and it will work better.</li>
    <li> Broken right out of the package</li>
    <li> fits perfectly on my cerave cream tub.. nice to not have to stick my finger in the entire container.</li>
    <li> does not fit cerave cream jar.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t match the photo and doesn&#x27;t fit the jar.  The stem is way too long.</li>
    <li> Had to take it apart to get it to work. After running water through it and messing with it for a half hour finally got it to work with my thick Cerave cream.</li>
    <li> this works so well  on my Cerave&amp;#34; cream. Makes using it so much easier.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use with my Cetaphil in the tub and it wouldn&#x27;t actually pump anything out but didn&#x27;t give an option to return.</li>
    <li> It works &amp; fits the jar of lotion that I attached it to.</li>
    <li> Bought this pump for Cerave lotion tub. Primed it about 20 times and it works great!</li>
    <li> Fits the Cera Ve Cream 16 Oz perfectly. So glad I bought this, so convenient to use. Would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Ordered from &amp;#34;smartsave&amp;#34; -- free expedited shipping was great, and they&#x27;ll ship it as a standalone. However the stem was significantly longer than pictured. I purchased this to use with cerave cream, and had to trim the stem by about 5-6&amp;#34; to fit in the bottle. the pump does not work very well. It takes many pumps to get any lotion, and you have to put your hand right by the pump  because otherwise it will go flying out and get on your clothing or whatever. I don&#x27;t like sticking my hand in the tub and this kind of works, so I guess I&#x27;ll keep it?</li>
    <li> Perfect for Cerave Cream.  I&#x27;ve used it on multiple jars.  Feels substantial.  Does seem overpriced but since I use it over and over...</li>
    <li> This lid fits the Cerave tub perfectly. Works well, and keeps your fingers out of the tub!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my CeraVe cream in the tub. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I received this today and so far it works great! It fits perfectly on my 16 oz CeraVe, and pumps very smoothly. I don&#x27;t know why other people are saying it&#x27;s too long, unless their jar is less than 16oz, because mine fit right out of the box. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> If you are a skincare fanatic and addicted to Cerave moisturizing cream (in the tub) then you will love this. You can screw it down to travel with it. I love it, and it keeps my bf&#x27;s grubby hands out of the jar!</li>
    <li> This gadget really works.</li>
    <li> I was so happy with this for the first couple of months, but now I&#x27;m finding that it gets clogged after continuous use.  Granted, I was using it with a pretty thick, cream product so maybe it&#x27;s not designed for that, but there is also no way to clear it out which is what let me down.  Soaking it with dishwashing liquid in hot water, trying to use q-tips to clean the inside, etc.  I did everything I could think of to try to clear the issue, but alas I ended up having to toss it away after less than a year of use.  Shipping and customer service, however, were phenomenal.  I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better shopping experience than I had with this user.  Just wish the product lasted longer than it did.  Live and learn!</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I&#x27;ve found it fits wonderfully on my CeraVe jar for hygienic moisturizing! I&#x27;m buying another because I think it will fit on my Albolene jar, too. I&#x27;ll update this review to let you know! (And skincare companies, if you&#x27;re reading this, you should create more hygienic products!)</li>
    <li> Fits CeraVe in the tub - exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Beats the s*** out of scooping it out and then trying to get the lid back on with slippery wonderfully lotion covered hands.</li>
    <li> This pump is a must for quickly applying heavy creams.  I was concerned that the heavy, thick cream that I use might be too much for the pump; however, to my delight, I can quickly apply with a simple push of the top.  Money well spent.</li>
    <li> I really dislike tubs/jars of health and beauty stuff that you have to scoop out in order to use because every time you put your hands in the stuff you are increasing the chances of adding bacteria or other gross things, even if you wash your hands first.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a tub of a certain sensitive skin moisturizing cream and this pump top fits perfectly on the 16 oz tub/jar and now I use my moisturizing cream more regularly since I don&#x27;t have to scoop it out of the jar.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with the Cerave Cream that comes in a big tub and it works perfectly. It has no problem pumping out the thicker Cerave cream.</li>
    <li> Fits my CeraVe Moisturizing Cream tub perfectly! Takes a while to get the cream started in the pump, but that&#x27;s because the cream is thick. Great way to keep the cream uncontaminated by dirty fingers.</li>
    <li> Great way to keep your lotion from getting dirty fingers in it.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it not working as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! I was beginning to despair when the first 20 - 30 pumps didn&#x27;t eject any lotion from the nozzle (I&#x27;m using the 16 oz CeraVe tub) but after the 30th try or so, it started to work to my surprise. Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my Cerave Moisturizer tub. It came broken. The pump did not pump the cream at all, let alone water. I was so disappointed, really wanted to use this, too.</li>
    <li> Its effective and works well. Made In America doesn&#x27;t come cheap, but it does what it claims.  It&#x27;s well made and makes the daily use of an awkward size bottle a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly on 16 ounce CeraVe moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ignore the one star ratings that say the pump has no suction, plus you can&#x27;t do the standard Amazon online return which makes returning it a pain in the butt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Just wanted to include that I was trying to use it with CeraVe lotion</li>
    <li> Use it for CereVe.  Essential!</li>
    <li> Really helped conserve on my conditioner. Wish I bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> Pump does not work--no suction at all.  Won&#x27;t even pump water or thinner (pump) lotions.  The pump fits onto a 16oz jar of CeraVe but nothing comes out no matter how many ways I try to make it work.  The cost of return is not worth it.  Some people have had luck with their pumps but for me it was a very pricey gamble that I lost.  I purchased mine early Feb 2015.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to use with my argan oil hair mask.  I like the pump.</li>
    <li> Fits my CeraVe Moisturizing Cream container perfectly and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I used this to replace the lid for my tub of Cerave cream. It works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my cerave moisturizer in the tub.  It fits perfectly and the pump moves to &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; the pump.  love it.</li>
    <li> It is perfectly fitted in 16 ounce jar.&lt;br /&gt;But it cannot pump out the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;This pump is not enoughly strong to pump out such a sticky lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is cheap enough to challenge whether it is worth to use if for me or not.</li>
    <li> Useful device for the product... Keeping it sanitary. A must have.</li>
    <li> It works great and looks exactly like the one in the picture. I use it for my CeraVe lotion and it is a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> Fits my Aquage conditioner jar perfectly.</li>
    <li> I used this to put on the top of my As I Am Coconut Co wash jar, because it was very difficult to take it in the shower and wash my hair without some kind of top or pump on it. This screws right on the top and I have no more difficulty in the shower.</li>
    <li> Pump stopped working within 2 weeks. I thought there was a problem because the container was only half full. Not so, put it on a new container, and it just doesn&#x27;t work any more.  Too late to get a replacement. Fingers in the jar works first time, every time !</li>
