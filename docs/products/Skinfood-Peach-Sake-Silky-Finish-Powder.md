      <li>I am new to this product, but I am loving it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(which is why I bought a compact for loose powder to use with it---though I think an old school powder case and puff--not for travel--would be the best option)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve</li>
      <li>Quickly</li>
      <li>I was really happy because my order came earlier then expected which was nice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a Korean brand, obviously geared towards very fair skinned Asian women or girls who come close to that skin tone.</li>

      <li>Thank you so much!</li>

      <li>This really helped me with my oily face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was smaller than I thought it would be, smaller around than my palm, but upon opening, I knew why.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is super fine</li>
      <li>Your skin will feel so soft, and it looks super natural.</li>
      <li>Initially my skin was matte, but like most products two hours later my skin is oily.</li>

      <li>EASY TO SPILL AND MAKE A MESS.</li>
      <li>eh, it does make my face really soft, butttttttttt</li>
      <li>SOFT COVERAGE AFTER MOISTURIZER.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cover up your skin with color, but make it look health and really soft when you touch</li>
      <li>I only use the high end face and powder products out there, and I have used them all!</li>
      <li>WOW</li>
      <li>I use it to set my makeup and it lasts for a pretty long time.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel really soft, and silky.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Long delivery. Not a lot of powder and not much different from any other finishing powder I have used in the past.  Smells nice but not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells lovely, my skin is silky and smooth, and I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m going for that &amp;#34;powdered mall goth&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My miniscule gripes/potential issues with this product would be:&lt;br /&gt;-the container can be pretty messy. (which is why I bought a compact for loose powder to use with it---though I think an old school powder case and puff--not for travel--would be the best option)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve pretty much got the palor of the undead; ergo this powder does not really stand out against my skin and make me look like a ghost...if you&#x27;re a WOC, or even just a white girl with a darker complexion than this pasty gal--you might not be so lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller also sent a sample face mask and pouch of moisturizer!!! All in all--I&#x27;m quite pleased and impressed.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells so good.</li>
    <li> I love love love loveeeee this powder. I use it over bb cream. It helps control oil (8/10) and give more flawless &amp; soft brighter look. It doesn&#x27;t  break me out either.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have seen a difference in my skin since using the Skinfood products. This is a little light for me and Ihave very pale Irish skin but I mix in a little bronzer and it is the perfect color.</li>
    <li> Makes me make up flawless</li>
    <li> I really love this product! It makes my skin super soft and not shiny. I was really happy because my order came earlier then expected which was nice :) I will for sure re purchase this item!</li>
    <li> Super fine smooth powder.  Sets your makeup beautifully and the smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> Great product... One of the best setting powders i have used.... Will order more... Shipping took awhile but it&#x27;s worth the wait... It was well packaged too... I like it alot</li>
    <li> Cakes on like baby powder</li>
    <li> My finish powder arrived in the mail yesterday and there was already a little powder loose BUT i&#x27;m not even upset over it because this stuff is great. IT SMELLS SO GOOD. I have combination skin. Other powders make me feel cakey, but this feels sooo nice. Your skin will feel so soft, and it looks super natural. I had so many people tell me they didn&#x27;t even know I was wearing makeup and compliment me on my skin. It is definitely worth buying and you only need the TINIEST amount of powder. The little puff in there is super cute and useful.</li>
    <li> This powder is amazing! It smells really good! I use it to set my makeup and it lasts for a pretty long time. If I&#x27;m not wearing makeup, I will put it on my face after my skincare routine to keep oil at bay. It works great and makes your skin really soft! I love it!</li>
    <li> All the females in our family use this powder. It last forever and leaves a very smooth and soft glow.</li>
    <li> The powder color is white as baby powder.  It makes me look like a ghost.  I can&#x27;t see anyone&#x27;s skin color can be this white.  i don&#x27;t see the point of this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I am new to this product, but I am loving it.&lt;br /&gt;It is sheer and would work for any complextion.</li>
    <li> I love this finishing powder. I have very oily skin and it keeps me matte for hours. Smells so fresh. My skin is very silky soft. Never cakes! I plan on using it forever!! Seller is excellent.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! It makes my skin feel really soft, and silky. I do like it as a finishing/setting powder. I gave this a four because it didn&#x27;t control my extremely oily skin. Initially my skin was matte, but like most products two hours later my skin is oily. It didn&#x27;t break me out! And my oiliness wasn&#x27;t as bad as it can be if I didn&#x27;t wear this.</li>
    <li> works great!! leaves a nice matte finish and is very sheer and silky. also smells nice too!!n</li>
    <li> I USE THIS POWDER WHEN IM NOT USING FOUNDATION... SOFT COVERAGE AFTER MOISTURIZER. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> So silky and smooth love the packagiing and the poof.</li>
    <li> Smells good but leaves me cakey</li>
    <li> Smell? WOW&lt;br /&gt;Package? Aww ♡&lt;br /&gt;Consistence and effect on skin? I love it ♡♡♡&lt;br /&gt;Spedition? Quickly</li>
    <li> The seller package_go_fast is awesome, I never expected it to arrive as well, quickly, as it did, and the product arrived pristine. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, oh...my...god. I absolutely love this scent, and it makes my skin look and feel so silky!&lt;br /&gt;It was smaller than I thought it would be, smaller around than my palm, but upon opening, I knew why.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is super fine, I know for certain it&#x27;ll last me forever if I keep it safe from a stiff breeze.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a cute puff that it comes with too.</li>
    <li> To those complaining about parabens: Shut the hell up and get out of here with that crap. Paraben research is still being conducted and nothing is solid fact as of yet. Parabens also only have an effect on you if there is a history of cancer in your family and even THAT information is STILL being studied before being rendered as fact. Take your wannabe hippie crap to your nearest Trader Joe&#x27;s, because nobody here cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my review of this product; It&#x27;s lovely. Some people complain that it&#x27;s too pale, but they could have looked up other swatches on Google for it. It&#x27;s a Korean brand, obviously geared towards very fair skinned Asian women or girls who come close to that skin tone. If you don&#x27;t fit it, don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder has been great for controlling shine on my nose and cheeks. It has not caused a breakout and it smells lovely. I use a brush instead of the puff to apply it due to preference; Puffs smush makeup onto my face and they don&#x27;t really blend it. This powder can be used to set your makeup or alone.</li>
    <li> For me this is better than Ben nye translucent loose powder. The smell is not over powering. I will buy this again</li>
    <li> Blends with my skin perfectly. Keeps the oil away all day! Smells nice.</li>
    <li> NICE SOFT PEACH SMELL.&lt;br /&gt;VERY FINE AND LIGHT TEXTURE. GOOD AS A LAST STEP IN MAKE-UP ROUTINE.&lt;br /&gt;MATTE FINISH TO SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;ONLY  NEGATIVE IS THAT THE PACKAGING. EASY TO SPILL AND MAKE A MESS.</li>
    <li> Absolute oil control &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cover up your skin with color, but make it look health and really soft when you touch</li>
    <li> This powder is very fine and makes my skin feel so silky and smooth! It is a white powder but when you dust it on the whiteness goes away and you get a nice amount of shine control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is really cute but can get annoying at times. The outside seen in the photos is the lid, and when you pull it out there is a puff that covers the holes that the powder comes out of. I find shaking the powder in order to get some a bit annoying, especially when I only need a bit of powder and get a lot instead. Other than that I really like the powder! It actually smells a lot like the Skinfood Peach Sake BB cream and makes my oily T-zone look matte and even.</li>
    <li> I love this peach powder it feels so smooth on my face,smells good and looks so nice on plus I got free samples which I loved all of them!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love Love this product! Face feels silky smooth and my makeup stays in place all day. I never have to re - powder my face. I only use the high end face and powder products out there, and I have used them all! This $9.00 product beats them all!! Bought it on a whim, so glad I did.</li>
    <li> Love IT !! Just Got It Didnt Have Tracking But Its Super Amazing I Got It Today &amp; Its Big ! I Though Id Be Smaller But Its Not So Happy With My Skin Food Can&#x27;t Wait To Try It! :)</li>
    <li> Just average, sadly makes my Bb cream clump roll off my face,good if used alone! Over priced average powder</li>
    <li> eh, it does make my face really soft, butttttttttt, I don&#x27;t like how dry it feels at the same time.</li>
    <li> Powder is light-weight and works just as I had hoped when combined with my usual face powder. The powder arrived earlier than expected and in perfect shape, well packed. Would definitely purchase again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so fine it doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;m wearing powder. It smells lovely as well. The downside, it gets everywhere no matter how hard you try and contain it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was an error, but when I received this product there was a small hole on the top of the packaging, which allowed a lot of powder to escape and was messy. But, My favorite thing about the powder was the smell- it smells delicious, like peach yogurt. The actual appearance of the makeup reminded me of ELF HD powder, as a small amount helps control shine but it doesn&#x27;t have great staying powder and if you accidentally use too much you will end up looking like a ghost- same goes for using this over dry skin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look cakey at all. So smooth and glowing. It is really white though, so I&#x27;m not sure how darker skin can use this.</li>
    <li> This powder is really good for oily skin.  I only have to apply once in the morning right after I apply BB Cream for setting my makeup, and then once again around midday.  It is a white powder, but blends well with my skin and doesn&#x27;t change my skin color to a pasty white like I have seen some reviews claim (I am a light to natural beige in MISSHA bb cream).</li>
    <li> Thank you so much! This really helped me with my oily face. I was looking and using so many products that failed to meet up to my needs. I will definitely be buying this product again and referring it to my friends. Plus thanks to CutiePieMarzia from Youtube who suggested this miracle worker!</li>
