      <li>Really good buy!</li>
      <li>All in all, this is a great kit</li>
      <li>It turned out great anyway, because the 16 gauge made it easier to get the 18 gauge nostril screw in my nose.</li>
      <li>i was so happy i got the kit</li>
      <li>it was a great buy and a bargain too👌</li>
      <li>This kit was great.</li>
      <li>and it looks great and isn&#x27;t infected</li>
      <li>Everything I specifically asked for was sent to me ,customer service was great</li>
      <li>very happy with my order:)</li>
      <li>Was a good kit.</li>
      <li>I LOVED THE STARTER SET THING</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with this item.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>but all in all I love my piercing!</li>
      <li>It was great, didn&#x27;t get infected, and months later, is perfect.</li>
      <li>but I do have my own.</li>
      <li>It was nice</li>
      <li>Everything is very great quality and very sterile.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and the needles are in excellent condition, except the jewellery is of very cheap cuality/material.</li>
      <li>Had it in for about 2 months and the jewelry is still fine!</li>
      <li>It could have been but okay for what I got.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen ppl complain about the clamps, but any roughness wouldn&#x27;t be touching your skin anyway.</li>
      <li>Thabks you we love it</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the packaging though.</li>
      <li>I wish I could&#x27;ve gotten two more septum rings in place of the two nose rings</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Really loved this kit, I didn&#x27;t use the clamps because they were pretty bulky</li>
      <li>Pretty good for being so cheap.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the most important thing.</li>
      <li>Pierced my septum and other people too and it was excellent.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s fine because my piercing is an 18g.</li>
      <li>but I guess that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>but i pierce my nose for no reason because the jewelry didn&#x27;t fit</li>
      <li>I liked the fact that I could easily slide the earring poky back side through the needle and easily slide the needle out without having to hurry and put the earring in, since it was in the needle and was already inserted in the ear!    </li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re brave enough to do it yourself or have a capable friend you trust, go for it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s defiantly a good kit to get for someone who is just starting piercings.</li>
      <li>Everything came in nicely packaged, completely sterile.</li>
      <li>(I made sure it was slanted more to the other side of my nose to get the piercing a more slanted look instead of upward.</li>
      <li>luckily there was a bunch of needles</li>
      <li>this product was worth the amount</li>
      <li>Cheaper than getting it done professionally, and pretty easy!</li>
      <li>Was a good product I bought one from another company and still haven&#x27;t received it due to shipping problems but this shipping was fast if I remember correctly overall good product with sterilized needles</li>
      <li>The kit is perfect ridiculously affordable!</li>
      <li>pierced the right side of my nose</li>
      <li>Love this, would definitely repurchase!</li>
      <li>Came with everything exactly as I ordered</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just that there shouldn&#x27;t have been a nose screw maybe an L stud would be better for people first starting.</li>
      <li>So this kit came in 5 days, and was exactly what I needed to pierce my nose.</li>
      <li>You are pretty much just paying for the needles and gloves..</li>
      <li>This went in MUCH easier because of the straight shape.</li>
      <li>is not the one in the picture and to pierce your nose you need a straight nose ring not curved</li>
      <li>It was fast.</li>
      <li>Real surgical steel.</li>
      <li>Wraped up properly, and clean and sterilized already.</li>
      <li>But, even though it didn&#x27;t include the nose hoop, I am so happy I at least got to pierce a 3rd hole in my ear.    </li>
      <li>it was too upward and was obviously not done right, so I pierced the left side of my nose with the extra 18g needle (Thank goodness they gave me one) and pierced it more at a slanted angle</li>
      <li>The clamps weren&#x27;t in a box to protect them, it looked like everything was pretty much thrown into the yellow envelope.</li>
      <li>it was well worth the price, although I prefer a different type of forceps</li>
      <li>The clamps are a little on the cheap side but thats not really a big problem.</li>
      <li>But other than that I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>

<li> But other than that I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
<li> wish this kit was a little more predictable, wondering whether or not your getting a nose hoop or metal clamps or extra needles, it sucks.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t take long to ship in n</li>
<li> Other that that the jewelry seems a bit big compared to the needles</li>
<li> and it was everything I expected.</li>
<li> Everything was included and it arrived way faster than I expected.</li>
<li> I would VERY MUCH RECOMMEND getting normal nose ring studs if you are going to pierce your nose, because if you&#x27;ve never had a nose screw or any experience with it, you&#x27;re going to have a very difficult time trying to put it in and might be like me, not being prepared, and wasted that 18g needle.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really difficult to put a nose screw in yourself when you first pierce it.</li>
<li> The needles are sooo sharp.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that I received a 14 and 18 gauge before, rather than a 16 and 18.</li>
<li> I pierced my nose for NO REASON because I didn&#x27;t prepare for a normal nose stud because the nose screw was too complicated.</li>
<li> It does feel a little soar now.    </li>
<li> (: it sticks out the bottom a little bit</li>
<li> I tried to break the little spiral (rainbow) shape at the bottom and it would not break.    </li>
<li> Instead of the hoop i received something similar to a stud and the hoop is the only ring I wanted from the package so that&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
<li> The jewelry does not fit in the needle.</li>
<li> and I would have to try again in a few weeks.</li>
<li> I was not able to get the nose screw through with all the pain in the world.</li>
<li> cause I never liked where I put it on my nose</li>
<li> However, I at least knew that going in</li>
<li> The only problem that I would be cautious of when purchasing is that it is very difficult to put in the provided rings.</li>
<li> But sadly I got a cheaper type of clamp &amp;#34;forceps&amp;#34; so I decided to use the metal one they gave me before because I felt it would be less painful when I actually pierced my nose</li>
<li> the jewelry is not good quality at all</li>
<li> And I literally mean, I didn&#x27;t even feel a pinch!</li>
<li> If you purchase this kit, buy some piercing jewelry because what they supply is too bloody big for the hole in the flipping needle!</li>
<li> The clip scissory-looking thing made it SO much less painful</li>
<li> Very bad experience today, blood all over the place, the hole in the needle is to small to hold the jewelry they supplied in the kit.</li>
<li> I am disappointed since no nose hoop came, and they tried to add a 14g needle to substitute for that.</li>
<li> So because I was angered that I pierced my nose for no reason, I decided to pierce my ears with the 16g needle today.</li>

    <li> I like is but I&#x27;m the forceps but I do have my own. It came with everything but I wish it came with a 13g needle for the 14 gauge piercings.</li>
    <li> Was a good product I bought one from another company and still haven&#x27;t received it due to shipping problems but this shipping was fast if I remember correctly overall good product with sterilized needles</li>
    <li> If you need a kit, this is the best deal. I&#x27;ve seen ppl complain about the clamps, but any roughness wouldn&#x27;t be touching your skin anyway. Love this, would definitely repurchase!</li>

    <li> It could have been but okay for what I got.</li>
    <li> Really loved this kit, I didn&#x27;t use the clamps because they were pretty bulky but otherwise it came with everything all sanitized.</li>
    <li> It was nice I pierced my septum and it looks great and isn&#x27;t infected</li>
    <li> I ordered the kit and it came here in a week, also came with everything it said it would have!</li>
    <li> Great! Had no problem at all</li>
    <li> The jewelry does not fit in the needle. Very bad experience today, blood all over the place, the hole in the needle is to small to hold the jewelry they supplied in the kit. If I hadn&#x27;t used one of the needles I would return everything for a refund. If you purchase this kit, buy some piercing jewelry because what they supply is too bloody big for the hole in the flipping needle!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t include the L-Shaped nose ring but everything went well</li>
    <li> Cheaper than getting it done professionally, and pretty easy! The clip scissory-looking thing made it SO much less painful (I used the 18g one), and I triple pierced one ear. It was great, didn&#x27;t get infected, and months later, is perfect. If you&#x27;re brave enough to do it yourself or have a capable friend you trust, go for it!</li>
    <li> Everything was included and it arrived way faster than I expected. The kit is perfect ridiculously affordable! Love it</li>

    <li> i was so happy i got the kit but i pierce my nose for no reason because the jewelry didn&#x27;t fit -,- i used the 18g needle in the kit to pierce my nose</li>
    <li> Really good buy! It only took threw days to get to me and i had standard shipping. It was fast. Pierced my septum and other people too and it was excellent. The clamps are a little on the cheap side but thats not really a big problem. Needle was perfect and so was the jewelry. The gloves were too big for my hands but i have baby hands so...</li>
    <li> Was a good kit. My only problem is the needle Dosnt screw into the item for pircing.</li>
    <li> I like the kit, but, it took longer to get here like I thought it would. I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the packaging though. The clamps weren&#x27;t in a box to protect them, it looked like everything was pretty much thrown into the yellow envelope. But other than that I can&#x27;t really complain. It&#x27;s defiantly a good kit to get for someone who is just starting piercings.</li>
    <li> Everything I specifically asked for was sent to me ,customer service was great only problem is the horseshoe jewelry for my septum was way to big it was a 14 gauge and I needed a smaller one</li>
    <li> Everything is very great quality and very sterile. My only problem is that I got the stud and septum ring but didn&#x27;t receive the regular nose hoop. Instead of the hoop i received something similar to a stud and the hoop is the only ring I wanted from the package so that&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this item. The addition to clamps (forceps) I used was ice, so it was basically painless when I pierced my nose. The only part I felt was the poke at the bottom.    I am disappointed since no nose hoop came, and they tried to add a 14g needle to substitute for that. I pierced my nose for NO REASON because I didn&#x27;t prepare for a normal nose stud because the nose screw was too complicated. I was not able to get the nose screw through with all the pain in the world. I tried to break the little spiral (rainbow) shape at the bottom and it would not break.    The kit included :  -Gloves  -18g needle  -16g needle  -14g needle  -Forceps \\&quot;clamps\\&quot;  -Septum ring  -Labret type ring  -Nose screw  NO NOSE HOOP.    UPDATE :    So because I was angered that I pierced my nose for no reason, I decided to pierce my ears with the 16g needle today. I am very impressed with no pain! And I literally mean, I didn&#x27;t even feel a pinch! (All I felt was the wierdness of it ripping through my skin).     I liked the fact that I could easily slide the earring poky back side through the needle and easily slide the needle out without having to hurry and put the earring in, since it was in the needle and was already inserted in the ear!    Like I said PAINLESS! It does feel a little soar now.    But, even though it didn&#x27;t include the nose hoop, I am so happy I at least got to pierce a 3rd hole in my ear.    I would VERY MUCH RECOMMEND getting normal nose ring studs if you are going to pierce your nose, because if you&#x27;ve never had a nose screw or any experience with it, you&#x27;re going to have a very difficult time trying to put it in and might be like me, not being prepared, and wasted that 18g needle.</li>
    <li> this product was worth the amount u pay I did my ear lip and nose</li>
    <li> Came with everything listed sterile and well sealed. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
    <li> My Daughters are having a bowl with this item l guest it was a great buy and a bargain too👌</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to ship in n it was well worth the price, although I prefer a different type of forceps these did the job. I wish I could&#x27;ve gotten two more septum rings in place of the two nose rings but all in all I love my piercing!</li>
    <li> My package came today with nothing but a pair of gloves.</li>
    <li> Came with everything exactly as I ordered</li>
    <li> This kit was great. Everything was as advertised. The only issue I had was that it said that it works for ears, which it does, but doesn&#x27;t have the jewelry for it. You end up with jewelry you don&#x27;t need, and without jewelry you may want. However, I at least knew that going in and it was everything I expected.</li>
    <li> very happy with my order:)</li>
    <li> So this kit came in 5 days, and was exactly what I needed to pierce my nose. It was packed well, and everything was sealed in their sterilized packages. The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is that there was no 18 gauge needle, which is what I wanted for my nose. I stead there were two 16 gauge needles. It turned out great anyway, because the 16 gauge made it easier to get the 18 gauge nostril screw in my nose. Very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> It came without the needles. That&#x27;s the most important thing.</li>
    <li> I got this kit to pierce my nose.. nose screw it came with is not the one in the picture and to pierce your nose you need a straight nose ring not curved it will not go in correctly. You are pretty much just paying for the needles and gloves..which you can get cheaper.. the jewelry is not good quality at all</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and the needles are in excellent condition, except the jewellery is of very cheap cuality/material.</li>
    <li> Everything in picture, was in my package. Wraped up properly, and clean and sterilized already. Real surgical steel. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!!! they came on time and everything was there. luckily there was a bunch of needles cause I never liked where I put it on my nose and I would have to try again in a few weeks. Had it in for about 2 months and the jewelry is still fine!(: it sticks out the bottom a little bit but that&#x27;s cause it&#x27;s low on my nose</li>
    <li> Pretty good for being so cheap. Only one thing that bothered me way that it says you get 2 16g needles and 2 18g needles. I got 2 18g needles 1 14g and 1 16g. The reason I bought this was because I needed both 16g needles. So that was a bummer. Other that that the jewelry seems a bit big compared to the needles but I guess that&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I LOVED THE STARTER SET THING</li>
    <li> I received this item before and had some troubles piercing my nose...So I decided to once again try it and this time I received 2 extra needles! An extra 18g and 14g. I also received the nose hoop unlike before. But sadly I got a cheaper type of clamp &amp;#34;forceps&amp;#34; so I decided to use the metal one they gave me before because I felt it would be less painful when I actually pierced my nose...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pierced the right side of my nose but a day later I figured out it was too upward and was obviously not done right, so I pierced the left side of my nose with the extra 18g needle (Thank goodness they gave me one) and pierced it more at a slanted angle (I made sure it was slanted more to the other side of my nose to get the piercing a more slanted look instead of upward. It turned out wonderful! I just hope it doesn&#x27;t get infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this kit was a little more predictable, wondering whether or not your getting a nose hoop or metal clamps or extra needles, it sucks.</li>
    <li> Thabks you we love it</li>
    <li> Five stars. The needles are sooo sharp. I did my nose with no problem and no pain. The only problem that I would be cautious of when purchasing is that it is very difficult to put in the provided rings. I kept getting the nose screw and hoop tangled in my nose. I had to put an earring in it while I went to the store to buy an L-shaped stud. This went in MUCH easier because of the straight shape. All in all, this is a great kit and you cant beat the price! Just maybe plan to purchase alternative jewelry to go with it.</li>
