<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent value for the price.  Was a gift for my daughter-in-law.  She was thrilled.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I wanted at a lower price than Saks. It arrived earlier than promised and I receive compliments daily. I&#x27;m very happy and actually ended up ordering the Peace and found New York reasonably priced so I ordered it as well. Love both fragrances!</li>
    <li> Look like original but smell for a few seconds, way far from the original that smells the hole day.  I regret spending money on this. Only Bond in NY or Sacks sells original.</li>
    <li> I cannot see anyone not liking this scent. Its soft and smooth while still perking one&#x27;s interest. After trying all the bonds, this is one of my top picks for a female. If you are looking to try your first bond frag, this is your best choice since it isnt as POW in your face as a lot of the others. And I guess that is why it is the scent of peace.</li>
    <li> Beautifol scent, smelled all of the bond scents at sac&#x27;s in L.V. and loved this one. Light seductive tones and paid less at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great smelling, I am not allergic to it as I am to many perfumes, and she LOVES it... &#x27;Nuff said :)</li>
    <li> It smells awesome very soft very good quality!! My wife is very happy and all her friends comment about the smell of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is such a pretty scent that can be used for men or women.  The fragrance is very long lasting.  It is expensive but you don&#x27;t have to use too much so it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Another brilliant purchase!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite scent.  I purchased this for her as a present and she loves it.  Much better price than the big stores.  I recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> absolutely amazing...drives me nuts when my wife wears it</li>
    <li> A very soft smell ... but the smell is  Breathtaking</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for 3 years now and never tire of it.  If you wear it just be prepared to constantly be told how great you smell and be asked what scent are you wearing.  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I have had Scent of peace before. The price is better on Amazon. People always ask what I am wearing, it does not fade away during the day,  Love it,</li>
    <li> This was not the real thing. I paid $160 for a knock off. I have the one from saks and this is a toilette replica version</li>
    <li> Lovely scent.  Smells like a Lady to me.  Classy, yet still a tad bit sexy, too. Arrived in perfect condition, and in great time as well.  Nothing but a good experience with this seller.  Nice job, y&#x27;all.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s terrible! the smell is nothing. If you wear it on, the smell would be gone for few minutes after. You only can smell it if you put your nose close to the place you just spray on.&lt;br /&gt;honestly, it is almost like WATER!!!&lt;br /&gt;The PRICE way too FAR from the QUALITY of the item. it makes me feel like this is the fake one.</li>
    <li> Im very satisfied with the delivery of this product to Puerto Rico.  I recommend to all women innthe Caribbean to try it. It&#x27;s really a scent of peace.  Thank for the great service and i will be buying more very soon!</li>
    <li> It is what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Lasts all day long with one spray!!</li>
    <li> Was a little nervous but the product I bought, Bond no 9 Scent of Peace, was authentic and just as described. Wasn&#x27;t a tester, came with a box, no problems with shipping. Would buy from again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but it was entirely too expensive!</li>
    <li> It is so nice. It makes me feel good.  This fragrance also is patriotic.  9-11-2011 was a turning point for me. Let&#x27;s never forget.</li>
    <li> Great perfume. makes every female happy</li>
    <li> Wonderful, fresh scent!</li>
    <li> This is such a fabulous fragrance. One of my favorite Bond number 9 fragrances.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Love this combination of scents. Very romantic and flowery perfume.</li>
