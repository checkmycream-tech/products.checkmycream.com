    <li> My friend started wearing this perfume and I loved how it smelled.  I bought this bottle and I cannot believe how long it has lasted.  I used it almost every day and it looks like it will last about a year.  I get complements on how it smells on me, so I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>

    <li> It arrived on Time. I gave it three stars because I don&#x27;t like the scent. I gave it to my aunt as a gift.  Make sure your familiar with the scent before ordering</li>
    <li> i really love how this fragrance smells&lt;br /&gt;is kinda unisex, woody but floral</li>

    <li> I love it!! Have to order more!</li>
    <li> My sister in law purchased this a few days ago and me, being the perfume addict that I am, I ran and grabbed it from her so I can smell it. I fell in LOVEEE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered mine that very moment. Can&#x27;t wait till it arrives</li>
    <li> Recived bigger bottle than advertised, but the atomitizer came damaged. It still sprays but purchased as a gift.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the perfume! I did not expect the bottle to be as big as it was for the price, it was almost a steal!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter for Valentine&#x27;s Day this year. After lots of research, but not going to the store to smell and then buy, this seemed to fit the bill so I took the gamble. I was not disappointed. Neither was my daughter! It smells great on her, lasts all day, the bottle is gorgeous as is the bracelet. Can&#x27;t beat the price, either!</li>
    <li> I am a Juicy Couture addict.  I couldn&#x27;t pass up the price for this! 3.4FL for this price was AMAZING.  Came just as described and looked online.  If you are a Juicy Couture lover like I am, get this for your collection! Smells great.</li>

    <li> Smells like a field of daisies on a sunny day.  I really like . An added favorite to my collection</li>
    <li> SMELL REALLY GOOD IT&#x27;S A SHORT TIME OF STANDING POWER DO SO YOU HAVE TO PUT MORE ON</li>
    <li> I usually wear Marc Jacobs and I love the smell but sometimes it&#x27;s a little bit pricey, since I wear perfume everyday. So this is a better price and smells awesome! Must have.....</li>
