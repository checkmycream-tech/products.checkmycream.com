### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It sticks to our tile perfectly.</li>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not used to the wonderful non-skin-drying advantage of softened water, you imagine all sorts of things.</li>
      <li>This product is the best thing I have bought.</li>
      <li>Very good purchase.</li>
      <li>The attachments for the shower are great.  </li>
      <li>I am happy with this handle....</li>
      <li>Give me all the flexibiity I need to do a great job in the shower.  </li>
      <li>These handles are great if you have a fiberglass wall or tiled shower area.</li>
      <li>It seemed to be good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still delighted with this handle</li>
      <li>Purchased this for my father who is a Senior Citizen and put it in the bath,  at this time it seems to be holding up good.</li>
      <li>I find these wonderful since I am getting older and have a water-softener in my home.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had one guest say that oil was in the water and another mention how glad he was that I had a couple of these since my bathtub was slippery.</li>
      <li>so I bought one more.  </li>
      <li>It could work better, instead of on occasion.</li>
      <li>I have attached it to the wall of the unit near the outer edge where it&#x27;s an ideal balance point as I step over the side of the tub.  </li>
      <li>The price is better than drug store or health equipment stores.</li>
      <li>Invest in something with a better record.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
      <li>It might work on porcelain surfaces, but it sure does not work on fiberglas.  </li>
      <li>On my fiberglass walls, they are sturdy for many months but do loosen up after time.  </li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
      <li>I am buying two more this weekend.  </li>
      <li>Everything was fine for probably two more weeks</li>
      <li>Honestly, that is why I thought the idea at first of Get</li>
      <li>and it seemed secure.  </li>
      <li>In order for the suction cups to stay, strongly, in place the cups and the wall must be EXTREMELY clean.  </li>
      <li>Also, easy to remove in order to clean underneath the handle.</li>
      <li>She is fine, but honestly it isn&#x27;t really worth the money</li>
      <li>The area was very clean when I attached it and doesn&#x27;t get hit with much water.  </li>
      <li>I have subsequently purchased two of the 17 inch Safe-er-Grip bars based on great Amazon reviews and, so far, they are holding well.  </li>
      <li>The other cup maintained good suction, exactly as the originally defective item had.  </li>
      <li>When it has come down to As Seen On TV products, there are some that are good and really worth the money you spend on, and others that aren&#x27;t really worth the money.</li>
      <li>I was searching for a safe way to get a stable exit from our deep spa tub.  </li>
      <li>When first installed it seemed to grip the surface, but it very soon became evident that it would not reliably adhere to the fiberglas surface in a reliable manner.  </li>
      <li>The product is very secure and the color coding lets you know when it is coming loose.</li>
      <li>and I certainly can not recommend it to anyone.    </li>
      <li>I was able to quickly reset the tab which corrected that by firmly reattaching the suction cup.  </li>
      <li>That really is what I think.</li>
      <li>Hold very well in that environment, lost suction 2 or 3 times in a year.</li>
      <li>So I returned it for credit and bought another because I really wanted two.  </li>
      <li>The softener really changes the wetness in the shower.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s on my shower wall just as tight now as when I first installed it more than a month</li>
      <li>I realize now that my original shower did not have enough handles and these strudy grip suction mounts make the shower safer.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about how it will perform on a surface different from the smooth plastic of my tub unit, but I can recommend it highly for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12/13/10.  </li>
      <li>Finally, I thought to clean the suction cups, themselves, with rubbing alcohol.  </li>
      <li>My Safe-er-Grips continue to hold just fine, so far, but only time will tell.</li>
      <li>For older people like myself, I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone.</li>
      <li>People, especial older people depend on this to stabilize themselves in the tub.</li>
      <li>Having the \\&quot;Get A Grip\\&quot; for about one year, I depend on it, and highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Finally, the area must be prepared with a clean, soft rag, using rubbing alcohol.  </li>
      <li>Better be Smith tile or whoops down you go!</li>
      <li>I applied it to a clean dry shower wall</li>
      <li>A Grip was a great concept, but I was absolutely wrong.</li>
      <li>The next time I showered, the top cup was loose, so I also reattached it.  </li>
      <li>To be sure, I always give the grip a little tug, just to be sure neither of the cups are loose, before putting any heavy pressure on the bar.</li>
      <li>In addition, it was certainly not an attractive addition to our bath with the bright blue color used on the mechanism.  </li>
      <li>I really recommend buying either another handle for the bathroom, or finding another product that gives you extra leverage when you need</li>
      <li>ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to reattach it from time to time, but so far, it&#x27;s on there like it&#x27;s screwed in.  </li>
      <li>my only slight dislike is that it is short so the Safe-ER Grip handles are more comfortable for the shower because they allow you to move your hands up and down a little as you wash.  </li>
      <li>After that fall, you can bet I&#x27;m extra careful, and before I put my weight on it each time, I give it a tug to make sure it is still firmly attached.  </li>
      <li>My elderly husband is on dialysis and can barely walk.  </li>
      <li>The above comments have been heard frequently by the company that installed it and maintains it and my reverse-osmosis once a year.</li>
      <li>I even tried it on a smooth metal file cabinet and a thick piece of plexiglass, but it had lost its grip for whatever reason and would not attach to any surfaces.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used suction devices in the kitchen near the stove where steaming pots eventually cause them to come loose, so I am careful with this handle and will continue to be, but it has really helped me enter and exit the tub since I&#x27;ve had it</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how hard it was to push the attachment tabs down, but that gave me confidence that it was achieving a strong suction, and has it ever.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The image and text make you suppose this is a grip that could hold body weight.  Not so. When you get the product, tucked inside the package (not on the cover), is a warning that you should not use it for such things as lifting yourself out of a tub.  So we had to send it back.  We had to pay the return postage, but did get a refund.</li>
    <li> Having the \\&quot;Get A Grip\\&quot; for about one year, I depend on it, and highly recommend it.  In order for the suction cups to stay, strongly, in place the cups and the wall must be EXTREMELY clean.  Every bit of dirt, and soap scum, must be removed.  Finally, the area must be prepared with a clean, soft rag, using rubbing alcohol.  When I moved into a new apartment, recently, I had trouble with the bar coming loose, very frequently.  Finally, I thought to clean the suction cups, themselves, with rubbing alcohol.  Now, the grip has held for over three weeks.  I am buying two more this weekend.  To be sure, I always give the grip a little tug, just to be sure neither of the cups are loose, before putting any heavy pressure on the bar.</li>
    <li> When it has come down to As Seen On TV products, there are some that are good and really worth the money you spend on, and others that aren&#x27;t really worth the money. That really is what I think. Honestly, that is why I thought the idea at first of Get A Grip was a great concept, but I was absolutely wrong. The idea of it being a sturdy handle for the bathtub and bathroom would help my elderly mom whom has multiple sclerosis get out of the bathtub. Sadly, I was deeply mistaken. Not only did the handle break off from its grip after less than an hour, but because of the handle not being firm enough, my mother nearly feel in the tub, and almost hurt herself. She is fine, but honestly it isn&#x27;t really worth the money the Get A Grip claims it is. I really recommend buying either another handle for the bathroom, or finding another product that gives you extra leverage when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: D-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convince: F&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: F+</li>
    <li> I bought one of these while away from home recently as something to help maintain my balance in the shower.  It seemed to be good so I bought one more.  Then, a few days later, one end of one of them lost its grip on the tile and nothing would restore it.  So I returned it for credit and bought another because I really wanted two.  Everything was fine for probably two more weeks and then one of them had a repeat of the same problem-one end would not maintain suction on the tile wall.  I even tried it on a smooth metal file cabinet and a thick piece of plexiglass, but it had lost its grip for whatever reason and would not attach to any surfaces.  The other cup maintained good suction, exactly as the originally defective item had.  One of the three continues to stay firmly on the tile wall and only time will tell how it does.  Overall, I believe this item is a dud and not worth purchasing and I certainly can not recommend it to anyone.    These items are failing without any undue weight or force on them.  They are only being used as something to hold to maintain balance in a shower.  No force or stress whatever.    I have subsequently purchased two of the 17 inch Safe-er-Grip bars based on great Amazon reviews and, so far, they are holding well.  Only time will tell their value but I attach a lot of credence to Amazon reviews and are hoping they hold up well.    Final update:  It&#x27;s unanimous---my third and final one of these items has failed identically to the previous two.  One cup loses suction and will not adhere to any surface.  If I could give these a 0 star rating I would.  Invest in something with a better record.  My Safe-er-Grips continue to hold just fine, so far, but only time will tell.</li>
    <li> After a fall in the shower, my sister sent me this as a gift and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I have a plastic shower/tub unit to which it attached so tightly, I felt like I would pull the unit out of the wall before pulling this handle off.  I was surprised at how hard it was to push the attachment tabs down, but that gave me confidence that it was achieving a strong suction, and has it ever.  After that fall, you can bet I&#x27;m extra careful, and before I put my weight on it each time, I give it a tug to make sure it is still firmly attached.  It is.  It&#x27;s on my shower wall just as tight now as when I first installed it more than a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to reattach it from time to time, but so far, it&#x27;s on there like it&#x27;s screwed in.  I have attached it to the wall of the unit near the outer edge where it&#x27;s an ideal balance point as I step over the side of the tub.  The area was very clean when I attached it and doesn&#x27;t get hit with much water.  I&#x27;ve used suction devices in the kitchen near the stove where steaming pots eventually cause them to come loose, so I am careful with this handle and will continue to be, but it has really helped me enter and exit the tub since I&#x27;ve had it and I&#x27;m extremely pleased. I don&#x27;t know about how it will perform on a surface different from the smooth plastic of my tub unit, but I can recommend it highly for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12/13/10.  Finally after 6 months I noticed the lower cup had come loose when I tugged the handle before putting my weight on it.  I was able to quickly reset the tab which corrected that by firmly reattaching the suction cup.  The next time I showered, the top cup was loose, so I also reattached it.  The handle has stayed reattached firmly for almost two weeks at this point. I&#x27;m still delighted with this handle and if it ever gets to the point of not reattaching well, I&#x27;ll buy another since it as given me extra security in entering and leaving my shower.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these after an orthopedic surgery but now I don&#x27;t know what I did without them.  I realize now that my original shower did not have enough handles and these strudy grip suction mounts make the shower safer.  The price is better than drug store or health equipment stores.</li>
    <li> My elderly husband is on dialysis and can barely walk.  I purchased this grip to help him in the shower.  I applied it to a clean dry shower wall and it seemed secure.  During the night I heard a crash, and rushed into the bathroom to discover that the grab bar had popped off the wall.  I tried to apply it to several other surfaces, but it would not cling to vinyl, wood or tile permanently.  This product could have caused a terrible accident and I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> The attachments for the shower are great.  Give me all the flexibiity I need to do a great job in the shower.  Also helps during the toweling off.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Have three!</li>
    <li> It could work better, instead of on occasion. People, especial older people depend on this to stabilize themselves in the tub.</li>
    <li> These handles are great if you have a fiberglass wall or tiled shower area. On my fiberglass walls, they are sturdy for many months but do loosen up after time.  Only takes 5 seconds to resecure to walls.  Everytime I shower I check them to see if they are still attached, and if not, I reattach.  For older people like myself, I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this handle....my only slight dislike is that it is short so the Safe-ER Grip handles are more comfortable for the shower because they allow you to move your hands up and down a little as you wash.  I am using this on the outside of the shower next to the door as a prop for my husband to enter the shower.</li>
    <li> would not stick to shower had to return it</li>
    <li> Very good purchase. It sticks to our tile perfectly. Also, easy to remove in order to clean underneath the handle.</li>
    <li> I find these wonderful since I am getting older and have a water-softener in my home. The softener really changes the wetness in the shower. I&#x27;ve had one guest say that oil was in the water and another mention how glad he was that I had a couple of these since my bathtub was slippery. If you&#x27;re not used to the wonderful non-skin-drying advantage of softened water, you imagine all sorts of things. The above comments have been heard frequently by the company that installed it and maintains it and my reverse-osmosis once a year.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a safe way to get a stable exit from our deep spa tub.  This item appeared to be just what I needed.  When first installed it seemed to grip the surface, but it very soon became evident that it would not reliably adhere to the fiberglas surface in a reliable manner.  The unit simply cannot be trusted to operate as advertised.  I consider it dangerous because with the slightest strain it releases.  This could result in a nasty fall if you tried to rely on it.  It might work on porcelain surfaces, but it sure does not work on fiberglas.  In addition, it was certainly not an attractive addition to our bath with the bright blue color used on the mechanism.  However, I could have lived with the color if it had worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 before I ordered these 2 extras. I used them in my moulded bathroom showers. Hold very well in that environment, lost suction 2 or 3 times in a year.</li>
    <li> This product is the best thing I have bought. My shower/tub floor is textured but slippery when exiting the tub. The product is very secure and the color coding lets you know when it is coming loose. I will buy this again and again!</li>
    <li> Better be Smith tile or whoops down you go! I bought them  a few yrs ago and they sit in the garage with all my other junk!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my father who is a Senior Citizen and put it in the bath,  at this time it seems to be holding up good.</li>
