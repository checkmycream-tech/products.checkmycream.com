### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best choice for the price.</li>
      <li>It still charges and runs, but does not cut hair at all, now it just tugs on it (awesome).  </li>
      <li>Great product and timely shipping.</li>
      <li>works great as a beard trimmer if you are on the go aned need a trim in a hurry this product will be great for you.</li>
      <li>The GOOD model I have is the Wahl 9876.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great product, just don&#x27;t drop it as blade breaks easily.</li>
      <li>liked that</li>
      <li>PRETTY GOOD!</li>
      <li>The first Rechargeable Beard Trimmer did not hold even one charge, so I returned it through Amazon&#x27;s great return policy.  </li>
      <li>This is a very cheap trimmer.  </li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t hold a charge, feels very cheaply made and if I had the package or receipt I would return it.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for something better then an electric razor for my husband for his birthday because he never likes to shave because he gets razor burn.</li>
      <li>, he is pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Especially how it feels like a toy you would get in a happy meal even more so when compared to the good Wahl trimmer I had that I thought died (but</li>
      <li>It works OK, so I give Wahl 5598 Rechargeable Beard Trimmer a 3 star.</li>
      <li>I love it too.</li>
      <li>I cut myself more than once using it for 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Get a better groomer.</li>
      <li>Have had this Wahl 5598 beard trimmer for about 18 months and whilst not as good as the (larger-mains operated) Wahl NAC, in terms of speed and trim performance, it was very handy to take when travelling and being rechargeable was even more space-saving and lighter, especially when I did not want to use the mains-operated trimmer.</li>
      <li>It has a light, cheap feel.  </li>
      <li>We had a Wahl hair trimmer for along time and would use that and liked it so much</li>
      <li>Noisy - the attachments with the one I purchased fit well except the five position guide.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
      <li>Very loud,too big,but mostly runs out of juice very quickly.</li>
      <li>I was familiar with the Wahl trimmer which is why I ordered it.  </li>
      <li>This was my first beard trimmer and in general I was happy with the product and the price.</li>
      <li>I purchased this at CVS and thought Wahl made some tremendous quality of shaver, but this somehow was not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ironically I have an other good Wahl beard trimmer that all I needed to do was order another user replaceable rechargeable battery for, which I just did.  </li>
      <li>For the price it is suitable with a solid plastic feel and otherwise unimpressive beard and mustache trimmer.  </li>
      <li>And it was the right price and came really fast.</li>
      <li>However, like quite a lot of other users, recharging does not seem to work effectively any longer, even though I have always follows the instructions and &amp;#34;good practice&amp;#34; for recharging.</li>
      <li>i really recomend</li>
      <li>The Conair stand is very sturdy and is part of the recharging system.  </li>
      <li>Thanks, Patti</li>
      <li>Real piece of junk.</li>
      <li>When my last trimmer died, I need a new one quickly and bought this one from target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I then charged it a few more hours before using it.  </li>
      <li>A tiny red light indicates the system is working.  </li>
      <li>I think I was probably busy and lost them both.  </li>
      <li>a litlle loud</li>
      <li>The second trimmer is working, but the beard trimmer still seems kind of weak.  </li>
      <li>It is very light and feels poorly constructed, and the length of service confirms this.</li>
      <li>It seems to run much slower than other trimmers I have used.  </li>
      <li>I know this is a cheap trimmer, but I would like at least a years use out of something so simple, with one function, that costs $20.</li>
      <li>Plus, I don&#x27;t know what steroid-addled lumberjack served as the guide for the &amp;#34;two-day stubble&amp;#34; setting, but it is far from short enough for that look.</li>
      <li>I previously had a Wahl beard trimmer that lasted for 4 years, but it seems as though their products have really fallen off.</li>

<li> I previously had a Wahl beard trimmer that lasted for 4 years, but it seems as though their products have really fallen off.</li>
<li> The speed changes constantly throughout your shave, regardless of how long it has been charged.</li>
<li> The first time i used it, the thing was slow and would tug on my hair.</li>
<li> The blades are dull and move slowly, and it could never keep a charge for more than 30 seconds.</li>
<li> I am more likely to swear abut them now - only takes a single poor product and lack of customer service to destroy years of built-up reputation!  </li>
<li> After being plugged in for 12 hours it barely held charge for its first use, and now fails to hold any charge for subsequent uses regardless of how long it is plugged in for.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.  </li>
<li> very long battery life.</li>
<li> When the mains trimmer fails, I am unlikely to purchase Wahl products again and that is about having happily purchased from Wahl before, plus my fathers trimmed dogs for over 30 years and swore by Wahl.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Avoid at all costs as they simply don&#x27;t work, and are a total waste of money.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s made in China and certainly appears it has that infamous Chinese quality.  </li>
<li> Tips of some of the blade guide chipped off after only a few uses</li>
<li> a razor sharp surface that continually cuts the skin to the point of bleeding&lt;br /&gt;in spite of (also) using the (supplied) plastic length adapters (which by the way do not fit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;&amp;#34;Poorly designed piece of junk&amp;#34; also describes a couple other Wahl trimmers I have owned over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Impossible to get an even shave with this, created huge bald patches in my beard.  </li>
<li> The speed was so slow that I thought it had not charged enough.  </li>
<li> Slowed down when going through thicker areas.  </li>
<li> This product is unfit for use and obviously does no credit to Wahl and obviously I am unable to recommend to other potential users.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re half done trimming</li>
<li> Painfully and quickly slowed down and caught a bunch of hair in it which I had to pull out.</li>
<li> It is tight and adjust by sliding to the correct detent stops.  </li>
<li> I charged it for a few hours and then decided to use it.  </li>
<li> No movement, no noise, nothing--like it was dead on arrival.</li>
<li> I was shocked to find out that Wahl made such a piece of junk!&lt;br /&gt;Head</li>
<li> Sometimes it slows so much that it stops and catches on the hair, pulling it very painfully.</li>
<li> It never successfully trimmed my beard, nor did it seem like it was designed to.</li>
<li> This is a poorly designed piece of junk.</li>
<li> The base is a storage case only with a place that you can run the cord to connect the power adapter.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m actually surprised at how horrible this thing is.  </li>
<li> By far, this is the worst one ever!  </li>
<li> Trying to avoid Norelco which had weird adjustable attachment that broke rendering it unusable ($25.</li>
<li> But the stand is so flimsy and awkward, even for holding the attachments, not to mention the trimmer, to be of any use.</li>
<li> I bought the trimmer to trim my pubes as i get really bad razor burn...</li>
<li> This is an infuriatingly, painfully bad trimmer.</li>
<li> Stupidly have lost my receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> WORTHLESS PIECE OF S</li>
<li> WORTHLESS.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed in this trimer by Wahl.</li>
<li> THE WORST TRIMMER I EVER</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this at CVS and thought Wahl made some tremendous quality of shaver, but this somehow was not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the reviews of quality, battery, and speed are all correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t purchase. Get a better groomer.</li>
    <li> For the price it is suitable with a solid plastic feel and otherwise unimpressive beard and mustache trimmer.  Noisy - the attachments with the one I purchased fit well except the five position guide. It is tight and adjust by sliding to the correct detent stops.  The base is a storage case only with a place that you can run the cord to connect the power adapter. Did I mention it is noisy.</li>
    <li> I bought the trimmer to trim my pubes as i get really bad razor burn...I cut myself more than once using it for 2 minutes. THE WORST TRIMMER I EVER USED...You SHOULD GET CONAIR THEY&#x27;RE PRETTY GOOD!</li>
    <li> works great as a beard trimmer if you are on the go aned need a trim in a hurry this product will be great for you.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this trimer by Wahl. I would like to send it back but do not have the box. What would be my options.</li>
    <li> Great product and timely shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a poorly designed piece of junk. Its motor started failing within a year of purchase and it is now basically useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Poorly designed piece of junk&amp;#34; also describes a couple other Wahl trimmers I have owned over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again will I purchase anything sold by this company.</li>
    <li> i have used [[ASIN:B00009RF1E Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer]]for several years - 2 trimmers had lasted over 6 years.  I use the trimmers to shave my head every 2 to 3 days.  When my last trimmer died, I need a new one quickly and bought this one from target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one gave out after 2 months.  It still charges and runs, but does not cut hair at all, now it just tugs on it (awesome).  It is very light and feels poorly constructed, and the length of service confirms this.</li>
    <li> This was my first beard trimmer and in general I was happy with the product and the price. However, it recently stopped charging and is now junk.  For as infrequently as I used it I hopped it would have lasted longer. I will not be buying Wahl again.</li>
    <li> Have had this Wahl 5598 beard trimmer for about 18 months and whilst not as good as the (larger-mains operated) Wahl NAC, in terms of speed and trim performance, it was very handy to take when travelling and being rechargeable was even more space-saving and lighter, especially when I did not want to use the mains-operated trimmer. However, like quite a lot of other users, recharging does not seem to work effectively any longer, even though I have always follows the instructions and &amp;#34;good practice&amp;#34; for recharging. When the mains trimmer fails, I am unlikely to purchase Wahl products again and that is about having happily purchased from Wahl before, plus my fathers trimmed dogs for over 30 years and swore by Wahl.  I am more likely to swear abut them now - only takes a single poor product and lack of customer service to destroy years of built-up reputation!  This product is unfit for use and obviously does no credit to Wahl and obviously I am unable to recommend to other potential users.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great product, just don&#x27;t drop it as blade breaks easily. This has happened to me several times, however I just repurchase.</li>
    <li> WORTHLESS. used TWICE, came back to it a month later and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. charged for hours, came back and it ran for about two minutes. Painfully and quickly slowed down and caught a bunch of hair in it which I had to pull out. I know this is a cheap trimmer, but I would like at least a years use out of something so simple, with one function, that costs $20. There is also no way to open it without breaking it to try to replace the battery or check out the motor. Two of my roommates have them and NONE of them will hold charge. WORTHLESS PIECE OF S***. Get something else, never buying Wahl again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this trimmer at Target.  This is a very cheap trimmer.  It has a light, cheap feel.  I charged it for a few hours and then decided to use it.  The speed was so slow that I thought it had not charged enough.  I then charged it a few more hours before using it.  It seems to run much slower than other trimmers I have used.  The speed is also somewhat variable.  It feels like it is going to run out of energy at any moment.  Slowed down when going through thicker areas.  It&#x27;s on its way back to the store.</li>
    <li> After having a Wahl for years, I replaced it with this model. Real piece of junk. Very loud,too big,but mostly runs out of juice very quickly. I&#x27;m trying another Wahl model. Trying to avoid Norelco which had weird adjustable attachment that broke rendering it unusable ($25. to replace attachment!).</li>
    <li> I was familiar with the Wahl trimmer which is why I ordered it.  But the stand is so flimsy and awkward, even for holding the attachments, not to mention the trimmer, to be of any use. Wahl can use a lesson from Conair about trimmer stands.  The Conair stand is very sturdy and is part of the recharging system.  To recharge the trimmer, one simply inserts the trimmer into a prong in the stand and voila!  A tiny red light indicates the system is working.  When needed, the trimmer is simply lifted up from the stand and reinserted when the job is done.  With Wahl, one needs to unplug the trimmer from the charger each time it&#x27;s used and plugged back in afterward.  This is no big deal but the stand is not sturdy enough to hold the trimmer upright while being charged.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing plugged in for about twelve hours now, and turning it on does nothing. No movement, no noise, nothing--like it was dead on arrival.</li>
    <li> Hi, Bought for my son, the wahl brand is what he suggested ,works well., he is pleased with it.  Thanks, Patti</li>
    <li> Buying this was basically throwing money away. After being plugged in for 12 hours it barely held charge for its first use, and now fails to hold any charge for subsequent uses regardless of how long it is plugged in for. I&#x27;ve only had it for a month and may as well throw it away. Stupidly have lost my receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid at all costs as they simply don&#x27;t work, and are a total waste of money. Only giving it 1 star because it is required. Disgraceful.</li>
    <li> The speed changes constantly throughout your shave, regardless of how long it has been charged. Sometimes it slows so much that it stops and catches on the hair, pulling it very painfully. Do not buy this under any circumstances.</li>
    <li> This is not actually a beard trimmer. It never successfully trimmed my beard, nor did it seem like it was designed to. The blades are dull and move slowly, and it could never keep a charge for more than 30 seconds. I previously had a Wahl beard trimmer that lasted for 4 years, but it seems as though their products have really fallen off. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Got this guy at Big Lots for fifteen Washingtons.  It won&#x27;t hold a charge, feels very cheaply made and if I had the package or receipt I would return it.  I think I was probably busy and lost them both.  Ironically I have an other good Wahl beard trimmer that all I needed to do was order another user replaceable rechargeable battery for, which I just did.  I&#x27;m actually surprised at how horrible this thing is.  Especially how it feels like a toy you would get in a happy meal even more so when compared to the good Wahl trimmer I had that I thought died (but found out I can just order a replacement battery).  The GOOD model I have is the Wahl 9876.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something better then an electric razor for my husband for his birthday because he never likes to shave because he gets razor burn. We had a Wahl hair trimmer for along time and would use that and liked it so much but it broke and I wanted to find something that worked liked that and I had no idea that wahl sold Beard trimmers too. And it was the right price and came really fast. I love it too. I also have problems with facial hair being german and I shave with it too.</li>
    <li> This is an infuriatingly, painfully bad trimmer. Plus, I don&#x27;t know what steroid-addled lumberjack served as the guide for the &amp;#34;two-day stubble&amp;#34; setting, but it is far from short enough for that look.</li>
    <li> The best choice for the price. very long battery life. a litlle loud but you will get use to it. i really recomend</li>
    <li> I was shocked to find out that Wahl made such a piece of junk!&lt;br /&gt;Head keeps falling off of trimmer. Tips of some of the blade guide chipped off after only a few uses&lt;br /&gt;leaving a razor sharp surface that continually cuts the skin to the point of bleeding&lt;br /&gt;in spite of (also) using the (supplied) plastic length adapters (which by the way do not fit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last Wahl trimmer lasted 8 years - this one lasted a month before I gave up and threw it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it no stars if i could. The first time i used it, the thing was slow and would tug on my hair. I thought charging it would help, but because there is no indicator, now I don&#x27;t even know if it is charging. I can&#x27;t even open the body to see if i can try to work on the mechanics to get it to work.</li>
    <li> The first Rechargeable Beard Trimmer did not hold even one charge, so I returned it through Amazon&#x27;s great return policy.  The second trimmer is working, but the beard trimmer still seems kind of weak.  It works OK, so I give Wahl 5598 Rechargeable Beard Trimmer a 3 star.</li>
    <li> The attachments somehow don&#x27;t work at all.  Impossible to get an even shave with this, created huge bald patches in my beard.  Avoid!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Wahl trimmers for 30 years.  By far, this is the worst one ever!  It&#x27;s cheap.  Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.  And my personal problem with it is that you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging like earlier Wahl trimmers.  If you&#x27;re half done trimming and it dies, you can&#x27;t finish until it&#x27;s fully charged again.  It&#x27;s made in China and certainly appears it has that infamous Chinese quality.  I wish there was a way to give it zero stars!</li>
