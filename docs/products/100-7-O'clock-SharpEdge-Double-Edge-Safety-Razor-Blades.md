      <li>Received today and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>The best razor for my face when paired to the edwin jagger kelvin.  </li>
      <li>Now if Gillette just made a sharper blade than Wilkinson they would have the best of both worlds (Wilkinson&#x27;s smoothness and Feather&#x27;s sharpness).  </li>

      <li>Blade life is good, I get about 4 shaves out of them.</li>

      <li>Just remember, I find this particular blade to perfect for me and</li>
      <li>All in all, a great blade to add to the rotation and at a pretty good price, $25 for 100ct,</li>

      <li>So far this is the best blade to for me.</li>
      <li>I have over 50 years of shaving under my belt and most of that is with DE Safety Razor&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I could get more shaves out of them, but when you have 600 (with more on the way)</li>
      <li>But this review may help give you some context to decide whether you might love them, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
      <li>I love these blades.</li>
      <li>The blade that I love, may be one you don&#x27;t care for.</li>
      <li>Should be able to tell with one swipe if that is the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, the Dorco remain the best for my job beards, line ups, and designs.</li>
      <li>better.</li>
      <li>I love these blades.</li>
      <li>I knew better but ordered anyway,</li>
      <li>In fact, these blades were an afterthought that I fell in love with.  </li>
      <li>As with all shaving products it&#x27;s always best to try yourself preferably in a sampler pack or such (I know practice what you preach</li>
      <li>I have tried severl brand but have found none for me better than these.  </li>
      <li>Gillete are his favorite safety razor blades..</li>
      <li>My favorite blade.</li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love the blades.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many blades and found these to be my favorites.  </li>
      <li>This gives a better shave and costs pennies a day.</li>
      <li>With the 7 O&#x27;Clock SharpEdges I&#x27;m saving money and getting much better packaging.</li>
      <li>These hold the sharpness through more shaves than the bluebirds do.</li>
      <li>I shave a minimum of 5x per week and many times, 6X.  </li>
      <li>But these are still my favorite.</li>
      <li>i will buy again, there is a reason that gillette is a household name for razors, and their work in safety razors is how they got famous</li>
      <li>These blades are flat, out perfect.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good blades.  </li>
      <li>These have given me one of the best shaves in a long time.</li>
      <li>Cheap in price and one of my favorite blades to shave with</li>
      <li>I had heard so many good things about them, and the general consensus seems to be they are a &amp;#34;Top 5&amp;#34; blade for many people.  </li>
      <li>Not that easy to find sometimes.</li>
      <li>If these blades are your favorite, you will want to buy them in bulk--because that is certainly cheaper than a flight to St Petersburg to buy more.</li>
      <li>If these blades are your favorite, you will want to buy them in bulk--because that is certainly cheaper than a flight to St Petersburg to buy more.</li>
      <li>It is very simple to get a DFS level shave with only two passes with these, although they work great with three passes for the great BBS.</li>
      <li>A smooth shave that is close.  </li>
      <li>However, you must use a light touch and let the razor do the work.  </li>
      <li>These are as a smooth as the Feather is</li>
      <li>Those are also available here on amazon.</li>
      <li>right? :-) )</li>
      <li>The sharpness is great but one of the drawbacks, a minor one, is in the packaging.  </li>
      <li>These blades are made in Russia on the original Gillette machinery.</li>
      <li>Definitely the best blade I have tried so far since switching to a safety razor.</li>
      <li>I really think these are the best deal out there for a super sharp DE blade.</li>
      <li>this was a deal to good to pass up, 100 count blade pack should last quite a while.</li>
      <li>Like I said, the entire 7 O&#x27;Clock line up is quite good.</li>
      <li>These 7 o&#x27;clocks run a close 2nd to my beloved feathers.  </li>
      <li>purchased from Super Safety Razor .</li>
      <li>These and the green Stainless ( also from St. Petersburgh) are the best in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Sharp enough to slice thru the whiskers without pulling and tugging but also incredibly smooth, it&#x27;s a perfectly balanced blade.</li>
      <li>Great on both, a little aggressive on the slanted merkur though.</li>
      <li>However where they really shine is how smooth they shave.</li>
      <li>I have used many so far</li>
      <li>This blade is by far my favorite in the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock line.</li>
      <li>I bought the 100 count pack, which gave me 500 blades or 500 weeks worth of shaving.</li>
      <li>Selection of razor blades is very personal, and I have played with 30+ brands over the years for my own use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great item. Super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These are good blades. They&#x27;re sharp and I can get a decent number of shaves out of them. That said, old fashioned shaving is a fairly personal thing. After trying a few different brands, this is the one that I settled on. If your beard is like mine, average thickness and slightly coarse, then these would work great for you. If you&#x27;re not sure though, you might want to start with a variety pack and try a few different models of razor. Those are also available here on amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been a double edge shaver for just over a year and been trying a lot of different blades to find a good combination for my Merkur 39C Slant Bar.  I have tried Derby, Astra, Wilkinson, Feather and Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock SE and the latter compares to the Feather in sharpness and the Wilkinson for smoothness.  If you read the history of the blade development this make sense.  Wilkinson was one of the first to develop a special coating for their blades and soon surpassed Gillette in blade sales even though Gillette was the dominate player and first to market.  Then Gillette licensed Wilkinson&#x27;s technology and was using their (Wilkinson) coating on their (Gillette) blades.  Now if Gillette just made a sharper blade than Wilkinson they would have the best of both worlds (Wilkinson&#x27;s smoothness and Feather&#x27;s sharpness).  Well this is close to just that.  A blade sharper then Wilkinson and smoother then Feather and on the Merkur Slant this is almost perfect combination.  A smooth shave that is close.  Are these blades sharper than feather I really cannot say that, but what I can say is, that they are so smooth that I can make second and third passes on rough spots (without irritation) that my over all shave is closer.  At about 21 to 25 cents a blade (depending on where purchased) this very good shave at a very good price, but once again your mileage may vary.  Remember DE shaving is both art and science and you will need to find combinations that work best for you.</li>
    <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this deal. I have enough for a whole year - maybe two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other brands, they&#x27;re OK for my beard. The SharpEdge&#x27;s are just a notch above average, but my favorite is the 7 O&#x27;Clock Platinums at a much higher premium (which I also preferred over Feathers - too sharp and dulled too quickly after encountering my pretty full and course stubble).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work well enough where I definitely won&#x27;t toss &#x27;em out, but in the next decade when I finally do run out, I&#x27;ll probably opt for the Platinums instead.</li>
    <li> This was my bad... I like the &amp;#34;green box&amp;#34; 7 o clock razors and saw this &amp;#34;sharpedge&amp;#34; and instantly thought sharp&#x3D;better. I knew better but ordered anyway, these razors are not good for my face. As with all shaving products it&#x27;s always best to try yourself preferably in a sampler pack or such (I know practice what you preach right? :-) )</li>
    <li> I have been experimenting with many other types of safety razor blades, the other brand i use are the Bluebird platinums. These hold the sharpness through more shaves than the bluebirds do. I like both, but i tend to go to these first and alternate. I have used them on an open comb and the slanted merkur. Great on both, a little aggressive on the slanted merkur though.</li>
    <li> Ive been Barbering for a few years now, i always use the dorco brand. These compared to the Dorco in my opinion werent as sharp and dull quicker. Overall, the Dorco remain the best for my job beards, line ups, and designs.</li>
    <li> So far this is the best blade to for me. Very very sharp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than Feather, Derby Extra and Astras.</li>
    <li> They are sharp, fast, and well priced. Not that easy to find sometimes. Not everyone likes the new little featherweight  shavers for sale in bundles today. These blades fit the heavyweights  of old when shavers had heft and distinction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review on my uncle&#x27;s behalf he lives in Columbia in his opinion Gillete are his favorite safety razor blades..</li>
    <li> My favorite blade. Why waste money on the fancy multiblade plastic stuff.  This gives a better shave and costs pennies a day.</li>
    <li> NEVER FOUND A BLADE THAT HELD UP AS WELL AS THIS ONE DIID....EXCELLENT CUTTING...NO FACIAL CUTS OR IRRATATION...VERY NICE BLADE</li>
    <li> These are great and I&#x27;m liking them a bit better than my Feathers.</li>
    <li> Great Razors. I have used many so far but these are the sharpest and also long lasting. I get about 6 to 7 Shaves per razor. My wilkies give me 4 but blades are a personal choice, you really have to try them before ordering in bulk. For me razors blades Like Derby, Murker, Dorco and Feather didn&#x27;t work, either they felt to rough or got some pulling and tugging, or they just lasted two shaves and I don&#x27;t even shave the chin area as i have a goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two favorite blades are these Russian made 7 O&#x27;clock (Yellow Package only) and the Wilkinson swords made in Germany.</li>
    <li> I love these blades. They are extremely sharp! Much sharper than Derby&#x27;s or Lord&#x27;s, just slightly under Feather&#x27;s. However where they really shine is how smooth they shave. Feather&#x27;s tend to be a little harsh. These things just glide. I have very sensitive skin and these are my go to blades.</li>
    <li> SHARP SHARP SHARP. I used to use Astra for the longest time (great blades). Since I started using a shavette I decided to go for something a little higher end. These blades works a treat!</li>
    <li> Obviously since most folks&#x27; mileage varies when it comes to these, I had to try a couple to get to this product. I started out with the Personna Red blades due to the stellar reviews and found out that they weren&#x27;t sharp enough for me and caused more irritation than usual. I then tried Feathers and liked them but found they were a bit too sharp. So, at this point, the Gillette SharpEdge blades seem to be my goldilocks in that they are sharp enough and not quite as aggressive as Feathers. This is my second order and was substantially larger than the first.</li>
    <li> Pretty good blades.  Just not as sharp as Feather brand blades.  For the price these are a great buy.  Also recommend these for rookies learning the DE ropes as these are pretty forgiving.</li>
    <li> I have been using a safety razor for  50 years with a lot of different blades.  This Gillette razor gives an incredible shave. I shave a minimum of 5x per week and many times, 6X.  Each shave consists of two passes, so I guess you can say I shave either 10x or 12x per week.  Each blade lasts about 9-10 days before changing. Now that&#x27;s a razor blade.  Thank you Gillette, you&#x27;ve hit the mark with this blade.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve changed from cartridge shaving, I haven&#x27;t looked back. DE safety razors are a massive improvement. As for these blades in particular, they work for me. I&#x27;ve tried over a dozen different models of blades, but these are the only ones that allow me to shave ATG (against the grain) on my neck and chin without cutting myself or getting razor burn. If you have trouble with sensitive skin, you might give these a try.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: DE blades are a very personal thing and can vary wildly in how they perform for different individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got into wet shaving, and was eager to try these blades.  I had heard so many good things about them, and the general consensus seems to be they are a &amp;#34;Top 5&amp;#34; blade for many people.  I only managed 2 shaves with this particular Gillette blade and it butchered my face.  Left me with serious razor burn and irritation.  I had to give myself several days for my face to heal up before shaving again. The shave itself was not even close to comfortable, it was PAINFUL.  Felt like it was pulling hairs out instead of slicing through them.  This is the only blade I have tried that did this to me, and I was quite surprised by this honestly.  Starting to wonder if I got a &amp;#34;dud&amp;#34; blade and maybe something was just wrong with that one, so I will try another one at some point just to make sure.  Should be able to tell with one swipe if that is the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just to give a different side of the story, don&#x27;t go and buy these in bulk before trying them out first to make sure they will work well for you.  Unfortunately I was in the minority as these were the worst blade of the bunch that I&#x27;ve tried including Feather, Derby, both Astras, Personna blue and red, and even the other 7 O&#x27;clock stainless (green) blade.  My advice, don&#x27;t take anyone&#x27;s word for it regarding DE blades.  Get a sample pack and find what works for you before you stock up on any particular type!</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. A very sharp and smooth razor blade. Works well in different razors. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I get a solid bit of stubble after a day without shaving. These last about 3 shaves per blade if I shave every third or fourth day.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d last longer if I shaved more frequently.</li>
    <li> I have been working my way through double edge blades, trying to find \\&quot;the one\\&quot;.  After trying Merkur, Astra, Feather, Derby, etc...I have hit the mark.  These blades are flat, out perfect.  They are incredibly sharp, like a feather, but seem to last much longer (5 shaves).  I also get way less irritation when shaving against the grain.  Really a quality blade, at a price that is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> these blades are a very good balance of value and cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are very sharp, not feather sharp but in many ways that is a good thing and nicks and cuts are less likely.&lt;br /&gt;also they cost about 30% less and as far as i can observe they last about 1-2 more shaves past my typical feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall i will buy again, there is a reason that gillette is a household name for razors, and their work in safety razors is how they got famous so how could these not be good?</li>
    <li> Excellent with a milder razor. I use these with a Merkur 180, the El-Cheapo Rimei, and a (not-so-mild) 1930 AAMCO open-comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as temperamental as a Feather, yet keener than an Astra (for ME, that is.) I plan to always have these in my shaving cabinet,</li>
    <li> These are as a smooth as the Feather is but they don&#x27;t dull nearly as fast, I haven&#x27;t notice the typical tugging with this blade as I have with many other blades. My typical close shaves last 2 days before needing to shave again, with these blades it is no different, they aren&#x27;t as aggressive as my Favorite feather is and it doesnt seem to affect how they do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Merkur 20011 DE razor and Klar shave soap, been shaving for 2 years with a DE and I wouldn&#x27;t go back to cartridge razors for anything other shaving body hair off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying these again in future this was a deal to good to pass up, 100 count blade pack should last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Being new to DE blades and wet shaving I bought into the lie that Feathers were the best blades you can get. That is so wrong. The Feathers aren&#x27;t all that so I kept looking and happened across these and gave them a try. Not only were they very sharp they were exceptionally smooth. I have tried other brands and types of blades since then. But these are still my favorite. They are worth considering. I have sensitive skin and these are sharp as well as gentle.</li>
    <li> The best razor for my face when paired to the edwin jagger kelvin.  Shaving nirvana.  Sharp as a feather but no cuts.</li>
    <li> Bought a sampler pack and really likes these blades.So I bought 100 and am happy with the purchase.Also bought 100 Derby&#x27;s for like 8.00.I rotate but find the 7.s much smoother on the skin.</li>
    <li> Razor Blades are a personal item.  These are the only blades that I have found that can give me a close shave without tearing up my face.  I have tried severl brand but have found none for me better than these.  Remember if you are going to purchase razor blades you need to be careful and make sure the brand fits your face,  all blades are not created equal.  A diffenrance of as little as .001 in can cause you discomefort.</li>
    <li> Cheap in price and one of my favorite blades to shave with</li>
    <li> These are great...for the price AND quality, you can&#x27;t beat them.  I was used to the ones that came with my safety razor from Van der Hagen, and they had the ice tempered, teflon coated blades.  They are nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong.  However, I really didn&#x27;t need the extra bells and whistles from the ones from Van der Hagen, and found these Gillettes to be equal, regardless.  Now, I am set for over two years, and and sworn off the eco-unfriendly, ungreen and costly cartridges.  I will be certain to get these again should the need arise, and will recommend them to my friends, both men AND women, to check them out!</li>
    <li> Feather&#x27;s are known to be the very sharpest of blades... but when it comes to your face the sharpest might not be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a close second, but without the irritation the super sharp Feather can cause.</li>
    <li> Selection of razor blades is very personal, and I have played with 30+ brands over the years for my own use. Have ended up using these, they are sharp and smooth for my skin. They work fine for 3-4 shaves, but I find them inexpensive enough to often just throw out after single superior shave.</li>
    <li> I bought these for use in my old school Gillette double edge razor. I was used to the 7 O&#x27;Clock Blues but I didn&#x27;t see those in a 100 pack. The yellows are just as sharp and smooth. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this again.</li>
    <li> For my face, these blades are great.  Now, these blades may not be right for you.  A lot depends on your face and your technique.  I suggest purchasing a \\&quot;sampler\\&quot; pack that contains at least 10 different blades.  That&#x27;s how I found the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock Sharp Edge.  In fact, these blades were an afterthought that I fell in love with.  I had settled on the Chrystal Blades, but saw that I had a box of Sharp Edges in my sampler pack and decided to give one a try.  Well, one shave and I was hooked.  These are very sharp blades....yes all blades are sharp, but these blades are at the higher end of sharp.  Feather blades have a well deserved reputation for sharpness, and they are EXTREMELY sharp.  So sharp that no matter how softly I apply my razor (a mild shaving Gillette Super Speed nonetheless), I end up with razor burn.  The Sharp Edge&#x27;s are on the higher end of sharp, but not as sharp as Feathers.  That allows a very close shave with a mild razor on my somewhat sensitive face.  I can get at least 3 shaves per blade, and often 4 (the 4th shave is always a tad rough, but acceptable).  A reviewer referred to the Sharp Edges are a \\&quot;poor man&#x27;s Feather\\&quot;.  I disagree.  First, the Sharp Edges and Feathers are not far apart in price...they&#x27;re both at the higher end (about $25 per 100 SE&#x27;s and $30 for Feathers).  And while the Feathers scream quality, the SE&#x27;s present very well also.  The come double wrapped and wax sealed in 5 blade card board boxes.  Each side is marked with numbers so that you can keep track on the number of shave you have with each blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a box of SE&#x27;s and give it a try.</li>
    <li> After trying out a variety of blades I think these perform the best consistently for a week of shaving, between that and the bulk purchase this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> These are very sharp. For me they last longer than Feathers and Astras. feathers last me 2-3 shaves max. these last me at least 4 and they are cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. Gillette 7&#x27;s are sharp but not too aggressive and for 25 bucks I&#x27;m set for a year.</li>
    <li> I bought the 100 count pack, which gave me 500 blades or 500 weeks worth of shaving. You can&#x27;t beat the price, but more importantly, after trying several different blades including the highly touted Feather blades, I settled on this blade for me. It gave me the smoothest and best shave. Think about it, Gillette practically invented shaving. These blades are made in Russia on the original Gillette machinery. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that. Keep in mind that this is all subjective. The blade that I love, may be one you don&#x27;t care for. Find the right one for yourself. I do recommend that you give these a try, you will be missing out if you skip Gillette.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades from another site and I must say they give me great shaves.  They are very sharp but also very smooth and leave my face as smooth as silk.  I have used them in both open and closed comb razors and have not had any cuts or nicks.  However, you must use a light touch and let the razor do the work.  They started to drag a little on me after 3 shaves but still performed excellently.  I highly recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> I love these blades. Super sharp but forgiving somewhat, unlike Feathers. Last 3-4 shaves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had very good results with all the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock models-yellow, green, black, and blue-but yellow is my favorite. (7 O&#x27;Clock blues are impossible to find today.) The yellow is plenty sharp, yet very smooth. Never any tugging, and it doesn&#x27;t need a couple shaves to come into its own like many quality blades require. You&#x27;ll get plenty of shaves from a single blade, too. I routinely change out blades after the 3rd shave, but the yellow has plenty of life in it after 3 shaves. Keep in mind finding YOUR blade takes trial and error...what works for one gent may not work for another. Like I said, the entire 7 O&#x27;Clock line up is quite good. Buy a couple packs of each one, and give each a few tries. I suspect you will find your blade in the 7 O&#x27;Clock lineup...I just happen to really like the yellows. Cheers!</li>
    <li> Very nice smooth shave with this blade. Tend to only last for 3-4 shaves though.  Very sharp ... These blades do not tolerate bad technique or poor prep.</li>
    <li> great blades for a mild razor. Not so much with my more aggressive open comb. Definately a great blade.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a while before I commented on these blades.  I have been shaving with a double edge blades for 2 plus years.I am happy to say I am extremely pleased with the 7 O&#x27;clock SharpEdge.  Extremely Smooth and SHARP!  No irritation!  Love, Love, Love the blades. I shave every 2-4 days and 1 blade will last me a month.  You heard right.  I shave my head and face with the same blade. The blade seems to get even smoother after the 3rd shave.  With a new blade I have to shave my face first because of the sharpness and after that I am good to go.  Just remember, I find this particular blade to perfect for me and whoever may try this particular brand may not experience what I just wrote about.  Peace!</li>
    <li> They work pretty well once - about as sharp as a Feather Blade. The second time is like a weed whacker. I seem to get 4 shaves out of a Feather and 1 with these.</li>
    <li> Very good blade for my skin. They will sometimes last for 7 or 8 shaves before I need to change blade.</li>
    <li> purchased from Super Safety Razor . These and the green Stainless ( also from St. Petersburgh) are the best in my opinion. Both are sharp and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great blade for me. I would rate this blade right under a Feather. I would recommend to buy a sampler of blades so you can try out various blades to see what works for you.</li>
    <li> This blade is by far my favorite in the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock line. Sharp enough to slice thru the whiskers without pulling and tugging but also incredibly smooth, it&#x27;s a perfectly balanced blade.</li>
    <li> Double-edge razor blades are a very personal thing.  So the fact that I really love these blades is just one very personal data point.  But this review may help give you some context to decide whether you might love them, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the sharpness/gentleness continuum, I prefer sharp.  I am willing to risk that I may cut myself if it saves me from having to sand the whiskers off my face with multiple passes from a softer blade.  On a related note, I prefer a smooth blade--one that might cut you, but when it does, you won&#x27;t even feel it.  This means I shave slowly, with care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock SharpEdge is really, really sharp and really, really smooth.  Just rest the weight of the razor against my face, and it glides over my skin, cutting whiskers without any unpleasant pulling.  I get a week of daily shaving out of each blade (two complete passes on a relatively soft beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of these as the working man&#x27;s Feather blade.  They cost less, and they are more durable (and slightly less sharp).  Other blades I am fond of are Wilkinson (another sharp, smooth blade), the USA-made Personna \\&quot;Lab Blues,\\&quot; (a lot like the Wilkinson) the Israeli Crystals (ditto, but a bit more pull) and Derby (incredibly smooth, but not sharp enough for my shaving style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very simple--a cardboard box with five blades to a box.  Each blade is double wrapped, and the internal wrapper adheres to the blade with four dabs of adhesive(you can see the dabs on the blade, but I don&#x27;t find that they affect the shave).  There is no used blade dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades cost more than the average double-edge blade, but that is because of 1) the Gillette brand, and b) the quality of  the blade (which Gillette would like you to believe are the same thing).  But at a quarter a blade, you are still talking about something near a nickel per shave, which is way, way cheaper than cartridges, so that shouldn&#x27;t be much of a factor.  They are less convenient than Wilkinson (another favorite blade of mine, available at WMart).  If these blades are your favorite, you will want to buy them in bulk--because that is certainly cheaper than a flight to St Petersburg to buy more.They are less convenient than Wilkinson (another favorite blade of mine, available at WMart).

    <li> I have tried many, many blades and found these to be my favorites.  I buy in the 100 packs.  They are the sharpest and don&#x27;t nick me.  Each blade is in its own package in boxes of 10, the box can be used for discarded blades.</li>
    <li> Received today and in perfect condition. These blades are up there in sharpness right next to feather blades. I get about 4 day&#x27;s out of each blade and that is good seeing that I shave 2 times each day. I really like them. They have not give me any razor nick&#x27;s or burn&#x27;s so far. The price is right on also. I have over 50 years of shaving under my belt and most of that is with DE Safety Razor&#x27;s. It beat&#x27;s the heck out of all the other type&#x27;s of razor&#x27;s on the market and a lot cheaper also. Thank&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I learned about these blades on a site called Squire&#x27;s Blade review and decided to take the plunge and order 100. I&#x27;m really glad I did! They seem to be just as sharp as Feathers but not only do they cost a third less, they come in minimalist packaging (the blades are individually wrapped in paper and then packed in thin cardboard boxes of 5 each).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons I decided to go to DE shaving was to not be part of the plastic waste (not to mention ridiculous prices) of cartridge razors, and much as I love Feathers they come in un-recyclable little plastic boxes. With the 7 O&#x27;Clock SharpEdges I&#x27;m saving money and getting much better packaging. I really think these are the best deal out there for a super sharp DE blade.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades! Sharp and smooth, no irritation or tugging. A step above the Silver Blues. Definitely the best blade I have tried so far since switching to a safety razor.</li>
    <li> This is a great value.  If you are using Feather consider this alternative.  Very sharp, smooth and expect 3/4 shaves.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a gillette fat boy adjustable since the mid 1960s I have used gillette brown blades the Super blue blades and most of other brands. These have given me one of the best shaves in a long time. sharp and smooth  I get at least four or five shaves from them.</li>
    <li> The best razors blades out there</li>
    <li> Hello to all, I normally use feather DE blades but decided to switch it up every now and then.  I purchased these blades after first using them from a sampler pack.  These 7 o&#x27;clocks run a close 2nd to my beloved feathers.  The sharpness is great but one of the drawbacks, a minor one, is in the packaging.  For some reason, Gillette in St Petersburg, Russia feels it necessary to package each blade in wax paper, then again in paper.  It is not such a big deal because I am not that lazy as to where I cannot make it through two wrapper but the adhesive that is used to adhere the wax paper, leaves four big blobs of glue on the blade.  It is easily wiped off with a towel but is still a minor pain.  I have managed 3-4 uses out of each blade versus 2 from my feathers.  All in all, a great blade to add to the rotation and at a pretty good price, $25 for 100ct, cant argue with that.</li>
    <li> These are the absolute best blades ever! I think they beat Feathers hands down. I have bought a 600 blade supply of these in case relations with Russia break down and they are suddenly &amp;#34;unavailable.&amp;#34; They are hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the above is true. I think these are as sharp as a Feather blade, yet provide a much smoother shave each time. Blade life is good, I get about 4 shaves out of them. I could get more shaves out of them, but when you have 600 (with more on the way) why skimp?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is the 7 O&#x27;Clock greens are entry level, like maybe an Astra or Derby. The Blacks (super plats) are really sharp, but not smooth, and these are sharp yet smooth. I have finally found my blade after searching forever. I have stuck with these over the past six months and will probably stick with them for the rest of my life. It is very simple to get a DFS level shave with only two passes with these, although they work great with three passes for the great BBS. I pair these with the RazoRock open comb Jaws.</li>
    <li> If you really want a close shave this is the way to go! It beats any of those threw away razors any day!</li>
