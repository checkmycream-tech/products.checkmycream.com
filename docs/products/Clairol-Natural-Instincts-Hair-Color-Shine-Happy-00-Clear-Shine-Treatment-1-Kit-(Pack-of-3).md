      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>This is the best stuff for my hair.</li>
      <li>Both products are excellent for the texture and shine.  </li>
      <li>Ordering from this seller was the best thing I have ever done!</li>
      <li>and I am still very happy with it!</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s me being KIND!!</li>
      <li>To begin with, my hair was in good condition with no split ends!</li>
      <li>Makes my hair shiny and beautiful for 2-3 weeks.</li>
      <li>I have gray hair and get nothing but compliments about my beautiful hair.  </li>
      <li>Works great every time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to see I can purchase it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I searched for the shine happy product since store quit stocking it.</li>
      <li>It is a great product.  </li>
      <li>She asked what I have been doing to my hair and said it looked great.</li>
      <li>I got my order very quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>If anything, it just makes my highlights look bright again</li>
      <li>Because it makes my hair so silky and gorgeous.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is amazing</li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
      <li>I was kind of upset.</li>
      <li>Nice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the kind of hair that gets damaged very easily, and will get frizzy and/or curlier in damp weather.  </li>
      <li>Shine Happy tends to make it look more one color - light brownish blond.  </li>
      <li>It also says safe for color treated hair</li>
      <li>and I thought this would seal it and make it look even more glossy.</li>
      <li>The gray is still visible, but blends in much better.  </li>
      <li>I use it twice monthly, however most needonly one application.  </li>
      <li>I fell in love with this product years ago</li>
      <li>I really like Shine Happy.  </li>
      <li>I got many compliments at the office today.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair more manageable, shiny and gives more body.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and have been a dedicated user for years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite product out there.</li>
      <li>It also stripped my hair from its original color - lightening it, in the process!</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t give a good review of this product.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy and quick to use.  </li>
      <li>It is so easy to use</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and I always have shiny hair for weeks.  </li>
      <li>IT&#x27;s true that your hair has more shine.</li>
      <li>Just wanted to say that I have been using this product for the last 3 years to give body to my fine hair without altering my beautiful god-given highlights.  </li>
      <li>I thought this sounded like a nice product to give shine to my hair, but after use, I was horrified to find that it left many many split and frizzy ends and lightened my rich brown hair to a brassy lighter brown in any area that had ever been highlighted!</li>
      <li>Shine Happy has become difficult to find in my area, so ordering 3 boxes was incredibly helpful.</li>
      <li>This keeps my hair light</li>
      <li>I was so excited that I could buy this on Amazon since it is no longer found in stores.  </li>
      <li>My hair was so pretty and healthy before</li>
      <li>This product completely destroyed the ends of my HEALTHY hair!</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly blonde hair, very light on top and darker at the nape of my neck.  </li>
      <li>professionally colored, most recently 3 weeks ago, but it doesn&#x27;t give my hair the body that Shine Happy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them both for several years with good results.</li>
      <li>I had been using Wen deep conditioner and loved it, but i thought this product would make my hair super glossy for a length of time.</li>
      <li>It also helps my color stay fresh and true.</li>
      <li>and the representative said it will not work on hair lacking melanin and suggested I color my hair first!  </li>
      <li>and I went and washed it out right away.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started dying my hair brown after being a very light blonde for a couple of years.</li>
      <li>Love that it shines and lightens just enough!!</li>
      <li>I went and googled the product to see if anyone had left it on shorter or longer for better results.</li>
      <li>My hair not only looked better, but it felt healthier.</li>
      <li>I especially have enjoyed the shine I get.  </li>
      <li>I had to have over 2 inches if my hair cut and my style modified with layers in an attempt to eliminate as many split ends as possible.</li>
      <li>I was preparing to use it and first read the directions.  </li>
      <li>My hair looked more red after use.</li>
      <li>and I love the conditioner that I use once a week until the next Shine treatment.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I wear my hair short so it will grow out quickly.</li>
      <li>Perhaps if you have virgin hair that has never been processed or damaged or colored in any way and your hair is a blonde shade you might be ok with this, but I certainly would not recommend it at all.</li>
      <li>The next day it didn&#x27;t look as good and after the next shampooing</li>
      <li>so I gave it to the sweet 15 year old neighbor up the street.  </li>
      <li>This product should not be used on hair more than 50% grey!  </li>
      <li>She couldn&#x27;t understand that I really enjoy my almost pure white hair and just wanted a shine boost!  </li>
      <li>I regret so much using this product.</li>
      <li>I towel dried the top and looked at it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t convinced that it was worth trying until I went to visit my mom later that day.</li>
      <li>It had turned from a darker light brown to a medium to dark golden blonde.</li>
      <li>I opened the box and was honestly a little surprised how it was set up just like hair dye, for some reason I imagined it to be more like a shampoo or something.</li>
      <li>After blow drying I noticed that my hair felt like I used a new shampoo.</li>
      <li>This completely destroyed my hair!</li>
      <li>It damaged it to no end and fried it completely!</li>
      <li>It seems to me that the results only lasted until the first shampoo.</li>
      <li>This leaves me hair so glossy and soft!</li>
      <li>Am 70 years old and have naturally pretty blonde hair with some silver in it.  </li>
      <li>and this product did not layer a clear shine coat over my color the way I hoped.</li>
      <li>The Walgreens near my house used to carry it</li>
      <li>I used this after having returned to my natural color with a permanent dye months before.</li>
      <li>I use Natural Instincts \\&quot;Sahara\\&quot; about every six weeks, but this product helps keep the texture and shine longer.  </li>
      <li>It actually lets me go longer between highlighting, and my hair is very shiny.  </li>
      <li>all natural.</li>
      <li>Every time I see this box in a drugstore, my blood starts to boil because the amount of work trying to get my hair back to normal took almost a YEAR, if not LONGER - NO LIE!</li>
      <li>No mess.</li>
      <li>plan to place my second exact order next week.</li>
      <li>So my brown washes out and starts looking really dull and rather light after a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>I mixed up the clear color with the developer and put it on my hair.</li>
      <li>It did make my hair appear fuller and a little healthier looking right after.</li>
      <li>This is the only new product I have used recently, so that must be it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used this product for at least six years.  I have gray hair and get nothing but compliments about my beautiful hair.  It is so easy to use and I love the conditioner that I use once a week until the next Shine treatment.</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly blonde hair, very light on top and darker at the nape of my neck.  It&#x27;s the kind of hair that gets damaged very easily, and will get frizzy and/or curlier in damp weather.  I use Natural Instincts \\&quot;Sahara\\&quot; about every six weeks, but this product helps keep the texture and shine longer.  I guess it does lighten hair a bit, but it isn&#x27;t noticeable on mine.  Both products are excellent for the texture and shine.  I&#x27;ve used them both for several years with good results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started dying my hair brown after being a very light blonde for a couple of years. So my brown washes out and starts looking really dull and rather light after a couple of weeks. I was browsing through the hair color isle one day at WalMart and saw this. I thought that maybe this could add some life to my hair to at least make the washed out color bearable. Ugh, was I wrong!    I opened the box and was honestly a little surprised how it was set up just like hair dye, for some reason I imagined it to be more like a shampoo or something. I mixed up the clear color with the developer and put it on my hair. During the 10 minutes it had to sit I went and googled the product to see if anyone had left it on shorter or longer for better results. What actually came up was stories about how there is hydrogen peroxide in this product! At this point my 10 minutes was almost up and I went and washed it out right away.    I blow dried my hair and it was noticeably lighter. It had turned from a darker light brown to a medium to dark golden blonde. I was kind of upset. It did make my hair appear fuller and a little healthier looking right after. The next day it didn&#x27;t look as good and after the next shampooing it looked like I&#x27;d done nothing but maybe highlight my hair. In fact the next day someone at work asked me if I had highlighted it.     I wouldn&#x27;t use this product again. Although I should have read the list of ingredients it would be helpful for Clairol to include the fact that this could lighten your hair on the box somewhere and not just on the enclosed directions.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about trying this after reading mixed reviews. The packaged arrived with three boxes of the treatment. I followed the instructions leaving the treatment on for 10 minutes, rinsing, and avoid washing hair for 24 hours. When I got out of the shower my hair had a different feeling... almost rubbery. I towel dried the top and looked at it. There was no way that it added shine and at this point I&#x27;m just hoping I didn&#x27;t ruin my hair. I put my hair back in a bun and went to bed so it would still be wet in the morning and I could blow it dry and see if there were any results. After blow drying I noticed that my hair felt like I used a new shampoo. It felt lighter and did appear to be a bit shinier. I wasn&#x27;t convinced that it was worth trying until I went to visit my mom later that day. She asked what I have been doing to my hair and said it looked great. This is the only new product I have used recently, so that must be it! I will continue to use the treatment until I finish all three, but am still on the fence about reordering this one or trying something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, wavy, and uncolored.</li>
    <li> This product not only gives my colored hair shine, it also softens it.  It is very easy and quick to use.  No mess.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to say that I have been using this product for the last 3 years to give body to my fine hair without altering my beautiful god-given highlights.  It is a great product.  The only problem I have is finding it in a retail store.</li>
    <li> It seems to me that the results only lasted until the first shampoo. I did notice that my hair looked brighter initially but it was short lived.</li>
    <li> This keeps my hair light so I don&#x27;t need highlights from the spa and makes it shiny. I wish they still sold it in stores but thank God for Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have short, blonde hair and get highlights/lowlights put in every 6-8 weeks.  I shampoo and condition every morning and then blowdry with a round brush,flat iron and I add TONS of product.  By 6 weeks, my hair starts to look pretty lifeless and dull.  This product adds shine, softness and body back and gives me about 2 weeks to get into the hair salon.  The conditioner is amazing and I use it every day after my treatment to extend the results.  I wish it came as a regular conditioner to use every day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never noticed my hair being any lighter but I&#x27;m already blonde.  If anything, it just makes my highlights look bright again which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is finding this in the stores.  The Walgreens near my house used to carry it but they don&#x27;t anymore.  I&#x27;m happy to see I can purchase it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product should not be used on hair more than 50% grey!  It will lighten it as it contains hydrogen peroxide.</li>
    <li> I agree with everything VintageVixen said. I really wish I had realized that this product would lighten my hair because I am getting married in 10 days and absolutely hate the golden brown color it gave me. Plus, my hair looks just as dull five days in as it did before using this product.</li>
    <li> I have course, curly hair that has a mind of it&#x27;s own.  I am in and out of chlorinated swimming pool water daily and have been searching for something to replenish the moisture and sheer shine lsot due to the harsh conditions:  I&#x27;m from a cold climate, spend time swimming daily, and wash my hair at least two to three times a day.  This product is wonderful.  I use it twice monthly, however most needonly one application.  My hair is now managable and I&#x27;m getting complements on the radiance and shine.  I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
    <li> does what it claims, but did not last very long.  I will buy it again because it makes my hair look healthier</li>
    <li> I stopped coloring my hair 2 years ago. I have about 15% gray hair mixed with med - dark brown, red, &amp; gold...all natural. My hair has been looking dull so when I saw this in Target I decided to give it a try. Immediately following the treatment, I noticed my hair had a little more shine, but when I washed &amp; dryed it 48 hours later, my hair felt dry &amp; was very hard to style. I waited another 48 hours &amp; after washing &amp; drying, I find I am in desperate need of a trim...the ends of my hair are damaged. I followed the instructions to the letter (second), so I know the problem is with the product. Fortunately, I wear my hair short so it will grow out quickly. I&#x27;ll stick with my Argan oil from here on out!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been a dedicated user for years. This leaves me hair so glossy and soft! It also helps my color stay fresh and true. Ordering from this seller was the best thing I have ever done! Shine Happy has become difficult to find in my area, so ordering 3 boxes was incredibly helpful. I got my order very quickly and in perfect condition. plan to place my second exact order next week.</li>
    <li> There is NO shine whatsoever to my hair, it is dry Dry DRY!  Not only that but it stripped the color I had and now it looks like I need to recolor my hair.  The process is as tedious as coloring your hair...and for what?  NOTHING!  Waste of money, waste of time and even a waste of all the plastic &amp; paper it took to create this useless product.</li>
    <li> I really like Shine Happy.  My hair is brown with quite a lot of gray.  Shine Happy tends to make it look more one color - light brownish blond.  The gray is still visible, but blends in much better.  It gives it the body that permanent dye does, but roots do not show as it grows out.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t give a good review of this product.  I was preparing to use it and first read the directions.  It said &amp;#34;Not recommended for grey hair&amp;#34;.  I called the Clairol ask-line to find out why and the representative said it will not work on hair lacking melanin and suggested I color my hair first!  She couldn&#x27;t understand that I really enjoy my almost pure white hair and just wanted a shine boost!  I could not return it so I gave it to the sweet 15 year old neighbor up the street.  She said it was mediocre and really didn&#x27;t shine up her red hair like a salon or Sebastian brand glaze would.  A well, $15 lost!</li>
    <li> Yikes! Beware! I thought this sounded like a nice product to give shine to my hair, but after use, I was horrified to find that it left many many split and frizzy ends and lightened my rich brown hair to a brassy lighter brown in any area that had ever been highlighted! One of those instances where one wishes they could go back in time by a half an hour and change their course of action. I regret so much using this product. I had to have over 2 inches if my hair cut and my style modified with layers in an attempt to eliminate as many split ends as possible. To begin with, my hair was in good condition with no split ends! Who knows how long it will take to repair and grow out my hair now...6 months at very least! I had been using Wen deep conditioner and loved it, but i thought this product would make my hair super glossy for a length of time. It did nothing of the sort! just the opposite- dull and dry! I did have some areas that had been previously highlighted last summer and even though I had a darker winter brown applied, those areas were hit hardest with split ends. I also have some grey here and there and this product did not layer a clear shine coat over my color the way I hoped. It actually stripped any color that had been applied and left the grey behind as well as brassy areas and split ends. Imagine that! Nice hmm? I will never attempt to do any hair color at home again..even this \\&quot;clear\\&quot; product. Perhaps if you have virgin hair that has never been processed or damaged or colored in any way and your hair is a blonde shade you might be ok with this, but I certainly would not recommend it at all. I gave it one star as i had to give it a rating, but I would have assigned negative stars if possible. Beware! Think twice before you use this product.</li>
    <li> This product completely destroyed the ends of my HEALTHY hair! It literally made it look like my hair got burned by heat or something. It frizzed up and actually split the ends. I&#x27;m so horrified. I will probably have to go and get about 2 inches cut off! My hair was so pretty and healthy before and I thought this would seal it and make it look even more glossy. Now its dull, and damaged! Stay away from this product! It&#x27;s even worse than permanent hair dyes I&#x27;ve tried in the past, included hi-lift ones. I&#x27;m so upset!</li>
    <li> I searched for the shine happy product since store quit stocking it. Know why? Because it makes my hair so silky and gorgeous. The one added benefit is that it also lightens the hair slightly so my dirty blonde hair looks lovely and blonde without hair color products. You want to use this product. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> I was so excited that I could buy this on Amazon since it is no longer found in stores.  I have brown hair so any changing of color is not obvious.  It is easy to use and I always have shiny hair for weeks.  I fell in love with this product years ago and I am still very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I only read the reviews after I purchased and applied this product, and have to agree that, though my thick, curly hair is softer, it is definitely frizzy in the areas that I expected would be smooth and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now am looking for deep conditioners that will fix this issue....ugh.</li>
    <li> My hair didn&#x27;t turn out as shiny as I&#x27;d hoped, but this product gave it lots of body.  I got many compliments at the office today.  I get my golden-blonde locks (lots of gray without color!) professionally colored, most recently 3 weeks ago, but it doesn&#x27;t give my hair the body that Shine Happy did.  I will definitely use it again!</li>
    <li> Love that it shines and lightens just enough!! This is my favorite product out there.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews where people say their hair is dry and frizzy after using this.  Quite the contrary I find.  I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Am 70 years old and have naturally pretty blonde hair with some silver in it.  This product makes my hair more manageable, shiny and gives more body.  I especially have enjoyed the shine I get.  I will not resort to coloring my hair as long as I have this product.  Only thing is, it has been hard to find in stores lately!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this.  It actually lets me go longer between highlighting, and my hair is very shiny.  I get compliments on it all the time.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair not only looked better, but it felt healthier.</li>
    <li> This completely destroyed my hair! It damaged it to no end and fried it completely! It also stripped my hair from its original color - lightening it, in the process! This is super destructive on African-American relaxed hair, which is what I have. Every time I see this box in a drugstore, my blood starts to boil because the amount of work trying to get my hair back to normal took almost a YEAR, if not LONGER - NO LIE! THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP - and that&#x27;s me being KIND!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my hair shiny and beautiful for 2-3 weeks. Easier to style and dry.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for my hair. How I wish we could but it in the stores.</li>
    <li> I used this after having returned to my natural color with a permanent dye months before. Surprise surprise- all the dyed bits lost their color and I looked like the roots queen! Plus, no shine to speak of. I was not pleased! Why wouldn&#x27;t they warn us about that??</li>
    <li> Although it did make my hair feel softer, I did not notice any difference in shine.  It also says safe for color treated hair but I did feel as if it changed my color.  My hair looked more red after use.</li>
    <li> Works great every time.  IT&#x27;s true that your hair has more shine.</li>
