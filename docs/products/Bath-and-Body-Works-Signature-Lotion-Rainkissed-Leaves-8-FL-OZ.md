    <li> Bought this for my daughter.  She already knows she loves it and the price online was right.  Came shipped as ordered and she is very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This product smells delicious and is emollient and very easy to apply, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I noticed that it  contains PARABENS, and that&#x27;s a deal-breaker as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> This body lotion has a wonderful moisturizing ingredient with a light, gentle scent that won&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;overpower.  Has immediate softening results.</li>
    <li> Bath and Body Works lotions sell for $10.00 in the store. I like this lotion, but a person would have to be insane to pay this much for it.</li>
    <li> Crisp and clean scent--just like the sample bottles at the hotel in vacation. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Arrived on time!</li>

    <li> .Will order this again...especially for spring.  I used to buy this at  the Bath and Body Works shop and was extremely disappointed when they no longer carried it.  Happy to see it available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. The fragrance a wonderfully clean, fresh scent. I have purchased Rainkissed leaves before and would again. I leaves my skin smooth and not greasy. I love, love, love this lotion</li>
    <li> Bath and Body Works has discontinued this item, unfortunately.  I like the lotion enough to buy it on line where vendors have gotten their hands on some quantity, then they charge a higher price for it.  Everyone who walks by my office after I&#x27;ve put it on my hands loves the smell.  I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this when the hotel I was staying at had this in the rooms. I loved it. Fresh clean scent, and silky lotion that gives you enough fragrance so you don&#x27;t need perfume too.  I couldn&#x27;t find it at the store, because it is seasonal.  So glad Amazon had it!  I enjoy it every day!</li>
    <li> I use this product at night before going to bed, and no one will believe this, but something about the fragrance helps me to fall asleep quickly.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is fresh, clean and it stays with you. My hubby also love the fragrance. Love it</li>
    <li> Unacceptable substitute for original product with no forwarning that product has been altered.  I have used the original product for ten years.</li>
    <li> Smells really good! Don&#x27;t even need any cologne after using this lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, fresh. Really like rainkissed leaves. Just a little bit effects your hands. People tell me I smell good. Favorite scent of all time.</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this lotion is so fresh! I get compliments every time I wear it--I carry it with me now! Catie</li>
    <li> This particular lotion is no longer sold at Bath and Body Works locations. It is the one accent smell I enjoy most. So I always keep a couple of extra just in case it discontinues all together. My wife likes the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion thanks</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Smells good, works well. I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of some other products my wife used, so I bought this one.</li>
