      <li>It leaves my skin so soft and reduces pores to the point that I look equally as good with or without makeup!  </li>
      <li>Even with my super sensitive skin I am able to use this product and am very happy about it.  </li>
      <li>I think this leaves your skin nice and clean without residue</li>
      <li>So to be fair while it was not what I was looking for it is a nice product that I would recommend to anyone wishing a nice grainy scrub for deep cleansing.</li>

      <li>i love this facial cleanser its so great for the price</li>

      <li>The granules in this scrub are too fine for me.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a facewash to be able to do anything, especially since my $40+ acne kits weren&#x27;t successful.</li>
      <li>I have been using the MAX resurfacing products for reducing fine lines for a couple weeks &amp; decided to add the cleanser.  </li>
      <li>In the shower, at the skink, morning or night, this quickly became my favorite every day cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Clinique&#x27;s Exfoliating Scrub is a much better and your skin feels super clean and you smooth afterwards.</li>

      <li>I love this product completely and my bet is that would love it as well.</li>
      <li>Nice soft scent too.</li>
      <li>I like the product, it has a nice texture and leaves my skin soft</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m uncertain it does, but that might be true.  </li>
      <li>It is on the soft&#x27;er&#x27; side of scrubbing where I prefer more scrubbing, but the overall quality of this product is FANTASTIC!!!</li>
      <li>This stuff is not as abrasive as the others brands but has some abrasion and does foam up pretty well and rinses off easily.  </li>
      <li>and I know it is because of this great face wash and the other lotions and cleansers from this line.</li>
      <li>At first, I loved this product, and to make sure I didn&#x27;t run out, I bought 2 other tubes.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff, my skin is becoming more even my facial cleanser that I use after this is working so much .</li>
      <li>This product is not rough at all and does great on my sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best face cleaner out there. Gets rid of small blackheads on the nose area and makes big pores look smaller.</li>
    <li> I hate that this product includes plastic microbeads. Microbeads are polluting our waterways, sickening marine animals, and humans (when they eat the marine animals). Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t realize this when I made the purchase. Please see:[...]</li>
    <li> This cleanser has a sandy texture that cleans my skin very well.  It leaves my skin so soft and reduces pores to the point that I look equally as good with or without makeup!  Not bad for a woman 60+ years old!</li>
    <li> This has just a little &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; in it, so when you need a little more exfoliation than cleansing creams provide, this is a good product. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I Love this, the tiny beads are non irritating and it makes your skin smooth and soft. It only takes a tiny amount so the tube lasts longer than you would expect.</li>
    <li> I like anything from RoC; this cleanser makes my face glow without making it red and it does give an good canvas to apply your serum, moisturizer, etc.</li>
    <li> I use practically all the Roc products and love them all. I think this leaves your skin nice and clean without residue</li>
    <li> Officially a believer ! I&#x27;ve heard so much great reviews on this product that I had to try it. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and I&#x27;ve noticed such a change in my skin&#x27;s texture. Definitely will buy again</li>
    <li> Really like this product for an over tthe counter, drug store priced item.  I usually mix it with a milder department store product to give the cleaning a bit of an umph!</li>
    <li> This product contains polyethylene - aka &amp;#34;microbeads.&amp;#34; Microbeads are so small, they escape the &amp;#34;water filters&amp;#34; and are damaging our waterways and harming wildlife.. New Jersey &amp; Illinois and many countries have banned products containing microbeads because they are so terrible. Please buy products that include natural exfoliaters and avoid products that contain polyethylene - plastic microbeads.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much different with it; after awhile, I noticed my face would burn in certain spots if I wasn&#x27;t careful around my eyes.  This burning did not diminish over time.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for several weeks.  I use it daily when I shower.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Love the clean, smooth feel afterward.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser, I exfoliate every morning &amp; this really does leave my skin softer, smoother &amp; not irritated or dried out. I use this with the Deep Wrinkle Serum, &amp; Eye cream. Definitely something I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial exfoliant. This product is not rough at all and does great on my sensitive skin. I also like the fact that it foams and exfoliates, which I feel like it&#x27;s hard to find one product that does both.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product - the cream is heavy and your skin feels like there is a film on it after you rinse the product off.  Clinique&#x27;s Exfoliating Scrub is a much better and your skin feels super clean and you smooth afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love the RoC product brand, they work great for my skin.  This cleanser exfoliates, rejuvenates, and leaves skin feeling exceptionally clean, a great morning/evening skincare regimen. It is also reasonably priced, and a small amount of this cleanser can be used daily, allowing this product to last for a while before re-purchasing.  Although I have not tried ALL of RoC products, I can definitely state this product is worth the price, and the results are great.</li>
    <li> The only facial wash that works on my super oily skin</li>
    <li> great product, I have seen a difference in my complexion within 2 days.  I would definately tell my friends and family about this.</li>
    <li> ROC DID A NICE JOB WITH THIS PRODUCT. IT EXFOLIATES VERY NICELY, IMMEDIATE RESULTS, AND KIND TO YOUR SKIN., GOOD PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Roc Max Resurfacing Facial Cleanser is the first Roc product I&#x27;ve tried and after just a few uses I will be trying other Roc products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At less than $8.00, this cleanser has a nice amount of grainyness to it, to give a great amount of daily exfoliation.  The grains are smooth enough to not be irritating, but tough enough for some great skin smoothing!  The creamy base to the cleanser is hydrating, but not too much - I think those with oily skin would still be happy with it.  It&#x27;s also great for removing every trace of makeup.  I like to use this occasionally with my Clarisonic to give an even more exfoliating cleansing.  In the shower, at the skink, morning or night, this quickly became my favorite every day cleanser.  It leavea my skin soft, smooth, and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can&#x27;t wait to try some other Roc products!</li>
    <li> 4.5/5 stars --- I simply prefer a noticeable amount of micro-scrub in my facial cleanser and this is the micro-micro-scrub of cleansers. It is on the soft&#x27;er&#x27; side of scrubbing where I prefer more scrubbing, but the overall quality of this product is FANTASTIC!!! Doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling greasy, oily, stripped or anything but CLEAN!!! I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this product - it&#x27;s my go-to cleanser on a daily basis and I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Item was as described and works well. Good product. I would purchase this item again when needed in the future.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very effective for cleaning my facial skin.  It takes a bit of getting used to because it has a sandpaper like feeling at first.  My pores are definitely smaller and my skin is brighter.  I don&#x27;t know if I can credit this cleanser with all these changes, as I have incorporated other Roc products into my skin care regimen.  Roc is great.  I wish I had begun using it years ago.</li>
    <li> Love it you can see the results in a week I love roc products they work very well awesome stuff</li>
    <li> These ROC products are the Real Deal, I purchased this Resurfusing Facial wash  to use in conjuction with ROC&#x27;s Melibiose Firmimg cream. The results are Truly Noticeable. With the wash&#x27;s minor crystals, you can literally feel your pores breathe with cleanliness, it&#x27;s almost like getting a mini micro derm abrassion but this one you can do daily...My skin is so touchably soft after and it stays that way too. It&#x27;s ready for the intake of any nutients you&#x27;d want to apply or just for  the softness, tightning and glowing affect after a few minutes of washing it. This&lt;br /&gt;came in sooo quickly, I did not expect it&lt;br /&gt; for a few more days and it came with a little gift too. The company also sent a&lt;br /&gt; trial of dead sea salt mask to try Thanks</li>
    <li> Love this product!! It really works. Leaves your skin feeling clean and smoothe.</li>
    <li> Very nice cleanser.  My face  definitely feels smoother since using it.  It rinses off easily and does not leave my face dry.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO SMOOTH AFTER USING IT. LARGE TUB IS AWESOME TOO. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS.</li>
    <li> I have been using ROC products forever.  This resurfacing facial cleanser first came as a freebie with a night cream.  It is gentle enough to use every day and it makes your face feel clean and smooth.  It has little microcrystals in it that feel like you are getting a mimicrodermabrasion every time you use it.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this product. It feels good on your skin, the small granules takes the dull layer off the skin. My skin is sensitive and I have had no problem at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My skin looks and feels very smooth after I use this product.</li>
    <li> This and the rest of the RoC line are my go to facial products from now on. I have never had such clear and gorgeous looking skin and I know it is because of this great face wash and the other lotions and cleansers from this line. I use this in the morning then the facial cleansing pads at night.</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product,I recommend it for all ages.Given time you will see a big improvement in skin tone and ckarity</li>
    <li> love this cleaner! leaves face very smooth and soft. i am outside a lot so my skin takes a beating. this is the first time using this product- i&#x27;ll keep you posted !</li>
    <li> Even with my super sensitive skin I am able to use this product and am very happy about it.  Started using RoC in Jan 2014 and wished I had tried sooner.  Within 7 days I could begin to see the vertical smile lines (formerly dimples) plumping out.  Using this scrub, night cream in a jar, sensitive night cream in a tube, day cream in a tube with 30SPF  my entire skin texture is changing.  The pores on chin and nose are slowly getting smaller.  Would recommend to anyone wanting to improve facial texture.  The night cream in a jar has a little more fragrance than the other products but fragrance still not strong.  If you are in your 30&#x27; or 40&#x27;s and suffer from headaches or migraines the night cream may not be for you.</li>
    <li> Like the way my face feel so smooth and clean after using the product.  I really like a lot of the RoC products.</li>
    <li> Fast ship.  At first, I loved this product, and to make sure I didn&#x27;t run out, I bought 2 other tubes.  Eventually, I discovered that it is much too drying on the non-oily parts of my face, and I now have fine wrinkles where there once was none.  I use jojoba oil to remove eye and face makeup, and even with jojoba oil residue, this cleanser is harsh on my skin and sucked every bit of jojoba oil and facial oil out.  Since my daughter likes this product, I&#x27;ll give my unopened tubes to her.  I do not plan on purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this entire line by RoC. This is an excellent cleanser which can be used by everyone. I recommend it wholeheartedly!</li>
    <li> Works as well or better than Pernox</li>
    <li> This cleanser contains a grandular substance that makes my skin feel really clean.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any wrinkle improvement, though.</li>
    <li> Honestly, after hours of research for finding another facewash, I stumbled across this one. I never used anything by RoC before so I decided to give it a try. The price was ok and the reviews were awesome. After the first use, my face felt slightly softer, nothing miraculous though. Prior to this facewash, my face developed some dry, rough patches. The texture was uneven, and worst of all, I had terrible acne on my forehead (something that hasn&#x27;t happened for a long time). I wasn&#x27;t expecting a facewash to be able to do anything, especially since my $40+ acne kits weren&#x27;t successful. But after around 2 weeks of use, my acne began to disappear. My skin&#x27;s texture is soft and the color is more even.&lt;br /&gt;This facewash is definitely a savor for me.</li>
    <li> If you have acne prone skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this cleanser. I used this for about a week before I started breaking out. I continued using it for a couple more weeks thinking it would resolve, and it just got worse. I switched back to Neutrogena&#x27;s pink grapefruit scrub and it resolved. I love any other ROC product, so I was disappointed that this hasn&#x27;t impressed me like the rest have.</li>
    <li> I am using RoC Max Resurfacing Facial Cleaner along with my Olay Pro-X cleansing brush and I absolutely love it. This cleaner has a small amount of exfoliating power behind it, which is nice to smooth out skin and remove makeup or product buildup. Taking my makeup off can be quite a task, especially at night, so a girl needs all the help she can get. The RoC Max Resurfacing Facial Cleanser works great and is absolutely worth the money. For less than $10 in most stores you can get a deep clean that lasts all day or night long without using expensive salon products. I would recommend this cleanser to anyone, I&#x27;ve tried most products out there!</li>
    <li> This made my face feel soooo clean and soft!  I absolutely love it!  I have  large pores, some which were blocked, and this seemed to clean everything out , giving my face a smoother looking complexion.  I would suggest this to any aging woman, and especially those with large pores or acne.  I&#x27;m 44 y/o and I don&#x27;t recall my face ever feeling so soft.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Just got this and have just started using..mainly in the shower and on retiring for bed...does make face feel refreshed and clean....good product ..good price</li>
    <li> The best facial cleaner I have ever used. Roc products are the best you can buy. Try it you will love it.</li>
    <li> Nice price but just average product in my opinion.  The resurfacing granules are larger than I prefer.  I have not noticed any change in skin quality while using.</li>
    <li> I use it every day.  There are very small scrubbers in the cleanser.  It&#x27;s gentle enough for me to use every day.</li>
    <li> feels tingly with little scrubbies in the lotion-like cleanser. my skin feels so soft, and there is a noticeable difference!</li>
    <li> I like the product, it has a nice texture and leaves my skin soft but it does have a rather strong fragrance scent that I&#x27;m not particularly fond of.</li>
    <li> I replaced this with the Philosophy brand (don&#x27;t like the company Philosophy anymore, so I won&#x27;t buy their products) and I never thought I would be able to get the same smooth and clean feel to my skin.  This cleanser is even better - and cheaper!</li>
    <li> I ordered this cleanser on Amazon along with 3 other RoC products.  I love RoC and what it has been doing to my fine wrinkles and spots on my face and neck!  This cleanser has mini micro beads that gently exfoliate the skin that is sloughing off from the other RoC products that include Retin A.  It leaves my skin soft and glowing.  Will continue to place orders of this and the other Roc products for years to come.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was a bit scruffy, I suppose I ought to have paid more attention to the &amp;#34;resurfacing&amp;#34; part of the name. I like it. I alternate it with another less abrasive cleanser but I haven&#x27;t had any irritation or problems with this one. As with any exfoliant, you have to make sure you wash it off well. Sometimes I&#x27;ll put on serum after washing my face and realize I have a few bits of grit still on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If what you want is to combine a cleanser with an exfoliant, this is perfect. I already have something I use so this (for me) might be unnecessary. I think RoC  makes good products and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> This is a nice and affordable facial cleanser. I was actually looking for my Retinol cleanser and found this.  So to be fair while it was not what I was looking for it is a nice product that I would recommend to anyone wishing a nice grainy scrub for deep cleansing.</li>
    <li> I will continue to use it to see if the product will redeem itself.  My husband likes it and it seems it&#x27;s working for him.</li>
    <li> I love this product completely and my bet is that would love it as well. It makes your face smooth and younger in a week. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Great does a good job will reorder.</li>
    <li> Works great and very affordable!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this face wash!! I have been using the MAX resurfacing products for reducing fine lines for a couple weeks &amp; decided to add the cleanser.  It has exfoliants and makes my face feel so clean &amp; smooth right before I apply the wrinkle and resurfacing cream.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I only use this twice a week but I have seborrhea so it really helps to minimize that issue. I use it Olay pro-x cleansing brush and follow up with Jamaican black castor oil for moisture and skin stays smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using Roc for some time now, and love their products.  This did not disappoint.  I would recommend this product to anyone with mature skin.  Works great with the Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> The granules in this scrub are too fine for me.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to exfoliate and does not leave my face smooth like every other exfoliant I have ever used does.  Try Clinique&#x27;s Exfoliating Scrub, or the one by St. Ives, in the green tea version, sold at Target.  They are both better than this one.</li>
    <li> When washing your face ok now rinsing all that gritty stuff take time too get off your face.i did not like this at all</li>
    <li> Like all Roc products it&#x27;s great for the skin at a reasonable price.  The slight exfoliating effect gives my skin a glow and wakes me up in the morning - makes me feel alert.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, my skin is becoming more even my facial cleanser that I use after this is working so much . Great stuff</li>
    <li> I use this every night.  I like it as it exfoliates and it makes the skin soft.  It says on the bottle that using this might help make other skin care products work better.  I&#x27;m uncertain it does, but that might be true.  I am 51 and my skin is showing signs of aging, and in truth, not much I use changes that.  I didn&#x27;t expect them to, however, so I&#x27;m not really complaining.  In any event, I might recommend this cleanser for someone looking for a good exfoliating cleanser.  Not a bad product, really...</li>
    <li> Cleans great. Not too harsh!</li>
    <li> My husband said I was absolutely glowing!  I saw an immediate difference iny skin, especially great for someone who self-tans.</li>
    <li> Keep my face clean is very important, specialy after a long day at work. The Roc Max Resurfacing facial cleaner ensure that I am getting my face clean. Really like this product</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this to address 40+ year old skin and broken capillaries. Have this on subscribe on save. Can&#x27;t beat the price and convenience.</li>
    <li> i love this facial cleanser its so great for the price and it works amazing not other cleanser has help me out before, this is like a miracle in a battle i love it. i am only 22 dont get deceive because it says wrinkles... it just works</li>
    <li> I LOVE ALL  OF ROC PRODUCTS, USE THEM EVERY DAY &amp; NITE.  I AM 73 YEARS OLD, MY SKIN LOOKS LIKE I AM IN MY 50&#x27;S.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful.  I either use this, or ROC&#x27;s resurfacing discs every day.  Leaves your skin feeling like silk, and totally preps it for receiving retinol or any other treatment you put on it.  I have very sensitive skin, but have been exfoliating quite a bit for years, so this doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Price is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice but decided to try it after using lots of really expensive exfoliators. I exfoliate every day - face, neck and chest and sometimes even my hands, elbows and knees - that&#x27;s a lot of territory! You get a nice amount for $9.99. This stuff is not as abrasive as the others brands but has some abrasion and does foam up pretty well and rinses off easily.  Skin seems smoother afterwards and my makeup goes on quite nicely.  I don&#x27;t use the whole line of ROC products but after reading reviews might try them.  I will have to say after two uses the smooth factor is 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Very gentle exfoliating cleanser.  I have seen a difference in my skin, just after using the product for 10 days.</li>
    <li> just what i need for a good scrub of my face, exfoliate well and leave skin very clean.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good face wash from RoC.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month.  My skin is definitely smoother, but the dark spots have not changed.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser. It really takes the make up off and gently exfoliates my skin. Leaving it smooth. I also use the little twirly brush with this product and it really helps.</li>
    <li> This product actually does as it says. I also like Roc Pore Reducer but could not find it on Amazon. Both products do as they say and how many of us can actually say that? I was never a Roc fan until I found the pore Reducer and this one. Try them both. If you have large pores, I swear Roc Pore Reducer does in fact shrink the size to the point that you cannot see them.</li>
    <li> Cleans perfectly well without cruelty.</li>
    <li> Very, very creamy leaves my face clean, fresh and renewed.&lt;br /&gt;Better that other products that I&#x27;ve tried. Not overly &amp;#34;sandy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> lasted with me about 6 months , i used it every other day  with small amount .&lt;br /&gt;no skin irritations or complications. i didn&#x27;t see any difference form the usual facial cleanser</li>
    <li> I also ordered the ROC pads Max Resurfacing cleanser in a jar.  These are good products and so far no sensitivities have developed.</li>
    <li> Totally love this sleanser. Back in a day I purchased something similar at TJMaxx, something no-name that was foaming with particals that was cleansing and exfiliating at the same time. And finally I found a comparable replacement. It&#x27;s a creamy texture, gentle, cleanses well and my face feels baby soft. Nice soft scent too. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliating cleanser that is not too harsh or drying. I have fairly dry skin and like this cleanser a lot.  I use it together with the RoC Max Wrinkle Resurfacing System and I am very pleased.  Have only been using about a month, and only at night. I think it may be a little too harsh on my skin to use in the morning too. I see an improvement in the texture of my skin. Have already repurchased another tube and definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a good facial exfoliator.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot and use it several times a week, it cleans face well with a gentle resurfacing.</li>
</ol>
