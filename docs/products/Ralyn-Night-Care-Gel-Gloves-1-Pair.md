### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>She loved these!  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m happy with the price and quality.  </li>
      <li>These are great.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>The gloves are great.  </li>
      <li>I ordered these because a couple of years ago I ordered gels for my feet and loved them.  </li>
      <li>but I think using any good moisturizer with the gloves will give optimal results.</li>
      <li>Well, they&#x27;re made of gel and they&#x27;re kind of sticky.</li>
      <li>Would make a nice gift.</li>
      <li>These help a lot, more than any lotion, humidifiers, or drinking a ton of water.</li>
      <li>I was able to also safely wash in the washer, though I airdried them.  </li>
      <li>I wore these gloves for only three nights, and they worked wonderfully, but I stopped using them.</li>
      <li>I like these, but I don&#x27;t love them -</li>
      <li>but I am glad I bought them.</li>
      <li>Wearing them a few times a week works best.</li>
      <li>I also experienced the oft-cited challenges of putting the gloves on and taking them off, but that&#x27;s to be expected when the lining is made of gel.</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable so I am pleased with them.</li>
      <li>Overall good product and value.  </li>
      <li>They get tighter while being worn, I have not been able to wear it a whole night.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased with this product, but gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I also used gel booties that were a different brand and felt my feet were moisturized better than my hands.  </li>
      <li>They work well and quickly.</li>
      <li>These gloves did nothing for me except to make my hands HOT!</li>
      <li>These gloves fit well and the gel really does help your hands feel softer.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Because my hands are so dry, I also use my own shea butter hand recipe with the gloves</li>
      <li>I have large hands and had no issues with size.  </li>
      <li>They work great, my hands feel softer, especially during these harsh winter months.</li>
      <li>They really help to lock it</li>
      <li>Using them with lotion really helps.</li>
      <li>I am being more conscientious to wear regular rubber gloves when I&#x27;m cleaning so my hands don&#x27;t get so dried out in the first place.</li>
      <li>I usually coat my hands with my favorite lotion and then put these gloves on.</li>
      <li>leave your heels soft, but not the gloves.</li>
      <li>These gloves did soften my hands considerably, and they work as well as some other higher priced gel gloves I have tried.  </li>
      <li>My dry hands and cuticles were much improved.</li>
      <li>the fit was a little tight.....</li>

<li> These gloves did soften my hands considerably, and they work as well as some other higher priced gel gloves I have tried.  </li>
<li> My dry hands and cuticles were much improved.</li>
<li> the fit was a little tight.....</li>
<li> I live in a very dry climate and was suffering from painfully dry winter hands.</li>
<li> and my hands got a little sensitive.</li>
<li> These gloves completely stunk up my nightstand and make my hands a little stinky too.</li>
<li> They are so hot (and I am usually cold) that I really couldn&#x27;t wear them for very long and thus I couldn&#x27;t wear them long enough to be efficacious.</li>
<li> Very bulky and hard to get on even with powder.  </li>
<li> They make your hands sweaty and if you can withstand wearing them for a long period they don&#x27;t do what they claim, moisturize.</li>
<li> I had intended to use them also on long road trips.  </li>
<li> I personally don&#x27;t find them too hard to get on or off,  and they moisturize really well, especially if you wear them for a few hours or overnight three times a week.</li>
<li> I stopped wearing them on the third night when I realized my hands were itchy and bumpy, the rash was due to the gel gloves.</li>
<li> I am outside a lot and as a result I have very rough, dry hands.</li>
<li> Everyone knows that washing your hands so often, caring for a newborn, can dry out your hands.  </li>
<li> I purchased these to help with my extremely dry hands.</li>
<li> But my skin did get smoother and a problem area is not as dry, even after wearing them for only a few hours.</li>
<li> Other than my small complaint, which is not meant to be a reflection on the quality(just the way gloves can be), these gloves are worth the money.</li>
<li> that is to be expected.  </li>
<li> not as expected...</li>
<li> I have short wide fingers - the gloves do not fit my hands well.  </li>
<li> I have small hands, so they might be harder to get off and on if your hands are bigger.</li>
<li> Thry were uncomfortably tight.</li>
<li> I notice a difference after wearing them for as little as 20 mins.</li>
<li> It takes about two minutes to even get them on all the way, and it&#x27;s near impossible to take them off without turning them inside out, which exposes all the gel goodness to the outside.</li>
<li> The gloves were way too tight, and I didn&#x27;t like the knit outer fabric as it would dirty too fast.</li>
<li> I find the gloves also work well in combination with a heavy duty moisturizing lotion.  </li>
<li> The glove did not work for me, was not comfortable.  </li>
<li> I read other reviews saying the gloves were too small or hard to get on and off.  </li>
<li> The only complaint I have is they are a little difficult to put on and take off, but</li>
<li> Actually, even on my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hand, I found it difficult to keep the glove on all night.  </li>
<li> Works well but runs a bit small</li>
<li> They are hard to get on and off.</li>
<li> Getting the gloves on is a bit difficult, but I have found that to be the case with all gel gloves I have used due to the gel texture.  </li>
<li> The gel may be helpful for softening your hands, but they are certainly not good if you have any sort of skin condition.  </li>
<li> I think the heat and lack of breathability made my skin worse.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It was quite shocking how they moisturize the skin and how fast.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately,  I mislaid them.  </li>
<li> I have problem with my hands cracking during cold weather.</li>
<li> Because they are IMPOSSIBLE to get on and off.</li>
<li> I was skeptical about these gloves but my fingers are cracking and split and very painful</li>
<li> Except for looking like an idiot while my husband &amp; I were watching TV,  they were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gloves worked as promised..I used them too often though and my hands got a little sensitive. Wearing them a few times a week works best. My dry hands and cuticles were much improved.</li>
    <li> It was for someone else so I can&#x27;t say</li>
    <li> These are great. I have small hands, so they might be harder to get off and on if your hands are bigger. I personally don&#x27;t find them too hard to get on or off,  and they moisturize really well, especially if you wear them for a few hours or overnight three times a week. I live in a very dry climate and was suffering from painfully dry winter hands. These help a lot, more than any lotion, humidifiers, or drinking a ton of water.</li>
    <li> not as expected... i bought the gel socks and the socks leave your heels soft, but not the gloves.</li>
    <li> They are hard to get on and off. They make your hands sweaty and if you can withstand wearing them for a long period they don&#x27;t do what they claim, moisturize.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about these gloves but my fingers are cracking and split and very painful so I decided to give them a try. They work well and quickly. I notice a difference after wearing them for as little as 20 mins. They are not the easiest to get on and off but I am glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> I bought these gloves to soothe my excema, but had to stop using them after two nights.  I think the heat and lack of breathability made my skin worse.  The gel may be helpful for softening your hands, but they are certainly not good if you have any sort of skin condition.  Actually, even on my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hand, I found it difficult to keep the glove on all night.  I also experienced the oft-cited challenges of putting the gloves on and taking them off, but that&#x27;s to be expected when the lining is made of gel.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to help with my extremely dry hands. They are so hot (and I am usually cold) that I really couldn&#x27;t wear them for very long and thus I couldn&#x27;t wear them long enough to be efficacious.</li>
    <li> Works well but runs a bit small</li>
    <li> The gloves were way too tight, and I didn&#x27;t like the knit outer fabric as it would dirty too fast.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter-in-law after the birth of her 2nd child as well as some hand creams.  I wanted to gift her with items that were &amp;#34;just for her&amp;#34; and pamper her.  Everyone knows that washing your hands so often, caring for a newborn, can dry out your hands.  She loved these!  I would definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> Very bulky and hard to get on even with powder.  Would not buy another pair.  Need to be easier to put on.</li>
    <li> I am outside a lot and as a result I have very rough, dry hands. To the point they embarrass me. These gloves fit well and the gel really does help your hands feel softer. Because my hands are so dry, I also use my own shea butter hand recipe with the gloves but I think using any good moisturizer with the gloves will give optimal results. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune either so I&#x27;m happy with the price and quality.  When I am not wearing them I put them in an air-tight bag container as to preserve the gel.</li>
    <li> I have problem with my hands cracking during cold weather. The gloves are great.  The price was reasonable so I am pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Thry were uncomfortably tight.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister. They helped her alot.....the fit was a little tight.....I would tell anyone to give them a try</li>
    <li> I ordered these because a couple of years ago I ordered gels for my feet and loved them.  I looked several places for some like my foot ones, but could not find any until these. They work great, my hands feel softer, especially during these harsh winter months. I was able to also safely wash in the washer, though I airdried them.  The only complaint I have is they are a little difficult to put on and take off, but that is to be expected.  Other than my small complaint, which is not meant to be a reflection on the quality(just the way gloves can be), these gloves are worth the money.</li>
    <li> These gloves did nothing for me except to make my hands HOT!</li>
    <li> I like these, but I don&#x27;t love them - it&#x27;s just me, I don&#x27;t like sleeping with them on my hands but i do use them for awhile some nights &amp; then pull them off.  I am being more conscientious to wear regular rubber gloves when I&#x27;m cleaning so my hands don&#x27;t get so dried out in the first place.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this product, but gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I also used gel booties that were a different brand and felt my feet were moisturized better than my hands.  These gloves did soften my hands considerably, and they work as well as some other higher priced gel gloves I have tried.  I read other reviews saying the gloves were too small or hard to get on and off.  I have large hands and had no issues with size.  Getting the gloves on is a bit difficult, but I have found that to be the case with all gel gloves I have used due to the gel texture.  It is unavoidable.  I find the gloves also work well in combination with a heavy duty moisturizing lotion.  Overall good product and value.  Would make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> These serve their intended purpose. I usually coat my hands with my favorite lotion and then put these gloves on. They really help to lock it the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other people have commented about them being &amp;#34;impossible&amp;#34; to get on. Well, they&#x27;re made of gel and they&#x27;re kind of sticky. I don&#x27;t know how you have gel gloves without them being sort of sticky. Using them with lotion really helps. I wear a &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; in gloves; if your hands are larger, these might not work as well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These gloves lost two stars because of the smell. These gloves completely stunk up my nightstand and make my hands a little stinky too. I don&#x27;t wear them as often as I would like because of the smell.</li>
    <li> These gloves gave me a rash. I stopped wearing them on the third night when I realized my hands were itchy and bumpy, the rash was due to the gel gloves.</li>
    <li> I ordered gel gloves and gel socks.  Except for looking like an idiot while my husband &amp; I were watching TV,  they were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was quite shocking how they moisturize the skin and how fast.  I had intended to use them also on long road trips.  Unfortunately,  I mislaid them.  Great product.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> The gloves are one size fits all.  I have short wide fingers - the gloves do not fit my hands well.  The fingers are a lot longer so I haven&#x27;t even tried to wear them both at the same time - I don&#x27;t think I could pull the second one on.  They get tighter while being worn, I have not been able to wear it a whole night.  But my skin did get smoother and a problem area is not as dry, even after wearing them for only a few hours.</li>
    <li> The glove did not work for me, was not comfortable.  I had to return, I would not recommend this item for purchase</li>
    <li> I wore these gloves for only three nights, and they worked wonderfully, but I stopped using them. Why? Because they are IMPOSSIBLE to get on and off. It takes about two minutes to even get them on all the way, and it&#x27;s near impossible to take them off without turning them inside out, which exposes all the gel goodness to the outside. My hands are pretty small (ring size 4), so these must be intended for a 12-year-old&#x27;s hands.</li>
