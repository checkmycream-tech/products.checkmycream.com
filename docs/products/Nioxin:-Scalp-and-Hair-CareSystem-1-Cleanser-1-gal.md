      <li>Has a nice scent and fresh tingle on the scalp.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff as it strips all  the dirt out and leaves your hair clean.</li>
      <li>Its also a great price when compared to the smaller bottles and sets.</li>
      <li>It was originally recommended to me by a beautician over twenty years ago.</li>
      <li>The nioxin products are the best for thin hair, the hair loss is reduced and the hair is cleanner than ever, the price is amazing too, you will find this in a much higher pricer at any saloon</li>
      <li>I love this product, extremely promising.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, thick, hair and it does a great job.  </li>
      <li>This is great value since I use it everyday.  </li>
      <li>We love this product and was glad to get the gal as it is so much cheaper in the long run.</li>

      <li>Was shipped fast</li>
      <li>When it was REALLY time for another haircut, a family member was advising me what style to cut my hair, and they were surprised that they couldn&#x27;t see the bald spot any longer !</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Nioxin 1 cleanser for normal hair for years.  </li>
      <li>Why pay $40 for a small bottle in the salons when you can get this gallon jug for double that price and a whole lot more product!  </li>
      <li>I began using it (and the whole system) when my hair started thinning after a surgery and continued to use just the shampoo when my hair got back to normal.  </li>
      <li>Seems like an inexpensive add on for such a large quantity of shampoo.</li>
      <li>Get a smaller bottle at a local beauty store, try it and if you like it you can buy the gallon size online for very reasonable prices.</li>
      <li>What I did was save the original small bottle and replenish this one every time I run out.</li>
      <li>I could tell that it was much better for my hair, and not harsh or filmy like other less or more expensive shampoos.</li>

    <li> For thinning hair, this is the stuff to get.  I have used this for almost 20 years.  It&#x27;s the only shampoo I use.  Stopped hair loss, and keep my hair from being oily.  Great stuff!.</li>

    <li> The best treatment for hair re-growth that I would recommend anyone to give a try. For six years, I had a bald spot on the back of my head, the size of a dime, from a electric clipper accident at the hair salon that caused a deep wound and scarring. I used this product for about six months or so, daily (also use the Nioxin Conditioner). When it was REALLY time for another haircut, a family member was advising me what style to cut my hair, and they were surprised that they couldn&#x27;t see the bald spot any longer ! I swear by this product. Hair is also thicker. Has a nice scent and fresh tingle on the scalp. My Mother and Father also use this shampoo and separate conditioner, exclusively. Its also a great price when compared to the smaller bottles and sets.</li>
    <li> My husband had thinning somewhat lifeless hair and he seemed to be losing quite a bit every time he shampooed. I bought this and had him try it and the difference is remarkable. His hair seems to be thicker and the shine is beautiful, not to mention there no longer seems to be hair in the shower. I don&#x27;t know about anyone else but it worked wonders for his hair. I would highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I use to buy this from a local supplier and never paid attention to the price. Since I moved, I have no local store so I thought about here, wish I had done it a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I use it regularly and like it.  The price was within the range expected.  I will buy more in future.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years. I finally bought it in a gallon.</li>
    <li> I was buying the smaller bottles and thought if I could get a bigger amount, I can refill the bottles I have at home.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have used for my fine hair.  It gently cleanses as it maintains the integrity of my hair.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  Amazon you&#x27;re amazing for offering this product and more!!!</li>
    <li> Why pay $40 for a small bottle in the salons when you can get this gallon jug for double that price and a whole lot more product!  Was shipped fast and I am thrilled to save a lot of money!!</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for many years with great success.</li>
    <li> Only wish it came with a pump to dispense it. Seems like an inexpensive add on for such a large quantity of shampoo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good product and I am satisfied</li>
    <li> I love this stuff as it strips all  the dirt out and leaves your hair clean. Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The place I get my haircut wanted $60 for the 5 oz bottles of shampoo and conditioner. A gallon of the shampoo for $39.99? Hell yeah I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Great product, but bottle was damaged in shipment</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. I continue to use it and like it.&lt;br /&gt;Rod.</li>
