      <li>This scalp oil has a strong distinct scent.  </li>

      <li>And if you don&#x27;t it will dissipate quickly if you give it some time.</li>
      <li>Using it as a weekly hot oil treatment keeps my scalp and hair moisturized and comfortable.</li>
      <li>I could see this being a very good product for women of African descent, but personally (I am Native)</li>

      <li>The product arrived very quickly and in this nice dark stained glass bottle.</li>
      <li>I originally ordered 2 bottles, and am going to be ordering 3 more bottles, and unlike the other reviewer the price is not bad if you order from the Sweet Sunnah company the price is $12.95 a bottle.  </li>
      <li>At first you might be surprised by the smell of the herbs, but trust me you grow to love it.</li>
      <li>I have long fine hair that has recently gotten thicker with the use of a good organic shampoo and henna coloring.</li>
      <li>It does not de tangle the hair, so you will have to brush carefully but hair feels great and a touch of all natural de-tangler helps, but it seems to thicken your hair.</li>
      <li>i purchased it as a present for my mother, but i use it more than she does now.</li>
      <li>This stuff works you have to be consistent</li>
      <li>I use this product when I do hot oil treatments</li>
      <li>my hair a hot oil treatment.</li>

      <li>Really nice hot oil treatment, and I use it with my other ayurvedic oils.</li>
      <li>Based on the positive reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try to this oil.  </li>
      <li>makes my hair feel soft, smell is not bad</li>
      <li>She remarked its as good as, if not better than Argan oil</li>
      <li>Glad I ordered two bottles and plan to order more along with the black seed oil conditioner!!!</li>
      <li>the smell is also very strong due to</li>
      <li>I actually stopped using it even though it was working just because of the strong odor.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate the shaft of the hair readily</li>
      <li>I find that using this oil in conjunction with vegetable glycerin really moisturizes the hair AND skin.</li>
      <li>It was absolutely unacceptable.</li>
      <li>absorbing this oil in gonna continue using this every 3 days and finish the bottle</li>
      <li>It works very well for people who are experiencing hair fall.</li>
      <li>The smell of the product is heavenly and my husband enjoys smelling my hair so much when I have this oil in.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The even better quality of this stuff is that it&#x27;s not a real heavy oil and does not weigh hair down much.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased Sweet Sunnah organic black seed, carrot, rosemary oil and a different brand that wasn&#x27;t organic came in the mail.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much! Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I have noticed a difference in the manageability of my hair. It makes my hair feel very soft and luxurious. It works very well for people who are experiencing hair fall. It may be expensive, but this product really does works! Thank you for creating a product that works so well and smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty awful, it really does smell like salad dressing and I had to shampoo 3 times before I could get rid of the greasy feeling it gave my hair. I had to put product in my hair to disguise the smell for three days.</li>
    <li> I make everyone sneeze when wearing this on my hair and I smell like black pepper from the dinner table.   People sneeze around me.  Not sure how its supposed to work but it does nothing for bald areas at all.    It does however make your hair soft after about a day but there&#x27;s ways of doing this without causing people around you to have sneezing fits.</li>
    <li> Hate the smell but it feels good on my hair</li>
    <li> This oil has helped my hair grow over the past few months, and I just ordered my second bottle and a bottle for my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> It is not imagination. This stuff works you have to be consistent give it about 4 weeks or so but my hairline is growing back and I&#x27;m 64 years old female and my Mom had this so its hereditary. I will always use this to make sure my hair keeps growing in the temple area...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now and i love it. I have kinky afro textured hair and my scalp loves this stuff. i really like the herbal smell and the idea of getting so much good stuff in one bottle. my edges have grown a bit longer as well.  i apply every other day or as needed and leave it in.  if you love using butters and oils on your hair, this oil is great to add to your regimen.</li>
    <li> Awful scent. Not for me. I had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> I put it in my body and hair butter and they both love it!</li>
    <li> I love this, saw an improvement in my hair moisture in 2 days.  I use it on my feet and elbows as well, and it has reduced some of the pain, in my arm.  I love the smell, so healing.</li>
    <li> Really nice hot oil treatment, and I use it with my other ayurvedic oils.</li>
    <li> Sooo goood. i purchased it as a present for my mother, but i use it more than she does now. Completely eliminates the need for conditioner. My hair is naturally a little on the oily side, so i use only a few drops. Just massage it in after a good hair washing. At first you might be surprised by the smell of the herbs, but trust me you grow to love it. It&#x27;s a small bottle, but it definitely goes a looong way.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it does great on hair and skin. Will reorder once I&#x27;m out!! Great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I use this product when I do hot oil treatments and i will oil my scalp with it at night.  I use it every other night to moisturize my edges before applying my scarf.  I have not seen any additional or extraordinary hair growth.  I think that it is a good moisturizer and very healthy addition to my regimen.  Unsure if i will continue to repurchase,  The container is small.</li>
    <li> When I think of hair oil, I always picture something heavy; however, this oil is very light with a pleasant smell.  Most importantly, it absorbs quickly with no sticky residue.  I love it!</li>
    <li> The product arrived very quickly and in this nice dark stained glass bottle. It reminded me of one of those glass medicine bottles you see at pharmacies. Very nice. I find that using this oil in conjunction with vegetable glycerin really moisturizes the hair AND skin. My bf&#x27;s hair is so thick now and it grew out his thinning sides. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Weird smell, but it helped my mom&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> I used this and oxygenating treatment, (una) for a month my hair grew like a no other products on the market. I have dreads that have been growing for 12 years. This combination has my roots so so thick!</li>
    <li> Keeps skin moist BUT the ROSEMARY scent is WAY too overpowering! I actually stopped using it even though it was working just because of the strong odor. I tried using it on my feet at night and covering them with thick socks and the scent still permeated the socks and sheets and I couldn&#x27;t go to bed until I washed it off.</li>
    <li> Nice thick oil. Need very little when used on hair. I actually like the smell! And if you don&#x27;t it will dissipate quickly if you give it some time. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I try to make sure to use Sweet Sunnah&#x27;s Carrot Oil every winter. Without it my scalp gets very dry and my hair very frizzy. Using it as a weekly hot oil treatment keeps my scalp and hair moisturized and comfortable. It also makes your hair feel very soft. I follow the directions to shampoo first, massage a small amount in, wrap hair in a towel for 3 minutes and rinse but then follow up with a very small amount of shampoo to rinse out any excess. This is what works best for me.</li>
    <li> Wowza! I pray that they never go outta business!&lt;br /&gt;I love this better than Wild Growth&lt;br /&gt;!) I used this for a month and my hair grew two and a half inches.&lt;br /&gt;@) It makes my hair super soft( I use it on my scalp and the ends of my hair only and it moisturizes all the way through)&lt;br /&gt;#) Having an afro you get those tiny annoying knots....This product puts and end to all that!&lt;br /&gt;$) I rubbed it on the dark acne scars on my face and it helped healed my acne scars!</li>
    <li> This scalp oil has a strong distinct scent.  I like to try different scalp oils, but only use this oil once a month to change things up.</li>
    <li> I have a hair thinning issue and I use this stuff weekly. I sometimes take a dab on my finger tips and put it directly on my scalp when it gets dry which is often.  I find a lot less hair falling when I use the the black seed carrot rosemary oil, biotin and Bhringaraja.</li>
    <li> This may be the most wonderful working stuff in the world, I&#x27;ll never know. The smell is horrible and very strong. I used it for one day and was embarrassed all day long at how awful and medicine-y my hair smelled. I hoped that the smell would dissipate over time so I left it on for a second day. The next day the smell did dissipate somewhat, however, the smell had evolved into something like animal urine. It was absolutely unacceptable.</li>
    <li> This is a very honest review on this oil. This oil is really very good. It has a very strong smell and I understood that I have to be patient with the smell if I need to reap  the benefits of the oil. I really feel that this oil is pure without any fragrance due to the distinct odor. I got used to the smell. This oil contains Rosemary which is famous for the strong smell. I am trying to combat hair loss and I use this hair oil everyday. It worked out for me. Quite pricey but worth it. If you are really desperate for something that can work for your hair please go ahead and You will not be sorry. I am a customer for life.</li>
    <li> this stuff is wonderful! i have really dry, frizzy, damaged hair and just a drop of this makes my hair look healthy and shiny and smells great too! only use a tiny drop, though, it can make your hair look greasy if you use too much.</li>
    <li> I dilute it with a bit of vinegar for an occasional after shampoo rinse.  My hair is already thick, but I think it helps keep it from drying out...maybe it&#x27;s growing faster or may that&#x27;s just a placebo.  Anyway, I like it, and little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
    <li> I use this product as a leave in hair conditioner, I mix it with water in a bigger spray bottle helps keep my hair soft and my scalp from dryness. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an african-american women who purchased this oil a little over seven weeks ago. I did my research and knew that products which contained rosemary, sage, nettle or black seed help with hair growth. This oil has all of these ingredients and more in one solution. I use it 1x/wk as an overnight pre-poo scalp massage treatment(5 mins then cover hair with a plastic cap to create a sauna-like atmosphere) prior to deep condition days. If I hadn&#x27;t witnessed it myself, I wouldn&#x27;t believe it but, my hair has grown 2\\&quot; in six weeks! My hair in the back prior was mid-neck length. Now it&#x27;s a tad past shoulder length. The areas behind my ears on either side in the back are collar bone length. My new goal now is to try to get all of my hair the same length. It may take me the next year to do but at least I know this stuff works. I&#x27;m going to buy another bottle or two to last me for the next six months! This oil is fantastic and I love the woodsy herbal scent!</li>
    <li> I love this hair oil!  A little goes a long way so a little dab will do ya!  Also, it does have an effect on breaking hair, causing it to decrease and eventually stop over time.  The smell of the product is heavenly and my husband enjoys smelling my hair so much when I have this oil in.  It really makes hair soft and moisturized and decreases dry scalp.  The even better quality of this stuff is that it&#x27;s not a real heavy oil and does not weigh hair down much.  The bottle goes a long way too!</li>
    <li> This oil is truly amazing, I have hair loss and a bald area on the top of my head.  I have been using this oil for 2 weeks, there is new growth in that area already.  And my hair is getting thicker also.  I am amazed and so happy with these results, when I researched this oil at the manufacturer&#x27;s website its stated that it would accelerate hair growth.  But products don&#x27;t always live up to their hype.  This is a genuine hair growth oil.  The smell is a little strong, but I don&#x27;t mind it and it really moisturizes.  I have been using a little on the thinning areas 2 times a day.  I originally ordered 2 bottles, and am going to be ordering 3 more bottles, and unlike the other reviewer the price is not bad if you order from the Sweet Sunnah company the price is $12.95 a bottle.  And this seller is wonderful, my order was promptly processed and shipped out and securely packaged.  They are the best.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year now- every once a month or so. I have long straight hair that usually gets dry and tangled because I tie it up most of the time, and I live in dry climate. After I have been using this oil, people have been commenting how my hair looks and feels so healthy and nourished.   After I wash my hair and towel dry, I put the oil on and leave it in for about 5 to 10 minutes and then wash my hair again (the directions on the bottle suggest this way). For about a week my hair is oilier and smells like the oil. I don&#x27;t mind the oiliness or smell, because that&#x27;s what I am expecting. The smell is very strong but as it subsides, people have said that it smells like Patchouli, which I really like. Also, I appreciate that this hair oil IS oily because that is what has made my hair less dry and more shiny. Thanks for a great product. I hope you guys make a bigger bottle soon!</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel soft, smell is not bad but I mix all my oils. haven&#x27;t seen massive growth, but I&#x27;ve noticed a great decrease in breakage!</li>
    <li> After receiving my order I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this out. I applied it and instantly could tell a difference. My dry shedding hair became very soft and moisturized. I left it on overnight with a plastic bag and the next morning it was even softer. Glad I ordered two bottles and plan to order more along with the black seed oil conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> I will b buying this again</li>
    <li> My hair loves this and drinks this in. It makes my natural 4b hair so soft. It smells of herbs which I love. I don&#x27;t like to be without this oil.</li>
    <li> Love, love love the natural scent and it feels great. The bottle won&#x27;t last me long as it&#x27;s a skinny bottle and I have a lot of thick hair. The bottle is also a pretty thick plastic that is unusually hard to squeeze but that&#x27;s my only real annoyance. It doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate the shaft of the hair readily so it is not something I would use daily...maybe once a week.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be authentic</li>
    <li> First I want to say this is a great twice a week conditioner to use in your hair. I have long fine hair that has recently gotten thicker with the use of a good organic shampoo and henna coloring. It is an oil so it is greasy and you leave it in for 5 minutes or ten and then you musT shampoo again to remove it completely from the hair or it will be oily feeling. The result of the deep conditioner will give your hair shine and body. You can tell the conditioning is real not just a sleek slick weighed down feeling from a salon type conditioner. It does not de tangle the hair, so you will have to brush carefully but hair feels great and a touch of all natural de-tangler helps, but it seems to thicken your hair. It pairs well with the herbal shampoo from sweet sunnah but I use it with other organic shampoos. It would get 5 stars but it involves some effort to make sure it has shampooed out of your hair, or, you will have an oil slick. This will be awesome on hair of people of color or thick course hair as well.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong hair oil</li>
    <li> This will continue to be in my hair oil line up.  So glad that my hair responds well to this oil.  This hair oil game can be tricky, what works for some may not necessarily work for others.......Luv This Oil!</li>
    <li> Well, at least not for me, it left my hair feeling dry and frizzy, it could work for some, it just did not do it for me. I have dry/normal hair and fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am editing my review and giving the product 3 stars, after mixing it with coconut oil my hair was much better.</li>
    <li> The smell is an acquired taste but not too bad and a little definitely goes a long way which is pretty typical with hair oil. Works pretty well and is a lot cheaper than what I usually spend on this type of product.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect but I can tell you this oil does great things for the hair and body!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s the black seed I can&#x27;t deal with.  Mediciney, and hard not to transfer all over everything. Only used it once.  Supposed to be great for your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it has my hair growing healthy ,even in the area of my hair line where a spot was thinning has grown back.And the scent smells earthly and natural and not a man made scent and I like that.</li>
    <li> Love how my hair feel after. Increases volume. Hair loss seems to be controlled. Not sure about new growth yet. Wife had usually tangled/knotted hair one day, and this worked wornders! She remarked its as good as, if not better than Argan oil</li>
    <li> Truthfully, I bought this because I have scalp psoriasis and thought it might help my scalp.  I don&#x27;t see any difference to my hair, which it is supposed to help and it didn&#x27;t help my scalp so for me it was a waste of money, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the results that I wanted. However I use it to&lt;br /&gt;give my hair a hot oil treatment.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I use this in my mother&#x27;s hair as well as my own. It softens the hair. As oils go, use a cover for your pillow when you sleep to protect the fabric.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some major thinning going on in my temples and forehead, and have been using Jamaican Black Castor Oil off and on to help with the thinning areas.  While I like the castor oil, it&#x27;s so thick that it really just sits in my fine, wavy 2C hair -- it looks like a giant oil spill when I use it!  Based on the positive reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try to this oil.  So far, I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a strong rosemary scent, but it dissipates pretty quickly after applying it.  It also is a light oil; I&#x27;ve been applying it in my thin areas, and I can actually leave the house.  It doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review as I use this more, but, for now, I really like it!</li>
    <li> i do not use like instructed, my hair is like a greaseball even after rinsing out.  i saturate all dry clean hair in eve allow to sit for 20 mins then rinse, in the a.m. wash and condition my hair like normal.  My hair is so soft and frizz is tamed.  i bought this personally more to help my hair grow longer than as a deep conditioner.  I could see this being a very good product for women of African descent, but personally (I am Native) it&#x27;s too oily to leave in without washing out before going in public.  the smell is also very strong due to it&#x27;s natural oils, overall i still like and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have fewer knotted ends, and I think my hair is growing even on the ball areas.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry and this help me to comb my hair and I like how it smell and easy to store in the shower.</li>
    <li> But I think it works. I have only been using this for about three weeks. I love the way my hair feels afterwards and I think there might be a little fuzz growing around my hairline. Will have to use it for a bit loner to know for sure.</li>
    <li> The packaging was different from the one in the ad, however, the product serves exactly as it had mentioned. I used it as my  weekly hot oil treatment regime, and have seen great results after 2 weeks. Item was nicely packed with foam, in a huge box. Delivery took quite long, but within the expected time of arrival.</li>
    <li> I love this oil as my hair seems to just soak it up. Using everyday my hair is in better shape and definitely less dry. the smell is very strong but not unpleasant. I haven&#x27;t had any increase in growth or any regrowth in bald areas but I&#x27;m still hopeful. I use it daily at least twice a day since April..</li>
    <li> Not sure how much this works, just started using it will update in a few once I have some type of results.</li>
    <li> love this stuff im in my 60s and I was a redhead now theres a hint of red but grey dominates I don&#x27;t mind the grey but its dry and in certain spots not as thick as it used to be in a word blah I always used natural shampoos and conditioners but none of them gave me what this product has I just used a few drops massage it into my scalp and whats left on my hands I rub thru my hair and the feel is awesome my hair feels like velvet and my scalp has a slight tingle so I know im absorbing this oil in gonna continue using this every 3 days and finish the bottle I know the results will be amazing</li>
    <li> OMG!!! love, love love it. Not too oily feeling I only tried it after I used the shampoo and conditioner I know you can use it many different ways, however I tried it as the third step and left it in my hair. Great value for the amount you get and the benefits of this is well worth the money. Thank you.</li>
