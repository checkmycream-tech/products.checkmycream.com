    <li> I like this color so much! It is so lovely and pretty! And I love this brand. It make my hands more pretty.</li>
    <li> OPI never disappoints they always have a great selection of colors to choose from and the names are hilarious!! Good product...</li>
    <li> It is difficult to actually judge a color online.  This color was a bit bright but OPI is great polish so I will give it a try.</li>
    <li> As described fast shipping but the color was a bit different than I thought however it was just due to the computer screens setting but I still like it and I would buy from again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color - I used it at a spa for my pedi and had to find it, since it&#x27;s specialty it was to Amazon I came.  It&#x27;s adorable on my toes and gives a little summery pop of color during cold winter months and is cute during summer as well!  It&#x27;s one of my absolute favorites it&#x27;s a bright happy shade of pink/fushia.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the perfect pink, like a &#x27;classic&#x27; pink as I would call it. I found this shade and once I realized it was part of the Minnie Mouse Collection- it was a no-brainer. It&#x27;s so pretty! And the formula is great too.</li>
    <li> love this color and the opi collection period  i also bought it because it is minnie mouse. but it goes with everything</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color! Perfect for any season (my opinion). I would definitely purchase another bottle when this one is done.</li>
    <li> great brand amazing color I love it looks very pretty and was a pretty good deal I think at make up stores they are like $8 or $9 but they might not even Cary this color so this was practical way to go</li>
    <li> Love it! As with most OPI, the consistency and color of this polish is fabulous. No regrets here.Two coats and you&#x27;ve got a  color that is not childish but rather a fun and vibrant pink. Anyone and any age can pull this off. The color takes me to Cali on vacay as it just so laid back and sexy.</li>
    <li> A very nice baby pink which will makes you look like a sweet princess ! Perfect with the Nothing Mousie &#x27;bout It &lt;3 !!!</li>
    <li> I love pink, and its very hard to find the perfect pink, they are either too bright or too dull. This is just right, it is so simple and pretty.</li>
    <li> The bottle (If you Moust M15) I received was surprisingly runny in consistency. Never had this problem with OPI in years, ever. Took 2 coats to cover streaks. Sweet, muted, classy baby pink color.</li>
    <li> This is a great bubblegum pink. As usual OPI goes on smoothly and with no streaks. You could get by with two colors for opacity but I use three. You will absolutely love this color if you love pink!!</li>
    <li> It goes on great and looks wonderful even after it dries.  I get so many compliments on it against my dark skin.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good pink, and this definitely fits the bill.  It&#x27;s almost a barbie pink to me(or pepto bismol if you will.)  I uploaded a photo so you can see how it looks on me.  I like the color, I like the brand, so overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>

    <li> Just as I expected Love the color and great packaging five stars! I will recommend my friends and I plan to make more purchases</li>
    <li> Buyer beware. Can not return this item. That sends a red flag up to me. On Sephora you can return any item.</li>
    <li> Every time i go into my nail salon i always pick this polish up. The is my go to polish, and now that amazon has it i def am going to buy it. The color is pretty its not to loud, it just a gorg pink color for fingers and toes.</li>
    <li> The prettiest pink EVER! :) Love it!! Perfect for summer with tanned skin... Looks great with anything! Recomended for all dolls!</li>

    <li> This pink is very cute. When wearing all my spring color sandals with this color it really make the color pop! I get so many compliments when wearing it.</li>
    <li> As usual OPI doesnt disappoint. This is a fabulous spring/summer color. Its a deep pink/fuschia that really pops nicely on toes or hands. Excellent color and great quality. The photo pictured is extra shiney; I am guessing tons of top coat may have been applied to the picture. However, despite the overzealous pictured shine, this is really a fabulous color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect color for a girly summer effect, I love it and it truly does make me feel girly ;]</li>

    <li> love, Love, LOVE this polish!! Great price and fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> The bottle had scratches on it. This O.P.I lacquer is watery and kind of streaky. It took 3 coats to paint my nail opaque. On the bright side, the color is a perfect neon pink without it being in your face.</li>
    <li> I love this color! I had been looking for a Barbie pink nail polish and this color is a winner! I do wish it was a little bit more opaque, it took me three coats to get it truly opaque, but not a big deal.</li>
