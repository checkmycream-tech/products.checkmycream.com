      <li>I now enjoy wonderful, warm baths.</li>
      <li>Ok, if you have a great desire to have lots of bubbles in your bathtub, but cannot get them to work.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to use this one for awhile, if the calling comes for more power I&#x27;ll order another from Amazon!  </li>
      <li>but they don&#x27;t warn you to make SURE you do it!</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find another one</li>
      <li>I liked it</li>
      <li>It worked nice</li>
      <li>The abilty to adjust the direction of the jet is nice too</li>
      <li>when the suction cups  get warm.  </li>
      <li>I really liked this jet spa.</li>
      <li>I can verify that my own suction cups were yellowed out of the box.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It just circulates the tub water itself, so it&#x27;s a nice warm jet.  </li>
      <li>It does not massage but it moves the water and keeps it warm for longer.</li>
      <li>This is nice for aching muscles, tendons or bones.</li>
      <li>Got a good stream of water like jets in a tub, but not as strong.</li>
      <li>My kids love to play in the tub with their tub toys and army figures not to mention bubbles, bubbles and more bubbles!</li>
      <li>I bought this, because I like the idea of being able to sit in a nice jacuzzi tub and relaxing.</li>
      <li>However, we&#x27;ve gone ahead and replaced it with two more (one for each side of the tub), because it really is a nice alternative to a spa tub.  </li>
      <li>I had to return it and cannot find a suitable substitute.  </li>
      <li>The bubbles are nice, but overall this is not the best bathjet I have had.</li>
      <li>It moves the water around very nicely to give a relaxing feel, but it is not like jets in a hot tub.</li>
      <li>Had to return product might be ok for bubbles in a bath but not for any kind of strong pulsating water effect</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>so if I did accidentally knock it off I&#x27;ll be able to grab it.  </li>
      <li>so I will make it work safely in some fashion.</li>
      <li>My wife just love hers.</li>
      <li>There are two settings - one just for bubbles and one for a stronger air/bubble combo and they both work well to make baths a bit more relaxing.  </li>
      <li>fast ship and great product</li>
      <li>Love it being used all the time</li>
      <li>So I rigged up a support system for my units using a bar across the tub and velcro straps thru the handle at the top of each unit.</li>
      <li>Works well, would like more power</li>
      <li>better, softer or more  pliable, so they stick longer.</li>
      <li>It definitely isn&#x27;t deserving of the word \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; and the light stream of water is creates nothing even close to a spa.</li>
      <li>, I just can&#x27;t quite justify that (yet) :)</li>
      <li>However I wish that it had a stronger jet system to make the bath water move around the tub more.</li>
      <li>port (on bottom) comes with spongy filter with magic rocks inside.</li>
      <li>The best thing about this is it is quiet.</li>
      <li>I love it as well.</li>
      <li>it works ok moving water around just needs more power .</li>
      <li>A person could blow more bubbles.</li>
      <li>Yes, out of the box it looks kind of chintzy and cheap.</li>
      <li>I love my Portable Spa...</li>
      <li>Books, etc ok.</li>
      <li>what more you want</li>
      <li>The sound is nice too.</li>
      <li>I have used better but works ok</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed very relaxing baths with the turbo spa and now wish I had bought two (while the prices were lower) so that I could gift a friend with the joy of relaxation.  </li>
      <li>Although I wish it was a bit more powerful, it&#x27;s still a good value for the money.</li>
      <li>This product more than met my expectations.</li>
      <li>These type of plug in&#x27;s are generally 50 ft or more in length.  </li>
      <li>Need more of these</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>After reading reviews on this product I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying it</li>
      <li>i point the jet on my back and he feels great!  </li>
      <li>Its okay in a pinch if you don&#x27;t have a jacuzzi, but just make sure someone is close by to help if it should fall into the water.</li>
      <li>Depending on the setting - it splashes up to the top - out of the tub, versus stirring up the water.</li>
      <li>Pretty good jet system.</li>
      <li>Out of the box, its a good product, but to make it great, you need to get an adjustable hanger for flower baskets, or just bend a hanger out of flat steel to fit the side of your tub.  </li>
      <li>If people want more action I would suggest buying two, I don&#x27;t think electricity usage would be that great.....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great for relaxation. Need more of these but my tub is too small. Even though the jets aren&#x27;t that powerful, I still find it relaxing.</li>
    <li> Returned. Afraid to put it water. Afraid of execution.</li>
    <li> I actually rate this a 2 1/2. The concept is probably as good as you can do for a gadget like this. If you don&#x27;t want to replace your existing tub with a spa version, you have two choices: this, or a $1700 professional spa that sits in your tub on two rubber legs. I seriously considered the latter, but found out it puts out 1/3 hp compared to 1/4 hp for this unit (if the rating is correct), so the price difference was a no-brainer. I even took a leap of faith and bought two of these units.  Every bathroom spa I&#x27;ve used has strong, noisy jets that are placed to hit you just about everywhere, including your back. So the first drawback of these little guys is that there&#x27;s no practical way to set them up to hit your back. You&#x27;d have to sit in the middle of the tub with no back support, and that&#x27;s counterproductive. You have to be content to set them so that they pump the water toward you, letting the stream flow around your back.  The good news is that the stream is nice, not as strong as a regular spa stream and has bubbles, so I think it&#x27;s actually more comfortable. The control to set the mixture of bubbles has no perceptible effect as far as I can tell. One major advantage is that it is QUIET. The bathroom spa tubs that I have used have that nasty loud, jackhammer sound that you have to ignore (and hope your neighbors ignore as well). No problem with these guys, and the quiet contributes to relaxation. They have about a 15-minute time limit before you have to turn them off for awhile, but that compares to the recommended 20-minute time for regular spa use. Another thing I like in comparison to spa tubs is that I would dread maintaining a regular spa over the long run. I don&#x27;t see any way to conveniently service them.  One MAJOR negative to these guys is the plastic suction cups that are supposed to allow you to stick the unit to the side of the tub. These are the same clear, soft plastic cups that seem to have taken over the bathroom market. They are useless for anyheavy-duty application, and the cups on this unit are especially bad, because the edges flare up when you push on them and provide very little contact with the surface. My tub is porcelain, and I wonder if the cups would work at all with textured plastic surfaces. The manual says don&#x27;t worry, if the unit comes loose and submerges, you won&#x27;t be electrocuted, at least not immediately. Just wipe off the unit and let it dry thoroughly before the next use. I didn&#x27;t find that comforting, and I don&#x27;t understand why the maker didn&#x27;t test out these cups before clearing the unit for market. Maybe they did, and just didn&#x27;t care about the end user. So I rigged up a support system for my units using a bar across the tub and velcro straps thru the handle at the top of each unit. Not especially pleasing aesthetically, but then the suction cups, such as they are, are relatively adequate to keep the unit from swinging around. Too bad it had to come to that; the manufacturer could have used something dependable, like the suction cups that hold stuff to a car windshield.  Bottom line: if you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to install a real spa tub, this is a cheap alternative that is workable if you can deal with the faulty suction cups. I suppose that theoretically it is \\&quot;portable\\&quot; as the name suggests, but that&#x27;s only if you want to trust the suction cups or have a sensible way to solve that problem on the go.</li>
    <li> The suction cups do not stay stuck to the bathtub wall.  A piece broke off from the suction cup.</li>
    <li> This item is not to bad. I think its a little over priced for what it does. I had bought one years ago and I remember it haveing a little more jet power and more bubbles. Not perfect but takes care of what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> will not stay on tub side suction is worthless. Jets are powder puffs..if you are looking for muscle massage this is not it.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone. I purchased this for my husband. He was in a bad motorcycle accident a couple years ago and broke his femur. He has a rod going  thru his leg as well as pins in his knee and hip. While he was recovering from that he developed stomach problems and had to have his gall bladder removed. He is in constant pain in his leg and his gut. I purchased this product with intentions of just circulating the water so it stays warmer longer. To my surprise he absolutely loved it. He directs the JTS at his leg and his gut and lays there for what seems like hours and falls asleep. He says it is the first little bit of relief he has gotten from his pain in almost two years. He can relax and somehow when he gets out of the tub he doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. This is the best thing I could have ever gotten for him. All I wanted was to give him a little relief I had no idea it would help him this much and for the cost of it he wants another one so he can have jets going all the way around the tub. I can&#x27;t ever thank you enough. You have given him some relief from his pain finally.</li>
    <li> this product sure beats the hassle of a hot tub and very convience as well thank you.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002WDXGCC Portable Turbo Spa]]    This product is definitely inferior.  The product itself works but the suction cups do not hold the product in place.  It is virtually unusable.  I even purchased new suction cups thinking the existing ones were bad, they did not work either.  This product definitely needs tweeking.</li>
    <li> Stopped working.  Didn&#x27;t produce enough bubbles to have any real affect.  It also cooled the water really quickly.</li>
    <li> I do not like the spa. It will not hold onto and does not have any pressure very unhappy for 60.00 dollars not worth the money</li>
    <li> It dose not stick to the tub it keeps falling in the tube</li>
    <li> will not stay in place and this is definately not a turbo. worst money i ever spent</li>
    <li> Good item with water jet powerful enough for bathtub. Forewarned by other reviews about inadequate suction cup mounting, I used a cord to tether the handle of the Turbo Spa to the shower rod. Thus when the suction cups came loose the Spa simply dangled in the same place so that a quick push reattached the suction cups. For you sailors and cowboys, I used an adjustable, sliding, self-locking knot on the Spa end for precise height adjustment and a round turn and two half hitches on the shower rod, which is a secure hitch that is also easily undone. Spa should probably come with a hook mounting that hangs over the edge of the bathtub, but my cord suspension method worked fine in conjunction with the suction cups.</li>
    <li> Junk. Mine lasted for exactly one month of moderate use before it simply shut down.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom, it was supposed to be for mothers day but i gave it to her early and she absolutely loved it. It was a little scary because it plugs in and when your in the tub you really wouldn&#x27;t want to have something plugged in into the water. My mom was really excited when she opened the package and said it was wonderful in the tub. I recommend you buying this product.</li>
    <li> I have fibromyalgia and some other health issue which keep me from taking showers and so I am a bath person (I&#x27;ve always preferred them anyway...) The flow of bubbles even at the highest, is not invigorating it is relaxing. The motor is delightfully quiet. I set the flow to go around the tub, which keeps the water circulating around my body in a wonderfully relaxing way. This is for someone wanting a gentle flow of warmth circling their body to relax, it is definitely not for those who want powerful jets. I now enjoy wonderful, warm baths. I also purchased a full body bathmat, a pillow, and a thing that allows the water to get really deep. The combination has given this achy, often cold body, a wonderful way to relax and get warm.</li>
    <li> I really like this spa for what it is.  I have not experienced what some other reviewers have regarding problems with the suction cups.  The spa stayed stuck to my tub with no issues at all.  I actually had to pry it off when I was done.  It is very quiet and has quite a bit of power for such a small unit.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and can definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it.  At first I am a little nervous using it since the only thing that holds it in place are suction cups, but it did say in the manual that it won&#x27;t electricute you if it accidentally falls in the tub with you.  I just adjusted it next to me just in case so if I did accidentally knock it off I&#x27;ll be able to grab it.  The turbo is not as strong as I expected it would, but it does the job and it is indeed relaxing once the water started whirling, for the price this is really great.  Never like soaking in the tub before, but with this thing, it became a habit I look forward to. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The suction cups seem to hold on to the bathtub just fine despite what other reviews say. I was expecting a more powerful jet stream than what this puts out. I don&#x27;t hardly feel its worth getting it out of the box and hooking up to the tub for what little power it generates into the bath water. Doesn&#x27;t make much different from just soaking in the tub. Wished I had saved my money.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these previously, for a while, I bought last year. ON that one, in spite of the aforementioned issues which I do not argue, I still like it and used and just accepted its limitations. Last Month, we got a vacation cabin and I bought another one for that tub, I was surprised and pleased to see the manufacturer has listened to at least some of the complaints from the past year. This latest one looks nearly the same,but has noticeably more Oomph in the the water power and jet action, but still as quiet. Also the bubble on/off knob now makes a noticeable difference. Even he suction cups are a&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;bit\\&quot; better, softer or more  pliable, so they stick longer. They are still in need of further improvement,so I hope manuf. is still reading these comments, but at least now I have to adjust it only once or twice during a long hot-tub soak. Sadly, now I want this better version in my regular tub, but 3 spas for only 2 tubs?, I just can&#x27;t quite justify that (yet) :)</li>
    <li> This is not strong it gives a slight bubble to your tub</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight product that does not produce bubbles at all. It produces a light stream much like that of a river. Parts easily fall off of it. Not worth fifty bucks imo. Probably worth about ten dollars imo.</li>
    <li> A person could blow more bubbles.</li>
    <li> It was a great Birthday present. It serves the purpose since i have musculoskeletal problems and don&#x27;t have a jet  tub. It eases the spasm and pain. I wish the jet was a little stronger but it&#x27;s alright. I bought it over a year ago and itis still working. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was desperately in the market for an affordable whirlpool to use at home to help heal an injury and there appears to be only one item on the market.  After reading the reviews I was less than enthusiastic but had no other options and purchased the Home Turbo Spa. When I opened it I was still unimpressed with the packaging and poor construction of the item. However when I used it I found that the product worked as advertised, creating a powerful enough jet to massage my foot.    I have used it twice daily for a week now and found it quite helpful for the injury. The one major drawback is the cheap and ineffective suction cups used to hold the motor in place.  I have resorted to placing my foot in a plastic tub with the whirlpool so I can keep the motor in place for fear of submerging the entire device.     Considering the price it has been a value for the money.  This notwithstanding, I would not recommend it for a general, relaxing massage/spa.  I will likely relegate this to the closet once the injury resolves only to pull it out as a novelty when cleaning the closet (along with the bread machine and iced cream maker).  Use it for a specific massage to a small area.</li>
    <li> it does not do what it says. there are two nozzels and they go the same way ,you can not get them to go different directions</li>
    <li> does not work well in my tub</li>
    <li> Turbo - No!&lt;br /&gt;Powerful Jet Stream - No!&lt;br /&gt;Jet spa - No!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed in the strength of the water coming out of the nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had water guns that shoot with more velocity.</li>
    <li> I had the same product for many years before it finally stopped working.  I was thrilled to find another one and yes it works beautifully!</li>
    <li> Very useful for circulating the water as more hot water is added to the tub. The suction cups are strong but not strong enough on my non-perfect tub. If I had to purchase another device, I would choose one with a sturdy bracket that wrapped around the tub wall. Overall, I&#x27;d say this is quality product and works as advertised. In now way does this compare to an actual Jacuzzi tub, but for gentle circulation, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I had previously left a poor review on this product based on the poor performance and only a 30 day window to return it. I have since been contacted by the company and was told I&#x27;d get a refund upon return. While the product did not work I appreciate them be willing to work with their customers which makes me not afraid to try their products in the future. I would remove my previous comment based on this but I don&#x27;t see that is done.</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  It did not perform as needed.  I had to return it and cannot find a suitable substitute.  I will keep looking.  Nancy</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on this product I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying it but I&#x27;m glad I did.  It&#x27;s not as high power as a hot tub but for the price it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Since this is the only product on the market of this type I suppose we will keep it but I certainly wish there were other choices. As the other reviewer mentioned, the suction cups are a problem, actually almost a joke. Had the designers had any professional skills whatsoever they would have realised that the size of the suction cups and their closeness to each other prevents one from making a seal against the surface of the tub. They overlap each other instead. One makes a seal and the other does nothing. Since these are the only 2 seals that prevent the unit from wanting to spin they are a major design flaw in my opinion. Had they been just slightly smaller they might have been able to create a somewhat firm mounting. Ours arrived with one suction cup bent under its own packing which has further made any chance of a seal against the tub wall an impossibility. The box says that the unit meets Underwriters Labs specs. There is no holographic UL label on any of the cords nor anywhere on the unit so I seriously have my doubts as to it being UL Approved as the box states. If it really is UL Approved then they need to do some better testing. Upon plugging the unit in it immediately blew a 15 amp breaker with nothing else plugged in to the same plug. The instructions don&#x27;t emphasize that you must have the transformer and the unit plugged into each other BEFORE you plug the transformer into an oulet but they should. In fairness, they do say to do that but they don&#x27;t warn you to make SURE you do it! Like the other reviewer I will build some type of cradle to firmly hold this to the side of the tub. Unfortunately this is the only unit on the market so I will make it work safely in some fashion. It does spew out a nice stream of water so it should be reasonably relaxing to at least some degree. As most products made today (even the \\&quot;name\\&quot; brands such as Stanley), it is made in China which gives me very little faith in any longevity to its use. Even if the suction cups had been the correct size they have a limited lifespan. They are widely used in the aquarium products industry but they are also offered as replacements because the manufacturers know that they eventually dry up &amp; no longer stick. I can say at least that the company we purchased this from (Hpms Inc/The Therapy Connection) shipped it very quickly and it arrived well packed. Top notch service from them but thumbs down on the product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like it, but I actually enjoy it. Yes, out of the box it looks kind of chintzy and cheap. Yes, the silk-screened branding and markings will wear off in hot water. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t really make &#x27;bubbles&#x27;. But, it&#x27;s actually a great purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Really strong jet, moves a lot of water. I actually believe that the pump is 1/4 horsepower. You could drain a pond at a quick clip if you were using this bad boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It has a bubble knob; but it doesn&#x27;t make bubbles. I don&#x27;t know if this is a manufacturing oversight or what. For me, I didn&#x27;t really care about having bubbles as much as a strong jet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-On a completely smooth, shiny fiberglass tub, the suction cups will do a solid job. NOTE TO OTHER OWNERS: the suction cup rubber plastic is &#x27;natural&#x27; colored, it is not dirty or pre-used. If your suction cups looks yellowed or filmed out of the box, this is just a result of the manufacturing and chemical process. It has not been used in someone&#x27;s dirty old tub. I can verify that my own suction cups were yellowed out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-On a rough surface tub, suction cups are NOT. GOING. TO. WORK. FULL STOP. What should you do? Either find a way to hang the Turbo Spa by its handle from your tub spout (using 2 zip ties or similar) or epoxy some strong magnets to the body of the spa and hope for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Intake port (on bottom) comes with spongy filter with magic rocks inside. Rinse this filter out after use to get hair, soapy gunk, and other detritus out of the way of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Best thing about this Turbo Spa? It truly is QUIET. VERY QUIET. The best description I can give is that it provides a dull hum of rushing water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 baths with the Turbo Spa so far and everything is looking good. A bath with circulating water is terrific.</li>
    <li> My husband and I were looking at remodeling our bathroom to get a jetted tub, but based on cost and time, we realize that this will be a long-term dream.  Because we still wanted some sort of soothing bubbles in our tub, we were excited to find this, but didn&#x27;t have expectations that were too high.  When the Portable Turbo Spa arrived, we were thrilled to find that it is small and compact, but gives a fairly powerful stream of bubbles.  The nozzle can move to blow a jet in any direction and the motor is fairly quiet - no louder than the sound of bubbling water.  There are two settings - one just for bubbles and one for a stronger air/bubble combo and they both work well to make baths a bit more relaxing.  The machine sits on the side of the tub and while it can&#x27;t go underwater all the way, it is small enough to be unobtrusive.  The electrical cord to plug this in was also about six feet which worked for our needs, but may be a bit short for people with larger bathrooms. This is a good alternative for a regular tub that could be a bit more relaxing and we are excited that we found it.</li>
    <li> The turbospa literally does nothing. It definitely isn&#x27;t deserving of the word \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; and the light stream of water is creates nothing even close to a spa. Save your money.</li>
    <li> The jets do not spray very strong, and there is no difference in changing it from low to high.  The on/off button sticks as well.  The bubbles are nice, but overall this is not the best bathjet I have had.</li>
    <li> i have a bad back and cant afford a 800 dollar jacuzzi.  this has one jet with two types of bubbles.  i point the jet on my back and he feels great!  i plan to oder another for my feet!</li>
    <li> I was going for daily whirlpool treatments for an open wound but naturally medicare only pays for a certain number of treatments, so I thought I would give this product a try, well let me tell you it is working out just fine, the wound is closing up nicely, but surgery might still be needed, but I am completely satisfied with the results from this product, way surpassed my expectations, and the price was very reasonable.  But like I read before my purchase the suction cups do leave a lot to be desired, but I can live with that.</li>
    <li> It is fairly easy to use.  However I wish that it had a stronger jet system to make the bath water move around the tub more.</li>
    <li> Finding the right spot in the tub to get this connected where it circled the water how I wanted was a little challenging, but once I got it, I did enjoy it. I also purchased the overflow cover to allow the room for the extra water.  Only piece a little disappointing is I wish it were a bit longer - so the jets were down just a little further in the water.  Depending on the setting - it splashes up to the top - out of the tub, versus stirring up the water.</li>
    <li> My wife just love hers. Over the years we have bought 5 of these. The one bad thing about this product is that the cord gets tangled and knotted and you have to take time to straighten out (which does take some time to do).</li>
    <li> The best thing ever. If you want a spa feeling but have a small tub this is the answer. Sticks to side of tub. Does not take up too much room. Pretty good jet system. Jet are only single directional but you can move the jet from side to side to give you a message in various places. Great price. Couldn&#x27;t find this item anywhere elase. Bought another to have as a spare just because I like it so much</li>
    <li> I liked it but I find the suction cups to be cheaply made, especially the small pieces that are there to keep them in place. They come off and fall into the body of the machine and are extremely difficult to retrieve! I especially like the oxygen bunnies with the stream and the machine is very quiet and easy to install and operate.</li>
    <li> I will not buy again. Extremely likeliness of electrocution is my belief. Will not recommend to others. Poor engineering. Great concept though.</li>
    <li> Do Not waste your money.  Provides no circulation.  Very little power from jets.  adaptor that directs water does not stay put.  Product does not create bubbles as stated in ad and on box  This product is a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> About what I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> the product doesnt meet my expectations. poor flow of water not very relaxing whats it says on package doesnt do</li>
    <li> Works well, would like more power</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because this thing was a piece of junk. My wife used it for about  5 minutes, and it stopped working. I guess it couldn&#x27;t stand being in the tub!!. Also one of the sucker cups was malformed and wouldn&#x27;t stick. Oh well, I&#x27;ll never buy anything like this again  from Amazon. Books, etc ok. Electrinics, no way.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it,Does as it is advertised.</li>
    <li> Not a bad device. Bought it for my girlfriend and no complaints so far. It&#x27;s not a spa but for the price, does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> Not even as strong as a running faucet.</li>
    <li> Had to return product might be ok for bubbles in a bath but not for any kind of strong pulsating water effect</li>
    <li> Helps your sore muscles especially my back problems I have .. I would defiantly recommend this to my friends and family :D</li>
    <li> Reading these reviews, I have to wonder if the manufacturer made improvements to the suction cups over the years. I&#x27;ve had no problem. As otherwise promised, it is quiet, powerful, and really does turn my tub into a spa. The power cord is plenty long enough. One thing they don&#x27;t warn you about is the &amp;#34;fill level&amp;#34; -- it doesn&#x27;t account for the increase in volume when you get into the tub! So keep that in mind. But overall, I recommend this product. As another reviewer said, you can either buy a $2000 home spa, or you can buy this handy little gadget. It gets the job done almost as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in late September but didn&#x27;t rate it right away.  It seemed a bit cheaply made so I suspected it wouldn&#x27;t hold up.  I planned to review it after Christmas as that would be about 3 months.  Well,it was used on average twice a week and quit working on 12/29/12.  I tried everything to get it going.  The unit was getting power, it just would not turn on.  It wasn&#x27;t clogged up or anything as I cleaned it regularly.  So, I can&#x27;t find a reason for it to quit other than it just didn&#x27;t make par.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably replace with a differnet brand.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected, but does a pretty good job. And the price was good. My tub is small which might be part of the problem, unit close to my leg</li>
    <li> I used my portable Spa a couple of days ago (with my husband standing right by in case it fell into the water).According to the directions, in case it fell into the water, you should quickly unplug it...  It worked nice but I believe it could pose a possible hazard if nobody was standing by to unplug it.  We don&#x27;t have an electrical outlet close enough to unplug it in case the suction cups should cause it to not hold firmly to the tub... Its okay in a pinch if you don&#x27;t have a jacuzzi, but just make sure someone is close by to help if it should fall into the water.</li>
    <li> great product on time</li>
    <li> This item works well and attaches with ease.  The jet works well, but does&#x27;t go deep enough to be very effective.</li>
    <li> It moves the water &amp; makes a nice bubble bath, but I wanted it for easing a painful hip. I&#x27;ll probably stick it away somewhere &amp; never use it again.</li>
    <li> THE SUCTION CUPS OVERLAP SO IT WONT STICK TO BATHTUB AND OF COURSE U CANT RETURN IT IF U USE IT!  DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice.  The top knob that adjusts the type of jet you have is hard to turn when your hands are wet.  They should have put a different type of knob On there.  Otherwise very nice.  Plenty of power.</li>
    <li> Definetly not what I thought it was,has very little power to even stream water out. Only 1 jet works not worth the money</li>
    <li> This item was not as described. The jet power is minimal and the mounting to the tub and to be reconfigured just to sit on the edge. Not worth a dime</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he didn&#x27;t feel that the jet action was strong enough. I ended up donating it to Good Will since I do showers and not baths and he passed away in the meantime.</li>
    <li> This is nice for aching muscles, tendons or bones. The power is sufficient but I would like a little more. I have and will continue to use it. We can&#x27;t expect the same that an actual hot tub can provide!</li>
    <li> I was impressed with this item. Although I wish it was a bit more powerful, it&#x27;s still a good value for the money. Haven&#x27;t had the suction cup problem that others referenced, so maybe they&#x27;ve fixed that problem.</li>
    <li> My first and last time ordering on-line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device has obviously been packed away, as the body of unit has slight yellowish tent to it. Also the device does not shut down, due to the power button, you have to unplug from the wall to shut it down. Only used once.</li>
    <li> This product more than met my expectations. The jets deliver a steady, powerful steam, the settings allow for both bubbling &amp; pulsating, &amp; the attached suction cups secure the spa to the tub until you&#x27;re ready to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;It has an especially long cord for convenient placement, it is easily cleaned &amp; maintained, &amp; it purrs quietly during operation.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> Not practical for the price , disappointed . The slant shape on a normal tub doesn&#x27;t work for this and if you use it on the side it doesn&#x27;t reach your back etc.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money. It does not massage but it moves the water and keeps it warm for longer. The sound is nice too. It sounds like a whirlpool, which is quite relaxing</li>
    <li> Will do in a pinch, Not really strong enough and can&#x27;t hit your back. Hard to position in tub so that it is effective and out of the way.</li>
    <li> Love it being used all the time</li>
    <li> Product came in original box, torn and tattered, no outer box for shipping. That being said, it worked fine. Ran hot bath, soaked suction cups in hot water to soften before attaching. Had to pry them off twice, still going strong. But since all the reviews I could not totally relax, so now I take the shower tieback and tie it to the handle to the towel rack just in case. When I first used it, I had it next to me and rested my leg on it until I was sure it would stay put. Got a good stream of water like jets in a tub, but not as strong. Next time I put it at the end of the tub and I really like it there. All in all, thumbs up for me.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be better. Very fast transaction</li>
    <li> the machine is not working at all / i will not bother my self to pay any further money shippment to bring it back</li>
    <li> The turbo spa had more power than expected.  Meets my needs and it is portable, easy to store. Higly recommend.</li>
    <li> This unit has a very short electrical cord requiring a three prong grounded extension cord to plug in.  These type of plug in&#x27;s are generally 50 ft or more in length.  It also added not to use if have circulation problems in the legs.  Well, DUH, this is what a jetted tub or spa is for is to increase circulation.  I have it packaged up to return after Christmas.  Too busy to do so now.</li>
    <li> The Spa came in time, but it didnt work on my portable foot tub.</li>
    <li> This is a gadget, not a functional piece of equipment</li>
    <li> Very nice,though would like a cleanable filter on the bottom.</li>
    <li> I have had the turbo spa a week and have used it a few times.  I was very nervous after reading the reviews that I would have to spend most of my bath time making sure it didn&#x27;t fall into the water.  I was pleased to find that the suction cup held very well. In fact, like another reviewer said I had to sort of pry it off the tub to reposition it.  It is no jacuzzi, but it isn&#x27;t supposed to be.  I have enjoyed very relaxing baths with the turbo spa and now wish I had bought two (while the prices were lower) so that I could gift a friend with the joy of relaxation.  I would definitely reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> Suction broke after 1 use and the jets are a joke. It&#x27;s not even powerful enough to feel the jets in our small bath tub and is a total waste of money in my opinion. It was an xmas gift for the wife and it was actually laughed at after one use. I really wish I could return it for my money.</li>
    <li> it was all it was supposed to be for the person it was gifted to!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 1 month and have used the item only 3 times.  One of the suction discs doesn&#x27;t work (never did actually) and a week ago one of the air jets stopped working.</li>
    <li> Just like a jacuzzi!!!</li>
    <li> This was not at all what I expected. It did not have enough power to help what I needed it for. Also, the suction cups kept sliding down making the spa go down farther into the water. I should have been refunded my price for having to return it to you.&lt;br /&gt;Have a blessed day,&lt;br /&gt;Dot Reece</li>
    <li> Awesome....I love my Portable Spa... It is so easy to set  up. Has helped my  back and have less pain.</li>
    <li> I bought this, because I like the idea of being able to sit in a nice jacuzzi tub and relaxing. This is great, it was perfect. It allowed me to have the jacuzzi and relaxing, and when my body aches, it does help to get the kinks out.</li>
    <li> Ez setup and and ready to use. Makes your bath a spa in mins. Jets keep water  moving  and  same  temp.</li>
    <li> perfect condition&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
    <li> It Just Did Not Work As Good As I Wanted It To I Want My Money Back</li>
    <li> I use this on bubbles.  I was diagnosed with severe arthritis in my hip.  This is a great home therapy when I cannot get to the therapy pool.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect spa action like the big tub units, this is what it is, a inexpensive little unit that feels good. If people want more action I would suggest buying two, I don&#x27;t think electricity usage would be that great.....unless one is planing on living in the tub?  I&#x27;m going to use this one for awhile, if the calling comes for more power I&#x27;ll order another from Amazon!  I pulled on the thing, it stuck fine, maybe if one is having a suction cup problem, maybe clean the spot you want to put it.....might help?</li>
    <li> I particularly did not like this product - I found it to be very disappointing - it did not stick to the tub surface and I found a very hard use of it.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical after reading reviews and planned to tie this to my faucet to keep from slipping in my tub, but it has stuck to the tub perfectly so I didn&#x27;t need to rig it. I use it on the side of my tub down by my feet. I either shoot it straight down the side of the tub towards my back which gently shoots the water around my back and around the tub. Or I shoot it towards my feet. I compare it to an above ground pool&#x27;s filter. It keeps the water flowing nicely which feels great and is both calming and relaxing. If you want a massage from it, just get close to it with your feet or your back like you would if you are in a pool next to the filter shooting out water. I love it and have used it almost everyday since I&#x27;ve received it. It is so easy to put in or store to dry out, plus extremely quiet.</li>
    <li> My order came really quick via FedEX. Although the pressure isn&#x27;t what I thought it to be. Like the size of it as not bulky and in the way but doesn&#x27;t create bubbles very well either.</li>
    <li> NEW OR USED... Just received this item and it was obvious that it had been used before.. Beware.. Sending it back!! It came in the plastic wrap and everything.. But take a good look at the suction cups.. if they are yellow and dirty looking it is either used or has been in a flood or something that I&#x27;m not going to put in my bath water.. I NEVER complain or write negative comments, but this is ridiculous..</li>
    <li> I really liked this jet spa. The only thing that disappointed me is that it did not last very long before the motor went out</li>
    <li> It is the worst one yet. I have had several types for my tubs. This one  you can get a few ripples in the water but that is about it. I bought this type because the Conair mat I have won&#x27;t stick to my tub. This one got used once and is now sitting in my garage. very sad &amp; disappointing . not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I received my portable spa and it only operates on one setting no matter where the dial is turned.  The suction cups have adhered well enough for me so no problem there.  If only it worked as advertised.  Also, the noise is similar to having a fan turned on in the room.  I&#x27;m used to soaking in quiet, so it is louder than I&#x27;d wish but according to other reviews, is quieter than others.  Apparently I can return the item if I pay the return shipping - no exchange option exists - but that doesn&#x27;t seem right for an item that is defective ... so beware that aspect.</li>
    <li> The spa performs great.  I did not give it a 5th star because it slides down when the suction cups  get warm.  I rigged up a brace to prevent this and all is fine.  I recimmenc the product.  It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  Help me to relax.</li>
    <li> Ok, if you have a great desire to have lots of bubbles in your bathtub, but cannot get them to work.  No worries, it is not your water or the soap you are using!  You gotta try this Turbo Spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves bubbles but we could not make any bubbles in our tub.  We first thougtht it was our water, then maybe the bubble solution or soap... Nothing we tried create any bubbles to her satisfaction.  Then I found this, and you can litterally make tons of bubbles with any water and soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your significant other will love you for it.</li>
    <li> Update: One of the two spa units I bought stopped working after less than a year. So they don&#x27;t seem to hold up over time.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I had expected a jet. It does move the water around, but I was disappointed. On the plus side, when I contacted the seller to ask about returning the product I was contacted within 24 hours and the rep was wonderful. They do stand behind their products and while I was not pleased with this particular item, I would not hesitate at all to order from them again. They do put the customer first.</li>
    <li> works great gentle massage and very quite</li>
    <li> Not much jet stream and keeps detaching from the tub.</li>
    <li> fast ship and great product</li>
    <li> I would have liked a little more power. Otherwise everything is as described.  I may just buy another one soon.</li>
    <li> bought this product to turn my bath into a jet tub - it does the job.  Haven&#x27;t had an issues or complaints with it.  Works well, especially for the price.  Would buy this item again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife in a last ditch effort to avoid installing a Spa Tub.  While it does not put out the power of an expensive spa jet, it&#x27;s pretty close, and certainly a surprisingly strong stream for the size and price. Plus, we&#x27;ve been unhappy with previous spa jet products, as the shoot outside air through the water (making it a cold jet) - this does NOT do that.  It just circulates the tub water itself, so it&#x27;s a nice warm jet.  The abilty to adjust the direction of the jet is nice too (about 45 degrees to the right or left of center), giving you some flexibility on where you want to mount the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction cups: Our tub is smooth porcelain on the side.  It had no problems staying in place.  However, with the jet on full power and pointed all the way to the left or right, it does cause the bottom of the unit (where the jet is) to slowly turn the unit in a circular motion.  They are not cheap or undersized suction cups, but with the motor towards the top of the unit (making it top-heavy), and a strong jet at the bottom, the design isn&#x27;t perfect.  Sliding the unit to another position on the tub so the jet didn&#x27;t have to be pointing all the way left/right worked fine and the unit doesn&#x27;t budge.  But, if where you want to place the unit is limited, this can be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assume turning the power down might also work, but the variable knob was defective, as the jet was always on full. So I have returned this unit, promptly got a refund.  However, we&#x27;ve gone ahead and replaced it with two more (one for each side of the tub), because it really is a nice alternative to a spa tub.  Honestly, it really didn&#x27;t matter that much that the jet wasn&#x27;t adjustable, but why keep a unit with a broken knob if you don&#x27;t have to.  Had to knock off a star for dealing with a defective product and the limitation on the jet position, otherwise highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth noting that with the unit running and circultaing the water, she says she only has to use about 1/10th of bubblebath she would normally use without it. I&#x27;ve seen some reviews where people expected the unit to make bubbles - it doesn&#x27;t as far as I could tell, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to - that would be shooting cold outside air into the tub water.</li>
    <li> like it but does not stick to side of tub! and would not even stick to any other surface. and just like someone had said the cups looked like they had been used.one should not have to use rope to use this product. p.s think about it before you get this. other then that works great.</li>
    <li> Was not what expected. I ordered this for a friend and they returned it. We were looking for something to replace a Daisy spa that does not seem to be made anymore.</li>
    <li> Out of the box, its a good product, but to make it great, you need to get an adjustable hanger for flower baskets, or just bend a hanger out of flat steel to fit the side of your tub.  This will keep it from falling.  Plus, the diverter attachment points both jets straight so if you want each jets going to different directions, you&#x27;ll have to glue them to keep them from pointing straight.  If you glue them, you can still move the direction on the main unit.  If you want 2 powerful jets, get this one...but if you want powerful bubbles, get the homemedics bath spa.  I have both.</li>
    <li> One pitiful still jet.</li>
    <li> Suction cups don&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Got this as a birthday gift and wife loves it. She uses it every chance she gets. I love it as well.</li>
    <li> Well for the money I guess it is all right. I have to tape the suction cups on to the tub since they don&#x27;t stay on very well. I would have purchased the more expensive model if I could have but I got this one instead since I could afford it. So the bottom line is you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> This spa does not serve any functional purpose other than to annoy the user.  Its jets can be directed, but very little pressure is put out on either bubbles or jet (no big difference between the two) and it repeatedly let loose and fell off the tub and onto the floor.  I was so disappointed.  I was really hoping to be able to ease the pain and aching from my fibromyalgia with this unit, but it&#x27;s a no go and a no advice to others to buy from this product line.</li>
    <li> My husband surprised me with this as a gift. I love it. Works great. The pressure is just like a normal jet tub, but not over bearing. Perfect for a relaxing bath.</li>
    <li> Retaining clip on bottom suction cup missing, and none of the suction cups hold at all, also metal bearings came out of the unit after turning it on, making grinding noise. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I enjoy my turbo spa, now all I need is a spa pillow.</li>
    <li> I purchased the spa for my mother. She enjoyes it very much. The only thing she said negative about it is: it smells like something burning in the cord by the oblong box on the cord. Couldn&#x27;t find an address to write or a phone number to call to see if this in normal.</li>
    <li> I like this portable spa as it makes mild ripples that I find soothing..this model does not create a rigorous jet stream..is perfect for me and soothes aching muscles..</li>
    <li> This product is worth purchasing. I care for a handicapped person and he loves easing his aches with this product. I can&#x27;t seem to get him away from the bathtub anymore</li>
    <li> I received a repackaged product. It did not come in its original package or have any directions. The suctions cups will not hold it onto the tub, but  I managed to figure out a way to get it to hold. All said and done, my 89 year old mother really enjoys it during her bath and that is all that matters.</li>
    <li> As in the other reviews the suction cups don&#x27;t hold the unit.  There are probably very few tubs that would work with them.  I anticipated this and made a insulated wire loop that hung it from the faucet.  I made the length so the unit was proper depth in the water.  We wanted it to use with bubble bath and it did a very good job.  If you are looking for streams of water all over the tub the unit is not big enough to do that.  The low voltage power wire was long enough so it reached an outlet above the sink.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a neat &amp; wonderful portable turbo spa. No problems on stinking on the tub. Makes a wonderful gift for anyone</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I was looking for, a few bubbles and moving water. No more, no less. It&#x27;s not a Jacuzzi jet tub so I wasn&#x27;t expecting minor miracles.</li>
    <li> The item I  receive was not complete And I did not like my response When I call to ask if I could get the peace that was missing they told me I had to return the item not too much help</li>
    <li> The stream is  very weak. I expected more.</li>
    <li> This gadget sounds good but lacks power. the jets are anemic for a 1/4 hp motor. The best thing about this is it is quiet. I use it for a foot bath as the other units are noisy.</li>
    <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like it but my 4 year old did. Pretty expensive for a bath toy.  Need to find one with a heater too.</li>
    <li> it works ok moving water around just needs more power . i would not buy again . what more you want</li>
    <li> I had hoped for a more powerful jet, but it is small so I shouldn&#x27;t have expected quite so much. I like it though and find it does help especially when I can get the sore parts of my legs and ankles directly in front of the jet.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.  First, as mentioned in other reviews, the design allows only 2 of the 3 suction pads to stick to the tub.  This means the turbo spa tends to sink in the water (scary with electrical devices) and tilts as it operates.  Second, after a couple of months of frustrating use the on/off switch stopped functioning.  Cheap, poorly designed junk product.</li>
    <li> I have a slope on my bathtub, which makes this product unusable.  In order to position the jet at the proper level it shoots out of the water.  I need to put it in the water below the safe operating level for it to shoot under water, which I don&#x27;t feel comfortable doing.  Also the bubbler didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have used better but works ok</li>
    <li> I walked the Rodes City Run today, 10K. Afterwards, just some Epsom Salt in the bath tub and turn it on. Helps a lot.</li>
    <li> The packaging was in tatters, the plastic covers over the items was opened and torn, the electric cord had been opened and used. For a product that is to be used in a bath, this is very unsatisfactory, particularly as it was advertized as NEW.</li>
    <li> My family and I like the turbo spa. My kids love to play in the tub with their tub toys and army figures not to mention bubbles, bubbles and more bubbles! ;-) Relaxing to us older ones.</li>
    <li> Good luck getting it to stick to the side of the tub.  I have not been able to even use it because it comes off and sinks to the bottom.  Alot of money for something unusable.</li>
    <li> I do like it. It moves the water around very nicely to give a relaxing feel, but it is not like jets in a hot tub.</li>
    <li> It did not have enough blow to push the water.  Threw it away.</li>
    <li> The on and off switch did not work. Had to turn it off by pulling the plug. When you are in water thats dangerous.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s supposed to stick to the side of the tub, it slips a lot! It does make a lot of bubbles though!</li>
    <li> The suction on the side did&#x27;nt hold so there was a safety hazard if the spa fell completely in the water, &amp; it was&#x27;nt as powerful as indicated.</li>
    <li> The suction cups were not strong enough to hold it in place in the tub</li>
    <li> It does not have much power</li>
    <li> Constantly falls off the tub sides. Jets too weak to give much massage relief. Cannot aim jets where needed the most at back.</li>
    <li> It did not work with my standard height bath tub. The suction cups are mounted high and the water level line is low. Could not fill the tub over four inches deep.</li>
    <li> I like my turbo spa, the only thing is it can not go on the side of a reg tub. So I have to put it at the end of the tub</li>
    <li> I never had the chance to use it because it was very dirty and looked like it was used.  SportingDoc would not give me a replacement for the same price.  I am very disappoint with that company and will NEVER do business with them. When I had spoken with the customer service person and asked about a replacement he told me he would asked. A supervisor.  Long story short they would not and blamed amazon for sending it. I was looking forward in using the Portal Turbo Spa.  Now  the spa is  $60.00,before $49.  When I had brought this product, it stated it was new and from SportingDoc.</li>
    <li> Weak. Insufficient flow of water on either setting. Poor performance. Rerquires  very deep tub. Cannot recommend under any circumstance. Pass..</li>
