      <li>It is easy to use and easy to clean so that is really good.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m torn on whether it would be good for first time epilator</li>
      <li>I used it in the shower the first time, and I admit I didn&#x27;t really do a good job.  </li>
      <li>Conair E4 Satiny Smooth Total Body Epilator is AWESOME!!</li>
      <li>It is very easy to clean with the removable heads and the brush for cleaning.  </li>
      <li>really do think this is a good product ...</li>
      <li>(This is my first, so I was happy to read the warning because it DID irritate my skin the first time.</li>
      <li>circular shape makes the epilator easy to hold.</li>
      <li>was easily bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is rechargeable and the top easily pops off making it easy to clean by just blowing on it over the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It cleans easily and comes will all the supplies you&#x27;ll need, including a storage pouch.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And it does a great job there--as I&#x27;m sure it would everywhere else if I could only stand the pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>does a very good job, much better than other epilators I have</li>
      <li>My wife used the shaving head on the fine hair on the back of my neck and it worked great to give me that neat look we both like.  </li>
      <li>My underarms and legs are so smooth without worries about niks.</li>
      <li>It is thorough and the place stays smooth for some time.</li>
      <li>I recommend this Conair epilator to everyone that likes to achieve that smooth epilator finish.</li>
      <li>It leaves a smooth feeling to the shaven area.  </li>
      <li>together it does fit</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s over all a good epilator apart from my observation on particularly sensitive parts.</li>
      <li>The full sized head worked very nicely to remove the leg hair and keep it gone from her legs for several weeks!  </li>
      <li>So, as long as you are ok with it being battery powered ONLY and your battery doesn&#x27;t require changing - it works and is great!</li>
      <li>I love the shape, it is so much easier to use then</li>
      <li>the \\&quot;stick\\&quot; shape my older epilator had, and I love the light, it really makes it easy to see.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m bold there</li>
      <li>product arrived quickly as always with Amazon prime.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to trying an epilator and it ended up not being my cup of tea, but the product works as advertised and the trimmer attachment is pretty nice.</li>
      <li>is very pretty</li>
      <li>The light is pretty helpful when squinting to see if I&#x27;ve missed any hairs.  </li>
      <li>But, after 3 or 4 full cycles - it holds a charge just fine and really does act as an epilator and as a shaver.</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t read the charging instructions and did not realize it takes 3 full charges and discharges before the battery is at full capacity.  </li>
      <li>pain was a significant factor at first.  </li>
      <li>If you are someone used to this kind of product, this appears to be a solid choice to buy.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think the end result is worth the pain.</li>
      <li>I do appreciate the light which makes it easy to see if you&#x27;ve left any stray hairs.</li>
      <li>The directions, if you have never used an epilator before, are not too clear on how to attach the blade heads, but it is easy to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ve probably already guessed that you&#x27;d better have no plans to make the treated areas visible for several days or even a couple of weeks after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
      <li>I have to say that Conair epilator was really painless for me!</li>
      <li>the exact size and shape of the waxing strips.  </li>
      <li>Aside from the saved water, it&#x27;s kind of nice to have a few extra minutes in my mornings.&lt;br</li>

      <li>the exact size and shape of the waxing strips.  </li>
      <li>About four days after my first attempt, the ingrown hairs started to appear.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good epilator for a few years now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does better job than my old epilator, but it still breaks some of the hair instead of pulling it out, not as much as my old one does, though.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, to be fair - I have to give it only 4 stars because of one BIG blunder in the description.  </li>
      <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever had and the batter dies really fast.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised that the process is not painful with this product.</li>
      <li>Kudos to Amazon for taking things back so easily.  </li>
      <li>It fits easy in your hand and works like the bottom of an upright vacuum.  </li>
      <li>It hurt too much.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really feel much pain.</li>
      <li>That being said, this epilator does a reasonable job,</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel much pain there waxing</li>
      <li>matter how much I beg</li>
      <li>I was very worried with how much everyone said this would hurt.  </li>
      <li>By end result, my skin was just not as smooth as I would want, especially in the bikini area.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans up very nice&lt;br /&gt;And is a reasonable price</li>
      <li>Now that I no longer dread using the epilator, I really like it.f</li>
      <li>/&gt;The hairs on my body grow slower and I have noticed that the hair is much thinner than when I began.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Conair E4 Satiny Smooth Total Body Epilator does what it claims: it removes hair.</li>
      <li>Now that I no longer dread using the epilator, I really like it.</li>
      <li>This might be a side-effect of it doing a better job than those other products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The sensitive head is very gentle on those tender areas that normally make her yell &#x27;Ouch&#x27;!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a nice handy gadget and easy to use.  It fits easy in your hand and works like the bottom of an upright vacuum.  That is there are four small wheels that spin and grab the hairs pulling them out quickly.  It seems a little less painless than waxing (and after a few treatments, a lot cheaper).  It is a lot safer than shaving as there is no way to cut yourself.  It is rechargeable and the top easily pops off making it easy to clean by just blowing on it over the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has been using it on her arms and legs and loves it.  She gave it to me to try on a small portion of my chest hair and it easily removed the hair and did not leave any marks and the quick minor pain was easily bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two size wheels.  The smaller is for sensitive spots such as private parts and the bigger on is for larger areas.  This product is an excellent buy and if you are a waxer, you will make the cost up fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> The Conair E4 Satiny Smooth Total Body Epilator does what it claims: it removes hair. There is no way around it. A product like this removes hair by pulling it out by the roots. You should understand before you buy this that is the mechanical version of waxing. There is no escaping the feeling of your hair being pulled out. That being said, this epilator does a reasonable job, is small and is easy to handle. It is thorough and the place stays smooth for some time. What I didn&#x27;t like was the implication that the sensitive skin attachment made life easier on sensitive parts. No. It was pretty brutal for me. Next time I will use a hand razor on sensitive parts. It&#x27;s over all a good epilator apart from my observation on particularly sensitive parts.</li>
    <li> Conair E4 Satiny Smooth Total Body Epilator is AWESOME!! I love it. My underarms and legs are so smooth without worries about niks.The entire unit also comes with different \\&quot;heads\\&quot; for different areas. Easy to keep clean and perfect for traveling. No more razors for me!&lt;br /&gt;WHEW!</li>
    <li> The battery its a problem.</li>
    <li> Does it hurt? Um yeah..it is pulling your hair out by the root so it feels about like you would think it would.  Does it work...yes.  To me it is worth they pain to have less hair to deal with.  I like it that it also has the razor you can switch to for touch up jobs.  I use this in the shower each morning on my legs and under my arms.  I do that for about a 3 or 4 days and then shave them again (you don&#x27;t want your hair to get too long or it will really hurt then!).  Each week there is less and less to shave so over time I hope this to be a couple times per week maintenance thing.  Your skin does seem to get used to it so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad after a week or so as it did when I first started.</li>
    <li> This review is from my sister who has been using it. At first I didn&#x27;t read the charging instructions and did not realize it takes 3 full charges and discharges before the battery is at full capacity.  So, the first time I used it I was only able to get thru one leg and the other leg on the next charge before it kept shutting off.  I really thought it was broken at first or had a bad battery.  But, after 3 or 4 full cycles - it holds a charge just fine and really does act as an epilator and as a shaver. The 3 or 4 cycles have to be full charge and discharge cycles - otherwise it really does appear to be broken.  I use the epilator on my legs and like that it also has a smaller sensitive epilator for more sensitive areas.  Some might consider numbing gel, especially on the sensitive areas - like under the arms.  It also comes with grooming tools. So basically it comes with nice and useful accessories and can&#x27;t imagine anyone not being happy with the flexibility of it - even includes a cleaning brush.  As an added bonus - it really is light and easy to grip and has a nice tasteful look to it.  I love it!  However, to be fair - I have to give it only 4 stars because of one BIG blunder in the description.  It says it can be used with a cord or cordless.  Either mine really is broken or that description is just outright wrong.  While the cord is plugged in - it will NOT power on at all!  The other reason for the 4 stars is the tedious manner in which the unit must be almost completely disassembled in order to change out the battery.  So, as long as you are ok with it being battery powered ONLY and your battery doesn&#x27;t require changing - it works and is great!</li>
    <li> Sometimes I tend to have issues with epilators skipping; missing hairs and making me have to go over and over the same spot and cause more pain than necessary.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with this epilator. This epilator goes its job and does it well.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good epilator for a few years now. This is it.</li>
    <li> This razor is a great item for women.  It has several different razors for various parts of the body.  It leaves a smooth feeling to the shaven area.  I highly recommend this item to women that want to get rid of the hair....  A must have item..</li>
    <li> This epilator has its good points and its bad points.  The main bad point is it is quite painful but I was expecting a little pain but was hoping for alittle less pain.  A good point is the ease of cleaning.  It is very easy to clean with the removable heads and the brush for cleaning.  Will use occasionally because of the pain factor.</li>
    <li> Bought in Dec to remove some small areas of facial hair. I fully charged it and that charge lasted two uses then I charged it again and the battery didn&#x27;t last a single use.  I am still using it but I have to get what I can then charge it and use it again the next day to get the rest because it just wont hold a charge.  Worked great and fairly painless when I first used but that is pointless if it only worked a few times before needing replaced.</li>
    <li> 11/13/2013 update: I don&#x27;t have much to add at this point, but I wanted to mention that after another month an a half I have almost no pain at all while using this, just the occasional feeling of one hair being removed.  It is no more painful than tweezing my eyebrows.  The number of days between uses seems to be getting longer, because it isn&#x27;t necessary to use it often anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am really coming to appreciate cutting my shower time in half.  Aside from the saved water, it&#x27;s kind of nice to have a few extra minutes in my mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain was a significant factor at first.  Once that was finished, this epilator has had a lot of advantages and no real disadvantages for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original 9/30/2013 review: A few years ago I tried an epilator that caused so much pain that it reminded me of a second degree burn.  So when I got this epilator the sane part of my brain wanted to know why I was doing this to myself again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out that this one wasn&#x27;t so bad.  Yes, that&#x27;s not exactly a glowing endorsement.  It is quite painful to use at first.  But it wasn&#x27;t as bad as the first epilator I tried and after a few days the pain was far less than it was in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the device itself, I plug it in when I remember (in other words, occasionally,) and I&#x27;ve never had the battery run out while in use.  It works reliably.  The light is pretty helpful when squinting to see if I&#x27;ve missed any hairs.  The epilator and all the accessories get stored in the included bag and it&#x27;s small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s get the disadvantages out of the way first:&lt;br /&gt;1) YOW!  This thing was painful at first.  I used it in the shower the first time, and I admit I didn&#x27;t really do a good job.  It hurt too much.  For a couple of days I looked like I was moulting.&lt;br /&gt;2) About four days after my first attempt, the ingrown hairs started to appear.  Because I wasn&#x27;t really watching for them, some of them were pretty bad and I ended up with bleeding and a few small scabs.  Very sharp pointed-tip tweezers [[ASIN:B00524V184 like these]] helped a lot with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;3) You&#x27;ve probably already guessed that you&#x27;d better have no plans to make the treated areas visible for several days or even a couple of weeks after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;4) The shaving head is not that great.  It&#x27;s better than nothing and works if needed, but then shaving isn&#x27;t the reason to buy an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;1) Now that I&#x27;m past the initial few painful days, it isn&#x27;t really very painful at all.  It feels like I&#x27;m tweezing the occasional stray hair.  It&#x27;s more uncomfortable than shaving, but not by much.&lt;br /&gt;2) If I have to miss a day or two, no problem.  My legs still look like I took the time to shave this morning.  When I was shaving this was not an option because I have very thick dark hair, and it grew back quickly.&lt;br /&gt;3) There were other areas I used to wax, and this is far less painful than waxing.  And I no longer get a red, swollen, and irritated area the exact size and shape of the waxing strips.  After about a month, I can use this and run out the door.  I couldn&#x27;t do that when I was waxing.&lt;br /&gt;4) Beyond the initial purchase, this is far cheaper than shaving or waxing.  There are no additional blades, gels or creams, wax, strips, or other things to buy.  I don&#x27;t know how long this epilator will last, but it seems well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get past the first couple of days of painful use, and the first couple of weeks of healing and hiding the skin, this works well and is cheaper than other hair removal options.  Now that I no longer dread using the epilator, I really like it.f them were pretty bad and I ended up with bleeding and a few small scabs.

    <li> I&#x27;m torn on whether it would be good for first time epilator users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;It has a razor attachment, so if you decide epilating isn&#x27;t for you, you can just use it as an electric razor.  It&#x27;s comparable to other razors in that price range.&lt;br /&gt;It has attachments for everything, the face, the body, the bikini.  It&#x27;s all you need in one cute package.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans easily and comes will all the supplies you&#x27;ll need, including a storage pouch.&lt;br /&gt;It does a very good job, much better than other epilators I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little more ouchy than others I&#x27;ve tried.  I mean, it doesn&#x27;t hurt -- think lots and lots of tweezers going at once -- but it stings a tiny bit more than I&#x27;ve experienced with other products.  This might be a side-effect of it doing a better job than those other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For experiences epilator users, there is no doubt.  This is an excellent all-inclusive high-quality model.</li>
    <li> I returned mine since it would not power up no matter what I did to it.  Mine appeared to have been a returned item when I received it - so I was not super surprised that it had issues.  Kudos to Amazon for taking things back so easily.  Just wish they would not send them out at all if someone has returned them.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, especially in regards to hair removal (waxing doesn&#x27;t register and laser hair removal was tolerable), but this epilator hurt!!  Following the instructions, I tested the epilator out on the wet skin of my legs.  It hurt so much that I couldn&#x27;t even do the lower half of one leg before I couldn&#x27;t take the pain.  For the small section that I did, the hair was removed well.  I then switched to the attachment for sensitive areas to see how it was.  No pain, but hair removal was not very successful as it took a number of passes.  On a second attempt that was done after a shower with dried skin, hair removal with the sensitive attachment was better though it was still very painful with the full-power attachment.  I do appreciate the light which makes it easy to see if you&#x27;ve left any stray hairs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to review an item when it keeps shutting down. I have charged this unit four times according to the directions. I have used it wet and dry. It keeps shutting off after about 20 - 40 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;Item is very pretty but if it doesn&#x27;t work who cares.</li>
    <li> Review of Conair E4 Total body Epilator. I have for a time, longed for another product called \\&quot;No,No...A very expensive item around $400.00 that reduced body hair through epilator.&lt;br /&gt;So, when I was given the opportunity to test drive this item through the vine program,I jumped.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived quickly as always with Amazon prime.  Came in a plain white box, no marking, Small in size with a variety of different cutting units.  Not one instruction as to the different usage of the heads (blades.&lt;br /&gt;The only noticeable head looked like the head of an electric shaver... the others looked like a rotter, the shape curved .I still do not know what the differences between the heads.&lt;br /&gt;Three charges were needed to fully charge and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally have to shave every day  so I noticed after several usages, that the hair was not as long or thick.  It was been around 6 weeks and I have not used a safety razor since the third week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairs on my body grow slower and I have noticed that the hair is much thinner than when I began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer wish to win a lottery to purchase the \\&quot;No, No Pro .  And find I would&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this product, My only wish is that the packaging for retail sales come documented.:)</li>
    <li> Real lack of power, not great, if you press it a little too hard against your skin it stops working.</li>
    <li> So fair I used it on my arms and legs. I use wax to remove hair for years and I don;t have too much hair left. Also my skin get used to wax removal and I don&#x27;t really feel much pain. I have to say that Conair epilator was really painless for me! I like that. It is easier to use versus wax, because there is no preparation needed. Also after wax I have to use baby oil to remove sticky residue and skin is a bit red (red dots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have perfect results on my legs where hair grows a bit longer and on my arms I can still see short hair left. No problems with that because I understand that it&#x27;s hard to remove super short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I give it 4 stars, but after I try to use it in my bikini area I will update results. I don&#x27;t feel much pain there waxing so I&#x27;m not worry about that. I&#x27;m curious how smooth will be the skin, if the epilator will pick every single hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how the underarms area would work because I did laser hair removal and I&#x27;m bold there (highly recommended!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilator is light, fits great in my hand. I&#x27;m not sure how convenient is to use under the shower, maybe bath is ok, but I prefer to use it on the dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last note, cute box or better- pouch for storage and travel would be awesome, unfortunately it came in the simplest box.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in trying an epilator for a long time, so I jumped at the chance to review this product. As an epilation newbie, I have just one word: \\&quot;OUCH!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never thought of myself as having extra sensitive skin or having a low pain tolerance, but wow! I tried using the product on my arm, leg, face (with the smaller sensitive attachment), and toes. The only area I could stand to use it on for any length of time was my toes. And it does a great job there--as I&#x27;m sure it would everywhere else if I could only stand the pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do think this is a good product ... it&#x27;s just not the product for me.</li>
    <li> ouch! I&#x27;m new to trying an epilator and it ended up not being my cup of tea, but the product works as advertised and the trimmer attachment is pretty nice. It charged quickly and has kept it&#x27;s charge very nicely. If you are someone used to this kind of product, this appears to be a solid choice to buy.</li>
    <li> This product comes with three heads; large and small epilator blades and a sensitive. It comes partially charged, but really needs three full hours before using the first time. The directions, if you have never used an epilator before, are not too clear on how to attach the blade heads, but it is easy to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may use this in the shower, but there are warnings not to totally submerge the epilator. I guess that means it is water resistant, but not water proof. If you plan to use the epilator on your legs or underarms and you are not in the shower, then I highly suggest doing so immediately following your shower. Do not wait until your skin cools down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning, if you have never used an epilator, then your skin may be a little bit irritated the first few times you use it, but that will cease. (This is my first, so I was happy to read the warning because it DID irritate my skin the first time. But not since then.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, this epilator can be used for your entire body, especially in bikini season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used an epilator before, but I have heard horror stories about them. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised that the process is not painful with this product. It stings, but does not actually hurt. No screaming. That is always a plus, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The circular shape makes the epilator easy to hold. It (the blue section in the picture) fits into your palm. I wish razors were designed this way. A cleaning brush is included, as well as a bag to hold everything. Perfect for home or travel. I&#x27;m totally impressed with this item and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.</li>
    <li> Would not stay on! Hated it and returned it!</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever had and the batter dies really fast. It takes me days to get everything. Even if I just want to shave I have to do it in stages in between charges.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think a better epilator could be made, but I was wrong.  This Conair 3-1 Total Body Epilator is the best.  This epilator came with three different heads!  The full sized head worked very nicely to remove the leg hair and keep it gone from her legs for several weeks!  My wife used the shaving head on the fine hair on the back of my neck and it worked great to give me that neat look we both like.  The sensitive head is very gentle on those tender areas that normally make her yell &#x27;Ouch&#x27;!  I recommend this Conair epilator to everyone that likes to achieve that smooth epilator finish.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat mixed feelings about the epilator. I love the shape, it is so much easier to use then the \\&quot;stick\\&quot; shape my older epilator had, and I love the light, it really makes it easy to see. I love that it can be used in the shower, but the sliding buttons on the epilator are quite hard to engage when wet, and I am concerned that it does not have a cover for the place where the cord plugs in.&lt;br /&gt;It does better job than my old epilator, but it still breaks some of the hair instead of pulling it out, not as much as my old one does, though.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head does a good job on big open surfaces (legs) but is too tricky to use in underarms, because of the shape, it catches the skin with the sharp teeth at both edges. With one of the guards attached it does very good job trimming.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problems with battery life.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t use while charging, only runs &amp;#62;5 minutes on a full charge before dying. boo.</li>
    <li> The first few times charging it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but this was explained in the book.  This is a great product.  I was very worried with how much everyone said this would hurt.  It really didn&#x27;t too bad, but I am used to tweezing so that may be why.  The parts that hurt the worst is when it would get my skin, which it did in some areas no matter how tightly I pulled the skin.  The place that hurt the worst was my underarms, but I did them, my legs, and my private areas without a problem on a couple charges.  It definitely hurts worse when the battery is low, so I recommend using on as full of a charge as possible.  I am now totally addicted to epilating though, and for the price I paid for this I am ecstatic about it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried you here,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried you there&lt;br /&gt;Still stubble, stubble everywhere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried you wet,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried you dry&lt;br /&gt;At least the pain did not make me cry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You pull my hair,&lt;br /&gt;It breaks still there&lt;br /&gt;My legs I share&lt;br /&gt;Still got that hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my face,&lt;br /&gt;despite the pace&lt;br /&gt;the hair remains&lt;br /&gt;its a darn shame&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your battery lasts a little bit&lt;br /&gt;before it&#x27;s time for a charging hit&lt;br /&gt;So cute the kit&lt;br /&gt;all together it does fit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans up very nice&lt;br /&gt;And is a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However pleasing its form&lt;br /&gt;My hair it doesn&#x27;t transform&lt;br /&gt;Neither face, arms, or legs&lt;br /&gt;No matter how much I beg</li>
    <li> My lady uses stuff like this and for the most part she says it is good. It is easy to use and easy to clean so that is really good. The only thing is that it can be painful but that is to be expected. Recommended for any one who has used these things before. I use it on out of control areas and it works well, does hurt though.</li>
    <li> So, I was rather happy about this epilator for the first two months. Yes, it hurts (of course it does: you&#x27;re ripping out your hair by the root. Of course it hurts!), but it&#x27;s true that it hurts less and less the more regularly you use it (in my case, weekly), and I do greatly prefer it to shaving. But... then it stopped working. Two months... not, perhaps, the best buy after all. Save your money for a better model.</li>
    <li> Multi purpose. Wish it could be used plugged in as well as off the battery.</li>
    <li> I tried using this product in all the usual areas, bikini, legs and armpits. Perhaps it&#x27;s just my inexperience with the product, but I did make multiple attempts and was not pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all it&#x27;s painful. I&#x27;m not a big fan of it and I don&#x27;t think the end result is worth the pain. By end result, my skin was just not as smooth as I would want, especially in the bikini area. There always seemed to be a bit of stubble, which is unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally the battery life is terrible. I want to be able to do my whole body in one shot without recharging, but it is impossible with this product. Seems like it runs 5-10 max and the battery needs to be recharged. Also unacceptable.</li>
    <li> When it&#x27;s working it&#x27;s working. But it works for 2 minutes and then you need to recharge for a couple of hours.</li>
