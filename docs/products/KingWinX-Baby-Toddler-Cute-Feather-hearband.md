      <li>Cheaply made if you need this for halloween costume, flapper girl,&lt;br /</li>
      <li>If you are crafty and can glue stuff</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>one thing I noticed about the hair piece if you want it to fit to your childs head</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>Can see the glue and made cheap.</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>light weight.</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>But it looked terribly cheap in comparison to the pictures.</li>
      <li>with that being said, this is not an everyday headband, but wonderful for a photo shoot or special occasion.</li>
      <li>Had first seen this item on Face Book and was glad to see it available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>All in all, evening having to fix it myself, it was still worth it!</li>
      <li>FOR MY LITTLE GREAT GRAND DAUGHTER .</li>
      <li>Its a very beautiful headpiece that is too hard to wear and doesn&#x27;t even feel slightly comfortable for an infant.</li>
      <li>Love second time buying it :)</li>
      <li>Arrived relatively quickly considering it came from China.  </li>
      <li>It is very pretty, but the feather does not sit on my babies head like the picture shows.</li>
      <li>Is very chip don&#x27;t like it !!</li>
      <li>It is really beautiful, but it is larger than it looked in the picture on Amazon and it is stick straight, and sticks up high on my daughters head.</li>
      <li>my daughter most likely won&#x27;t fit it till she&#x27;s 3</li>
      <li>However-I got this with the intent of taking pictures of her in it and in that sense it&#x27;s well worth</li>
      <li>but I would not recommend it for everyday use because the material is very cheap and the feathers fall off very easily</li>
      <li>Item was super pretty</li>
      <li>Much stiffer and significantly brighter than pictured.</li>
      <li>Arrived as expected, exceptional seller.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t even waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;It looks perfect on the baby&#x27;s head in the picture but different in actuality.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
      <li>It is very cheaply made and actually fell apart within a matter of minutes!</li>
      <li>The feathers need a little fluffing but they are in good shape.</li>
      <li>Nothing a dab of hot glue won&#x27;t fix.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just in the picture at least in my experienced.</li>
      <li>I love the look of it on my girls and would order again, especially considering</li>
      <li>The rhinestone was hot glued on and fell off before I ever placed it on my daughters head.</li>
      <li>The product is exactly as you see it.</li>
      <li>The bow fell off after 2 hrs, and I had use hot glue to reattach it.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>When trying it on baby&#x27;s head, it stuck straight out (another customer posted a pic of their LO and my baby looked identical!).</li>
      <li>The feather is very large and is completely straight rather than contour</li>
      <li>I hoped it won&#x27;t happen to other costumer, it really looks nice from the picture.</li>
      <li>Very cute, but the feathers are stiff and stick straght out.</li>
      <li>Really cute, just like the picture but took a very long time to arrive.</li>
      <li>it is very pretty looks good on your childs hair when you get it to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do but the only down side</li>
      <li>The shipping time wasn&#x27;t as long as I expected and, considering the price, it is a great piece.  </li>
      <li>okay, arrived when expected.</li>
      <li>heads and to keep the feathers from sticking straight up.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was in 2 pieces when I received the headband and&lt;br /&gt;it did not lay flat on my daughter&#x27;s head even after I fixed&lt;br /&gt;it with hot glue. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!</li>
    <li> Your baby will look fantastic with this</li>
    <li> They did not lay on you head as shown in picture.  Can see the glue and made cheap.</li>
    <li> Junk. The feathers do not curl like shown in the picture. They are standing straight up. It is very cheaply made and actually fell apart within a matter of minutes! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the quality; but for the price point you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> If I felt like jazzing this up a bit, it wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad. But it looked terribly cheap in comparison to the pictures. Packaged okay, arrived when expected. Yeah, but the feathers are indeed jacked. Can one even iron a feather?</li>
    <li> Horrible. ...bad quality</li>
    <li> Cheaply made if you need this for halloween costume, flapper girl,&lt;br /&gt; ok order at least a month in advance SLOW delivery</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s supper cute but something for a doll maybe. It doesn&#x27;t form to the head like it seems to in the picture but hey if you want to dress your baby girl as a flapper, it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Had to bend it into shape but overall it works</li>
    <li> I bought this for a precious friend&#x27;s baby who isn&#x27;t due until this summer. &#x3D;)  It hasn&#x27;t been worn yet but out of the package it is gorgeous!  The shipping time wasn&#x27;t as long as I expected and, considering the price, it is a great piece.  The feathers need a little fluffing but they are in good shape.</li>
    <li> Does not look like the pic.. It&#x27;s glued in a straight line and is very stiff.. I tried pulling it apart but it was cheap and made cheap.. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Really cute, just like the picture but took a very long time to arrive. I also noticed instead of one charge on my account, it came out in small charges.</li>
    <li> Very stiff headpiece, like cardboard. This looked awful when I put it on my baby&#x27;s head. No way I will ever put it on her again. Its a very beautiful headpiece that is too hard to wear and doesn&#x27;t even feel slightly comfortable for an infant.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected, exceptional seller.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;It looks perfect on the baby&#x27;s head in the picture but different in actuality.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I can&#x27;t give any star.</li>
    <li> Cute ! The feathers are a little stiff  it that&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I would give 0 stars if I could. Item broke as soon as I opened the package.</li>
    <li> surprisingly nice. A different color pink but still pretty. After a year I think a feather fell off but for the price it&#x27;s lovely for a photo or two!</li>
    <li> Entirely too big.&lt;br /&gt;takes up the babies whole head .</li>
    <li> Look really nice but the 1st day I took it out of the package and tried it on my daughter the pieces came apart 😕</li>
    <li> so I thought I would give a review on this headpiece it is very pretty looks good on your childs hair when you get it to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do but the only down side the hair peice is  not form fitting to your childs head like the other reviews mentioned I bought the light pink one with the pink sequined bow and pink jewel on it also a a white one as well for there vintaje photo shoot at jcpenny&#x27;s/ and before going to jcpennys  one thing I noticed about the hair piece if you want it to fit to your childs head you have to use either bobby pens on it or a straight iron I just used bobby pens and clipped my childs head and put the feathers over the bobby pen so you could not tell there was a bobby in there also the hair piece will not fit straight to your childs head the feathers will stick straight up and be wreally flat other than that it was a pretty headband and my daughters looked like little flapper girls I also used hairspray to keep the headband form fitting too there heads and to keep the feathers from sticking straight up. I did not use a straight iron all though my friend also bought this did.but the headband went good with the look I was going for but I would not recommend thease for anything other then pictures there great for that and my item arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Extremely cute, but looks like it was very cheaply made. My daughter hasn&#x27;t worn this just yet but I&#x27;m pretty sure this will only last a few times of her wearing it before it falls apart. However-I got this with the intent of taking pictures of her in it and in that sense it&#x27;s well worth it&#x27;s cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with that being said, this is not an everyday headband, but wonderful for a photo shoot or special occasion.</li>
    <li> It was broken on arrival</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really stiff. When I put it on her, it didn&#x27;t shape to her head like it looks like it does in the picture. It sticks straight up, awkwardly. If you try to bend it to shape it, the feathers snap. Just really cheesy.</li>
    <li> I was afraid of ordering this item due to fear of the other reviews I&#x27;d read about the packaging ruining or bending the feathers.&lt;br /&gt;I think that all depends on the post service and how it was handled while it is in transit. The item does come in a plastic bag and not in a sturdy little box so that may be why. However, mine came intact and in perfect condition. For such a cheap price I decided to take the chance and order it anyways and I am so happy I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m adding this to a giant baby shower gift basket. It is very cute!! I can&#x27;t wait for the photos!</li>
    <li> Very Cute!  The feathers are a little stiff but for this low price they work great for pics! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Although it is cute my daughter most likely won&#x27;t fit it till she&#x27;s 3</li>
    <li> Very cute... Love it! This can go with many outfits. .. light weight. ..not scratchy. .. feathers are good quality. ..</li>
    <li> Adorable- but baby just came yesterday! Will try this on for size for another time. It is gorgeous and a must for pictures. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I simply Love it! It&#x27;s perfect!!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It finally came in after a few weeks was very pretty but has a few rhinestones missing was very upset after taking awhile to come in and I get it like this.</li>
    <li> i love this one.i haven&#x27;t tried dis on my baby cos m due on october 2014.bt still its so beautiful and cute one.</li>
    <li> Comes wrapped in plastic and flattened.  It doesn&#x27;t flare back out without the feathers falling out.  Poor quality</li>
    <li> Arrived relatively quickly considering it came from China.  I ordered two of these and one of the bows did come off almost as soon as we put it on my daughter&#x27;s head.  The seller just requested a picture to verify the defect and promptly sent another one out.  The feather&#x27;s do not curve around the babies head (some people complained about this), but I don&#x27;t think that the picture looks like they do either.  I love the look of it on my girls and would order again, especially considering it&#x27;s like $3 with shipping!</li>
    <li> I am only giving this one star because 0 stars is not an option. This headband came over a month after ordering and thus, missing the pictures we&#x27;d scheduled for my LO. When I opened the package, two pieces fell out - the feathers had already become unattached. When trying it on baby&#x27;s head, it stuck straight out (another customer posted a pic of their LO and my baby looked identical!). No matter how it was positioned, it did NOT conform to her head like the picture shows. If I wouldn&#x27;t be out shipping, I&#x27;d return this product. Instead, it is going in my baby&#x27;s future &#x27;dress up&#x27; clothes to play with, because it certainly won&#x27;t be seen in her head in public. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> For the price this headband is good. I was pleasantly surprised by it and it fit my 9 month old niece great.</li>
    <li> Brought me the wrong color</li>
    <li> The hairband looked adorable and was a great price! Unfortunately it did come unglued when I went to use it, but I just taped it to get thru pictures. Nothing a dab of hot glue won&#x27;t fix. All in all, evening having to fix it myself, it was still worth it!</li>
    <li> Lovely adornment for baby...can&#x27;t beat the price and arrived safely.  Had first seen this item on Face Book and was glad to see it available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!!,it fell apart the minute I took it out of the bag!!  So upset</li>
    <li> Ugly ! Not as in picture. Feathers are all stiff</li>
    <li> ok i decided to give it at least one star even though i never had a chance to see this product in person only because the costumer service replied when i informed them after a month that i haven&#x27;t receive this item they told me to wait 10 more days so i did. Despite of a bad review i still purchased this item ( i know my bad) because it looks good in the picture but it turned out it&#x27;s just in the picture at least in my experienced. I purchased this item last August 7 until now i am still waiting for it, I am not even sure if I am going to receive it. I hoped it won&#x27;t happen to other costumer, it really looks nice from the picture.</li>
    <li> Way too big for a new borns head.</li>
    <li> Is very chip don&#x27;t like it !!</li>
    <li> But we are going to glue it back together! It is so cute minus it breaking... If you are crafty and can glue stuff yes if not no!!!</li>
    <li> Item was super pretty but it doe&#x27;s not form the my daughter head the feathers are stiff and stay sticking straight</li>
    <li> Love second time buying it :)</li>
    <li> It is really beautiful, but it is larger than it looked in the picture on Amazon and it is stick straight, and sticks up high on my daughters head. I bought it for her 1st birthday but I&#x27;m not sure if I will use it.</li>
    <li> was jsut as pictured..It did take entirely too long to receive however..</li>
    <li> Ugly I really dont like it</li>
    <li> Feathers stand up straight.  Don&#x27;t curve with baby&#x27;s head.  I had to glue them down to the headband.  It worked for the $2 I paid.</li>
    <li> It took awhile to receive this product but I&#x27;m pleased with it</li>
    <li> Item just looks awkward on my 6 month granddaughter, the feather are different somehow.  Maybe they are not as wide as in the picture and it just look...well stupid.</li>
    <li> took a long time to get that is the only negative</li>
    <li> The feathers are too big. The bow fell off after 2 hrs, and I had use hot glue to reattach it. It looks so different from the picture.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Super cute headband. Only this is it came as flat as a board so it sticks up off my daughters head. I had to find some way to shape it so it would kind of fit like the picture. Well made though!</li>
    <li> Fell apart before I even got it out of the package and took forever to arrive</li>
    <li> The product is exactly as you see it. It looks very delicate but is really quite sturdy. So adorable. Perfect for pictures</li>
    <li> I little bit hard to wrap it around the babes head but they are so dang gone cute on them once u get it on there little head thank u</li>
    <li> Ordered two for each of my daughters, and both fell apart within ten minutes.  Horrible.  I&#x27;d give it zero stars but I cant.</li>
    <li> Beautiful but doesn&#x27;t lay on baby&#x27;s head as the picture appears.  Shipping does take awhile, however price is great! Satisfied.</li>
    <li> Poorly made. The rhinestone was hot glued on and fell off before I ever placed it on my daughters head. I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the picture disappointed</li>
    <li> PERFECT COLOR , FEEL, COMFORT , SOOO BEAUTIFUL FOR MY LITTLE GREAT GRAND DAUGHTER . LOTS OF PICTURES AND MORE PICTURES !!!!! WITH THIS ADORABLE LITTLE HEAD BAND.</li>
    <li> well the headband looks very nice, the only thing is , just like the other review sad the feathers are strait not bent and kind of sicking out, i will try to carefully bent them. we&#x27;ll see........</li>
    <li> This product was crap.  Nothing like the picture.. it&#x27;s cheaply made.  But what do I expect for 2 bucks... it doesn&#x27;t deserve 1 star.</li>
    <li> If I could give no stars I would. When I received my order I was very excited until I opened it. The package was crawling with ANTS!!! INSIDE!!! They had to be there for quite sometime because there was ant larvae inside with my headband I ordered. Very gross I threw it away!! Very unimpressed. .Beware!</li>
    <li> I love this product it is beautiful for taking photos but I would not recommend it for everyday use because the material is very cheap and the feathers fall off very easily it is easy to glue back together but not for everyday use  still love it though</li>
    <li> Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. Didn&#x27;t even bother trying this on my daughter after it arrived. The bow was just horrendously huge and ugly, made from cheap material. The &amp;#34;feathers&amp;#34;...even worse - fake and cheap.  Would never recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Much stiffer and significantly brighter than pictured.</li>
    <li> i took it out of the package and the bow just fell off !!</li>
    <li> Very cute, but the feathers are stiff and stick straght out. You have to work with them to bend them.</li>
    <li> ALL EXCELLENT, VERY GRATEFUL</li>
    <li> It is very pretty, but the feather does not sit on my babies head like the picture shows. The feather is very large and is completely straight rather than contour</li>
    <li> Very cute, a little bigger than they look.  My only complaint, was the packaging. Was expecting a box, not a bag..but would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> my babys head is still too small for it so i havnt used it yet but it is very cute</li>
