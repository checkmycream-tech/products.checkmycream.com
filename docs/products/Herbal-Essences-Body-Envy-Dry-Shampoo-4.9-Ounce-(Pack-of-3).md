    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell at all!</li>
    <li> Love the smell as I always have. This product is getting difficult to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Used this in the past</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. It smells very good and keeps my skin feeling great. Very good for the price and i expected something cheap and worthless but it was the whole opposite. i will order more for sure and this will be a daily shampoo for me!</li>
    <li> came quick and as expected! so happy with it!</li>
    <li> 1. Value for money.&lt;br /&gt;2. Was skeptical if its the authentic shampoo. No issues so far.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have been using this product since I was a teenager. My mother got it for me thinking I might be able to use it and it wouldn&#x27;t allergic reaction and it didn&#x27;t...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad they brought this classic back. Smells amazing &amp; gets my hair clean, love!</li>
    <li> The smell of this shampoo is just amazing!</li>
    <li> The scent is heavenly! Great price, too.</li>
    <li> Good, I will buy it next time.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m so glad they brought it back. I wasted so much money on high end stuff but this stuff is by far the best. Smells terrific, cleans thoroughly and doesn&#x27;t make my hair fall out in the shower!!  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite! Was so glad to find it on here :)</li>
    <li> great buy super fast shipping a+++</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing, smells amazing, and just plain blows other products out the water. I wasted so much money over the years since this first came out on salon shampoo and conditioners, until I saw this one day, and thought- man I haven&#x27;t seen/used that in forever- I wonder how well it works with my long, chemically treated, dry hair NOW? Holy. Herbs. This is BETTER than I remembered it- my hair has never shined and felt this strong &amp; soft before. My hair is so much healthier than when I was using shampoo and conditioners purchased from Saks/salons upwards of $50 a bottle for less than 13 oz. I love this collection, and I&#x27;m never going back. DON&#x27;T YOU EVER TAKE THIS AWAY FROM ME!!! (The new body was is amazing, too! Highly recommend all three as you&#x27;ll be a super soft, sexy, scented and unstoppable human being).</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! It smells like fresh flowers, and leaves my hair super soft.</li>
    <li> My hair isn&#x27;t too needy-- naturally pretty straight, gets greasy after a day or so. This shampoo works well because it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, and my hair feels clean but not dried out. Also I love the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this older version and am excited to find it on the shelves again!</li>
    <li> I think this may be the shampoo that was discontinued some time back.  Soooo glad they started making it again!!  I have lots of allergies, but this shampoo cleans my hair and my head doesn&#x27;t itch.  I plan to order more of it in the near future.</li>
