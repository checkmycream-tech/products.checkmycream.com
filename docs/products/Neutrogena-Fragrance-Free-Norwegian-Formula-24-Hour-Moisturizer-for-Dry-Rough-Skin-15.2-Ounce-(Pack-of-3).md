      <li>It is also available now at Amazon, and the Neutrogena wesite.</li>

      <li>The process went smoothly and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really upset that my favorite moisturizer has been discontinued.  </li>
      <li>This body moisturizer goes on smooth without any greasy effect - I can see and feel it working right away.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is the best - it doesn&#x27;t irritate them, and is a nice lotiony texture, unlike the thick goopy Eucerin creme we used when they were younger.</li>
      <li>but they see fit to cancel a great product &amp; replace it with a smaller in size more expensive replacement to make more money, They will lose me as a customer (and I suspect many others also)but</li>
      <li>Fragrance free is a real plus, and it doesn&#x27;t not leave me feeling \\&quot;oily\\&quot; after use.</li>
      <li>They all began to get much better when they reached the age of about 6 to 8, and now they look pretty normal except for persistent cracks on their hands and feet.</li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>they are counting on most just paying more for less!</li>
      <li>We also love the Neutrogena foot creme, and it disappeared from stores at about the same time as the body moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This product really works!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered both regular and fragrance-free and love them both.    </li>
      <li>I need fragrance free and the new red label Neutrogena has a cheap perfume smell and makes me break out.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of different lotions since I live in a really dry climate and this is by far the best lotion out there -</li>
      <li>Within a week of using this product, my feet look and feel better than they have in a long time.  </li>
      <li>This is no-nonsense product that really does the job.</li>
      <li>- I&#x27;m a very practical person.    </li>
      <li>It is nongreasy, and really helps replace and retain moisture in the skin.</li>
      <li>I like these products so much that I have given them to friends and relatives as Christmas gifts</li>
      <li>very dry, sensitive skin and the fragrance free Neutrogena Norwegian Formula has done wonders keeping my skin from becoming itchy and irritated.</li>
      <li>It is a staple in our house, we can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>My four kids all had very severe eczema when they were young.</li>
      <li>He didn&#x27;t really need to tell me that, it&#x27;s pretty obvious.</li>
      <li>The lotion doesn&#x27;t feel as nice, either, but at least it doesn&#x27;t make my kids break out in a rash.</li>
      <li>I bought the blue label product for years, and prior to this the light formula.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, and it smooths into the skin nicely.</li>
      <li>the price was not bad cheaper than other places.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>For those allergic and/or sensitive to any plant gel, extract, or oil</li>
      <li>In the matter of a couple of months this lotion has almost completely healed it.  </li>
      <li>So glad they&#x27;re still making it, or at least that some company has stockpiled it!</li>
      <li>Non-greasy, light scent, one little squeeze goes a long way.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have been using this product for a long time and I swear by it.  I have also converted others into using it!</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers: this is the best there is. My four kids all had very severe eczema when they were young. At one point, the oldest was almost hospitalized because of constant infections, but we refused to allow it. The point is, they were BAD - every time we went out in public people stopped me to ask it they had chicken pox/poison ivy. They all began to get much better when they reached the age of about 6 to 8, and now they look pretty normal except for persistent cracks on their hands and feet. They range from age 19 to age 8 now, and their skin is still very dry. This lotion is the best - it doesn&#x27;t irritate them, and is a nice lotiony texture, unlike the thick goopy Eucerin creme we used when they were younger. There are multiple bottles of this stuff all over our house, and in all our cars. You can only imagine how upset I was last summer when I discovered that Walmart, Target, and Walgreens were no longer carrying it. I checked Neutrogena&#x27;s website and it appeared to be gone, replaced by the red box stuff which doesn&#x27;t come fragrance-free, except in an $8 medium-size tube. The lotion doesn&#x27;t feel as nice, either, but at least it doesn&#x27;t make my kids break out in a rash. I&#x27;m so happy to see that this is available at Amazon, and is also now listed on the Neutrogena website again - I&#x27;m hoping that they have decided to keep making it (or make it again?) We also love the Neutrogena foot creme, and it disappeared from stores at about the same time as the body moisturizer. It is also available now at Amazon, and the Neutrogena wesite. It heals cracked heels in just a few days - my kids use it constantly, esp in the winter. It isn&#x27;t fragrance-free, but it doesn&#x27;t bother their skin. I like these products so much that I have given them to friends and relatives as Christmas gifts - I&#x27;m a very practical person.    Update: I just called Neutrogena again re this product. The customer service rep seemed to know less about this product than I did, but he didtell me that it has been discontinued. He had no explaination for why it is back on their website again. Not very helpful. He tried to encourage me to buy their \\&quot;body wrap moisturizer\\&quot;, which we have already tried and did not like. He did confirm that the \\&quot;body wrap\\&quot; (red box) stuff is NOT the same product, just repackaged, but is a different formula entirely. He didn&#x27;t really need to tell me that, it&#x27;s pretty obvious. Too bad, I guess they had too many customers. He did tell me that the foot creme is still made, so no need to stockpile there.</li>
    <li> Used to be able to buy this in stores, but now can&#x27;t find it. Looked, called, searched online to find this great moisturizer. Well worth it. So glad they&#x27;re still making it, or at least that some company has stockpiled it! Thick, high-glycerin content, fragrance-free formula for healing skin of hands, joints, feet.</li>
    <li> I started looking on Amazon for my product because it is not showing up in the  department stores where I had bought it - Fred Meyers and Walmart.  When I dis-  covered I could buy it in quantity at a bargain price, there was no doubt about  my decision.  I shall not need it for a while because I received 3 bottles, but  when I am out I shall return to Amazon.</li>
    <li> As it seems once again corporate has a popular good product but they see fit to cancel a great product &amp; replace it with a smaller in size more expensive replacement to make more money, They will lose me as a customer (and I suspect many others also)but they are counting on most just paying more for less! Oh well there are other products out there that cost less!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  My husband has psoriasis. Most lotions aggravate his condition, but this one doesn&#x27;t.  It is a staple in our house, we can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number over the years, and I always come back to this one. Fragrance free is a real plus, and it doesn&#x27;t not leave me feeling \\&quot;oily\\&quot; after use.</li>
    <li> I received my shipment before arrival date shown. The moisturizer was packaged to protect it from leaking. Would purchase from them again. The moisturizer itself is wonderful for dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin. Great product. Highly recommended. To bad it is discontinued.</li>
    <li> We love this product and would rate the fragrance free lotion as a 5 star, but we were sent the lotion with fragrance, not the fragrance free.  Now we need to find out what our options are for getting the correct product.  Unfortunately it has gotten VERY expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My husband has been suffering from some skin problems for years and has been treated by many doctors that couldn&#x27;t heal it.  In the matter of a couple of months this lotion has almost completely healed it.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers.  This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It is nongreasy, and really helps replace and retain moisture in the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for several years now and nothing else compares!  It is the best moisturizing lotion that I have found.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion and it appears to be headed out of the market. I ordered the lotion. The process went smoothly and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 12 years! I have very dry, sensitive skin and the fragrance free Neutrogena Norwegian Formula has done wonders keeping my skin from becoming itchy and irritated.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different lotions since I live in a really dry climate and this is by far the best lotion out there - I even have family members buying it (once they had tried it).  It is now harder to find since Neutrogena changed the bottle for some unknown reason.</li>
    <li> This body moisturizer goes on smooth without any greasy effect - I can see and feel it working right away.  I&#x27;ve ordered both regular and fragrance-free and love them both.    It&#x27;s unfortunate that this had been discontinued and now commands a ridiculously high price.  I stocked up on this when this was \\&quot;on sale\\&quot; here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product really works!  I had rough dry skin on my feet that my former lotion didn&#x27;t seem to help.  Within a week of using this product, my feet look and feel better than they have in a long time.  I love the lack of fragrance. A little goes a long way, and it smooths into the skin nicely. This is no-nonsense product that really does the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased 4 of these at the same time. This lotion keep my skin moistured all day and it has zero smell which I love.</li>
    <li> We have been using this wonderful product for many years. However, we were sent the product with fragrance. My wife is ill and allergic to all fragrances.  Due to my wifes illiness I was unable to meet the return policy.  I gave the wonderful lotion to friends. Lowell</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for many years just for my face. I tried many lotions and found that this one dries quickly leaving a smooth feel to your skin (Great for under pancake makeup too). Non-greasy, light scent, one little squeeze goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife she like it the price was not bad cheaper than other places. For the money its okay</li>
    <li> For those allergic and/or sensitive to any plant gel, extract, or oil this is the BEST lotion available. Thank goodness one can buy 3-packs from amazon.com. Great price and free shipping.</li>
    <li> have used this for years and years - unfortunately is does not seem to be available any longer.  had to switch to aveeno similar product which is fine, but not quite as good.  wish I could still get my hands on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really upset that my favorite moisturizer has been discontinued.  I need fragrance free and the new red label Neutrogena has a cheap perfume smell and makes me break out.  I bought the blue label product for years, and prior to this the light formula.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite lotion. I wish they still made this. I am still looking for one I like as well.</li>
