      <li>Not the miracle serum I had hoped for; however, I liked it well enough to purchase this second bottle.</li>
      <li>I have used more expensive products and this simple serum is by far the most effective.  </li>
      <li>Due to all the perfumes used in so many products, I can&#x27;t buy anything in any shops in my area.</li>
      <li>This makes my other moisturizing products work better.</li>
      <li>So, I do recommend this product, this seller for this particular serum.</li>
      <li>Gives my face a very soft feel and a glowing look!</li>
      <li>Maybe it will take a few more weeks.</li>
      <li>It will probably take a few more weeks to notice any fading in discoloration.</li>
      <li>I have laugh lines that you could possibly lay pipeline in (maybe because I&#x27;ve always looked at the absurdities of situations in my life).</li>
      <li>be a few more weeks</li>
      <li>Same exact lighting, etc.</li>
      <li>This product is the first in 20 years to totally control my adult acne.</li>
      <li>So the first red flag was when I received this product, the product label on the bottle had a major typo on it.</li>
      <li>and I bought some serum and found it to reduce my wrinkles considerably.</li>
      <li>I got this to layer over a retinol serum and, so far, it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll</li>

      <li>To my surprise, this serum really did help me battle those ever present aging lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>So far I like it.</li>
      <li>I gave this 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really know how well it&#x27;s going to work.</li>
      <li>They are supposedly a local business here in Northern California, they sell all kinds of different beauty products for pretty low pricing and they only have an 800 number for their telephone contact.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s how long it takes for the skin to regenerate new cells</li>
      <li>It says to use little on face and let dry to clean.  </li>
      <li>Needed wrinkle and dark spot help and, even though it doesn&#x27;t happen overnight, after 3 weeks I can really tell a difference.  </li>
      <li>Types, Mature, Oily, Dry, Combination , Blemished&lt;br /&gt;Great for Acne and Hyperpigmentaion,&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

<li> I do feel that my skin is more moisturized and less dry, but will have to give it at least another three weeks to find out if it actually does what it claims to do.</li>

<li> to see any change, the little bottle was less than half full..</li>
<li> I thought that was strange.</li>
<li> This serum actually left my skin feeling a little tighter and supple, at the same time.</li>
<li> At age 68, my face gets dry and flaky.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a little over a week.</li>
<li> Not what i expected from hearing about it on Dr. Oz.  </li>
<li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as tight after washing and my pores look slightly smaller, but that could also be due to the ultrasonic skin spatula I&#x27;ve been using once a week in combination with this serum.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This makes my other moisturizing products work better.</li>
    <li> Using this product in the summer or in sunny cities requires extra-good sunblock application during the day. Otherwise, unprotected skin will get dark spots easier than usual.</li>
    <li> I have tried every product out there. I did research on Niacinamide and was so excited to find t&#x60;is product because I know it is a proven agent in fighting acne. I&#x27;m not sure if the other ingredients irritated my skin, or what it was, but my acne got worse. I wish it would have worked though! I am glad it has from some.</li>
    <li> When using this it would only form a film on my face and stay like that. Later in the day, if I would rub my face it would roll up to a rubbery form, like some mid-range moisturisers do. I can&#x27;t say if it improves skin tone since I didn&#x27;t use it zealously because of the aforementioned. I doubt it would work for me since it didn&#x27;t absorb.</li>
    <li> my face looks so much better after a week of using this product. the bags under my eyes are are going away and my face feels velvety smooth. my pores are closing closing out also. good product. will buy again.</li>
    <li> A doctor recommended using vitamin B3 to reduce wrinkles and I bought some serum and found it to reduce my wrinkles considerably.</li>
    <li> I gave this 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really know how well it&#x27;s going to work.</li>
    <li> I chose 3 stars because I have only used the product for a month.  Age spots seem to be a little lighter, but maybe if&lt;br /&gt;given enough time my results could be more noticeable.  However, I would give this product 4 stars for &amp;#34;just a little dab does&lt;br /&gt;it&amp;#34;, and its smoothness.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I do not see any results with this product.  I am disappointed. Finished the bottle.  I am 85- probably too late at my age.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this too much as yet.  I need more info on it.  The instructions are not explicit enough I don&#x27;t think.  It says to use little on face and let dry to clean.  I don&#x27;t recall it as a cleanser!!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin really smooth and supple. I have tried a lot of expensive creams. This one is a winner!</li>
    <li> This product makes you skin feel smooth and radiances.  I strongly recommended special for those individuals that look for that special glow every morning.  I love it and I will continue using it.  Give it a try I am sure you are going to love it.</li>
    <li> I use this as my last step at night and have noticed even toned skin when I wake up in the morning. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as tight after washing and my pores look slightly smaller, but that could also be due to the ultrasonic skin spatula I&#x27;ve been using once a week in combination with this serum. I&#x27;ve used Clindamycin as a teen to help with breakouts and read that niacinamide was used to compare results in a study done by P&amp;G. I don&#x27;t really suffer from huge breakouts except for the occasional monthly irritation that creep up around my forehead and chin area. I received this just in time and have noticed a reduction in clogged pores and whiteheads. Again, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this alone or the combination of cleaning my pores well and using this product. It hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores or caused any irritation and is super hydrating. My skin feels supple and smooth to the touch. It will probably take a few more weeks to notice any fading in discoloration. I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> It is good for my skin and will continue to use it, not at 21 days yet , that&#x27;s how long it takes for the skin to regenerate new cells</li>
    <li> I use it daily and it works</li>
    <li> no complaints on this product! I believe it helps in fine lines. I have been using it for a month and my face is smooth and healthy</li>
    <li> I got this to layer over a retinol serum and, so far, it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll be a few more weeks before I know for sure but for now it&#x27;s a good combo.</li>
    <li> Just started using product.  Even after only a few days my skin already feels much softer and firmer.  Can&#x27;t wait to see results in 4 weeks.  Great recommendation from Dr Oz.</li>
    <li> I may not have enough. to see any change, the little bottle was less than half full..I was going to return  it. but I discharge all the receipts .</li>
    <li> I have laugh lines that you could possibly lay pipeline in (maybe because I&#x27;ve always looked at the absurdities of situations in my life). I was going out on a limb trying any skin tightener/line reducer when I ordered this. Due to all the perfumes used in so many products, I can&#x27;t buy anything in any shops in my area. To my surprise, this serum really did help me battle those ever present aging lines and wrinkles. I took a picture before I started, then after a couple weeks of using this. Same exact lighting, etc. The results were actually quite noticeable. Instead of reordering this same serum, I tried another serum....the second brand is not so good. This serum actually left my skin feeling a little tighter and supple, at the same time. I will definitely reorder this one again. Packaging was secure and it arrived in the allotted time. So, I do recommend this product, this seller for this particular serum.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this seemed to make my skin look worse on my face - somewhat puffy and baggy under my eyes which I never have normally - I might have sensitivity to ceramides possibly as I recall another product a couple years ago caused issues for me</li>
    <li> I bought it because I had seen it on the Dr. Oz show. I used it for about 5 weeks and didn&#x27;t see any changes in my skin. I have misplaced the bottle so I stopped using it</li>
    <li> This product is the first in 20 years to totally control my adult acne. Love the results! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Bought this after seeing it on Dr. Oz, and am using it twice a day on clean skin. Giving it time to work, it is too soon to tell now.</li>
    <li> Definitely is helping with keeping my face hydrated!</li>
    <li> Not what i expected from hearing about it on Dr. Oz.  I haven;t seen difference in my face wrinkles.  Not enough product for the money</li>
    <li> Not really sure if it did anything.  I saw the doctor Oz show and thought I would give it a try.  Seeing no difference.  Will use until gone.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using this product for about 2-3 years now and see remarkable results. People compliment me on how youthful my skin looks for my age.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would help with my wrinkles. It has helped a little but not like I wanted it to. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a little over a week. I do feel that my skin is more moisturized and less dry, but will have to give it at least another three weeks to find out if it actually does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> it did nothing for me</li>
    <li> I like this, I&#x27;ve only had for a couple months so not enough time to see results yet. So far I like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the face and very inexpensive.  Gives my face a very soft feel and a glowing look!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  I saw it recommended on The Doctors and looked on Amazon to see what it had to say.  Needed wrinkle and dark spot help and, even though it doesn&#x27;t happen overnight, after 3 weeks I can really tell a difference.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does in 6 months or a year!  Also, using this makes you really not skip cleaning your face on those nights when you just feel too tired cause you want to apply the serum!</li>
    <li> Very good product, recommend it.</li>
    <li> Did not care for this! Not what I thought</li>
    <li> Not worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> Nothing works for everyone, but this product works for me!&lt;br /&gt;After just one week of applying before bedtime my &#x27;breakouts&#x27; are almost gone, and my pores are visibly smaller/tighter - time will tell if it improves skin-tone and discolorations. As another reviewer commented, this does create a &#x27;rubbery&#x27; film on your skin, so it isn&#x27;t suitable for wear under make-up, but what it does, it does well! A very small amount of the product goes a long way - I&#x27;m estimating this bottle will last 30-60 days; well worth the cost for the results I&#x27;ve seen so far!</li>
    <li> Clean and non-greasy formula leaves my skin feeling fresh and light.  Many moisturizers leave me feeling greasy by the end of the day, but this is top-notch.</li>
    <li> I do like it......I mix it with my artistry moisturizer. I found if I used it by itself twice a day my skin will break out. I only use it by itself at night. So far so good. I would by it again but wish there was a bit more to the bottle for the price. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this b/c Dr. Oz recommended the ingredients. I do like it and it works as a great hydrater. I use it in the mornings and it keeps my face moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a combination of improved lifestyle, but I think it has made a visible difference even though we here in midwest are still battling cold temperatures and indoors!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks and my skin shows signs of improvement, I really like this product</li>
    <li> Yes it did soon I will order another one thamk you♥</li>
    <li> Think it very good and great on my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Gave a review already. Going to buy a third bottle.  My facial stains are definitely lighter.</li>
    <li> So the first red flag was when I received this product, the product label on the bottle had a major typo on it. I thought that was strange. So, I did a google search on the company name &amp;#34;Skin Beauty Solutions&amp;#34; and I pulled up their website. They are supposedly a local business here in Northern California, they sell all kinds of different beauty products for pretty low pricing and they only have an 800 number for their telephone contact. The website was not professional looking and again there were tons of typos and bad grammar on their web page. I personally think it looks a little sketchy, which makes me wonder if the product really contains the ingredients that it claims to have....?</li>
    <li> Does not absorb.  Unsure it does anything at all. The label does not look professional so it make me wonder what I got.</li>
    <li> I love this item, using it with my regular morning and evening routine and can see a difference after just a couple of weeks. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> It does work i have not had to get botox for over 8 months and usually i get it done every 3 months</li>
    <li> but too expensive for what it does for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;also, I do not quite get why this product also exfoliates&lt;br /&gt;it does, at least on my skin......</li>
    <li> My blemishes and discolorations cleared up in about 3 weeks.  I have used more expensive products and this simple serum is by far the most effective.  A little goes a long way. I use an extremely small amount. It will stimulate gentle exfoliation. I use morning and nights.  The product seems to last for at least 60 days if you keep in mind that all you need is a very small amount.  Just a dab on each cheek and smooth over entire face.</li>
    <li> mom loved this product</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I was skeptical at first but I saw an article on the Dr Oz show that spoke of how vitamin b3 cream can plump the skin and decrease wrinkles. I tried this cream, after 5 days my &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; is gone, and my crows feet are very much diminished.  I will be buying this on a regular basis. I use it twice a day after toner. It&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> product works good at the bginning but I don&#x27;t since continuous results&lt;br /&gt;price is right shipping good&lt;br /&gt;maybe my wrinkles are beyond help</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see or feel any difference.  but will continue to use it up.  Maybe it will take a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> At age 68, my face gets dry and flaky. I love the feeling after using the serum and it lasts until I reapply in the evening.</li>
    <li> Not the miracle serum I had hoped for; however, I liked it well enough to purchase this second bottle. It seems that a dark spot or two have faded. That is why I decided to give it another month.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> After browsing all the feedback I thought there was enough positive reviews to at least give this a try to use under my Baby Face retinol night cream. I asked if it was OK to use with the retinol night cream and received a positive YES. I tried to use it four times with at least a break between 7-10 days. Each time I would break out with pimples under my skin the following day. So, in the end I only used it four times with NO satisfactory result.  The only positive is that it has a very nice silky texture.</li>
    <li> This face serum is one of the best that I have found and boy have I used just about every kind out on the market.  I will re-order.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and my face has gotten firmer and the pores smaller. I;m on my second bottle and don&#x27;t plan on stopping!</li>
    <li> For Younger , Plumper, Firmer Skin&lt;br /&gt;Skin Types, Mature, Oily, Dry, Combination , Blemished&lt;br /&gt;Great for Acne and Hyperpigmentaion,&lt;br /&gt;This very light serum absorbs quickly into skin while it delivers 5 percent, Niacinamide Vitamin B3, to your skin.</li>
    <li> Not sure if i like it</li>
    <li> I ordered this again.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> The serum was great, noticeably plumper skin on face.</li>
    <li> Delivery was good. It was purchased for someone else.</li>
