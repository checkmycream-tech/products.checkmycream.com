<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No problem with this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much exactly what the name says: Clean...warm...and fresh laundry&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t want to smell like detergent? let&#x27;s try again: Fresh...clean...warm...dryer sheet.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, let&#x27;s look past the laundry and dryer sheet, any other notable smells? .....fresh..clean...soap? no go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to smell like you are wearing clothe fresh out of the laundry, go for it. If you are like me, where you like your laundry to smell like laundry, and perfume to smell like perfume, this is a no go. Personally, this scent is what I smell like when I accidentally overdosed in detergent or put 30 dryer sheet instead of 3 in the dryer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This perfume is the bomb!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to wearing high-end perfume, but when I was looking for something more casual, I came across this one.  I decided to buy it off the Christmas sale from QVC and I regret paying for it.  The scent is OK.  It does give a warm cotton scent, but smells very synthetic.  The design house was trying too hard to make it smell like cotton and as a result, there&#x27;s a strange note which I cannot tell.  Maybe my body chemistry is not compatible with this perfume.  Anyway, I would not buy it again and would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great clean fresh scent!</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this fragrance. It&#x27;s fresh and clean like laundry soap. I never get tired of it.</li>
    <li> I get sooooo many compliments on this. It has become my signature scent. I loooove this stuff.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey well more than a bit but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> same review as body lotion my husband wears it</li>
    <li> Stationed in Okinawa when we found this brand at a store, didn&#x27;t think we would be able to find it in the states. So I started looking on Amazon before we left Okinawa. Wife loves the clean smell. Whoever named this perfume nailed it.</li>
    <li> Great delivery and product</li>
    <li> I love my warm cotton. Smells like you just step out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Love It!  I have a dresser full of expensive perfumes and this is the only one I use to the very last drop. I keep purchasing it and recommend it highly. It smells like fresh laundry soap. Not overpowering and last all day.</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  You smell like you&#x27;ve just pulled your clothes out of the drier.  Interestingly, men seem to like this a lot.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Love this brand.</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied. Never expected this quality from such an affordable price. Only through Amazon! No wonder I keep coming here every time. Don&#x27;t settle for less.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. Fresh, clean and feminine scents are usually what I&#x27;m draw to. This smells warm and cozy. Like french soap or fresh laundry. Each and every time I wear it someone compliments it. I usually get a \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot; as opposed to \\&quot;what are you wearing\\&quot;. It&#x27;s just too bad it&#x27;s never on sale. I can go through the bottle in less than a month. :/</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loved it. She had so my compliments on it ,everyone wanted to know where she bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this product to anyone who loves the smell of fresh cotton.</li>
    <li> I know a lot of women who prefer a more &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; smell - But those more &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; fragrances tend to bother me. This one really is for those of us who enjoy just a clean scent, almost soap-like. Subtle. Very nice! Love it, love it.</li>
    <li> This smells so good; it has a very clean smell.  I wear it everyday.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, it smells like clean laundry or that you&#x27;re fresh out of the shower, it&#x27;s a great mid-day pick-me-up or refresher.</li>
    <li> Great as always...I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years.  I wish that amazon had discounts for people who purchase the same product from them several times a year.</li>
    <li> good product very slow delivery</li>
    <li> This is my favorite everyday perfume by far. I&#x27;m addicted and I get so many compliments everytime I wear it.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOODNESS. I WORK IN A HOSPITAL *NURSE*...AND I AM ABLE to WEAR THIS  FRESH&amp; CLEAN FRAGRANCE. IT IS AWESOME.

I like NEED THIS FoREVER!!!!!!!! Light but BOLD AND SOOo OOO SOFT. THIS WILL BE MY SCENT FOR THE SPRING,SUMMER AND FALL.</li>
    <li> The price was great for 2 oz but the smell is not as strong as the 1 oz bottle and does have a little different odor to it as well. Not a huge noticeable difference but definitely not the same.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragnance for years and it makes you feel newly showered all day long. I love this product</li>
