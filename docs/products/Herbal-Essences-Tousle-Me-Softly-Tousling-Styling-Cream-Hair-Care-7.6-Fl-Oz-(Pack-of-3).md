      <li>This product is great for naturally wavy or curly hair.</li>
      <li>So I have curly/wavy hair that tends to frizz easily.</li>
      <li>makes my hair easy to style ...</li>
      <li>but this stuff gives me super sexy curls.</li>
      <li>It give me just enough hold and definition, and makes my hair smell great.</li>
      <li>This product helps smooth it out and makes my hair look a lot</li>
      <li>Perfect for my daughter&#x27;s sweet little curls.</li>
      <li>It pretty much just smells good and that&#x27;s all it does for you besides ruin your hair.</li>
      <li>product is amazing for people who have natural curly hair.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say if it really makes your hair tousle more because my hair is already wavy/curly</li>
      <li>bought a 3 pack right here on Amazon in Dec 2014 for $17.25 + Free Prime Shipping.</li>
      <li>Some products I&#x27;ve used were like trying to remove Super Glue.</li>
      <li>It works better if you apply it to wet or damp hair since you can spread it more evenly</li>
      <li>Add some hair spray ((i recommend spray and play harder by Big Sexy)) and go!!!</li>
      <li>It gives just the right amount of hold.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This styling product is exactly what I needed for the finishing touch on my Tousled hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many months and like it better than other similar products.  </li>
      <li>, its crazy this has been the best product i&#x27;ve used&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can touch it as much as you want without having to worry.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to any of my fellow curly heads!</li>
      <li>Reasonable pricing and received promptly as stated</li>
      <li>defines curls, does not leave them stiff and smells nice.</li>
      <li>But thanks to this product I no longer need mousse or as much hairspray as before, it works just like the mousse only with no nasty white stuff!</li>
      <li>Most certainly not worth the price.</li>
      <li>so most product either weighs it down by the end of the day or leaves a residue.  </li>
      <li>The new price comes to over $14.00/jar.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not worth the money it makes your hair look good but ruins it&#x27;s health.</li>
      <li>I have tried TONS of products, from expensive to the cheapy cheap, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>I brush wet hair, shake to loosen tousles, get about 4 fingers full of cream and scrunch it through my hair.</li>
      <li>Herbal Essences has found a dream cream in this product and I certainly wish my local supermarkets were still carrying the product.</li>
      <li>Keeps my naturally curly hair in control.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my curls soft.</li>
      <li>They really need to bring this back!!!</li>
      <li>Works well for my hair, not sure why they did retract it from the stores and only available online.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll find something else that will work equally well at the old price point.</li>
      <li>not sure if I am using this product right</li>

<li> It also last a long time (one jar per 7-8 months with daily use).</li>
<li> I have been using this stuff for I don&#x27;t know how long.</li>

<li> It can be used on wet or dry hair, and a jar last a long time.</li>
<li> I use it when I shampoo and then again after I let my hair dry.</li>
<li> I just scrunch it through my dry hair and it gives it that &amp;#34;tousled&amp;#34; look.  </li>
<li> Blow dry with a diffuser while scrunching.</li>
<li> but you can still apply it to dry hair.</li>

<li> I wanted a tousle cream I could use on wet or dry hair, and this one does the job.</li>
<li> The three pack should last me about two and a half years.</li>
<li> No thanks.</li>
<li> It has never harmed my hair besides a few dead ends, but I&#x27;ll take that over having to constantly figure out a different way to style my hair.</li>
<li> It made some dead ends in my hair which i trimmed off a long time ago.</li>
<li> Just use really small bits at a time when putting it on dry hair.</li>
<li> You just need a little bit (about a dime size to a quarter.)</li>
<li> I like a product that doesn&#x27;t weight it down, get rid of frizz, and adds definition without making it \\&quot;crinkly\\&quot;, and this product fits the bill!</li>
<li> I am not sure what the other reviewer was talking about, my hair seems healthier than ever since I&#x27;ve been using this stuff!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve practically tried every mousse and cream on the market, which either leave my hair too stiff or too frizzy and uncontrolled.</li>
<li> I have very thick, long hair (mid-back length) and</li>
<li> It holds the curl but doesn&#x27;t give my hair a hard stiff look.  </li>
<li> I do not have very thick hair</li>
<li> It has a lot of broken strands and frizz.</li>
<li> I use to always use mousse and hairspray on my hair and by the end of the day it would always leave my hair with nasty white specs that made it look like i had serious dandruff problems</li>
<li> Why did they discontinue this :(&lt;br /&gt;Everyone</li>
<li> but no one sells anymore :(</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and you can no longer find it on the shelf!!!!! I wish the company would be it back. I have no natural curl but this stuff gives me super sexy curls. I brush wet hair, shake to loosen tousles, get about 4 fingers full of cream and scrunch it through my hair. Blow dry with a diffuser while scrunching. Add some hair spray ((i recommend spray and play harder by Big Sexy)) and go!!! Keeps for about a day or two. Just rewet.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years.</li>
    <li> For me it was way too similar to glue and left my hair all sticky</li>
    <li> takes the fly- aways right out!!!!!</li>
    <li> Why did they discontinue this :(&lt;br /&gt;Everyone I know loves it and is not finding it ANYWHERE.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably buy 100 jars if they started selling it in stores again!</li>
    <li> It made some dead ends in my hair which i trimmed off a long time ago. It&#x27;s not worth the money it makes your hair look good but ruins it&#x27;s health. It pretty much just smells good and that&#x27;s all it does for you besides ruin your hair. I would never buy it again. God bless.</li>
    <li> It holds the curl but doesn&#x27;t give my hair a hard stiff look.  I like this product.</li>
    <li> Great amount of hold with a nice scent.  Perfect for my daughter&#x27;s sweet little curls.</li>
    <li> This styling product is exactly what I needed for the finishing touch on my Tousled hair. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find in stores anymore and love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years give or take and it is the ONLY product that controls frizz, defines curls, does not leave them stiff and smells nice. It also last a long time (one jar per 7-8 months with daily use).</li>
    <li> love it....makes my hair easy to style ...gives it extra body.</li>
    <li> Great product! Reasonable pricing and received promptly as stated</li>
    <li> Discontinued product grateful to be able to find it here.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing for people who have natural curly hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I use to always use mousse and hairspray on my hair and by the end of the day it would always leave my hair with nasty white specs that made it look like i had serious dandruff problems yuck!! But thanks to this product I no longer need mousse or as much hairspray as before, it works just like the mousse only with no nasty white stuff! You can touch it as much as you want without having to worry. I was so upset when they discontinued, please bring this product back I just love it!!! :D</li>
    <li> omg Ive looked everywhere for this, its crazy this has been the best product i&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;my hair is curly, Ive bleached my hair and after I did that this was the only product that helped define my curls&lt;br /&gt;ugh but no one sells anymore :( gonna keep looking. They really need to bring this back!!!</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product for my curly hair! I&#x27;ve practically tried every mousse and cream on the market, which either leave my hair too stiff or too frizzy and uncontrolled. Herbal Essences has found a dream cream in this product and I certainly wish my local supermarkets were still carrying the product. I would highly recommend this product to any of my fellow curly heads!</li>
    <li> My favourite. Arrived as described.</li>
    <li> not sure if I am using this product right I wanted more control</li>
    <li> So I have curly/wavy hair that tends to frizz easily. I like a product that doesn&#x27;t weight it down, get rid of frizz, and adds definition without making it \\&quot;crinkly\\&quot;, and this product fits the bill! I love this stuff. It give me just enough hold and definition, and makes my hair smell great. I am not sure what the other reviewer was talking about, my hair seems healthier than ever since I&#x27;ve been using this stuff! I have tried TONS of products, from expensive to the cheapy cheap, and this is by far my favorite. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Thank God for Amazon. I started using this product about 4-5 years ago. It&#x27;s perfect for my hair style and creates amazing tousles that stay together without making your hair feel stiff. After the product was discountinued, I tried a few different/ more expensive products before I gave in and bought this. The three pack should last me about two and a half years.</li>
    <li> I wanted a tousle cream I could use on wet or dry hair, and this one does the job. I use it when I shampoo and then again after I let my hair dry. I haven&#x27;t noticed a build up or difficulty in brushing it out when I need to do so. Some products I&#x27;ve used were like trying to remove Super Glue. It gives just the right amount of hold. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for humidity!  Love it.  The local stores stopped carrying it and I was bummed because I didn&#x27;t think I was going to be able to get it again.  Keeps my naturally curly hair in control.  Got the item quickly too!!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Leaves my curls soft.</li>
    <li> This product is great for adding shine and styling ease.  I&#x27;ve used it for many months and like it better than other similar products.  It can be used on wet or dry hair, and a jar last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for I don&#x27;t know how long. It has never harmed my hair besides a few dead ends, but I&#x27;ll take that over having to constantly figure out a different way to style my hair. This stuff gives me the perfect tousled look with out having frizz, and leaves my hair extremely soft. This product is great for naturally wavy or curly hair. It makes your hair look gorgeous, and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> I use just a quarter size dab each morning after styling.  I just scrunch it through my dry hair and it gives it that &amp;#34;tousled&amp;#34; look.  I do not have very thick hair so most product either weighs it down by the end of the day or leaves a residue.  Love this stuff and am glad I can still find it on line.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, product exactly as described.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I guess it&#x27;s been discontinued because I used to purchase it at Walmart or Target. It dries &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;, so no flakes or stiff chunks unless you use way too much. You just need a little bit (about a dime size to a quarter.) I have very thick, long hair (mid-back length) and about a quarter size covers all of my hair. It has a lot of broken strands and frizz. This product helps smooth it out and makes my hair look a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if it really makes your hair tousle more because my hair is already wavy/curly but it definitely helps keep my curls in check. It works better if you apply it to wet or damp hair since you can spread it more evenly but you can still apply it to dry hair. Just use really small bits at a time when putting it on dry hair.</li>
    <li> Works well for my hair, not sure why they did retract it from the stores and only available online.</li>
    <li> This product is great for curly hair.</li>
    <li> Good product but I&#x27;m VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 3 pack right here on Amazon in Dec 2014 for $17.25 + Free Prime Shipping. That comes to just under $6.00/jar. I looked to reorder it tonight and they are asking $36.99 + $5.79 shipping. The new price comes to over $14.00/jar. No thanks. The product is good but not that good. Most certainly not worth the price. I&#x27;ll find something else that will work equally well at the old price point.</li>
    <li> Holds hair in place for hours. Is not sticky and can easily be brushed through.</li>
    <li> My short hair falls into place using this product.  Will purchase again.</li>
