      <li>I still stand by the &#x27;great seller&#x27; part of my original review as there is no problem there.</li>
      <li>It produces a rich foamy lather that seems like it would be great for healthy hair.</li>
      <li>this shampoo  is amazing,  my hair looks shiny, healthy and is very easy to style</li>
      <li>and YES this is available in the US and has been for many years!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but not for the price.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Like I said I have bought it from my salon for many years</li>
      <li>but now that i&#x27;ve used it for awhile I&#x27;m not so sure.  </li>
      <li>Love this brand of products will not use anything else.</li>
      <li>I love love love this product.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair shining and smooth !</li>
      <li>So satisfied with this shampoo</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I followed the recommendation of my stylist to use this shampoo along with the conditioner.</li>
      <li>So yes, it is maybe a &#x27;weaker&#x27; version of Ultime but does not perform nearly as well as the salon purchased Ultime in my experienced opinion.  </li>
      <li>First review I did on this was &#x27;authentic product-great seller!&#x27;</li>
      <li>It said in the blurb that the formula was sodium laureate free and it was not.</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
      <li>The salon purchased Ultime not only smells stronger but seeming cleans better.  </li>
      <li>Soon after I did the first review I started noticing some differences:  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and full of body.  </li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t get the &#x27;only available in Europe&#x27; claim which is obviously not true and that in itself should have made me suspicious.  </li>
      <li>It may not be the real thing.</li>
      <li>so I know the product performance very well.</li>
      <li>I find that I have to use twice as much and still don&#x27;t get the same hair look, feel or clean</li>
      <li>The longer I used this one, the more my hair is limp and my scalp oily which does not happen with the salon version at all.  </li>
      <li>Get rid of the harsh detergents and you will have more women buying your products.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is so nice and thick</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used the anti-frizz version of this product (and the new spray anti-frizz), as well as the shampoo and conditioning treatment.  </li>
      <li>Although it is a expensive product I love it so much!</li>

    <li> This stuff works so well on my hair, which I blow dry every day and needs extra treatment occasionally.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Kerastase products.  I&#x27;ve also used the anti-frizz version of this product (and the new spray anti-frizz), as well as the shampoo and conditioning treatment.  The scent is heavenly.  I even use this sometimes on my hands and arms as a lotion because it hydrates my skin so well and smells so darn good!</li>
    <li> There is nothing that makes your hair feel so wonderful.  I love love love this product. If you need something to make your hair shine and  feel like a million bucks. This is the product.</li>
    <li> I just love this shampoo!  My hair has improved enormously with this product.  It is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Get rid of the harsh detergents and you will have more women buying your products.  This formula stripped my hair and I had to start all over again.  It said in the blurb that the formula was sodium laureate free and it was not.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best.  Makes my hair soft and full of body.  I like this Keratase the best of all their shampoos. The masque intensive is good too.</li>
    <li> I did not have any change in my hair</li>
    <li> This did not seem to be the same quality as when I purchase it from my hair dresser.  It may not be the real thing.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It produces a rich foamy lather that seems like it would be great for healthy hair. I don&#x27;t know if it actually helped my hair but it is luxurious to use.</li>
    <li> Harshest shampoo I have ever used. I threw it out. What a waste of money</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Leaves my hair very &#x27;clean&#x27; looking shiney and bright</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo, managed to make my brittled hair softer, silkier..</li>
    <li> This shampoo is so nice and thick so it doesn&#x27;t waste product when you squeeze it out. I love it.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo has nice smell and made my hair stronger, smoother and look healthy , i think i will use this shampoo for ever .</li>
    <li> this shampoo  is amazing,  my hair looks shiny, healthy and is very easy to style</li>
    <li> Love this brand of products will not use anything else. Great for all hair types.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not for the price.</li>
    <li> Greatest shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I was worried about using oleo on my hair that is prone to get oily. I&#x27;m so glad I followed the recommendation of my stylist to use this shampoo along with the conditioner. My hair feels like it did 20 years ago before I ever color treated it. One of the best discoveries I&#x27;ve made in haircare.</li>
    <li> So satisfied with this shampoo</li>
    <li> Best hair product I have used.</li>
    <li> First review I did on this was &#x27;authentic product-great seller!&#x27; but now that i&#x27;ve used it for awhile I&#x27;m not so sure.  Soon after I did the first review I started noticing some differences:  The smell is not nearly as strong as the one I buy from the salon...and YES this is available in the US and has been for many years!  I honestly don&#x27;t get the &#x27;only available in Europe&#x27; claim which is obviously not true and that in itself should have made me suspicious.  The salon purchased Ultime not only smells stronger but seeming cleans better.  The longer I used this one, the more my hair is limp and my scalp oily which does not happen with the salon version at all.  I find that I have to use twice as much and still don&#x27;t get the same hair look, feel or clean which actually makes it more expensive than purchasing at my salon.  Like I said I have bought it from my salon for many years so I know the product performance very well. So yes, it is maybe a &#x27;weaker&#x27; version of Ultime but does not perform nearly as well as the salon purchased Ultime in my experienced opinion.  I still stand by the &#x27;great seller&#x27; part of my original review as there is no problem there.</li>
    <li> Although it is a expensive product I love it so much! It leaves my hair shining and smooth ! Fast shipping too!</li>
