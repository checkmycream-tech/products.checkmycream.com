    <li> I use this fragrance for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;Compared with other fragrances in the same range, is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Buying this perfume without doubt. Be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I like the aroma. The permanence of the skin is prolonged.&lt;br /&gt;Exceeded my expectations by quite.</li>
    <li> My sisters love this perfume. Have a nice fragrance and the size is not too bad.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells terrific, the bottle is cute, and love Nina Ricca perfume.  I will order this product again.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After Jean Paul Gaulthier Claasique (my favorite perfume), Nina Ricci just knocked me out! I really love it.&lt;br /&gt;When I pass somewhere, people just look after me saying : &amp;#34;hmmmmmmmm, what is this charming spell? Ma&#x27;am, where can I get a bottle of this perfume you&#x27;re wearing&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;And me to respond : :&amp;#34;Nina Ricci!&amp;#34; lol</li>
    <li> I gave this two stars not based on the perfume but rather based on the service. I am extremely disappointed with amazon and this order. The photo fo the product that I ordered was Ricci Ricci by Nina Ricci however after I ordered and it was shipped when i clicked on the link it registered as though I ordered Nina by Nina Ricci. I really not rather not go through the stressful return process so now if when the perfume gets here it is in fact Nina by Nina Ricci and not just a colossal mixup then i will have to buy Ricci Ricci. I will keep you updated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Okay so it seems to be a website mixup since I did receive the perfume that I ordred and oh wow is it glorious. It is strong it lasts long it is sweet woody and oh so sexy. I love it. GREAT purchase. I have updated my stars. I gave it four because they should really see to remedy that photo and link mixup on the site.</li>
    <li> This perfume is ever so lightly sweet and floral. Notice I said \\&quot;lightly\\&quot;! It is not sugary sweet or strong like roses. It is gentle and absolutely the most amazing perfume I have ever smelled. It knocked my favorite right out of the water by a long shot! This truly is what perfume should be!</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle if Nina when I was living in Paris, and I wore it everywhere I went- it smells light, clean, feminine, and I love the apple bottle.  Now whenever I wear it, I think of Paris! Irreplaceable scent :)</li>
    <li> Very nice perfume it smells so good</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and it was expensive everywhere i went but i found this offer and I ordered it and it wasn&#x27;t as complicated as i thought it would be, but i&#x27;m really satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> A magcial scent anyone would like.  Genuine product at a good price from Amazon.  Delicious, crisp scent that is not too musky but has a slight sophisticated edge so you don&#x27;t just smell like candy and apples.</li>
    <li> hello,&lt;br /&gt;I got perfume but with problems, 3/4 of it being soaked in packaging and transport, I think, and I can not use it, I don&#x60;t know what happened with it,  I wanted very much to give as a gift to my wife. Now I can not do this because of the lost of contents during transport. I&#x27;m sorry for what happened to it, but I want to find a favorable solution together.&lt;br /&gt;Kind regards, Marius Papadopol.</li>
    <li> Perfume preferences are so personal that I hesitated to even write a review. The only way to know is to try it.  That said, I tend to enjoy light and clean fragrances and am drawn to Nina Ricci perfumes.  (Usually I try a sample first and THEN realize it&#x27;s Nina Ricci, so it&#x27;s definitely not an expectancy effect!) I used to wear Premier Jour and currently have Ricci Ricci (which they sent to me by mistake for this order and I ended up falling in love with it) and Nina.  Nina remains my favorite Nina Ricci, and my favorite perfume overall for everyday use. The staying power is less than Ricci Ricci, but it&#x27;s a much more subtle fragrance to begin with.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with purchase!great smell,lasts almost all day! Everybody I know asks me what perfume it is! One of the best scents there is!</li>
    <li> Smells different on everyone! Bought it for my daughter and I love it so much i sneak into her room and use it sometimes, smells so good!</li>
    <li> purchased it for the first time .. and i really like the smell..&lt;br /&gt;its long lasting ..</li>
    <li> Girlfriend absolutely loved it, smells really good and the packaging is great. Perfect for birthday, valentine&#x27;s day gift, any holiday really. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
