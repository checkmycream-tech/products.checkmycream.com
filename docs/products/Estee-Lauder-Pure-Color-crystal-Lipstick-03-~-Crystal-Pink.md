      <li>It feels like a cheap lip balm.</li>

      <li>It didnt look like it was original product.</li>
      <li>I was surprised how many Estee Lauder items I was able to get on Amazon.</li>

      <li>like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really prefer these lighter shades.</li>
      <li>i guess that my three star rating only has to do with the color because the consistency and the quality is good but the crystal pink was much darker than i had thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Very good!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing as well.</li>
      <li>This is NOT the real lipstick.</li>

      <li>Goes on smooth but not much for color.  </li>
      <li>hope the company provide the new products (the produced date) for us.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
      <li>I am not sure the seller is selling authentic merchandise.  </li>
      <li>I bought this lipstick for my adult daughter for Christmas.</li>
      <li>The Crystal Pink is a nice color for everyday at working time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but it&#x27;s definitely not a sweet light candy pink as it appears in the picture.</li>
      <li>Pretty,but more subtle than I thought it would be.</li>

<li> The smell was really bad</li>
<li> I was disappointed.</li>
