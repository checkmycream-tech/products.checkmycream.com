      <li>My typically flawless skin had become</li>
      <li>after a week of ditching my routine product and using this, my flawless skin has returned!  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;m a product junkie and have used everything from skII, lamer, jurlique, juice beauty - and this seems to work best.</li>
      <li>Amazing!!!</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>nature and good for the skin.</li>
      <li>The original Vegecol moisturizing cream was a excellent product.  </li>
      <li>Good Bye Aubrey, thanks for the wonderful years....</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
      <li>this moisturizer is light, moisturizing, and mattifying - great for my oily nose.</li>
      <li>Why do the companies change what is a good thing, just so it will look better.  </li>
      <li>I loved the original version of this product.</li>
      <li>And of course, cost more</li>
      <li>As advertised, this moisturizer is good for sensitive skin--keeps my skin feeling nice.</li>
      <li>It no longer, like it&#x27;s cute and sweet predecessor, slips easily into a purse.  </li>
      <li>Was a great product prior to formula and packaging change</li>
      <li>Moisturizer is nothing special.</li>
      <li>super sensitive redhead, 40 year old, I need good skin care.  </li>
      <li>My skin has been more sensitive since pregnancy.</li>
      <li>First time user here...</li>
      <li>I love that I can actually understand the ingredients it contains.  </li>
      <li>If I hadn&#x27;t searched Amazon for a better price than what the local store has it listed for, I would be changing to another comparable product.</li>
      <li>The bottle is pretty, but does&#x27;t hold as much as the original white plastic container did.  </li>
      <li>, i noticed the skin wasn&#x27;t exfoliating away like it had, and was much denser or clumpy.</li>
      <li>i highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Very prone to redness around the nose and chin.</li>
      <li>This was the only way I could get the original product for moisterizing that I have used for ever.  </li>
      <li>Less is more.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this particular moisturizer or any of their products.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t use readily available products like Neutrogena or similar without developing acne or rashes from fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;However this product reduced redness significantly in a week and a half.</li>
      <li>love that it&#x27;s not filled with harmful chemicals.</li>
      <li>This new product doesn&#x27;t measure up to Vegecol and the price is double.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re</li>
      <li>This new version has ingredients I&#x27;m allergic to.</li>
      <li>this is a good product but there are other comparable products that are less pricey.</li>

      <li>I was surprised how well this worked for me.</li>
      <li>Extremely sensitive skin here.</li>
      <li>Recently, Aubrey changed the packaging, the amount of moisturizer from 2 ozs to 1.7 ozs and raised the price considerably.  </li>
      <li>This product works well for my dry, sensitive skin that tends toward redness.</li>

<li> This product works well for my dry, sensitive skin that tends toward redness.</li>
<li> Just a note to consider!&lt;br /&gt;While my skin was less sensitive</li>
<li> my skin is sensitive with a slight case of rosacea.</li>
<li> Now just another example of  corporate greed and a company exploiting a loyal customer base for few more dollars.</li>
<li> This moisturizer in particular is housed now in a ridiculously user-unfriendly container.  </li>
<li> I use to love Aubrey Organics, but sadly I see they&#x27;re changing in a negative way.</li>
<li> I found going to sleep with it after washing actually made me develop small bumps.</li>
<li> So it&#x27;s a small sacrifice for such a luxury.</li>
<li> It has gotten to the point where I have to block the container with other products to stop it from crashing to the floor.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t understand why the company felt the need to add more crap.</li>
<li> Quality and aesthetics went down...</li>
<li> angry and tiny white bumps were taking over my checks...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s now been a few days and the rash hasn&#x27;t gone down, if anything my skin is now sloughing off.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m outraged at Aubrey Organics&#x27; marketing decision to re-package its products in super un-eco-friendly containers and with packaging that clearly indicates the company&#x27;s shift to a &amp;#34;jazzier, flashier&amp;#34; look that bypasses its original customer base and appeal.  </li>
<li> And, again, unlike its predecessor, Vegacol, it&#x27;s impossible to get all of the moisturizer out because of its unnecessary pumping mechanism, making the product wasteful, on top of everything else.  </li>
<li> I recommend putting it on a few hours after washing your face.</li>
<li> When used in the morning it never gave me any trouble.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> in the winter I will go back to my Weleda Cold Cream and pray I don&#x27;t get rosacea as I do in the winter.  </li>
<li> This lotion will not be thick enough for the winter cold barrier I need to keep from peeling</li>
<li> The new formula is lacking and the price is now outrageous.  </li>
<li> sad.</li>
<li> /&gt;Price is a little outrageous, but it does what it claims and my skin loves it.</li>
<li> What a disappointment.</li>
<li> Terrible product, I would give it 0 stars if I could.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I buy a lot of Aubrey cosmetic products, and this cream is my go to for a facial moisturizer. It does not make my skin oily and does not leave any residue.</li>
    <li> My Husband and I both use daily.  Great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product works well for my dry, sensitive skin that tends toward redness. My skin has been more sensitive since pregnancy. I was surprised how well this worked for me. I ran out and am buying it again.</li>
    <li> Extremely sensitive skin here. Very prone to redness around the nose and chin. Couldn&#x27;t use readily available products like Neutrogena or similar without developing acne or rashes from fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;However this product reduced redness significantly in a week and a half. I recommend putting it on a few hours after washing your face. I found going to sleep with it after washing actually made me develop small bumps. When used in the morning it never gave me any trouble. Just a note to consider!&lt;br /&gt;While my skin was less sensitive, i noticed the skin wasn&#x27;t exfoliating away like it had, and was much denser or clumpy. Maybe it was buildup?&lt;br /&gt;Price is a little outrageous, but it does what it claims and my skin loves it. So it&#x27;s a small sacrifice for such a luxury.</li>
    <li> Moisturizer is nothing special. I&#x27;m writing this review to complain about the packaging. The container is top-heavy and I am continually having to pick it up from the floor after it has fallen off of the shelf in my bathroom. The thing goes flying with only the slightest touch on the shelf or anything else on the same shelf. It has gotten to the point where I have to block the container with other products to stop it from crashing to the floor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years. I love that I can actually understand the ingredients it contains.  Plus, it works on keeping one&#x27;s skin moisturized all day.  Recently, Aubrey changed the packaging, the amount of moisturizer from 2 ozs to 1.7 ozs and raised the price considerably.  If I hadn&#x27;t searched Amazon for a better price than what the local store has it listed for, I would be changing to another comparable product.</li>
    <li> Was a great product prior to formula and packaging change Now just another example of  corporate greed and a company exploiting a loyal customer base for few more dollars. What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> As advertised, this moisturizer is good for sensitive skin--keeps my skin feeling nice.</li>
    <li> This was the only way I could get the original product for moisterizing that I have used for ever.  The bottle is pretty, but does&#x27;t hold as much as the original white plastic container did.  Why do the companies change what is a good thing, just so it will look better.  And of course, cost more</li>
    <li> I loved the original version of this product. It was the only thing I could use on my face without breaking out. This new version has ingredients I&#x27;m allergic to. I don&#x27;t understand why the company felt the need to add more crap. Quality and aesthetics went down...Less is more. I use to love Aubrey Organics, but sadly I see they&#x27;re changing in a negative way. My last bottle of Aubrey Vegecol moisturizing cream [6] is the last Aubrey Organics product in my household.</li>
    <li> super sensitive redhead, 40 year old, I need good skin care.  I have started using this for my lighter summer lotion.  in the winter I will go back to my Weleda Cold Cream and pray I don&#x27;t get rosacea as I do in the winter.  This lotion will not be thick enough for the winter cold barrier I need to keep from peeling</li>
    <li> We had been a fan of Aubrey Organics for over a decade. My husband and I both used  Aubrey&#x27;s Vegecol products on our skin. Nothing else. Never found a product line that came close. This new product doesn&#x27;t measure up to Vegecol and the price is double.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re sad. We tried this Calming Skin moisturizer, won&#x27;t even finish the tiny bottle. Waste of money. Good Bye Aubrey, thanks for the wonderful years.... We miss you, but we&#x27;re moving on.</li>
    <li> this is a good product but there are other comparable products that are less pricey. wish they would stop using plastic.</li>
    <li> Terrible product, I would give it 0 stars if I could. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything in my life and this product after applying twice has made my skin break out into a rash. It&#x27;s now been a few days and the rash hasn&#x27;t gone down, if anything my skin is now sloughing off. I would not recommend this particular moisturizer or any of their products.</li>
    <li> I, too, will have to say goodbye to this formerly wonderful product.  The original Vegecol moisturizing cream was a excellent product.  The new formula is lacking and the price is now outrageous.  A word to the wise-note that the company that was formerly called &amp;#34;Aubrey Organics&amp;#34; is now simply called &amp;#34;Aubrey&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> First time user here...I LOVE this product!  My typically flawless skin had become angry and tiny white bumps were taking over my checks...after a week of ditching my routine product and using this, my flawless skin has returned!  Yay!</li>
    <li> nature and good for the skin.</li>
    <li> my skin is sensitive with a slight case of rosacea. this moisturizer is light, moisturizing, and mattifying - great for my oily nose. love that it&#x27;s not filled with harmful chemicals. i&#x27;m a product junkie and have used everything from skII, lamer, jurlique, juice beauty - and this seems to work best. i highly recommend!</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin you need to try this! I suffered with perioral dermatitis for 8 years until I tried AO. Amazing!!! I even take trips to the store now without having to put makeup on to cover the red spots and dermatitis sores because I don&#x27;t have any! Try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m outraged at Aubrey Organics&#x27; marketing decision to re-package its products in super un-eco-friendly containers and with packaging that clearly indicates the company&#x27;s shift to a &amp;#34;jazzier, flashier&amp;#34; look that bypasses its original customer base and appeal.  This moisturizer in particular is housed now in a ridiculously user-unfriendly container.  It&#x27;s top-heavy, won&#x27;t stand up in your bathroom cabinet without risk of toppling over.  It no longer, like it&#x27;s cute and sweet predecessor, slips easily into a purse.  And, again, unlike its predecessor, Vegacol, it&#x27;s impossible to get all of the moisturizer out because of its unnecessary pumping mechanism, making the product wasteful, on top of everything else.  And the price adds insult to injury!  Return, Aubrey, to your roots!</li>
