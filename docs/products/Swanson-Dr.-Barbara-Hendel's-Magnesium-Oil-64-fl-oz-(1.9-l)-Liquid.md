      <li>It helps so many things.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff burn your skin really bad. I was so excite to use and be able to get the same health benefits that I read about however I can not handle how bad this stuff burns.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs magnesium in their system and this is the best way to get inside your body.  It is so wonderful.  It helps with every ache and pain.  I especially liked putting a couple ounces in a small amount of water in the tub and soaked.  It gets into your system much faster and covers more of your body.</li>
    <li> A good quality product and fast shipping! I am very pleased with my purchase. I also ordered a pure aloe gel and mixed the two in a spray bottle for skin application.</li>
    <li> Great product. Timely delivery.</li>
    <li> Works great on the skin.  Put some on and get in the sun for a bit and it will really go to work.</li>
    <li> Great for soaking or for spraying directly onto skin to absorb much needed magnesium for a more balanced body.  Helps prevent leg cramps and grumpiness!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> As a new user of magnesium oil I must say its results are somewhat confusing to me.  I think if your body has enough magnesium this will be like applying a stinging after shave lotion.  If your body is craving magnesium it will probably soak it right in.  I use it on my hands at night as it does soften them nicely but then it leaves a sort of dry crustiness in its wake.  I would not recommend using this on any sensitive skin area.  Oddly, I used it on the back of my husbands leathery neck and shoulders one night and he was up a few minutes later scrubbing it off.  He said it stung and then itched so bad he couldn&#x27;t stand it.  I had used it before on him and it never bothered him at all.  Like I said, its confusing.  Its properties probably need a period of months to grasp for each individual.  There are times I apply it to my tight arms and they loosen right up...other times, like I said, it almost feels annoying.</li>
    <li> I first learned about this oil on the electroherbalism group at yahoo. It&#x27;s applied in many maladies, especially those requiring extra magnesium intake. It turns out that applying this oil externally even in small quantities is absorbed 10X more efficiently than taking oral supplements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. The recommendation is a few sprays here and there, but I just pour about 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon in my hand, rub it into my hands and slather it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes only a few minutes to absorb into the skin, but make sure you have no skin breaks or it will feel like rubbing salt into your wounds. MgCl is a salt, so you would be rubbing salt into your wounds. Be Careful! Even if you do, it washes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared the price on this item to all other MgCl oils, which are from the same source, but under different labels, and this is the best deal, bar none, probably because of the size of the package. Unknown if different labels have different processing, so I can only compare price.</li>
    <li> Caused allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I use it for anxiety relief. It does have relaxation properties, I dilute it with water and sprinkle on or spray on. Will try Epsom salts to save money, Epsom also sells a lotion.</li>
    <li> I use magnesium lotion or this oil almost daily as I can have pretty erratic results with absorption of oral magnesium supplements.  This product is a great deal in terms of how much you get and how long it will last.  I put it in small squeeze bottles. They suggest spray bottles, but alot can end up on the floor as it slides right off your skin if you do not rub it in immediately.  I find that this oil stings more than the lotion (I have Dr Shealy&#x27;s Magnesium Lotion).  Definitely avoid putting it on broken skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, husband and I use this daily. We use it for stiffness  and pain in our neck, shoulders, has cut down on the ibuprophen use. also makes a good underarm deodorant</li>
    <li> When you overdo it and your muscles rebel, just wet your hand with this oil and apply it straight to the effected area.  I&#x27;ve been pulled from a sound sleep with calves and feet painfully contorted by cramps - wiped this on and felt immediately better.  It leaves a salty residue, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  I&#x27;ll never be without it.</li>
    <li> Since my cat is addicted to this product, I purchased this 64 oz refill for my spray bottles of magnesium chloride brine mined from the Zechstein Seabed buried in pristine antiquity a mile underground in The Netherlands.  If you&#x27;re interested, Google &amp;quot;ZECHSTEIN&amp;quot; to get to the web site of this hydro-efficient mining process.  This product refills the revolutionary Swanson&#x27;s Ultra [[ASIN:B0026RCMAG Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz (237 ml) Spray]] used for transdermal applications (see my review on that Amazon page for insights into causes and cures of magnesium deficiency which is believed by many to be the root factor of most health problems which have names (maybe that should be &amp;quot;pseudonyms&amp;quot;).*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product&#x27;s potency is validated by Arzel&#x27;s reaction to it.  When I pick up the 8 oz bottle, and spray it into the palm of my hand, Arzel (my tortoise-shell bobtail cat), stations her furry presence at my feet, nosing upward with anticipation.  She remains stationary as I rub the liquid (clear brine water with a slightly oily feel) along the fur covering her spine.  As anyone knows who has lived with felines, cats do not stand (or sit) still for this type of process.  Arzel exits in turbo-activated mode when I open the [[ASIN:B0014UAJ9C Clove Oil ]] bottle... with the exception that when she has a snotty eye from an infection, she endures a drop of that oil massaged onto the top of her head (between the ears, not too near the eyes; the aromatic flow carries the essence where needed).  She has learned that essential oil of cloves will usually cure an eye cold within hours.  But if she doesn&#x27;t have a swollen, watery eye, she&#x27;ll move away from the burning intensity of concentrated clove oil.  Arzel will also endure a sniff of Anise oil if she has an upset tummy... now that I think about it, she will usually snuff at the aroma of Anise even if she feels fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An application of Swanson&#x27;s Ultra Magnesium Oil will cause Arzel to purr more loudly than under any other circumstances, with the sound fluctuating between deep rumbles and high trills.  She not only allows these applications from my initiation; she periodically comes to me for more.  What gave me the impulse to try this oil on Arzel was that I had recently noticed her spinal nodes had been more protruded than normal, which to me indicated the possibility of a worm type invasion.  I believe that magnesium, among its impressive list or cures (check this vital book for background, [[ASIN:B001ODEPY4 The Magnesium Miracle]]), will remove parasites.  Evidently, Arzel knows that.  Or, possibly she just likes how the oil feels.  As noted above, Mg oil is reputed to cure most ailments (or to prevent them when it&#x27;s in adequate supply within the system).  It&#x27;s also promoted as a natural pain reliever and mood lifter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust Arzel&#x27;s reaction in this type of situation.  I trust my body&#x27;s response to use of this oil (and of [[ASIN:B000RGPZ4S Dr. Shealy&#x27;s Biogenics Magnesium Lotion]]; see my review for info on that equally miraculous product).*  I trust reviews posted by individuals who have used various magnesium products, and I recommend reading them as well as Googling any related topics your brain might conjure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* In my review of the lotion hyperlinked in the above paragraph, I featured some of the pros of that product.  For the sake of balance, I&#x27;ll note a couple advantages of the basic brine with nothing added, over the lotion, with its enhancing ingredients blended into the Mg chloride:  1. I&#x27;m comfortable using the basic brine on teeth and gums, as recommended by Dr. Barbara Hensen on the Zechstein web site, and I&#x27;m not concerned about working with food when I have residuals of the brine on my hands.  2. I need to have on hand at least one product with nothing added or removed from the naturally occurring, pristine Magnesium Chloride brine water from the Zechstein Seabed.  I have no concerns about overdoses or becoming addicted to Magnesium, but the added ingredients could potentially become problematic with extended usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will find on Amazon several helpful products and books related to these issues, including [[ASIN:0978799119 Transdermal Magnesium Therapy]] and [[ASIN:1583331565 The Magnesium Factor]].  I plan to get a copies of those books and a few others when they come out on the [[ASIN:B0015T963C KINDLE Wireless Reading Device (6&amp;quot; Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)]].  I do nearly all my reading on Kindle, as well as the majority of my Google searches (through the ease of Kindle&#x27;s free Whispernet using Sprint&#x27;s cell tower access).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased from Amazon (using my Kindle) 5 extra bottles of the Swanson Ultra 8 oz spray, which had been reduced to the incredible price of $5 @.  I keep on hand several of Swanson&#x27;s unique spray bottles (their label design and information is appealing, validating, and helpful).  Every time I see a sadly debilitated, deathly pale person hobbling along hooked to an oxygen bottle, I wish I could hand him a labeled spray bottle of Zechstein brine water (it wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea to approach strangers in this way, but I can post reviews like this one, and I can retain a supply of this product, just in case).  If not for what I&#x27;ve learned over the past 62 years in studies of herbs, oils, and various home remedies (driven partially by a lifetime of dealing with a hypo-functioning liver), I would be hobbling along, permanently tethered to an O2 bottle... if I could hobble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Swanson, for providing some of the best products available for building essential magnesium reserves in the body, and for offering them sometimes at give away prices.  I&#x27;m hoping to be ready soon to attempt to do justice to a review Dr. Carolyn Dean&#x27;s Miracle of Magnesium (linked above), which provides excellent background on why magnesium products like these have become so vital.  One of my next Google searches will be on Dr. Barbara Hensen; I&#x27;d like to acknowledge her contribution to Swanson offering this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Appreciation,&lt;br /&gt;Linda Shelnutt&lt;br /&gt;Arzel sends purrs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAIR HOME POLICY NOTATION:  The Shelnutt household is shared with three cats, all loved equally.  Ariel and Greasy generally stay in their cozy areas, whereas Arzel often follows my ramblings around the house, which is why she is accessible to sharing my health routines.d to Magnesium, but the added ingredients could potentially become problematic with extended usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will find on Amazon several helpful products and books related to these issues, including [[ASIN:0978799119 Transdermal Magnesium Therapy]] and [[ASIN:1583331565 The Magnesium Factor]].

One of my next Google searcheswill be on Dr. Barbara Hensen; I&#x27;d like to acknowledge her contribution to Swanson offering this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Appreciation,&lt;br /&gt;Linda Shelnutt&lt;br /&gt;Arzel sends purrs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAIR HOME POLICY NOTATION:  The Shelnutt household is shared with three cats, all loved equally.

    <li> It does not do what I expected.</li>
    <li> Feels strange BUT works great!  I&#x27;ve had severe nerve damage (tremendous pain) from a botched surgery &amp; this oil has been the only thing to give me relief in over 14 years.  I&#x27;ll never go without it now.  It has even helped my husbands lower back a lot.  I rub some on him every morning &amp; he says he can really feel it help his back.  This can cause some itching or a light burning sensation on sensitive areas.  Just rinse it after a few minutes if that happens.  Wish I had tried this long ago.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality Magnesium Oil and works on a variety of ailments.  My husband and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I have been eating what seems like a chalk stick of magnesium for a year, a 1250Mg pill 3 times a day. After only 2 weeks a major fibromyalgia symptom, the inability to be awake for more than a few minutes at a time, was being releaved. After a few months I was sleeping better than ever in my life. By ten months I was exercising and running again as I had not in 14 years since a severe car crash and chronic pain following. I did try stopping in the beginning to be scientific and I found the sleepiness returning. It has not given pain relief, also it may be more wakefulness and more activity has increased pain. It is a trade, my quality of life has improved in this recent year because of Magnesium. I discovered it after something I read and because I try everything. It is an awakening when a doctor says life as you have experienced it for 50 years filled with electric shocks and pain is not typical of the human experience.    I have been using this \\&quot;oil\\&quot; which is a heavy emulsion that feels oily at first but dries in a thin film. When I sprayed it on my feet the taste of it was soon in my mouth. It gives surprising relief but not all the time. It helped both surface skin pain and deeper muscle pain. I put it on my head and face since I have nerve pain in my mouth and tongue. It burned around the eyes and taste metalic (of course).  I do not like keeping it on my skin too long and this cold weather makes a lot of washing a chilly experience but I will keep using[[ASIN:B0026RCMAG Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz (237 ml) Liquid]] it.</li>
    <li> I have tried both Ancient Minerals and Swansons. I cannot tell the difference. Thus, the far cheaper Swansons looks to be the smarter option.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for magnesium oil.  I have filled cheap spray bottles for my friends from work who have aches and pains, also, since there is so much in the jug!  It does sting when first applied and can make the skin itch because it&#x27;s a salt!  You&#x27;re literally putting liquid salt on your skin.  You can use a nice thick lotion on top of it after it has a change to get into the skin (they say 15-20 minutes) or just wash it off in the shower.  Helps me with tight muscles to relax them.  I have my significant other rub it into my shoulders and neck, and my friends put it on their forearms for tendonitis.  It doesn&#x27;t completely take the pain away, but it definitely helps.  Because of the benefits of using this oil, I have also started taking a magnesium drink supplement (Natural Calm) which has further reduced the pain I experience from tight muscles.  Using a combination of the two has really helped, especially with sleeping better and feeling more relaxed.</li>
    <li> First off, if you&#x27;re using this in a soak, i think you&#x27;re wasting your money. Dollar for dollar, you get a lot more magnesium from epsom salts. But, if you are using it as something that you rub in to areas where you are experiencing soreness, i think it works pretty well, and it only takes a few drops, really. Stings if you put it on broken/red/irritated skin, like if you had rubbed salt in it... so don&#x27;t do that &#x3D;0)  good stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff change my life.  Use for fibromyalgia.  I use it ever other day.  Tingles a bit but worth it for pain relief.  You can rub it directly on a head ache and it goes in minutes.  Regulated heartbeat.  THIS STUFF IS MIRACLE WORKING. I HAVE READ THIS IS MORE ABSORBALE THAN TAKING IT ORALLY.  I leave on the skin, cant overdose on it.  Put on bottoms of feet also.  This mineral is deficient in almost all people.  We need it.  This price is the best on net.  Read about it and you will see all the benefits of it.</li>
    <li> Great product for easing muscle pain and cramps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a month and I could&#x27;nt be more impressed. So I thought I&#x27;d pass along some helpful info. I have sensitive, dry skin and my basic rule is: If you can&#x27;t eat it don&#x27;t put it on your skin. One exeption is Dr. Bronners hemp oil soaps this oil is another. At $90 a gallon I&#x27;m not about to rinse this off, it stays on until I shower. In fact I apply it right after, before my skin is fully dry. If your like me it will sting on some areas, esspecially under arms. I can&#x27;t use chemical deodorants only baking soda which also stings. This oil works great as a deodorant but can cause some redness and/or irritation...I&#x27;ve found that aloe is 100% effective for immediate relief, (I have aloe plants) not sure about aloe gel. When used together my skin absorbs the oil more completely. I also use coconut oil on areas exposed to sunlight, the back of my neck for instance. The mag. oil alone makes that area sensitive to sunlight, add the coconut oil and it&#x27;s like suntan lotion, this may be problematic for those with longer hair. For maximum absorbtion apply the mag. oil to hands feet and inner arms. I feel almost no stinging or itching when applied there. Even better soak or bathe in Epsom salts then apply the mag. oil. I&#x27;ve found that simply by massaging with this oil that my hands prune twice as fast and stay pruned twice as long. This indicates that the imbedded calcium (as described in reviews here) is being dissolved and the tissue is becoming saturated with magnesium. My hands are pain free and playing guitar and keyboards has never been more comfortable. Musicians and atheletes really need to check this stuff out. Apply one squirt to the back of your hands before and after playing. If you have soreness anywhere apply small amounts all day and night and occasionally take a day off and/or cycle i.e. left side one day right side the next, upper body lower body etc. Your body will absorb more readily as it becomes saturated. Remember this: magnesium goes where magnesium is. Start slow, increase use, then break for a day. I gave my nephew a spray bottle to treat an infected toe, in one week he&#x27;s seen more improvment than months of antibiotic use. I also gave him calcium bentonite clay and bee propolis for anyone interested. No I&#x27;m not a doctor I&#x27;m better I&#x27;m a healer, I have&#x27;nt been to a doctor in 30 years. I don&#x27;t know anyone that&#x27;s been healed by a MD, I know many people that have been damaged or killed by MDs. Do yourself a favor and order this oil it will help you take charge of your health. Also try liquid mag. squirt it directly under your tounge wait a few minutes then drink several ounces of water, esspecially if you have migraines or nerve issues. Again increase slowly up to five times a day then break for up to a week then repeat. Helpful foods: celery, cucumber, (ceylon) cinnamin, coconut oil, flax seed/oil, raw almonds, raw honey. Limit sugar and dairy and think positive thoughts.</li>
    <li> This is a new product for me. . .I have high hopes for it.  I have noticed less muscle aches but I really just want to normalize my cellular magnesium levels for overall health.  The product reached me very quickly and I will buy this again!!!</li>
    <li> One Saturday morning I woke up with the beginning twinges of a migraine in the back of my neck. I take magnesium orally  For migraine prevention, so I decided to apply the magnesium oil to the back of my neck where the pain was starting. Within five minutes the pain had stopped. It didn&#x27;t come back and I didn&#x27;t get a migraine. Being a migraine sufferer for 24 years, this was nothing short of a miracle for me.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Saw a competotor&#x27;s ad about how great this product was for FIBRO.  Terribly expensive though; they warn don&#x27;t use any other products ours is pure.  This product comes from the same place.  I&#x27;m talking about Derma-Mag their 32 oz is 58.00.  Anyway received it very quickly one day ahead of schedule.  My 83 Mother has had shingles since before thxgiving, making this lively little lady almost a shut in.  Most pain medicine works mediocre, the shingles go from the inside of her right hip to just below her knee, well the neurotherapy does.     I did kind of steal from the other place the regimen to follow -- foot baths with 2 oz of Magnesium oil 20 minutes everydays AND spraying the Magnesium Oil on 5-6 times a day to start with.  I started her on this at lunchtime one day when I came home that night she was already feeling less pain.  Everyday she can do more and more.  Doubtful this shingles will go away entirely but it has minimized her pain levels with this product.      Now today I am just starting it, looking forward to my results.  Only one minor critism, wish the bottle came with its own sprayer so I knew for sure the dosage with each spray.</li>
    <li> Seems to help my leg cramps.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used magnesium oil and I won&#x27;t be without it ever again.  I notice a gentle relaxation when I use it.  Yes, it stings me a little, but it&#x27;s almost a good sting and it only lasts a few minutes.  However, a friend tried some and it didn&#x27;t sting her at all.  She was so enamored with it I filled up a spare bottle for her.  She sometimes has neck muscle cramps and this stuff nips it in the bud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use it right after a bath on my neck and shoulders.  I purchased it originally because I read somewhere that it might be helpful for eczema; however, I have not noticed any improvement on the eczema front (just an FYI).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any sort of cramping problems or just think you might be magnesium deficient, give this a try.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> I now use this product on a daily basis after bathing or showering.  I bought it because a co-worker recommended it for muscle and joint aches and pains and it has worked wonders on the back, shoulder, neck and knee pain that I experience from time to time.</li>
    <li> If you have arthritis or aching joints, this is a Great product, it almost instantly eases or stops pain. Its also a great oral care rinse.</li>
    <li> MUscle cramps and soreness is now a thing of the past, this stuff works!</li>
    <li> Thought this sounded phony but took a chance.  At 82 it turned out to be the best thing I could have done for myself.  It stops leg cramps in their tracks.  I would have to get out of bed and walk them out now I rub my leg with this oil and the cramp will stop in a matter of minutes.  I have also increased my magnesium intake, which I believe was low. I also use the oil on my shoulders and lower back and it has helped relax sore muscles.</li>
    <li> I believe in taking alot of magnesium supplements for energy and stamina  but as is typical of magnesium, the pills are large.  Also, taking too much oral mag capsules can cause loose stools.  I use this magnesium oil (in a spray bottle) to apply to my skin to reduce the # of pills i take and to offset the side effect of mild diarrhea which can happen albeit infrequently for me.  The oil feels wonderful on the skin.  Since the spray application is not an exact science on dosage, I will not give up the pill form but i do feel that i get enough through the skin to say it works great.  I take mag supplements to provide me more stamina and energy.  I also take potassium as a separate capsule to aid in the absorption of the magnesium.  I might also mention that this form of the oil is more able to be absorbed into the bloodstream than the Epsom salts.  I do like epsom salts but the absorption is limited which is why you can bathe in it without getting too much.</li>
    <li> Works great in a bath but harder to apply otherwise.  It absorbs really well thru our skin without any irritation.</li>
    <li> Indispensable for night leg cramps we keep a small spray bottle next to the bed on the night stand. This bottle was supprisingly inexpensive for such a high quality plant source magnesium. Thank you</li>
    <li> This bottle will last a long time.  To all massage therapists, this oil will liquify your lotion.  Either use it alone, with another oil or use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried this many different ways.  Very sticky residue left on the skin.  Used it directly on skin and also in bath.  No major relief was found for sore muscles or leg/foot cramps.  Not sure if we&#x27;ll buy it again. We got the large jug to give it a real chance to prove it&#x27;s stuff but.....so far not all that excited about it.</li>
    <li> Magnesium is the greatest discovery.  I just bought the 64 fl oz, because I know that it is going to be with me from now on.  One of my employees had a stiff neck the other day, and I gave him a spray of this ....miraculous!&lt;br /&gt;It is worth trying the small spray bottles to see if you agree.  I can not say enough about this&lt;br /&gt;Madlyn Fafard&lt;br /&gt;author, \\&quot;Secrets of the Heart\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The bottle said if you don&#x27;t wash it off it makes your skin what will it didn&#x27;t do that to mine it&#x27;s a nice while it absorbs quickly and then I don&#x27;t have to take the pills anymore</li>
    <li> I decided to try this brand of magnesium oil as it is much cheaper than the Ancient Minerals, which I have used as deodorant for the past year or so.  As far as I can tell it does exactly the same job of keeping me odor-free and creating relaxing baths at about half the price.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was talking with a friend tell her about how run down I feel.  She mentioned the Magnesium Oil.  As I thought about it later, I remember them teaching us in medical school that when people present at the emergency room with heat attack that magnesium is used to treat them frequently as a first course of action.  How could I forget this?</li>
    <li> I made a cream with it and it works great!</li>
    <li> I use daily even as underarm deodorant.  Bought a small 60z spray bottle for easy application.  It is nonstaining to clothes or bedding.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Works well, shipped fast, well packed, great price. Highly recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> The average American has magnesium deficiency to one degree or another.  If you have anemia, restless legs, bruxism (yes, the grinding of your teeth at night can be attributed to your jaw muscles not relaxing enough).  It is interesting that we need calcium to contract muscles yet if there is a deficiency of magnesium, the muscles can not relax after contraction.  This is the cause of leg cramps and bruxism.  My previous crazy dentist did not want to hear about this inexpensive cure.  She liked to say, &amp;#34;once a grinder, always a grinder&#x27;....great for HER pocketbook maybe.  She pushed me into buying a very expensive contraption that I wore at night.  I do not need it anymore.  One more note:  Different types of magnesium work for different ailments.  Magnesium taurate is good for heart palpitations, Magnesium citrate seems to relax my internal organs, the &#x27;magnesium oil&#x27; works for my leg cramps and restless legs, which can really destroy my ability to sleep at night.  I take all of these plus spirulena, which has chlorophyl (and thus it has magnesium) and then I also take raw chocolate nibs once or twice a week, one or two tablespoons mixed into your food of choice.  I like to get magnesium through food sources is my reason.  I had severe anemia for a long time, which  made me prone to magnesium deficiency.  Hope this helps someone!!!  :D</li>
    <li> I had a bad fall from 12 feet and broke both feet and wrist along with crushed facia. Got this on a friday night and rubbed it into my knee before we left for the weekend. Worked like magic. Pain was greatly decreased. I put a couple of sprays under my tongue, yuck! A couple of squirts on my beard and the bottom of my feet daily. My hair is turning from gray to natural brown in just a couple of weeks and with new supplements I am taking I am almost pain free for the first time in 2.5 years. In a couple of months I don&#x27;t believe I will have any gray hair left. My Chiropractor Muscle tested me for this and said my body wanted this bad! I was a little nervous as Ancient Minerals supposedly the same thing was triple the price. Why? This works just perfect for me. My wife likes it too.</li>
    <li> I refill my spray bottle with this, as well as add it my bath water ( about 2 ounces). I have also mixed it with coconut oil and cocoa butter and applied it after a bath and shower-AMAZING. It&#x27;s a great way to get added magnesium without having to take a pill ( although I use both the oil and take a magnesium supplement).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it may seem a little expensive, in truth if you add up what it costs to buy the same amount via spray bottles this comes out cheaper and it&#x27;s a great product. Another added plus--NO additives!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it was well worth the money and I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Gr8 product! Bulk price! Awesome! Does dry out you skin if not rinsed. Especially hands when massaging it in repeatedly.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for not only helping my clients for pain relief but to help my mother&#x27;s chronic arthritis. During a massage session I&#x27;ll use a small bit for warm compresses and I&#x27;ll make a nice recovery oil for my mom&#x27;s baths.</li>
    <li> Topically applied at the feet, it works wonders for digestive problems and minimize aches and pains.</li>
    <li> This product kind of stings when applied, to some parts of the body, such as legs, but it is helpful for Arthritus pain.  I&#x27;m sure it is good for you!</li>
    <li> Superb product. Far less expensive than Ancient Minerals, and just as effective. I am an R.N., Alternative Health Consultant. I check out products of this type very carefully before referring to clients.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for leg cramps that were getting worse.  It helped after a few days, I no longer had any cramps.  I sent a second bottle to my mother.</li>
    <li> We use Swanson&#x27;s magnesium oil transdermally and their&#x27;s has the same efficacy as the $100 product. This is a no-brainier.</li>
    <li> You do not get many \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; ratings from me but,  look this up and from the label alone,  its an easy sell.  A good 100% natural magnesium product made from a rural seabed in the Netherlands it(like most good magnesium oils) is really a \\&quot;magnesium chloride brine\\&quot;.  A very good feel to it when lightly sprayed directly on the skin. May sting on an open cut or bug bite but through skin absorption it will help most everything in your system, including nasty itchy bug bites and small cuts.  I highly recommend it!!!  One of the better magnesium products I found, and a very good value. So pure you may want to cut it some for use on older or very young people. For most families this will last for years. I made up a spray bottle of this for my mom, it may help her legs that retain water. At the least it cant hurt.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this oil.  I apply it to my legs and feet at bedtime, and have less frequent and painful night-time leg cramps.  On the few occasions that I do wake up now with leg cramps, I rub it on again, walk around a little bit, and the cramps soon ease and disappear.  Great product.  Great price.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is great for my health.  Use it when massaging.</li>
    <li> Great transdermal magnesium.  Feeling better already!</li>
    <li> This was a great value for my dollar. I have found the oil to be highly effective in soothing sore muscles.  I have had trouble with tendonitis in my wrist.  Even after physical therapy, it continued to be sore and sometimes painful.  The very first day I applied the magnesium oil I obtained immediate relief.  I now apply it daily and I am 99% pain free and all soreness is gone.  I have to confess I was truly amazed.  It is much better than taking pain pills every 12 hours.  I even use if for occasional sore muscles from over work and it is very effective.  I recommend this product to any one with muscular aches and pains.  I will continue to purchase regularly.</li>
    <li> I landscape  for a living.  Have a lot of joint and muscle pain. This stuff is amazing.  It works  for muscle  spasms  and inflamed  toenails. It&#x27;s worth  more than you pay for it!</li>
    <li> I purchased the spray, lotion and the refill and soaked my feet in it as instructed (I even emailed Swanson to make sure I did it right) and I saw little (or no) difference than if I soaked my feet in warm water. I used up almost the whole 64 oz. jug. I went through almost 2 bottles of spray too.&lt;br /&gt; I then bought myself some inexpensive epsom salts and soaked in that and I got more relief from that.  I am starting to question this new \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; as a scam.&lt;br /&gt; I walk 5 mi. a day, do yoga and I am very much in tune with my body. I find that taking 500 mg. of magnesium oxide works fine AND is a whole lot less expensive and time consuming.&lt;br /&gt; I am now soaking my feet in good old epsom salts which cost me less than 3.00 for a big 4 lb. container.&lt;br /&gt; I really wanted this oil to work and went into this with an open mind.  For me, it was not worth the cost at all!</li>
    <li> Super item.  Very fast shipping.  Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.  Much better than oral pill administration.&lt;br /&gt;Enough in plastic bottle to last several months.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I had restless legs syndrome, and when I started rubbing my feet and legs with magnesium oil, it helped tremendously! It also helps my boyfriend with his back and shoulder pain. I wanted the best buy for my money, and this is it. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> When using this magnesium oil my skin looks great, very light oil when applied and I&#x27;m receiving my dose of healthy magnesium that&#x27;s. great for your heart.</li>
    <li> Received promptly from Amazon....this stuff really works.</li>
    <li> Broke out in rash!!!!!disappointed in San antonio</li>
    <li> Perhaps my sciatica was too severe for this to work. However, I allowed family and friends to sample it and they were said that it helped relieve pain. One can feel it working once applied. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This was just as expected except the shipping was much better, it came much quicker than expected.  A very good experience.</li>
    <li> Works for me.  Clearing up excema.  Stings like crazy.</li>
    <li> Used as a topical rub for sore joint and muscles works great</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Never tried this product because it came broken from the start. Although I had asked them to wrap it carefully because of the postage, they didn&#x27;t do a thing, so i received the carton all wet full of oil. Too bad because I love magnesium oil, best way to get your intake of magnesium.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found out about magnesium oil. At my last check up, my cholesterol was down fifty points, without using medication. Using magnesium oil is the only thing I&#x27;ve done differently. I&#x27;m sleeping well, and I feel so much calmer. I have been telling everyone about my discovery. Now, my husband is using it, too. Several friends are starting to try it. I think this is a wonderful, healthful product! Some people say it stings or itches, but it doesn&#x27;t sting or itch us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you buy books about magnesium, and learn all it can do. It&#x27;s truly amazing! My two favorite books are, The magnesium Miracle by Carolyn Dean, M.D. and Transdermal Magnesium Therapy by Mark Sircus, Ac., O.M.D.. I have read several, but these were the two that helped me the most.</li>
    <li> So many uses ?&lt;br /&gt;A facial, Sore Muscles, You can feel it working as soon as you put it on</li>
    <li> Very good product. I use it a couple times a day, every day. Very good price compared to like  products.</li>
    <li> Great therapeutic for taking care of my aching muscles and joints after long hiking and biking trips. Also works for migraines by rubbing it in wear the pain is.</li>
    <li> Relieves mucsle and joint aches on contact. Wonderful product that provides much needed relief.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Thank yoU!</li>
    <li> It has worked wonders fior my husbands shoulders and his right knee. His pain without it is very bad.</li>
    <li> Have used this for several years and shared it with my friends.  Now on my 3rd bottle of it.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for this quality oil. It will last a long time. We use this oil everyday for Mg deficiency and in baths. Headaches, muscle aches, cramps, skin problems... It helps so many things.</li>
    <li> This has been amazing for me. Ive always suspected I was magnesium deficient despite leading a healthy lifestyle.  It has helped tremendously with my anxiety and PMS.</li>
    <li> If you have a magnesium deficiency, I highly recommend trying the trial size bottle.  Improvements can be seen instantly.&lt;br /&gt;I have been drinking a magnesium powder for a couple years to help stop dizziness and CFS.  Apparently, I need magnesium in my system.  Recently, my daughter bought a trial size of the magnesium oil.  She said it was good for me and would help arthritis.  So, I rubbed it into my back and within minutes my back loosened.  The next morning I woke early and felt like walking the dog.  I had forgotten about the energy benefit till half way back from the walk.  Besides, I was already drinking magnesium.  I did not expect a change in the energy.  Last night I rubbed it on my neck and shoulders.  The stiffness is not completely gone, but improved.  The arthritis in my fingers is improved too.  But the big change is how I wake in the morning.  Day two and I woke easily both days.  Usually takes me an hour to transition from sleep to awake.  I have sleep apnea and use a cpap.  I am wondering what the connection is and why my brain seems to be working more normally moving from the sleep to wake cycle.I will have to do a little more research on this.</li>
    <li> We have used this product for about a year and will never be without it again!  We rub about 4 sprays into the back of each calf every morning. Rub it into the bottom of your feet before bed and experience a better nights sleep. Have aches and pains?  Rub the area with magnesium oil and then massage in a small dot of &#x27;NOW  brand Glucosamine, MSM &amp; Arnica lotion&#x27;. The pain will be VASTLY IMPROVED OR GONE in the morning.  I have given samples of the magnesium oil to just about everyone I know and have gotten excellent feedback from them.  One friend with terrible arthritis in her knees says that it made a major difference in the pain...she loves this stuff (and her Doctor gave the OK!)!  Stopped a migraine dead in its tracks for another friend...massaged it into her temples and back of neck. Her husband tells people that it&#x27;s a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews have mentioned that it drys the skin....I agree with that.  I&#x27;ve resolved that small problem with a moisturising soap and a lotion that has a coconut oil/shea butter base...no more dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;And, please, do avoid cut or scraped skin....it will sting like a bugger and have you running to the sink to rinse it off!</li>
    <li> I just received this from Swanson. Very fast shipping! Well packaged, no leaking etc. I love Swanson so it is a no brainier buying from them.  The product itself actually works. I usually take oral magnesium, and I know it works bc I can, ahem, poop! And I won&#x27;t get sore calf muscles during the day. Well I ran out of my oral mag(off of it for a month now), and while researching came upon mag oil. Seemed sort of like snake oil to me. But it is a proven fact, what we put on our skin our bodies absorb. Let that sink in for a second as you think about all the chemicals we out onto and into our bodies. Cray. Anyways, I used a little behind my neck as it was bothering me (always does). And about an hour later I felt relief. Crazy good. I put a little of this mag oil into a glass spray bottle. I sprayed two sprays on each foot (why the foot? Because the foot has MORE PORES than any other surface of your body!). Well, this morning I had my normal mag induced bowel movement. So I am officially sold on mag oil and will be buying another of these for my parents for Christmas. Please be sure to rub rub rub this into your skin. And just simply after rubbing cover with plain lotion or whatever you use if you have burning from an open wound. I hope this helps. Buy this big, and just refill a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I kept hearing about the benefits of magnesium from several sources. I decided to give it a try. IT&#x27;S AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;It has so many uses, from lotion to condiment. Over a BBQ recently, a friend saw my book &amp;#34;The Magnesium Miracle&amp;#34; and started asking questions. A few weeks later he called me to thank me and to share the awesome benefits it brought to his teenage son who had a bad case of rosacea and acne. According to him, the magnesium cleared his skin.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as an after shave, as a lotion, as an after bath, etc.&lt;br /&gt;If you dont know squat about magnesium buy the book &amp;#34;The Magnesium Miracle&amp;#34; by Carol Dean. I visited her website, and in my opinion, her website takes away a lot of her &amp;#34;CREDIBILITY&amp;#34; as a doctor and a scientist, since -my experience!!-- it looks like her website is only trying to push to sell you products and processes.</li>
    <li> Product was super timely, no problems, definitely would use this company again - happy customer - easy and fast - just what we needed!</li>
    <li> Best product ever!!!!! Eliminates chronic pain, inflammation.. I have 2 herrniated discs in my spine, was unable to even bend down to pick something off the floor, much less go for a run. After a month and a half of use, I&#x27;m running 3-6 miles again.&lt;br /&gt;I have my entire family using this stuff, my mom with arthritis, mRNA with her bad knee, and my step dad with a torn arm muscle...all have seen significant approval almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing: the shipping is terrible!!!!! My box came with little to no cushion and looking like it was about to explode, luckily the gallon was ok. My mother ordered one too, it arrived with holes, cap missing, again shipping method is horrible, I with they would put more effort into this, I will be very upset if it came broken or punctured..</li>
    <li> Yes it did, but I dont , if it will cause my skin to break out.. A little afraid. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This oil leaves a thick and sticky residue when applied. It works for reasons applied but i don&#x27;t like the thick, sticky feeling that i have not found in ancient minerals magnesium.</li>
    <li> I think it helps. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Mg. Recommend it for sore aches.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to increase my levels of Magnesium by means of external application.  I didn&#x27;t learn until much later that if your internal levels of Magnesium are low, it makes it difficult to absorb it transdermally.  With that said, the more \\&quot;sting\\&quot; you feel in application, the more of an indicator that your internal levels of Magnesium are low.  I found that by building up my internal levels of Magnesium by supplementation, the burning sensation of this product decreased.  If you perspire profusely, experience a lot of stress - be it of a physical, mental or emotional nature - you need Magnesium.  If you are a human being who happens to occupy this planet - you need Magnesium.  I would definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I researched this product quite a bit before trying it. It sounded like the answer to all my problems, but I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference if I used it or not. All it really did was leave a very salty residue on my skin where ever I put it. My cats really liked it! They wouldn&#x27;t stop licking me!. Maybe it will work for someone else, but as for me, it didn&#x27;t. I tried applying it in several different areas, but still nothing. I was so hoping it would help....disappointed...</li>
    <li> This is my first time magnesium oil in a transdermal manner. I started using it to increase my levels of DHEA as I am now over the age of 60 and still do vigorous resistance training, which I want to continue. It is a little messy to apply, but I am willing to put up with that.</li>
    <li> I used this oil undiluted and apply transdermally. Sitting on a towel to avoid staining surfaces, I allow the application to remain on me until it dries into a fine film of crystallized residue (30 minutes minimum). Follow with a shower. Occasionally, I apply post shower minimally to underarms and belly. As others have noted, it acts as a natural deodorant (you&#x27;ll never smell cleaner), and it can improve various skin conditions. The primary benefit is that it will bring up your cellular magnesium levels, restoring your system back to it&#x27;s youthful health. This is certainly not a miracle cure, but for those who have endured [years] of stress, anxiety/panic, lethargy, depression, or any other ailment for that matter, you&#x27;re likely to be massively deficient in this one unique element. Ultimately, the effects of this treatment are much greater when you combine it with lifestyle changes that include: omitting sugar &amp; alcohol from diet, and avoiding undue stress. Depending upon your present condition, expect to apply this for between 3-6 months to feel the full effects (this bottle is more than adequate to cover that).</li>
    <li> Fantastic value and saves you money over other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL magnesium of this form comes from the zechstein sea....So, just get the one that is the best value and don&#x27;t get sucked into the *hype* of fancy brands and labels and marketing pitches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also purchase the magnesium FLAKES and make your own oil, by mixing flakes with water, for even less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00B7V6ZLO Life Flo Health Care Magnesium Flakes]]</li>
    <li> Fabulous, wonderful does everything it claims. easy to use , no burning and stinging sensation. I have recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I rub some of this product under my arms for a deodorant. It kills bacteria but also absorbs into my skin and blood stream, apparently. The first time I applied it I woke up the next morning and my knees weren&#x27;t stiff like they usually were. The magnesium oil in conjunction with zinc is the building material for synovial fluid in the joints. I got some spray bottles and gave them to friends of mine that are arthritic, they both reported that the improvement is overnight and it&#x27;s quite good.</li>
    <li> InMagnesium Oil have founde  a great  product that help my entire family with joint pains and comparing with other products as oinment, pills, now I can live pain free.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this for external use only.  Delivery awesome. Thanks,  Ana Maldonado</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything after 3 weeks, stung like crazy and left my skin white and chaulky.  eugh...returned it</li>
    <li> Love Magnesium Oil. It&#x27;s a healer. Amazon delivered on time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Like this, but will probably try different brand next time as this is my first time with Magnesium Oil</li>
    <li> I have my entire family using magnesium oil! I have severe leg cramps at night when I over-do it during the day and this has stopped them completely! My husband has started using this on his legs twice a day. His legs do not hurt anymore, even after 15 hours on his feet at work!  My dad has had severe leg cramps, like I do for most of his life - he&#x27;s been using this oil for a few months now and his cramps are gone! He was so amazed, he ordered some for his brothers who have the same problems! I can&#x27;t say enough how amazing this oil is! Now my sister is trying it for her fibromyalgia. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Awesome Company, awesome product</li>
    <li> That this product is quite a lot less oily than the Essence of Life oil I have used for years, concerned me.  In answers to questions it appears there are 105mg magnesium per mil &#x3D; 517mg per US teaspoon &#x3D;397 grams per gallon, 1/2gal &#x3D;20c per gram.  Essence of Life at 3500mg per teaspoon certainly explains the difference in oiliness.  At $19 per 8oz on Amazon Prime, 48 tspn &#x3D; 168 grams &#x3D;11.3c per gram. Yet this same oil can be bought for $49 for 32oz (or $64 to include shipping if order is under $99) &#x3D; 672 grams &#x3D;7.3c per gram (or 9.5c per gram if order under $99)  I direct apply to skin daily and do not rinse off and can say that both smart if applied to sensitive skin. Plus, even when I apply almost twice as much liquid (I use a dropper and estimate I&#x27;m applying about 1/2 tspn) I&#x27;m still only getting about 1/4 of the magnesium.  In conclusion, as I&#x27;m paying twice as much and getting 1/4 of the dose this product gets 1-star.  If someone with more sensitive skin wanted the weaker product I would buy the stronger and water it down. cheers!</li>
    <li> This supplements the tablets and together they work great. No leg or feet cramps.</li>
    <li> Great price for the product, but for whatever reason it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be as high of quality as the Ancient Minerals Magnesium Oil.  Leaves a heavy residue sometimes, on your hands and body, and just over feels a little oilier.  Still a good product, and worth the money.  But if money is not an object to you, l&#x27;d suggest the Ancient Minerals.</li>
    <li> This stuff is miraculous.  I really love it!  We spread it on our bellies and the backs of our knees every night before bed.  We sleep like babies and wake up refreshed!</li>
    <li> Odd Texture with superb results</li>
    <li> This product has changed my life.  I understand why it is used in spas -because you feel so relaxed after bathing in it.  For a fraction of the price of a luxury spa treatment, I use this product once or twice a week.  I tend to be an uptight person and this product has helped me be much calmer.  My anger doesn&#x27;t get white hot anymore, I am in control of my emotions, and I am rational, and not stressed out.  When I have a disagreement with someone or a frustrating day, I soak in the bathtub with this stuff.  I am always better afterward, so magnesium sulfate has become a healthy coping mechanism for me.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my daughter&#x27;s keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) is gone. I highly recommend this stuff to everyone.</li>
    <li> Magnesium oil is incredible. I chose this brand but there are others to try as well. Magnesium has sincerely taken me from a feeling that I was going to honestly die prematurely to having lots of energy and new positive outlook on life. I know this sounds like snake oil but you need to investigate deeper about what serious role magnesium has in the body. Say goodbye to chronic back pain, no more hand and feet callouses and hello to skin that looks almost like antiaging medicine has been applied to it, no more acid reflux, no eye twitching, no internal nervousness substituted for a nice zen calmness, constipation gone, and for me big Kahuna was an AFib diagnosis that overwhelmed me enough to find an alternative to what the doctors wanted to do to me. In less than six months I am 99% AFib free, repeat, I am 99% AFib free, AND any AFib episodes I have now  are very, very short in duration (seconds) and almost imperceptible. This is opposed to years of long durations(sometime hours) and very noticeable (very pronounced erratic heart beat). They were downright scary to experience and I knew I had no choice but to sign up for the doctors protocol or give it hell trying to find some other thing on my own that could save me from heart attack or stroke. To the readers I probably sound like a quack but I assure you I am not and I know where I am today has only to do with two things. 1. Oral magnesium drink and 2. This oil. They actually are both needed. Important- Don&#x27;t take my word on anything I say. You need to educate yourself about the importance of magnesium in the body. There are scores of articles that speak about its importance of magnesium in the body and a huge amount of the American population is chronically deficient in this very vital mineral.  If you are one that suffers from AFib not caused by a heart valve issue, you need to get Mag oil and Mag drink into your bodyTODAY! My AFib was really bad and at 58 it was only going to get progressively worse. That is what happens with AFib as you get older. The secret my heart doctor, who was also a friend by the way, did not tell me was to try magnesium supplementation because Magnesium supplementation does not make the hospital or the doctors any money. Magnesium controls calcium levels in the body and controlling calcium is vitally important. The high calcium level in my body was the main driving force in my own accelerated declining. Yet, here I am AFib free for the first time in years. So many positive effects with this downright miracle in the form of a little mineral supplementation. No doctor is going to tell you about Magnesium. You owe it to yourself to at least try magnesium. I encourage the oil and oral forms. Powder drink types over pill supplements. I am 5 months into this supplementation and things are only getting better physically. I am not one to leave feedback but wonders of magnesium supplementation must be shared to as many as possible. Good luck to you all!t happens with AFib as you get older.

    <li> Keep in mind this IS NOT OIL, but a liquid.  This magnesium absorbs well but can cause itching on sensative skin.  Use carefully.  Very please with this product &amp; Swanson items in general.</li>
    <li> I needed a large amount and was able to find this 64oz.  Perfect way to use in foot baths, etc.</li>
    <li> The only reason i&#x27;m not giving this a 5 is if I use too much of it, I get a skin rash which itches a lot.  That goes away after a shower.  My doctor said to use 20 sprays each night before i go to bed.  Too much.  If I do 10, the skin rashes diminish.  On the plus side, i was told this would help one sleep..and does it ever. I&#x27;ve been an insomniac  for forty years and I&#x27;m sleeping 7 to 9 hours a night.  I&#x27;m using the magnesium oil plus the two 200 gm of magnesium tablets.  This stuff could put Zolpidiem and the other sleep aids out of business.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this very long, but it seems that when I use it, my pain lessens, and I have more energy.  Because I&#x27;m naturally curious, I&#x27;ve been documenting how I feel on the days I use it vs. the days I don&#x27;t.  I understand that using the oil and experiencing the effects are cumulative over time, but since I notices the slight change the first time I used it, I thought I&#x27;d try to determine if the results were consistent and correlated with the use of the product.  However, since I cannot ignore a possible placebo effect, all I can say is that if it&#x27;s real or placebo - it works for me!    The literature on the use of the oil is well documented, and since it can&#x27;t hurt, I&#x27;m going to continue using it.  I&#x27;ll update as I have more information.</li>
    <li> I have read about and debated about ordering the magnesium oil for several months. I get awful cramps at night in my feet and calves, to the point that my feet actually twist. This really hurts and is very distressful, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I finally broke down and ordered it and the only negative I can say is *what took me so long? *  This really does work ! It is such a joy to not wake up in immense pain in both my feet and my legs.</li>
    <li> I use it on my hair after washing when its still wet and it leaves my hair silky and shiny. I used to use it on my body too, but if i use everyday I get a build up so now I just put on at night so in the morning I wash it away and yes I do sleep better and longer, even during the day I noticed I&#x27;m more relaxed</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this M.Oil.  I had very bad lower back pain and knees would hurt as well while being pregnant.  I would use it as soon as I felt the pain and it would go away with in like a few minutes or even less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it well.  I would spray it on my belly as well like in the mornings and on my back in the evenings. So that it wont be too much for the baby.</li>
    <li> Swanson&#x27;s magnesium oil works great for resolving dry skin conditions.  Great for musle conditions also. Swanson&#x27;s brand is less expensive than some others that I&#x27;ve tried but works just as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product! Works wonders :)</li>
