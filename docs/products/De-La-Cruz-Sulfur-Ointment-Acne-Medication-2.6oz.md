      <li>Amazing product to help with cystic acne.  </li>

      <li>Amazing.  </li>
      <li>Amazing stuff works.</li>
      <li>However, I think it&#x27;s extremely effective at clearing my pimples without drying my skin.</li>
      <li>Kind of works, I think?</li>
      <li>To be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m somewhere between a 3 1/2 to a 4 star on this product.</li>
      <li>As you can see in this photo, my struggle with acne is the hormonal, cystic kind.</li>
      <li>We are amazed at how effective this is for recalcitrant acne.</li>
      <li>Just as so many of the reviews said, this stuff is magic!</li>
      <li>anyway it was worth buying since i have the soap which is also great.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best thing I have found.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin as i do, then this product is not the best option for you.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>Quite remarkable stuff - it does exactly what it says it does!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been putting  on a very light coat and leaving it overnight</li>
      <li>I recommend Sulfur because it is easy to use and effective as an acne medication.</li>
      <li>The smell is off-putting but not horrible.</li>
      <li>Simply the best!</li>
      <li>Its not one of those sulfer lotions its more of a sulfer ointment as advertised.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but gave it a try based upon reviews.</li>
      <li>I went ahead and ordered this exfoliating mitt on Amazon, today so that I can stay on top of the &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Magic.  </li>
      <li>Made me break out even more and cause inflammation of tissue.</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s so soon in my treatment with this ointment, but I&#x27;m so confident that the results will just keep getting better and better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a superficial person, and I know my value has nothing to do with how I look, but STILL- acne is NOT an enjoyable experience.  </li>
      <li>Is this product even safe?</li>
      <li>Using it more than once a day for the recommended amount of time seems to have a better effect.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
      <li>This stuff was just okay..</li>
      <li>This is making the skin look better every hour.</li>
      <li>ordering more</li>
      <li>I looked on youtube for some reviews they were okay too.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>After trying out various pimple spot products I&#x27;ve found what works best for me is a 10% sulphur mask that I would use at night and wash off, and a sulphur based coverup to use during the day under makeup.</li>
      <li>This is one of many products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>some people mentioned an overwhelming sulfur smell...</li>
      <li>but i don&#x27;t know it was an okay buy.</li>
      <li>love how it makes my face feel.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>For me, it will replace a myriad of skin-clearing products that cost a lot more.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>didnt really work all that great</li>
      <li>I learned my lesson for sure.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to use it for awhile, though, while changing my diet to see if it makes more of a change or not.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>From my understanding, many reviewers are suffering from either oily or hormonal skin that the sulphur ointment works well on.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this because it has pretty good reviews.  </li>
      <li>This is a good place to start ;)</li>
      <li>But also helps calm cystic acne!!</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;d love to know what products you use to clean, because this does NOT smell good or fresh.</li>
      <li>It has helped clear my acne up a great deal.</li>
      <li>I am now putting on my make up on beautiful clear smooth skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Dries up cystic acne fast.. my daughter loves this stuff...</li>
    <li> Easy to use and seems to be effective in eliminating acne if used on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This product is unbelievable.  Had no skin issues AT ALL until my mid-30&#x27;s.  Went to the battery of MD&#x27;s and was diagnosed with Rosacea but I was never 100% convinced.  Embarrassed at work and in public.  An awful situation.  Used OTC treatments, prescriptions, and anything I could find.  Limited success.  Couldn&#x27;t drink or exercise as this would cause my flare ups.  Stumbled onto this little godsend on a message board and thought I had nothing to lose.  Ordered my third bottle just now.  Have not had a single flare up, not one, since I started using.  I didn&#x27;t have the overnight success that some have had but I applied at night before going to bed all over my face and left on for 10 minutes.  I then rinsed and finished with a highly diluted Tea Tree Oil/Water mixture.  Within about 10 days, my skin was clear.  I was very diligent about following this regimen for four weeks as this is what I had read on the web.  Magic.  I am still diligent in using, but if I miss a couple days, it has not made a difference.  I have read different theories on what causes rosacea, acne, and other skin ailments.  One intriguing angle was that those with bad skin could have an overabundance of demodex mites compared to the normal person.  All humans have them.  This product kills them.  I don&#x27;t know if that is the case for me, but whatever I had is gone thanks to this product.  Not trying to overpromise, but it has been a miracle for me.</li>
    <li> so far it arrived yesterday in one piece so i may need to update the review. i do have very sensitive skin and use many oils for my face. i must alternate to put the moisture back into my skin....anyway it was worth buying since i have the soap which is also great.</li>
    <li> Love it. Love it. It has helped clear my acne up a great deal. I have moderate acne. Just rinse of and use an oil free moisturizer. My daughter and friends and family have noticed a difference in my face.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time just as promised. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but gave it a try based upon reviews. I had dermatitis on my chin and up towards the side of my mouth. There is an initial mild odor when you open the jar, not bad. Even though it says to remove after 10 minutes, I left it on over night. Since my skin was irritated there was at first some warm sensation but that was for a few seconds when applying the ointment. I experienced no stinging or burning sensation. The next morning my skin was not healed but it did look better. It didn&#x27;t look irritated. It took several nights of application to have it completely go away. I later used it on a huge pimple on my nose. Again, it didn&#x27;t go away overnight but after three nights of use it did bring it drastically down so it wasn&#x27;t as noticeable. I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works fast, I have had acne since my twenties  and nothing has worked. I use it aftwr washing my face and applying moisturizer, like a spot treatment. I have only been using it for about four days and already notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Caused red spots all over my face...basically ruined my week.</li>
    <li> Great Product, worked better than expected after several other products failed.</li>
    <li> Works great for acne. Is very drying and should be used with a good moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It lasts for so long because a little goes a long way. Goodness. This is my go-to product for cystic acne or random pimples. I notice that using it everyday makes my skin a bit immune to it so it doesn&#x27;t work as fast, but if I use it once every week or so, it works super fast, over night fast. Sulfur is great to combat acne. I highly reccomend this product to anyone suffering from skin problems.</li>
    <li> Almost totally gone this morning! I am a little freaked out because I too have tried so many things without any help. I never had acne until this year. Its probably stress hormone related and/or my diet. Who knows? All I know is I slapped this on before bed and 8 hours later my skin is clearer than it has been in months. The BH/wh and cysts are all near gone! Thanks for the product. After the darkness fades I&#x27;ll post a b&amp;a pic.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for my skin other than made it peel very bad.</li>
    <li> Due to hormonal acne, I break out along my jaw all the time, pretty much every day, but after I started using this, I have not had a single breakout. I&#x27;ve been putting  on a very light coat and leaving it overnight, so I am experiencing some peeling around my scars. My plan is to use it this way for a couple more days, and then just use it every other day or less. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Odor horrific like rotten eggs worst product I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
    <li> After searching for 3-4 years for an affordable product to clear my skin I found this and it&#x27;s been amazing!! Cleared horrible, scaly rosacea after using for a few weeks. If recommend continued use for the best outcome. However, I only use it in &amp;#34;trouble&amp;#34; areas once a day, any more than that and it makes skin very dry.</li>
    <li> really great product!!!  it works!</li>
    <li> This review is premature, but I&#x27;m that excited. As you can see in this photo, my struggle with acne is the hormonal, cystic kind. There isn&#x27;t anything I have not tried. Chemical peels, Proactiv (both versions), Murad, Aczone, Epiduo, liver cleanses, hormonal birth control, Acnepril, Estroblock.. you get it. The effects of acne have been so damaging, much deeper than physical damage. I&#x27;ve had mild acne with my cycle for about 5 years, but this stuff I have now has been going on for about a year. I&#x27;ve called in to work, even..so embarrassed. Avoid all kinds of social events even though I&#x27;d love the experiences. Lost touch with friends because I&#x27;d always decline invites to outings, especially camping and water-involved ones because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear makeup..my ugly skin would be exposed for everyone to see. Even though makeup actually makes the attempt to cover it up seem ridiculous, it&#x27;s all I can do to sort of feel like I have normal skin... to draw attention from the ugly blemishes. These are so painful in every aspect. I mean, talking and smiling and yawning, I can feel them. Okay.. now, on to the real reason you&#x27;re still reading.. this product! Look, this is only day number two for me. Last night, I slept with it, even though it says not to, just on my jawline and upper neck where my cysts are. This morning, I took a bath and when I began drying my face, dead skin began rolling off in this area. I rubbed it all off with a towel, being careful not to be too rough and end up with raw skin. The cysts had come to surface and I was able to gently squeeze the product of infection out of my pores, one by one. Until now, I haven&#x27;t had this much success. Just new cysts every day, the old ones wouldn&#x27;t go away, but would just become less inflamed, leaving a lump that felt like somewhere deep down, there was something still in there. When I touch these &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; cysts, today, I don&#x27;t feel that slight sensitivity like there&#x27;s still some sort of infection. The newer cysts are far less inflamed, coming to the surface, obviously drying up. I got so excited about rolling off all of that dead skin, I put it all over my face and have had it on for about 2 hours, now. It doesn&#x27;t burn at all. The smell isn&#x27;t an issue. The texture is exactly how it sounds... like an ointment. Think Neosporin or A+D ointment. I slathered a little coconut oil on my skin last night before applying this stuff. I&#x27;m going to do the same tonight. I went ahead and ordered this exfoliating mitt on Amazon, today so that I can stay on top of the &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; process. I just haven&#x27;t seen such rapid, non-harsh effects from any product or procedure I&#x27;ve ever tried. The redness on my jawline and neck has gone down sooo much in just one day. The throbbing of my cysts has been greatly reduced. I know it&#x27;s so soon in my treatment with this ointment, but I&#x27;m so confident that the results will just keep getting better and better. I might even go to the beach this summer.. and let my face get wet. I look forward to the day I can sleep an extra 2 hours more before waking up to get ready for work because I don&#x27;t have to do my makeup. I&#x27;m definitely getting carried away here.. it&#x27;s all because of the high level of excitement I&#x27;m currently experiencing. You have my word.. I will be updating on this review whether or not any more success comes out of it. Thanks for reading all of my story. I know that almost all of you who have read this much probably feel very similar about your acne suffering. It&#x27;s so cruel, we spend so much money, experience so much disappointment, put ourselves through hell, and in the end.. have gotten nowhere. I&#x27;m so sick of it. If this cheap bottle of sulfur ends up being the answer to &amp;#34;what can I do to make this stop?&amp;#34;.. I&#x27;m going to be so... I can&#x27;t even think of a word to accurately describe the amount of joy, relief, freedom it will bring to my life and I&#x27;ll spread the word as much as I can. This is a good place to start ;) best wishes to you all!es to you all!</li>
    <li> It works well... found it to be very different from a leave on product but does exactly what it says &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This did not seem to help my back acne. I used it 1 to 2 times daily as directed. It smells rather unpleasant, like a blown out match, which I guess is to be expected. But after 3 weeks of regular use I did not notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I have bad acne and this stuff works for me. Been using it for over a year now, it&#x27;s really great!</li>
    <li> Has completely got rid of my acne!</li>
    <li> Finally an over the counter pruduct that fights cystic acne! I have been fighting cystic acne since I was a teenager and this product is the only product that has proven to help these aggressive cysts to be completely gone in 1 - 2 days (vs 3 - 4 weeks!). Highly recommend for all ages.</li>
    <li> Very good product and it does what suppose to do. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good product, I usually extract the pimple then apply this over night, wake up with it gone</li>
    <li> I really did not expect this to work as well as it does.  Breakouts and blackheads vanish overnight.  For me, it will replace a myriad of skin-clearing products that cost a lot more.</li>
    <li> Quite remarkable stuff - it does exactly what it says it does! I have had patches of cystic acne for literally years and this cleared it up in a couple of applications without drying out or irritating my surrounding skin.</li>
    <li> I only use this at night before bed because it&#x27;s greasy. My face feels and looks oily after application. However, I think it&#x27;s extremely effective at clearing my pimples without drying my skin.</li>
    <li> Too oily for my skin. I am used to sulphur masks and this one really disappointed me because it leaves the face very oily.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my son&#x27;s pimples. I live it overnight and in the morning almost all are gone.</li>
    <li> Amazing product to help with cystic acne.  It has a thick consistency, and it does not smell of sulfur.</li>
    <li> didnt really work all that great , only shrunk them a tiny bit for me but everyone&#x27;s different</li>
    <li> This is insane! I see so many products that have great reviews and I&#x27;ve tried them all... With absolutely NO results. So naturally I expected the same from this product. It was so cheap so I figured that I would give it a try because I am so desperate. Just as so many of the reviews said, this stuff is magic! I&#x27;ve had the same cystic pimple for over 2 months! In one night after using this product it shrank to half the size. The next night I used it as a directed and then used it as a spot treatment over night. By morning, the pimple was dried up and flat. My acne has almost disappeared in the 4 days I&#x27;ve been using it. I have not found the other product it says to use with it... I can&#x27;t imagine how well it would work with both products. I want to stock pile it in case they ever stop making it lol. There are no words to give this product the credit it deserves.</li>
    <li> DIdn&#x27;t really do much for me. I don&#x27;t see why people make a fuss about the texture. I think it works for certain skin types. It barely helped make my acne smaller but i don&#x27;t know it was an okay buy.</li>
    <li> Super quick, I use it every day and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Yes sulfur smells and yes the smell does linger this product does work well you just have to be consistent to see results I am not consistent I want something that will work fast</li>
    <li> I apply Sulfur once daily. After a short time, my 2 cysts have improved significantly. I recommend Sulfur because it is easy to use and effective as an acne medication.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this because it has pretty good reviews.  I have tried many different products at this point and while I&#x27;m not sold that this is the best one, it is a very good one. Will continue to use</li>
    <li> I have had minor acne on and off throughout my life, but have still always received comments on how &#x27;healthy&#x27; I look and how my skin glows.  Well, NO LONGER!!! In the last few months my acne has gotten OUT OF CONTROL due to some health issues.  This means, tragically, that despite eating a perfect paleo diet (no sugar, no dairy, tons of green juice etc taking top-of-the-line supplements) I am experiencing *crazy* skin eruptions.  This level of acne is new for me and so incredibly depressing!  I&#x27;m not a superficial person, and I know my value has nothing to do with how I look, but STILL- acne is NOT an enjoyable experience.  I had tried a ton of different things, clay masks, natural acne face washes and creams, homeopathic remedies, nothing was working AT ALL.  I finally broke down and went on a real search when my acne reached the point of becoming cystic, putting make-up on it actually made it look WORSE!!!  My face looks like a mountainess terrain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on reviews, I bought this as well as the Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion and have been alternating using the two.  All I can say is, THANK GOD!!!! THANK GOD!!!!  Within a day there was a significant reduction in my acne and now, a week later, it is almost completely gone and I can put on minimal cover-up (to cover the red left behind, now have to deal with that, but I&#x27;ll take it!) and feel like myself again.  Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Beats all other sulfer products I&#x27;ve tried. The ointment makes it less drying than the products that are sulfur settled in alcohol.  Really helps treat simple pimples and whiteheads. But also helps calm cystic acne!! Won&#x27;t get rid of it immediately, but it does keep it in check.</li>
    <li> Did not work for body acne but may work for other things, or skin issues .</li>
    <li> The smell is really not an issue. It works quickly so even if it did stink, who cares? It&#x27;s great if cystic acne. I used just a tiny bit and left it on all night. I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great product and it doesn&#x27;t smell. Already starting to work.</li>
    <li> 4 star for delivered before the expected date... I started using it last night... my skin feels dried and tightened... i am really desperate of my zits... once the old zits dries another couple of 2 zits breaks out... i hope this will work for me as i had read all the positive reviews... i will be posting any developments after a week... so cross fingers...</li>
    <li> Works well. Stinks, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> This sulfur acne cream works well for me and its cheap. I only use it once a day usually. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like this stuff. It didn&#x27;t help me to much. Didn&#x27;t like the feeling on my skin</li>
    <li> I decided to try this because the Sulphur lotion from my Dr is very expensive. It&#x27;s not prescription strength, but it works very well. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> way to greasy didnt work for me</li>
    <li> I had a really bad break out on the left side of my face. So bad i did not want to go out of my house, or even talk to anyone in the house.  (KIDS/HUSBAND). I had about 9 big inflamed cyctic acne bumbs. My left cheek was puffy and hot. It was horrible and painful. I bought this out of desperation. The reviews were hit an miss. I looked on youtube for some reviews they were okay too. I paid for one day shipping i needed it asap. When it came i used it that night for about 30 mins. When i washed it off the swelling and hotness was almost all gone. The bumps went a little down.  The next morning the swelling and hot feeling was gone. The acne was half the size it was. It only took 3 days for all of them to be gone. They usually stay for a week before they even begin to think about going down. I have used this every other night and no new bumbs. I am so happy with this product. I just wish I found this a few years ago.  I struggled with acne for a long time, since I was 15 I am 29 now and the past few years iv been dealing with cyctic acne/hormonal acne. I have tried every over the counter,  a few prescription meds and some diy home remedies. Nothing worked for me. Not salycid acid or benzoyl peroxide. I did find a cetiphil foam wash that helped a little but nothing dramatic.  Sorry it&#x27;s so long just wanted to tell my story because I know I&#x27;m not the only person dealing with this. If you are and nothing else worked try this! It&#x27;s so cheap. Works so well and it will last for a long time. I will say I left it on too long on my chin and it peeled really bad but only for one day. I put coconut oil on the peeled part and it was healed in a day.</li>
    <li> I broke out even worse than before with this product. If you have sensitive skin as i do, then this product is not the best option for you.</li>
    <li> Im using for scabies, saves thousands , pure , and works,love it,, I have and am using the ten percent scrubbing or exfoliating or waiting it the tub,, washing those terrible no see ums down the drains, and feeling better with each useage,, love this product and believe me, have been trying alot, even the non effective poisons,, thanks,, :)</li>
    <li> Wow!  Improvement is more than expected.  Great product for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Kind of works, I think? I can&#x27;t really tell. I have moderate cysytic acne and combination skin. I have been using regularly but it doesn&#x27;t help much. I much prefer my Jasons natural tea tree mineral gel. It&#x27;s for muscle pain but it works well to stop the progession of cysts if I can dab some on it in time.</li>
    <li> I have had acne since having children for over half a decade now and this is the ONLY thing that has stopped it literally! Love it!</li>
    <li> I used this product as a mask for about a week or two, every day for ten minutes before rinsing.  It did seem to be helping, but my problem was the smell.  Another reviewer mentioned it having a &amp;#34;fresh, clean smell&amp;#34;.  Well, I&#x27;d love to know what products you use to clean, because this does NOT smell good or fresh. It smells like sulfur.  Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing and washing my face, sometimes even twice to try and get rid of the smell, I&#x27;d go around to my family asking if they could smell it on me.  The weird thing is that although I could smell it everywhere, nonstop, no one else could smell it.  I assume that it&#x27;s because it was actually ON my face, right next to my nose, that I could smell it until my next shower. Which isn&#x27;t too bad, but it does become annoying after awhile. I actually had to stop using it because the smell got to me so badly, even just using it as a spot treatment instead of a mask.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again. It didn&#x27;t make enough of an impact on my skin to warrant me repurchasing and dealing with the odor.</li>
    <li> Only have used a couple of times, but it does make a difference in the size of the pimple. Smells kinda bad though.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I had been thinking about buying it for a while, but i was sick of being disappointed by acne products promising me the moon, but I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. I have PCOS and acne is one of the side effects of it.  My acne is so stubborn! It was getting so bad that I was waking up with 3-5 new cysts everyday. Once one or two of my cysts would start heal a bunch would spring up to replace the ones that were barely starting to reduce in size. Anyway, when this arrived I used it as a spot treatment and the next day I was stunned! I was not expecting it to do much of anything for my cysts, because none of the other sulfur products that I have tried did anything. But thankfully this product did was it said would do and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My face is the smoothest it has been in years. I mean i still get breakouts and all, but I just dab this on them and they really really reduce in size by the next and around the 2nd or 3rd day they&#x27;ll be gone. This is the best thing I have found to control the acne from the PCOS, so I am sticking with it.</li>
    <li> So happy with this product. I have really oily skin that breaks out out often.  Before this product,  waking up with a new pimple everyday was normal. This product dries out blemishes in 1 to 2 days. Within the 1st week I saw great results. Now I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks and I couldn&#x27;t be happier w the progress. I still get my occasional breakouts but that is mostly due to hormonal changes and the hot florida weather. Other than that, I&#x27;ve tried the traditional OTC products (benzoyl peroxide 10% and salicilyc acid) and none of them do absolutely anything for my skin. Sulfur treatment is what works for me bc its dries out my pores. I am pretty sure my acne stems from having oily skin, which in turns clogs my pores when I wear makeup. The smell is strong but worth it bc the results are incredible.  Buy buy buy!</li>
    <li> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!! THIS PRODUCTIS NOT WORKING.. ITS JUST LIKE A PASTE.. IT NEVER WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work any better than the countless other remedies I&#x27;ve tried.  Is messy to use.</li>
    <li> love how it makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> It was like putting industrial waste on my face. It is called &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34;, but it is just a thick SLIME, and left my face a greasy ravaged MESS. Gave it a few tries anyway like an IDEOT, WHAT a disaster and WHAT a HORRENDOUS product! It is cheap and disgusting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only writing this review to warn other African Americans or darker descendants that this product is not for you. It burnt my skin and left it very dark and hyper pigmented. I&#x27;m hoping my skin will return to normal one day.</li>
    <li> This really works for me.  I get hormonal acne as well as acne from allergens, particularly in late spring and fall.  I use at least once a day just on the affected areas.  I often leave it on for longer than the 10 minutes, but have found leaving it on longer is not necessarily better.  Using it more than once a day for the recommended amount of time seems to have a better effect.  I never sleep with it on as it feels greasy when you apply it.  Don&#x27;t let the greasy feel deter you, it is an ointment after all, but having said that it washes off without soap and has a wonderful clean scent.  I apply my moisturizer and make-up right after I wash off the sulfur with water only.  Depending on your acne, you will need to be patient.  This is not an overnight fix, although you will see your skin improve on a daily basis.  It has particularly helped me with problem spots that just won&#x27;t heal.  I have been using for a month and a half now and have far fewer break-outs and the lumps that just wouldn&#x27;t go away are greatly reduced.  I will buy this again.  I should note that I do use other acne products, mainly the AcneFree toner and lotion and on occasion a chemical peel, but it is the sulfur ointment that has worked the best.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick ointment, but I feel a difference as soon as I put it on my face. I only keep it on for about 10-30 minutes then rinse. It does have a tendency to dry your skin out as it works to clear it up. It does have a strong sulfur smell.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Not to crazy about the smell.</li>
    <li> Time will tell. Slightly stinky of course with the Sulphur so be prepared. I have Lupus and have developed skin rashes and cysts that turn into blisters after a while. This is one of many products I&#x27;ve tried. Used in moderation, it does dry up pimples, but it is very drying on surrounding skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a single thing except smell bad and get everywhere cause its so tacky</li>
    <li> Just got it yesterday.  Full review later</li>
    <li> Wow, this actually worked. I had a small cyst on my stomach and surprisingly, this ointment got rid of it in a relatively short time. If you have a cyst, I recommend it</li>
    <li> Good Acne Ointment~~~</li>
    <li> My skin is looking good</li>
    <li> I have a good amount of acne. Dried them up quickly. I noticed an improvement just after 2 uses. And it hardly even smells. Just put some on your trouble spots not your entire face. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Simply the best! Tried me all, but this works like magic!</li>
    <li> First off, the package came open - not sealed. Will no use.&lt;br /&gt;Incredibly slow shipping as well. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> I use it in the morning,  to get extra dirt out of my skin.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says is what it is. Its not one of those sulfer lotions its more of a sulfer ointment as advertised. Wish they offered bigger jars instead of 2.6 oz ones</li>
    <li> I have used everything from Proactive to Retin-A. This is by far the best thing I have found. I can&#x27;t even explain how awesome this works. I have super oily skin. This manages my breakouts, reduces swelling and just overall makes my skin look amazing. I struggled for so long until I took a chance on this product. I leave it on overnight with no issues. Also a little goes a long way!!! I hate that other acne products come in such small containers. This will last me forever!</li>
    <li> Clears acne bumps and cysts. I&#x27;ll never be without it in my medicine  cabinet. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! I noticed reduced size in my cyst after first use! After 2nd use it was gone... thank you!!!! Btw its cheaper at walmart guys!</li>
    <li> This stuff works for those zits that are too deep to &amp;#34;pop.&amp;#34;  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Smells bad, I ended up throwing it in the garbage can.</li>
    <li> Very greasy. It does seem to work, but is so unpleasant to apply that Im not buying it again.</li>
    <li> Working Fine - Arrived on time</li>
    <li> Made me break out even more and cause inflammation of tissue. Is this product even safe? I don&#x27;t think so. Threw it away after the 2nd week. Awful.</li>
    <li> Dries up the pimple, and it just falls off, no need to pop it or worry about scars. I rub a little all over my face 5 min before shower be exfoliating and has def helped alot.</li>
    <li> Did not help at all with cysts.. I would not recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> Got this a week ago got to say it did help with my acne went away in like 4 days but i left it on for like 12 hours in 1 day my acne was gone best thing i tried so give it a try but like i said leave it on aleast a couple of hours</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it as a full face mask when my acne gets really bad and as a spot treatment for everyday. I leave it on overnight even though it says to wipe off after 10 min. Seriously love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This thing actually works. Oh How long have I been searching for something that would relieve me of my acne. Thank God I found this. Love it. 😊</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been on this for a couple of weeks, but I&#x27;ve already had good results. Thanks for a good product.</li>
    <li> Too much like an ointment. Wished it was a drying texture</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this both on blemishes and even a burn on my finger and this product really works. I will warn you that it is really drying, so use extra moisturizer and exfoliate.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and use a prescription sulfur lotion for prevention. But it&#x27;s expensive. I tried this, hoping for a cheaper alternative, but the cream itself is too thick for me. I couldn&#x27;t tell any improvement and went back to using the thin Klaron lotion instead. But it didn&#x27;t make my acne worse, so it might work for others. The smell is off-putting but not horrible. I won&#x27;t be reordering but don&#x27;t regret giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I was looking for skin tightening creams, actually,and bumped into this on my suggestions page because I purchased it a few months back. I&#x27;ve recently begun to wonder if Amazon&#x27;s ratings aren&#x27;t completely fake (:() and so I decided to post a review of this because it really works well for me after so many other things haven&#x27;t. I put it on a blemish after washing my face before bed. It&#x27;s pretty gross stuff, by the look and feel of it and the smell isn&#x27;t pleasant either (that&#x27;s why it loses one star), but come morning, even the honking-est pimple cannot bear up. It gets rid of redness, will noticeably reduce size and takes out any soreness.  This isn&#x27;t a fake review, if you&#x27;re wondering and if you have any authentic skin tightening recommendations, I&#x27;m all ears--or eyes, as the case may be.</li>
    <li> Wasted my money! Didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> To be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m somewhere between a 3 1/2 to a 4 star on this product. The reason being that it depends entirely on the type of acne you have. Many reviews mentioned it fixing cystic acne, which I have, but not all acne is created equal. From my understanding, many reviewers are suffering from either oily or hormonal skin that the sulphur ointment works well on. Mine is unfortunately caused by food--most especially sugar. I have been using this for a little over a week and my results are a little sub par. Certainly it reduced some redness, pain, and did reduce the size somewhat faster than I have experienced in the past, but I still have the heavy bumps under my skin and none of my spots I started with during my treatment have really gone away. I will continue to use it for awhile, though, while changing my diet to see if it makes more of a change or not.&lt;br /&gt;As for how I used it, at night I wash off my makeup and applied it in heavy globs on my face and let it sit for at least an hour (first night I only did 20 minutes tops in case I had a bad reaction. Test it as you see fit to your skin type, but it seems to work a little better if you do let it sit longer). Wash it off with a regular face wash and applied lotion so it won&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is a little strong the first use, but I no longer notice it. It is tacky, I would not recommend keeping it on overnight unless you sleep on a towel or something.</li>
    <li> My daughter suffered for years with cysts on her face, inside her ears, on her back, that just break out in the same places over&amp; over again. We have tried, lots of medications and prescriptions and creams but nothing has worked until this product. It dries them out and works over a few days time without the usual trauma to her skin. The whole family is grabbing this cream to use on acne spots. It&#x27;s made a hugh difference in my daughter&#x27;s skin. She is so happy to have finally found something that works. It&#x27;s worth a shot to see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> TERRIFIC!!! This works great!!!</li>
    <li> I just had a baby and my skin went into hyper acne mode. I decided to take a chance on this. I am so happy I did. U put it on affected area leave on for ten minutes then wipe off with warm cloth. Unbelievably the next day my acne cleared up!!!What ??? Now I use every night on my nose blackheads and my t zone oh cant forget under my cheak bones too. My face is clear. I am so impressed. I have tried everything and the only thing that ever helped was retin a. Well retina makes you break out first then clears. I cant hide for two weeks. This is amazing!!! I highly recommend this product. I will be buying again and again. I love it!! Buyer beware its a little stinky...it is sulfer after all but if u have tried everything on the market stop and try this. My acne is stubborn too. Not even proactive worked for me!! This does the job. I can stand the mild sulfer smell for 10 minutes a day for clear skin. Thank you De La Cruz. I am now putting on my make up on beautiful clear smooth skin. Gotta take newborn to pediatrician. Off I go!!!</li>
    <li> For the most part, this ointment zaps a bump fairly quickly.  Shrinks bump and smooths it away.</li>
    <li> I went against the instructions and left the cream on overnight on a huge post pregnancy zit that I had.  In the morning the pimple was almost 100% gone.</li>
    <li> They seriously need to change the picture for this product, but on to the real review. I have used it for a few days so far and it worked well for a few breakouts. I will have to wait a bit more for a full review.</li>
    <li> UPDATE::  When I first used this product I did like some other reviews did and left it on overnight to speed up the process.  That worked, and it really dried out my pimples,  BUT, if you don&#x27;t stay on top of your moisturizing game, you will definitely suffer the consequences...I had a really bad breakout on the upper bridge of my nose and slathered this stuff on overnight for like 2 or 3 nights in a row, and lordy...the dried skin made it look worse once this stuff kicked in.  I learned my lesson for sure.  So now when I use it, I use it at night, but I wipe it off with a cloth after like 2 or 3 hours.  I find this works best on the more cystic type of acne, but if you put a tiny bit on a whitehead and wipe it off after a few hours, it shrinks them up a little and dries them out.  Derm prescribed me azelaic cream because I needed something safe I could take while trying to get pregnant, but it made things much worse!  So I stopped using it.  Overall, Ill continue with this product, as it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s really working for me at the moment...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I just received my sulfur ointment.  I excitedly washed my face and dabbed this on all my active pimples. Ever since I got off birth control my hormonal acne has just gotten worse and worse by the day. I thought I was past acne, as I&#x27;m 34! Not so I guess...once an acne sufferer, always an acne sufferer I guess. As a teenager into my 20s I suffered from cystic acne and regular whitehead pimples. Usually around my jawline and upper neck/ right under my chin area, also around my hairline by my ears and sometimes cheeks. The only place clear at the moment is my forehead and cheeks! :(&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m leaving this spot treatment on until we go out later on tonight. So probably like 4 hours. I will definitely update my review once I&#x27;ve given this product time to work.</li>
    <li> Jan 2017 Update: After 3 years of weekly use, we got used to the clear skin and stopped applying this for several weeks. Cystic type pimples came back. So learned all over again to keep some of this around and to apply at least once a week in susceptible spots. PRIOR UPDATE: My husband no longer gets cystic pimples if we apply this to his back every few days. If we go too long, he gets one or two bad bumps again (usually when in pain or under stress). But applying this cream promptly to each outbreak kills it. And his skin has no scarring. Can&#x27;t believe this decade-old problem was solved so easily. We wasted so much on doctors and prescriptions. ORIGINAL REVIEW: We are amazed at how effective this is for recalcitrant acne. Although Proactive usually has been great, it did not cure back acne. This is making the skin look better every hour. My husband wears a tee-shirt to bed after applying because it is tacky and could leave spots on the sheets. (Although the teeshirts have washed out without stains from this.) UPDATE: After less than 3 weeks,my husband has had very few new pimples or boils -- he had two new ones start and they closed up quickly with this ointment. Everything is healing and it looks like there may be no scarring. After 3 years of trying prescriptions and ointments, we cannot believe it is this easy and cheap to fix the problem.</li>
    <li> Suffer from pcos and have had horrible acne for several years now. I have tried everything and anything with no results.  After just a few days of using this I&#x27;m in love. Not 100% results but around 85% which is much more than other products. I put a thin layer on and sleep with it.  Amazing.  Now I just need something to help with my super oily skin,  ance marks,  and humongous pores...</li>
    <li> My face and back are recovering from mild cystic acne. My acne ranges from an ordinary spot breakout, to patches on my cheeks/chin where I have countless white cysts which never come to a head. They grow beneath my skin and become painful, eventually becoming so large that they just must be lanced. After lancing, the area is inflamed and sore; this is when the area is most likely to get infected. The same cysts would continuously regrow in the same spot, becoming larger more quickly after the initial trauma to the skin, and always more susceptible to infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the very first treatment, the cysts felt less inflamed. When I washed away the ointment and felt my skin, the bumps were less like braille and more like...skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That evening, before bed, I applied some of the ointment as a spot treatment. The next morning, the bumps had reduced considerably in size. Throughout the day they did become larger, and throughout the next; I ended up having to lance them, and immediately after I treated the area with a generous slathering of the sulfur ointment for twenty minutes. The area never became infected, and today (three days after lancing/with sulfur) the spots are smooth and healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sulfur treatment is the only product to have this effect on my skin. Peroxide as well as salicylic acid products dried it out and helped prevent new blemishes, though did nothing for the cysts. Tea tree helped the inflammation in the cysts reduce, but it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough. With the sulfur, I saw results right away. It is drying, of course, though with adequate moisturizing (I use pure olive oil on my face and body, the only thing which doesn&#x27;t break my skin out) it&#x27;s not an issue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: This stuff worked when nothing else did. It smells minimally like sulfur, is goopy and greasy, and it totally worked for me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best value--the price is right, and it worked overnight to clear my skin&#x27;s acne!</li>
    <li> Finally something that works! I&#x27;ve had these pimple like bumps on my scalp for a long long time and I&#x27;ve been using different ointments, shampoos, they did ok but when I applied this on the affected area the bumps disappeared almost overnight! I apply once daily.</li>
    <li> I got this because I get a big pimple once a month somewhere along the jaw line and I wanted a way to spot treat the pimple so it&#x27;ll go away faster. This product is an ointment so it has that petroleum ointment texture. That being the case it does feel greasy and the idea of putting something greasy on a pimple troubled me. Also this won&#x27;t work under makeup. After trying out various pimple spot products I&#x27;ve found what works best for me is a 10% sulphur mask that I would use at night and wash off, and a sulphur based coverup to use during the day under makeup.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t put into words how much this product changed my life. I got crazy cystic acne out of no where, I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like it in my life, I&#x27;m in my 20s, and I literally tried everything to avoid being the &amp;#34;girl with acne&amp;#34; and this stuff works like a miracle! I&#x27;ve spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars and this 10 bucks was the best I&#x27;ve ever spent. People don&#x27;t understand the emotional journey acne takes you through and how it changes your entire life. Please if your suffering from acne and it makes you look at yourself differently, PLEASE BUY THIS. I will never buy another acne product again! I only wish I found this sooner!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could rate this less than 5 stars. I use this with African black soap and shea butter for a moisturizer. I have learned that this is the key ingredient in my routine. I take a small amount and put a thin layer over the moisturizer. This worked when absolutely nothing else did! My mom was so shocked to see my skin. It fades the pimples and dark spots while clearing the acne. There is no way I can ever go without this product!</li>
    <li> Works quickly.  I&#x27;m amazed.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this product at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent, I  use this daily and  starting to clear  my  acne!</li>
    <li> Used this product for over a month. Only difference I saw was that it reduced the redness on my face. It did increase the amount of blackheads on my cheeks and nose. Would not use again.</li>
    <li> Stinks but works great</li>
    <li> This stuff was just okay.. It definitely dries your skin out and stinks while doing it.. but any big difference in my skin? Not really.. Definitely sitting on my shelves now. Don&#x27;t waste your time &amp; money.</li>
    <li> I have used this for only a couple of weeks. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! It says to leave on and then rinse with water DO IT! You do not want to burn or irritate your skin. I have not had any issues with reddness or irritation. After the first use it tightened my skin and dried up the black heads. Wonderful product I wish I would have known about sulfer for acne sooner.</li>
    <li> I feel bad writing this review because I think the product could work, but I had an issue with the smell. So the smell is not so strong when you put it on, but then it leaves that sulfur smell in your skin for a long time. I could not keep using the product because of the smell.</li>
    <li> Works great!  My skin looks more clear in just one or two days. Only bad thing is the terrible smell.</li>
    <li> I had a cream similar to this that was prescribed by a doctor for my Rosacea. After it ran out I got a couple new prescriptions but something in the formula was different and it never worked for my skin issues again. This stuff is what I have been searching for, for well over a year. It doesn&#x27;t say Rosacea treatment in the description but it totally works for calming down my flare ups. Did it make it go away 100%? No. But 90% reduction is well worth the price of admission here. Also eliminated all pimples and zits that tagged along with my Rosacea flare ups as well. I just apply it at night before bed to get the flare ups under control then maybe once every couple days.</li>
    <li> Great product! It helps with cystic acne. I use it as a mask once a day all over face for 15-20 minutes and at night as a spot treatment a very very thin layer. I am allergic to benzol peroxide, so to me it&#x27;s a great alternative. Definitely purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> I literally read every review on this product and was really hopeful that it would work for me....here are my thoughts...for one it didn&#x27;t smell at all...some people mentioned an overwhelming sulfur smell...while I did smell the sulfur it was NOT over powering in my opinion...&lt;br /&gt;I have recently started suffering from adult acne per my dermatologist...he injected cortisone in my large cyst like pimples and within a day they were significantly smaller in size...I used this product as a mask... I left in on longer than ten minutes and prior to using it as a mask I used it as a spot treatment over night on the larger pimples I had...Some reviewers reported that overnight the pimple was gone...unfortunately for me that was not the case... they didn&#x27;t decrease in size at all...Two things I didn&#x27;t like about the product is that it is very tacky like some reviewers reported...and because of that it didn&#x27;t stay on my face overnight... I don&#x27;t know if I should continue to use the product when I haven&#x27;t seen results...I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different...maybe it&#x27;s a time sensitive product and it gradually will work...I&#x27;ll stick with a little longer...</li>
    <li> It really cleared up the light discoloration my daughter had on her face.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for a small open sore on the back of my neck</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works!  From what I am understanding about acne - different people will have different types and products will not work for all folks.  But, I have had acne for over 20 years (I am 41) and have tried so many different products.  This is the first time I have had a product that actually works for me.  I get large cysts and smaller &amp;#34;under skin&amp;#34; types of acne and this takes care of both.  I put a little on at night after washing my face and leave it on all night.  I will also put some on in the morning after washing too.  It does have a sulfur odor but I have had no one say anything and I have asked friends and family to let me know if it smells and they all say they can&#x27;t smell it - even though I can when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I would recommend trying it - it does work if it is right for you.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of pimples in 1 night. I had a zit trying to come out on my nose. And I applied this on and the next day it was gone! Amazing stuff works.</li>
    <li> Item was as described</li>
    <li> If you have cystic acne (the kind that just sits under the skin, hard and sore, and never really comes to a head) this stuff helps a lot. I have used it a couple of times, and just last week, had one trying to come on my chin. Used this for three days before bed, just dabbing on area where zit is trying to come, and by day 2, it was gone. The only downside is, it is extremely drying to the skin since it is a higher strength. I am now dealing with that area of my chin dry and flaking/peeling for the last couple days, in combination with the dry, cold air outside. The directions state not to leave on the skin for over, I believe 10 minutes, but it can be used for spot-treating overnight if your skin is not too sensitive.</li>
    <li> sadly it didn&#x27;t help my face &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Yes this has worked for me..i actually leave it on my face for a hour to get max benefit then I rinse off..Drys skin so I use it at night then I sleep and in the morning I use my daytime tzone face wash and moisture with  aloe Vera.....my main problem was those big cysts around my chin area, no longer do I get them since I been using this ointment!!..still get the odd spots but no more *cysts*..normal spots I can deal with as they go but it was cysts I couldn&#x27;t deal with and so glad this sulphur has worked!..ordering more it&#x27;s on its way!</li>
