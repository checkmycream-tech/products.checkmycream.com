      <li>This seems like it gives good coverage</li>
      <li>I recommend that you apply a good primer on your face before applying the BB Cream.</li>
      <li>but this is an amazing product and good for your skin.</li>
      <li>maybe the \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; colors are better but unless you&#x27;ve tried this out before and had a good experience</li>
      <li>This item gives great coverage and allows for quick application.  </li>
      <li>I would consider my skin tone to be light to medium olive and this shade was  good for me though a bit too orangey.</li>
      <li>This is beautiful when first applied.  </li>
      <li>It looks great when you first apply it.</li>
      <li>With BB creams like this, you get very light coverage which makes your skin look more</li>
      <li>This Garnier is just ok because it doesn&#x27;t provide all day coverage.  </li>
      <li>If anything, it puts more moisture into my skin.</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>I just love it .</li>
      <li>I love this miracle bb</li>
      <li>I love this product it does</li>
      <li>I share the same complexion as Gabrielle Union and its a perfect match.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be safe to order via amazon.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again unless they make more shades.</li>
      <li>I set it with a mineral foundation for a bit more coverage and staying power.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Also love this bb cream.</li>
      <li>Garnier&#x27;s BB Cream is a good option for those who sometimes need light application or something that just feels light on their face.</li>
      <li>I love this miracle skin bb cream</li>
      <li>It also allows for skin renewal and promotes healthy skin.</li>
      <li>While i don&#x27;t have much to hide on my face, this BB cream provides perfect coverage without having to apply much.</li>
      <li>This looked really nice when first applied.  </li>
      <li>and i have the skin color of an indian person which is fine</li>
      <li>Then I started noticing that my pores were standing out and looked HUGE.</li>
      <li>This shade is way too orange and light for my complexion.</li>
      <li>The formula is light weight and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>IT FORS NOT GIVE THE LOOK OF MAKE UP AND IS LIGHT.</li>
      <li>Its light adn non greasy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not really a dark person and the tones of this are a bit more on the warm side, if you&#x27;re darker than let&#x27;s say cinnamon or a pecan, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>so was excited to order.</li>
      <li>this is real good it clear up my spots on my face with in a few months, and i still have more</li>
      <li>True to match.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>particular cream is extremely runny as others have stated, but applies flawlessly and creates an even look.</li>
      <li>and it ended up clogging even more pores than I already have clogged in places they don&#x27;t normally get clogged like on my neck and between my eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame because it really does even skin tone and it feels light.</li>
      <li>i figured it would be the same kind of thing.</li>
      <li>Love it so far, matte finish, still testing if it controls oil production during the day though.</li>
      <li>It BLENDS IN VERY WELL to give your skin a more EVEN AND NATURAL LOOK AND FEEL.</li>
      <li>I gave the Olay away &amp; went back to the Garnier BB about 4 days ago, and my skin already looks better.</li>
      <li>Love this product and have brought it several times at Walmart and Target.</li>
      <li>If you are in need of light natural enhancement, this BB is for you.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still pretty oily by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I ordered several and I am so thrilled I have a regiment that fits by busy schedule.  </li>
      <li>I have large pores and my pores are always clogged no matter if I wear makeup or not.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>AND I WAS VERY WASTEFUL WITH IT.</li>
      <li>I immediately noticed that I missed the fast drying,</li>
      <li>It has a very orange undertone that I do not like.</li>
      <li>The formula is really liquidy and runny.</li>
      <li>and it helps keep me shine free almost the entire day.</li>
      <li>I love this bb cream, they stopped carrying the deep in stores near me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many bb/cc/ tinted moisturizer creams from those at Walmart from brands like Garnier, Covergirl, L&#x27;Oreal etc to those at Sephora like Smashbox, Clinque, Bare Minerals, Urban Decay etc, and have not found at bb cream that handles my combination skin so well nor blends so well.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, its decent and I like the fact that it has sunscreen in it.  </li>
      <li>It mattifies your face and provides decent coverage as well as providing SPF.</li>
      <li>this is a decent product for summer time.</li>
      <li>I found that the Ambi was a little too dark for my skin tone but the garnier deep is perfect.</li>
      <li>Stick with the one for normal skin</li>
      <li>The color said deep which was fine but WAS NOT DEEP!</li>
      <li>I applied it and it was no where near my shade.</li>
      <li>my skin is very oily in the summer, and this product definitely doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
      <li>natural-</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get to the post office fast enough!!!</li>
      <li>.. Waste of money, should have paid retail &amp; will know better next time.</li>
      <li>It offers light coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like some foundations.  </li>
      <li>Have used the regular one in the past and was pleased.  </li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t at all like the picture suggests and as it so cleverly says in tiny lettering it is just a \\&quot;simulation\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>like you&#x27;re not even wearing makeup (Basically it fades your dark spots/scars and evens out skin tone immediately) and there is absolutely NO cakey look like the one you&#x27;ll get with most foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my face still got very oily, and this color is not for a brown skin, African american.</li>
      <li>I searched high and low for this when I started running low a year ago.</li>
      <li>It prevents me from further breakouts and has a natural look.</li>
      <li>I have super extremely unbelievably oily skin.  </li>
      <li>i will not repurchase it because it is not effective on super oily skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Turns your skin a dark orange. I would not use again.</li>
    <li> Since im dark skinned i couldnt use this as a bb cream for my face so i use it as a concealer to brighten my undereye and it works just as well</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT A TUBE OF THIS ONE DAY WALKIN AROUND WALMART AND IMMEDIATELY NOTICED A CHANGE NOT ONLY WITH IT ON BUT WHEN I TOOK IT OFF. IT FORS NOT GIVE THE LOOK OF MAKE UP AND IS LIGHT. I AM A MECHANIC SO SWEAT IS A NO NO WHEN I AM WORKIN. I DONT WANT A SMUDGE AND I WANT IT TO LOOK GOOD ALL 12 hours. Especially in the tropics of okinawa Japan. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and doesn&#x27;t give the smile crease that we all hate. I searched high and low for this when I started running low a year ago. YES IT LASTED ME TWO YEARS AND I WAS VERY WASTEFUL WITH IT. I even had my BF SEARCH IN HIS HOMETOWN WHEN HE RETURNED TO TO THE STATES. FINALLY FOUND DEEP on AMAZON and I couldn&#x27;t get to the post office fast enough!!! As a black woman it&#x27;s hard to find shades that flatter us but this is an amazing product and good for your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product! I&#x27;m happy I could find the shade I needed.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I have very oily skin and it helps keep me shine free almost the entire day. No need to touch up during the day. The color is great too. I share the same complexion as Gabrielle Union and its a perfect match.</li>
    <li> I am a dark skin African American women and I thought this shade would be my complexion since its the only one I found that&#x27;s dark. I applied it and it was no where near my shade. Sad face, cause I really wanted this to work</li>
    <li> Excellent seller,  quick shipment! Also love this bb cream. It prevents me from further breakouts and has a natural look.</li>
    <li> Love it so far, matte finish, still testing if it controls oil production during the day though.</li>
    <li> It has a very orange undertone that I do not like. I have worn it once since I bought and haven&#x27;t used it since. I have medium dark skin tone, don&#x27;t know if its just my skin tone that it doesn&#x27;t suit but do not like this BB cream at all.</li>
    <li> my face still got very oily, and this color is not for a brown skin, African american. When I wore this is made me look pale.</li>
    <li> I have tried very expensive oil control and mattifying makeup and they don&#x27;t even compare. I love this product it does it&#x27;s job controling oil and it blends in great with my skin tone leaving it looking flawless.</li>
    <li> If you are in need of light natural enhancement, this BB is for you.  I ordered several and I am so thrilled I have a regiment that fits by busy schedule.  Over time My skin has improved.  Its light adn non greasy.  I no longer wear heavy make up.</li>
    <li> Love this product and have brought it several times at Walmart and Target. I thought it would be safe to order via amazon. However, I was disappointed with the quality of the product. The coloring was orange and it was basically water with no texture to it. I was also bummed that I spent money on a product that could not be returned. Overall, I will stick to buying &amp;#34;in-store&amp;#34; where I know if I get a bad product, I can return it. This order was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> True to match.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!!</li>
    <li> This item gives great coverage and allows for quick application.  It also allows for skin renewal and promotes healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I love this miracle skin bb cream😊😉😁</li>
    <li> Garnier&#x27;s BB Cream is a good option for those who sometimes need light application or something that just feels light on their face. Mine is deep even though I am Caramel Complexion. If you are using the Garnier Clinical Correction program, the BB Cream will be your best friend throughout the skin correction process. It BLENDS IN VERY WELL to give your skin a more EVEN AND NATURAL LOOK AND FEEL. The formula is light weight and non-greasy. If you sweat from long hours at work and have oily skin, this Ladies-or gents is something you have to try! I recommend that you apply a good primer on your face before applying the BB Cream. I probably should use with translucent power because my nose tends to shine after a while.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful when first applied.  I have super extremely unbelievably oily skin.  I have large pores and my pores are always clogged no matter if I wear makeup or not. This looked really nice when first applied.  I set it with a mineral foundation for a bit more coverage and staying power. 4 hours later my skin was an oily mess worse than usual.  I tried it for a week and it ended up clogging even more pores than I already have clogged in places they don&#x27;t normally get clogged like on my neck and between my eyes. It&#x27;s a shame because it really does even skin tone and it feels light. I would consider my skin tone to be light to medium olive and this shade was  good for me though a bit too orangey.</li>
    <li> Great seller great product</li>
    <li> This product is great. I&#x27;m a caramel skinned African American woman and this blends well with my complexion. Although if you are darker skinned I would recommend the Ambi cc cream for dark skin instead. I found that the Ambi was a little too dark for my skin tone but the garnier deep is perfect. I always get compliments on my complexion when I wear it. It offers light coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like some foundations.  My only complaint is that it does not really keep me from getting oily. I&#x27;m still pretty oily by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Wow, was I wrong! Seen in retail stores &amp; wanted to try but quite expensive.. Then saw here at a great price so was excited to order. OMGosh .. The color said deep which was fine but WAS NOT DEEP! It&#x27;s ORANGE!! Like a really bad fake tan.. Waste of money, should have paid retail &amp; will know better next time.</li>
    <li> I had been using this for about 6 months and was running low- always looking for a bargain, I used a coupon to buy a tinted Olay CC cream- i figured it would be the same kind of thing. I immediately noticed that I missed the fast drying, matte finish the Garnier gives me. But I kept using the Olay for about a week.  Then I started noticing that my pores were standing out and looked HUGE. I gave the Olay away &amp; went back to the Garnier BB about 4 days ago, and my skin already looks better. I&#x27;m truly devoted now!</li>
    <li> The color is off, seemed kinda orange on me.  I was also disappointed when I received the package, when I opened the tube it seemed as though someone had opened it before and it split all over the top of the cap. ugh...</li>
    <li> The oil is still there. I don&#x27;t see a matte finish when I&#x27;m done. But I&#x27;ve only used it about 2 weeks .</li>
    <li> While i don&#x27;t have much to hide on my face, this BB cream provides perfect coverage without having to apply much. I get lots of compliments. Also helps with shine, which is one of my biggest issues.</li>
    <li> I use this in place of foundation and always get compliments on my skin. It smooths and brightens for a flawless look</li>
    <li> Have used the regular one in the past and was pleased.  Since I have oily skin I wanted to get the one for my skin type.  It is so thin and runny that it as soon as you take the cap off it starts pouring out all over everything.  Stick with the one for normal skin</li>
    <li> Works great on skin of color</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream, they stopped carrying the deep in stores near me so I had to track it online. But it&#x27;s great it has a nice matte finish, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and is gr w at for my oily skin. Not to mention people always compliment me on my complexion. I always tell them it&#x27;s out of a bottle, well I guess in this case a tube. I&#x27;m not really a dark person and the tones of this are a bit more on the warm side, if you&#x27;re darker than let&#x27;s say cinnamon or a pecan, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> i got this bb cream from walmart. this bb cream claims to control shine and control oil production but i did not experience any of that. after using this bb cream, my face become shinny in a hour or two. has SPF of 20 and provides very sheer coverage. i will not repurchase it because it is not effective on super oily skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I love this miracle bb</li>
    <li> this is real good it clear up my spots on my face with in a few months, and i still have more</li>
    <li> This is my go to bb cream I just love it . This bb cream dont onley work as a conceler, foundation but also is good on your skin . It goes on light and Smoot and will make your skin flawless and beautiful. I have been using this bb cream for 2 years and I love it you defiantly will find this bb cream in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I found this BB cream when trying out a friend&#x27;s bottle when I couldn&#x27;t find my foundation- long story short, I&#x27;ll never use another foundation ever in my life! With BB creams like this, you get very light coverage which makes your skin look more natural- like you&#x27;re not even wearing makeup (Basically it fades your dark spots/scars and evens out skin tone immediately) and there is absolutely NO cakey look like the one you&#x27;ll get with most foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular cream is extremely runny as others have stated, but applies flawlessly and creates an even look. It has an orange undertone, which I realize now that my face requires in makeup, so if you have pink or neutral undertones, the Deep color may not work for you. My skin is a caramel color and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t understand is the fact that this is advertised for oily skin- my skin is very oily in the summer, and this product definitely doesn&#x27;t help. If anything, it puts more moisture into my skin. However, it  isn&#x27;t oily and doesn&#x27;t worsen anything, so as long as I use my Ben Nye Powder (I find Sienna to match this color best) I don&#x27;t have any serious problems.</li>
    <li> I purchased this is the shade deep hoping that it would at least blend in with my complexion. This shade is way too orange and light for my complexion. The formula is really liquidy and runny. It blends alright - if you can find a shade that works for you this is a decent product for summer time. It mattifies your face and provides decent coverage as well as providing SPF. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again unless they make more shades.</li>
    <li> This seems like it gives good coverage but i got it in a shade to dark for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> okay so I&#x27;m seventeen and i have the skin color of an indian person which is fine but it makes finding colors to suit me very difficult. this stuff is horrible. it looked like i took abobe clay and rubbed it all over my brown face. My mother called me Tonto and laughed hysterically. The color may be deep, as in \\&quot;I went to the tanning salon and tanned only my face a deep sunburnt orange color\\&quot; but it isn&#x27;t at all like the picture suggests and as it so cleverly says in tiny lettering it is just a \\&quot;simulation\\&quot;. I have acne prone skin and although it made my blemishes disappear it also made me look like a tanning addict. It wouldn&#x27;t have blended at all and i would&#x27;ve looked horrible. maybe the \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; colors are better but unless you&#x27;ve tried this out before and had a good experience i would not recommend buying this stuff online. I&#x27;m also disappointed that i have to give it one star, yes it was THAT BAD.</li>
    <li> I used this quite a bit before I found something else that I prefer. I prefer Nicka K mineral pressed powder now.  This Garnier is just ok because it doesn&#x27;t provide all day coverage.  I don&#x27;t want to keep having to reapply anything every two hours.  Otherwise, its decent and I like the fact that it has sunscreen in it.  It could be good to use as a moisturizer under my pressed powder if anything. It looks great when you first apply it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many bb/cc/ tinted moisturizer creams from those at Walmart from brands like Garnier, Covergirl, L&#x27;Oreal etc to those at Sephora like Smashbox, Clinque, Bare Minerals, Urban Decay etc, and have not found at bb cream that handles my combination skin so well nor blends so well. Sadly, as the winter came, my complex cooled and now this gives me an orange tint. Definitely perfect for the Floridian or summer time!</li>
