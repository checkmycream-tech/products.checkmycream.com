### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great quality!</li>
      <li>Great nail polish.</li>
      <li>It looks great.</li>
      <li>Went on great</li>
      <li>Great go-to color</li>
      <li>so I do get to purchase Essie for the nice price of $4.00 a bottle instead of $8.00 at the drug store, however, they did not carry this color!</li>
      <li>I loved this color.</li>
      <li>and it looks great with the Essie &#x27;Matte about you&#x27; over the top.</li>
      <li>Love the formula!</li>
      <li>I love this Essie Polish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn many brands of nail polishes over the years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m usually satisfied with 2 coats of this polish.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had to apply more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I typcially love Essi nailcolor because their brushes are designed to make for an easy and quick application.  </li>
      <li>but when I tried this color on I absolutely fell in love with the way it looks.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfectly pitch black and very shiny.</li>
      <li>Great rich black color.</li>
      <li>This polish glides on so nice and the color is deep and rich.</li>
      <li>Applies so gently and smooth</li>
      <li>Worth it</li>
      <li>/&gt;*Downside, this bottle had no essie sticker on it…so it looked out of place lined up in my collection of essies that I&#x27;ve bought from the store but was still worth the cheaper price that amazon offered</li>
      <li>And the nail polish looks good for at least a week on the hands (if you don&#x27;t use a top coat).</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this polish, it is so pretty and black</li>
      <li>It very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but i absolutely adore it.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>IT DID NOT STAY ON VERY WELL, EVEN WITH A TOPCOAT</li>
      <li>and it was a better price here than in Walgreens or other Essie retailers that sell it for $8.00</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a honest, pretty, mature black polish, defiantly give this a shot!</li>
      <li>When it comes to pure black creme nail polish, I have to say that Essie&#x27;s Licorice shade is my favorite.</li>
      <li>The product I received was pretty old.</li>
      <li>Lovely velvety black.</li>
      <li>Essie&#x27;s Licorice nail polish is a classic, affordable nail polish that I will use for years to come.</li>
      <li>:) I had to apply two coats for the black to be pigmented!</li>
      <li>I love this black nail polish, kinda gives it a soft grunge kinda look</li>
      <li>had the old label and bottle style.</li>
      <li>I do Chinchilly on my thumb and pinkie, Licorice on my middle finger and Armed and Ready on the remaining two fingers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>IT WAS LIKE THE NAIL POLISH WAS OLD.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is a yellow based black, it&#x27;s a very true black.</li>
      <li>Lasts long and is a pretty, shiny black.</li>

<li> a classy black that doesnt make you feel like a gothic teen.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s one of my favorites, I usually pair it with Essie Chinchilly, and Armed and Ready creating an ombr&amp;eacute; manicure.</li>
<li> I hate spending more than like $2 on nail polish, but you really do get what you pay for.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as other Essie colors I have</li>
<li> It dries quickly, but it will look muggy after a few days if you don&#x27;t use a topcoat.</li>
<li> formula is a little runny compared to some of my other Essie polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I just consider Essie&#x27;s Licorice shade a fashion staple and a definite go-to nail polish if you wear lots of dark clothes, especially black, and like the color black.</li>
<li> the blackest black i have found.</li>
<li> Thought I would never be a fan of black nail polish</li>
<li> It is black.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a fan of black licorice candy, but I&#x27;m a fan of this licorice nail polish!</li>
<li> I can usually go 4-6 days without a chip using Essie.</li>
<li> Essie lasts and this color is very black, just like I wanted!</li>
<li> My nails usually grow out before this nail polish even chips!</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>

    <li> I love this black nail polish, kinda gives it a soft grunge kinda look but i absolutely adore it. I recommend buying it!</li>
    <li> the blackest black i have found. shiny without sparkles. a classy black that doesnt make you feel like a gothic teen.</li>

    <li> Lovely velvety black. Is pearl.</li>
    <li> Great quality! Applies so gently and smooth :) I had to apply two coats for the black to be pigmented!</li>
    <li> I typcially love Essi nailcolor because their brushes are designed to make for an easy and quick application.  It dries quickly, but it will look muggy after a few days if you don&#x27;t use a topcoat.</li>
    <li> For some reason this nail polish chipped after one day. I can usually go 4-6 days without a chip using Essie.</li>
    <li> I loved this color. It&#x27;s perfectly pitch black and very shiny. Coats on evenly, and doesn&#x27;t even chip! My nails usually grow out before this nail polish even chips! It very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Downside, this bottle had no essie sticker on it…so it looked out of place lined up in my collection of essies that I&#x27;ve bought from the store but was still worth the cheaper price that amazon offered</li>

    <li> I am very pleased with this polish, it is so pretty and black and it looks great with the Essie &#x27;Matte about you&#x27; over the top.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist so I do get to purchase Essie for the nice price of $4.00 a bottle instead of $8.00 at the drug store, however, they did not carry this color! It is black. Obviously. Great go-to color and it was a better price here than in Walgreens or other Essie retailers that sell it for $8.00+!</li>
