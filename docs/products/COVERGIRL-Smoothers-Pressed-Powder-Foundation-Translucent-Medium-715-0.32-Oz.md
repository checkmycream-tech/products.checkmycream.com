      <li>Been using this for years, the best, most handy compact for my purse.</li>
      <li>Its that good.</li>

      <li>nice powder good price smooths on nicely too</li>
      <li>I love Cover Girl Smoothers!  </li>
      <li>Cover Girl Smoothers Pressed Powder is very comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>this one makes my skin look smooth and shine free...and it matches my skin color!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product many times.  </li>
      <li>Used this for years...never found anything I like any better....</li>
      <li>This is my favorite powder.</li>
      <li>I love this powder I&#x27;ve been buying it for years</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product but go easy if you have older skin.</li>
      <li>The compact itself is light and easy to carry.  </li>
      <li>Easily applied, covers nicely, rich color.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this, it was given to me as a gift from my aunt</li>
      <li>The mirror isn&#x27;t of the cheap, cloudy variety, and is helpful for your lipstick.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I was able to purchase the translucent medium color because the two stores where I shop never seem to carry this shade.  </li>
      <li>Good, but next time I will buy something not tested in animals.</li>
      <li>I use very small amount of this as a finishing powder, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
      <li>wish they would have kept the original, but this one&#x27;s good....just twice as much!</li>
      <li>this will do a good job covering my pores (which have gotten a bit larger as I&#x27;ve gotten older).  </li>
      <li>It is the right shade for my skin</li>
      <li>i do re-apply throughout the day but that&#x27;s a teeny tiny price to pay for finally having a great powder.</li>
      <li>(she has more money then a 20 something who just opened a business that demands time and money, movies are expensive to make LOL)</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I wanted - translucent and not too powdery.</li>
      <li>Actually, I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, but it is no longer available in my local drugstores.  </li>
      <li>I really hope they never stop making this because I would be lost without it.</li>
      <li>I love CoverGirl products, but I also love some other major and minor brands</li>
      <li>I found one of the older boxes at a local CVS with the round circle on the top and it was the original formula.  </li>
      <li>The new Smoothers Pressed Powder Foundation is very chalky and looks cakey on your face.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I used Covergirl since high school and that was over 30 years ago.  </li>
      <li>The old formula had a slight satiny or iridescent glow and went on very smooth.  </li>
      <li>It looks like it&#x27;s time to look for a new powder.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for making this 45 year old feel younger.</li>
      <li>I thought it was my imagination and ended up ordering on Amazon hoping they would send the old compact, but I received the newer compact.  </li>
      <li>The new formula compact says Covergirl in powder blue letters.  </li>

<li> about every other month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The Amazon price is less than I pay in the stores.  </li>
<li> like how well it covers everything, and although it is heavy for a powder it isn&#x27;t heavy as a foundation itself, oil bases are worse.</li>
<li> Must mean I like it?</li>
<li> Can make crapey skin look worse.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so sad that they changed the formula.  </li>
<li> So sad.....</li>
<li> i dont have to wear a base with this.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon, It was expired!!!</li>

    <li> I love CoverGirl products, but I also love some other major and minor brands so I&#x27;m not being brand bias. I enjoy this, it was given to me as a gift from my aunt (she has more money then a 20 something who just opened a business that demands time and money, movies are expensive to make LOL) and I get it each time she comes to visit, about every other month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how well it covers everything, and although it is heavy for a powder it isn&#x27;t heavy as a foundation itself, oil bases are worse.</li>

    <li> Good, but next time I will buy something not tested in animals.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product but go easy if you have older skin. Can make crapey skin look worse.</li>
    <li> I love this powder I&#x27;ve been buying it for years and I dont think I&#x27;ll ever change.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite powder. I have been using it for as long as I can remember and I&#x27;m very happy to be able to order it on Amazon. I get compliments on my make-up all the time and I owe it all to Covergirl. Thanks for making this 45 year old feel younger. I really hope they never stop making this because I would be lost without it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Cover Girl Smoothers Pressed Powder is very comfortable to wear. I couldn&#x27;t even feel it - no caking when my face got sweaty or oily later.  It goes on with no streaking or spotting.  The compact itself is light and easy to carry.  The mirror isn&#x27;t of the cheap, cloudy variety, and is helpful for your lipstick.</li>
    <li> i have finally found my color and i hope cover girl never stops making it.  i have tried dozens of powders and brands.  this one makes my skin look smooth and shine free...and it matches my skin color!  i dont have to wear a base with this.  i do re-apply throughout the day but that&#x27;s a teeny tiny price to pay for finally having a great powder.</li>
    <li> As expected. I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Like 20 years. Must mean I like it?</li>
    <li> Have been using the CG Pressed Powder since 1981!&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would have kept the original, but this one&#x27;s good....just twice as much!</li>
    <li> I love Cover Girl Smoothers!  I&#x27;ve used this product many times.  This is the first time I was able to purchase the translucent medium color because the two stores where I shop never seem to carry this shade.  This is the perfect shade for me!  The consistency of the powder is great.  I do not use a foundation yet this will do a good job covering my pores (which have gotten a bit larger as I&#x27;ve gotten older).  I do have to occasionally reapply this product during the day, especially in the summer, but I do that with any powder I use.  The Amazon price is less than I pay in the stores.  Great product, great deal!</li>
    <li> nice powder good price smooths on nicely too</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted - translucent and not too powdery. I don&#x27;t where a lot of makeup (I&#x27;m an eyeshadow only girl) but I needed something for shine and this did the trick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon, It was expired!!!</li>
    <li> Used this for years...never found anything I like any better....for any price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it, but was disappointed to recieve open packages from Procter Gamble Cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I use very small amount of this as a finishing powder, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Actually, I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, but it is no longer available in my local drugstores.  Therefore, was happy to be able to get it from Amazon.com.  It is the right shade for my skin and I haven&#x27;t found another face powder product about which I can say that.</li>
