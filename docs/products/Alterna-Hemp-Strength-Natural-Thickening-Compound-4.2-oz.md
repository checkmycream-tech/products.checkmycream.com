      <li>I love this product and will always use it!  </li>
      <li>This is very light, not greasy at all and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>; when the old stuff was perfect.</li>
      <li>If the price is too good to be true..</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love the fullness and body it gives my hair.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>it is:)</li>
      <li>Use to get it at a Salon and then noticed I could get it for a better price at Amazon.</li>
      <li>It was lighter, held better.</li>
      <li>I like the original formulation better.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and dos</li>
      <li>This has a strong scent to it.</li>
      <li>Gives fine hair texture, volume and control</li>
      <li>It give my baby fine hair some needed body.</li>
      <li>Adds thickness to my otherwise baby fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This is the best product for fine limp hair.  </li>
      <li>Aroma is different and not as pleasant; consistency is sticky, not as creamy.</li>
      <li>This is the best I have used, I have thick hair</li>
      <li>Best hair product for my thin fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I bought it online, and what I got was a product that added the word &amp;#34;Strength&amp;#34; to the name.  </li>
      <li>It is pricey but am willing to pay for the hair that results.</li>
      <li>The formulation is clearly different than what I used before and has more hold.  </li>
      <li>Great product - wet or dry</li>
      <li>and it does provide volume without really gooping up the hair.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it with except its predecessor product.</li>
      <li>Really amps up volume</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m neutral on that and wish the scent was lighter and had a less strong hold!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used many hair products other than shampoo</li>
      <li>This is the only product I can use on my rather fine hair which makes it have not only volumn but shine, as well.</li>
      <li>and it has a chemical smell instead of the natural organic smell it used to have.</li>
      <li>I found an old photo of the product on my phone, which I had taken</li>
      <li>But it still does the trick, and actually I can kind of use the extra degree of hold, which leaves the hair neither stiff nor dull-looking nor fake-shiny.  </li>
      <li>I only hope that we can find a new product somewhere that works and smells as well as this one used to!</li>
      <li>This is packaged like the previous Alterna thickening compound but what is inside it much thinner liquid</li>
      <li>It no longer has organic in the name, the new product is very thin and has a strong perfume smell.</li>
      <li>I have been using Alterna Hemp Thickening Compound for a long time to give a little body and manageability to a pretty nondescript, thinning head of (male) hair.  </li>

    <li> I love this stuff. Use to get it at a Salon and then noticed I could get it for a better price at Amazon. This is very light, not greasy at all and smells amazing. It give my baby fine hair some needed body.</li>
    <li> Good for curling my hair. Have been using for  a couple of years now.</li>
    <li> My girls and I have been using Alterna Hemp Organic Thickening Compound for years and loved it!  Not any more!  Alterna has changed the product. It no longer has organic in the name, the new product is very thin and has a strong perfume smell. It still helps with detangling your hair and makes it shiny, but it no longer thickens and we cannot stand the smell of it on our head all day long. I only hope that we can find a new product somewhere that works and smells as well as this one used to!</li>
    <li> I love the fullness and body it gives my hair.  Unfortunately, the product is discontinued and I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders after substantial hair loss due to multiple surgeries 2 years ago.  My hair recovered, but I&#x27;m still using it daily.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product for at least 10 years.  This past order does not seem to work the same as it has the past ten years.  It does not work the same on my hair as it has all these years.  The consistency was different and the color of the product was different. Not sure why.  Will not order again.  After a decade, I will have to find something else that works.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to be the same product. Aroma is different and not as pleasant; consistency is sticky, not as creamy.</li>
    <li> Best hair product for my thin fine hair.  It is pricey but am willing to pay for the hair that results.</li>
    <li> Thinkener!  That&#x27;s what this is.  We used it a number of years ago and then lost track of it.  I found an old photo of the product on my phone, which I had taken so I knew what to buy when I went to the store.  But, alas! it is no longer in the stores.  So, it&#x27;s great to be able to find these things online and Amazon does a great job of getting in through the buy and receive process.  Great product - wet or dry and it does provide volume without really gooping up the hair.  Try it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Alterna Hemp Thickening Compound for a long time to give a little body and manageability to a pretty nondescript, thinning head of (male) hair.  This is the first time I bought it online, and what I got was a product that added the word &amp;#34;Strength&amp;#34; to the name.  The formulation is clearly different than what I used before and has more hold.  I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve changed it or if there are multiple varieties of the stuff.  But it still does the trick, and actually I can kind of use the extra degree of hold, which leaves the hair neither stiff nor dull-looking nor fake-shiny.  I haven&#x27;t used many hair products other than shampoo so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it with except its predecessor product.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will always use it!  Easy to use and dos great this for sine to your hair!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Adds thickness to my otherwise baby fine hair.  Smells great too. Doesn&#x27;t make hair crunchy or greasy.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I can use on my rather fine hair which makes it have not only volumn but shine, as well.</li>
    <li> From now on I will be careful to buy Alterna products from a known vendor. Seems to be a lot of counterfeit products fulfilled by third party companies...same with the Bamboo line. If the price is too good to be true..it is:)</li>
    <li> Alterna Hemp Thickening Compound was discontinued in our local stores.  I am happy that I found it through Amazon.  My hair looks fuller and earns compliments.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest. I like the original formulation better. It was lighter, held better. This has a strong scent to it. I&#x27;m neutral on that and wish the scent was lighter and had a less strong hold!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Gives fine hair texture, volume and control</li>
    <li> Really amps up volume...use Hemp Shampoo...no conditioner...add a small amount of this...also removes tangles...dry your hair upside down and voila...lion mane!</li>
    <li> This is the best I have used, I have thick hair but it works well and keeps my hair from flyaway.</li>
    <li> This is packaged like the previous Alterna thickening compound but what is inside it much thinner liquid and it has a chemical smell instead of the natural organic smell it used to have.</li>
    <li> This product has been my go to for several years now, and I think they are phasing it out.  I buy a back up each time so I have it on hand.  Not sure what I will do when the product disappears!</li>
    <li> I wish Alterna would quit messing around with this product.  Sometimes the compound is thinner, sometimes a different color.  Leave well enough alone.  It does work .... just tired of &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; when the old stuff was perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for fine limp hair.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and always get complemented on the shine and body of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble finding this product in recent months. It appears that Alterna has changed the thickening compound but it still meets my needs (just not as well as the previous one).</li>
    <li> Great transaction and price</li>
