<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. I have used this product for a year and it works exactly as stated. Be sure to follow the directions carefully. Don&#x27;t skip any steps, and it will work great. It does have a bit of a sting for about 60 seconds, and a slight after taste that goes away within 24 hours. But for the price, it just can&#x27;t be beat. It also lasts much longer than stated on the package. You can also add another layer when needed instead of removing the old, which is time consuming. I love this product, and by using it, I can keep my dentures snug without adhesives. There is just no way I can afford a professional dental reline on the top and bottom every few months, so this is the perfect alternative.</li>
    <li> This works but it has a stront smell and bad taste for at least a week.  I am also concerned that taste and smell might be caused by chemicals not good to ingest.</li>
    <li> This is probably fine if you just need a thin lining, but there wasn&#x27;t enough product for my needs. 1 packet didn&#x27;t even cover my whole denture, I used the second packet which was too much, but firmed up so fast, the excess didn&#x27;t ooze out.  I will continue to purchase the more expensive Perma-Soft [[ASIN:B00158J0EI B00158J0EI]] because it is cheaper in the long run.  Also, D.O.C. states it is only for temporary use, a week at most.  Perma-soft is good for up to two years (and longer).  So if you try this and aren&#x27;t happy, don&#x27;t give up, try the Perma-soft, it may be more expensive, but a whole lot cheaper than the dentist.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a new substitute for the Sea Bond realignment product that went off the market a couple of years ago. I was thrilled when I found this and bought 3 of them. I SO regret my decision!!! You cannot mix this stuff up...when you mix the liquid with the powder it instantly clumps up, and becomes a stringy mess!!! Totally unusable!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK PRODUCT!!! COMPLETELY WORTHLESS!!! I gave this one star only because there was nothing lower than that!!!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect choice on saving a whole bunch of money, or going to a Dentist. Some Dentists charge you up to $300.00 or more just to put in a Soft-Liner when you can get the samer results for just a fraction of that cost. Why waste the Xtra cash which is so much needed with this \\&quot;HARD TIME ECONOMY\\&quot;. This product is just as good, fits perfect, and lasts just as long, so for the price difference, get it here and tell all your friends and reletives to do the same. Very satisfied and I will tell my friends to do the same. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I tried (and used) this product before, to create a good grip on my upper denture.&lt;br /&gt;I found the mixture almost impossible to work with, due to lumpiness or clumping.&lt;br /&gt;The directions said to pour the liquid on top of the powder and mix.&lt;br /&gt;What would happen is that the mixture would get very lumpy and not mix very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer on this thread, suggested to pour powder in first and then mix the powder into the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;This worked MUCH better. I also suggest using a different mixing container.&lt;br /&gt;I found a circular shaped cap, from some empty bottle in our home and found that I can really stir the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;The enclosed \\&quot;tubs\\&quot; with the product are rectangular in shape and do not lend themselves to the stirring needed&lt;br /&gt;to mix the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the liquid and mixture is a bit caustic, so when you first bite down, to fit your mouth,&lt;br /&gt;do not hesitate to pull out your denture and rinse your mouth. The product has a slight chemical taste to it,&lt;br /&gt;A quick rinse feels good and will not negatively affect the setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, today when I created a new batch to do a new reline for my dentures&lt;br /&gt;The product mixed MUCH better than it ever did before.&lt;br /&gt;FWIW - box has lot # on it of \\&quot;11108F\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am letting it soak, as per directions, so I have not tried them in real world yet,&lt;br /&gt;but I had to write this review and share this&lt;br /&gt;The mixing is so much better than I experienced before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look out steak - here I come.</li>
    <li> I think I have tried all the products on the market to try and get my teeth to stay in and nothing works as well as this product. I was a little hesitant to use it at first because I didn&#x27;t want it to ruin my teeth but it didn&#x27;t. As a matter of fact it is very easy to use. Just follow directions. If you don&#x27;t like it you can remove it. But I have not had to remove it since I put it on. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the product.  Unlike others I followed the instructions carefully and the outcome was great.</li>
    <li> It  did not do right. I had to peel it all off.</li>
    <li> ooey, gooey!  tastes bad, too -- but it works -- I think I&#x27;ll go to the dentist and get a real reline.</li>
    <li> I will tell you that this Reline-It kit does exactly as it is said and supposed to do. It has a funky odor but that eventually goes away. When making it the smell makes you want to toss it out but don&#x27;t. Follow the intructions and it will work. It took two days for the smell that only you can smell cause it is in your mouth. Even my wife who is very sensitive about that didnt notice it.     How it works is most important. It feels like the soft reline you get at the dentist office. I am just 12 weeks post op and my gums are still healing so they are receeding quickly. If I went to the dentist every time it felt loose I would have been there 4 times already. In this case though it did work perfectly since I did just a light reline. It adhered to the denture and soft reline that the dentist had put in my dentures a month ago. That was my second and the reline-it became my third.     One thing to be careful of is to not use it thick. Too much will make an already thick set of teeth even thicker and harder to get used to.</li>
    <li> wonderful product! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It works, but wife was not happy with it.</li>
    <li> Worthless. Didn&#x27;t stick.</li>
    <li> I could not believe it when I found this! I used to buy this product for my husband all the time, from a different store, but they stop caring it and I was just to expensive on the net. But, of core Amazon has it and for an excellent price, it is a great product and the re-alien is very soft and last a good year or so.</li>
    <li> came on time! i tried the product yesterday. first off, add the liquid FIRST than the powder, slowly, a little bit at a time. then it states to bite down, does burn a little as other reviews stated. i just popped them out and back in, did that a few times. haven&#x27;t had a chance to really wear my dentures, i tend to not on the weekend. the real test will be at work! lol. not bad price, so what does it hurt to try?</li>
    <li> First the good: I was impressed at how quickly it arrived in the mail.     The Bad: I followed the instructions by putting the powder in the little dish and then adding the liquid from the tube. It clumped-up on me and I couldn&#x27;t get the mixture smooth. I went to their website and the Q&amp;A page. I didn&#x27;t find a good answer for a fix. So I had to toss it.     A week later I tried it again with the 2nd repair. This time I put the liquid in the dish 1st and slowly added the powder while stirring. This worked...I was able to reline my uppers with no problem.     I am undecided if I will purchase this product again. I feel the instructions should be rewritten.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful. It does the job on time and as promised. I have ordered itm twice. I may order it again unless it is available from Walmart or some local store. Thanks</li>
    <li> Well, it finally happened.  I let my \\&quot;Prime\\&quot; membership get the best of me.  I purchased this product solely because it was the only product of it&#x27;s type that was \\&quot;Prime\\&quot; eligible.  I did read all the reviews, and followed the instructions - including popping the liquid agent in the freezer for a few minutes.  It still made a clumpy mess. The chemical taste is still overbearing - 6 hours and countless mouthwashes later. I have been using a relining kit from Perma-Soft for years - with perfect, long-lasting results every time.  I&#x27;ll be without my lowers for the entire holiday weekend and then some, as I wait for what I should have ordered in the first place.  There&#x27;s a reason this product is so much cheaper......it&#x27;s so much cheaper.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This product when you mixed it was very clumpy, not smooth at all.  If you pour it into your dentures and it drys clumpy it will end up being painful.  I do not recommend this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Thank u so much,saved me a trip to he dentist.  alot cheeper this way and its the same way they would have done it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with my denyure fitting due to bone loss, so I have used denturite for years and very sad its gone..so I&#x27;m searching for a comparable soft reliner, the D.O.C reliner actually burned and blistered my gums! I mixed it exactly like the directions say I very unhappy!</li>
    <li> Have used only the prosoft prior to this,and the prosoft worked very well,with little odor or mess.This DOC reline-it kit is quite the opposite.This stuff gives off a chemical smell that will linger in the house four days,let alone what it is doing in your mouth.Sure we all shrug off the horror stories of the awful taste,and get it for the price,but its that cheapest on the market for a reason.Awful taste.Burns your gums,and the process takes twice as long to set,so its burning for twice as long.&lt;br /&gt; I swear a bunch of dentists put this product out there just to scare people back to their chairs to pay the 300 bucks for a hard reline.Seriously,at the very least pay the extra 5 bucks for a better brand.Extra 10 for the prosoft,with no hassle and minimal smell or discomfort.No brainer.&lt;br /&gt; Also,don&#x27;t go strictly by the included instructions if you do use it.Says to let set 30 seconds before transferring to denture,but you&#x27;ll be dumping a very thin liquid in if you do this.Let it set until its semi firm and wont run everywhere.Thirty seconds gives you maple syrup consistency.Again,thinking dentists did this to screw with us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I give it two stars simply because in a pinch,like on vacation and nothing else is available,this will work and get you through,but you wont enjoy the taste of food for a few days.I would just stay away from it.We are all trying to avoid the dentist and the high bill and having your teeth out while they reline them a couple days,but still,spend a few more bucks.</li>
    <li> I used this over 20 years ago and it works great! I have not had to reline them since. I am, however, going to re do my dentures just because it&#x27;s been so long and I&#x27;ve quite smoking...just want a &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; mouth. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just finished making up my second reline batch.  It is critical to put the tube of liquid and the powder packet in the freezer three minutes.  It really slows down the set-up time when mixing.  On the first batch I got too much of the liquid in the powder and it turned out smooth but too thin and soupy. This time I cut back on the liquid a bit and that helped.  I got a nice thicker layer on my lower partial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just before I put the fresh gooped partial in my mouth to conform the goop to my gums, I cover the goop with a pre-cut and shaped piece of freezer bag, like zip-loc. I cut it large enough to overlap all the partial edges a full inch front, back, and sides.  This keeps the strong chemical from touching and burning my gums and mouth during the 6 minutes impression time.  I tried Food Wrap the first time and it just wasn&#x27;t thick enough enough to protect my mouth.  I made it to 4 minutes but the sting and discomfort were almost more than I could bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, to get rid of the odor and toxic fumes still coming off the reline, I soak the partial for 24 hrs in strong soda (sodium bi-carbonate) water.  This helps neutralize the strong acidic nature of the reline chemicals with a strong alkaline substance.  Then, to further absorb leftover toxic chemical, I soak it in clay- or charcoal-water (1 tsp clay or charcoal to 4 oz water) for another 24 hrs.  Then, I rinse it off and let it air-dry.  I found that these added steps helped get rid of that bad odor and taste.</li>
    <li> It worked it made my dentures fit after I did a repair on them. I am using it right now and I am expecting to repeat the order when and if I need to reline again.</li>
    <li> I come from the Scotland in the UK where they used to make a similar product that seemed to go out of existence some years ago. Whilst visiting family in CA - I went into a pharmacy in Sacramento to see if I could just find something to ease my really painful, ill fitting bottom set.    I bought two products, this was one of therm - I was just delighted to find it was similar to the long lost UK item.     I got total relief and comfort withing 30 minutes of first opening the box. Today is my second day and I can&#x27;t believe how confident and comfortable I feel about my bottom set now.    I am all set for the first steak I can get to today. The first steak I will be able to enjoy in a very long time.    This really is a great product - I have just ordered 10 boxes to take home with me. No kidding.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use.  Highly recommend! Gave one kit as a gag gift for Christmas, it turned out not to be a gag gift. They loved it and have thank you many times.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me and as another reviewer said, this stuff just lumps up instead of mixing smooth and makes it impossible to line a denture.  It is a WASTE OF MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - March 22, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I e-mailed Majestic Drug Company on March 17th asking for help in using their reliner.  Please read the e-mail and the reply from them;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Majestic Drug,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please tell me how to mix the D.O.C. Reline-It without getting the lumps.  I followed the enclosed instructions and also your FAQ instructions online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q- What can I do about lumps in the material when I mix the liquid and powder?&lt;br /&gt;A- Mix vigorously and try to thin out the lumped material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot get the \\&quot;clumps\\&quot; out of the material as it sets up long before it is smooth enough to use.  I have gone through 2 boxes (4 applications) and all have the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really discouraging and I need your help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello CAM,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip, put the liquid in the freezer for no longer then 3 minutes.  That will prolong the setup time and you will be able to mix the powder with the liquid without it getting lumpy.  If you do not have anymore kits, please give me your full name and address and I will send you a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wendy Rosenblum&lt;br /&gt;Office Manager&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the replacement reliner from Majestic Drug today and followed Wendy&#x27;s tip and guess what.  IT WORKED PERFECT. This stuff is super simple to use.  I will update as to how long it lasts compared to some of the other products out there.</li>
    <li> this product is priced extremeley reasonable but it does not fully mix leaving lumps in the goo but I used it to fill in gaps made from another product,also the bad taste stays there for a month or two.some go away in 3 to 5 days.I tried another one for 13 or 15 dollars after pelling the old stuff off and I can say it is sure nice to eat things with out my dentures slipping and hurting my gums.my dentist said my gums had receded to much for a reline to get any suction, but this soft reline does make suction enough to eat alot of different foods.</li>
    <li> The first couple of days were great, the fit, the feel couldn&#x27;t have been better, but then it started dissolving, and became rough, making my gums sore. Wish it had lasted longer. $20.00 thrown away!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, and after using this product, I was still shocked by the strength of the chemical taste/smell.  It did not go away, even after a week.  A water/baking soda soak didn&#x27;t help.  Speaking of a week, that is how long this lasted in use before it became brittle and began to come apart in small bits.  In defense of the product, it does say in the instructions you should get to the dentist as soon as possible, but I was hoping for longer than a week&#x27;s worth of use.</li>
    <li> 2/27/16 ordered again and used expedited shipping. Was supposed to be here between the 25 and 2nd. It just now shipped today which is the 27th. I wouldn&#x27;t have spent the money on expedited if I knew it was going to take this long to ship! Last time I ordered it came fast... Not this time :-\  with regular shipping it said it would arrive on the 2nd which is the day its supposed to arrive paying $6..and I had to email them yesterday asking when it was going to be shipped..today I got an email saying it just now shipped!  And to help those who have been having lumps.. Mix fast and put into dentures fast! It sets up very fast so you can not do this slowly lol. Make sure your dentures are clean, dry and ready. Leave it set for a few seconds after putting it onto your dentures so that it molds better when you put them in. Bite down as you normally would and keep closed for a few mins.. It tastes bad and may burn a little but keep closed! Do your others the same way. Afterwards take them out and peel off any overhang. I use scissors so I don&#x27;t take too much off. And over the next few days I find that sometimes I have to take more off to make it comfortable. These will last me months! And never had a problem with lumps. I have put the liquid into the freezer for a few mins to help with lumps but still never got them.    2014 I used to buy these from Walmart but they don&#x27;t sell them anymore.. So i wanted to give these a try.. They are not the same as the ones at Walmart and they mix a little different. These ones kinda burn a little when it first hits your gums and it&#x27;s a little more runnier so try you best not to swallow it. After a few minutes the burning goes away and it hardens a little. It&#x27;s just at first. Other then that it works great :) It just takes getting used to. After so many times of using it you will find out the way that works best for you. It did it&#x27;s job :)  The shipping was fast,I&#x27;ll be back again :).. Hope this helps....Thanks!!</li>
    <li> this is a good product but the after tast and burning of the gums has lasted for over a week</li>
    <li> kind off high price for this. dont last long</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and much cheaper than going to the dentist for a reline.</li>
    <li> it works that&#x27;s all I can say for now........</li>
    <li> This is a great product to have if you have a loose or uncomfortable fitting denture. I use it all the time. Once you have used it a few times, it is easy to do. Just take your time the first time so that you get a good fit. There is a taste to it in the beginning but it goes away fast.</li>
    <li> The taste is nasty but the instructions tell how to remove the taste, it works! I have purchased this product before from this seller with great results.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I USED THIS PRODUCT AND IT DIDN&#x27;T HOLD MY FIXED DENTURES. IT WOULD LAST FOR ABOUT A HOUR OR SO. I HAD FOUR BREAKS AND I THINK THAT WAS TOO MUCH TO HANDLE, BUT IT HELD FOR A WHILE. I NEEDED TP HAVE THEM FIXED BY DENTIST. NOT THE PRODUCTS FAULT AT ALL.</li>
    <li> I will continue to order this product, It always works great and is super easy to do. I have recommended it to numerous people.</li>
    <li> This was the worst thing i could have used on my dentures. This stuff was all rough felt terrible tasted worse.do not buy this stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best for the money I use it at least 3 times a year.If you need your dentures relined this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I used this product many years ago and it worked fine but they must have changed the formula cuz now it is AWFUL! I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the mixing and relining, that worked fine but putting that sucker in my mouth and keeping it there has proven to be the problem. First, it flat out burned my mouth for the six minutes required to let it set up and then there&#x27;s that gasoline, solvent, or chemical factory taste that wont dissipate! With every mouthful of food I taste it, not some mild hint of a wisp of a taste, no a full fledged, go to a gas station, turn on the pump and suck on the end of the hose taste! I did as they suggested with soaking in baking soda and hot water several times, no success. I then tried soaking it in vinegar, not working, next I&#x27;m considering throwing my dentures in hot coffee but I&#x27;m afraid of turning my teeth brown! In the past you never had the taste problem or had to soak in baking soda, it even tasted fresh and minty. I guess the EPA got involved and made it better, safer, and greener, leave it to the bureaucracy  to screw up a good thing!</li>
    <li> This was for my father, he swears this is the best repair product on the market.</li>
    <li> Tried it. Not my cup of tea. To much hassle &amp; mess. No opinion on product quality.</li>
    <li> followed the instructions given, and the product worked as well as expected. I think it maybe better on the second attempt.</li>
    <li> Great product, Worked very well. Would buy this again. Great for a quick fix til you can get to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Thank God I found this item! This item used to sell in stores all oven town. Because, Dentist were losing their 400.00 a re-line they took them off the shelf! Well thanks to this item I can stay away from high Dentist cost and do it myself and it works better than a Dentist re-line. I must re-do the re-line about every 3 mo. Rather than the dentist where its ever 1 year and the insurance company will only cover a re-line by the dentist every 2 years.</li>
    <li> I purchased that product for my friend who complained repeatedly that her dentures are moving freely in her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I did read the instructions and very informative customer&#x27;s reviews. I put powder into liquid previously placed in refrigerator - and it mixed nicely. My friend is telling me that she is very happy with the results. I am giving 4 stars because this Reliner does not last for long and the process has to be repeated on regular basis.</li>
    <li> Odor is too strong!  The product works well if you can get by the smell.  It has a strong epoxy type smell.</li>
    <li> perfect just what I needed</li>
    <li> fairly short term help. seemed to dissolve away rather fast, a previous used brand lasted much longer. priced about right.</li>
    <li> Undoubtedly, it was old!  It didn&#x27;t mix right -- was lumpy.  I have used this product several times before and it would be creamy as you poured it onto the denture.  This was more &amp;#34;lumpy&amp;#34; and thick and would not spread.  In 3 or 4 days, it was still uneven and distasteful, so I picked it all out.  Don&#x27;t want any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;John T. Robinson</li>
    <li> This reliner fit well, but.  I could not get rid of the taste and smell. Horrible.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years and other than&lt;br /&gt;the odd exception I am very happy it how it works. READ the Instruction well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it numerous times, love it.  READ the directions, cool the liquid before mixing and use WAY more baking soda than they suggest or the taste lingers.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing I had a spare today as the liquid had leaked out of the tube and there wasn&#x27;t enough to moisten the powder.  Had to throw it away and start over with another kit.&lt;br /&gt;The price varies between sellers so look for the cheapest and/or free shipping.</li>
    <li> I opened the package followed derections, and POOF my dentures re-lined to my specifications I opened the package followed derections, and POOF my dentures re-lined to my specifications</li>
    <li> I couldnt get past the taste of this product I fixed it the way the directions read to do but it would not set the way it said it would i would not reccommend this to anyone sorry</li>
    <li> like i said its pretty good its not quite as good as the one i use to use that was taken off the market but it runs close and i took every ones advice on mixing and i had no problem my old liner lasted for way over a year ill update this and let every one know how long it lasts</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and so far I like this one better. It is also alot cheaper than the other products.</li>
    <li> did not work out for my mother, horrible taste and did not harden. go to your dentist it is better in the long run.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to reline my mom&#x27;s dentures in between her dentist visits. The lining the put in doesn&#x27;t last very long so I had to find something else to use. This is so quick and easy to use; just make sure not to let it set too long and once you put it in your mouth and bite down bite down how you&#x27;d actually eat but no so hard that it pushes too much of the liner out. Once you bite down and hold for a  minute or so be sure to rinse it in cool water as it will take some of that aftertaste out of it; then you can trim the excess from the denture. Used to be able to buy a product from the grocery store/drugstore but noone seems to carry it anymore so have to go online to find this. It does work, it is easy to use and it is quick. Excellent product for my  mom!</li>
    <li> Only gave one star because I had to give one to give review.  There we&#x27;re suppose to be to treatments, one of them was empty.  Tried the second and it didn&#x27;t cover the plate, wouldn&#x27;t stick I followed directions to the letter.  Glad I only wasted $6.00.</li>
    <li> Works as expected,as always.</li>
    <li> The fix should last longer than  a week.  Why bother.</li>
    <li> This liner was hard. Not comfortable at all.</li>
    <li> Works great, i am going on 6mns on 1st reline-it. Only downside is like other have said the taste and smell is pretty bad but if you want to reline them bad enough its great for the price.</li>
    <li> I would probably use this product again, however there are 2 things t consider. First, you may throw your dentures out alignment and cause yourself some jaw problems or headaches. But then again, who has $200 for a denture center? Second, I didn&#x27;t feel like the product &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; for a day or 2. I had small, soft pieces of plastic peeling off for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, I would recommend it but it is a process that may have to be repeated more than once over a short period of time.</li>
    <li> NEVER again.  Everything mixed fine, poured it on, stuck it in my mouth.  Less than 10 seconds later I pulled it out due to the taste and the burning.  I pulled off the liner completely, soaked dentures, and STILL had that acrylic nails taste.  Have now put dry dentures in a plastic baggie &amp; covered with baking soda.  Hope it gets the taste out.  You should NEVER stick anything in your mouth that tastes like that.  At least I only wasted five bucks.  Yuck.  What garbage.</li>
    <li> Thanks to all that went before me I had a sense of what it would be like. I took the freezer advice and the mixture came out perfectly. Aside from the nasty ass turpentine flavor. it all went well and I am quite pleased with the result! I only wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to do it!!!</li>
    <li> Honestly have to say that I was very hesitant to try this but I am working far from home and away from my dentist so figured I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4stars but that was just for the smell alone. If you follow the directions, it&#x27;s very simple, however I did use the plastic wrap that a poster advised and it worked beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;The only advice that I recommend is if you use denture cream use that to measure how much reline-it to use.</li>
    <li> This is a good product to use at home.  I find that it is easy to apply, although the taste is not appealing, however, it holds well and does the job as advertised.</li>
    <li> Easy to prepare and price is great, but the substance hardens too much to wear them comfortably day after day.  The substance does not &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; at all the next day, so  it will not hold them in.</li>
    <li> This a good alternative to expensive professional reline.</li>
    <li> Works better than any Denture Reliner so far. My wife has had many difficulties  finding a reliner that works for her. when I purchased this Denture Reliner I didn&#x27;t hear anything about her denture&#x27;s not fitting correctly, making her mouth sore form adjusting the dentures. I could go on and on but just believe me this product is great and I hope you will try it out. you will be happy you did.</li>
    <li> This is by far, the worst possible product out there.  It smelled like industrial chemicals and when you put the dentures in not only could you smell it, you could now taste the hideous smell. And as soon as you put the &#x27;relined&#x27; dentures in, you get this tingly sensation until it starts to feel like its on fire!  Please, do not ever try this, its just awful all the way around.  I&#x27;ll stick to my PoliGrip, thanks!</li>
    <li> DOC Reline-it works great but wearing the dentures causes the reliner to begin to peal away from the dentures and then you have to do the process all over again. I have found that it is helpful tu use denture adheasive to re adhear the reline-it back on the denture.</li>
    <li> Product mixed and applied as direction said.. But the taste is horrible to say the least! I used a baggie as some suggested to keep it from burning my mouth but even this did not help... After soaking in baking soda as directed for 30 minutes the taste was still unbearable.. After several hours I had to remove the product as everything tasted like nail polish.. I would have to think if one can taste this horrible stuff that it surely cannot be good for you. I purchased and used Perma Soft.. works great and has a mild after taste that goes away after about 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Not as good as other reliner products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> this has the most awful taste and it lasts almost as long as the liner.  It actual made me feel sick</li>
    <li> Takes too many steps to make it work for just 1 week. Not worth the effort it takes to use it.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly. Probably the worst poison tasting burning stuff I&#x27;ve ever had in my mouth. As another reviewer wrote, next time i&#x27;m going to wrap my denture in plastic wrap before putting it in my mouth. Cause......Damnnnnnnnn It&#x27;s horrible.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work well. However, the stuff in the tube that you mix with the powder smells like super glue. Moreover, you have to do it in a well ventilated space or you&#x27;ll get a buzz. The worst thing is when you put it in your mouth and bite down for six minutes, I felt like my gums were being blistered. I had tears running down my face. The burning sensation was terrible. But after I got through it, it seems I have a good reline. I just hope the smell goes away quickly. It smells like I&#x27;ve been sniffing glue or something.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Walgreens. It is horrible. It was a mess to use and install and the paste never gets smooth. I had this product installed for a week and the taste was so bad I could not eat with them in. The taste never went away. It tasted like fake nails and the smell lingers forever. I removed this product and tried a product name PermaSoft. I love PermaSoft. It costs a little more but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> very helpful product -- does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;Jim-Dandy</li>
    <li> IT WAS HORRIBLE USED BOTH OF THEM AND THEY DIDNT WORK</li>
    <li> very good product,easy to mix and apply.</li>
    <li> The product is perfect.  The instructions were fantastic, easy to read and to follow.  I used the reliner on the bottom denture.  I used the product almost immediately.  I am glad I did.  My denture is more secure and food does not get under the denture as it did before.  I had read the reviews and the negative comments.  However, my experience was positive..  The reliner feels like the regular denture material, so it not uncomfortable (some said it got very very hard).  Also, some complained about the smell.  Although there is a taste and smell, it is not that strong and after a day or so it is gone completely.  I did the relining at night.  I used the baking soda and I also let the denture soak overnight.  Maybe, that helped in eliminating any strong odor. One other complaint was about the lumps.  But the company has now put it in the instructions about freezing it before use.  The price is very very reasonable and it works.  Besides, it saves a lot in dental cost.</li>
    <li> Another Update (5/17/14) - I&#x27;m still working this product, re-doing the repairs about every six months-ish. They updated the instructions to say put both powder and liquid in the freezer, but it doesn&#x27;t say to put the liquid in the mixing tray first, although that&#x27;s very important for getting it smooth. On the plastic wrap issue people are having problems with, the last time I just cut up a baggie and used both layers as a liner. No trouble with sticking and was easier to manage than Saran wrap, although it&#x27;s not strictly necessary. Also a pro tip: If you cannot find the mixing dish, don&#x27;t use a disposable Styrofoam bowl to mix it up. Oy! I felt very stupid when the solution ate through the bottom of the bowl...&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have redone my repair one since I wrote the original review, and while it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as a reline from the dentist did, it&#x27;s still an extremely good deal and works very well. I followed the same procedure as outlined below and had ZERO issues with clumps. The first repair I did lasted from late Aug through Thanksgiving, the next one is still working (now late March).&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I used this to reline very old dentures, a piece had even broken off the side and I was able to make a serviceable repair. It&#x27;s not to going to last for years and years I&#x27;m sure but it did help out tremendously in a pinch. And it was less than $10, so pretty low risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tricks to getting the best effect:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut a double-layer piece of baggie beforehand to line the inside of your dentures. There is a chemically taste to this stuff that&#x27;s somewhat unpleasant and if you have any irritation on gums from ill-fitting dentures or whatnot, it will probably bother you otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth some olive oil or vegetable oil over the teeth themselves where you won&#x27;t want the reliner to stick, it is extremely easy to remove any stray reliner that way, it doesn&#x27;t stick where it doesn&#x27;t go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can do both uppers and lowers at once if you want, I did and it was not a problem. In fact, it&#x27;s easier because you know you&#x27;re biting down properly and you may be able to get away with only using one of the two applications in the box that way if you don&#x27;t need as thick a reline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some differences from the directions for applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Put liquid and powder in the freezer for 3 minutes before mixing. I used a timer.&lt;br /&gt;2. Add the LIQUID to the tray first, not the powder.&lt;br /&gt;3. Gradually add the powder, mixing it in as quickly you go. It was VERY easy to get it smooth this way, none of the lumps others struggled with.&lt;br /&gt;4. For the mixing and application to the dentures together, you have about 3-5 minutes before it starts to set, PROVIDED you&#x27;ve put the liquid in the freezer before starting. Otherwise it sets more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;5. Follow the directions for waiting another 3 minutes before putting them in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;5. Line the dentures with the a baggie you&#x27;ve pre-cut before putting them in your mouth. It will save you most of the bad taste, no chemical in your mouth issues and did not stick for me.&lt;br /&gt;6. Remove the lining when you&#x27;ve molded it to your mouth and follow the directions for the rest of the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liner itself dries solid but still with some flexibility. They do smell EXACTLY like and taste like acyclic fingernails, that fades over a couple of days, it&#x27;s not overwhelming but not whoopee-yay, either. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased and would buy this again. I dock a star for insufficient directions, because if you follow them as is, you&#x27;ll struggle. Hope that helps!stick where it doesn&#x27;t go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can do both uppers and lowers at once if you want, I did and it was not a problem.

    <li> Sorry to report, this was a horrible choice and wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying! The smell alone was bad enough, ended up at the ER &amp; my Dentist, suffering with burnt, blistered gums, sipped warm soup &amp; liquids through a straw for 2 wks...had to take pain med and antibiotics to clear it up. A lesson learned the hard way!</li>
    <li> This reliner didn&#x27;t even last a day it was too thick and came out when I removed my dentures from my mouth</li>
    <li> It did the job and I&#x27;m real happy. The only bad thing was the favor was a little hard to take. But after that it was fine.</li>
    <li> After reading the instructions, I threw it away. Too many steps, an unpleasant odor and only lasts a week or so. The price was too good!!</li>
    <li> worked great, just like SeaBond - Only needed one package to do uppers and lowers - will buy again if needed</li>
    <li> Good if you want to reline your own teeth</li>
    <li> love this product and it works so well, have used for 10 years and saves me lots of money and solves the dental problem quickly and easily</li>
    <li> Works great, I use it once a month until I get my perm dentures.</li>
    <li> do a good job  i recommend this</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandmother. She followed the instructions to the letter &amp; it didn&#x27;t hold right. Every time she ate, pieces kept breaking off. I bought two boxes of this, needless to say I&#x27;m furious. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I ordered this by mistake, it is not the product I used in the past, I threw it away, could not even complete the instructions. It was so bad.</li>
    <li> reliner works ok but the new prod wants to clump up, i put powder at one end and liquid at other then mix seems to help rather than just dumping liquid ON the powder</li>
    <li> Product is inferior to other similar offerings. Poor resilience and not satisfactory as a denture soft lining material. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> Unable to use. Gave to a friend</li>
    <li> Tastes awful after application but seems to go away quickly. It did the job for me. Will buy again as needed.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.  I was using the sea bond product before.  They took it off of the shelves because it had zink in it.  The DOC Reline-it works much better than other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Perfect, right on time</li>
    <li> The reline does get lumpy,you just have to keep stirring hard to get it to smooth down.My biggest problem with this product is that it is NOT a soft reline it is a hard reline. Not as advertised! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Well this stuff mixed up fine for me. It did make my denture fix alittle better. But still had to use glue to totally hold into place. But can&#x27;t find a glue to work. And yes the taste is so awful! Not sure I&#x27;d recommend or use again ..but hey everyone is different. Might work well for you and its cheap.</li>
    <li> Product quality control is inconsistent from box to box.  Doesn&#x27;t really last very long on the dentures.  Only way you&#x27;ll get up to two years is if you just don&#x27;t wear the dentures.  Because of the lack of quality control, one box may not bother you at all and another box might absolutely peel your gums like crazy.  One box might cure to a slightly soft cushion finish and another might turn out rock hard.  Make sure you chill the stuff in a freezer before you try to mix it or you&#x27;ll be sorry.  Admittedly, they do claim it is only a temporary fix until you can have a professional make a permanent repair, and for legal reasons they give you a bunch of warnings about one thing and another, but, in a pinch, this product will get you through until you can afford to see your dentist.  By the way, be prepared for your dentist to give you a lecture about why you should have come to the dentist in the first place.  Give the product a try if you are the adventurous sort, but be prepared to be disappointed.  Don&#x27;t believe all the advertising hype!</li>
    <li> This product works fairly well to secure loose dentures. However, I found that I still  need to use denture adhesive cream to achieve the maximum hold. It&#x27;s a bit messy&amp; time consuming  to apply, but it usually lasts about 3 months, after which time it will begin to wear off. I will most likely continue to use this product until I am able to get implants.</li>
    <li> I had read these reviews before I ordered the product, but had forgotten the wise words of advise about adding the powder to the liquid instead of the other way around.  Just after I began to add the liquid to the powder (according to the enclosed instructions) I began to experience problems with clumping and suddenly remembered the helpful review (a bit too late. heh)  I continued working with the clumpy product and was finally able to obtain a workable consistency, however once applied, the finished product was uneven and painful because of the small lumps I was unable to remove.  Mixing it according to the package directions ruined the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mixed substance smells EXACTLY like the product used in acrylic nail salons. Any ladies who have ever had this type of artificial nails applied will be very familiar with the smell and the length of time it takes for that smell to completely disappear (certainly not months.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I agree with the review reply concerning gum irritation from the liquid. My gums began to burn, so I removed the denture several times during the \\&quot;bite down\\&quot; phase, rather than letting it sit the entire 3 minutes.  No harm done.  When your instinct tells you to &#x27;get it out&#x27; of your mouth, listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the point of this post is DO NOT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. Mix the product exactly opposite of the way the instructions tells you (liquid first.) Do NOT leave it in your mouth for a solid 3 minutes if you are experiencing gum irritation and burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a cheap alternative to a hard reline, this is probably it.  The result of this product is not completely hard, but it is certainly not soft.  If you want a soft, cushiony reline - use Cushion Grip.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say if the product worked well, or not, because it had such a strong smell like model glue that even after I rinsed it and put it in my mouth, that strong smell was still there. If you have no aversion to how a denture liner smells, this might work for you.</li>
    <li> Was very easy to use. It did what it said it would do. I will order more if need at some time as I likes this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I definitely recommend it to everyone.  It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts a long time.  Delivery was quick and I am well satisfied.</li>
    <li> Package arrived, incomplete. No directions and no applicator!!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have problems with mixing, as other reviews had, but the burning- OMG... it says the liquid is flammable and not to get it on your skin, but after mixing it you have to put it in your mouth and bite down.  It burned my gums even though they were not irritated. They are now! There was no way I could hold them in my mouth for 3 minutes. My throat and gums have chemical burns now. If I have to use this product again, I will use the plastic wrap idea to avoid burns.  And the taste- YIKES... my husband can smell my breath after 6 hours of eating, drinking, and mouthwash. It tastes exactly like the acrylic fingernails but who puts fake nails in their mouth?  This product would be great IF they told you to use the plastic wrap and if they could change the taste. READ UPDATE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I HAD to use this product again before the holidays.  Wasn&#x27;t happy but had no choice.  After opening the box I noticed that the directions have changed.  It says to put the product in the freezer for 3 minutes before mixing AND to put baking soda in the water when you soak them after fitting.  The mixing part was easier after the freezer- but I hadn&#x27;t had any trouble with that part anyway.  When I put it in my mouth it burned again.  I held it there anyway, and it eased up after a couple of minutes so I could stand it for the 6 minutes.  After soaking in the baking soda water for 20 minutes I noticed there was very little odor and very little taste!  The baking soda fixed that awful problem!!!  THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> works great IF you put in fridge for a few moments, otherwise it will not mix and there&#x27;s very little you can do with lumpy material.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions to a T...and it worked perfectly!  No more flipping when I bite down.  The smell and taste are a bit much, and the soaking in baking soda didn&#x27;t really help.  I put the liquid in the container and then the powder.  No clumps or lumps.  I will definitely be using this product again!</li>
    <li> This kit works but is not as easy to work with as others I have used in the past.(Acryline 2) The kit is about half the sizes and sets up all most to quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been awhile since another company quit making a denture relining product and now with D.O.C. Reline-It it&#x27;s nice to have a good fit once again.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  Good price.  I&#x27;ve used other reliners.  This is just as good.  No noticeable taste or odor.  Follow the instructions about pre-cooling the ingredients to give you more working time.</li>
    <li> FIRST THE PRODUCT  MIXING CONTAINER CAME IN RECTANGLE FORM MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO  MIX IT SHOULD BE IN  A ROUND CUP, THERE FOR IT CAME OUT VERY LUMPY BECAUSE IT BEGAN TO SET UP BEFORE I COULD GET IT MIXED (NOT GOOD) VERY PAINFUL WITH LUMPS.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS I&#x27;LL TRY ANOTHER BRAND NEXT TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KATHLEEN</li>
    <li> Great for the dollar. Equal to the $20 and $30 dollar kits. Plastic must be really dry or it will come off.</li>
    <li> I have used other recliners and they have not held up. This one is more like going to the dentist and lasts for ever.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for repairing uppers and lowers. Just make sure you follow the direction to the letter</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last few years and really like it.  It lasts longer than some products out there and costs less buying here at Amazon.  My only complaint is the taste and the sting when you first put it in your mouth.  They have added a few good hints in the instructions since I first used it (put it in the freezer for a while and soak in baking soda) that make it a little better, but if your gums are sore when you start it really stings.  I would suggest you wait until their not before you use it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works well but does not last very long</li>
    <li> I really like this as it last for a long time and don&#x27;t have to re-do it every week as I have had to do with other products .</li>
    <li> Easy to use but burns my mouth the whole 5 minutes it has to be in to mold it. Very uncomfortable but way less expensive than going to the dentist to have it done. This is the same liner I used to get at the store for almost $10.00.</li>
    <li> it met all my expectations</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this because it didn&#x27;t cost much. Following the instructions (putting it in the freezer for 3 min) made it easy to mix, but the tingling sensation in my gums when I molded them was much stronger than with other products I&#x27;ve used. The taste was awful. I soaked them in baking soda first for  20 minutes, then for an hour. finally soaking them overnight worked. the liners surface started feeling rough after about a week, but not really uncomfortable after 2 weeks it started to come loose in places so I removed it. Next time I will spend more and try a different product.</li>
    <li> A pain to use an get right. Be prepared to try two or three times to get them to fit right.</li>
    <li> Was very happy with the fast shipping.  I haven&#x27;t used the product, but read the directions which is a little harder to use the product.  I&#x27;m hoping I can do it properly.</li>
    <li> not real great, it does not cling to plastic dentures very good. came off 1st day. would not use again.</li>
    <li> it is easy to use,fits great and is very comfortable.no sharp edges to worry about with this product.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The taste was too strong,better off going to dentist.this product is to hazardous plus it burns real bad waste of money.</li>
    <li> worked great as a temporary fix.</li>
    <li> For those who wear dentures, this the best product you will ever use. It saves lots of money on liners and trips to the dentist.</li>
    <li> works as expected not a perminate fix but it does last months and easy to remove to do again just use a knfe to pry off old bits and redo</li>
    <li> very nice .Good transaction.</li>
    <li> This product is very good, I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> The taste will kill ya.....for about a week, then it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using reline-it for years and loved it  but this last kit left blisters where the plate sat I can&#x27;t even wear them right now because my mouth is so bad has the formula been changed or maybe a bad batch ?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this for its intention. But it works well for what I need it. Guitarist who have problems gripping picks, this stuff works like Gorilla snot. Wont drop your picks when you mix this.</li>
    <li> This reliner is a bit too hard for me. Otherwise it mixed and set well. Will be trying ProSoft soon.</li>
    <li> This stuff may be cheap, but it&#x27;s worthless.  There is so little material, it didn&#x27;t coat my upper denture fully.  One kit would barely work for someone with a full set.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  Get the Prosoft one.  It&#x27;s about $20 but has a lot more material with it.  If you have a full set of dentures, you would get 2 relines with that brand.  If you have only an upper or only a lower and mix only half the material each time, you would get 4 relines.  Don&#x27;t waste your money with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Lasts a long time.</li>

    <li> very easy to work with--&amp; does a good job.</li>
    <li> this product has a smell that will run you away and the taste is just as bad and they both last to long &amp; hard to get rid of.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product was okay but didn&#x27;t work for me my work with someone else I will not purchased this item again</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to temporarily reline my upper plate until I could get to dentist. Was not quite as good as the Seabond Brand I have used in the past. It is ok for a quick fix.</li>
    <li> i have to travel to florence,sc for a reline, even though it is free the 1st 90 days, this is much cheaper than having to travel, it was smooth for me, i had 18 teeth extrcted, so my gums are shrinking superfast, but its hard for the bottom partial which i don&#x27;t even wear but the full denture on the top is tight as heck, it really does help. i got 2 kits just in case, just don&#x27;t understand why you have to freeze it, same consistencey if you don&#x27;t. but bottom line good for a full not for a partial.</li>
    <li> Great buy, awesome price!</li>
    <li> This was the biggest waste of money I&#x27;ve experienced in a while. It did absolutely nothing the instructions said and lasted less than 24 hours. I did just as the directions stated but the product was a mess.  Thank God I didn&#x27;t ruin my dentures with this crap. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> My lower denture was fitting so badly that I was looking into dental implants and they scared me away with what they wanted.  I tried the DOC Reline it and got my bite back. Great product!</li>
    <li> I used something like this yrs ago, but could never find it in the stores, I&#x27;m pleased to be able to purchase the product again, its helped out alot. thanks</li>
    <li> I have used this before and it really does work well, Key is to make sure you trim off excess properly</li>
