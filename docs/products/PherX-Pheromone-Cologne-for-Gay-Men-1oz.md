<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fantastic product! Let me begin by saying that the way it works is twofold: it adds a definite layer of awesome cologne, sprinkled with a small amount of HSP. The second level is a mental level, increasing your confidence. While not exactly a miracle, this product gives any averge guy an edge. The first day I wore this I noticed a difference in the amount of attention I was getting from guys ( even straight guys!).  By the end of the day, I had plans with three seperate people!</li>
    <li> Nice fragrace...quick delivery. Not sure yet if it does more but has a good overall effect on my mood. Worth trying.</li>
    <li> this arrived in 3 days, I just don&#x27;t know if it works yet. I will spay some on and go shopping today.. I will update later.</li>
    <li> I will constantly use this I get many compliments from everyone it&#x27;s a light scent and it&#x27;s not overbearing both girls and guys like the smell of this its definitely worth trying it does draw attention!!!!!</li>
    <li> The product came pretty quickly with very easy instructions. The scent is pleasant as it reminds me of a light cologne I ised to wear. Though I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in attracting gay men, I do notice that it gives me more confidence to talk to guys. One thing I didn&#x27;t like though is that the seller asks you to provide a review for products you didn&#x27;t purchase.</li>
    <li> what it does for me is give me a little more confidence to put myself out there, and when i do i have a higher success rate.</li>
    <li> Great will order again soon</li>
    <li> I found the smell of the cologne to be really nice. I have no evidence of it having any effect on those around me, but I&#x27;ll keep testing. I have noticed that I feel more confident and comfortable when I am wearing it though, which is a good result in and of itself.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t initially want to spend this much on such a small bottle, but when I got it, it smelled a lot better than all of the &#x27;musty, musky&#x27; reviews I had read about. It smells to me, if I could make an artistic inference... picture a cabin in the woods with all of its windows open and the sunlight pouring in as the fresh spring air breezes through. In other words, zest bar soap and sandalwood incense. To me, it smells good. Its not overwhelming and could pass as a mens cologne fragrance. As for the attraction it is to bring, I have only worn it twice so far, but it makes me more aware of thinking about other men thinking about my smell. Which in turn makes me more confident. I will update my review later if I do find it to actually attract other people to me.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider it really working, I don&#x27;t think anyone even noticed I had it on.</li>
    <li> With this procuct i have not even seen a difference at all i will continue to use it till its gone but i am not satisfied at all i personally think it was a wast of $30.00!!</li>
    <li> When I first got it I smelled it and it smelled pretty good. So I put some on and go out to lunch as I am leaving lunch there is another guy walking out and I go out before him and hold the door he smiled and said thanks then as he was walking to his car he kept staring at me. He gets in the car next to me and would not turn away so as I left I smiled and waived. That night my boyfriend got back in town aandon the way home from the airport he couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off me . Iv noticed more people look at me and stair at me  overall I would say its a good product! Im excited to go to the club this weekend to really try it out!</li>
    <li> Yes it works and smell so good</li>
    <li> PherX for gay men. On the first day it was deliver. I went to 2 different gay bars. The first one this one guy follow me around the bar. The second bar, I made out with two different guys. Another third guy walked up to me and kissed my hand. Offer to buy me a drink. The second day , I went over to my ex-boyfriend place. He and I haven&#x27;t kiss in over a year. He hugged me and smelled my neck . And started kissing me ! We made out on his couch. On a scale 1 to 10 I would give PherX for gay men a 9.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed anything different. People still act the same towards me. But I love the smell. The smell is enticing.</li>
    <li> This Just Didn&#x27;t Seem To Work At All. No Changes In Anybody. I Would Buy It Regularly If It Worked.</li>
    <li> i bought this (PherX Oil) and was given an offer to try out the cologne (PherX Pheromone Cologne for Gay Men).  i have tried out both products recently and i did not see any much of a difference between the two with regards to efficacy. both of them work.  I&#x27;ve tried the oil and went strolling in a mall and have received second glances where normally, nobody would actively be looking with interest.  At work i used the cologne and people have been friendlier and have taken more time to talk to me.  I do not know if this pheromone for gay men only attracts men because it seems that even women and straight men seem to be somewhat friendlier than the usual.  I&#x27;m definitely getting more when my supply runs out.  -- cyr.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this cologne - would buy it for that reason alone. The fact that it is designed to attract others is just an added benefit. My experience with cologne so far has been great, but not sure if it is out of the ordinary vs. other colognes. Excellent scent at a great price. Will report back if unusual attractions begin occurring (grin)</li>
    <li> Ok this product smells great to women. Problem is I&#x27;m trying to arrack men. It does smell good, but it&#x27;s good mixed with the smell of the pheromone which you can smell and it makes you smell like you have body odor to other men as well!</li>
    <li> I work in retail and I remember a man coming up to me, he&#x27;s not that handsome but I did notice the smell and it just made my brain crazy gooey goo goo and I just started flirting with him. A few days later I stumbled upon this and ordered it out of sheer curiosity and to my surprise it smelled exactly like the man. So I&#x27;m confident it would work. I tested out, I&#x27;m a fairly handsome and confident and I get a lot of looks from straight men to gay men, straight women to gay women and when I work this I get more looks. My co workers talk to me more. There&#x27;s even this 1 guy that I think likes me already and when I used this his eyes are locked on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product and this is a 100% true review</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne mainly because it showed up when I searched for popular mens colognes. After some initial skepticism, I decided that all of the previous reviewers couldn&#x27;t all be full of it and went ahead and purchased. The package arrived promptly (I use the prime shipping). Even having read some positive reviews, my expectations for this product were not very high. I sprayed maybe 2 squirts on my wrists, one on my neck, and one behind each ear. I think that the product has a nice subtle smell on its own, but I also used some of my own cologne, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I met some friends out for dinner: 2 ladies, one straight guy, and one gay guy. Both of the men complimented me on my cologne within minutes of meeting. A few more male and female acquaintances mentioned the same thing later in the night. I can only speak for myself, but I noticed a nice boost in self confidence, too. I don&#x27;t think I was really attracting myself, but I do enjoy smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be brief, this cologne works in that it is a pleasant smell that becomes part of your aura/energy. People (I noticed more men, but women also seemed to like this cologne) will not instantly want to take you home or fall in love with you. But it never hurts to have another positive attribute in your corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: smells great on its own or with other cologne, works as promised, price&lt;br /&gt;Cons: smell wears off unless you bathe in it</li>
    <li> Bought this few weeks ago and yes I&#x27;ve been using it every day hoping the  guy I like will  smile at me!&lt;br /&gt;Well I must say that somehow this product works!  Now we have more conversations  than ever ,  although  I still waiting for him to take the next step!&lt;br /&gt;Something I don&#x27;t like about it ,  is that scent wears off quickly,  and the sprayer  release too much product at once!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son as a birthday gift. It smells subtle, but nice. He took it on his trip to NYC and although he didn&#x27;t meet the love of his life, he was complimented on how good he smelled. I dislike strong cologne, so this is perfect for my sensitive nose!</li>
    <li> I received this and am comparing to the oil-based version. This one has a little more immediate olfactory intensity, and about the same longevity. Interesting observation I have- it seems to be more noticeable on me by Latino guys than others. I&#x27;ll be clear and say not every single guy I encountered threw himself on me or threw his chones on me as I walked down the streets- by a long shot- but I&#x27;ve had some attention from a few that was pretty out there. I&#x27;ll keep using this. Thank you for the chance to test!</li>
    <li> I have try many type of the pheromone before but this one is absolutely a wonderful affected one. Just 1 stroke spray on your chest then you can feel the confident start to kick in . The smell is so lovely . You even fell in love with yourself . My lover lost his virgin when he smell this on my body . Alot of smile and head turning when you wear it on . Try it once and you will addicted by the result . It even worth for it own smell . Do havev a manly scent . Remember 1 stroke only . Do not used over dose . It too strong can  get the  opposite affected</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week. So far it seems to make people more engaging and friendlier. Haven&#x27;t really used it in a situation where attraction will really matter. I have also noticed it seems to make me feel happier and more pep in my step. I will continue to update as I see how it works in various situations.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for a friend because it is rather difficult to find gay men in the town that we live in. He&#x27;s a really sweet guy, but so, so shy! He wore this product for the first time and has received so much attention. He&#x27;s been asked out to coffee by this one guy that he&#x27;s been interested in for a while, so I would say this product is a success!</li>
    <li> Good product still testing it out</li>
    <li> I work in serving, lots of gays, they were touchier than normal the other day , even the straight guys and girls... I like this stuff</li>
    <li> Love the product smells great don&#x27;t know completely if pheromones work on me as of yet but still pleasant to smell</li>
    <li> Personally I love the odor of this product, and it turns out to be like, my roommate is attracted! lol...tho I don&#x27;t love him at all. Maybe I will use it before date next time, see how it works!</li>
    <li> I am really astonished by the first results it provided.  I don&#x27;t have much confidence in engaging for different reasons because I&#x27;m not a 10 looking for an 11, but here in the gay community it is very hard to strike a conversation because of superficial standards.  I am a 7 more looking for a 7, just well rounded in all aspects.  I bought this hoping that this would be a good starter, an ice breaker, to get my foot in the door.  I was hoping to use this to attract gay men to engage in good conversation instead of just a \\&quot;tricky\\&quot; conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have high standards and may come off as mean or whatever but I was always conscientious about it.  Non-approachable at that.  I am also afraid of rejection.  But when I ordered this i decided to give it a go.  So I put on about one good spray on both wrists and on both sides of my neck.  I did apply my cologne after it dried.  Just the PherX alone is actually pretty good I might say.  Then I went off to a gay coffee shop, not expecting anything.  At first I went in observed the clients and did not sense any attraction.  So then I forgot I had it on as time went on.  That&#x27;s when it struck me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the back to smoke a cigarette and surf the net on my laptop.  One of the workers was checking up on me, and was engaging back and forth over time.  We had really good conversations about all kinds of stuff, then I realized just how interested he was with me.  At one point he was siting with me, while our legs were just so touching.  I was like WOW.  But I did think was it me or just this product, it was certainly both!  It takes two to tango.  We became friends at a favorable level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added proof was the efficacy being stronger than my cigarette smoke, and yet he does not smoke, imagine that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so thankful this works-but realize it was my first attempt and he is gay.  The second time, I was certain I put way too little on my wrists and neck, 1/2 to 1/4 spray for both wrists and neck, as I went on base and it was a bit too weak for attracting the closeted hot military boys for conversation.  But I can add though, I did get lots of helpful people involved when I asked for help.  That&#x27;s certainly helpful as a shopper too.  I am nervous to use it for the gym, but when I am ready, I will just need to relax and be myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how this company did it, but I am floored by it and plan to be a regular user in appropriate situations, so THANK YOU for not forgetting us little gay ones who need it most.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when I first purchased this product but after one week of using it I can safely state that it does without a doubt work!!! I&#x27;m in the retail business and have a wide range of customers. I was mildly surprised at how many men became touchy feely and wanted to get closer physically. I LIKE IT (LOL) Now to try it on my date for this weekend. Thanks again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little stronger than the oil, but quite pleasant. It really seems to work. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to conduct a case study on college males and tier reaction to hormones as such. I got the package and skeptically sprayed my neck and went home. My wonderful fiancé hugged me and within seconds things... Escalated. He&#x27;s not incredibly sexual and never gets riled that quickly. I haven&#x27;t even started my study and I am more than happy with the results. BUY THIS!!!</li>
    <li> After a few days, noticed some guys, though straight, have been nicer. Unsure if this is affecting them or just a random happenstance. The scent is nice but very subtle.</li>
    <li> Placebo effect or not, I have noticed my confidence has risen substantially and have been receiving more attention from men. The scent itself is very masculine and almost reminds me of new leather. I have notice a slight scent change the longer it stays on my skin, but I personally prefer the way it smells after it&#x27;s been on me for a few hours. I will note that while all these statements are true, it doesn&#x27;t last longer than other fragrances I&#x27;m used to. One application will typically last 3-4 hours before it&#x27;s undetectable by my nose. Deodorant, body spray, cologne, you name it: this product was worth the ~$30 and has lasted me longer than I would have expected considering my frequent use. I plan on comparing it to the oil version to test for length of duration in the future.</li>
    <li> I havent tried any other brand of pheromones but this stuff really works.It smells Intriguing.  I wear it when I want to get laid. It brings out a curiousity in guys that is quite fantastic ;)  P.S the oil that this company sells is really good as well.</li>
    <li> If your looking to attract another guy this one is THE BEST you can get. If you go out to a club expect to get a lot more attention that usual. I had some great experiences with this. I also recommend buying the oil version of this product. I have tried other gay pheromone colognes and they didn&#x27;t work so well. Try PherX you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This fragrance attracts a lot of attention.  It is a real man magnet.  I love this fragrance myself so It is a definite attention grabber and that always gets me to smile.  I am confident with the extra help it gives me to turn heads.  I have used this love booster many times and always with great results. My Massage therapists always give hotter massages when I wear it.  It makes going out exciting and who knows what will happen when I wear it. Seriously thank you so much for making a great product that gives back fun.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it attracts gay men to me, but I&#x27;m attracted to the scent: Love the fragrance!</li>
    <li> While it smells great, I cannot confirm that it is working for me.  Need to do more tests during the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> The bottle is very small, much smaller than pictured, but it really does work, it really does attract gay &amp; bisexual men.</li>
    <li> I just received the spray that I ordered, but I am curious  about how the oil differs.  I have only used the spray for two days, but I believe that ALL men are reacting &amp;#34;more friendly&amp;#34; and open, and this gives me an edge in the retail clothing industry.  I look forward to trying the oil as well.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought I ordered at all. It&#x27;s lavender oil. Not pheromones. It sinks rather badly and now I&#x27;m quite upset is not the product  spent nearly forty dollars on. I&#x27;m very upset now. This isn&#x27;t fair.&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t waste your money .</li>
    <li> I recently purchased PherX in both spray and oil form. What a waste of money. I actually got far LESS attention once I started using it. Many people around me were put off by the smell, which they said smelled like household cleaner. One of my gay male friends asked if I was wearing insect repellent!!! I consider myself a decent-looking guy (6&#x27;1, 190, 33w, 32 y/o) and most people around me do as well. It&#x27;s just proof to me that there are no pheromones, or very little, in this product. Just bad-smelling cheap perfume. At least I have something to keep the bugs away and scare off unwanted attention. That&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for. NOT RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> No noticeable effects.  I recommend going with a traditional cologne of your personal preference.</li>
    <li> Just received the spray and it has a great smell.  Not sure if it works yet but either way, it smells good.  Shipping was quick and easy.</li>
    <li> seems to work great im attracted to myself ;)</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is intended to do, and then some. I have noticed attraction and/or generally more positive interactions with men and women alike. I tend to b getting more respect from people and allure. Now as to why I give a four out of five, I have also gotten a lot of notice from women which is not my intension. Not really a bad thing but has proven to be problematic fighting off both sexes at the same time. I also initially become very turned on myself to the scent and get touchy feely which us not appropriate in all situations. Regardless, I do love this product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to have my friends to smell it, but the scent is quite pleasant and subtle. It&#x27;s quite a confidence booster too :)</li>
    <li> I am currently testing the product, I was and still am a bit skeptical regarding the actual impact of the item. Not to sound conceded at all but being that i am a model I am unsure of wether it truly gives me an extra boost in my dating life. I will say that since I have applied the product It seems that 90% of people are constantly trying to get my attention. Again, i&#x27;m not sure wether its truly the pheromones or maybe just the mental boost I have from wearing it, but I do seem to be getting even more attention than usual.</li>
    <li> You will attracted more men with just soap and water</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  The smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering and goes with my cologne and body sprays.  It seems to work so far as I&#x27;ve had a few more guys interact with me when I go out.</li>
    <li> I have a straight friend who is very handsome. I have notice that he behaves completely different with me every time I use this cologne.</li>
    <li> I received the product at home very fast and well wrapped, no problems at all. I followed the instructions given by the laboratory and Wholly Cow that thing really works. I made more tests and I can say that the product really helped me to enhance my intimacy life with my special one. Just be wise on your choices</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0043QNR2K PherX Pheromone Cologne for Gay Men (Attract Men) - The Science of Attraction - 18mg Human Pheromones]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it last week, and within 2 days i got my shipment, that was faster than what stated in the shipping page, the bad thing that i tried this product and didn&#x27;t see much difference than without it, I guess i just waist my money.&lt;br /&gt;do I recommend it to a friend , NO NO NO. I wished it work but nothing.</li>
    <li> for starters this item did actually arrive to me unlike 2 other similar item i order from other sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wore this on my first dare with my ex and i can see the sparkle in his eye when he sat down beside me. people around me starting noticing me more and i starting having more guys courting me, even &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; ones</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of this. I can&#x27;t describe it other than the &amp;#34;sexy man smell&amp;#34;. I haven&#x27;t found anyone coming up to me trying to ask me out but I have noticed conversations seem to come easier and people do seem to come to me to talk more. I would say conversations can get racy quickly and without warning when I wear this. I find it elevates my mood just to smell it when it&#x27;s in the bottle. There is in fact something to this. I&#x27;d say buy it and try it out. I plan to order more myself.</li>
    <li> 5 stars!  Very nice and decent product and it works too!</li>
    <li> Gimmick... not worth the $$$</li>
    <li> I have been wearing the PherX Pheromone cologne for gay men for a week or so now.  I have to say, I am glad I&lt;br /&gt;made the purchase.  It works, and what a confidence builder as well.  I spray a little of it on after the morning shower,&lt;br /&gt;and in the evenings.  I have a str8 roommate (fireman).  Even he has been more touchy, feely and super friendly lately!&lt;br /&gt;The checkout dudes at the market even smile and chat more!  PherX cologne works for me....Rob in Washington State</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and I think that it actually turns guys on. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments from men about the way I smell. I believe this also attracts women. Whatever this is made from, it is certainly worth a try. Too bad it comes in such a small bottle...you should probably order two or three.</li>
    <li> Summary on experience (29 Jan 2015):  Administered two sprays, once at about 9am and another at 5pm. Both on neck.  Most significant reaction from others: Boss was quite chatty when in taxi (close proximity)  Most significant reaction from self: Slight increase in focus in the morning.  Overall Satisfaction: 2/5 as the results were not as expected, especially since 2 sprays were administered within a day and I interacted with several gay people throughout the day with little results. Only significant observation was the increase in social connection with passive/bottom gays, compared to active/top gays.    Having said that, this is only the first day of testing. With the little effects observed, I have ranked it a generous 2/5 at the moment as observations might not be conclusive from just 1 day of trial.    Detailed Journal:  8.50am - Administered 1 spray on neck. No significant self-effects observed.    8.55am - Entered elevator with a lady in late 30s. No reaction from her but that was expected since the PherX was targeted at gay men.    9.05am - Entered a packed train cabin. Was in extreme proximity with other commuters. Overwhelmed by many perfumes. No reactions observed.    10.30am - Felt extreme focus at work and was determined to complete tasks at hand. Not sure if it was due to the pheromones.    11.30am - Met a gay friend (Active/Top Role) for lunch. Nothing unusual happened. Conversations were engaging and lively but that is the norm whenever we meet up.    1.15pm - Shared a cab with my gay boss (Passive/Bottom Role) to a client&#x27;s office. He was extremely chatty with me and conversations steered towards non-work related topics. Maybe it was due to PherX?    1.45pm - Meeting with my client. Involves a Caucasian woman in her late 30s/early 40s and an Asian woman in her late 30s/early 40s. No effects on them. Neither did I feel more confident in the meeting.    4.50pm - Administered another spray on my neck.    5.10pm - Had a short discussion with two of mystraight male staff. No significant reactions from them.    5.45pm - Another discussion with another straight male staff. No significant reactions from him.    6.30pm - Left office and took the train to town. I sat next a male in his early 30s. If my gaydar is accurate, he is gay. The guy became a little distracted from his phone after I sat beside him. He sneezed twice, looked around and then went back to his phone again. Did PherX irritate his nose? When we reached the last station, he stood up immediately and dashed for the door. Hmmmm maybe PherX is scaring him away?    6.45pm - Met my gay friend  (Active/Top Role) for dinner and some shopping. No unusual reactions from him, nor any questions about the fragrance I&#x27;m wearing. We chatted as per normal and parted at 10pm.</li>
    <li> I gave this five stars because it smell fine and hopefully will attract guys. Have used it going out several times and at least it didn&#x27;t drive guys away :) so at least in my mind that&#x27;s worth five stars.</li>
    <li> Decent amount of product for the price. Has a nice aroma. Been using it for a few days and not many results yet, but I have high hopes.</li>
    <li> Personally, I enjoyed the smell moderately, after spraying it in the morning, but I had received some mixed feelings from friends. Some enjoyed the smell, other did not. It has somewhat improved my social interactions with other Gay men, so I will give it that. Overall it takes a bit of trial and error when wearing it with other colognes, but I would recommend trying this product out for yourself.</li>
    <li> So I have gotten M.B. before and it did not do much, or at least did not used it in places where I could attract guys and such. With this one, I put it on before a class where theres a couple of gay guys and one straight guy that is pretty into hanging out with gay guys. We barely talk, but this time we got pretty chatty and started saying how nice my letterman jacket felt. The down side is that this makes girls act weird too, not in a negative way, but they seem to open up and get touchy too, which kinda annoyed me. I will continue using it around those I&#x27;m interested and see what happens.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this item bacause the result is so fast and accurate!  Buy it now!! Trust me! You won&#x27;t dissappoint the result!!!!!</li>
    <li> the smell of this product is horrible the smell remind me of horse piss and funky body odor. i will not buy this product again, there has to be a better smelling product than this!!! what a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Excellent results; nothing magic here -- perhaps even largely psychological -- which is nonetheless real.  Highly recommended, though.  I do believe it has a powerful effect in the mystery of attraction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the spray and oil versions of PherX and while they do smell good, I&#x27;ve yet to see actual evidence that they work. Will keep using them and update this review as necessary.</li>
    <li> Pros: The scent is definitely pleasant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The amount is WAY small and the spray bottle sprays a LOT! Plus, I wasn&#x27;t as drawn to the smell as I was the oil G-3 smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Not quite sure it&#x27;s worth the price at all. I&#x27;ll keep trying it out, but if I don&#x27;t get results, I may just only get the oil.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on several occasions and it did not seem to produce a noticeable difference when interacting with other men.  I also tried the PherX Pheromone Oil, which did seem to have better results.  If I was going to pick between the two I would go with the PherX Pheromone Oil.[[ASIN:B00BOJUECA PherX Pheromone Oil for Gay Men (Attract Men)]]</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for about 6 months now. I was a bit skeptical about them at first, but I notice that there was a certain edge in my conversation with guys these days. They ask me what kind of cologne I am wearing more...we talk longer, I get more numbers, and more call backs. I have been working out lately, but I do believe that PherX does play a major part in my game plan in the dating game. You don&#x27;t have to believe me... try it yourself.</li>
    <li> Used the men&#x27;s version for attracting women.  It worked amazingly with men and women.  Saw this product and felt it is more appropriate.  Only been a few days.  I&#x27;ll give it a week and consider giving an updated review.</li>
    <li> I was at first skeptical of this item but I have experienced a change in the way my coworkers interact with me. My boyfriend is more touchy with me.</li>
    <li> It gave me the confidence to approach other guys. I like it so far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this spray over and over for years - it&#x27;s working and I ALWAYS gets comments like \\&quot;wow you smell good\\&quot; or \\&quot;where did you buy that cologne at!?\\&quot;... I usually put it on before going out on dates or clubbing or parties, and it does what it says - guys like the smell^^</li>
    <li> I was skeptikal about using this product, but once i starteed using it, i noticed a lot more people coming up to me and talking to me, both males and females. For gay men, i noticed that they will just talk to you longer, maybe not be attracted to you more. Everybody else it has the same effect on, and i find it quite funny! It is a nice musky smell too</li>
    <li> Hi, purchased this item and still not sure if it works nor not, can&#x27;t say for sure...has a good smell to it. Does not repel women or make me ugly...but not sure...?</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice that much change, some days it seemed like it was working well... Bought to keep positive climate in workplace.</li>
    <li> I had hear about human pheromones while researching how i can use scent to amplify my sex appeal. And much to my surprise, it works!!! I apply PherX Human Pheromone spray, to pulse points as well as armpits and groin, before an intimate encounter. And my partners cant get enough of me!&lt;br /&gt;I intend to keep a supply of this, so i dont run out.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;  Brendan</li>
    <li> I like it honestly. I have noticed that when I look nice and have a great attitude it works best. Most of the time guys are VERY nice and sometimes flirt with me, but I get the door held open for me a lot. I think it works best when you go out among men and between looking good, having a great attitude, and the spray on makes everything come together. I have yet to further experiment with it in a club or all man setting, this is just at work for me so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 60. I bought this product because I wanted to see if it worked. I was hoping to increase my social interaction. Not necessarily romantic, though that would be fine, but just to see if I got noticed more as the other reviewers said they had. I haven&#x27;t noticed much in the way of more attention from others. However, I have noticed the pheromones have an effect on me. I have a couple of chronic illnesses which have left my libido lacking as well as some of my medication. I haven&#x27;t really felt \\&quot;inspired\\&quot; for quite a while. Wearing this cologne has re \\&quot;inspired&#x27; me to the point that I\\&quot;m considering the possibility of dating again. I&#x27;m Very Happy with this unexpected result. I&#x27;m going to keep testing it to make sure it&#x27;s not a placebo effect, but so far I haven&#x27;t felt this much desire in a long time. Who cares if no one else notices  I notice and I love the new found \\&quot;inspiration\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Well I purchased this product and so far I haven&#x27;t gotten any reactions from any guys, going to keep using it to see if it works.</li>
    <li> I used this at work where I come into contact with many people. It seems to work well on women for some reason too. I am a gay man and I got frequent comments from women, one of which blatantly asked me &amp;#34;If you were straight, could I get it?&amp;#34; lol Guys did seems to flirt with me more but I haven&#x27;t done an experiment with a control group to really test me theory. It does kinda smell like perfumed nut sweat but I try to mask it with my regular cologne.</li>
    <li> This product is great got lots of attention with it on. It is far more reasonably priced than other pheromone companies. I found the scent fantastic. smelled better than a lot of expensive colognes. A very clean smell not anything over powering but still an attention grabber. Awesome customer service as well I had not updated my address and it was shipped to the wrong addres and they sent a new one to the correct address for me. Great company to do business with.</li>
    <li> I like that it smells good.I can&#x27;t say that I have experienced any difference in attracting men. I wear it whenever I&#x27;m out an about around other gay men. I just haven&#x27;t seen it affecting them being draw or attracted to me more because of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Why is Pher-x a awful product????, Well I heard from a source that there isn&#x27;t enough pheromones to attract your goal. After testing this product with pherazone. Pherazone seens to be more affective than pherX.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this product at first but I&#x27;ll try anything once. I sprayed it on and noticed the scent was amazing. Only problem I see with it, is that you have to spray a ton of it on for it to be noticeable (I have heard that the oils are stronger in scent).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I used a LITTLE of it the first day. Not much of a reaction. Then a few days later, I used a ton of it and I seemed to have more attention.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works, maybe it doesn&#x27;t. Either way the scent of this cologne is very nice and while I am allergic to most perfumes, this one I have no problem with.</li>
    <li> Went to their website first to check it out, and looked promising. I wanted a new scent that would make me feel confident.  I just got it and can&#x27;t wait to try it out! A friend smelled it and said they loved it!</li>
    <li> Lets start you must be sitting there and thinking does this thing really work? And is it worth spending the money? Simple answer NO it does not work for s*** it has a slightly citrus like smell which is not different from a bar Soap you already have in your shower. Even your deodorant will attract more men then this crap...save your money and buy a designer cologne you&#x27;ll be glad.</li>
    <li> This item get&#x27;s results. I do believe it does what it claims to do. I have had more fun that Ive had in a long time. Try it, and see if it also builds your confidence level. Now what does it hurt to try?</li>
    <li> I am no sure what this really does but I have no seen any results what so ever, waste of MONEY!!! This product has very little or no pheromones and if it does it might be animal pheromones which does not work on humans.  if you want a pheromones that work you have to spend a minimum of 100 dollars per bottle. I got one for my self, the box came with a prepaid return box incase I was unsatisfied, came with a book about the company, a page about all the ingredients in the bottle and it came with an extra very small sample of a different pheromone. I know it&#x27;s Is expensive but it does the work you would expect.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY pheromone cologne (and boy did i try a lot of them) where i felt a noticeable effect, both with men and women. People start talking to you just like that. Was in an ABS and all guys were following me around....in a Club guys wanted to cuddle and hug (and I noticed they were sniffing my neck (i had taken 2 sprays behing ears, 1 spray under each armpit and 1 on my hair)).&lt;br /&gt;NB bottle will not last long with such royal usage, so is not cheap.&lt;br /&gt;But a happy experience!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift for a friend that was down in the dumps and he said it really changed not only him but others around him.</li>
    <li> Just as described and more...</li>
    <li> This is the first time I use this I felt it might just be the same as just colonge. However, it was different. I was getting remarks from guys that I wouldnt expect to. SO this product does work.</li>
    <li> Ok so after reading the amazing reviews I told myself &amp;#34;ok sceptic, go ahead and get it, lets just see&amp;#34;.  Yea, no. It doesn&#x27;t work. It doesn&#x27;t smell that great either. The best thing I can describe it to is that old school cologne that guys or girls could wear called CK1 by calvin klein.  The smell is not off putting. But unlike other reviewers I didn&#x27;t feel like it was a scent I could spray my regular cologne over.  I also noticed that it wore off very quickly. The bottle is tiny, but was expecting that.  Honestly, I think that it is truly just a mental thing. &amp;#34;I have this scent with phermones on which is supposed to attract other guys so it must work&amp;#34; and as a result you are more confident and therefore are more apt to putting yourself out there more than you normally would. I love the idea that this would work. And maybe sometimes all people need is a little &amp;#34;liquid courage&amp;#34; but do yourself a favor, save your 30 bucks and spend it on a couple of pairs of sexy underwear, etc.</li>
    <li> After purchasing the Pherx Pheromone Cologne for Gay Men, I wore it to several public places in the past week  where there were a large number of men. I saw no evidence it helped attract men to me. I will test it out in two months when I go on an all gay cruise. If I do not experience any help attracting the gay men on the cruise, I will know it was a waste of good money. I am hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> somewhat worked, but didn&#x27;t really notice anything that different. I do like that they let you one of there other products for free</li>
    <li> The first thing I liked is that the smell was barely noticeable. Plus, a lot of people seemed......friendly.....and definitely more touchy :-)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure if this really works, I do know when I wear it I feel more confident and other gay men seem to respond differently to me.  I do like the fragrence, it is clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> It smells really good.  I get a lot of compliments every time i wear it.  I would definitely be buying more of this.</li>
    <li> The first time I put on this product I loved the smell.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it out in a public setting like a club yet but I have gotten comments and a lot of double takes. It&#x27;s also a great confidence booster</li>
    <li> OMG! I just received my cologne today I put a few squirts on and went to my local library. It was very crowded. I was using the public access computers &amp; I had several guys and girls actually ask me questions regarding different programs it was kind of strange, although I was working on programs which others didn&#x27;t know how to use but for some reason I really feel like its really working! I&#x27;m quite satisfied. I&#x27;m going to review more later, but so far so good:-)</li>
    <li> I tried other similar products in the past and I can tell there is a difference, PherX is more concentrated or stronger or something similar, I say this because one can really smell it, something that I like, and it stays longer on skin and on clothes. It is an advantage but at same time one should be careful not to reveal oneself intentions when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Also I noticed people looks at me more, like something is going on but they can&#x27;t really know what it is.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you know how to work with it, I&#x27;ll definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works, but I feel more confident when I put it on. It has a nice slight scent that stands alone or pairs well with any cologne. I&#x27;ve ordered it a couple of times.</li>
    <li> Noticed more looks, and random people smiling/ introducing themselves to me. One man even told me \\&quot;my vibes are making him hot\\&quot; not sure if that was the spray or me</li>
    <li> The company was efficient with getting the order to me quickly. Not quite sure anyone has smelled it on me yet but I keep wearing it....at least it smells really good for a cologne...very fresh</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product.  It actually works best in comfortable environments I am finding.  Being a polyamorous individual, I was recently  part of a group activity, and the newer party member was more focused on myself than he was on the other two.  It also worked on my best friend.  We often cuddle together for comfort, not really sexual, but I found him becoming antsy every time I was near laying next to him, so all in all I would say this product is working.  A little strong and not as subtle as the oil is, but still a great product.</li>
    <li> So I consider myself a pretty smart and internet-savvy guy. One of the ways that I decide how to buy a product on Amazon is by the product reviews. If a product has a lot of positive reviews, especially if they are &amp;#34;VERIFIED&amp;#34; purchases, then it must be a good product, right? WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I placed my order, I received an email from Zyloo, offering me a free product in exchange for leaving a good review on their items. It&#x27;s sad that all of these people left positive reviews.. just because they wanted to get something for free. Needless to say, the product did not do anything at all. Lucky for me, Amazon has amazing customer service and they refunded my order promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in pheromones, it&#x27;s easy to do an internet search and find forums where REAL people discuss the REAL products that work. I have since found an amazing set of products that do work. Just search for it yourself, the most popular ones work amazingly. Hope I saved someone the time and trouble!</li>
    <li> I just bought this and tried it for the first time, worked great! Not an overpowering scent. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Smells really good! Haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet, but the smell is great</li>
    <li> This was definitely a great purchase.. It makes me smell great and attract the confidence that I need to keep the guys coming! Everytime I wear it people always compliment me on how I smell! The price was awesome and the responses speak for themselves. I was skeptical in the beginning but I&#x27;m glad I was proven wrong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this a few times at work, and I noticed I was more confident, however, I didn&#x27;t notice anyone special checking me out.  Over all it&#x27;s a nice product very low scent so you can wear with other colognes.</li>
    <li> I seldom use cologne or perfume since i often have an allergic reaction of sneezing ... but this PherX Pheromone Cologne have a great smell and i love it.... it does not cause any allergic reaction.... I just don&#x27;t know if i should spray more since i still have not seeing any reaction from people.... or once in the morning and just small amount after office work would do the trick... need to test more... but i surely love the smell and it feel uplifting and energizing.</li>
    <li> This product not only smells very nice, but it really works.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a huge difference between a guy who gives you a hug and says, &amp;#34;You smell good&amp;#34;, and a guy who gives you a hug and says, &amp;#34;Mmmmmmm. You smell really good!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product can do that for you.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d try to put my regular cologne over this, because the fragrance (although nice) is strong enough to clash. But it&#x27;s nice enough to wear alone. And the pheromones definitely give it that &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> i just got my pherx today and put it on early evening about 6:00 pm on friday night had some friends over at 7:00 pm but no one really said anything about the way i smelled. i did not use any other colonge, just pherx. i put a dab under my armpits and a dab behind my ears and my wrist, i used no underarm deodorant, just pherx i did not think anything of it that no one said anything. but i did notice everyone was around me and the mood was great. anyway everyone left my home about 10:30 pm.  because of work in the morning.i stayed up watched tv and was getting ready for bed. so im getting my coffee set up for the morning and realized i have no light creme left. so i had to go to the quick check store down the street. and then i thought why not put more pherx on so i sprayed more on. went to the store and this was amazing to me. it is now midnight im waiting in line there are two guys in front of me. i assume were straight. anyway they got there items checked out. then the one guy turned around and just kept looking at me with such a stare that his friend said is everything ok. he just kept looking at me staring but not in bad way. it was a as if he did not want to leave the store and his friend said lets go, the guy had no idea im sure why he was looking at me with such intense. anyway i left the store got in my car and said to myself this stuff really does work. ive known about pheromones for a long time and i love the male scent of a mans sweat. always was a turn on for me the natural scent. this was my first time ever ordering a pheromone prduct and im in shock about it, this stuff is amazing. anyone thinking of trying it believe me this does work. and by the way i love the scent of it. jim from nj</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I had used a good portion of the bottle. I have found no change in how men or women behave when I wear it. Don&#x27;t expect guys will turn and look at you, don&#x27;t expect you&#x27;ll go into a bar and free drinks will be delivered. It attracts no more than good clothes or confident demeanor. It smells like perfumed cat or dog urine, so maybe it attracts them. My dog is always affectionate, but maybe he&#x27;s happier. Guess we&#x27;d have to ask him.</li>
    <li> Previously I used TEN, by intense and am experimenting with PherX similar but slightly different.  The aroma PherX fragrance is very pleasant and reacts well with my body chemistry.  When using pheromone products my interactions with other gay men are much more pleasant and productive.  It may be simply psychological, that I feel more attractive.  This size, 1 fl. oz., is perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> I love the way my energy change when I use this product is very very notable the change of your mood and energy around you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that people interact with me more overall. I haven&#x27;t had that much chance for flirtatious encounters however I&#x27;m excited to see the results I get</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really make all men around hungry for you but it really works. Most of my friends started to get closer to me. It really worked. Of course, most men are straight. But they all behaved as if they wanted to get closer with me. I like it!</li>
    <li> First, let me just say I&#x27;m not the type of person who believes in the claims of finding an attractant you can just put on and people respond but I&#x27;ve had several interesting experiences since I started wearing it. It does have a pleasant smell but I wore my regular cologne and didn&#x27;t notice the smell of the pheromone cologne.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for that extra something to attract other men to you then give it a try because I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m having multiple pleasant interactions with more men daily.</li>
    <li> This product is a scam. Please, please don&#x27;t waste your money. Do your research.</li>
    <li> This product came on time.  It smells good and may attact men although it is too soon  to tell.  I appreciate the science of smell and seem to be having a good time when I am wearing the phomone cologne.</li>
    <li> This company has really good service. As for the product, I noticed it smells really nice and I&#x27;m not sure if it works, but as for cologne based product it is def one with a nice scent. Worths a try!</li>
    <li> I AM UNSURE IF THIS PRODUCT IS WORKING OR NOT I HAVE TO DO MORE RESEARCH. SO FAR THE ONLY RESPONSES THAT I HAVE BEEN GETTING IS THAT WHEN I MIX IT WITH CALVIN KLINE COLOGNE ITS SMELLS REALLY NICE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now. I&#x27;ve been single for about two years and have trouble getting dates. I&#x27;ve had  three in the last 10 days or so! This product is excellent and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in how people react to me. Guys flirt with me more, and even women seem nicer (although not flirtatious at all). I&#x27;ll be keeping this product on autoship for sure</li>
    <li> This stuff is unreal. It smells like a current, upscale, designer cologne but it has a hidden kick! You can definitely notice a difference when you wear it. I wear it on my wrists and on the back of my neck right at the hair line. Let me tell you, you WILL get noticed ;-)  Try a bottle, see for yourself!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in a variety of settings (gym, work, walking around, parties, etc) and have seen positive results.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t limit this product to gay men.  In fact, I don&#x27;t think it has brought me any more attention from men (straight or gay)... Instead, it seems to welcome communication.  I would say that men and women find me more approachable and when wearing this it seems like people tend to chat more (can be a good or bad thing, depends on your goal).  I would recommend it for salesmen or those seeking to augment their social skills.</li>
