      <li>Good dealer.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to sleep on and give great curl.</li>
      <li>Very easy transaction.  </li>
      <li>These curlers are fantastic to wear to bed!  </li>
      <li>I could not be more pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>stay in place better if you wear a curler cap over them since they don&#x27;t require clips.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how well they&#x27;d stay in, since there are not any clips.</li>
      <li>Make sure it&#x27;s a ventilated cap</li>
      <li>I did have ONE out of the twelve I purchased come out reasonably easy, and it made lovely waves on that section of hair.</li>
      <li>they seem like they would be comfortable to do that with.</li>
      <li>Their comfortable to sleep in</li>
      <li>Really, if you&#x27;re wanting something that works well, try Snap and Wrap - which are not only comfortable to sleep in - they curl my hair GREAT.</li>
      <li>However, my hair nearly stood up on end from the static.</li>
      <li>Then again I don&#x27;t like sleeping in ANY rollers but the Sleep-In brand from the UK and those are hella-expensive (but so worth it if you ever want to try them!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
      <li>are sturdy enough and have a nice sponge inside</li>
      <li>but in the morning, my hair was flat and filled with static.</li>
      <li>These rollers came from China and were very cheap compared to what I had at my local salon and Walmart.</li>
      <li>Several reviewers said they were easy to sleep in.</li>
      <li>Can sleep with them very well.</li>
      <li>I start at the bottom and tug them gently out.</li>
      <li>Stay put really well.</li>
      <li>HOW MUCH HAIR AM</li>
      <li>go to sleep and wake up morning with ready hair to run.</li>
      <li>I ordered two sets and will be ordering sets of the two smaller sizes that are available here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I use these on the top of my head to create volume using a little bit of spray water.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money!!</li>
      <li>The curlers were still there in the morning, but most of them had pulled halfway out as my hair dried.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair and they worked very well for me, and aside from being a little scratchy to sleep on, they weren&#x27;t uncomfortable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They roll the same as the \\&quot;hard\\&quot; curlers and your hair is just as curled and good looking as the hard curlers.  </li>
      <li>They are soft on your head.  </li>
      <li>I ordered these about 2 wks ago, they came yesterday which I was really surprised since they said I wouldn&#x27;t recieve them until end of Feb/early March.</li>
      <li>and I woke up with bouncy softly shaped hair stylead if I had just had it blow-dried professionally.</li>
      <li>I wasted over $30.00 on these (bought more than 1 pack); wish I had tried them shortly after purchase so I could have returned them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pretty narrow , each only good for very small strand of hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if that was the difference in comfort that led to some high and some low ratings; mine were also shipped from China.  </li>
      <li>I have to say if you have straight and long hair</li>

<li> I have to say if you have straight and long hair</li>
<li> I had to wet it down and use hot rollers.</li>
<li> I then blow dry while curlers are in, then cool air, and then slowly unroll.</li>
<li> I purchased these over a month ago, but tried them for the first time yesterday - too late to return.  </li>
<li> I see really divided reviews between hate it vs love it.</li>
<li> These were a complete waste of money.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t see where they were different from any other velcro roller.</li>
<li> It was also more difficult to get them out of my hair (had to pull and tug a little).</li>
<li> use these with damp almost dry hair.</li>
<li> I have hair that goes a little past my shoulders, so I ordered the large size.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got long, thick hair and sometimes sleep in curlers if I have an early morning appointment or am camping.</li>
<li> Wet or dry!</li>
<li> but they&#x27;re not very flexible and that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like sleeping in them.</li>
<li> They must be harder sleepers than I am.</li>
<li> so I usually just use these to give myself some curl after my hair is dry</li>
<li> You have to secure them in  place at the base slightly off center, against the direction of growth of the hair, to get the volume.</li>
<li> In fact, my hair is almost TOO curly for a few hours, which is why I tried the velcro curlers.</li>
<li> The green cylinders detach from foamy sponge inside and do not hold the shape.</li>
<li> After reading a few reviews, I decided to give these a try.</li>
<li> I agree with other customers who see no added sleep comfort between these rollers and the hard ones.  </li>
<li> As for sleeping - not only were they as uncomfortable as they look -</li>
<li> could see that if you have long hair, these would be difficult to remove.</li>
<li> I usually put them in my hair when hair is a little damp and spray with a thin gel before rolling.  </li>
<li> I purchased these for the sleep comfort, but found them to be as uncomfortable as a harder roller.</li>
<li> However, they are merely a Velcro type sleeve stuck over a foam roller, and it can and will slide off with little effort...and I am telling you that getting these things OUT of your hair takes a LOT of effort!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve looked for these everywhere for approximately 17 years.  </li>
<li> My thin hair just get stuck in this velcro, instead of taking them off from curly strand - it brushes my curls away.</li>
<li> was disappointed when i received them because i thought they would be green</li>
<li> These curlers are very uncomfortable to sleep with in your hair.</li>
<li> They tangled badly and did not hold shape.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed in the product.</li>
<li> Also sleeping in any roller is terrible for your hair anyhow</li>

    <li> Works like I wanted them too. Can sleep with them very well. Stay put really well.</li>
    <li> I use these on the top of my head to create volume using a little bit of spray water. It gives me volume at the roots for one entire day . You have to secure them in  place at the base slightly off center, against the direction of growth of the hair, to get the volume.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Their comfortable to sleep in and my hair turns out great and then I don&#x27;t have to take time to fix it in the morning.</li>
    <li> Pretty narrow , each only good for very small strand of hair. The green cylinders detach from foamy sponge inside and do not hold the shape. My thin hair just get stuck in this velcro, instead of taking them off from curly strand - it brushes my curls away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked for these everywhere for approximately 17 years.  The only place I could ever find them was from the UK.  These curlers are fantastic to wear to bed!  They don&#x27;t leave the kinks in your curls that our foam curlers with the plastic closure leave.  You also don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re sleeping in rollers at all.  They are soft on your head.  They roll the same as the \\&quot;hard\\&quot; curlers and your hair is just as curled and good looking as the hard curlers.  I ordered two sets and will be ordering sets of the two smaller sizes that are available here on Amazon.  These are 1.889 inches in diameter.</li>
    <li> I have to say if you have straight and long hair this is really good to roll your hair go to sleep and wake up morning with ready hair to run.</li>
    <li> was disappointed when i received them because i thought they would be green and they were not and they have a funky smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got long, thick hair and sometimes sleep in curlers if I have an early morning appointment or am camping. After reading a few reviews, I decided to give these a try. Several reviewers said they were easy to sleep in. They must be harder sleepers than I am.I wasn&#x27;t sure how well they&#x27;d stay in, since there are not any clips. Turns out, they don&#x27;t stay in all that well. The curlers were still there in the morning, but most of them had pulled halfway out as my hair dried. As for sleeping - not only were they as uncomfortable as they look - but in the morning, my hair was flat and filled with static. I had to wet it down and use hot rollers. Thinking maybe they might take some practice, I tried again. This time curling my still damp hair in the morning and taking them out that evening. ZERO curl. None. However, my hair nearly stood up on end from the static. Not only that, the velcro split the ends, even after only two uses. I pitched them in the trash after only two uses. Really, if you&#x27;re wanting something that works well, try Snap and Wrap - which are not only comfortable to sleep in - they curl my hair GREAT. In fact, my hair is almost TOO curly for a few hours, which is why I tried the velcro curlers. I&#x27;m going back to what works. These were a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> These curlers are very uncomfortable to sleep with in your hair. I didn&#x27;t see where they were different from any other velcro roller. I was very disappointed in the product. I would not recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to take camping with me so I don&#x27;t need a hair dryer.  I can wash my hair in the evening and roll it, sleep on them and in the morning be the best looking gal in the woods!  They&#x27;re easy to sleep on and give great curl.</li>
    <li> I received the curlers on time and they were just like the description.  I could not be more pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I see really divided reviews between hate it vs love it. So I&#x27;ll take a stab at being a mediator.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used velcro covered roam rollers for years. I have baby fine hair and they worked very well for me, and aside from being a little scratchy to sleep on, they weren&#x27;t uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;They stay in place better if you wear a curler cap over them since they don&#x27;t require clips. Make sure it&#x27;s a ventilated cap so thevwater vapr from your damp hair can escape.&lt;br /&gt;I could see that if you have long hair, these would be difficult to remove. I start at the bottom and tug them gently out. Since I wear the cap to keep them in place this keeps the tangles from forming and makes it easier.&lt;br /&gt;I use these with damp almost dry hair. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d work as well with wetter hair.</li>
    <li> These rollers came from China and were very cheap compared to what I had at my local salon and Walmart. They work perfectly but aren&#x27;t very nice for sleeping in. Then again I don&#x27;t like sleeping in ANY rollers but the Sleep-In brand from the UK and those are hella-expensive (but so worth it if you ever want to try them!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are sturdy enough and have a nice sponge inside but they&#x27;re not very flexible and that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like sleeping in them. Also sleeping in any roller is terrible for your hair anyhow so I usually just use these to give myself some curl after my hair is dry or if I&#x27;m going to use my blow-drying hood.</li>
    <li> The size was perfect. They stay in place and I woke up with bouncy softly shaped hair stylead if I had just had it blow-dried professionally. Haven&#x27;t seen this type of roller in years and was delighted to find these.</li>
    <li> Great value.  As advertized.  Very easy transaction.  Good dealer.</li>
    <li> Well... I will say they definitely stick to my hair with no pins or clips! Wet or dry! However, they are merely a Velcro type sleeve stuck over a foam roller, and it can and will slide off with little effort...and I am telling you that getting these things OUT of your hair takes a LOT of effort! The wonderful \\&quot;it doesn&#x27;t require pins or clips\\&quot; turns into a nightmare of \\&quot;OMG HOW MUCH HAIR AM I PULLING OUT???\\&quot; when these things don&#x27;t want to let go of your hair or the rollers next to it! I did have ONE out of the twelve I purchased come out reasonably easy, and it made lovely waves on that section of hair. The rest of my head looks as if I styled it with a kitchen mixer...</li>
    <li> These rollers are the cheapest I have ever seen. They tangled badly and did not hold shape. Do not waste your money!!</li>
    <li> I purchased these over a month ago, but tried them for the first time yesterday - too late to return.  I agree with other customers who see no added sleep comfort between these rollers and the hard ones.  I purchased these for the sleep comfort, but found them to be as uncomfortable as a harder roller. It was also more difficult to get them out of my hair (had to pull and tug a little). I also believed they were from the UK, but the slip inside the package said \\&quot;Made in China.\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t know if that was the difference in comfort that led to some high and some low ratings; mine were also shipped from China.  I wasted over $30.00 on these (bought more than 1 pack); wish I had tried them shortly after purchase so I could have returned them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  After using these rollers for a longer period, I changed my rating from 2 to 3 star. I recommend wearing a cap over the rollers if you are going to sleep in them.  I usually put them in my hair when hair is a little damp and spray with a thin gel before rolling.  I then blow dry while curlers are in, then cool air, and then slowly unroll.</li>
    <li> I ordered these about 2 wks ago, they came yesterday which I was really surprised since they said I wouldn&#x27;t recieve them until end of Feb/early March. Not complaining at all though! I have hair that goes a little past my shoulders, so I ordered the large size. They work perfect for my hair, and make it look really nice, like I just did a blow out on my hair. I haven&#x27;t slept in them yet (I&#x27;ll try that out this weekend)but they seem like they would be comfortable to do that with.</li>
