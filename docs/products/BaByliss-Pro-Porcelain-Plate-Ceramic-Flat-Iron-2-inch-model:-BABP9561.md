<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Everything I expected....shipped on time &amp; described very well</li>
    <li> I like this straightener it has different levels of heat! You can straight more hair at atone since the plates are wider. Definitely recommend the product to others.</li>
    <li> Great heat, love the large plate for my full head of hair.</li>
    <li> Not too happy about it. I expected more from this product. I used it once and never touched it again. Left my hair frizzy and couldnt do much with.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter looks it.</li>
    <li> So far this has been a wonderful straightener! I&#x27;m very pleased!!</li>
    <li> I used it once and it didnt work again. Sent it back.</li>
    <li> I had this flat ironing my cart for a while before I bought it because I thought it was too good to be true. But I went ahead and finally gave in. The true test was using it on my daughters hair. She has really curly and course thick hair. With my old flat iron it would take us two hours to flat iron her hair but I can do it now in 45 minutes with the BB Pro. I don&#x27;t have to run it over one strip of hair fifty times to get it straight. One swipe and it is done. I did find that it is better to do it in smaller sections to get the best results. Her hair is so shiny once we are done. She gets so many compliments on her straight hair. Many people even thought she used a relaxer to get her hair that straight. You can even use it to flip a few curls or waves in your hair. She can wear it straight for about a week without touch ups. Unless she gets it wet, then she can go back over the roots to touch up.</li>
    <li> 2\\&quot; takes some getting used to but I&#x27;m so glad I bought this. The heat settings are good and the iron itself is easy to manage in my hands. My hair felt a little stiff right after curling/ironing but no real complaints so far. I think turning the heat down some will help.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is so light weight and easy to use. There is a large range in which you can adjust the heat, which is great for different hair types. My hair is straight as sticks after I run it through my hair just ONCE! I get done in half the time and the best part of all is that it doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair. I think that $32 is a reasonable price to pay for this because I&#x27;ve tried more expensive ones that didn&#x27;t work so well. The only gripe I have is that the packaging was horrible. It was so difficult to open and I got so frustrated. Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product.  Got great results--not amazing but totally worth the price and usability.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works very well! I&#x27;ve had a Chi for years and purchased this straightener has a replacement because my Chi wasn&#x27;t getting as hot anymore. This baby bliss get very hot and straightens my hair way better than my Chi ever did... I have very thick long hair so I need a hair straightener that get very hot and this one does the trick! Def recommend this product and what a great price!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this iron very light and easy to use.  If anyone looking for a good quality flat iron that is not heavy and easy to use I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice iron I really like get hot faster and I love that! Good so far I get my hair done in less time than before :) I do recommend this product</li>
    <li> good price and quick shipment</li>
    <li> Last July my daughter said she had to have THIS model because the lab manager where she researches owns it and had done my daughter&#x27;s hair with it before a big research presentation. She already had an uber expensive model we bought a couple years back at a kiosk at the mall that worked perfectly fine but apparently this Babyliss is the cat&#x27;s meow hair-wise. She passed the mall one on to me.</li>
    <li> I like this straightener. I like the width and it gets hot really fast but sometimes it will pull or break my hair from the bottom but I just release it by then and it doesn&#x27;t do it. Overall a pretty good straightener for the price. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this on the advice of a friend who has one.  For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  It heats up quickly and does the job wonderfully.</li>
    <li> this is  a really good straightener, the only complaint I have is if you touch the outside casing while using it , it is hot  overall it works great</li>
    <li> Love it! Very smooth and afforable!</li>
    <li> Does a great job, love the ease for use and speed to flattened my med length hair</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t as good as i thought it would be. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I got this Flat Iron back in April, and when I first got it I loved it!  Heated up fast, and did a great job straighting my hair.  I have maybe used this iron 10 times, and it is already shorting out.  I have to hold it a certain way to get it to stay on, so it takes me forever to do my hair.  I will be looking for a new one soon, I hate that this did not work out, like I said it was great in the beginning, but to short lived.</li>
    <li> This is the best purchase for people with hard to manage hair. Straightens it with no problem and FAST!! I recommend this to many girls if they are looking for a quality flat iron</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 weeks and it works the best of any straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned. I am very picky about straighteners. My hair is long, thick, and wavy/curly but I only wear it straight. Usually I max out the heat settings but on this one I only go up to about 415F and it gets the job done very efficiently! I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** If you have straighteners that break often, a good tip is to make sure you don&#x27;t wrap the cord tightly (or at all if possible). This breaks the cord where it connects to the unit and causes it to burn out.</li>
    <li> I have really frizzy thick hair .I have a lot of hair . blow drying just makes it worse .. this works really good on my tuff to manage hair . Quick .. would recommend it to a friend .. Made flattening my hair easy and fast</li>
    <li> Everyone loved mine so I had to buy 2 more.  These are awesome.  When flat ironing your hair you don&#x27;t have the frizzy hair.  It is smooth and beautiful.</li>
    <li> 6 years ago, I bought this same iron just the 1 inch model, never been happier, smooth feel and durable hair do. The 2 inch iron... does the trick, but looks like i did my hair in 5 min, when spending 2 hours trying to achieve a decent look. Wanted to renew myt old babyliss iron, now I deeply regret it. Dont buy please :(</li>
    <li> Awesome! Just what my wife was looking for. She was a little worried with the 2&amp;#34; plate, but she has loved it.</li>
    <li> It gets really hot really fast.  The only con is that it needs to be cleaned frequently or you get that burning smell on the hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing...I love it and use it daily!  Probably the best flat iron that I have ever purchase and I have very thick curly hair and it gets my hair board straight.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener. I&#x27;ve had a few different kinds including my 2&amp;#34; Chi. But this is by far my favorite. Makes straightening my hair so much faster and the finished product looks so much better!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron!! I am transitioning from relaxed to natural hair and this flat iron smooths out my hair so beautifully, it looks like I just got a relaxer!!  The BaByliss is so awesome, you can even curl your hair and the curls last for days!! I have a J. Beverly Hills flat iron that cost three times as much and the BaByliss is by far a better product.  Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> It is one of the best I have used.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping...Good flat iron a little on the heavy side, but it got the job done, i have long, curly, frizzy hair and it worked good.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  It leaves my hair feeling sooooo soft and shiny! Love love it! It Gets super hot!</li>
    <li> BaByliss are my go to products! They hold up well, the adjustable temperature and plates are great. My girls and I use this iron very frequently. We all have long thick hair and this iron does the job! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it - says it works well.</li>
    <li> After years of fussing and struggling with some drugstore version of a hair straigtening &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;, I bought the 2&amp;#34; flat iron model from BaByliss.  My hair stylist suggested it and he was 100% correct.  What used to take me hours of fighting and cursing and sweating with my hair, now takes minutes.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the ease this works thru my thick, super long hair.</li>
    <li> works great on thick hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a latina with thick curly hair so You can bet I&#x27;ve tried many products in my life.... this is the best flat Iron i&#x27;ve eve owned.</li>
    <li> This item broke after less than three months of use. It turns on, but won&#x27;t get hot. Amazon will not give me a refund and I am waiting to hear back from the company. It does not seem fair to spend this much and not have it replaced. I owned another BaByliss for years and it was great. This is very, very disappointing!</li>
    <li> excellent quality, and after 6 months it works perfectly</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned! Way better than my ChI</li>
    <li> muy buen producto&lt;br /&gt;supero las expectativas.&lt;br /&gt;Muchas gracias, la caja en perfecto estado y el producto bien protejido, ningun defecto</li>
    <li> great buy, this flat iron gets really hot, stays hot and makes my hair look super sleek and straight. I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old ceramic iron and I&#x27;m just sad that I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.  This thing is awesome and the price was amazing!</li>
    <li> Heats up really quick and takes me little to no time to straighten my hair. My hair is half way down my back. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product it work very very well you should thy it. Good for your hair its work</li>
    <li> Love this product.....what a great buy</li>
    <li> The BaByliss flat iron is an excellent buy especially for the price&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the low and high heat control&lt;br /&gt;The Ionic feature is impressive because moist hair will revert&lt;br /&gt;The ionic feature  neutralize the hair, closing hair follicles and smoothing the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate a well made product :)</li>
    <li> I really like this hair straightener! It makes the hair so shiny and healthy looking. It&#x27;s a great size too. I&#x27;m used to flat irons that are even bigger than this one, so I was concerned it wouldn&#x27;t grab a big enough section of hair - but it does. I love using it. The top and bottom of the flat iron does get pretty hot, so just be careful not to touch that part with your hand or touch the flat iron to your cheek or neck, etc. I would recommend this product if you want a quality flat iron for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It is light weight, heats up quickly, and does a great job.</li>
    <li> This is great. I have had 4 Chi brand in the last 8 years but this one works just as well &amp; is half the price.</li>
    <li> Nice product works as promised.I like the size of the Iron perfect for longer hair requires less time to have a finished style.</li>
    <li> Best purchase on Amazon!! These are definitely professional quality.</li>
    <li> i think so! ive owned just about every single hair iron known to man. ive started off using a real clothes iron to do my hair \\&quot;back in the day\\&quot;. bought a revlon that \\&quot;worked\\&quot; but always made my hair greasy after a day. had conair that broke, owned chi that was more about a price tag than results and now i ventured off into the \\&quot;babyliss\\&quot; line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to be honest ive never even heard of them before. i needed a new iron since the last one i owned from target (some generic brand that was on sale, bought it because my chi was acting up) took a poo on me as well. i did a search on amazon and found this. i just bought their travel hair dryer that was beyond outstanding and figured if that was great, why not this? i read the reviews and found a vast majority of them to be positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i tried it and not only does it produce a beautiful finish, it doesnt leave my hair feeling oily or dry or flat or anything! it just gives me a clean hair look thats straight and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would recommend this to anyone who needs a good quality hair iron for a decent price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-jill</li>
    <li> I previously purchased a BaByliss Pro Porcelain Ceramic flat iron from a professional salon about 8 years ago, and it worked perfectly for all of those years and I LOVED it.  It finally gave out on me, so I purchased this one - and they are nothing alike.  This is a very low quality product, and feels like cheap plastic.  Based on other reviewed I purchased a CHI straightener from Ulta.  I&#x27;m hoping it will turn out better than this one...</li>
    <li> I Love this Flat Iron! Works great.. and received in 2 days.</li>
    <li> The 2inch width is go for people with a really full and thick head of hair. Not so convenient for the edges of the hair but can be done. I have normal hair and i used it on 350 degrees and it didnt work as well as I thought so I had to turn it up to 400-450 degrees and it worked just fine. It does heat up fast and brings a little shine your hair as well.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this flat Iron, I have very curly hair and it straightens with ease! Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> This has been a great product. My hair looks good after use. I do regret not getting the 1 1/2 inch instead but this works also. I would recommend it. It glides easily and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.</li>
    <li> This is a really really really great product. I have really curly hair and this really cuts down on my hair styling time.</li>
    <li> This iron the hair in a fantastic way, it smooths the hair and the straighten it in an excellent way and last long. I&#x27;d recommend this device it&#x27;s awesome. If you want have a nice straight hair you should buy it!</li>
    <li> I love to use this babyliss pro!&lt;br /&gt;It works very good and long last!&lt;br /&gt;I can have any hair style!</li>
    <li> It get&#x27;s the hair sooo straight, one of the BEST flat iron&#x27;s ever made. You can&#x27;t go wrong with a Babyliss product.</li>
    <li> I looked around before buying this product. Many pages recommended this brand, I tried it and i&#x27;m not fully satisfied with it. I have long wavy hair and took me so long to finish with my hair. I&#x27;ve been told that ceramic hair straighteners are much better for hair than metal ones, something to do with the way ceramic heats up, so I tried other ceramic brands like PYT and it&#x27;s actually better for my hair and it doesn&#x27;t smell like burnt hair every time I do my hair anymore. I guess this one is suitable for girls with more straight hair to give it more shape.. not for wavy or curly hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I use this on all my thick or long haired clients. It does the job in a couple quick swipes. It&#x27;s amazing and have referred many clients to purchase this for their home use</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, curly/kinky/frizzy hair. I have always used a Chi iron. Based on reviews, I purchased this one and it is just as good if not better than the Chi! So so thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you, I own a few flat irons. From a really expensive one (GHD) to a cheap one (Remington) and this flat Iron performs the same as the expensive ones if not better. I do wish it had a comb like another Babyliss Flat iron I owned, but I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have tons of hair and it can handle high heat, this is the first professional iron that I have turned down a setting a straightens well. It has thin blades so you can get close to the scalp. The price was great and I am so happy I chose this!</li>
    <li> i love it, the quality and the price is great. the size is really confortable.&lt;br /&gt;I really  love it, because provided natural shine to the hair.  I&#x27;m a hair stylist, this flat iron is for a person who has a lot of hair. If you want it for personal use, is better to choose the small version. If you don&#x27;t use the right size for the amount of hair, it won&#x27;t come right.</li>
    <li> purchased for my daughter.  She has hair to her hips and she is very pleased with this iron.  It is a nice heating temperature and yet is safe on the hair.  Just don&#x27;t drop on your leg.. It hurts..</li>
    <li> I love this straightener.  It works just as well as my sisters chis without breaking the bank.  It gets so hot that you have to wait to touch your hair once you apply it.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t realize how poor quality my current flat iron was until i tried this one.  leaves my hair silky straight.  love, love, love.  heats up quick and very easy to use.  even on the lowest heat setting, the results are great!</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron. Extra wide to cover more hair and spend less time on the process.</li>
    <li> We have not complaints. The larger surface area makes for easy straightening. The price made it a good value. It does not snag hair the way cheaper irons do.</li>
    <li> Excellent straightener. I honestly think it&#x27;s better than the chi. Great deal! Would definitely recommend to anyone with hard-to-maintain hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and those little short, thin flat irons were ridiculous. They just took too long to use. My new flat iron from Babyliss is long, and 2 inches thick. There is a temperature guage and an on and off switch. So many of these products are on when plugged in. This one doesn&#x27;t burn my hair cause you can use thicker strands. It&#x27;s really worth the price. And, the best part, it really works, I have kind of frizzy hair, in the back, I was using product with it, but it straightened so well I just use shampoo and conditioner. It worked well for me. I have cut back on hair washing, especially during the winter, when it&#x27;s so dry. I can use this flat iron on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair, and it works great. So, I can have straight hair and it looks clean because of not using the products after showering. Really try this, you&#x27;ll be very happy you did.</li>
    <li> hasta ahora muy bien. el producto en buenas condiciones .... ssss ssss ss sss&lt;br /&gt;recomendado este producto 100 por ciento</li>
    <li> My biggest dissappointment is that it does not have auto shut-off.  I didn&#x27;t realize this fact the first time I used it so it was on all day.  I don&#x27;t remember the last time that I had a curling or flat iron had to be turned off manually. Otherwise, this iron heats up fast &amp; flatens well.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I got the flat iron there okay. But can be better. The price was cool. I do a lot for hair I use them but not like that</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, like 20 inches long, and this product works pretty well. It&#x27;s my first BaByliss and I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and not many straighteners work well on it, but I am pleased to say that this one worked perfectly. It heated up quickly and straightened my hair well on the first pass.</li>
    <li> I love how it is light weight. I use mine at 450 and it&#x27;s fast and easy to use, leaving the hair shiny and ready.</li>
    <li> This product was suggested to me by my Dominican beautician, whom I had to temporarily part ways with. It&#x27;s used by professionals, whatever chemicals you use won&#x27;t burn and stain the iron, and it gets very hot!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great price.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> It gets super hot! Very fast too!! Great buy!</li>
    <li> It come really fast and it&#x27;s so amazing I have really thick hair and it straight it so fast and good I love it. Best strightener I have ever had</li>
    <li> My wife said, that it&#x27;s very good</li>
    <li> I love this Flat Iron. 2 inches width and fast heating process makes all the job much easier and faster.&lt;br /&gt;However.... no dual voltage in this one despite what some web pages say....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, it&#x27;s a professionnal iron and it has damaged my hair like no other cheap iron did before...I&#x27;m not gonna buy that brand anymore...</li>
    <li> My daughter liked it but found out that the 2 inch model was not what worked for her hair.  She sent it back but the return was simple.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works quickly, has reduced damage to my hair, and it&#x27;s easy to use. These are my wife&#x27;s word not mine. I bought it for her as a Christmas present this year. She is very happy with it. She has said that it&#x27;s much better than her previous flat iron and that it heats up much quicker.</li>
    <li> So far...so good!  Love it!</li>
    <li> The straighten works well. Better then my old one. It quick fast to warm up don&#x27;t have to wait long does not pull hair or gets sticks</li>
    <li> after a month of use this item does not get hot anymore. Very frustrated since I thought this was a good brand to go with. Will be returning this promptly.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot. Takes several passes to straighten. Will never purchase this brand again. Heard good reviews bit this had been a complete waste of hard earned money :-(!,</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years and used it almost every day! It finally bit the dust only because I had anger issue and threw in across my bathroom where it hit ceramic tile. If I wouldn&#x27;t have spazzed out I&#x27;m sure it would still be kicking!! Great iron, I was impressed with the quality for that price.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have really long hair and this literally takes minutes to style with. It leaves my hair soft, sleek and shiny. You can adjust the temp to the thickness of your hair too. Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I used this flat iron a few times and it damaged my hair.  My hair was not soft at all and was falling like crazy...  I went back to my Conair Infiniti Pro with steam.  Wow what a difference!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this brand. Ceramic heat pads.  Works great.  Gets very hot.</li>
    <li> Large plates are nice for getting a job done quickly. Its nothing outstanding, it works and hasn&#x27;t broken yet, but its not magical.</li>
    <li> It has not come this merchandise and would like information</li>
    <li> Used this flat iron a couple times on my coarse curly hair- heats up quickly and did a good job getting it straight. Pleased with product so far.</li>
    <li> I purchased a less expensive flat iron and got much better results so i sold this as I only used it once and did not like the way it snagged my hair some people may find it preferable due to the name but i found one cheaper that isnt a hair puller. I believe it was a Remington ..</li>
    <li> I am so in love with these , they get any hair type bone straight. I would buy these over and over again</li>
    <li> I usually dont write bad reviews but this flat iron stopped working after 6-7 time use! It was nice and I was happy for first week then it just stopped warming up in middle of straightening my hair. It was on only for 5 min on 325 degree when it just stopped warming up...&lt;br /&gt;I always ignore the bad reviews when there are so many 5 star on a product. I did the same for this one and now I regret it. You migth get lucky and your work longer, but its just matter of luck when this stop working for you one day. These irons are probably didnt pass the QA testing in the factory and that is why they are selling it online.</li>
    <li> Works great on my fine, highlighted, long hair.  Heats up quickly, easy to handle.  Very pleased with it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is a good flat iron, I bought it for my sister and she loved it. In my opinion is too slim</li>
