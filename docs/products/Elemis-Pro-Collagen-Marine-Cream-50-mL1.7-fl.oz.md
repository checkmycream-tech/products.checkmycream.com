      <li>This is a nice facial cream.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>This product is a bit pricey, but I feel it is worth it</li>

      <li>I first was introduced to Elemis while on a cruise with Princess Cruises, who carried the product on their ships.  </li>
      <li>After I almost finished my first jar of it, I couldn&#x27;t help but ordered another jar immediately.</li>
      <li>I first tried this product in the spa on board a cruise ship.</li>
      <li>Good quality; however, I live a mile high &amp; dry, have dry skin, finding a product to buffer &amp; protect one from the elements it is challenging.</li>
      <li>Have been using for several months and do notice improvement in skin texture and fine wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>It not only moisturizes but it improves the feel and texture of my skin; and I think it diminishes the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this product with some other Elemis  products best on market  You will see a difference  must use everyday</li>
    <li> I work in Afghanistan in what must be one of the driest environments in the world.  After only six months here I noticed my skin looking visibly older.  Then I discovered Elemis and I have never looked back.  I now swear by Elemis products!  Although much more expensive than the average face cream, it is definitely worth it.  Smooth, light and non-greasy, it visibly reduces lines and gives long-lasting moisture.</li>
    <li> Amazing skin cream. It&#x27;s expensive but I figure it&#x27;s cheaper than cosmetic surgery. It is moisturizing, evens tone and makes skin look more radiant. Worth the price. iI will last a long time. I started on a cruise too. Amazon has most competitive prices!</li>
    <li> I use it as a moisture lotion morning and night. My mother and two sisters also use it. We are all impressed with how it makes our skin feel and look.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended! I tried it on a cruise spa and felt in love with it so I ordered it as soon as I could! A little bit of cream covers your whole face.</li>
    <li> Marine cream?  That sounded good - until I actually used it.  My face felt tingly at first, which I thought was a good thing.  Then it started feeling warm.  When I looked in the mirror I noticed that my face was turning red and was beginning to develop splotches.  Of course, I washed it off, but it took some time before my skin forgave me.</li>
    <li> The cream is  great and the price is right through Amazon .I have ordered before and will continue to do so again.</li>
    <li> This is THE best day cream!  It is really wonderful for middle aged or more people.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a tube marked &amp;#34;not for resale&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;for professional use only.&amp;#34;  Product is the same excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have consistently used this product for over 5 years.  I am 69 and people say I look 55 years old.</li>
    <li> This is a nice facial cream.  I think it may be a bit overrated as far as the price goes.  I have used other creams that cost less and work probably as well.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure I would go to the expense of purchasing this cream again</li>
    <li> Actually makes a visible difference in my skin.  My husband noticed when I switched. I compared it with other creams -- which did no better than pure Jojoba oil, which is much cheaper.  Most people guess my age as 10 years less than my actual 65.  Love it, despite the price.</li>
    <li> We have used this face cream for several years now and love it. Yes, it is expensive but finding it on Amazon was awesome as I got 2 jars for less than the price of 1 elsewhere. Awesome!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> ordered the 1.7 oz jar but instead received a 1.7 oz tub.  I am skeptical this is the real thing.</li>
    <li> I first was introduced to Elemis while on a cruise with Princess Cruises, who carried the product on their ships.  Thereafter, I would continue to buy it on board but could no find it on land.  Then I happened to be surfing the Net and found it even less expensive than on board the ships.  Now, when needed I order it via Amazon and save a little money by doing so. It makes my lines disappear magically!</li>
    <li> Best cream, a little bit pricy but it last for 9 month. Would recomend to anyone who is looking for something new.</li>
    <li> This product is a bit pricey, but I feel it is worth it a it really makes my skin look and feel refreshed, youthful.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have used for years, rich but not heavy. I would recommande it to my friends</li>
    <li> I first tried this product in the spa on board a cruise ship. Loved it but it was so very expensive. Ten times what I usually paid for face creams. But I splurged and bought it anyway. I have Rosacea and am very careful what I put on my face. However this product is so gentle and you only use a tiny little dollop. Start off with a fraction of how much you feel you’ll need and I think you’ll find out it’s plenty. It really goes a long way. It not only moisturizes but it improves the feel and texture of my skin; and I think it diminishes the fine lines around my eyes and mouth. The jar lasted close to two years and never lost its oomph. When I found it on Amazon for 2/3 the shipboard price I couldn’t resist. It’s still costly but I don’t use a lot of cosmetics and don’t buy expensive clothes or jewelry, so this is my one extravagance. Thank you, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Different presentation.  It arrived in a tube and not a jar.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product and am never disappointed.  Helps keep my skin in balance.  All of Elemis is excellent quality ...</li>
    <li> The best you&#x27;ll ever find and a great value for the money.  Have been using this over 10 years.  Nothing compares.</li>
    <li> I look forward to putting this on my skin twice a day! It&#x27;s great to pamper myself with a light moisturizer! This will last a very long time! It&#x27;s a spa feeling &amp; I love the result too!</li>
    <li> Have been using for several months and do notice improvement in skin texture and fine wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use product.  Probably best product i&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> Product did NOT come in original packing and isn&#x27;t even the real ELEMIS product! I paid for Elemis and have no idea what I received!!!! NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!!!!</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product.  I wish it was supplied in the packaging shown.  It is in a small tub.  I wanted this size for travel.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this face cream.....Love it.....I am 52 and have tried every product out there.....have been using for 2 months and my skin is glowing....do not need to use foundation.  Highly recommended....but expensive.  A little goes a long way when used with the Oxygenating Night Cream.</li>
    <li> wonderful for hydration, but not too heavy or greasy</li>
    <li> Skin feels very hydrated. Glad I started to use this product before winter rolls around.  I use several Elemis products.  This one meets all my expectations.</li>
    <li> On a cruise to Alaska, I first purchased this wonderful cream, Elemis in their beauty shop and now cannot live without it!  It is quite expensive but worth it since you use a tiny bit to cover your whole face.  It is light and fresh and no one believes my age when I tell them.  I owe it all to Elemis and will contimue to buy and use it faithfully.    Any other cream feels too heavy and greasy.  Try it, you will love it!</li>
    <li> This Pro-Collagen Marine Cream smells great and works even better. I have very sesitive skin and can not wear perfummed creams--this cream uses natural fragrances that do not overwhelm the senses. I am a man who does not enjoy smelling like a man which is not to say I like smelling like a woman either--this cream provides a unisex fragrance that both my wife and I enjoy. And being a guy I can tell you ladies that I love this cream on my wife! Give it a try, but be prepared for your husband to sneak some for himself.</li>
    <li> I have acne scars and they&#x27;ve started to flatten out.  I&#x27;m sure if I keep using this product they&#x27;ll diminish further.  At the price for a jar of this cream, though, I might shop around for less expensive collagen cream.</li>
    <li> Good quality; however, I live a mile high &amp; dry, have dry skin, finding a product to buffer &amp; protect one from the elements it is challenging. Good product; although, there are products which cost less...</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different creams, but I really like this one. Makes my skin look and feel awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other products for years. Certain times of the year my skin would get so dry. Someone at work reccomended Elemis and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. My skin never feels dry and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Best facil product I every used&lt;br /&gt;I never broke out.I have tried many other products in the past and had no luck</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price for this face cream, which I&#x27;ve used religiously for years. It&#x27;s apparently working pretty well because my wrinkles seem to be under control.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT IT WAS INTRODUCED TO IN THE SPA ON A HOLLAND AMERICA CRUISE  I PURCHASED SOME ON THE SHIP AND LIKED IT ENOUGH TO REORDER IT.</li>
    <li> Elemis was offered on a cruise ship where I purchased my first Marine cream.  Because of it cost, I procrastinated in purchasing another jar.  Now I&#x27;m glad that I finally broke down and bought the cream.A little goes a long way. I love it and would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this based on the wonderful reviews.  I hesitated to buy it because propylene glycol is the fourth ingredient and it&#x27;s not a chemical that I want in products. I was willing to overlook this because of the rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few weeks my skin was drier, started flaking and looked dull.  I returned it and went back to my previous moisturizer and my skin is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for taking it back.</li>
    <li> Good Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product--feels good when putting on skin.  Gives skin a nice smooth feel.  Has nice smell--not to overpowering.</li>
    <li> This cream is great to use on your face every day. It&#x27;s not greasy and smells good, both of which are important to me.  Hopefully the collagen and other ingredients will keep my skin moisturized and healthy....and hold off the wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I love Elemis products ever since getting my first facial on a cruise ship. This moisturizer makes my skin feel so soft without that greasy feeling. Buying it from Amazon saves me a lot of money too. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Introduced to this product while on a cruise. Love the feel of this light, nourishing moisturizer on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love!  I first got this product on a Carnival cruise and absolutely love it.  So happy to find it on Amazon for almost half the price.  Next time I&#x27;ll buy the larger container and save even more money.</li>
    <li> The Elemis products have made a difference in my skin.  I learned about the product on a cruise while having a facial.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week now and already notice how hydrated my skin is. love it! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I lov this bream.  Seems expensive but you use so little that it lasts months. Used with pro collagen list, I&#x27;ve had amZing results.  Hides eye bags and totally lifts cheek and chin sags.  People ask me why I look so good!</li>
    <li> Feels like silk going on your skin  I&#x27;ve used this for the past three years.. I feel it works well.</li>
    <li> Great products all by Elemis. Pricy, yet unparalled.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully light and lasts all day! I&#x27;ve used other product lines but Elemis is by far the best quality for the price when compared to others,</li>
    <li> This was the counter part to another part of the product line that I bought.  Again, didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin and I haven&#x27;t broke out like this since I was 13.  I gave it time and should have just returned it.  Too late for me now and it just sits in the drawer.</li>
    <li> The cream itself is moisturizing and nourishing, a small amount goes a long way and you see results in a few weeks. Highly recommended to all my friends after the first few months of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived on time, but there was no box for the cream therefore the jar was all scratched up with marks.  There was also no seal on the jar, so unless the buyer is a previous user of this product he/she would not know if it is in fact the actual product. I had one I bought from a department store to compare to and the smells were the same but not the consistency. I have had to use it otherwise because there are no returns allowed. But if you buy from this merchant, you should know the product you are ordering really well because it is impossible to know without it&#x27;s original packaging or some kind of seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved this product from the department store and would purchase it again but not buy from this merchant again.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the Elemis line of skin products while I was on a cruise.  This is my 3rd purchase of this product.  It is light and feels good on my skin.  Buying these products from Amazon is a lot cheaper than buying from the cruise spa specialists.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing and worth every penny !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been too busy to write product review, but I felt I have to share my experience whenever I have a best or worst purchase online.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about it at the beginning but I still wanted to have a try. Guess what? After I almost finished my first jar of it, I couldn&#x27;t help but ordered another jar immediately. Here&#x27;s the reasons,&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s light weight, my first jar lasted more than 2 months and it smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday without expecting much from it , but recently I kept getting compliments on my skin from the people around me. Then I started to notice my skin -- it looks really nicer!&lt;br /&gt;The price is higher than other cream, but I feel like this is worth it.</li>
    <li> wonderful cream for making your skin look and feel good. I would advise anyone that wants younger looking skin to try this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best face cream I have ever used.  Light, smooth, non shiny, youthful appearance.  Unforunately, I can no longer afford it.</li>
    <li> The Elemis products are great.  So glad Amazon is carrying them and at such great prices.  This cream makes your skin so soft &amp; supple and works wonders on my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It goes on well, has a nice fragrance, not sticky, and most of all keeps me looking youthful at age 60.  Is very expensive but it does last longer than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I was introduced to it on a cruise several years ago and have used it ever since.  It&#x27;s perfect for my skin that is fairly dry.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used this product continuously since 2004.  It works great.  Goes on smoothly and makes my skin very soft.  Will last you at least six months.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your skin so soft and moisturized. I tend to have dry skin and this has worked wonders. Absolutely worth the cost. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> nice consistency, sort of a gel cream... I havent noticed a difference in&lt;br /&gt;my skin but i always use a good moisturizer so i think that i would only&lt;br /&gt;notice if i stopped using anything.  I would get this again.</li>
