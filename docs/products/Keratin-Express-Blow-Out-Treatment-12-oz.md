      <li>WOW!</li>

      <li>My hair was silky, smooth, and did what Keratin Complex Blowout claimed to do.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not  flat.</li>

<li> Unfortunately Ansdmt is that the liquid at all different from the original bottles be thick but not this was similar to the water and tried it on my hair did not become soft at all!!!!!!</li>
<li> and I have had the original Express Blow Out a few times in the past for $95.00 to $125.00(worth every cent).  </li>
<li> Then only use the Keratin Complex shampoo and conditioner when you are ready to wash.</li>
<li> Shampoo once, apply the product, blow dry, flat iron, and you are done.</li>
<li> I was very skeptical about ordering since there was so many mixed review</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had other straightening treatments that take hours to process: shampooing, applying product, waiting, blow out, flat iron, shampooing again, blow drying again,  flat ironing again, and then the results only last for a few weeks.</li>
<li> and we both have curly hair (she \\&quot;had\\&quot; dry frizzy hair).  </li>
<li> Could not live without it.</li>
<li> My daughters hair is down her back</li>
<li> Keratin Complex Express Blow Out is different.</li>
<li> it was totally odd.</li>
<li> and i have a lot less curls now.</li>
<li> It is a little hard to do yourself, depending on the length of your hair.</li>
<li> Amazon, first time I&#x27;m totally disappointed in a product you represent and sell.  </li>
<li> I usually get three treatment out of one bottle.</li>
<li> save  at least $100 by not going to a salon.</li>
<li> Bottle also lasts a while I have waist length thick hair and get over 4 treatments out of one bottle.</li>
<li> (WRONG CHOICE).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product !! Thank you!</li>
    <li> The fumes made my eyes water however my hair  looks great. Thanks</li>
    <li> Please do NOT buy this product you will regret it. Shame on this company for selling  an expired product that can really damage you hair. I&#x27;m sure the authentic product from Keratin is a good product.  But agents on Amazon are selling expired products that can cause severe damage to your hair.  I opened the bottle the product did and it did not look right, it was brown and runny I&#x27;m glad I read other reviews on this product and decided not to take a chance on my hair.  Amazon issued a full refund with product return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other straightening treatments that take hours to process: shampooing, applying product, waiting, blow out, flat iron, shampooing again, blow drying again,  flat ironing again, and then the results only last for a few weeks. Keratin Complex Express Blow Out is different. It is literally a one-hour process. Shampoo once, apply the product, blow dry, flat iron, and you are done. And the results lasted about six weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is straightforward enough to do it yourself. Just make sure you have a very high quality blow dryer and flat iron. Use the Keratin Complex clarifying shampoo first, and make sure to keep your hair dry for a couple of days afterwards. Then only use the Keratin Complex shampoo and conditioner when you are ready to wash.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have bought it several times from this seller.  I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This kiratin treatment works quite well. It is a little hard to do yourself, depending on the length of your hair. This gave me the straighter, frizz free look that I wanted. Since then, I have found another brand at the salon that I do like a lot better. The disadvantages of this product are the smell and that it leaves your hair looking greasy during the time you have to leave it in.</li>
    <li> I am a former hair straightener user.  I used the lye based products.  Once I was introduced to this product I have not and will not ever use a hair straightener again. My hair has never looked so good. This is a good in between Keratin treatment (note Express Blowout).  I strongly recommend the regular Coppola Treatment for a loner lasting smoothing treatment.  Follow label instructions.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the peter coppola express blowout which works awesome. This not that product but works ok. Not as good but you still get some of the results.</li>
    <li> I just opened my 4 oz container of this product and it is brown and runny.  Thank goodness I read reviews before I used it  and damaged my hair.  Amazon, first time I&#x27;m totally disappointed in a product you represent and sell.  You need to check this out...product old and out of date.</li>
    <li> Liked it so much I decided to use it in my salon and became certified to use it correctly</li>
    <li> This product works great giving me a smooth blow out when done and keeping the frizz away. Could not live without it.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about ordering since there was so many mixed review and I have had the original Express Blow Out a few times in the past for $95.00 to $125.00(worth every cent).  I went back and forth trying to decide if I wanted to invested in this product and finally gave in.  I have a 9 yr old daughter(never had Keratin therapy) with spiral curls that tends to be very dry/frizzy.  I did exactly what I seen my hair dresser do to my hair and her hair looks AMAZING.  One of her teachers asked me what I did to her hair because she loved it, this was 3 weeks after I had done it.  I did my own hair and it looks like silk, have gotten many compliments.  One thing I did which I also did when my hair dresser applied the Express Blow Out product was left it in our hair for a week.  I never wash it out 8 hours after application, I don&#x27;t know if this makes a difference or not but it worked for my daughter and myself.  I LOVE that I purchased the 12 oz bottle and have enough product left to do our hair 2 more times. My daughters hair is down her back and mine is shoulder length and we both have curly hair (she \\&quot;had\\&quot; dry frizzy hair).  Hope this helps! I will definitely reorder in the future.    PS. Just noticed that the cost went up since 10/29 - increased $6.00 that is a huge hike....WOW!</li>
    <li> Works great. Just want my hair needed. It really controls the frizz but I still have some body and it&#x27;s not  flat.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the results, my hair is defenately less freezy and i have a lot less curls now. very easy to maintain. I will do it again.</li>
    <li> I  bought this product and took it to my stylist (she offered to do it on the side for cheaper than salon price).  Works great!</li>
    <li> I bought 4 bottles of this product, because I used this product for years!! Unfortunately Ansdmt is that the liquid at all different from the original bottles be thick but not this was similar to the water and tried it on my hair did not become soft at all!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was really happy when I saw this bottle for the price. My stylist agreed to do the process in my hair with what I bought here, and I would just pay for cut and color. Right away when she opened the bottle she noticed it was different. It was like REALLY LIQUID chocolate milk! She compared it to her own keratin blowout express, and the one she had was much thicker, and smelled totally different. We went on with the process anyway. (WRONG CHOICE). I knew from the moment she started to blowdry something was different. My hair was SO dry and sticking to the hot comb as she was flat ironing...it was totally odd. Then my ends were fried. We ended up having to CUT OFF 6 INCHES OF HAIR. LISTEN-I&#x27;VE HAD THIS DONE BEFORE IN A SALON, GETTING THE PRODUCT FROM THE SALON. It was totally DIFFERENT!! My hair was silky, smooth, and did what Keratin Complex Blowout claimed to do. I&#x27;m so pissed. I will never buy from here again and I advise you to do the same and get it done in a certified salon.</li>
    <li> My hair is in great condition since I have been using this product. Bottle also lasts a while I have waist length thick hair and get over 4 treatments out of one bottle. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of Coppola Keratin Blowout Treatment. I love it!  My hair is smooth and shines.&lt;br /&gt;Looks just like I stepped out of the salon. Follow the easy instructions and you are set..not to mention you&lt;br /&gt;will save  at least $100 by not going to a salon. I usually get three treatment out of one bottle.</li>
    <li> Was able to do my daughters long hair and save alot of money. Easy to do if you watch instructions on you tube.</li>
