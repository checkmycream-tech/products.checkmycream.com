      <li>The oil smells woodsy and very good.  </li>
      <li>It is ideal for bedtime relaxation or for doing yoga or pilates or stretching or for just sitting while watching TV.</li>
      <li>This is a great relaxing oil.  </li>
      <li>Its also great for swelling and for stretch marks.</li>
      <li>It is calming and great for use before bed time.  </li>
      <li>Until I have more info on its uses and how to use it , it will become another item for my medicine cabinet !!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a very nice vetiver.</li>
      <li>It was a pleasant outdoor wood and</li>
      <li>/&gt;Jojoba oil is a good carrier oil if you plan to use this</li>
      <li>Good oil and felt good to the skin</li>
      <li>The oil seems to be of good quality.</li>
      <li>It also has a good sealing cap.</li>
      <li>I also had read that the scent can be good for treating shock and is calming/</li>
      <li>Very potent.</li>
      <li>It was so familiar, and incredibly calming.</li>
      <li>I have to hold the bottle upside-down for a good 10 seconds to coax a drop out, which is good for someone like me who tends to dispense 10x more than I need of any product.</li>
      <li>but I love these oils!  </li>
      <li>However, I think as a fragrance, this is amazing.</li>
      <li>Still, it would have been nice to have gotten a reply.    </li>
      <li>It seems like a nice oil, the fragrance is just like a bottle I already own of therapeutic grade vetiver oil.</li>
      <li>To be quite honest I had never heard of this product before the Amazon purchase, and as so I had to research what one would even use this for (see below explanation).</li>
      <li>kind of reminds me of damp</li>
      <li>/&gt;(I was provided a free sample, in return for a fair, honest review.)</li>
      <li>Very nice and a tremendous value for vertiver.</li>
      <li>Wonderful, natural oils.  </li>
      <li>I got this for my acne mostly, and it works amazing.</li>
      <li>For full disclosure, I was sent given this product with a request for an honest rating, and an honest rating is what i will give</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I have it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle and have given to my daughters who love it as well.</li>
      <li>I absoluately love the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Okay this is Part One of a 2 part Review.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast and the oil was packaged in bubble wrap, which is great to see.</li>
      <li>rated it 4 stars - because I know the smell/aroma should be improved to be milder so that wider range of customer ethnicity may appreciate it more.  </li>
      <li>BUT i sure wish somebody will make it smell bettre.</li>
      <li>Very much enjoyed the product.</li>
      <li>I will be able to use this to roll onto the kids necks and feet when they need some calming, so it will get used, but - again - I would never have purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Research via internet shows more uses for it like help for arthritis, acne, muscular pains and more.</li>
      <li>A most delicious earthy and woodsy aroma which I actually would use more often than cologne.</li>
      <li>Infusion of roots is a refreshing drink in fever, inflammation and irritability of the stomach.</li>
      <li>One use I found interesting was its ability to keep insects away.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to drop it into my diffuser and I am so glad.</li>
      <li>so much more than if it was on my elbow or someplace else.    </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love the calming effect.</li>
      <li>You should be able to see from the photo I uploaded the color of the product.</li>
      <li>definitely enjoyably masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I always prefer organic oils to non-organic even though I don&#x27;t follow an organic diet at home for the most part.</li>
      <li>This did a much better job of scenting the room.</li>
      <li>I was given a free bottle of this in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>Just add that this product works for so many things and</li>
      <li>(like Aloe with Vitamin E, for example) it is more viscous.</li>
      <li>The sore is still there, getting better, but slowly.&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged nicely and came quickly.</li>
      <li>taste is hmmm, strong but ok.  </li>
      <li>I am happy with this oil, although I had not heard of it prior to being given one in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>I will give a more detailed review in hopefully a week or so</li>
      <li>Great follow through and super fast shipping from this company.</li>
      <li>but overall is a great oil  :)</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; aroma might be strong for some -</li>
      <li>: the scent is incredibly strong at even the smallest amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent...</li>
      <li>that stuff was TOO potent), yet still holds  a cool, earthy scent that may not be sandalwood, but</li>
      <li>I slept more peacefully and my mind was more at rest.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that until I received the bottle and read the fine print.</li>
      <li>I was contacted by the company to try this product for free and review.  </li>
      <li>Goes to show that you should always read the product description - even for items you are sent for free.</li>
      <li>, co-workers have commented on it as well and said they enjoy the smell.</li>
      <li>Thank You for a free sample.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the scent lasted through some light handwashings, and subdued a bit after about 8 hours.</li>
      <li>I was asked to review this product and received a free sample.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Disclaimers: I was asked to review the product and received it from the company for free.</li>
      <li>was considering buying another bottle of the Sandalwood from Caswell-Massey, but considering cost point of Healing Solution&#x27;s Vetiver and how I do enjoy the scent</li>
      <li>What I can say is the smell is fantastic</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to others like it as this is the only type I&#x27;ve ever used but having used it I can say it is a great product.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, packaged nicely.  </li>
      <li>I was sent this for free and asked to review.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice , but that&#x27;s pretty much all I can say !!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is important with India&#x27;s hot, tropical climate.  </li>
      <li>I would not be able to tell you, but some might want to be aware before purchase.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t respond to the original email address.</li>
      <li>great for cracked heels and dry elbows.</li>
      <li>so I looked it up on Wikipedia only to discover the many uses of this amazing grass which this oil is derived from.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to try another oil from this company that isn&#x27;t a blend to see if their 100% pure oils work better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Perfect consistency, not too thick.</li>
      <li>It did not come with any instructions but was packaged well and arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>As for the type of smell many have said earthy and while I notice that in there the strongest sent I notice is more like mint but not sweet more like if mint had bark.</li>
      <li>Got this oil as a free sample and like to say the I&#x27;m very happy with this oil, smell great and is organic which is a big plus for me , the only think the u need to know is the this oil only 10% pure vetiver and 90 % pure jojoba oil</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I have it.few days, but that may have been attributable to the abundance of Halloween candy and the new Borgia season on Netflix.</li>
      <li>Penguin Putnam Inc., New Yorkion of roots is a refreshing drink in fever, inflammation and irritability of the stomach.</li>
      <li>Its good for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>This, it would seem would promote healing because it isn&#x27;t absorbed quickly into the skin.</li>
      <li>I was asked to review this product was very surprised at how much I love it.  </li>
      <li>You just dab a bit on your skin and the aroma helps calm and relax you.  </li>
      <li>did use some topically for acne and skin dryness, and found that I liked how it made my skin feel afterwards.</li>
      <li>I bought a diffuser to enjoy different oil scents and this is my all-time favorite.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I always use some sort of carrier, like coconut oil, grape seed oil, or (of course) joboba oil, which happens to be my personal preferred carrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For full disclosure, I was sent given this product with a request for an honest rating, and an honest rating is what i will give you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is NOT 100% pure vetiver essential oil. It is 10% organic vetiver and 90% organic jojoba oil. I didn&#x27;t notice that until I received the bottle and read the fine print. The product description on Amazon also shows that it&#x27;s a blend, but only in the fine print. That said, for an organic vetiver in organic jojoba oil, the price is not too bad. I would expect to pay about twice as much for a 100% pure vetiver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice vetiver. And the fact that it&#x27;s a blend means that i can keep it by my keyboard and apply it directly to the backs of my hands without having to cut it with a carrier oil first (since that&#x27;s already done for me). Vetiver is a very soothing and grounding oil, and I find it helps me with concentration. Having it next to my keyboard is very helpful!</li>
    <li> Thank you Healing Solutions for sending me this product in return for a review.    I never experienced Vetiver oil before, so this was a welcomed fragrance to try. I didn&#x27;t have a clue about Vetiver (A.K.A. Chrysopogon Zizanioides) so I looked it up on Wikipedia only to discover the many uses of this amazing grass which this oil is derived from. I put some on some scarring I have on the back of my fingers. It is difficult to determine the effectiveness after a short period of usage. But I don&#x27;t think that what this oils&#x27; use is for anyway. However, I think as a fragrance, this is amazing. If you like the smell of the forest after a long rain on a spring morning, this is just like that. No kidding. That&#x27;s what I immediately thought of. A most delicious earthy and woodsy aroma which I actually would use more often than cologne. The small sample I used to test it out, is still emanating its delightful scent after a few hours on. I like this a lot but as far as use as a therapeutic oil, only time will tell.    This 10ml vial will last a long time for not much is needed. It is actually 10% Vetiver oil and 90% Jojoba oil. To call this Vetiver Essential Oil with 90% Jojoba in it says a lot about the power of Vetiver in oil form and in general.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I&#x27;m almost entirely clueless on the subject of essential oils and their supposed properties, so you&#x27;ll want to keep scrolling if you&#x27;re looking for an opinion from someone who actually knows what they&#x27;re talking about. This review is from the perspective of an everyday consumer who received a free product in exchange for an objective review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil smells of pine needles, evergreen bark, and sap. Like when you unpack your gear after a camping trip and your house gets flooded with the scent of the woods. I have a pretty terrible sense of smell, but I&#x27;m still strangely sensitive to perfume-y, artificial scents, so perhaps it speaks to the quality of this oil that it finds that &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; between undetectable and overwhelming. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a subtle smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is extremely viscous. I have to hold the bottle upside-down for a good 10 seconds to coax a drop out, which is good for someone like me who tends to dispense 10x more than I need of any product. I don&#x27;t know about how much you&#x27;d use with an oil diffuser, or in homemade creams and such, but if you&#x27;re just looking for a drop or two to rub your feet or neck with, this bottle should last approximately forever. Personally, I&#x27;d find the smell to be overbearing if I used more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took some advice from the all-knowing internet and rubbed the oil on the bottoms of my feet in the mornings, and I put some on my wrists when I felt my anxiety getting the best of me. Other times, I just took off the cap and took a few whiffs when I noticed I was tense. Of course, without an alternate universe clone of myself who didn&#x27;t use the vetiver on those occasions, there&#x27;s no real way to tell if it made a difference. I&#x27;m pretty cynical about these ~natural remedies that don&#x27;t have a clear therapeutic mechanism, so I&#x27;m not the most open-minded test subject in the world. That said, it certainly didn&#x27;t *not* help. I think I was even less cranky than usual on a few days, but that may have been attributable to the abundance of Halloween candy and the new Borgia season on Netflix. Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m from the Pacific Northwest and I have fond memories of camping and exploring the woods, but if nothing else, this oil definitely brought a smile to my face. I&#x27;m glad I have it.few days, but that may have been attributable to the abundance of Halloween candy and the new Borgia season on Netflix. Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m from the Pacific Northwest and I have fond memories of camping and exploring the woods, but if nothing else, this oil definitely brought a smile to my face. I&#x27;m glad I have it.</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this product was very surprised at how much I love it.  I bought a diffuser to enjoy different oil scents and this is my all-time favorite.  The scent is hard to describe but is deeply fragrant and spicy, makes you think of being in an exotic place, perhaps in the Far East.  Men and women can both enjoy this immensely.  It is ideal for bedtime relaxation or for doing yoga or pilates or stretching or for just sitting while watching TV.</li>
    <li> I got this for my acne mostly, and it works amazing. Cant say im disappointed,  I love it better than any other acne cleanser.  But, its not just for acne, you can use it for many other things.  I definitely recommend it for acne though.</li>
    <li> As stated in the title this product is manufactured in the USA as per the label. The oil blend appears to be of decent quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimers: I was asked to review the product and received it from the company for free. I also find most homeopathic, organic and similar things to be BS. This review is not about the company selling the product or the legitimacy of &amp;#34;essential oils&amp;#34; curing things. It&#x27;s about the product and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I received appears to me to be exactly as described. It is a blend as every other review has mentioned but that is in the description so I was not surprised at all. The oil seems to be of good quality. I used some on my skin with no issue, it left the area soft and had a distinct smell. The smell was not strong but noticeable for about 30 minutes then it became faint for the next few hours. As for the type of smell many have said earthy and while I notice that in there the strongest sent I notice is more like mint but not sweet more like if mint had bark. You should be able to see from the photo I uploaded the color of the product. Since it is 90% jojoba oil, it&#x27;s constancy, as expected, is vegetable oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noteworthy point; per Wikipedia vetiver oil is normally extracted from the root for perfumery and aromatherapy but per the label this product is extracted from vetiver leaf. If this has an effect, positive or negative, on it&#x27;s performance I would not be able to tell you, but some might want to be aware before purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never heard of this oil before I tried it out. It was a pleasant outdoor wood and clean earth smell reminiscent of the frankincense scented oil sent this company also produces. I gather from the company&#x27;s copy that it is intended as a therapeutic item; I did not find it useful as such but did like the scent which rather grows on you over time. it does seem to rehydrate the skin quite well, leaving a noticeable difference between the skin I treated and that I didn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t yet know how long it will last -scent wise, but will edit this post in a month. The amount needed was really quite small, but I just can&#x27;t see using it as a primary moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;  It is a nice change and is subtly different than anything else I have smelled. Give it a try and see what you think!</li>
    <li> This healing oil works really well and fast. I can&#x27;t compare it to others like it as this is the only type I&#x27;ve ever used but having used it I can say it is a great product. The nose guard on my glasses broke off and after I continued wearing them I had to endure the remaining piece of metal digging into my nose instead. I used the oil on the small, painful hole that was forming on the bridge of my nose and it quickly eased the pain and healed it over.    One reviewer described its odor as being like freshly dug dirt and was spot on in that. I might prefer a different scent, although being a guy, I suppose I wouldn&#x27;t want something too girly smelling now, would I? Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered as much if the healing need hadn&#x27;t been so close to my nose where I could smell it so much more than if it was on my elbow or someplace else.    The only downside I have about this product is that, having never used this type of product before, I tried to contact the seller to find out just how a person was to apply this (that is, ingest it orally, apply it topically or what.) After a month I just decided \\&quot;What the heck\\&quot; and applied it topically hoping it was correct.     I know that if a person is going to go out of their way to buy this they&#x27;re going to know how and what to use this stuff for, but I was not such a person. Still, it would have been nice to have gotten a reply.    Still, if you have need of a healing oil or use them regularly and are pretty sure you won&#x27;t have any questions to ask about it, then I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great relaxing oil.  You just dab a bit on your skin and the aroma helps calm and relax you.  I just put a dab on my wrist and take a few whiffs of it.  It is calming and great for use before bed time.  You don&#x27;t need a lot and a few dabs work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> Very nice and a tremendous value for vertiver. Great follow through and super fast shipping from this company.</li>
    <li> this stuff seems to help everything. Its good for my dry skin. And I swear it seemed to help a little on my toenail fungus.&lt;br /&gt;Its great for cracked heels and dry elbows. BUT i sure wish somebody will make it smell bettre. It smells like the last potato in the bag that&#x27;s gone bad...</li>
    <li> Excellent product if you know what you&#x27;re getting. Vetiver Essenitial Oil--like most of the essential oils--has a wide renge of homeopathic uses. While the fragrance, as other reviewers have stated, as a kind of earthy scent, it isn&#x27;t particularly overwhelming, especially if you&#x27;re going to use it in combination with other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that the Healing Solutions bottle contains vetiver oil already mixed with jojoba oil (in a 10-90% formula, respectively). So if you need it undiluted, you&#x27;ll probably want another product. However, this bottle is pharmaceutical grade, so that&#x27;s in its favor; you really shouldn&#x27;t buy any homeopathic solutions or vitamins/supplements that aren&#x27;t. All in all, it&#x27;s exactly as advertised, provided you read the product details (and why wouldn&#x27;t you?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I was provided a free sample, in return for a fair, honest review.)</li>
    <li> Good oil and felt good to the skin</li>
    <li> I received Vetiver Essential Oil for free to try it.  I took it before bed.  Say about 4 drops on a small glass of water.&lt;br /&gt;The taste is hmmm, strong but ok.  I slept more peacefully and my mind was more at rest.&lt;br /&gt;This products passes as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> Got this oil as a free sample and like to say the I&#x27;m very happy with this oil, smell great and is organic which is a big plus for me , the only think the u need to know is the this oil only 10% pure vetiver and 90 % pure jojoba oil so keep that in mind but overall is a great oil  :)</li>
    <li> Okay this is Part One of a 2 part Review. I had not heard of this product. I received an Email asking me to Buy and Review it. I am like many, and thought it could be a fake email and wouldnt &#x27;click the link&#x27;. Id also Never gotten such a request before. I looked it up on here, then I tracked down the Company and sent them the email to see if it was &#x27;real&#x27;, It Was, and they were Incredibly Helpful! There was an issue and I couldn&#x27;t respond to the original email address. It is NOT for internal use, its for Topical massage or a diffuser to make your house smell good. I have chronic pain, and have finally ordered this today. Cant hurt to see if it helps. I am BIG on how a company helps you, they were Easy to reach and Fantastic to deal with. When I receive the product I will let you know how it works/smells. They have assured me the &#x27;glitch&#x27; over Instructions as listed above by another reviewer, will be solved as well.</li>
    <li> Very much enjoyed the product. Looking forward to trying the others.</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this product by Healing Solutions and as such received the product to review. To be quite honest I had never heard of this product before the Amazon purchase, and as so I had to research what one would even use this for (see below explanation). With all that said, this is an oil that can be used as a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; fragrance to helping with what ails you.  I agree with the smell assessment below &amp;#34;earthy like newly tilled soil, and balsam-woody&amp;#34; which is a step up on what I normally smell like. I actually like the smell - the juries still out on whether or not my wife will feel the same. My take is the fragrance grows on you. I can also verify that it helps normalize oily skin and clear acne, replenishes moisture in dry and dehydrated skin, has a rejuvenation effect on mature skin (a healthy glow). I also find that the aroma helps to combat anxiety, stress, tension and nervousness, producing a much calmer me - hey I am still from New York - but whatever works right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is vetiver?  It&#x27;s a grass native to India that grows in bushes up to 4&#x27;x4&#x27;, related to lemon grass, as you can tell when you smell it. The grass&#x27;s long, thin roots that they distill—is infinitely more interesting though: deep, shadowed, astringent, earthy like newly tilled soil, and balsam-woody (Burr, C).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vetiver oil purportedly balances the activity of the sebaceous oil glands, has deodorizing properties,and helps normalize oily skin and clear acne. It replenishes moisture in dry and dehydrated skin and has a rejuvenation effect on mature skin, as well as cuts / wounds / irritated and inflamed skin. When used regularly during pregnancy, vetiver oil reportedly prevents stretch marks. The oil strengthens the central nervous system, and is helpful in overcoming depression, insomnia, anxiety, stress, tension and nervousness (Wilson, 1995).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When locally applied in rheumatism, lumbago, headache, sprain, it is a relieving embrocation. Infusion of roots is a refreshing drink in fever, inflammation and irritability of the stomach. Some people use vetiver oil as aphrodisiac (Wilson, 1995).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;References&lt;br /&gt;Burr C. 2011. The Best Vetiver Fragrances for GQ Men Guide.

    <li> Wonderful, natural oils.  Gave one review prior and don/t know where it went but I love these oils!  Will definitely be ordering more in the future</li>
    <li> I had never heard of vetiver before this, but after reading the reviews about how it smelled I knew I had to get it. I also had read that the scent can be good for treating shock and is calming/soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is very small, about the size of an adult thumb. It comes with a plastic piece int he neck of the bottle that will only allow a tiny drop out at a time (this is removable.) It also has a good sealing cap. I say this because you would NOT want to spill this: the scent is incredibly strong at even the smallest amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent...I read all about it and thought I was ready for it. But, I wasn&#x27;t. And I hear—like wine—everyone smells something different in vetiver. When I tried a tiny drop rubbed onto the back of my hand, I spent a full 30 minutes smelling it again and again as I worked around the house. It was so familiar, and incredibly calming. It smelled like memories, no joke. It conjured up all those camping trips I had as a kid in the woods. To me it reminds me of the woods, earthy, woodsy, a bit of leather and some moss. Yet, there are notes of woodsy spices, like cinnamon. It&#x27;s like nothing I have ever smelled before. And I love it (in small doses.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the scent lasted through some light handwashings, and subdued a bit after about 8 hours. But, it definitely lingered a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you try this for the first time, I highly recommend you simply tip the bottle onto a finger (a fraction of a drop) and rub it into the back of your hand. That way you can get a feel for the smell as you work, but not have it too close to your face. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this product and had one sent to me for free.&lt;br /&gt;I was anxious to try it and I googled what you should use vetiver oil for.&lt;br /&gt;One of the things mentioned was for healing on the skin.  I had a small sore on my face for sometime and I applied the oil two or three times a day.  I can&#x27;t say that it has worked miracles.  The sore is still there, getting better, but slowly.&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged nicely and came quickly.</li>
    <li> It smell like the wet bark of a tree after a rainy day - like the scent you smell as you walk in the woody back yard of a farm house.  With that said, its calming and soothing at the same time.  I recently used it to massage over my aching lower back - and it really help.  Research via internet shows more uses for it like help for arthritis, acne, muscular pains and more. The &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; aroma might be strong for some - so I suggest you test a small amount first before using for any purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it 4 stars - because I know the smell/aroma should be improved to be milder so that wider range of customer ethnicity may appreciate it more.  Don&#x27;t change the smell -just make it milder.</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this product and received a free sample. Other reviewers have mentioned the aroma  of this oil--I&#x27;ll just say, I like it and find it stimulating. The oil itself is very rich and unlike other oils I&#x27;ve tried in the past (like Aloe with Vitamin E, for example) it is more viscous. Because of this it remains longer on the surface of the skin and doesn&#x27;t immediately disappear, like aloe and vitamin e solution I&#x27;ve used. This, it would seem would promote healing because it isn&#x27;t absorbed quickly into the skin. Just think ofa  &amp;#34;band-aid&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll get what I mean. I am using the product on an area where I have scaring and an area with a skin abrasion. I am also using it on age lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that there is some improvement and healing of the skin abrasion and have not come to any conclusion about the improvement in the appearance of the scar tissue. I will continue my evaluation and update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion I&#x27;d make is that you do need (a) Instructions on how to use (b) suggested uses (c) the manufacturer should do a bunch of field trials and document results. (d) spell out the benefits</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newby when it comes to essential oil &amp; its uses. Vetiver Essential Oil is new to me. I did some research to learn how to use it.  Vetiver is used quite a bit in India. One use I found interesting was its ability to keep insects away. I&#x27;m sure this is important with India&#x27;s hot, tropical climate.  It has a soothing, cooling effect &amp; calms and pacifies all sorts of inflammation.  It helps get rid of scars (stretch marks, chicken pox scars &amp; burn scars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Organic Source Net: \\&quot;It stops the growth of Staphylococcus Aureus which is the bacteria responsible for causing sepsis and eliminates them. It is totally safe for this oil to be applied externally on wounds...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vetiver has a woody, earthy scent...kind of reminds me of damp soil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00O13M70I Vetiver Essential Oil | 100% Organic Therapeutic Grade]] is a blend; 10% vetiver essential oil &amp; 90% jojoba oil.  Jojoba oil is considered to be the premium carrier for essential oils. Review sample provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% satisfaction guaranteed</li>
    <li> This is several bottles later and I have already given a long review.  Just add that this product works for so many things and it is the nicest, smoothes oil and takes just a few drops to apply so isn&#x27;t as expensive as you might think.  I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle and have given to my daughters who love it as well.</li>
    <li> Not really sure how to rate this product , I was asked to review this product , and it was sent very fast !! Other than that I&#x27;m not sure ?? They do not send any instructions as to how to use this product , not sure if it is for topical use or ingestion ?? The smell is nice , but that&#x27;s pretty much all I can say !! Until I have more info on its uses and how to use it , it will become another item for my medicine cabinet !!  Your marketing strategy obviously does not include what this product is used for !! Would I recommend this product to anyone , without anymore info , my answer would be , no , i would not !!</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers have said I to I was asked to review this product and really had no idea what it was. My review will be short because I can&#x27;t give too much of detailed review due to only having it for a few days. What I can say is the smell is fantastic, co-workers have commented on it as well and said they enjoy the smell. As another reviewer said it helps with acne so right now that is what I am trying out. I will give a more detailed review in hopefully a week or so when I start seeing a difference.</li>
    <li> This one is new to me.  I read that 90% of western perfumes contain vetiver oil as an ingredient, which shows how well it mixes with other scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still getting used to it.  It&#x27;s a subtle aroma, and I find that 2 or 3 droplets are needed, as opposed to some of the stronger scents where 1 droplet is more than enough.  I use it in potpourris around the home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though subtle, I have already noticed that the pleasant scent lingers with me.  Even after I left the room where I was using it, I still had the vetiver scent in my head. That&#x27;s a sign that I am going to fall for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Healing Solution line is also new to me, but after trying 4 of their oils now, I can say that they are of the highest quality.</li>
    <li> I was given a free bottle of this in exchange for an honest review. First of all, shipping was fast and the oil was wrapped securely in bubble wrap and shipped in a bubble envelope. The vetiver essential oil is cut with jojoba, 10%-90%. So if you&#x27;re looking for just a bottle of uncut vetiver then look elsewhere. But, if you are uncomfortable with cutting your own oil for massage or whatever you&#x27;re using it for, then maybe this is the right thing for you. I received a 10 ml bottle, which is two teaspoons. Essential oils go a long way, but as it is already diluted in jojoba oil (when an oil is cut like this it is called &amp;#34;absolute&amp;#34; ), it won&#x27;t go as far as if you bought an uncut bottle and mixed your own. When buying essential oils you need to be aware of what it means when a seller states something is &amp;#34;100% (as in all of the product), or 100% (as in all of the essential oil used in the product). There&#x27;s nothing wrong with buying oils that are absolute, or already cut, most really rare or expensive oils are mainly sold that way, just make sure you are sure of what you&#x27;re getting.&lt;br /&gt; It seems like a nice oil, the fragrance is just like a bottle I already own of therapeutic grade vetiver oil. I always prefer organic oils to non-organic even though I don&#x27;t follow an organic diet at home for the most part. This is because essential oils are such a concentrated form of whatever plant they are coming from that any pesticides that are used on the plant are going to also be concentrated in your oil. That isn&#x27;t to say that if you don&#x27;t buy organic you are buying pesticides, but you can at least know that if you DO buy organic that you aren&#x27;t buying pesticides. For those who would like to know, this oil has been steam distilled from the vetiver plant&#x27;s leaf. It is 10% organic, therapeutic grade essential oil and 90% Jojoba oil. The Latin name is: chrysopogon zizanioides.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve used several brands of essential oils. One of my favorites is sold through multi-level marketing and while I like the product I don&#x27;t like the structure. I&#x27;ve been looking for a therapeutic oil that lives up to that grade. Healing Solutions is new to me, but I thought I&#x27;d give the brand a try. Upon receiving the Vetiver oil, the first thing I did was smell it. You can smell the freshness of this steam-distilled product. I had read that Veitiver can ease pain. I have some residual spinal cord damage that has led to pain in two toes of my right foot. It&#x27;s not bad pain, but it&#x27;s nerve pain and is annoying when I go to bed. I thought I&#x27;d try the Vetiver topically on my toes and found that a single drop actually relieved the nerve sensations! Wow, I hadn&#x27;t expected that. This is truly therapeutic grade. And I&#x27;m now a fan of Vetiver!</li>
    <li> I was contacted by the company to try this product for free and review.  It did not come with any instructions but was packaged well and arrived quickly.  I absoluately love the fragrance.  It is very soothing like an essential oil you might have used during a massage.  I googled info on the product to find out its uses.  They only way I have had a chance to use it so far is for relaxing by putting some on my wrists and chest before bedtime.  I look forward to checking out some other uses.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this oil, although I had not heard of it prior to being given one in exchange for an honest review. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell that everyone reports, but it&#x27;s starting to grow on me after a couple days use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been attempting to use it to help reduce anxiety and restlessness. I found that burning it in my oil burner didn&#x27;t give off a strong enough scent for the room so I boiled a small pot of water, added some drops of this, then let it simmer. This did a much better job of scenting the room. I&#x27;m not sure how helpful it is- I&#x27;m somewhat of a skeptic so I don&#x27;t want to make any medical claims without feeling fairly sure it was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use some topically for acne and skin dryness, and found that I liked how it made my skin feel afterwards.</li>
    <li> I like the heavy earthy fragrance:) Some people don&#x27;t like the woody smoky aroma at all. Thank You for a free sample. Just a few drops will do. Perfect consistency, not too thick. I love the calming effect. It helps me to relax &amp; restores my general well being. I find peace &amp; tranquility when using it during the day where there&#x27;s loud noise &amp; chaos. To me it truly a healing solution. I&#x27;ll continue to use it along with a lavender spritz. They compliment each other well. It may work differently on different people, but it won&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.  We all need tranquil moments in our lives to rejuvenate our soul in order to live harmoniously in the chaotic world. Thank You Vetiver Essential Oil for it&#x27;s property.</li>
    <li> 10% vetiver + 90% jojoba is not &amp;#34;100% pure&amp;#34;. The oil smells like dirt to me. I use a different brand of essential oils and their vetiver smells much better. I did test this oil on a scar and unfortunately, there wasn&#x27;t a ton of improvement after 2x per day application with additional carrier oil. I&#x27;d love to try another oil from this company that isn&#x27;t a blend to see if their 100% pure oils work better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and the oil was packaged in bubble wrap, which is great to see.</li>
    <li> It adds a woodsy freshness to essential oil mixes. Not like pine but just woodsy and fresh. That&#x27;s the only way I can think to describe it. I like it a lot. Very potent. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> When I received i didnt know what it was used for so i did some research on the internet about this vetiver oil and some of the uses are to speed up the process of scars. Its also great for swelling and for stretch marks. Thats the info i found on the internet. I barely started using this oil product about 3 days ago on one of the scars i have on my arm. Havent yet seen a difference but when i do i will edit my review for a 5 star!! The smell of this oil, it is fresh it smells kind of when you pull out a plant with its roots and smell the fresh recently water roots. The product arrived pretty fast. Awesome seller and i hope to see some improvement on my scar!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, packaged nicely.  The oil smells woodsy and very good.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was sent this for free and asked to review. Goes to show that you should always read the product description - even for items you are sent for free. The product was shipped fine - packaged better than other oils I have ordered through the mail. When it arrived, I opened it and smelled it and it smelled different from all other vetiver oils I have ever gotten in the past, but I didn&#x27;t take much time to examine it right away as I was off to work. Fast forward to today - I thought I need to review it, so I&#x27;ll put some into my essential oil diffuser and check it out. Good thing that the small cap that is supposed to let you pour it in drops was made incorrectly. I wasn&#x27;t able to drop it into my diffuser and I am so glad. I went to look for a needle or pin to open up the dropper and while going, I read the ingredients. This is not a pure essential oil. It is an essential oil blend - 10% vetiver, 90% jojoba. I would never have bought this at the price that it is right now $9.95 because there is another brand of oils that I trust and buy all of the time which has a 100% pure vetiver oil in a 15 ml size for only $12. Once I saw that the oil is blended, I abandoned my original plan of putting it into the diffuser and instead took it out of the bottle in which it came and placed it into a rollerball bottle that I usually use to dispense my own blends. I will be able to use this to roll onto the kids necks and feet when they need some calming, so it will get used, but - again - I would never have purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The vetiver smell is not overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oil is a good carrier oil if you plan to use this topically&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not a pure essential oil&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it is a blend is not specified in the name or in the top description - you have to scroll down and really look to find that information</li>
    <li> I definitely appreciate the blend of Vetiver with Joboba Oil - putting pure plant extract oils on your skin WITHOUT a carrier oil can lead to some bad things, muy no beuno.  Honestly, I always use some sort of carrier, like coconut oil, grape seed oil, or (of course) joboba oil, which happens to be my personal preferred carrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Caswell-Massey bottle of Sandalwood Cologne had finally hit that limit of simply being too old and had turned into total &amp;#34;Ick&amp;#34;.  Serendipity would have it that I was asked to review this Vetiver later that same day I had regrettably tossed that old bottle.  Nice thing about this is that it&#x27;s not alcohol based like many colognes (and thus the aged turning) and already has the carrier oil already mixed, so it&#x27;s a simple direct application for exactly the kind of body scent I like.  The scent is demure overall, quite unlike a patchouli/sandalwood oil I had tried (woof, that stuff was TOO potent), yet still holds  a cool, earthy scent that may not be sandalwood, but definitely enjoyably masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was considering buying another bottle of the Sandalwood from Caswell-Massey, but considering cost point of Healing Solution&#x27;s Vetiver and how I do enjoy the scent, this is where I shall be coming in the future.  :)</li>
    <li> a little too  green for me</li>
