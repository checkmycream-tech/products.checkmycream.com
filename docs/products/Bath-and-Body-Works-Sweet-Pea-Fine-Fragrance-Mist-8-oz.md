      <li>Very well packaged.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am throwing this out and going to the B&amp;BW by my house to purchase the new formula that I was expecting.</li>
      <li>One issue I have had in the past is accidentally using too much, which is not an issue with this because it is so light and inoffensive.</li>
      <li>fragrance is not true but I guess Sweet Pea is elusive to perfume makers.</li>
      <li>I generally prefer fruity scents to florals, but this one is the exception.</li>

<li> I would definitely purchase other items with this scent.</li>
<li> It needs to be reapplied every so often, like once every three hours, but that&#x27;s to be expected with a body mist.</li>
<li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
<li> Description and delivery were as expected!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the same smell for the past 6 years.</li>
<li> It got here in less then a week, and smelled exactly as expected.</li>
<li> You are getting the cheapo alcoholy smelling formula previously used in an ugly hot pink bottle with NO ingredients label or anything.</li>
<li> i dont like this product because i dont like wait to lone time for a product to small</li>
<li> some dude just took a trip to B&amp;BW, bought the oldest version possible in an ugly container, ripped off the label, and stuck it in a used box with some ducktape on it.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews?</li>

    <li> This product is a genuine bath and body works sweet pea fragrance. It came new, and filled up all the way. I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews? It got here in less then a week, and smelled exactly as expected. It&#x27;s a great floral scent, not too perfumed or heavy. It needs to be reapplied every so often, like once every three hours, but that&#x27;s to be expected with a body mist. It&#x27;s not perfume, so stop expecting perfume results people....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a nice scent, and I&#x27;ve got compliment on it. Guys love this sweet, not to heavy scent.</li>
    <li> I love Sweet Pea. As a teen, I just fell in love with it. I received a Sweet Pea gift set from my Hubby for Mother&#x27;s Day. I was running low so decided to purchase a bottle on Amazon. Well, it got here, shipping was super fast! But when I sprayed a bit on... It had an extra scent that was a bit off. It smelled like alcohol and Idk what else. I just know that it didn&#x27;t smell like what was purchased from Bath And Body Works. I gave it 3 stars because the smell is tolerable and it doesn&#x27;t actually stink... But I&#x27;ll just go to the actual store to purchase this scent.</li>
    <li> Its a very good product, i gift the lotion  to my girlfriend and she are very happy with the bath and body works sweet</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> love and smells great</li>
