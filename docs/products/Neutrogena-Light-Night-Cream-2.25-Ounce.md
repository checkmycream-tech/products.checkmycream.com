      <li>I&#x27;m really impressed by the Neutrogena products and the prices are so much saner than Clinique.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a couple people said it should be a good night cream for oily skin since it&#x27;s light.</li>
      <li>and i think the fragrance is too strong!</li>
      <li>Very light.</li>
      <li>Very light, but softens my skin well.  </li>
      <li>Also love radiance moisturizer w/ spf 15 for daytime.</li>
      <li>and I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love neutrogena products, and this did not disappoint.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>However after using this every night for a month I have noticed that my skin seems softer, more even, and generally more moisturized.</li>
      <li>Love the way this leaves my skin feeling..</li>
      <li>It is a lighter and non greasy cream, which is what I was looking for, and I am pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I used Neutrogena for many years when I was in China.</li>
      <li>and I will keep buying more.</li>
      <li>I love to take it with me when we travel.</li>
      <li>This feels lovely going on (soothing, silky texture); it&#x27;s non-irritating (to me) and unscented.  </li>
      <li>After trying many tgat would just leave my face feeling greasy</li>
      <li>Love it love love it.</li>
      <li>I.&lt;br /&gt; have had dry skin for many years and tried many moisterisers and this one is the best.</li>
      <li>This cream moisturizes and gives me a very clean glow.  </li>
      <li>, I get many compliments from people my own age, they tell me I have great looking facial skin.</li>
      <li>It seems like a pretty good moisturizer for people with non oily skin.</li>
      <li>Works wonderfully also as a day cream for those of us with dry winter skin.  </li>
      <li>The products are what they claim to be, and this particular night cream, I would say, is as good as or better than any of the Cilnique overnight products.  </li>
      <li>I love Neutrogena&#x27;s Light Night Cream and have been using if for years.</li>
      <li>This is a great night cream for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>So, I went on line and bought as many jars as were available.  </li>
      <li>The most important is that the price is cheaper than in China.</li>
      <li>Nice fresh scent.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years &amp; have found it perfect for my skin type &amp; to be priced fairly, far below comparable creams to be found in department store brand conscious names .</li>
      <li>Very light face cream that seems to get absorbed into the skin and does not lie greasy spots on pillowcases and can be used as a daytime moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Light weight.</li>
      <li>Either someone filled a Neutrogena jar with a cheaper product, or this had been sitting on a shelf somewhere for twenty years.</li>
      <li>So smooth and</li>
      <li>Moisturizer feels silky and goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>A decent light noght cream I mix with rose hip oil.</li>
      <li>I will be 70 next week &amp; am told constantly that my skin is beautiful, so I feel I am a good advertisement for Neutorgena.</li>
      <li>No break out and it feels clean not greasy.</li>
      <li>and I still feel clean and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>If you have dry skin and aren&#x27;t prone to breakouts and don&#x27;t have any fine lines  yet, this might be a good cream, but not for me.</li>
      <li>this one actually feels good.</li>
      <li>that was a bit more intense than a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>- look at it as an opportunity to use more intense products like serums on targeted areas.  </li>
      <li>I am only 33 and have had mostly oily skin all my life, but my cheeks are just needing more and this does the job.</li>
      <li>I have used Neutrogena Light Night Cream very happily for many years, lately buying it through Amazon because it&#x27;s no longer available on my local store shelves.</li>
      <li>Works much better than the high priced department store products.</li>
      <li>Again, too many chemicals are not good for your skin, so while sunscreen is a great invention and allows us to go outdoors without being burned from damaging ultraviolet rays, it should still be used sparingly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
      <li>It does not clog my pores and my skin is softer, smoother and overall has a nice moisturized glow to it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth the money</li>
      <li>i love it for my annoyingly sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It has a pretty mild creamy smell to it.  </li>
      <li>I can see the difference and the price is right.</li>
      <li>It works and the price is right.  </li>
      <li>Love this product, but it&#x27;s so much easier to order it here and have it sent to me directly than it is to go to the store and hope they have some in stock!</li>
      <li>For the most part I only need night cream in the wintertime.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time using it</li>
      <li>Its fabulous for people with sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Most cream manufacturers put strong smelling perfumes in their products &amp; I prefer this cream which has no fragrance &amp; does not feel heavy or greasy on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I certainly will buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>For the price this is an excellent way to keep your skin soft, especially during harsh winter months.</li>
      <li>For a light night cream, this cream moisturized far more than I expected.</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m just using some acne spot-treatment cream and a simple eye cream for hydration, and this clean cream allows those things to do their work without having conflicting chemicals.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a while, and it works ok on insanely dry skin.</li>
      <li>skin type is pretty oily too, and I live in a hot, humid area.  </li>
      <li>Neutrogena Light Night Cream IS in fact light, it goes on easy, you only need a little bit at a time, and guess what?  </li>
      <li>I did not find it light as advertised ; in fact it left my face feeling very greasy after applying it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light enough to use at night but you could also use it during the day.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t cause me to break out but still provided so much moisture</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing without being greasy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I can ever find that isn&#x27;t greasy, that goes on so smoothly and that doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen in it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great light night cream.  It is not greasy at all.  I would prefer it in a tube or pump but still like it.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my favorite moisturizer. It&#x27;s worth every cent. It feels great, lasts all day, and no more dry skin.</li>
    <li> Price was good and i couldn&#x27;t buy it locally</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I bought this product that it did not suit me at all !!! I did not find it light as advertised ; in fact it left my face feeling very greasy after applying it. Plus for some reason my skin started to itch after I wore it. So now I am using it on my hands and legs. What a waste !! I have used other Neutrogena products - their moisturizer, oil free with SPF moisturizer , the ultra sheer sun screen etc and have never had a problem with any of them. This was the first disappointment from neutrogena for me. Plus I now have to hunt again for a good hydrating night time moisturizer ! :(</li>
    <li> Great cream, have used it for years. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT.  I AM 75 YEARS YOUNG AND IT FITS MY NEEDS AND I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT.</li>
    <li> For a light night cream, this cream moisturized far more than I expected. When I applied to my face, pretty instantly it seemed to improve any crepiness I had on my eyelids. I have begun Menopause and have seen some changes in my skin and am searching to try some new products than the ones that I currently use. I have read some high reviews on Neutrogena, so I decided to try their brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for 2 days now and really like the look and feeling it gives my skin overall. It does not clog my pores and my skin is softer, smoother and overall has a nice moisturized glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is that it is sensitive to the &amp;#34;around the eye&amp;#34; area. It does not sting my eyes and I can put it directly on my lids and as close to my eye as I want. A lot of moisturizers will cause my eyes to burn or water and this one does not.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old daughter uses at night and loves it - it doesn&#x27;t give her pimples.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past few years and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other drug store creams that do fancy things like anti-aging or helps with sun damage, tightening, brightening, etc.  They all irritated my skin or had little effect.  This cream moisturizes and gives me a very clean glow.  I don&#x27;t feel greasy, there is no stinging, tingling or itching.  It&#x27;s just moisturizer doing its thing.&lt;br /&gt;My skin type is pretty oily too, and I live in a hot, humid area.  Despite the weather and all that, this doesn&#x27;t leave my face like an oil slick in the morning and I still feel clean and moisturized.  So if you have dry skin and you want to use this, just adjust the amount of cream you use accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;The lack of extras in this cream may be considered a negative to some people - look at it as an opportunity to use more intense products like serums on targeted areas.  Right now I&#x27;m just using some acne spot-treatment cream and a simple eye cream for hydration, and this clean cream allows those things to do their work without having conflicting chemicals.  I like it, I&#x27;m sure other people like that too.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to everything and HATE face cream. Severe eczema and lupus forced me to find one I could use. Very light. Absolutely no irritation or burning. The only face cream I ever use.</li>
    <li> Due to budgetary constraints, I had to find a cheaper night cream.  I&#x27;m 43 with combo, slightly sensitive skin that&#x27;s blackhead-prone and subject to the occasional pimple.  For the most part I only need night cream in the wintertime.  This feels lovely going on (soothing, silky texture); it&#x27;s non-irritating (to me) and unscented.  However, whether I apply a lot or a little, I wake up with extremely greasy skin that still feels somewhat dry and parched underneath, and the blackheads are worse.  I&#x27;m guessing that sesame oil doesn&#x27;t agree with me.  It&#x27;s hit or miss with natural oils--my face loves avocado and almond oils but olive and soybean oils make me break out.  Your mileage may vary!  I will be using this up on my neck and decollete, where it works beautifully--lovely glow and no greasiness--though n.b., I detect a slight scent of sesame oil under my turtlenecks and recommend you don&#x27;t apply this under silk and dry-cleanables.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Fast delivery and quality. I recommend this product to all.  If you want a nice stuff, this is the best choice!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years &amp; have found it perfect for my skin type &amp; to be priced fairly, far below comparable creams to be found in department store brand conscious names . Most cream manufacturers put strong smelling perfumes in their products &amp; I prefer this cream which has no fragrance &amp; does not feel heavy or greasy on my skin.  I will be 70 next week &amp; am told constantly that my skin is beautiful, so I feel I am a good advertisement for Neutorgena.</li>
    <li> Perfect weight for my skin. No break out and it feels clean not greasy. Worth the money and I will keep buying more.</li>
    <li> This night cream is perfect for night or day use. I.&lt;br /&gt; have had dry skin for many years and tried many moisterisers and this one is the best. I certainly will buy more in the future. Very excellent value for money</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know the life of these products but there is no expiry date or best before date on this.</li>
    <li> Unscented, completely benevolent and fast absorbing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two years now. I can see the difference and the price is right. Works much better than the high priced department store products.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product and the service.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena&#x27;s Light Night Cream and have been using if for years. It&#x27;s so hard to find a face cream that is fragrance-free, but this cream contains no scent. It&#x27;s perfect for after a shower. Gentle on your skin, yet the moisture is long-lasting. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 10 years.  I was upset to find out that the manufacturer was discontinuing it and had not provided a replacement product.  So, I went on line and bought as many jars as were available.  Hopefully, they will last me until I can identify a replacement product.</li>
    <li> I am 59 years old with very dry skin and I love this product.  Moisturizer feels silky and goes on smoothly.  Nice fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this reading how good it is for oily acne prone skin. Not the best for oily skin. Makes my skin feel sticky and made me breakout in the morning. Stick to the cerave products for acne/oily skin. It seems like a pretty good moisturizer for people with non oily skin. Gave it to my brother to use and he likes it.</li>
    <li> My derm says when you run out of your face products, use Neutrogena.  This face cream is great.  It works and the price is right.  I love to take it with me when we travel.</li>
    <li> I used Neutrogena for many years when I was in China. I like it. My skin is sensitive. After trying many other creams, only the Neutrogena fits me. The most important is that the price is cheaper than in China.</li>
    <li> Very light, but softens my skin well.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it is light and your face doesn&#x27;t feel like an oil slick. Its fabulous for people with sensitive skin and I would definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to fragrances and this is one of the few face creams I can tolerate.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it!</li>
    <li> My skin loves this stuff. Have softer smoother skin as a result.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  It&#x27;s light enough to use at night but you could also use it during the day.  I love neutrogena products, and this did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a couple people said it should be a good night cream for oily skin since it&#x27;s light. However, it&#x27;s really not light. It feels greasy and thick on my face, even though I just use a tiny dab. I can still feel it on my face when I wake up. I also don&#x27;t think it did much to help my skin. If you have dry skin and aren&#x27;t prone to breakouts and don&#x27;t have any fine lines  yet, this might be a good cream, but not for me.</li>
    <li> I am 24 with combo skin but incredibly dry skin around my nose. I had been using an expensive department store moisturizer at night and i felt like i used it correctly and frequently and my skin was still red and dry. I have used this 2 nights now and i wake up and my skin is baby soft and hardly any redness! Amazing!!! Wish i found this sooner. Also love radiance moisturizer w/ spf 15 for daytime.</li>
    <li> My skin is very prone to breakouts, but after months of using this product I&#x27;m very happy. Not only does it not cause breakouts, my skin is visibly hydrated and dewy (without greasiness) when I wake up in the morning.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs a good odorless hypoallergenic cream when skin needs moisture alone or on top of your serum or retinal cream and this is a great one.</li>
    <li> I use this almost every night. It is a lighter and non greasy cream, which is what I was looking for, and I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This does the job just  as well as pricier department store brands.  It is very moisturizing without being greasy&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price</li>
    <li> Absorbs after a couple of minutes and makes my skin feel really soft and plush.  I think it is helping my complexion.  It has a pretty mild creamy smell to it.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena Light Night Cream very happily for many years, lately buying it through Amazon because it&#x27;s no longer available on my local store shelves. Previously, no problem. This time I opened the padded envelope to find a jar with no box. This seemed odd, but I kept it anyhow. Today when I applied the cream, it felt like oil on my face, drying quickly into an uncomfortable film. The color is yellowish, not the usual white. It smells yucky. FAIL. Either someone filled a Neutrogena jar with a cheaper product, or this had been sitting on a shelf somewhere for twenty years.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just received a bad one, but it smells awful and has a off white color.  I used it 3 times and couldn&#x27;t put it on my face again.</li>
    <li> Great for my face. Light weight. Moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably been using this product for the last 20 years after swimming.  I have been a swimmer all my life, usually in chlorinated pools.  My face gets very dry after swimming.  Regular moisturizers would do almost nothing.  I always shower after a swim and needed something afterwards that was a bit more intense than a moisturizer.  I started using this and it is just the ticket. It soaks in and brings my face back to normal. It&#x27;s the only time I use it.  It might be a bit too greasy other times.</li>
    <li> In my early 20&#x27;s I noticed some genetically-influenced skin issues (thanks mom!) and started attempting to proactively deal with the inevitable. After trying many dark under eye creams, dry skin salves, and beginning wrinkle lotions, and realizing that none of them do anything, I moved to just a basic skin care regiment and let nature do what it wanted to do (to a degree). While other people apparently had a lessening of under eye darkness, I didn&#x27;t notice a change other than what sleeping more every night fixed. However after using this every night for a month I have noticed that my skin seems softer, more even, and generally more moisturized. For the price this is an excellent way to keep your skin soft, especially during harsh winter months.</li>
    <li> Clinique was my go-to brand for 30+ years.  I always found their products the purest and never had any complaints, until recently when they began to discontinue some products, and change the original formulas on others.  My skin responded badly to these changes and the prices are bordering on the ridiculous.  Neutrogena is now my go-to brand.  The products are what they claim to be, and this particular night cream, I would say, is as good as or better than any of the Cilnique overnight products.  I say it may be better because it is not gloppy or heavy.  I&#x27;m really impressed by the Neutrogena products and the prices are so much saner than Clinique.</li>
    <li> it is good for me and i think the fragrance is too strong! but it is still a good thing!</li>
    <li> I like the small amount of cream that makes your skin feel so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Light Night Cream IS in fact light, it goes on easy, you only need a little bit at a time, and guess what?  I wear it during the DAY!  It&#x27;s the only thing I can ever find that isn&#x27;t greasy, that goes on so smoothly and that doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen in it.  I&#x27;ve had Melanoma before so I&#x27;m very careful about not only wearing sunscreen when I need to, but also not overdoing it and not having it on my face CONTINUALLY.  It&#x27;s not good for your skin when you have chemicals all over it all the time.  So... the &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; cream is what I use on my face to moisturize in the morning, then if I WANT to put on sunscreen, I do.  There are weeks at a time in the winter when I don&#x27;t need sunscreen because the UV index is virtually zero when it&#x27;s cloudy and/or raining, so I like to have a choice about whether to have it on my face or not.  Again, too many chemicals are not good for your skin, so while sunscreen is a great invention and allows us to go outdoors without being burned from damaging ultraviolet rays, it should still be used sparingly.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully also as a day cream for those of us with dry winter skin.  Fragrance-free is a big plus.</li>
    <li> Love the way this leaves my skin feeling..</li>
    <li> Love this face cream! great price</li>
    <li> Simple, unscented face cream. I didn&#x27;t have any bad reactions to this.</li>
    <li> This is a great night cream for sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s not going to take away wrinkles or remove dark spots, but it&#x27;s so inexpensive that you&#x27;ll have money left over to spring for the expensive creams.</li>
    <li> Love this product, but it&#x27;s so much easier to order it here and have it sent to me directly than it is to go to the store and hope they have some in stock!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  Great skin care, I get many compliments from people my own age, they tell me I have great looking facial skin.</li>
    <li> left my skin feeling softer and looking so much healthier and clearer from the very first night. didn&#x27;t cause me to break out but still provided so much moisture i love it for my annoyingly sensitive skin (that ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING disagrees with) and will use it for as long as neutrogena keeps it around, please don&#x27;t discontinue this, i will die!!!</li>
    <li> This goes on nice but iit contains fragrance which I did not care for with sensitive skin.  I do use it but not anywhere near my eye as it did not absorb very well and I did get some near my eyes and it bothered me all day as my eyes were stinging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a year and it has helped my face stay soft and supple and no new wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Love this night cream and the only one I prefer to use on my 56 year old skin. So smooth and as I have fragrance allergies, this does not bother me at all.</li>
    <li> Very light face cream that seems to get absorbed into the skin and does not lie greasy spots on pillowcases and can be used as a daytime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a face lotion for years that doesn&#x27;t clog (I have oily skin, at least in the T-Zone), isn&#x27;t so fragrant that it makes my allergies go crazy, moisturizes sufficiently, and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg--I found this one! Love it love love it. It is think enough and oily enough to really make my skin feel soft, but has a very light almost imperceptible scent, and is very inexpensive compared to others on the market. I can even get away with wearing a bit of it during the day under my makeup and it works like a charm to soften up my scratchy cheeks. I am only 33 and have had mostly oily skin all my life, but my cheeks are just needing more and this does the job. And it isn&#x27;t so oily that it clogs the other areas of my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while, and it works ok on insanely dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin like a normal moisturizer it sits there and makes my skin very oily and won&#x27;t come off unless I wash my face again. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend. it doesn&#x27;t make me break out though.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer out there and a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love this product. After trying many tgat would just leave my face feeling greasy this one actually feels good. I wear it during the day too because Im not very outdoorsy so Im hardly where sunlight would affect me.</li>
    <li> Let me start with i&#x27;m 22 and i have a face that is very dry, during winter it flakes a little. I use this everynight (a thick amount) and the next day my face is maintained mostourized all day even through my shower..! This was my first time using it and i will remain using it. Favorite cream!</li>
    <li> A decent light noght cream I mix with rose hip oil.</li>
    <li> NOT REAL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it before I saw it at Walmart. It tried in Walmart one and it is different smell . This makes me not feel wanna to use it anymore</li>
