<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it. But after having it for a year, I don&#x27;t really use it anymore. It probably wasn&#x27;t worth it for me to buy it. You have to really like your beauty regime for this to be worth it i think. It scrubs your face, sure. But I think a wash cloth and your favorite cleanser works just as well, if not better and is a HELL of a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> On June 4th, 2013 I ordered TWO Clarisonic Pro Sonic Skin Cleaning Systems. From Beautogen via Amazon&lt;br /&gt;One for myself, one for my daughter-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived on recycling day. I removed both out of the shipping box and quickly brought the box outside just in time to catch the garbage men.&lt;br /&gt;Two days later I had time to try my Clarisonic. Both boxes looked crappy. I put the better one aside for my daughter-in-law&#x27;s birthday (on June 23rd). It was sealed.&lt;br /&gt;I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT! The first one (mine) that I opened was USED!!!!! There was dried soap all around the brush and soap scum in the charger. There was NO info in the box. I had to go to the website to figure out how to use it! Plus the unit shuts down every 20 seconds!!!But I had thrown away the shipping box. And I figured: I would just deal with it....&lt;br /&gt;BUT then yesterday was my daughter-in-law&#x27;s birthday. She was so excited to see the present I had given her.&lt;br /&gt;THERE WAS NO CHARGER AND NO FACE BRUSH in the box.&lt;br /&gt;I SPENT ove $400 dollars for these!!&lt;br /&gt;One can&#x27;t be use and one was used/dirty and and doesn&#x27;t work well!&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted Beautogen. Waiting to hear from them. I am furious!</li>
    <li> Buy this and you skin will thank you forever..it is hands down the beat investment I have ever made when it comes to skincare.</li>
    <li> Already gave a review... Can&#x27;t beat the price and it&#x27;s well worth it. For $40-$45.00 more you get the best model which has 4 speeds unlike the Mia&#x27;s or the Plus models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now just need to make sure I can purchase the replacement brush heads; deep pore cleansing heads which are NOT knock-off types but legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions from others would be helpful. Clarisonic&#x27;s website is just like any local store price. Typically $25.00 per replacement brush head.  Would like to have a set of 3 or 4 in deep pore cleaning brush heads and 2-4 body brush heads.</li>
    <li> she loves it!  Great Christmas present.  Tell her you care how she looks!!</li>
    <li> I have somewhat oily skin - which is okay with me as I have always looked 10-15 years younger than I am.  However, after starting medication for ADD, my skin started producing MORE oil, which led to serious acne issue.  I tried a lot of  things, including honey (which has natural antibacterial properties), apple cider vinegar, etc.  But nothing was working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a skin specialist, and she recommended this Clarisonic Pro.  I&#x27;ve used it with the Skin Medica acne wash.  And my skin is finally clearing up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do want to caution:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using it twice a day. I went to a new esthetician and she told me that my skin was becoming to thin with the use of the Clarisonic.  She said that I should only use it once or twice per week.  So, please be careful and make sure that you&#x27;re checking in with your esthetician or dermatologist regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with my purchase and the way it makes my face feel so smooth and clean. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to buy this for several years and I regret it.  After only a few weeks my face was softer, clearer, smoother than it has ever been in my life and I am almost 60.  It also has  that beautiful soft glow of healthy skin and naturally pink cheeks. People ask what skin creams I am using and I say - NONE!  All I use is the Clarisonic with the brush for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin 3-4 times a week with my regular skin cleanser, Cetaphil.  You don&#x27;t even have to use it everyday, in fact it&#x27;s probably better not to do so.  You will not need anymore of the expensive creams, just a good moisturizer with sunscreen for your skin type.  It even greatly reduces, or even gets rid of, brown spots.  Ditto for fine lines. It got rid of blackheads that I have had for years the first use!  Don&#x27;t wait to get this. If you can&#x27;t afford this model at least get the MIA.  You will save so much money on phony skin creams that this purchase will pay for itself. This is the first review I&#x27;ve written for Amazon in long time, but I had to do it because this product is so amazing and I felt it was important that people know about it. It is extremely effective and a great time and money saver.</li>
    <li> Replaced one that I dropped one too many times!  This one is a great replacement, and its in white to match my bathroom.</li>
    <li> First encountered Clarisonic at two different spas in getting facials. Both the facial people swore by it. My wife was skeptical at first but decided to buy one for the home. It really is great. It feels enjoyable to use, our faces do feel cleaner. The wife loves the body attachment as well. This is now part of our daily cleansing ritual.</li>
    <li> Love the product and the price was fabulous.  Use it almost everyday, love the added extension for use with the body brush.</li>
    <li> Just love this skin cleaner.  My skin is brighter, firmer and more youthful....and very clean.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on my Clarisonic!  I was resistant to buying one due to the price, but am glad I did due to the incredible clean I experience with it every time.  Mild blemishes cleared up fast and my back and arms feel baby soft.  I feel like I am pampering myself at a spa each time I use it.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the machine...</li>
    <li> When I was considering purchase one of these &#x27;must-have&#x27; gadgets, I thought I would go with MIA, but then I realized you are not buying this stuff everyday. Besides, I am an international shopper, I may not have someone carry them back for me again soon. With these combination of thoughts, I fortunately clicked on PRO, searched for the best offer, proceeded to check-out (phew...hard sign) I DID it! .... when my friend returned, I studied the manual carefully, I charged it over night, awaited like &#x27;forever&#x27; to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was one of my BIG investment and I&#x27;m so proud of myself that I did make the bright decision! I love my Clarisonic very much, it gives me smoooooth and cleeeean face. In fact, I&#x27;m getting more head-brushes now. I&#x27;ll be dammmn if I were purchasing MIA, you know what I mean ... I&#x27;d recommend everyone go for PRO, I wouldn&#x27;t want just your face to be smooth, would you? :&amp;#34;)</li>
    <li> After hearing all the hype I ordered this and was happy to receive within the week.  I found it odd that i was only instructed to use this one minute per day - but it made sense given that it&#x27;s intended for daily use.  Although i don&#x27;t use it daily every time I do my skin feels clear of the grime and humidity that i obviously accumulated throughout the day/week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel that that it may be a bit much to use daily as my skin does feel a bit dry after use.  My usual skin care products seems to absorb extra well though...</li>
    <li> worst!!&lt;br /&gt;it is not operate for body.&lt;br /&gt;i live in korea&lt;br /&gt;so i can&#x27;t  take back!!&lt;br /&gt;i want take back</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s convenience,and make my skin feel so healthy.&lt;br /&gt;If my friend ask me,i&#x27;ll  recommend it without doubt.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> I wish I had known about this device sooner. I had visible results within 2 days!! My skin continues to clear up (it was very broken out).  I will always use this product and tell others about it.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> After using it for some time I have found my pores are much cleaner (less clogged) than before.  I only use it once a day, in the evening to especially remove makeup.  I definately don&#x27;t need to go for expensive facials with this product unless I want it for relaxation.  I felt it was expensive at first but if you compare it to several facials it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this gadget! I have had a cheaper version in the past and this one is so much better! Some of those large pores are going away. Not sure I needed the extension piece, but love the body scrubber. Really helps get rid of those little bumps I get on my shoulders and back!</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s a clairsonic!  Skin feels so much smoother.  I have rosacea and sensitive skin so I cant use it as much as I would like but with the little I am able to, it&#x27;s fantastic.  Would recommend but if you have rosacea or sensitive skin just be careful as it may be a bit too abrasive for your skin type.  I still give it 5 stars cause the fact that our skin is sensitive is not the products fault.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy. Price was good . Brand new with comlete package as advertised. Would recommend to others to buy and use.</li>
    <li> no issues thus far - works great 6 mos. later - brushes are easy to find on line - which is good - they are very expensive - and i did have to change to the sensitive skin brushes and/or acne brushes - like the body wand//brush option - but have never used</li>
    <li> Nice and very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;We own a ARIA and this unit is way more powerful</li>
    <li> Purchased one for my daughter and one for myself.  We both love it.  Keeps our skin fresh looking and soft.  I previously had the Olay brush and it does not compare.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Powerfullly cleanses and creates a smooth healthy glow. Have had mine for years now without any issues. A worthwhile investment. Both a face and body brush included, i have bought numerous refills on both of them and use whatever cleansing wash i have at the moment.  This is truly a quality tool beauty tool.  A must have for great skin!</li>
    <li> It kept breaking and I tried to reset it by using another plug. It worked for a day and then fizzled out. Clarisonic said to only buy from the authorized dealers. She made it very clear that Amazon was not an authorized dealer. Sending it back now. Too bad because when it did work I loved it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself around Thanksgiving 2012, so have had use of the Clarisonic for over a year. No complaints at all with the brush, it&#x27;s function, the charging unit, etc. Replacement brushes are easy to find at department stores, drug stores, and Sephora stores, but they can be pricey. I have noticed an improvement in the appearance and texture of my 41-year-old skin with use of this as well as use of quality moisturizers and cleansers. I do think you&#x27;d be just fine with the non-pro version. Although the pro version comes with the extension wand and extra speed settings, I find I use only one speed setting, and only used the extension wand once or twice when I first bought the set. Consider whether you really need the extra features before spending more money for the Pro model.</li>
    <li> I originally got a Clarisonic Mia and really wanted the Pro.  Boy, did I wish I bought it sooner.  My skin feels so soft and I just love the Refining Skin Polish.  Also, that handle comes in handy for your back.</li>
    <li> I like the Clarisonic PRO Sonic Skin Cleansing for Face and Body. This one is the best forever. I will buy one for my girl.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine told me about this device. It really worked on her so I&#x27;m going to try it myself.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this set. It isn&#x27;t cheap though. Makes your face feel smooth and clean. Solid design. Set it on High and leave it there.</li>
    <li> I should have returned it, but I threw the box away.  Purchasing this was a huge mistake and an expensive learning experience. You are better off buying a less expensive model from a store that accepts returns.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and have been consistently using it in the morning and evenings. I must say that I have noticed a substantial difference in my skin. The routine I had before worked pretty well, but this little gadget has made it even more effective. In the evenings I use a small amount of Alba Botanica acne face wash, followed by a small amount of AcneFree benzoyl peroxide. In the mornings I use the Alba face wash followed by the Alba Acne lotion, usually followed by mineral makeup from Zuzu cosmetics. I&#x27;ve had fewer break outs, my pores have been cleaner, and my skin feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I don&#x27;t really use the body brush because it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s doing much and is a little annoying to put together. I would suggest passing on this package in particular and just going with the face only option (hence, the 4 stars). Otherwise, this is fabulous product that I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My skin looks better every day.  I use it every other day and am very happy I purchased it and the savings.</li>
    <li> My wife cant live without it even for a single. Its still working and I have no regrets buying.</li>
    <li> good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! My friend recommended it. It stays charged forever and my face looks and feels so clean after using it. It&#x27;s super powerful, so I only use it about once a week. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> After using this product my skin breaks out. It&#x27;s just too irritating to my skin even on the most gentle setting.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this product, and I am sure everything I have to say has already been included in prior reviews. I LOVE my Clarisonic! I use it daily and it has dramatically reduced the size of the pores on my nose. It works brilliantly to smooth away dry skin patches. My skin absorbs moisturizer better and my liquid foundation applies more evenly. Also, the cleansing vibrations feel like a mini-facial massage! I know it may be cost-prohibitive, but if you can afford it, a Clarisonic is one of the best investments you can make in yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in April 2014.  Right now it broke.  Please let me know how to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic Pro so much that we purchased this one as a gift for my sister. It&#x27;s a quality product and is excellent at keeping your skin looking beautiful. It is such an easy skincare routine daily, I&#x27;m not sure I would want to live without it!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend.  It is a rich moisturizer and the fragrance is so pleasant!  However, it seems less thick than when it was first launched.</li>
    <li> I have used a Clarisonic Pro for about 7 years.  The first one I bought from a spa and it lasted about 3 years, then I sent it back to Clarisonic and they repaired it for free and it lasted another 2 years.  I saw it on Amazon Prime with next day shipping so I bought it.  It worked great for about 10 days and then suddenly it was as if it was on the weakest setting (barely vibrating) and doing nothing.  So, I returned it and bought another one from the same place, thinking that I must have gotten a lemon.  Same thing, the replacement comes and it works great for about 10 days and then cuts down to barely vibrating.  I called Clarisonic and asked them if they have ever heard of this happening before.  They told me that Amazon is not a authorized distributor and they may be getting them from China were there is no quality control.  So, I send my 2nd one back to Amazon and now bought one through a recommended dealer (so far so good!:-)  Now, I find out that I have been charged a $38.00 &amp;#34;re-stocking&amp;#34; fee for each of the two Clarisonic Pro&#x27;s I had to return because they did not work properly!  I spent $76.00 is &amp;#34;re-stocking&amp;#34; fees because I was given a defective product twice.  DO NOT BUY A CLARISONIC PRO FROM THIS SITE, YOU NEED TO BUY IT FROM AN AUTHORIZED DEALER SO THAT IF IT STOPS WORKING.....CLARISONIC WILL REPAIR IT FOR FREE DURING YOUR 3 YEAR WARRENTY!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I had initially started with Clarisonic by purchasing their Mia 2, when i loved that and realized i wanted one to keep in the shower - I went for the Pro. I LOVE it, i LOVE both of them, and having the two is super convenient. I use the PRO for my showers and my mia for random in-between the day washes and it&#x27;s also perfect for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the arm extension and body brush that came with the PRO and the additional speed settings. I would recommend these products to anyone. They are soooooo much better than washing with your hands. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed the difference in my skin, being somone who struggles with acne.</li>
    <li> This pro model worked fine for about 1 1/2 years and then stopped working.  It had a 3 year guarantee, but Clarisonic will not honor that guarantee unless you buy from them or a dealer that they &amp;#34;recognize&amp;#34;. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on anything else fromt his company.</li>
    <li> I get a facial once a month and the aesthetician always uses a Clarisonic.  She recommended that I get one for home.  This package with the body brush and extension was exactly as advertised and I was able to register it on the Clarisonic web site.</li>
    <li> Love it, my face is baby butt smooth after a few days of usage. I use 1-2 a day, and have noticed a younger, fresher me. Higher recommended, easy to use, and well worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase of the Clarisonic PRO.  It&#x27;s been a reliable and helpful tool in my daily cleansing regimen. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have been a happy customer since I first purchased my Clarisonic Pro skin brush. I have oily, acne prone skin and began using the Clarisonic at the suggestion of my dermatologist. The first weeks was rough.  My skin seem to erupt, but this was due to purging the impurities from my skin. I had to stick with it and now my skin is smooth and clear. My skin has been clear for nearly 6 years with a only 1-2 pimples occasionally. The brush is a bit expensive, but worth the price. Generic replacement heads work well with the brush and cut down on the cost of owning the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first brush died just shortly before the warranty was to expire. I called customer service and the representative was very helpful. I explained the issue I was experiencing with my brush (it no longer was oscillating). I provided her with my model number and the date of purchase and I was sent a new brush, charger and brush heads within 7 business days. My replacement recently died and I had the same great experience with customer service and I am expecting my replacement in a few days.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this for my face; but thought, what the heck, for a few more dollars, I&#x27;ll get the body brush also.  Well, I really like the face cleaning part of the deal.  It&#x27;s fun to use and does a great job; but the body brush is just silly.  Do you have any idea how long it takes to go over your entire body with a two-inch brush?  I can get the job done and probably get more exfoliation in less than half the time with one of those abrasive body sheet things.</li>
    <li> Best investment ever. If you wear sunscreen or makeup, or if you just spend time outside being physical or working out, the Clarisonic PRO will replenish your skin. I love this device.</li>
    <li> I bought the clarisonic for my chest and back acne.  That is slowly getting better.  But, after only a week or so of using it on my face as well, my mother asked me if I had botox or some other treatment to my face.  It looks smoother and younger!  I am so happy with this product!  Well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> Works as noted on all the infomercials, ordered more brushes - check them out before ordering as they are for different skin types.  We ordered the sensitive type of brush as we use it daily and don&#x27;t want to overdo or irritate our skins.  Brushes are good for 3 months.  Nice package.</li>
    <li> It is nice but I do not think it is worth the money. I need the body brush to be a litltle faster and rougher. It is ok, can&#x27;t brag about it, but that is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several years and it continues to work wonderfully.  I knew it was worth it when several women I worked with came and asked me what I was doing to improve my skin.  Also, my sisters also asked me the same thing and have all bought one themselves.  My skin was always horrible, a mess. Since the Clarisonic, people are always saying what great skin I have.  I see kids with bad skin and wish I could just give them a unit for free. It worked a miricle on me.&lt;br /&gt;Had the other leading brand for a couple of months and it just stopped working.  I have used  the clarisonic daily for at least four years and it still works fine. You have to change the brush every now and then but its WELL WORTH IT.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  [[ASIN:B008ZM2KDA Clarisonic PRO Sonic Skin Cleansing for Face and Body, White]]</li>
    <li> My product shipped promptly and was exactly as advertised. I have been using it for almost a month. I wish that I had purchased it sooner. I have absolutely no complaints and would purchase another in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> I loved the results I received from my Clarisonic PRO that I purchased another as a gift to my son &amp; his family!  I highly recommend  this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product on Amazon a little bit nervous and my gut feeling is right. I attempted to register the product right away after opening the box. While registering the product on Clarisonic.com, product # is needed. You should be able to find the number printed at the bottom of the handle. There is NONE!!! So I went on amazon and carefully read the reviews, I saw someone mentioned this problem that they cannot make any claims (warranty or return) as Clarisonic was able to say right away that the products were fake. They do not sell on amazon. I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance to wait till it stops working and won&#x27;t be able to return. I returned the product right away. I was able to get the product with 20% coupon discount at Sephora at the same price.</li>
    <li> i love my clarisonic. it works so well to clean and exfoliate face and body. i use in shower and while not very strong for body exfoliation it works well.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This product has really made a difference in my skin!  The best way to describe it is that my skin feels polished and really clean after I use it.  It makes my moisutrizer and make-up apply more smoothly, so I look (and feel!) better.  The effect is also long lasting, and I have noticed that my skin feels softer and looks clearer over time (about 2 months now).  I held off buying this for a long time because of the price, but now I wish I had purchased it sooner.  I will never be without it again!</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife for Christmas.  I thought that the ad indicated that the PRO model included the extended handle, but when the product was delivered, it did not include the extended handle.  Other than that (she bought it separately), she loves the product.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased this Clarisonic Pro. Great for softening my elbows, knees, heels &amp; overall skin. Love the handle.  I would recommend this for family &amp; friends.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I use it everyday and really like it.  Great product for anyone to use.  Simple and easy.</li>
    <li> I really love the system.  I see such a difference in the undertone of my skin.  I have skin problems and although the discoloration is still on my face I can see that my skin is much healthier.  Definately invest in this product.</li>
    <li> Makes your daily routine more fun.. I feel like I have a new and improved face since using my Clarisonic Pro. They say give it a month or so before breakouts give up (it is bringing everything to the surface.) Love this product!!</li>
    <li> I debated for a long time whether to buy the Mia model or go ahead and get the Pro... SO HAPPY with this model! I have only been using about a week, but my skin is already showing awesome improvement! One thing I did not anticipate was that the sonic vibration must stimulate cell regrowth and blood supply, because the red scarring from recent acne outbreaks is almost gone.. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone and will be spreading the word among my friends and family... Worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is my second Clarisonic. After 6 years, I dropped my first one and it stopped working. I liked the idea of the handle for the body brush but found it to be awkward, top heavy, and too long and difficult to manage. I still use it on my body, but without the handle. I use a regular back brush for my back, and the rest of my body can be brushed with hands on the main unit. I&#x27;m still happy with the main unit and face and body brushes.</li>
    <li> After just a few days my skin looked and felt much better. People ask if I am using something new on my skin.</li>
    <li> I already had one and wanted my daughter to have one.  She loves it.  Best price out there and Clarisonic is a great company that backs up their product.  Loveeeeeee it!</li>
    <li> Clairsonic has it right. I also use the Clairsonic Opal after cleansing to apply my moisturizer and find it to keep my skin perfectly maintained. I love this product and have purchased three others for family members whom all love the effects of the washing and sonic cleaning.  My 16 year old turns to it when she&#x27;s having a breakout and this device clears up her skin quickly without harsh acne chemicals. I use it without their cleaning products, as I prefer some of my own but wouldn&#x27;t go without it. I know others make similar products but the price is worth it and found the drugstore variety cheap and much more rough on my skin.</li>
    <li> Not much more to add really, my better half simply loves it, in fact she swears by it, I win</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has a face to wash.  You will see a difference after using it ONCE. And your skin care products will absorb better right after you use it.  Definitely worth it. BUT beware as I returned mine from this particular site as it was refurbished,  not brand new,  and it didn&#x27;t say this any where in the description.</li>
    <li> Love the way it cleans, but already having issues with the motor and it is less than a year old.  I don&#x27;t use every night.  I use maybe two to three times a week.</li>
    <li> I have the face cleaner and enjoyed it. I wanted the body cleanser also. It is a joy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this, only have had it a week an it really cleans.  Can&#x27;t wait to see results after a couple of months use.</li>
    <li> I am so happy my friend told me about this product I absolutely love it I can already see a difference in my skin</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd clarisonic that died within a year. Every time I turned this one on I wondered if it was gonna work and tonight it didn&#x27;t.  At this point, I&#x27;m questioning its dependability and quality. Despite the drawer of pre purchased brushes, I doubt I will try for # 3</li>
    <li> Great price and got a bunch of extra attachments.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have acne and it&#x27;s starting to go away. I love it. I use it everyday on my face and body. My skin is much smoother. I love it!</li>
    <li> After purchasing a Clarisonic Mia2 for myself at Christmastime, I fell in love with the feeling of the skin on my face.  I&#x27;m so thrilled with how smooth, clean and soft my complexion is now.&lt;br /&gt;Because I want an equally super-clean feeling for the skin on the rest of my body, I just bought the Clarisonic PRO for the shower.  My Clarisonic Mia2 now stays at the sink, for evening face wash, and will be packed for travel.  Wish I&#x27;d discovered Clarisonic a LONG time ago.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to register your new Clarisonic, whatever the model.  Your reward will be $25 off of your first purchase of brush heads or any other accessory.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes my skin soft healthier looking. Easy to use. Can use it many times before having to charge. This was a good price for an expensive product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Came with a body Brush handle and a body brush. It was cheaper on Amazon as I checked the price at Macy&#x27;s before purchasing it. Before I started using it I had patchy dry areas of skin which are not there any more. Gives a glow to the skin.</li>
    <li> Gets my face clean and exfoliates as well.  I highly recommend this little gem:) Your face and body will thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used the face, Mia, for 1+ years before I looked into getting this.  Since I already have a dedicated facial one, I use this exclusively for the body.  With the handle, it feels like a massage on my body.  I can&#x27;t tell the noticeable difference on my body.  I do swear by the face from the Mia.  Definitely recommend for giving it a try with the handle.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I love the 4 speeds.  It makes your face feel so clean.  I use mine with cetaphyl liquid cleanser and the sensitive head.  Does not dry out my skin and I have very dry skin.  If you can afford the pro model, I think it is well worth it.  I&#x27;m 47 and never had great skin, but my skin is nice and clear since using.  I just bought the clarisonic opal and also just started using.  Waiting for the nuface micro current trinity to come, as well.  I next want to purchase the PMD.  I would highly recommend the clarisonic pro.</li>
    <li> it is a great addition to routine facial care! cleans and smoothes and makes your skin feel great! a spa treatment every morning and evening!</li>
    <li> I have had severe acne for over 8 years and had tried several different treatments.  The clarisonic exfoliates and works in medication at the same time.  I have been using it for three weeks now and my acne is almost completely healed.  I know things don&#x27;t always for the same for everyone, however the clarisonic definitely helps my skincare routine greatly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I thought I needed the PRO, but it was nice that it came included with the different brushes as well as the wand for body brushing. In retrospect, I barely change the settings, so having the option to change speeds and on/off times is a bit wasted. I imagine a step-down model without all of those bells and whistles would have been perfectly acceptable. I find that my skin is infinitely cleaner and softer and has grown to handle the daily exfoliation without become irritated. Moisturizing is a huge component of my daily routine (and NOT something to be skipped), but I don&#x27;t think anyone should try to exfoliate without following-up with some kind of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My makeup applies more evenly and removes even moreso. I really like the facial scrub with microbeads that comes included in a travel size, however, I just use soap or my regular daily facial cleanser with this product and it works just fine. For the price, this is a great deal, especially if you think you&#x27;re actually going to use all of the extensive features. I just wish I bought the model down because I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!!! I can&#x27;t believe how great it makes my face feel.  I called my daughter even had her try it out as i was SO impressed.  Felt like i just had a facial.  So totally awesome. i just ordered another one for my daughter!</li>
    <li> First is a great tool it really is, different settings(4 speeds and 2 modes with  the body brush) and it does deliver a good clean as it promise, good exfoliant brush. It does give you a \\&quot;polished\\&quot; look after you use it the first time,  regardless of the product you are using it with. I&#x27;ve tried the product include it and is ok! Not too crazy about the scent.  I gave it 4 stars because you always need room for improvement: How about a brush sampler; A bigger model for the whole body as a daily routine  or a combo unit of the clarisonic brush and Opal  both charged at the same time to save space in the counter and plugs in the wall clarisonic Pro Rx.**+ with a light that enhances the health of the skin etc... Clarisonic  you need more feedback you will need to hire me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** my idea ( try to manufacture it please like ultrasonic and RF).&lt;br /&gt;+ to the marketing dept: We can work on the name and my future royalties lol.</li>
    <li> My 2nd clarisonic (first one I had to return). So far I am finding it worth my purchase price. I loved the body brush wand. Although a bit tricky initially to use it. Clarisonic face brush is now part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the cleaners go, I don&#x27;t really care much about them. I have my own cleansers that I use. Occassionally I do use the srubbing cleanser / bodywash they have with this kid. It is not bad, not special either. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> You just have to buy this and see how this tool works it&#x27;s magic! Pretty expensive but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Simple, quick and done! A facial everyday! Plus, a long handle to use in the shower with the body brush for your back and feet.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Nice skin cleaner.  Good battery life.</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic!  It gets makeup left behind from my makeup remover.  Adding this 1 minute into my bedtime routine has been great!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife and she absolutely loves it, uses it every day, and says her skin feels much better.</li>
    <li> I bought this after receiving a facial at the salon and talking to the aesthetician about it. After reading all the reviews online I thought I should give it a try and the Clarisonic Pro stood up to all of the reviews I&#x27;ve received so far. My face feel so much cleaner. I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and I&#x27;m addicted to at least once a day use sometimes twice.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Very fast shipping, all pieces were in box.  Have only used it for about a month, skin feels a softer, definitely cleans my skin much more than using my hands and a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this company and this product</li>
    <li> I used another facial brush previously and couldn&#x27;t get over the difference the first time I used this product. My face feels so soft. I used to get very small pimples on my chin (hormone related) which I treated with prescription creams from the dermatologist and they no longer exists - hooray! On the days I don&#x27;t use the product, I can see and feel the difference. If I get carried away and use it too much (more than the directions), I see my skin breaking out a little and not feeling as wonderful. You need to leave a little bit of a protective barrier on your skin. The handle is a little awkward and I&#x27;d just as soon use a puff on my body but for cleaning my face, it&#x27;s the best. The brush fits easily in the handle though and it&#x27;s easy to get in and out of which was one thing I was worried about.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this when I bought it having read all of the positive reviews on Amazon and other sites as well as the numerous recommendations in various magazines. What I found was that my acne got worse using it once daily. Now I use it once a week to exfoliate and that is the extent of my use.</li>
    <li> This is awesome and a must have for any woman who loves to be pampered. If you enjoy a mini message all over and want to feel really clean I would recommend this product. Had the Clarisonic for face only and I loved it but I work in a tire plant and there is carbon black floating in the air, Using the Clarisonic PRO Sonic Skin Cleansing for Face and Body gave my entire body a great feeling of clean! I gave my mom my Clarisonic for Face and she loves it but now she wants the Face and Body Clarisonic Pro.</li>
