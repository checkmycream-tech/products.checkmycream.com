<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Packaging so cute!  Amazing gift and decent quality</li>
    <li> Great brush set, the quality is so good you don&#x27;t want to miss this.</li>
    <li> Beautiful Brush Set ! Very well made and came in a great case ! I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes , they are super soft and had little shedding. These brushes apply makeup evenly and they are easily cleaned. Love the white container very stylish</li>
    <li> Just received mine today, very nice product with great packaging. The email they sent telling you to leave the brushes out and wash them to get rid of the chemical smell was very helpful. These are good quality. The only minor thing thy was wrong was my little orange brush seemed a little loose at the base. No huge deal though. Otherwise very happy.</li>
    <li> It so pretty and soft. I&#x27;m so happy with the order now.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great and the case makes it perfect to take on the go! I love it.</li>
    <li> Love them nice case to keep the brushes clean</li>
    <li> Received these brushes just in time for Christmas! I like the packaging and how it comes in a cute white case. Perfect for traveling. The brushes are extremely soft and very well made. I’ve purchased more expensive brushes but these are great quality and I love how it’s soft and not prickly. Some of my other brushes are so prickly I don’t use them anymore. Awesome deal for a gift too!</li>
    <li> 5 Stars- Because according to MY Dingbat, uh, wifee poo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 9-piece handmade brush set comes in a very nice cream colored, leather like, two-piece cylinder shape storage case that opens into two pieces and becomes a holder for the brushes while using, then closes up for storage.  The brushes are amazingly soft and flexible and came with a followup instruction sheet on how to unpack, air out the packing smell, and wash to prepare for use.  There is a brush for every possible need, all with very nice pearl colored handles with a nice feel to them.  The brushes are nice quality, handmade, natural hair bristle brushes that work very well.  Would recommend for personal use or as a gift.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift as a stocking stuffer or someone who loves make up :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are so nice! First of all, I loved the container they came in but the brushes are of very good quality. The bristles are soft enough to feel nice but not so soft that you can have precision.  They really pick up the product onto the brush so that it applies seamlessly. The brushes themselves are beautiful, I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> These are nice and sturdy! Very easy to use! Really like them</li>
    <li> Super efficient shipping and a great product!</li>
    <li> These are so classy and come in a cute case!!</li>
    <li> I Love Love Love these brushes . They are amazing. I used them for the first time this weekend and even my boyfriend said how good they were and how perfect they laid the makeup .</li>
    <li> The company warns you about a strong chemical smell but if you follow directions and air it for a few hours it&#x27;ll be perfect! I have many expensive brushes that are slowly failing on me..  these brushes are as great as the expensive brushes but so much cheaper!! Love it and recommend it to you if you wear makeup once in a while or in day to day basis! Gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Soft manageable brushes.  Easy to clean and not alot of loose hair.  The packaging is beautiful and it holds the brushes well without smashing them. I recommend these brushes to anyone looking for a good quality set for not alot of money.</li>
    <li> I am really liking the brushes now that I have used them a few times. I did follow the instructions that were emailed to me from the manufacturer and let them sit out of the plastic to eliminate the chemical smell from the leather and glue of the holder for about 15 minutes. They also recommend you massage the bristles and put the tip into 30 degree water to loosen the hair before you first use them. This will allow any loose hair to come out now instead of on you when you use it. I found after following these instructions the brushes are holding up and working well. I really like them for my makeup application needs, I use makeup almost daily so good brushes are a must. I also love that they were a good price (even cheaper for me because I used a promo code) and they came with the holder which is always nice.</li>
    <li> Very good quality brushes!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:1c0af6db137beba22be7354f1817d31a]] Here is my review and unboxing of this Queen B makeup brush set.  I think this is a really fabulous set of brushes that comes in a really nice gift box.  Perfect for yourself or anyone else for any special occasion.  The brushes are very good quality at a great price. Check out my video where I show you each brush and give you my honest impression of the set.</li>
    <li> Such a great set of brushes wish I would of found them sooner</li>
    <li> This is the perfect gift idea for the girly girl in your life!!!  I absolutely love these brushes.  They are exquisite and I am so glad to have them. They apply my makeup with ease and smoothness.  I love how my makeup looks using these brushes.... Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Love how these came packaged.  The box it comes in has a really nice ribbon that keeps it closed and the actual holder is really pretty as well.  The brushes do need to be washed before you use them.</li>
    <li> high quality good value</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived so fast and they really look gorgeous. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I can already imagine ways in how to use them. The bristles are really soft. I can&#x27;t wait to try using this. The packaging is so neat. Makes a good and expensive looking gift if you are looking for one.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Soft and seemingly good quality, however I have only used once.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these. I don&#x27;t usually wear make up but wanted to start experimenting. This set came in such wonderful packaging that I did not want to even use them. LOL. Love the case. Looks so fine! They are very soft and just nice to see and use. I am very happy with them. would be great as a gift too!</li>
    <li> These are great for travel with the container</li>
    <li> These brushes are beautiful.  The leather case is a wonderful addition, although, I probably won&#x27;t use it to carry the brushes around as it is fairly large.  I normally use a brush made by laura mercier to apply my eye shadow but these brushes are easily as nice.</li>
    <li> This Stunning 9 Piece Makeup Brush Set is very good quality and does an excellent job at applying makeup. My daughter uses these every day since these arrived and she loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These well made brushes come in a nice storage/carrying case that nicely holds them when not in use. The brushes do come a little stiff and have a slight odor, but the instructions for getting them ready for use are quite good and the results are worth the effort. Once ready for use, these are very soft and apply makeup evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are an excellent choice and a very good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: sample provided to review</li>
    <li> This is a great makeup brush set. I bought this for a friend, and she loved it...The white box looks chic...</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft!! The white leather holder is a really nice touch as well.  The actual holder is actually a lot nicer than what the picture depicts.  Thank you for this set!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome set of brushes!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush set!! Works amazing!!! It is very well made and it works wonderfully for the application of my make up!!</li>
    <li> One word!!!AWESOME!!!!</li>
    <li> Just got these today and I can&#x27;t believe such great quality! And I LOVE the holder they come in.</li>
    <li> They are so soft! And the case is an added bonus, I always have a hard time finding somewhere to put my brushes. They are great for quick and easy makeup, and the blush brush is amazing!</li>
    <li> I am truly so impressed with the quality of these brushes! Even the case is gorgeous! I&#x27;m sure the case will unfortunately get discolored with makeup because it is white, but when I opened it up, it has a WOW factor. The brushes don&#x27;t shed and the applications is smooth. I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase! I will be buying more for gifts!</li>
    <li> What a beautiful makeup brush set! I love it! you can have it sit in the bottom part so it all stays in one place to help with counter space, and you can then just pop the top on and put it in your carry on when you go on vacation! Beautiful set with everything I could need! I love the box it came in! The brushes definitely feel luxurious!</li>
    <li> I have never wrote a review before but for these awesome brushes I felt I had to they great they apply makeup beautifully so soft but not to soft well made they will last years definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Really soft brushes, very lightweight. Great product!</li>
    <li> This brush set is beautiful. The brushes are extra soft and makeup goes on easy. This set would be a great gift. You don&#x27;t have to worry about the lid coming off while in your bag and messing up your brushes, it comes in a white case and the lid is attached securely with snaps..</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes! And the case they come in is adorable and easily stores  anywhere!!</li>
    <li> lovely set of brushes</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.  The case is a very nice hard case.  The brushes are a great quality and my makeup goes on smoothly.  My daughter keeps stealing them so I think it might be time to buy her some.</li>
    <li> Quality brushes. Adorable casing and brushes are soft to the touch with little shedding. Always wanted a set like this but couldnt afford the pricey ones, this is an inexpensive alternative and it shipped fast! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful container, extremely sturdy. Nice brushes. Love this buy. :)</li>
    <li> Great Brushes. At first they shed a bit I washed and conditioned them and away the shedding went! When you first open the case you will notice a weird smell I just let mine air out for a few hours and the smell was completely gone. The brushes are great! Bristles are soft, thick, and handles are great. Packaging is GENIOUS cute box, case, and product. Makes a perfect gift to family, friends, or yourself!</li>
    <li> Love love this set!  It was more than what I expected.  The brushes are nice and soft and the holder is awesome.  Glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> super fast ship!! Just this is what I want ~~  I do love it!! perfect tool for my makeup !! Thx so much!! And will get back to buy more and highly recommend to everyone!!</li>
    <li> In love with this makeup case. Best one I ever purchase.</li>
    <li> Absolutely my best cosmetic accessory purchase ever!! These brushes are fantastic superior quality and come in an excellent case too!! I cannot praise this product enough!</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are actually pretty nice brushes. They come in a really nice white crocodile textured leather case which I love, all packaged up in a nice box. Because of some of the other complaints, I inspected each brush thoroughly. I checked for loose bristles and loose ferrules. Out of all 10 brushes I received, including the little extra liner brush, only one had a very slightly loose ferrule. That doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s not that loose and, if by chance it ever does fall off, I can easily glue it back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first open them, yes, they do have a bit of a factory smell. Big deal, open them up and let them air out a bit. The odor will go away. I can totally recommend these brushes, no problem. The brushes are well made, they hold their shape well, they have nice, soft, full brush heads, and I saw not one single loose hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than a little blip of annoyance I had with the companies response to a previous reviewers low star rating, which the reviewer is fully entitled to leave, but I don&#x27;t think the product deserves, I have found the company to be very available and open to suggestions, not only willing to stand by their product, but also willing to consider one customers request to purchase the leather case alone, without the brushes, and in different colors. It is a really nice case, and I would be interested in the possibility of purchasing just the case as well if it&#x27;s ever available and especially if it comes in different colors. Bright yellow, beautiful bright orange, and turquoise blue would be some colors I&#x27;d love to see.</li>
    <li> what a beauty this set is! the case is beautiful, the brushes are wonderful quality. would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes! First off, they came in packaged soon nicely! I was quite impressed. I&#x27;d actually order these as a gift bc they&#x27;re wrapped and packaged so well. Second, they are just really nice brushes and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using them. The biggest brush is just perfect for my all over powder and bronzer. The second biggest brush I actually use for my liquid makeup instead of for powder and it works PERFECT for my liquid makeup. I also really like the eyeshadow brushes and how soft they are. These are my new favorite brushes and I will continue to use these exclusively for the foreseeable future!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice case and packaging. Reminds me of an Estee Lauder set I got a few years back.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so pretty. I love the packaging too. The case can also be used as storage cups for your brushes if you want to keep them out. The handles of the brushes are very sturdy. I have not experienced any shedding with these brushes so far which is a major plus in my opinion. These are definitely good quality brushes that are very affordable.</li>
    <li> Okay. I bought these because of the good reviews and I hate to be the only one to give them an average review. But here is goes.&lt;br /&gt;I like to think I know quite a bit about make up, and I am used to a high quality standard for brushes. I buy most of my foundation brushes at Sephora because they are really nice and soft, and work very well. However, they are expensive. So, I decided to buy a set online. Based on the reviews for how soft and amazing they are, I decided I would get these ones. All the brushes came in the set, and as many reviews said, they had a strong smell. Alright, so I left them out for a day. Still smelled very strong, so I left them out for two days and they still had a smell. I wanted to use them so I gave up on letting them air out any longer.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as to people claiming how soft they are. Uhhhhh, not sure if you have felt a soft brush before. Only one of them was soft, and that was the blush brush (angled brush) that came in the set. The other ones were all just average. I was really looking forward to having the powder brushes be very soft, however, they aren&#x27;t, and the larger one is actually pretty itchy when I use it on my face. While I did mainly buy the brushes for the larger brushes, the smaller ones for eyes and everything are okay. No complaints there. I am just pretty upset with the two powder brushes because they are not soft and I don&#x27;t like using them on my face. I do because I paid for them. So yeah, just an average brush set.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this brush set is really good for people who are just starting out with make up and don&#x27;t know how to use all the brushes properly. It is good because it&#x27;s a pretty basic set.</li>
    <li> Bought these brushes for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved them! They very high quality. I was impressed with the packaging and the carrying case! I would certainly recommend!</li>
    <li> What a fantastic set of brushes! Comes nicely wrapped if sending as a gift. Brushes are strong smooth and soft! Follow the direction of the seller in using the brushes and you will love them too!!!!</li>
    <li> The quality of these brushes is great.  So many to choose from to make your face look perfect.  I love the container they come in.  I was so impressed with the product I gave it as a gift.</li>
    <li> The product is AMAZING. Quality is A+++++. I got them to give as a gift for someone, but I&#x27;m really having a hard time with it. I might keep these for myself!!!</li>
    <li> These are pretty nice brushes.  There are like all brush sets, a couple that are better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, there are two items you get in this set that you don&#x27;t normally find in brush sets:  A Foam Shadow Applicator &amp; Eyebrow Brush&lt;br /&gt;I really like having these two products in the set, there are times when I prefer a foam applicator and it&#x27;s so hard to find one because most palettes come with brushes, so that definitely is a huge plus to this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a bit of a paint smell when you open the set, but over time I hope that smell to dissiptate.  It seems to be coming from the case and not the brushes though.  The case itself is just absolutely gorgeous.  Even the box is beautiful and can be used for storing other things when you take your brush case out!!  The faux alligator is really pretty, but it seems that it&#x27;s easily to get dirty.  Hopefully it will stand up to a lot of wear and tear, however I&#x27;ve not had it long enough to know that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed with these brushes is that they vary in color.  The two bigger brushes seem to be darker with a mix of some orange toned hairs as well (These brushes are made with natural goat&#x27;s hair) The smaller brushes seem to be more of an orange or light brown color than the larger brushes.  My two least favorite brushes are the big powder brushes.  They are ok, but they aren&#x27;t my favorites in the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite brushes in this set are the angled blush brush, Foundation brush, and the concealer brush.  The brushes are really soft and I haven&#x27;t experienced any fall out with them.  The way they are made give you a lot of control and precision when using to apply foundation or blush, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My set also included a lip brush, however I&#x27;ve not really used it yet but it&#x27;s a nice little addition to the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the quality if these brushes.  I think anytime you get a set of brushes you are going to have a few that work better for you than others.  Opinions on brushes can really vary from user to user because some things just work better for some than for others.  What works for some might not work for others.  Some may love these powder brushes more than the others, however I can only tell you my personal experiences and opinions.  They aren&#x27;t bad brushes at ALL, I just don&#x27;t find me picking those over other powder brushes that I own.  The best part of this set is the packaging and the faux alligator cover.  They just are simply gorgeous!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  Received Review Sampler for you than others.

    <li> These are very nice &amp; soft. They come on a fancy leather-like case &amp; then inside a neat box. It&#x27;s like a opening an expensive gift. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because 1 of the brush heads came off the handle.</li>
    <li> I love this brushes!!! The case is so fancy I love it&#x27;s design. The product arrived fast and very well packaged</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes.  The seller did contact me about the state that they would arrive and how to care for them before the first use.  Following these instructions, they are great brushes and do not smell.</li>
    <li> This came beautifully packaged! Makes a GREAT gift!</li>
    <li> Good quality and Highly recommended. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I got my set in the mail today. I was so excited I opened it immediately. Let them air out, rinsed and can&#x27;t wait to use them. They are so soft, love the carrying case as well!!</li>
    <li> Incredible is an understatement!! I love everything about this set! The carrying case can be used for so many other things. EXCELLENT presentation! Wonderful and durable brush set. These will make phenomenal gifts.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SET!  It&#x27;s HUUUUGE and magnificent!  I&#x27;m in LOVE!!! Best purchase of December 2014!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality brush set. The brushes are lightweight, sturdy, and simplistically elegant. The brush heads are superior to many of the more expensive ones my fiance has purchased in the past. The quality of the case is equally impressive with clean leather lines and snaps secure for traveling. This set would make an excellent gift if you can convince yourself to part with it after purchasing.</li>
    <li> Very nice set of makeup brushes. Soft brushes with nice handles complete with case to store them in.  Beautifully made product that we are happy with.&lt;br /&gt;As a review blogger I receive product samples at no cost or at a deeply discounted rate. Whether I pay for a product or receive a sample for review purposes my reviews are my honest opinion and I&#x27;m not financially compensated for them.</li>
    <li> Decent brushes for the price, but far from professional quality.  Good starter set.</li>
    <li> These were packaged nicely. Every brush is individually wrapped witch was nice because I bought this as a present. My niece loved them! I am very happy that I was able to get these for a review.</li>
    <li> Packaging and case  are beautiful I really love the way it was packaged. The seller warned of the chemical and leather smell but it went away very quickly. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to soak the brushes like the seller recommended so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them on my face I can tell that they are a great quality just by feeling them.</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for my girlfriend so unfortunately I can&#x27;t give a first hand review however she seemed to love it. The packaging was very nice, very gift-able and she stated that the quality of the brushes themselves were excellent. When I gave the box to her she remarked &amp;#34;Wow these are nice, I can get rid of my old crappy brushes now&amp;#34; so seemingly they&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> loveit amazing brushes</li>
    <li> Beautiful set in a lovely canister.  They appear to be good quality brushes, however the head on the foundation brush was loose and needed to be glued on to hold securely.  For some reason this has happened to every foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever owned!  Would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> They came in a really nice case.  However, as I started to take the plastic off each brush 2 of the tops of the brushes came right off.  I was so disappointed, I was hoping for a better set.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to open this lovely package. The brushes are very soft and good quality.</li>
    <li> These are just beautiful. The best quality brush set I have ever purchased. (And I&#x27;ve bought a lot!) recommend 100% to anyone, also would make a great gift as it is beautiful in its presentation.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised when receiving this 9-pc makeup brush set.  The packaging definitely says quality, the design is elegant.  The brushes are not as soft as I want, but over all I love this set.  Definitely one of the best gift sets a lady would want!</li>
    <li> Very good quality brushes!  I was very impressed with the packaging.</li>
    <li> The packaging was too cute! The brushes are if high quality and applies my make-up to perfection. High quality brushes at a reasonable price just doesn&#x27;t get any better than this. This product is highly recommended for all my make-up artist and lovers!</li>
    <li> I love love love these brushes and the travel case for them.  Such nice brushes. Works great with my make up. I&#x27;ve had no issues</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this makeup brush set!  They came in a beautiful white case that I absolutely love! The brushes are good quality and the bristles are super soft and pretty dense. I&#x27;ve washed these brushes a quite a few times now, and none of them shed. I definitely recommend these brushes! If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable makeup brush set and don&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg, try these! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Pictures look good. Not quality product. Cheap gift box..</li>
    <li> Beautiful set. These brushes have worked amazing so far. They seem to be high quality and the packaging is fantastic. I recommend these highly.</li>
    <li> Gave this brush set to my sister as a gift. She just started using it and so far she likes it. The brushes start out a bit hard but that&#x27;s to be expected. She likes it.</li>
    <li> This makeup brush kit is awesome and very nice quality. The brushes are soft and work great. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup brush set!</li>
    <li> GREAT ITEM...Great quality</li>
    <li> Very soft and nice selection. I did not notice any weird smell as some others reported. Having these brushes helps to cut down on my make-up time. I also love having a holder. Looks very pretty and femine. I definately recommend!</li>
    <li> Returned this, definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Loved this set so much! The way it comes packed is amazing! Thank you so much! Quality is amazing and super durable!</li>
    <li> These brushes are gorgeous! They feel soft and luxurious, and the sizes are great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brushes beautiful box and great quality!! Only used them once and already love them!</li>
    <li> Really nice set of brushes. Was very tempted to be selfish and keep them for myself instead of using them for the intended gift for my mother.  The case is very stylish and the grips very elegant.  Shipped very quickly too. She is going to love these.</li>
    <li> Gave these to my daughter and she loves them</li>
    <li> The brushes work very well and pick up a lot of color. They are well made (not cheap) and none of the hair comes our of the brush when you&#x27;re using them. Plus, the case is awesome! Makes traveling with the brushes really easy.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:f0ab9a1a714e2b8f09a217edf6e3508f]]This Queen B 10 piece make up brush set came in a very nice package. The box itself is very nice, clean and well made. The design of the box is really good as a gift, I&#x27;m so impressed! After opening the box, you can see a very luxurious white leather croc printed case (8 inches long). Very impressive indeed! I like how they package the brushes in a way that touches a woman&#x27;s delicate heart. One can be very lucky if given this set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the white leather croc printed case is a set of 10 make up brushes each covered with a plastic cellophane to maintain its newness. The materials, color and sizes of the brushes vary depending upon the need:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Large Face Brush is made of 100% natural goats hair, 7.5 inches;&lt;br /&gt;1 Medium Face Brush is made of 100% natural goats hair, 7 inches;&lt;br /&gt;1 Angled Blush Brush is made of premium synthetic fiber, 7.25 inches;&lt;br /&gt;1 Large Concealer Brush is made of premium synthetic fiber, 7.25 inches;&lt;br /&gt;1 Small Concealer Brush is made of premium synthetic fiber, 6.75 inches;&lt;br /&gt;1 Foam Eye Shadow Brush is made of a soft foam, 6.25 inches;&lt;br /&gt;1 Medium Angled Eye Shadow Brush is made of premium synthetic fiber, 6.75 inches;&lt;br /&gt;1 Eye Liner Brush is made of premium synthetic fiber;&lt;br /&gt;1 Eye Brow Brush/Eye Lash Comb is made of premium synthetic fiber, 6.75 inches; and&lt;br /&gt;1 Small lip brush made of synthetic fibre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the look of these brushes, these are really made by the highest quality, so soft to touch, easy to clean and keep. The handles are long, chunky, made of wood, dense, has nice grip for ease of application and has a print &amp;quot;Q&amp;quot; on it. The large and medium brushes are firmer, while the medium brush is denser too. I tried the large face brush on my mac studio powder foundation, it does good, it does not over absorb and it spreads out evenly on my face. Because of this, my powder foundation is not being wasted and it&#x27;s very important to me. The medium face brush is close to kabuki, and I just love using it! I used it on my loose powder. This angled brush is very important to me since I use it often to blend my bronzer and my blush on. It&#x27;s so soft and easy to apply and blend on my face. Since I put on my liquid foundation first after putting on my moisturizer, I use this large concealer brush for it. I does good, it blends the liquid foundation evenly from the side of the face, to my forehead to my chin and then to my cheeks, nose and neck. I have no complaints so far. This foam eyeshadow brush is very nice especially if you want to apply it accurately. This is not anymore common nowadays since most of the free eyeshadow applicator is made of synthetic brushes. I&#x27;m not really good in applying eyeshadow that&#x27;s why I prefer this foam brush. I tried the eyebrow brush and it does well in spreading my brow liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very much satisfied with this set of brushes. My vanity pleasure! I highly recommend it! I can never find a very nice white croc leather printed case elsewhere much more with the quality of the brushes. It makes me feel beautiful and young all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest opinion.he medium face brush is close to kabuki, and I just love using it!

    <li> yes, it is a stunning tool set. beautiful package and super soft brushes. high quality and fine craftsman.</li>
    <li> Love. Love. Love! The case is super cute and the brushes are perfect!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, awesome make up brush, great for a gift, the brush holder is very strong and sturdy and not like the cheap ones.  Great quality</li>
    <li> OMG, I got these brushes Saturday and they&#x27;re amazing!  They feel so soft, the case is such high quality and all the brushes came individually wrapped which kept their shape!  I am so proud of these brushes and look forward to years of use out of them!  Great quality and great price!</li>
    <li> Beautiful leather case! Good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE!!!! The case was so cool. High end looking and made of leather. These brushes work great!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Comes in a very stylish good quality embossed case. It has every brush I need for my daily makeup routine.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes!! I love the container they come in! Perfect for traveling and for keeping the safe and clean! The brushes are beautiful for powder eye shadows and veryGREAT QUALITY! I definitely recommend these brushes for anyone looking for them!</li>
    <li> This is a great gift for a makeup lover! It comes with every brush you could want or need. The travel case is an added bonus. The only thing bad I have to say is that they do smell a but funky when you first take them out. The chemically smell goes away, however.</li>
    <li> Love be these brushes!!!  Great quality!</li>
    <li> I gave these to my granddaughter as a gift.  She loves them.  She just needs to figure out what each one is for now. Comes in nice case.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE these brushes! They are by far one of my most favorite purchases ever on Amazon! So soft and no fall outs whatsoever! Even the case it made very well... I&#x27;m 100% happy with this and will DEFINITELY be recommending them to all my friends!</li>
    <li> These brushes are GORGEOUS! They feel incredibly soft and luxurious, and the sizes are great for so many different make-up uses. The quality is exceptional especially in terms of the price point. I just love using them -- and they&#x27;re also a great gift for girlfriends who are into luxury, beauty, and pampering!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes. As an artist, right out of the box the attention to detail with the look and design of the brushes and leather case caught my attention. Gorgeous, gorgeous set! Each brush has the softest hairs and leaves a really believable makeup application.The brush handles fit comfortably in my hands and I am just really satisfied with these. I find myself feeling pampered and really enjoying my makeup application process.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! I&#x27;ve been needing good quality brushes for a long time and so glad I got these. I love how thick the handles of the brushes are. They are very soft as well. And the brush holder is so cute!</li>
    <li> These has been one of the great finds i purchased. Definitely love them! esp the case. High quality and not cheap looking. The brushes are excellent and awesome to use. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Nicely packaged. I would recommend them. Great communication from the seller.</li>
    <li> Great quality brush set.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for quality brushes to replace my cheap old ones and I took a shot with these. They arrived quickly and before the estimated delivery date. I was not disappointed! These are by far one of the best quality in makeup brushes I have tried! Definitely worth the money. The case it comes in is also very cute and durable, perfect to toss in my bag or store in my makeup counter.</li>
    <li> Awosome product fast shipping loved it</li>
    <li> Beautiful set. Brushes are so soft. Can not wait to use them!</li>
    <li> These brushes are everything! I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the case and the brushes! I originally planned to give these as a Christmas gift. But after receiving them, I&#x27;m keeping them for myself! I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> This makeup set is high quality and has everything you need!</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes, good quality with a very nice, quality leather case. The company also did a follow-up email to ensure satisfaction and give tips for cleaning.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter and she absolutely loves them. No little hairs falling out  beat of all she loved the case. Says it&#x27;s easy to store on her counter and still looks good. No fumbling with a bag searching for the right brush. I am very pleased that this product works so well for her.</li>
    <li> A woman can never have to many makeup brushes. I firmly believe that statement too. This was such a beautiful set of brushes. The packaging made it feel even more luxurious. The box has a beautifully written quote by Coco Chanel which I LOVED! The box is also a magnetic close box and tied elegantly together by a satin silver ribbon. Once you open the box you are exposed to a beautiful solid white leather case with 2 buttons snaps on each side. Seriously the packaging on this was my favorite part! The brushes are individually wrapped on the inside to help hold their structure and quality. The heads and bristles on each brush are very soft, actually some of the softer ones I have come across in a while. The handles are very well made so no need to worry about loose glue and wiggly brushes, which I can&#x27;t stand! The brushes shed very minimally which is another reason I really loved this set. When you first open the set it will smell of leather but let it air out for 15 minutes or so and that smell disappears. The smell doesn&#x27;t effect the quality a bit, I like to think of it as the new car smell except with makeup brushes and leather. I would have loved to see a few other brushes in this set as the quality are great and there are some eye brushes I would have liked included in the quality of this set. This is a great starter set if you are just beginning or if you are very simple with your makeup. The more you start experimenting the more you will need other shaped brushes that are not included in this set but for the quality and price the other brushes are great for any skill set! *I received this product free/discounted in exchange for my review. My reviews are completely honest and 100% my own.*</li>
    <li> Was a great xmas gift for the beginner make up diva! Case is good quality also.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, no shedding, no smell, nice case. Would make a wonderful gift.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, I bought them during a promotion and was surprised with the quality and how great the product was.</li>
    <li> Love these Brushes! There is literally one for every type of make up you would like to apply, and they work great! Super soft but firm enough to apply make up appropriately.</li>
    <li> When I received the brushes, the pretty box they came in was so impressive and of high quality, that in itself was worth the purchase.  The email the seller sent before receiving the brushes explained in detail how to care for them.  The stiffness they mentioned was slight and if you followed their instructions, the care of the brushes will keep them in good condition for long use. Although I have yet to use the brushes, I would most certainly recommend this seller for any product.</li>
    <li> Great! Except one of them came apart, but I just glued it back and no more problems.</li>
    <li> These brushes are incredibly soft and the packaging is nice.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes, would recommend, goes on smooth!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves them. Works just as well as the other expensive brands, according to her.</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes. They are nice and soft. The case comes in handy. Fits nicely in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Super soft, yet strong. Came in the cutest and most functional carrying case. These brushes are well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> These are nice full brushes.  I like them a lot.  My make up application goes on smoothly.  However, the container they came in smells so strongly of chemicals.  Very strong chemical smell.</li>
    <li> These brushes surprised me as they are nicer than I thought they will be. The 9 inch imitation crocodile leather white round hard case is gorgeous to look at and also acts as a storage and holder for the brushes. It looks really nice on the dressing table or white bathroom countertops. The brushes are a good length and have sturdy and thick mother of pearl handles that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are dense and soft and pick up a good quantity of makeup. They don&#x27;t poke my skin like some other brushes I&#x27;ve tried. The larger and smaller powder brush are made of natural hair and smaller ones are synthetic. When I first pulled out the natural hair brushes they had a strong adhesive smell but it has worn off since. Sometimes there are only 1 or 2 good brushes in a set but all these brushes are very usable and work well. It&#x27;s also the right brushes, all of these will get used regularly.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best! They are a fantastic value! They are comparable to my clinique make up brushes! So excited about this purchase. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Beautiful, elegant set with incredibly soft brushes!  Very pleased with this set and will buy from here again!!</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the eye shadow brushes.</li>
    <li> Cute leather case for the brushes! Case might have a leathery smell but if you follow directions, the case is actually very handy and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room. Received this order very fast!</li>
    <li> Hi, these brushes are great! I love them, they are so soft and the case is perfect!!! Thank you for the fast shipping also. 😍</li>
    <li> I have been on the search for a nice set of makeup brushes and have to admit, these are amazing. Luv these brushes and would totally recommend it to those looking for a good set of make up brushes.</li>
    <li> Order arrived on time and was of better value than what i expected</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful from the brushes all the way to the case! Very classy, and elegant</li>
    <li> fast delivery, great product</li>
    <li> Brushes are definitely a soft good quality feel!!</li>
    <li> I been wanting a set of brushes for the longest time. I really like the color and the case it came with. They feel soft on my skin. And apply makeup very well.</li>
    <li> These are very nice, high quality brushes. The case is made of genuine leather while the handles on the brushes are beautifully white and shiny with the QueenB logo on them, a Q with a crown on top of it. The bristles are very soft and help apply my makeup flawlessly. The company included an extra lip brush with my order, and it was also very nice with a precise tip that helped me apply my lip color flawlessly. I highly recommend these makeup brushes and think they are well worth the money, especially since you get a one year warranty on them and the company is very customer friendly.</li>
    <li> Great set! My wife loves them!</li>
    <li> These are really nice for the price. I&#x27;m not used to using anything too expensive and I don&#x27;t use them often, but these made everything go on really smooth.</li>
    <li> absolutely great brush set</li>
    <li> I just received this today! Before I got my order, I received instructions on how to handle/care for the brushes--which was a major plus. It does have a smell (I am guessing from manufacturing) when you first open it, but that goes away within 10 minutes after you leave it to air-out. So it&#x27;s no big deal at all. The brush case is sturdy so it can hold all of the brushes without any problems. I can easily pack all of my brushes for a trip without any worries of the case getting crushed. The brushes are very soft on the skin. I did not notice any shedding so that is also a plus. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. This was an awesome deal.</li>
    <li> absolutely love these will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for daily use... Love my brushes!</li>
    <li> Cute packaging and quick shipping! Thank you! will be giving this as a stocking stuffer for my cousin who likes to do make up!</li>
    <li> Great brushes and love the case they come in.</li>
    <li> Wow these makeup brushes are so soft! When I received them in the mail I was so excited especially because of the Brush holder and then the Brushes . They smelled a bit like acetone then I aired them out overnight and the smell wore off. I also washed them and not one of these brushes shedded. I really like the design of these brushes with the queen B logo. I&#x27;m always looking for sturdy soft brushes and these are it ! The feeling I get when I put them on my face ahhh so nice!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing brush set! It comes in a beautiful, white, leather-ish case that perfectly holds the brushes and has two button clasps on the side for easy access. The brushes themselves are the great basics that every woman needs in her kit. I&#x27;ve been primarily using the kind of flat-top one as a foundation/stipple brush. The bristles are very soft, and the brush itself is very dense, so it deposits the foundation extremely well and in a flawless, natural way. My only complaint is that there is a lot of brush fall-out. Large and small bristles often fall out onto my face when I am putting on my foundation, but other than that, amazing purchase - these brushes are softer and of better quality than some of my department store brushes!    I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> Nice brush set and comes in a lovely case. They smell a bit chemically when you first get them, but after a quick wash and air dry you are good to go. The seller will include instructions on how to care for your brushes also, which is nice. Would buy these again.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this makeup brush set! It&#x27;s cute and I love the case it comes with. I would buy again. If anyone&#x27;s reading this you should buy it!!!</li>
    <li> I am beyond impressed with the quality of these brushes, the packaging, and the lightning fast shipping by the seller. The box the set comes in is very sturdy. This is not flimsy or ugly cardboard. Inside, a leather cylinder with snap closures contains the brushes neatly and beautifully. I literally gasped in surprise at seeing how elegant this set looked. The bristles are secure, even after I tugged on them a few times. (I&#x27;ve bought brushes before where the bristles fell off during first use.) My only complaint is that the handles themselves smelled very strongly of paint thinner/acetone when I first opened the case. It was noticeable enough that I had to soak them and then dry them outside in order to get rid of the scent. It does nothing to take away from the quality of the product or my extreme satisfaction at having ordered them.</li>
    <li> Tried this product due to a posting I saw on social media &amp; decided to give it a try. Very pleased that I did. Totally love these brushes! Very soft, easy to use &amp; apply you makeup. Brush hairs do not break or fall out like other brushes I have purchased. Have suggested these brushes to multiple friends &amp; family.</li>
    <li> I was expecting very little from these brushes.  Instead, I was extremely surprised with what we received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush set comes with a total of 9 brushes in a very nice case that can be used for travel or as a stand up holder.  The brushes are very good quality with good handles.  The heads are dense and full and worked with all mediums.  The brushes apply any product evenly and consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When first unsealed, there is a slight smell. We let the brushes air out overnight and we the smell was gone.</li>
    <li> Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Great brushes. Designed beautifully. Case is gorgeous! I really wanted this. I think this is my favorite set of brushes by far. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> It is awesome.  Luxury case and brushes.  It worths any penny.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes. Superior quality</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! I was very excited to get them in the mail. They come in a beautiful gift box and they are made of great quality material. They are sturdy and well made. Plus they come in a beautiful croc design case to store them. I am very happy with the brushes! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I was excited when I saw the box this set came in. It&#x27;s packaged really pretty. I love the white leather case. The brushes are very soft and pretty. When I opened they had a strong smell. The seller emailed me about the smell before hand and all I had to do was let them air outfit about 15 minutes and the smell was gone. I appreciate them contacting me for little tips. I love this set.</li>
    <li> These are awesome and not to mention the cutest case they are in!!! I purchased these at a promotional price for my review... Nice textured bristles nice quality and again love love the case There is a brush for everything plus some</li>
    <li> This is a great travel brush set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I went to an out of town wedding and of course she needed to do her makeup. Normally she would have to take her big tackle sized kit to complete the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All she packed was this brush kit and a compact with her favorite colors. She was able to easily get the job done with these brushes. She stated that the brushes were very very soft and no hairs came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best is the supplied caring box, which makes it easy to slip into a suitcase.</li>
    <li> I ordered these expecting regular make up brushes. Nothing special. But when I got the package it came in s beautiful white case and I was so excited! I opened and saw all the brushes and could wait to try them. Not surprisingly, they worked like a charm. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!! Highly recommend! Got them at a great price and they work just as good if not better than them high dollar cosmetic brands.</li>
    <li> I had heard good things from my friends about this brand, but was hesitant to change from my current brushes. I am very glad I decided to make the switch. The quality is very nice. I have been using these exclusively since purchasing them and couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
    <li> These brushes are unbelievable. Yes there is a strong smell when opening but they explain to undo them and so forth. Awesome set for any makeup lover.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my beloved for Christmas and she loves it. She uses it everyday. The brushes are firm, but not too firm, it still gives you that quality brisels youre looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you wash it prior using it since it does have an odor upon arrival.</li>
    <li> High quality product! Arrived in 2 days with prime shipping. Wish I had ordered more for my friends and family, this would make a great gift!</li>
    <li> High quality,very smooth to use</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are really nice quality.  I will probably end up purchasing more as gifts.  The box they come in is really sweet and then the white case is wonderful too.  Great way to store them so they don&#x27;t get dirty.  Plus the brushes are all really nice and work great!</li>
    <li> I have just received my brushes and wow! What an impressive presentation  - from the ribboned box to the beautiful tube carrying case. Then I  used two of the  brushes, one natural bristle  and one synthetic. Both worked smoothly and did not shed! Oh, I love the handle shape and length...so easy to use.  Can&#x27;t wait to employ the other brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!  Great price, quality and prompt delivery.  Am ordering another set for my daughter.  Wish more companies were as great as this.</li>
    <li> These luxurious brushes are amazing! The case looks great and the brushes feel so soft. They did contain a scent from the manufacturing process a bit longer than what the manufacturer had warned, but after about three days they were absolutely perfect. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them!</li>
    <li> Get product came in a beautiful holding case. I also love the price. Just lovely</li>
    <li> These are great brushes, I waited a north or so before writing a review just to see how they hold up. I love them. Yes had a strong smell apon opening but after leaving them open for a day or two they were fine</li>
    <li> Not only are these nice and quality brushes, but they come arrived in a gift box with a bow, then you open it to find your white &amp;#34;animal print&amp;#34; storage case! The packaging is top notch! And the brushes are just great! You will NOT be disapointed! I think these would also make the perfect gift..... for yourself! :)</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with these brushes!!!  They are as good, if not better, than some of the more high end brushes I&#x27;ve bought at Sephora, Meril Norman or Este Lauder!!!!  Worth the money for sure, they apply make-up fantastic and the bristles/hairs are extremely soft so they don&#x27;t scratch your face as some brushes do.... I love the leather carrying case/holder, it is absolutely adorable on it&#x27;s own!!!  If you&#x27;re thinking of spending big bucks on the more expensive brands don&#x27;t this is just as good and at a fraction of the cost!!!!</li>
    <li> I must admit that I thought  I would be getting something different. I was quite surprised and excited when my Luxury 10 piece Makeup Brush Set arrived. It truly is premium quality product. It looks fancy. Love the brushes for blush and the eye brow comb especially. The brushes are very soft on my skin and very easy to apply make up with.&lt;br /&gt;I love the container that the set came it. I can just sit it on my bathroom counter and leave my makeup brushes right there. The White Leather (croc print) makes a nice decoration in my bathroom. Even the carry case it arrived in is very exquisite.&lt;br /&gt;I was honored to be able to receive this product for testing and reviewing.</li>
    <li> The box and the case the brushes come in look really professional and beautiful. This would make a wonderful gift for someone! The quality of the brushes were of similar quality to my Estee Lauder Brushes. I would have liked to see wooden handles instead of plastic. I do think the price is a little high on them, but I would order these again!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes... really soft!</li>
    <li> Wonderful set of makeup brushes for all your makeup applying . They are high quality and come in a beautiful easy to store case , for travel or home .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are a premium synthetic and natural hair brushes that  hold powder as well as liquid cosmetics beautifully.These are comparable to other professional makeup brush sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes have special. longer handles and denser, fuller brush heads that release just the right amount of make up onto your skin.These brushes leave your skin smooth and gently and flawlessly distribute the liquid and powder and Mineral based makeup. These brushes leave your skin happy and evenly covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for everyone to have in your makeup kit.</li>
    <li> Love it! This Brush Set is very soft!</li>
    <li> Now the good. The packaging is lovely. I had somebody order these for me so I&#x27;ve added photos to prove I truly do own these. U end up with two cases which is the best thing about these.The brush case has a strong smell which doesn&#x27;t seem to want to go away and if had them almost a month. Now, I&#x27;ve already written to the company and iv been completely ignored. Maybe I got a bad set but the natural hair brushes are the most horrible brushes iv ever met in my life. The other brushes are ok. But the powder brushes are STINKY and SUPER SCRATCHY. iv shampooed them. Didn&#x27;t work. I even tried to condition them. With conditioner. Olive oil. Nothing. Still rough and still smelly. You don&#x27;t need anybody to tell you this is goat hair. You can smell it. And the icing on the cake? Brushes are already coming apart.iv had these for about 3 weeks. And I don&#x27;t use them cuz they smell and don&#x27;t feel good in the least. And already falling apart? I want my money back pronto or a better brush set. This is just ridiculous. Im beyond disappointed. I&#x27;m livid!</li>
    <li> I love the brushes!  They feel like silk and I love the thickness of the handles as it makes for better control of the brushes.  Love the bonus lip brush too! The design of the case is gorgeous!  The only things I would have like to see on the brushes is labeling of what type of brush each brush is and also the option for different colors for the brushes. It would be a 5-star rating with these additions.</li>
    <li> Very Nice,  great quality brushes!</li>
    <li> Impressed with the quality of the brushes. The case is so handy as it holds all the brushes and has a cover to protect from dust, etc. Great started set.</li>
    <li> Got these brushes and honestly they are not the best. You can find these same exact brushes lower than $10 here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Purchased this as a Xmas gift for my wife. I can&#x27;t wait for the look on her face when she opens this. Will def buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase. I have been looking for some brushes and these are exactly what I was looking for. The are soft . And I love the case. They are made well. Great quality not cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes and I LOVE them! They&#x27;re very good quality brushes. I would definitely recommend these to friends and family.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are beautiful and soft. I love that they come with a compact but pretty case. They will be perfect for traveling!</li>
    <li> Great brushes!! Soft bristles. Would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this set if brushes!!!! They are soft and easy to carry in the white oval holder!! Definitely recommend them!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are great quality! I normally use mac brushes, and I like these a lot!</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft!! The case alone is worth it. It is such a nice case and a decent size. These brushes work well and are the perfect size.</li>
    <li> I actually got this set through an IG coupon.  My daughter LOVES it. The brushes are great and such an elegant case. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush set, impressed with the quality.</li>
    <li> At first, I was skeptical about the brushes because I am always told &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34; I paid such a minimal amount and thought to myself, if nothing else they&#x27;ll make great back ups. Well, I was wrong. I took them out of the package and let them breathe, washed them up, and the next day I gave them a shot. These brushes replaced my expensive department store brushes. I will never buy those &amp;#34;top brands&amp;#34; again knowing I can get BETTER quality at an AFFORDABLE price. If you&#x27;re a make-up junkie these are for you. Order them, and just throw those old ones away.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the box I knew I would love them. They are packaged in a beautiful fold out box, they come in a pearly white carrying case. I used them today for the first time and I loved them. They are very soft and pick up the right amount of foundation, eyeshadow (pigment)  I also have to say that they have great customer service. I had to contact them, not for a negative reason but just a simple question and I received a reply within minutes. LOVE IT.. A company who is prompt on their response definitely cares for their clients.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes makes applying my makeup so much easier.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting for this makeup brush set to be anything special but I was pleasantly surprised. Even the white box the case comes in is nice. The leather case the brushes come in is gorgeous! The smell, not so good but I did air out as other reviewers suggested and I don&#x27;t have that issue too much now. There is still a very slight smell but tolerable. I expect that it may go away after even more time has passed. I really wish the bristle brushes were softer. This is why I took one star off. I have a brush from bella terra Mineral Cosmetics that I use to apply my mineral foundation and the bristles on that brush is very soft. I will probably continue to use my Bella brush more than the big brush in this set to apply my fondation but I will still use the other one from time to time and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get a lot of uses out of the other brushes in the set. All in All I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Got these for my wife when there was a promotional discount. She loves them, and recommends them.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. A perfect gift for a teenager.</li>
    <li> Super high quality brushes! Love it.  I received special pricing for this set and amazed at the quality.</li>
    <li> Sorry, not so happy about the product.  I followed the instructions as what the seller said but the brush just didn&#x27;t work for me, I  hate to return it coz I  already use it.  Three brushes  are wobbly then it shed the hair the first  three days I use it then the foundation brush don&#x27;t give me a clean finish. Bought this coz it was rated five star but just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I like the case though.</li>
    <li> These are the best makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. They arrived quickly, were beautifully packaged and I absolutely love the case they are in. These would make a great gift for any girl who loves her makeup. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I usually buy very expensive Mac makeup brushes.  I am so glad i gave these a try. These are just as good for a far better value. This is something everyone who wears makeup should treat themselves too.  They feel like silk against your skin.  I also love the case they come in!</li>
    <li> Great Brush set....cant beat the price!</li>
