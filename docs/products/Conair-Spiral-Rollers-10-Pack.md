<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the waves but I wish the rollers were comfortable enough to sleep on.  I rarely have time to air-dry my long hair in rollers, and I prefer to avoid heat styling products, which is why I ordered these in the first place.</li>
    <li> I do a &amp;#34;spray with water and roll over night heatless curl&amp;#34;, i wanted something easier/softer to sleep in. Even covered with a bandanna, the hair loosens once dried and they unroll enough to ruin the curl. i&#x27;m sticking with my rigid silicone covered rollers for now. (the hair stays tightly wrapped even after the hair dries)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May work for a &amp;#34;during the day&amp;#34; drying session, but i needed them for overnight</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s quick and easy i put them right before bed (conformable to sleep in) and take them out in the morning for perfect waves or curls I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I have only used them once so far; however, I plan to use them regularly because they were so easy and stayed very well. I only had one fall out and I think that was more due to lack of experience than anything else.</li>
    <li> Worked great for me. I have thin, naturally straight hair and these curlers gave me EXTREMELY tight curls. After letting them sit for a while and brushing it out, it was a very beautiful curl.</li>
    <li> I think it work good, does the job for what you pay, great product I recommended for other costumer who want to get it but they are not sure if will work, it work for me.</li>
    <li> It gives me just the curls I want</li>
    <li> Bigger curls, fabulous style!</li>
    <li> really love these rollers!!!!</li>
    <li> I put these in after towel drying my hair and left them in for about 4 hours until my hair was completely dry. My curls came out soft and extremely bouncy. Once I loosened them up with my fingers a bit, I sprayed them with hair spray and I was all set! These are great if you want curls without the damaging heat of a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I think these work best with slightly damp hair, but they also work ok for dry hair. I slept in them, and they didn&#x27;t bother me at all, which was surprising. They didn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair or anything. Easy to put in on my own.</li>
    <li> The curls these flexi rods create are beautiful, but the wires started to come out within 4 uses. I have goody flexi rods that I have used for over 2 years and have not had any problem with those. A bummer, really.</li>
    <li> I really love these curlers! they give gorgeous curls that i could never get with a curling iron! the only thing is they are really uncomfortable to sleep in..i still recomened them and will continue to use them but just beware that they arent comfortable to sleep on!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is just above my shoulders. It also does not hold curls when done with a curling iron (withn 30 min it&#x27;s back to it&#x27;s limp, straight self). These rollers are wonderful! I take 1.5&amp;#34; sections of hair, spray them with water a couple times, wind them around the rollers, and leave them in for a few hours to dry. My curls come out wonderfully, and they last longer than I have ever had curls last. I need ~10-14 rollers for my hair, depending on how large of sections I use.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin, straight, and fine. The first time i used these rods, i put them at the bottom of my hair and rolled it up while wrapping hair around it till i got to my roots and then bent the sides in. I didn&#x27;t know that this was not the ideal way to use it. But anyways, let me just tell u about that way also, even though it may be considered the incorrect way. The ends of my hair didn&#x27;t fall out this way, because they were the first things i rolled up and they were secure under all the other hair. With this way, it comes out as kinda messy and un-uniform curls similar to a traditional curling iron but not as pretty and some didn&#x27;t even curl. I would have to work with what i had, and everyday was something different. It looked decent and even good on most days, and then there were some days where it looked perfect. On the days when my hair come out bad, i could still get some use out of the hair style by scrunching it with mousse and going for that tousled look. It still looked pretty good. I also recommend these simply for scrunching. I use 3 rods on each side of my head, and I split my hair down the middle. I dont section it in layers of anything,i just act as if i was making a braid on each side of my head (3 pieces). Even if u use them the &amp;#34;incorrect way&amp;#34; they still look good, and for me, It&#x27;s better than wearing my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Now to the &amp;#34;correct way&amp;#34; of using them. There&#x27;s a lot of vids on youtube, just search up hair spiral rollers/rods. You put the rod near ur roots and wrap the hair around the rod like a curling wand, then bend in the sides of the rod. This way created MUCH better curls ,similar to a curling wand, but more messy than if u were using a curling wand. The ends also would come out a lot. Just try to wrap the hair so the end reaches almost the end of the rod and then bend the rod next to the end of hair and squeeze it so it stays. Also, put something over ur hair like a twistie turban, or scarf to keep it secure. Sometimes the ends of the hair don&#x27;t curl bc they fall out, but when that happens i add extra hairspray to the ends and scrunch it so it gets shorter and becomes the same length as the other fully formed curls and adds some curl/wave instead of a straight end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  These honestly are not comfy to sleep it, but you just have to find the right position depending on where the rods are on ur head. I put the rods in when may hair is basically dry because if i put them in wet, most of the time it wont dry completely and the curl wont fully form. With these rollers, its very quick and easy to get ur hair ready in the morning. What I do it just take them out, put my head upside down and shake my hair at the roots with my hand to separate the curls (DONT brush them out), then bring my head right side up again. If they get messy from shaking the roots, i just lightly smooth them with my hands, then i hairspray them and ur good to go. Though, for me i have to tease my roots bc my hair is flat and greasy, and i do that before i hairspray. But i dont think most people would have to tease. I wear the curls everyday to school. And even with hairspray, they do fall by the end of the day, but they still look presentable. I would recommend these. I took off one star though bc the ends of the my hair do fall out of the rod quite often.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my 11 year old as she wants to add curls to her hair.  They work great!</li>
    <li> Worked great for me, don&#x27;t understand why people say they didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t stay in very well and you have to realllly tie down a scarf over your head and smoosh them down or they won&#x27;t stay in at all, next time I will do it will barely damp hair, hopefully works better.</li>
    <li> This is REALLY amazing!!!^_^ I WILL recommend this product to my family and friends even my teachers!!! I have Free Two-days Shipping so that I can get it quickly, and it is ABSOLUTELY useful!!! And I ABSOLUTELY love it!!! It ABSOLUTELY works GREAT!!! Thanks so much!!! ^_^</li>
    <li> I dampened my hair slightly and put the rollers in.  Got ready as usual and right before I left took them out, shook my hair, and I had nice waves all day long!  They even lasted through wind, cold, and sleep.  If you have more time you could leave them in even longer for tighter/bigger curls.  So simple and the curl/wave actually stays in!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s waist-length hair.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find curlers soft enough to allow her to sleep on them, yet hard enough to allow for an even curl.  Suffice to say these rods do both with style.  She complained a little the first night she slept on them, but after she saw the curls, she insisted on having her hair done the second night!  Be sure to use styling gel on long hair, though.  Also, the rods are easily removed, with very, very few tangles.</li>
    <li> They say &amp;#34;colors may vary&amp;#34; and they were right.  I received the bright neon green everyone seems to love...except me!!  Why do they do that??  Maybe that&#x27;s why the good price...</li>
    <li> After straightening and burning my hair all throughout high school, I wanted to be nice to my hair and use heat when only absolutely necessary. Since I never really mastered the curling iron anyway, I figured I&#x27;d give these rollers a try. They are a bit uncomfortable to sleep in, but they produce great curls that last all day! Don&#x27;t put the rollers in until your hair is just slightly damp; any wetter and the curls will not dry over night and you&#x27;ll just end up with waves in the morning.</li>
    <li> It arrive soon and I like it! I&#x27;m planning use them sometimes to curl my hair and don&#x27;t hit it very much with the curl hair iron</li>
    <li> this is actually really good for your hair since you use no heat but it works best if your hair is either slightly dry or just a little wet and it works best when you sleep with them on or if you&#x27;re going to have them on for a long time. but other than that, you can get 2 great looks with this and i worth the money! :)</li>
    <li> The result I usually suspect is the tight spiral curl. I personally am not a fan of tight spiral curls. My hair shortened to my shoulders. However, the reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I feel that I am not damaging my hair as compared to when I use a curling iron. I still use spiral curlers to achieve body and loose curls in my hair by quickly (quickly, quickly!) running the straightening iron over them. (Skip to the bottom for a conclusion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These spiral curlers really create a beautiful spiral, if you like them tight. I had them in my wet hair for about 12 hours the first time. I put mousse in my hair to hold the curl, and I loved the result! My hair is 3 inches past shoulder length, very fine, and doesn&#x27;t hold a heated curl for more than 20 minutes. To achieve the look I like, I ran my straightening iron over them quickly. It created the perfect body and curl for an easy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the curlers with mousse again for the next day, &amp; slept in them for 7 hours. The curl didn&#x27;t turn out for me. It wasn&#x27;t even the simple, easy, laid- back curls look I usually go for. It became a hassel to fix my \\&quot;bad hair day.\\&quot; They definitely weren&#x27;t as great as the first day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these curlers yet again for a third time to see where the medium ground was. This time I wore the curlers for 4 hours before going to bed for 8&#x3D; total 12 hours in my hair. When I woke up, I saw the same result as the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Conclusion) So, if you like quick, easy, tight curls without heat, then these are for you! If you like a quick hairstyle with looser curls like me, then they are still for you; just do as I described. Another great plus about these curlers is that they held the curl longer than a heated curl! I use about 10 curlers total. I recommend this product because it&#x27;s so easy and fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps (:</li>
    <li> I watched a ton of YouTube videos on these rollers, and everyone loved them, so I went ahead and bought a package. Maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing something right, but I was not crazy about the results. I don&#x27;t have 3 hours to let my hair dry in these in the morning, so my plan was to sleep with them. I found them to be incredibly uncomfortable. Also, no matter how I well I secured them, I would always lose 1 or 2 in my sleep. My hair that did curl was extremely dull and had no shine to it whatsoever. The curl I was left with was fluffy and my hair was left  poofy on the sides but volumeless on the top.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these for everyone to try out because of all the positive reviews I have seen on them. However, this product just did not work for me and my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Soooooo cool - love these things!  I had tried some cheaper ones at our local Sally store but they didn&#x27;t hold tight enough to stay closed.  This brand is the best!!</li>
    <li> These spiral curlers work great! Depending on how you put them in you get different hair styles! If you put the curler in front if your hair you get big locks if you put it behind you will get spiral curls! I have very thick hair and its a little past my shoulders it still works and looks better and is easier than using a curler! I deffinatly recommend getting these!</li>
    <li> I have a learning curve that I have not accomplished here. I&#x27;m going to try to return this and instead get \\&quot;curl formers\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, but I was looking for a heat-free way to tame some of my unruly strands.  However, I found it extremely difficult to &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; these curlers so they stayed in my hair.  They unravelled too easily for my liking.</li>
    <li> These made very tight curls.  I look like Shirley Temple when I wake up.  My hair is to my waist, and after curling, it is just below my shoulders.  Plus, it is a bit hard to get even curls.  What you end up with is RosanRosannaDanna hair.  Should just tie with rags like when I was a kid.</li>
    <li> You need to start out with dry hair. If your hair is too damp it won&#x27;t ever get dry. Spritz the ends of your hair with some water once or twice, not very much. You could add some product but it isn&#x27;t necessary. Leave in conditioner, shine anti-frizz serum, gel or mousse. Whatever you normally use. Take a small pea sized amount in your hand and run it through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can create curls two different ways. You can take a 1-2 inch section of hair, twist the hair and wind it around the width of the roller, then bend the ends of the roller in to secure it. Another way to use them is to place the roller at the ends of your hair. Wrap the ends around the roller to get it started then roll it up. If you have layers make sure to check for loose bits of hair and wrap those back in. Then bend the ends of the roller to secure it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrapping your hair with a scarf or a satin sleep cap will help keep your rollers in place while you sleep. When you wake up in the morning to take them out you&#x27;ll have perfect curls that last all day. The best part about these rollers, besides being incredibly easy to use and get curls, is that you aren&#x27;t damaging your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other rollers that had to be secured with pins or clips. They were heavy and hurt my scalp, and unwrapping my hair resulted in a massive knot. Hot tools never really gave me the desired results I wanted. There was always some strand of hair I missed or one curl was tighter than the other. I don&#x27;t have any of those problems with foam rollers. It takes all the guess work out and gives you healthy curly hair.</li>
    <li> These curlers help create a great hair do. It helps to wear a night cap over the curlers through the night.</li>
    <li> Very easy! Cute more of a tight natural curl but still love. Not hard to to sleep or use.</li>
    <li> I ordered these after seeing a cute Pinterest tutorial, and they do a pretty decent job of getting a medium-sized curl in. It&#x27;s difficult to keep the curl smooth when you&#x27;re pulling them out--I found I had to kind of gently unwrap them away from my head without keeping any tension on them. The bendable aspect was fine, but didn&#x27;t bend as tightly as I would have liked to keep them really secure without a hairnet.</li>
    <li> These things suck to sleep in, but I&#x27;m sure if you put them in a strategic way it would be fine.  These make such great curls!  I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair and these really make it possible for me to get curly hair without the damage</li>
    <li> Need Two packs per person.</li>
    <li> Always wanted spiral rollers. These are great, I want them in a smaller size for my natural hair. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Not sure there&#x27;s anything wrong with these rollers. I was looking for them in the first place because my fine, wavy (frizzy) hair is out of control and I&#x27;m tired of beating it into submission with a hot flat-iron or rollers. I found these a little difficult to secure, but I think even with my crazy hair and layered cut I could get the ends to stay with tissue on the ends. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll work that hard at it, because the three or four times I&#x27;ve tried them my hair came out MUCH curlier than I wanted. My hair holds a curl really well (not always a good thing), so it just may be that &amp;#34;beachy waves&amp;#34; are not in my future. Still think they&#x27;re worth a shot for the money. It&#x27;s not them - it&#x27;s me. :D</li>
    <li> I have very thin and fine hair, but I like to wear it long.  Curling it is the best way to get lots of volume, but my hair doesn&#x27;t always hold a curl for very long.  With these, I just shower in the evening and let my hair air-dry for a few minutes.  Then I put in a small dab of mouse and roll these all throughout my hair.  I only use five per side, but that&#x27;ll be different according to the thickness of your hair.  They are fairly uncomfortable to sleep on, but usually I can find a reasonable position that isn&#x27;t too bad.  The next morning, when I take them out,  my hair is super curly, but it&#x27;s all very even and looks like I used a curling iron!  The next day, I just comb my hair with a wide-toothed comb and enjoy more loose curls all day long. On day 3,  I re-comb gently and have loose beachy waves.  I love how fast and easy it is to now have curly hair, without damaging my hair!</li>
    <li> These worked but not really for my hair type. My hair is very thick and it is layered so they didn&#x27;t stay in at all. When they did stay in they did curl my hair.</li>
    <li> These really didnt work for me. I have straight hair (hence wanting curls...) and i just cannot get it to stay around these curlers. I tried tying two of them together with hair ties for a larger curl and they still won&#x27;t hold my hair. I might finally get one in and then it will just fall out of my hair. Too bad, I really wanted these to work.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and it gives me nice waves when I brush out. I use them with dry hair and put oil on my ends so it&#x27;s slightly wet. The rollers have a scent that also comes off in my hair /: and it&#x27;s not comfortable to sleep in this.</li>
    <li> These probably do as described on LONG hair.  On short hair, there is just no &amp;#34;grabbiness&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;stickosity&amp;#34; to make them stay in.  My advice is that if you order these for your long hair, don&#x27;t impulsively cut your hair short while awaiting the delivery.  It will be very anti-climatic...</li>
    <li> This product really does do what it says it does.  It leaves very beautiful shiny wavy curls that are very soft.  The reason why I ranked it 4 stars is because when you take them of it leaves the rollers wrinkly, but they are reusable.  I really do recommend this product to people that have long hair but if you have short hair, 1\\&quot; past your shoulders w/ layers it might be a bit difficult (like it was for me).  But overall it&#x27;s a good investment and like I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out using the FAST shampoo and conditioner (which is really really amazing) this product comes jn handy being heat free!  If you would like to know more about the fast shampoo and conditioner feel free to see my review!  :D</li>
    <li> I really like these! They are cheap and good for your hair because there is no heat involved! :) Just put them in and let it dry and instant curls! I&#x27;m glad I got these.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, good size and soft. They hold curl and I will probably buy more. Should have more in a pack.</li>
    <li> These create beautiful curls that hold for days for me personally. I spay them with curling spray but other than that it&#x27;s all the curlers work. ;)</li>
    <li> I have a lot of long medium weight hair (middle-eastern) that tends to get frizzy and poofy.  Curling irons work great, but I have to go through quite a bit with rollers and blow drying with round brushes to get a perfect Kim Kardashian like coif that is heat-resistant.  Anyway, I was hoping these rollers might be a great replacement for curling irons and more travel friendly than standard rollers.  Unfortunately, these rollers left limp curls that were jagged and awkward.  I think you need a very low maintenance type of hair to get good results from these rollers.  They were very easy to put on and felt better than standard rollers, but the results were terrible and unnatural-looking.</li>
    <li> While these provide the curls, they are not very comfortable to sleep in. I may need to try putting them on the top of my head for better sleep!</li>
    <li> See previous reviews on other sizes! Very comfortable, variety of curl sizes, very fun. Diverbro</li>
    <li> Love these rollers they really work and they don&#x27;t pull out your hair</li>
    <li> Worked great!  So much better than my hot iron.</li>
    <li> If you move around in your sleep, this isn&#x27;t for you. As tight or snug I could wrap my hair around this and even wear a head scarf, these suckers just slipped right off. I used to have long hair below my elbows and it didn&#x27;t work out then because I didn&#x27;t have enough. Even after I cut my hair just below my shoulders, still didn&#x27;t have enough. Unless you mousse and hair spray your hair to make it less slippery, maybe it&#x27;ll work. But no hair products for me overnight.</li>
    <li> These spiral curlers are not the best rollers on the market.</li>
    <li> These look WAY smaller then they do in the picture. On top of that the are a different color and look way slimmer. no where on this package does it say medium</li>
    <li> This product is great. I suggest letting your hair air dry a little bit before you use the product.  Great for someone who wants to wake up with their hair already styled.  All I do in the morning is take it out and run my fingers through my hair with some hair product like anti-frizz and that&#x27;s it.  Saves me at least 10 min in the morning.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for EXTREMELY tight banana curls, you should get this. I have very long hair (about 18 inches) and they sprung up JUST past my shoulders. Im not too into that look, i prefer more loose curls/waves. I was disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> great rods they curl perfect and definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Chinese and my hair is quite thin and naturally straight. It&#x27;s slightly longer than shoulder-length and layered at the moment and I put the rollers in (I only needed 1 pack of 10; I used 5 on each side of my head after parting my hair into 2 sections) after my hair was 80% dry from the shower. I didn&#x27;t put any hair products in and I just left the rollers in for about 2 hours until my hair was completely dry. When I took them out, I got soft, pretty waves! They gave my hair more volume and didn&#x27;t shorten my hair length at all! i found them really easy to use and quite comfortable to lie down on. I haven&#x27;t tried using them overnight yet but I probably won&#x27;t because I prefer loose waves to tighter ringlets.</li>
    <li> These seem to work well but my curls don&#x27;t stay unless I hairspray (my hair is thick and coarse.)  THey are soft enough to sleep in.</li>
    <li> Too bad, they don&#x27;t stay in my hair.  They make great cat toys though tied to a string~</li>
    <li> My 15 yr old informed me that many girls are using this in their tutorials on youtube and she just had to have some. I decided to put these in her stocking. She has used them 3 times now. They are easy to use and she says they are comfortable enough to sleep in. The results are a nice cascade of &amp;#34;taylor swift&amp;#34; curls.</li>
    <li> Note these are about 1/2 inch wide for small spiral curls even though they say medium</li>
    <li> Practice makes perfect, it takes a minute to roll your hair so it spirals.  Thank goodness for u tube.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really straight and thinning.  Using a bit of foam hair product helps hold the curl.</li>
    <li> Rollers would not stay in my hair. No use for these.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my hair and very comfortable to sleep in. They work really well when I&#x27;m creating a pin-up look or just adding a little bounce to my hair. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought these after seeing a youtube video with a girl claiming these give you taylor swift hair.  i figured it was a cheap investment to try out. now, i don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way she was using this product.  i have thick, normally wavy, long hair.  i used these last night - one package was about right.  first of all, it&#x27;s impossible to get comfortable sleeping in them - i woke up several times a night.  then, when i woke up this morning (11 hours later - put them in a couple hours before bed), a lot of the hair was still not dry.  i took out the curlers and my hair was in TIGHT KINKY CURLS.  i pulled my hair into a ponytail and have finger waves.  it looks totally unnatural. also came out totally frizzy as i tried to pull my fingers through to loosen up the curls. my hair is about half the length as normal.  there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product, came as expected - but might be more appropriate for halloween curls than glam curls.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product does not produce the curls it advertises.  It was a bad purchase on our end.  Don&#x27;t get sucked in.  Keep your money.</li>
    <li> I ordered these amazing rollers before they became an add-on item. I recently wanted to order a second pack because I have waist length hair and needed a few more curlers in the back to get the desired tightness of the spirals. They are super flexible and fairly comfortable to sleep in. I put a satin cap over them and you can adjust the curlers to a position that is best for how you sleep. I was SO impressed with how well they curled my hair. I&#x27;ve NEVER been able to have tight curls because of the length of my hair. Not only can I wrap the entire length of my hair around these curlers, but I can also hook the ends so that the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out. I&#x27;m in love. My only complaint is that they are now and add-on product. All I wanted was another pack! If you need to get $25 worth of stuff, I suggest getting these. I&#x27;ve just ordered the Diane Twist-Flex Rods because I only needed the one product and will see how they compare. Amazon, please do better with your purchasing options! I love my Prime, but this is ridiculous!</li>
    <li> They are easy to use and I have long hair. I curl my hair dry with just a little mousse and the results are great curls just like I wanted...</li>
    <li> These are a pain in the butt to use. I can&#x27;t keep the bent right, my hair won&#x27;t stay on them... I used them a couple times and just get frustrated. If you have long hair, they&#x27;d worked better.. Medium/short hair women.. Stay away &amp; find a better option.</li>
    <li> They make the most beautiful curls.  They don&#x27;t stay in as well with thinner hair but overall I really liked them.</li>
    <li> Conair 62502z Medium Spiral Rollers are working well for the 4 individuals with long hair for whom I purchased them. They are very pleased with the results and use them regularly. A bit of experimenting is required to learn how best to use them. Sleeping on the rollers can give a tighter curl if desired, although it may be uncomfortable to sensitive sleepers.</li>
    <li> I could not make these work.  The first one would fall out of my hair before I got the second one in.  I gave them to my daughter.</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl. At all. I put my damp hair in these rollers and then slept in them. I woke up in the morning with great Taylor Swift curls. They look more natural than if I curled my hair with an iron, use no heat, and last all day! I didn&#x27;t even have to put product in my hair. I combed them out that night and wore my hair wavy the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the curls that come out of these rollers are less than perfect. I&#x27;ve learned that you have to put your hair in them when it is damp. If it&#x27;s too wet, they won&#x27;t hold up. If it&#x27;s too dry, you&#x27;ll end up with some lame waves. There&#x27;s a definite sweet spot for these. Also, if you touch the curls too much they get frizzy, just like naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, edging on the frizzy (unless done right).  This product didn&#x27;t tame my hair well (even with product).  It probably would work great on someone with naturally straight, frizzless hair.  But didn&#x27;t&#x27; do my hair any favors, and it wasn&#x27;t comfortable to sleep on (like I hoped).</li>
    <li> Really not impressed with these curlers. They make your hair look like it belongs in a 90&#x27;s coming of age sitcom. That said, if that is the look you are going for, they do stay in your hair if you bend them the right way. They are easy to use, but the end result is not at all what I was looking for. I guess I will have to stick with my curling iron.</li>
    <li> Works great for my wife, she really loved it , i would really recommend this for any one looking for some curls :D</li>
    <li> I have been using these rollers for about 2 months now and i don&#x27;t think i will ever stop using them. It took a little while to figure out how to put them in so that my hair came out the way i wanted, but now that i know, it is so great! I was worried about getting them at first because my natural hair is very straight and i didn&#x27;t think they would work. But sure enough, putting them in at night when my hair is wet and taking them out in the morning makes my hair comes out curly, and it holds better than when i curl it with a curling iron! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since using these :) and the best part is, in the morning it takes 5 minutes to take them out and i&#x27;m good to go! also, they&#x27;re no heat so that&#x27;s a plus if you&#x27;re trying to grow your hair out like me. i would really recommend getting these if you like your hair curly, want a fast hair style every morning, and don&#x27;t use heat products on your hair. they work fabulously! :)</li>
    <li> These were just as good as the small spiral curlers. I left them in all night and it was curly when i woke up. it took about 2 hours for the curls to relax and they turned into soft waves by the night. I like them.</li>
    <li> it was a good product probably just not for me&lt;br /&gt;my hair curling real easy and and fast&lt;br /&gt;for me these spirals were too small&lt;br /&gt;15 mints with them on fresh half-dry hair and i was looking like african american (i have light straight hair)</li>
    <li> SOOOOOO much better than burning your hair and or skin with a stupid curling iron. No gimmicks, this works. Although if you want more spiral curls I suggest you buy two packs. I bought one because I just like a few waves in my hair. At first the curls will seem too tight and bouncy but not to worry just brush them out, dampen them, or just wait a while and they will tame down and look normal. I promise.</li>
    <li> These work like a charm and fast too!  Perfect for when you&#x27;re in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying these in a bigger size!</li>
    <li> Rollers are not what them seem and do not do as well as they say.. they fall out very easy and hard to work with.. will  not buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were cheaper than those offered at the beauty supply store.  I know why now - they&#x27;re a full inch shorter in length than the salon rods.  This makes a difference if you have long hair.  Having said this, I wish they were longer because the thickness was perfect - many of the salon rods are thicker, even in the \\&quot;small\\&quot; size.  I had to send these back.  I gave them a three star because despite not being long enough, they were a great width and also were soft like the salon rods.</li>
    <li> these worked nice on my hair and gave a nice spiral curl. I would by them again. I bought 2 packs and used most to do my whole head.</li>
    <li> beautiful curls in a healthy way... heatless.. what&#x27;s not to love. thank you amazon and others&#x27; reviews to help me decide to purchase these.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped it would...but to be honest it could be user error. I wound up using my curling iron more than I used these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review having used this product exactly once.  I recall using this type of roller as a child, and struggling to figure it out then.....  I had, on those grounds, rather hoped this would include son instruction sheet for various effects. Sadly, there is only a sentence or two on theback by way of instruction.  However, it wasn&#x27;t sorely needed (though would be nice!).  Someone recommended securing the rollers to each other to prevent flopping around (or flopping in face).  I also recommend this.  They seen reasonably good quality.  All bent easily and help position easily.  Were simple to use, confytosleep in sndleft me with LOTS of curl and body.  I have waist length fine wavy textures hair (and lots of it!) and I managed withjust one pack of these, however, I think it would be easier with TWO packs and intend to order another. These are 5/8\\&quot;in diameter, which is smaller than a small hot roller or standard curling iron. So, theseDO create CURL not \\&quot;body.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work!!!  The directions say that you can bend the ends to secure your hair but in reality they don&#x27;t stay in your hair at all.</li>
    <li> i know it says colors may vary, but i had no idea I would receive bright fluorescent martian green, even though they work well .</li>
    <li> These are too stiff to twirl around and bend and waaaay to heavy to hold hair when you do get hair wrapped around.  don&#x27;t like it at all for my hair or my daughters!  We both have COMPLETELY different hair types, length, thickness and didn&#x27;t work for either of us.</li>
    <li> I had a high expectation about this product because i watched a video on youtube in which a girl named the curls by this curler \\&quot;taylor swift curls\\&quot;. It looked so beautiful in the video that i was dying to get one myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it turned out that the girl in the video had skills and a layered haircut that suits this kind of curlers...&lt;br /&gt;My hair has no layer at all except my grown bangs that come down below my chin, and the curler makes my hair look very puffy and big. It took a while for me to set up a method specifically for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;The curlers DO WORK WELL.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t even have to leave them on overnight. i would just wear them a little over an hour and my curls would have great body, which is very very good.&lt;br /&gt;After i take the curlers out, i tame my hair with hair oil or leave-in conditioner to lessen the puffy-ness. It works great!&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t put on hair spray, gel, or any hair styling product because then the tight curls loosen, it looks very natural and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i would definitely recommend it because this is no-heat and healthier for your hair. It is easy to use as well. Wrap, wait, BOOM!!!</li>
    <li> These are really great for the managed curls.And very easy to use. Comfortable to use overnight as well , can keep it on while sleeping. i  love it.</li>
    <li> These are actually pink with blue tips (just like in the youtube video for Taylor Swift curls that sent me looking for them). They work really good if you do it on almost dry/dry hair. If you do it with wet hair you end up with a frizzy fro. They aren&#x27;t the most comfortable to sleep in but if you position them right then its fine. They are a great product for no heat curls and I would definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> WHERE HAS THIS BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE? My hair sooo naturally straight, its hard to curl. With this product, my hair curls so amazingly and it LASTS!!!! I even sleep with them in, after i get out of the shower and let my hair dry for a few minutes. Its honestly amazing! Totally recommend you guys, i ordered two packs because my hair is realllyyy long and thick!</li>
    <li> I could not get these to work in my daughter&#x27;s hair. All that time and effort, with no result. No fun.</li>
    <li> shipping was fast i loved the packaging flexi rods were so easy to learn how to use loved the fact that it does not hurt and your able to get the styles you want and not have an uncomfortable sleep at night</li>
    <li> This was honestly the best hair curler I have used. It takes awhile to figure out the amount of time you need to leave it in your hair, but once you do it works very well. I have hair that can be curled quite easily so I simply just put it in to dry hair overnight and get great waves/curls in the morning. However i recommend putting it in when your hair&#x27;s wet if you have hard to curl hair. As the day goes on, the curls get looser and prettier in my opinion. You might want to put in hairspray though if your hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls. Overall, great product :)</li>
    <li> It does the job, kind off. Don&#x27;t expect your curls to come out looking like you just stepped out of the salon. I think a hit curling iron makes your curls look better as you won&#x27;t have to worry about the tip of your hair. This product does not curl the tip of your hair. You will get waves but the tip of the hair comes out straight. For best result, roll it while your hair is damp after shower..</li>
    <li> These are very small rollers! Not &amp;#34;medium-sized&amp;#34; at all!</li>
    <li> Came in magenta color. Great!</li>
    <li> These work really well. SO much easier than taking a curling iron to the hair. They are actually pink with blue tips so don&#x27;t let the picture confuse you.</li>
    <li> its very hard to use based on the instruction on the item. not very helpful at all. my curls did not turn out good at all. i tried both the small and medium sizes and still not any good results. the curls were crooked no matter how many ways ive tried. also, after bending these, it stays bent and wont fit the package again. disappointing.</li>
    <li> Im excited to try them and they look very easy. Cant wait to see the results I know that its going to look amazing! Ive heard so much about this product.</li>
    <li> These flexi rods work great! My daughter uses them more than I do. I will definitely order more of these in th near future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every which way to curl my hair with these and just want to throw them out the window. When I wind up the hair around the curlers, the ends unravel. I can&#x27;t get the ends to stay on the curler, even with a coat of hairspray and mousse in my hair. This does not give me waves or curls.  My hair type is thick and course and just past my shoulders.</li>
    <li> These make wonderful spiral  curls</li>
    <li> These did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> These ended up being better than I thought.  I used them over night, with no problem.  Just make sure to read the directions.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and difficult to use. Gives hair unappealing crinkles rather than attractive curls. Poor product. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong one they are medium and I received a small disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> It has nothing to do with the quality it is more about the length of it well not especially this but the problem I have with all twisty sticks is that it doesn&#x27;t allow much hair to be wrapped around the stick length-wise not width. I mean when you wrap your hair you can only wrap it so far especially if your hair is short like mine. It has something to do with the contour of the head, no body head is flat and square but it is just a problem I have with twisty sticks. Another thing is that I should&#x27;ve ordered two packs of the small instead of this one because my hair is cut short it is very hard to get and stay around the rod. But that is just my personal experience. There is nothing wrong with it manufacturer wise, it is conair so it is a good brand. The head of the rods haven&#x27;t pop off as yet hopefully they won&#x27;t like other spiral rods and hopefully it won&#x27;t stick to my hair. They also bend pretty well only thing is once they have been bent they can&#x27;t be straightened out completely but they actually bend and can be twisted unlike certain other brands which claim that but the rods never do. So far I have used them a good amount of time and they are still going. But if your not used to sleeping in those hard rollers you would probably be not be able to sleep with your head full of these maybe if there was just a few, you would be able to sleep peacefully. But I&#x27;ve had a good experience with these and would recommend them. Just order two to three packs of probably different sizes especially if you have short hair but if you have long hair past your shoulders order the medium and up to save you the hassle of getting the smaller ones out. It took us over an hour and half to get the smaller ones out of my sister&#x27;s hair which reached her down the middle of her back.&lt;br /&gt;But order different sizes trust me on this, your hair is not the same length all over your head especially if they are trimmed.</li>
    <li> I am not sure whether this product just requires you to have extremely long hair, but with my medium length hair, I could not for the life of me get these rollers to stay in my hair. They are quite heavy and hard also, so are not comfortable enough to sleep in.</li>
    <li> Spiral rollers are easy to use and work great. I am using them tonight. Easy and quick to get great results. I would buy these again if I needed to. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get them to work correctly or stay in my hair, i eventually gave up.</li>
    <li> These things are awesome for heatless curling!! They hurt to sleep in though.</li>
    <li> These were very questionable to me, but after trying them once I am in LOVE! So easy don&#x27;t even need to sleep in them just a little hairspray wrap leave in for an hour or so and amazing curls!</li>
    <li> These curlers curl my hair so well! The curls are so cute, although, the curls turn out a little different each time, but its fine. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the curlers dont stay in place, so I have to use binders to tie them down over night. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, very thick hair and this one package was all that I needed. I also used them on my 9yr daughter with the same length hair and twisted the hair before I wrapped it around the rollers and she was Shirley Temple in the morning... so cute!</li>
    <li> I loved these. They work great when you just wear them with wet or damp hair overnight. At first they are a little bit awkward too sleep on but you quickly get used to it. The curls are really pretty and stay for the whole day depending on if you put in hairspray after or not. You can also adjust the amount of curl you have by winding your hair around them in different techniques. I would deffinetely recommend this product. Their quick, fun, and easy!</li>
    <li> My Daughter states that the rollers are easy to use and meet her expectations. The outcome is what she was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Good product, curls my hair even in 2-3 hours.</li>
    <li> Returned because it wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair even after using mousse or gel.  Rollers fell off my head.</li>
    <li> I have thicker and longer hair and I do have natural curl. I bought 2 packs. I can sleep with these but with anything attached to your head it is not the most comfortable. After I put these in, I wrap a towel tightly around them when I sleep to help cushion and keep them in place. I took them out the next morning and my hair was so curly I could not brush my hair. The curls were so tight. I did not have to use hair spray. I wore it like that all day and everyone commented they liked it. The next day I was able to brush it but the curls were still somewhat tight. The hot rollers did not work as good as these. I love them</li>
    <li> I really like these rollers. I use them almost every single day now. They are so easy to put in and the curls turn out great. I definitely recommend these rollers.</li>
    <li> I used sponge-curlers for years, and these are so much better!  Sponge curlers took so long, I only did them about once per month, as a special treat.  But putting them in, and taking them out was VERY time-consuming.  With the rods, putting them in takes only a fraction of the time, and I have greater control over the type of curl I am making.  I can put in the entire 10-pack for tighter curls, or use as few as 5 for looser waves with body.  They are still a little tricky to sleep in, but that is probably the case for all curlers.  Overall great product, and definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Before buying these curlers, I would scrunch my hair with mousse and spray it with curl gel in order to get the waves I desired. Unfortunately, this led to product buildup in my hair and made it feel gross. Furthermore, people would ask me if my hair was greasy, which was embarrassing. That is why I am so glad I discovered these curlers! they are SO easy to use and that is saying a lot because I have extremely thick hair. They take almost no time to put in and can be worn over night! They are not the most comfortable things in the world to sleep in, but once I fell asleep it was no big deal. Probably the best thing about these curlers is the fact that they require NO heat which is great because that means they do not damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Tips for use:&lt;br /&gt;Put them in when your hair is DAMP and NOT wet&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you brush the tangles out of your hair before putting the curlers in&lt;br /&gt;Split your hair in half before putting them in to make it easier to get the back sections of your hair&lt;br /&gt;if you want smaller curls you may want to consider buying two packs because this pack only comes with ten. However, one pack works just fine if you want bigger more voluminous curls.&lt;br /&gt;Put the curler behind the strand of hair you want to curl and wrap your hair around the curler AWAY from your face&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you fold the ends in and squeeze them so they don&#x27;t fall out overnight&lt;br /&gt;Use hairspray after taking them out so your curls don&#x27;t fall out during the day&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend these to anyone who wants gorgeous curls without using an iron!</li>
    <li> Love these things! I use them with somewhat damp hair, and a little mousse. After 4-5 hours I have some nice curls! And I don&#x27;t have to pay for an expensive perm that just fades within a matter of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last perm was five years ago. It was over curly and didn&#x27;t last long. But, I&#x27;ve been wanting to get another perm for the past two years because my hair is fickle. It is straight at the top, and wavy at the bottom... and it simply doesn&#x27;t hold a nice curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so I thought...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was looking online for ways that I could give my hair a nice, light spiral curl (or wave), I ran across a video tutorial by a teenager named, Meredith. After I watched the video, I wondered if the curlers would do the same thing with my hair. Then I chuckled because I was getting hair styling advice from a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, if it worked I was game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next day, I went out to five different stores to try to find the Conair Spiral Rollers, and would you believe nobody carried them? Not even the Sally Beauty Supply store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After not having any luck purchasing locally, I went online and ordered them from Amazon. You get 10 medium rollers for just $8, so I ordered 4 packages. (The photo on Amazon shows blue rollers, but what you really get are pink rollers with blue tips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went out and picked up a bottle of TRESemme Extra Hold Curl Enhancing Mousse and a small bottle of Moroccan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the curlers arrived, I decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair and towel dried it. Then I added a light coat of Moroccan Oil, and left my hair to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it was slightly damp, I applied the Curl Enhancing Mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I combed my hair and rolled strands of my hair with the Conair Spiral Rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left my rollers in for about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I took them out, I had beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I put a gentle brush through the curls... just to see how they&#x27;d hold up. Then I pulled a section back and pinned it back, allowing the bottom half of the hair to flow freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls lasted all day. Even when I took the pin out of my hair and allowed all my hair to flow freely, the curls remained. It was so cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for nice curls without the harsh chemicals or high price of a perm, give the Conair Spiral Rollers a try.see how they&#x27;d hold up.

    <li> These are the best curlers yet, all my friends lot my hair when i use these and they all always ask me were i get them and i say amazon :)</li>
    <li> Works really good but when you try to sleep with them on at night it can be some what uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> I just got these today and put them in quickly expecting blah curls because of the haste. After wearing them for about 2 hours I took them out, super easily, and got awesome waves! The waves are really pretty and I can run my fingers through them! These are super easy to put in and pretty comfortable. I have really thick, long hair, that is really hard to curl/wave! LOVE THEM!!!</li>
    <li> Those conair hair curlers are fantastic. It curls my hair perfectly without heat. I just put them before i go to sleep and it does the trick. I really love it.</li>
    <li> I use thes rods to curl my hair,and the curl really stays in and throughout the day. hair is shiny and curls look smooth..</li>
    <li> love them there flexy as can be and sturdy definitely worth every penny. I can wait to style my hair with them tonight!</li>
    <li> I love these! I roll my hair up every other day so that I can get out the door quick and head to school. I found these rollers from a link on Pinterest that told me I could get Taylor Swift like curls if I just watched her YouTube video (see Stilababe). I tried using them with damp hair and my hair was still wet 6-8 hours later and the curls and waves would immediately fall out. So I tried again, this time rolling up my hair when it was mostly dry and the curls turned out great. If you want tighter curls, use more rollers. If you want waves instead, use maybe one or two rollers each side. I&#x27;ve had them over a year and only one of the foam rollers has broken. I don&#x27;t even need all the rollers for my hair so that&#x27;s fine. I bought some as a gift for a friend too and she loves them. Truthfully, they are not the nicest to sleep on. You have to figure out a way to roll your hair up that will be the most comfortable for you to sleep on. It takes a few tries, but I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t even work</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with the quality or anything, but I don&#x27;t like the results. I started using this head wrap thing by SoCal Curls and I like those results much better and it&#x27;s faster and easier.</li>
    <li> I put these in about an hour before work when I can&#x27;t be bothered with the straightners in the morning. They do tend to simply create a nice bit of wave, you&#x27;d need to have them in for quite a while to see a remarkable difference - and the curls will drop quite quickly (in my experience). I still love them, they make hair easy.</li>
    <li> Nice curlers to wear at night</li>
    <li> Bough the smaller ones and these both work awesome! Only complaint on these is i had to buy two packs because one does not have enough rollers.</li>
    <li> Work well!  I was a little mystified originally as to how they&#x27;re supposed to stay in your hair -- there aren&#x27;t really any directions besides &amp;#34;bend the rollers up at the ends to secure&amp;#34; or something to that effect.  I recommend positioning the roller vertically in front of or behind the section of hair you want to secure, and using a hair tie to secure it at the very bottom of your hair.  Than roll your hair up on the roller, holding it at a sort of diagonal angle as you roll.  Once you&#x27;ve rolled as far/tight as you like, you can secure it by bending the top of the roller in.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine, but the curls I got out of them were just meh. I don&#x27;t know if I wasn&#x27;t using them correctly but I got more frizz than curl.</li>
    <li> This is the good stuff. A Lil difficult to maneuver initially, but then it became a breeze. It makes lovely loose curls. Go out n get it. Save yourself from hot curling</li>
    <li> To be honest, I let they sit for about a month, because I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly  how to use them. But I tried them out for the first time yesterday night, 3-23-2013. I love them. I still have to learn how to place them, so that I can get the perfect style. but I would recommend them to anyone that is feeling artistic.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t seem to be quite as easy to use as I expected and I&#x27;m not really sure about sleeping on them, but I still think they are a great product!</li>
    <li> They were great! Shipped right on time.</li>
    <li> returned it, won&#x27;t hold hair, falls off</li>
    <li> These leave beautiful curls in my hair. I can get a beach wave or a spiral curl depending on how I roll them. However, the hard plastic ends dig into my scalp making it hard to sleep. I try to place the rollers on top of my head and down low but I generally end up with a less then comfy night of sleep.</li>
    <li> I bought these after watching a youtube tutorial on how to make taylor swifts hair with no heat.  These are amazing.  I have thick naturally curly hair that hangs to about my arm pits.  I use one package of these and it does my whole head.  It takes me literally less than 5 minutes to wrap them then I just go to bed and wake up with fantastic hair.  Love love love these!</li>
    <li> These are just what I was looking for!  I have medium length naturally curly hair, but I wanted bigger, more bouncy curls and these did the trick!  Mine are lime green - which I love.</li>
    <li> For a product like this, my inclination is to just buy the cheapest brand.  I mean, how much difference could there be between brands? I had some benders I got from Sally Beauty and they seemed fine. But I read the reviews on these and some others and discovered people had different opinions about that.  The price wasn&#x27;t really different between the Conair and other brands, so I bought these and you know what?  There IS a difference. These bend and stay in position much better than my other benders. I can get a tighter roll-up with them. I like them so much, I want to ditch the other ones and just use these.  Definitely buying more.  Well done, Conair!</li>
    <li> curls were way tighter than i expected, and they did not look good on me.</li>
    <li> They work wonders on your hair.i love the look after curling my hair with these. Definitely recommend to buy these.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t stay in my fine hair by themselves; I have to anchor them with clips.  Those blessed with fuller tresses might be lucky enough for these rollers to stay in all by themselves.  But I really like the curl that I achieve with these rollers!  It looks natural!  I mist my hair with plain water and a little leave-in conditioner.  Then I roll my hair in sections around the rollers and let them set while I do my make-up and eat breakfast.  My husband says I look fetchingly like Medusa (who was, after all, known for her great beauty before that whole snakes-on-her-head thing)!  Make-up and breakfast usually take around 20-30 minutes which has been plenty of time for the rollers to transform my frizzy waves into lovely and bouncy curls!  And the curls last all day, unlike the ones I get from curling irons.  Less heat damage and better curls!  Yeah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;1.  These don&#x27;t stay in my fine hair by themselves; I have to anchor them with clips.  Those blessed with fuller tresses might be lucky enough for these rollers to stay in all by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The 10-pack of rollers just rolls up my entire head of fine hair.  So if you have thick or long hair, you will probably want at least two packs of rollers to ensure that you can wrap up every strand.</li>
    <li> Love these as well. Bought the small size also. These are my favorites as the curls are not as tight.</li>
    <li> These simply do not stay in my thin/fine hair.  I can imagine they would work really well for someone with thicker hair.  Good idea, but practicality (esp for sleeping in) is uncertain...</li>
    <li> These medium size rollers- I bought 2 packs of 10 each- work great on damp hair. My daughter has long, thick hair and slept comfortably on them. The curls are great, and the day after you have waves if you don&#x27;t wash it. We used hairspray to hold the curl.</li>
    <li> Have not completely used these curlers, but I did spend some time playing with them and testing them rolling my hair in different directions and ways to test spiral vs. waves. I find these have good construction and appear to be good quality and hopefully will last me a long time. Great shipper, will recommend, and will be back, thanks!</li>
    <li> Work as intended. I love how they really curl my hair well.</li>
    <li> Product was true to description and worked fine.</li>
