### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a perfect shampoo brush.</li>
      <li>none compared to the perfect design of this one.  </li>
      <li>The best thing about this style compared with others is that the handle clips on the nozzle fixture for storage.</li>
      <li>great for your scalp...wakes up your head!</li>
      <li>And it also feels really good!  </li>
      <li>This French-made plastic shampoo brush is beautifully designed.  </li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re great.  </li>
      <li>So happy I found them again.</li>
      <li>It feels great, however the bristles are so close</li>
      <li>The shampoo brush I thought I was ordering was unavailable so a substitue was sent - it isn&#x27;t as good as the one I had ordered</li>
      <li>The handle grip is a good design also.</li>
      <li>They are made from a good polymer cast.</li>
      <li>These are perfect replacements and being made in one piece make them even more durable than the original Goody product.  </li>
      <li>This one gets through the hair and forms to your head for an amazing massage.  </li>
      <li>Once I used it in my shower, it felt really good on my scalp and it helped me scrub my hair much better compared with using my hands.</li>
      <li>Found just the thing I was looking for and was pleased.</li>
      <li>and I guess better than nothing.</li>
      <li>but I hadn&#x27;t been able to find them.  </li>
      <li>(I love that company).</li>
      <li>Which brush is better is a matter of preference.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good brush.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t easy to find.</li>
      <li>This little brush is perfect in the shower when you&#x27;re washing your hair....</li>
      <li>When I opened the package, I was surprised to find a bright orange brush.</li>
      <li>They passed the info on for their distributor of these and sent a free one along as well.</li>
      <li>I could not find the original ones anywhere -- seems Goody no longer makes them.</li>
      <li>Like most  of these on the web shipping is very high.</li>
      <li>Perfect for super thick hair!  </li>
      <li>This looks like a 79 cent Goody shampoo brush, an item I&#x27;ve used for more than 20 years in the shower and could hardly live without.</li>
      <li>I have a shampoo brush and that looks kind of the same as the one that I had.</li>
      <li>The grip is just right and the plastic is just the right consistency.  </li>
      <li>Shipping is a bit pricey, but well worth it even if it were twice as much.  </li>
      <li>A bit stiffer/harder than the one made by goody, and a bit more likely to break in travel.</li>
      <li>The goody distributor will send as many as you want for ten bucks.</li>
      <li>I think the good Lord was trying to stretch this conservative a little bit !</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had several of these brushes in the past and this one is, by far, the best.</li>
      <li>Shampoo brushes are cheap enough that replacement is not going to strain the economy.    </li>
      <li>I really like the idea of this product.</li>
      <li>This is definitely an equal replacement, as soon as they&#x27;re available again, I plan to pick up a few more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the same brush that was used by those cute Okinawa barberettes back in the 70&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>This brush which is used to shampoo the scalp vigorously is an excellent combing brush especially for difficult hair types.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold in the hand, and the plastic \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; are just pointed enough to stimulate the scalp but not so sharp as to hurt.  </li>
      <li>But as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s indespensible as part of my grooming ritual.</li>
      <li>Says it&#x27;s made in France - wow,</li>
      <li>I  bought a few so they should last for a while. :)</li>
      <li>After I dried my hair and brushed it with my regular brush, I was really satisfied that my hair was not greasy and my scalp didn&#x27;t have any dandruff.</li>
      <li>The LeClair will last the longest, as it is a single molded piece, while the Denman is two pieces held together by two plastic snaps that will surely break in ordinary use.  </li>
      <li>Suprisingly, not a single bristle has come off yet.  </li>
      <li>Product is a little pricey, but it is exactly what I wanted (a replacement for the Goody shampoo brush).</li>

<li> Price is a little high.</li>
<li> As a previous reviewer stated, I too was looking to replace my old Goody brushes.  </li>
<li> If you have long hair, use a French-style barrette to pin your hair up and let the conditioner work as you shave, exfoliate,scrub, floss and brush.  </li>
<li> I tried the other types of scalp massage brushes and they just don&#x27;t work the same.  </li>
<li> I tried several other styles but</li>
<li> is because the package is in Japanese with a few English words on it.</li>
<li> The little plastic brushes looks too flimsy to last long, but I had to give it a try since I haven&#x27;t used a porduct like this before and never knew about it.</li>
<li> This model is just hard enough to massage my scalp really well but not too hard that it hurts.</li>
<li> They do still make them but are only sold in a few places.</li>
<li> I bought a package that had two over at a little Japanese store in Little Tokyo.</li>
<li> I purchased 4 of these after reading other reviews from owners of the Goody brush.</li>
<li> The LeClair&#x27;s bristles are slightly stiffer than the Denman&#x27;s bristles.      </li>
<li> Both handle well, although the Denman is slightly easier to hold.      </li>
<li> If you have trouble with scrubbing your hair without having it all greasy, I recommend shampoo brushes like the one that I have and probably this one on dislpay.</li>
<li> I kept leaving them in hotels, so just got a few to keep on hand.  </li>
<li> But if you are looking for a plastic that&#x27;s not to hard, and curved to match the head, this is it.</li>
<li> I used it really hard on my hair, which may seem like it would break by the time I was done with it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this type of shampoo brush for years since I have thick hair.  </li>
<li> I would have given it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to use without pulling on my hair.</li>
<li> Boy, was I wrong.  </li>
<li> Too bad they&#x27;re not still sold in stores.</li>
<li> But the cost is horrible.  </li>

    <li> This looks like a 79 cent Goody shampoo brush, an item I&#x27;ve used for more than 20 years in the shower and could hardly live without. At $3.50, this is about 4X what it should cost. The best thing about this style compared with others is that the handle clips on the nozzle fixture for storage. But the cost is horrible.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This detangles and distributes shampoo and conditioner. If you have long hair, use a French-style barrette to pin your hair up and let the conditioner work as you shave, exfoliate,scrub, floss and brush.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Goody only brings these out every couple of years or so and then when they sell out, it may be a year or so before you can find them again in WalMartha or wherever. But as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s indespensible as part of my grooming ritual.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this style of shampoo brush for years.  This French-made plastic shampoo brush is a first-rate product.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> I have been using this one for about a couple of years and it works just like my last one. Eventually the plastic on these gets brittle but it takes about 10 years or so. This model is just hard enough to massage my scalp really well but not too hard that it hurts. I hope they keep making them when I have to replace the one I have now.</li>
    <li> I purchased 4 of these after reading other reviews from owners of the Goody brush. This is definitely an equal replacement, as soon as they&#x27;re available again, I plan to pick up a few more.</li>
    <li> I alternate between the LeClair&amp;Bayot and the Denman shampoo brushes.      Both are well made.  The LeClair will last the longest, as it is a single molded piece, while the Denman is two pieces held together by two plastic snaps that will surely break in ordinary use.  Shampoo brushes are cheap enough that replacement is not going to strain the economy.    Both handle well, although the Denman is slightly easier to hold.      The LeClair&#x27;s bristles are slightly stiffer than the Denman&#x27;s bristles.      Which brush is better is a matter of preference.</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of this product. It feels great, however the bristles are so close together my hair gets tangled. I would have given it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to use without pulling on my hair.</li>
    <li> This little brush is perfect in the shower when you&#x27;re washing your hair....great for your scalp...wakes up your head!</li>
    <li> I had one of these brushes for over 15 years and recently lost it and have been devastated.  I tried the other types of scalp massage brushes and they just don&#x27;t work the same.  This one gets through the hair and forms to your head for an amazing massage.  So happy I found them again.</li>
    <li> Product is a little pricey, but it is exactly what I wanted (a replacement for the Goody shampoo brush). I purchased a lifetime supply so I won&#x27;t have to search for one again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this style shampoo brush for 5 years.  I tried several other styles but none compared to the perfect design of this one.  They used to be made by \\&quot;Goody\\&quot; but I hadn&#x27;t been able to find them.  I accidentally left my travel one in a hotel and thought it would be a cinch to replace it.  Boy, was I wrong.  The grip is just right and the plastic is just the right consistency.  I&#x27;ve used this type of shampoo brush for years since I have thick hair.  I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a perfect shampoo brush.</li>
    <li> This brush which is used to shampoo the scalp vigorously is an excellent combing brush especially for difficult hair types. The handle grip is a good design also.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t easy to find. Too bad they&#x27;re not still sold in stores. Head and shoulders, so to speak, above the rest. It&#x27;s the same brush that was used by those cute Okinawa barberettes back in the 70&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Could not find this item for quite a while in stores.  Finally, found here and they&#x27;re great.  My husband won&#x27;t use anything else.  I bought a dozen.</li>
    <li> Perfect for super thick hair!  And it also feels really good!  Shipping is a bit pricey, but well worth it even if it were twice as much.  Says it&#x27;s made in France - wow, something that&#x27;s not from China!</li>
    <li> This French-made plastic shampoo brush is beautifully designed.  It&#x27;s easy to hold in the hand, and the plastic \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; are just pointed enough to stimulate the scalp but not so sharp as to hurt.  A first-rate product.</li>
    <li> The shampoo brush I thought I was ordering was unavailable so a substitue was sent - it isn&#x27;t as good as the one I had ordered but it&#x27;s here and I guess better than nothing.</li>
    <li> Replacement for a similar Fuller brush that I inherited 15 years ago.  Handle appears to have been improved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these brushes in the past and this one is, by far, the best.</li>
    <li> Found just the thing I was looking for and was pleased. When I opened the package, I was surprised to find a bright orange brush. I think the good Lord was trying to stretch this conservative a little bit !</li>
    <li> Product is excelent. Price is a little high. They don&#x27;t offer to let you pick color. But if you are looking for a plastic that&#x27;s not to hard, and curved to match the head, this is it.</li>
    <li> I have a shampoo brush and that looks kind of the same as the one that I had. I bought a package that had two over at a little Japanese store in Little Tokyo. I don&#x27;t know the name of the compant is because the package is in Japanese with a few English words on it. The little plastic brushes looks too flimsy to last long, but I had to give it a try since I haven&#x27;t used a porduct like this before and never knew about it. I believed it would help me with scrubbing my hair and scalp.  Once I used it in my shower, it felt really good on my scalp and it helped me scrub my hair much better compared with using my hands. After I dried my hair and brushed it with my regular brush, I was really satisfied that my hair was not greasy and my scalp didn&#x27;t have any dandruff. I used it really hard on my hair, which may seem like it would break by the time I was done with it. Suprisingly, not a single bristle has come off yet.  If you have trouble with scrubbing your hair without having it all greasy, I recommend shampoo brushes like the one that I have and probably this one on dislpay.</li>
    <li> As a previous reviewer stated, I too was looking to replace my old Goody brushes.  I could not find the original ones anywhere -- seems Goody no longer makes them. These are perfect replacements and being made in one piece make them even more durable than the original Goody product.  They are made from a good polymer cast. I  bought a few so they should last for a while. :)</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good brush.  A bit stiffer/harder than the one made by goody, and a bit more likely to break in travel. I had the goody brushes for over 20 years then couldn&#x27;t find them anymore.   So I emailed to see if they still made it and to find out where to obtain one. They do still make them but are only sold in a few places. They passed the info on for their distributor of these and sent a free one along as well. (I love that company). The product number is 01629. Like most  of these on the web shipping is very high. The goody distributor will send as many as you want for ten bucks. I believe the per item cost is one seventy nine. I kept leaving them in hotels, so just got a few to keep on hand.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the item but feel that it is way overpriced and shipping is extremely expensive.  I wish I could have found it or one like it locally ....</li>
