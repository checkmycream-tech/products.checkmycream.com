    <li> As recommended by my optician.  These drops for CONTACTS (they are not regular eye drops), work the best with my throw away contact system.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost all other brands of RGP contact lens drops and nothing provides me more comfort than these. With RGPs in both eyes, i carry this with me all the time. Good deal on the pack of 5.</li>
    <li> I love to carry these with me wherever I go because they soothe my dry eyes.  They defintely give comfort when needed.</li>
    <li> Not only is this great for dry eyes, I also put a drop in my lens before it goes into my eye for an immediate&lt;br /&gt; and long lasting day of comfort.</li>
    <li> Great value for a product that&#x27;s not always on store shelves.</li>
    <li> Great product...Never causes a reaction....I have very sensitive eyes and these never give me a problem..I use them daily....</li>
    <li> These are the ONLY drops I can use with my contacts on. They were recommended by my doctor and have worked well since. Very little redness now. Try this before using something like Restasis (Rx, which I used many years ago).</li>
    <li> I was using Blink eye drops for contacts but they kept ruining my contact lenses, causing them to dry out and subsequently making my eyes burn &amp; blur. I switched over to Refresh and couldn&#x27;t be happier! My eyes stay hydrated and blur free all day with an application in the morning and late afternoon. They also don&#x27;t destroy my contact lenses like Blink did. I will be sticking to this brand from now on!</li>
    <li> Avoid my contacts because my eyes get dry and itchy easily.  This product works great.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered several bottles so I can keep home, car office, handbag.</li>
    <li> I use these drops every day when I am at work. It was been continuously windy at my work and my contacts have been uncharacteristically drying out on me. I purchased these drops to try and find some relief and these have delivered. Just one drop in each eye every 3-4 hours keeps my eyes feeling like I just put my contacts in. Good product that was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Does not really lubricate very well the contact lens that I am wearing.  Although it helps when it comes time to remove the lenses at the end of the work day.  I just put a drop on a finger - the finger that will touch the lens during removal (may be different for every person).  The lens will stick to the finger and I was able to remove the lens quickly.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was shopping for! Great price and fast shipping! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product for contact lens users. Definitely the best I have tried. Delivers comfortable moisture to dry eyes while protecting the lens.</li>
    <li> I have bee using these drops for several years now, like them better than other brands.  It&#x27;s cheaper on Amanzon, so why shop somewhere else?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used RGP contact lenses for more than 20 years.  Frequent re-wetting is always recommended, so I usually try any new drops I found in the market.  These are simply the best drops I&#x27;ve used over the last 3 years, and will keep using them indefinitely.  So, I found this 5-pack very convenient.</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner at a fair price</li>
    <li> Good eye drops for contacts.  Best price I have found</li>
