<li> This sample pack is too small to do more than a couple washes.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t have enough product to really determine effectiveness.</li>
<li> However the sample was too small for me to use long enough to see a real difference in hair thickness or texture.</li>
<li> , it has a medicine like smell but that doesnt bother me, it also doesnt take alot to do the job, its very expensive but its worth a try, it also has turmeric in it where i havent seen other products use it, so that makes it unique.</li>
<li> I would definitely buy other products from this seller.</li>
<li> I have very short hair, so a little went a long way.</li>
<li> But personaly I feel a few washes are not enough to judge any shampoo product.</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected!  </li>
<li> I thnink the sample was pretty expensive.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not worth looking styled my hair with a hay bale.</li>
<li> i only have one complaint about this product, the shampoo is a little watery</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
<li> After just a few days of use I noticed my hair thickening.</li>
<li> Not a great as I expected though.</li>
<li> Products way to small.</li>
<li> When Aveda gives out samples they give at least 2</li>
<li> However the amount was very small.</li>
<li> Not the small travel bottles!!</li>
<li> To expensive for that.</li>
<li> even a little!!!!!</li>
<li> Unfair to say I hate the item since it was never used.</li>
<li> so disappointed in the price and the size didnt even get to wash my hair but once</li>
<li> stupid me did not notice the shipping or realize the size of the tubes.</li>
<li> Did not like..very disappointed in the size!</li>
<li> expensive junk!!!!!!</li>

    <li> This is such a rip off! On the back of each bottle it says &amp;#34;not for sale&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
    <li> Products way to small.</li>
    <li> Wish I had more to get a better idea...This sample pack is too small to do more than a couple washes. Shipping was very fast though.</li>
    <li> Did not like..very disappointed in the size!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have enough product to really determine effectiveness.</li>
    <li> tiny size . product is good but so tiny</li>
    <li> Did not realize when it states &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; it&#x27;s the one time use sample pack. Not the small travel bottles!! It even states right on the packaging not for resale.. I should have fought having to pay for that</li>
    <li> I think it is very pricey and really didn&#x27;t make that much difference.  I thnink the sample was pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t order this.  You don&#x27;t get enough to find out if it you like it or help</li>
    <li> Really good that they have a small trial kit, if you want to just see how it is. But personaly I feel a few washes are not enough to judge any shampoo product.</li>
    <li> i only have one complaint about this product, the shampoo is a little watery but i like everything else about it, i love the tingle it leavers on my scalp, it has a medicine like smell but that doesnt bother me, it also doesnt take alot to do the job, its very expensive but its worth a try, it also has turmeric in it where i havent seen other products use it, so that makes it unique. i would definately recommend this to a friend who has scalp issues or thinning.</li>
    <li> Good product. However the amount was very small. Just enough for one application for short hair. Think this is deceiving and price is too high for the amount of product.</li>
    <li> bottles were so tiny.  I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth the money to see if I liked the product or not.  I returned them</li>
    <li> The items being sold as samples are actually free samples from aveda.  When Aveda gives out samples they give at least 2 so consumer can sample the product. These products being sold are beyond over priced and the content is not enough to be able to sample the product.  Beware it is a sample size!! Unfair to say I hate the item since it was never used.</li>
    <li> My hair is like straw after using it. I&#x27;m going to quit using it. It&#x27;s not worth looking styled my hair with a hay bale. To expensive for that.</li>
    <li> a HUGE rip off. 3 minuscule tubes, maybe one time use, with exorbitant postage added. stupid me did not notice the shipping or realize the size of the tubes. Im sending back.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I wanted to try a sample prior to buying the larger bottles because of the price. After just a few days of use I noticed my hair thickening. I have very short hair, so a little went a long way.</li>
    <li> The product was decent. Not a great as I expected though. Shipping and the sellers processing was great though. I would definitely buy other products from this seller. Just want completely thrilled with the aveda product itself.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell, and how my hair felt afterwards.  However the sample was too small for me to use long enough to see a real difference in hair thickness or texture.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected!  Cost way too much for what I purchased!!  The product is great, but was not an amount I would purchase for the price!!</li>
    <li> Terrific way to try this product. Seller was prompt with shipping and the item arrived exactly as described.</li>
    <li> love the smell and the effect I get... will buy again</li>
    <li> expensive junk!!!!!! doesn&#x27;t work....even a little!!!!! don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Great product just not for my hair type</li>
    <li> so disappointed in the price and the size didnt even get to wash my hair but once</li>
    <li> This is an AWESOME product but you can purchase it for $8 from the Aveda website.</li>
