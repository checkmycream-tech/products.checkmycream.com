<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am 40 years old, and have very sensitive skin, and this product is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> i like this product make my skin feel cool and fresh. it clean up my skin and feel smooth. recomended to all oily/acne skin :)</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for my breakouts...but this cleanser combined with the toner and lotion are the best I have ever tried!!!!!.... And I&#x27;ve tried it all.... It really works</li>
    <li> Loved the product. I have also used the ones directly from the doctor&#x27;s office, exactly similar product and results. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this face wash...its the only thing that has kept my skin under control since I have gotten off of Accutane</li>
    <li> If this line was truly meant for the acne prone, it would not include the alcohol, fragrance, menthol, or coloring. All of these are notoriously bad for acne prone skin. To make it even worse, 2/4 of these items are in the middle of the ingredients list, meaning they have more than just a \\&quot;smidge\\&quot; of each in the product. Obagi should know not to include these ingredients if they really gave a crap about anyone with acne.</li>
    <li> I have been using the daily care formula for the past two years and I am satisfied with the results. As long as I use the product according to schedule I don&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good cleanser compare to cream cleanser better then cream .</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very effective if you are prone to acne.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has been dealing with outbreaks of adult acne since her early 20&#x27;s.(She&#x27;s 28 now) After years of dissappointment from other so-called remedies she was introduced to Obagi by a friend who worked for dermatologists. This product has completely rejuvenated her complection and restored her self confidence. The results were like no other product she&#x27;s ever tried. Obagi is now part of her daily skin regimen and continues to control outbreaks. This truly is a great product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Obagi is definitely a great brand to use. For my skin, the CLENZIderm was a little too hard.     I have a medium tone with very oily, sensitive skin and large pores. My skin is actually the best it has ever looked by using Obagi. If your skin is sensitive, you might want to try just once a day. It was very painful for me. My skin would dry out really bad, especially around my mouth and nose. It hurt to smile and burned for a couple weeks. I had to keep my skin VERY moisturized since it hurt for me to laugh and talk.     Needless to say, I&#x27;m not going to use the CLENZIderm again. But what didn&#x27;t work well for me might very well work for you. I highly recommend Obagi, but it depends on which type that best fits the skin you have.</li>
    <li> I am almost 30 years old and my face starting breaking out just as bad as it did as a teenager before I went on Accutane. I was not wanting to go back on Accutane, and was SO GRATEFUL that this product was recommended to me by several sources. When my husband was in medical school, he did a rotation with a dermatologist who had LOTS of patients using parts of the Obagi system. My friend recommended the clenziderm kit for acne, and I can&#x27;t believe what a miracle it has been. Really, my breakouts completely stopped once I started the cleansing system. My family was in town visiting a few weeks ago, and when I saw them again last weekend, they couldn&#x27;t believe my face had cleared up! Seriously, I haven&#x27;t had a single zit since I started, and I am going on 3.5 weeks. I am so happy and thrilled about the results of the obagi clenziderm system!</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great product for people who have trouble with acne! I&#x27;m 34 and have acne issues all my life. Clenziderm products have helped tremendously with it!</li>
    <li> Really works but you need to use all three products together for best results.  I tried pro active and this is better!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year, but purchasing it from my dermatologist at over $30! It is a good product--cleans well, removing all makeup and has a cooling effect on the skin. Very refreshing and helps keep acne at bay.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and this cleanser is the best. I have used it now for more than a year. If you leave the foam on for a few minutes you can feel the coolness of the salicylic acid work on your skin. The other products in this line actually stopped working for me after a while. They were perfect at first but just lost their touch for some reason. But the cleanser has been great with other products prescribed by my dermatologist (aczone + tazorac).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luv it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from Murad to Dermalogica... this is the only cleanser that has kept my skin clear and feeling clean and fresh everytime. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it dries out my skin sometimes but with the proper moisturizer its a miracle product for those with acne. Great product, please keep it at the affordable price!!!</li>
    <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive - works VERY well!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this cleanser</li>
    <li> I have been using the obagi cleansing system for about 3 months now.  I dont use the 3 step system anymore, All i need is to clean my face with the daily care foaming cleanser and it does the job and the price is excellent and I will continue buying it.. Thanks for the speedy delivery!!</li>
    <li> used my brothers product from this same line and decided to order it for myself. I love it! it is exactly the same as the brands sold at the doctors office.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really big on giving reviews, but I must  Say this is the 1st time in my life I can honestly  Say my skin is completely clear. I cannot believe  How great this product works.  It leaves my skin  Squeaky clean. Not dry and flaky. I would more  Then 5 stars if I could .</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser ever. It keeps my face exfoliated but not peeling. My foundation looks so much better on smoother skin.</li>
    <li> First of all, this is not \\&quot;foaming\\&quot; in the sense that it&#x27;s foaming soap. I hate the texture of foaming soap, so I was delighted that Clenziderm is a thicker liquid that goes on as a liquid and simply foams up as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product in conjunction with the Obagi Therapeutic Lotion, so I cannot attribute my results entirely to one or the other. I&#x27;ve used them together: the cleanser twice a day and the lotion in the evening before bed time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for about 6 weeks, and at this point my face is completely clear. I&#x27;ve had adult acne for years, and I go through stages where I&#x27;m clear, broken out, clear, broken out. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything, from $5 products to $100 dollar products, and I never stick to anything because it either never works or works temporarily and stops. Below is a detailed review, beyond the \\&quot;it cleared my face up!\\&quot; People who have suffered from acne generally need more detail than that to be convinced that a product works. So here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I began using this wash (in conjunction with the lotion), my face was pretty broken out (for me this means 5-10 zits). A week later, my face was much smoother. I had two small zits that I could feel if I run my hands over my face - these may be zits that would&#x27;ve surfaced anyway and sat there for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks of use: My skin looked worse than it did before I began using the product. That wasn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, so I gave it more time...I think the product was encouraging my skin to purge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six weeks: Skin completely cleared up - even little zits I didn&#x27;t realize I had until the big ones dried up - GONE. My face is completely smooth to the touch. I do have post-acne pigmentation. Not sure if this product can help that though. That requires time and possibly a skin-bleaching product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to note that I like the clean smell of this wash. I like to have some scent, but no one wants amedicated scent - this is just...clean. It&#x27;s a blue-ish colored liquid - you only need a dime-sized amount, if that (I have a square-shaped face that may require more product than many people). It definitely makes my skin feel clean when I&#x27;m done. Note: I use a basic everything-free wash to remove my make-up. THEN I use the Obagi cleanser. It&#x27;s not that the cleanser won&#x27;t remove your make-up; a dermatologist taught me this trick a few years back. Use something cheap to remove your make-up....then follow up with your  more expensive cleanser and it will seep into your skin much better (and you can use a lot less of the product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal to combination or oily skin, you should have no issues using this twice a day. Some people have said it dried their skin - perhaps if you have dry skin to begin with, yes. I&#x27;ve noticed minor drying, but I&#x27;d rather deal with that than acne. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash. I massage it on to my face for about a minute and then I let it sit like a mask for several minutes. That allows some time for the skin to absorb the salicylic acid.</li>
    <li> I am over 50 years old and have had beautiful skin all my life until 10 years ago. Recently I was diagnosed with Rosasia and thought the redness on my face was from that. I had many micro derm abrasions at the doctor&#x27;s office believing it would help but it got worse.  I was afraid to use this product thinking it would dry my skin, it did not -After using your product the redness is 90% gone. I hypothesize the redness on my skin was caused by an untreated bacteria that this product addressed. I will continue to use this product daily.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years and its the best stuff there is. Its a little pricey but worth it. The benzoyl peroxide 5% cream works the best too. Get the set, then replenish with individuals as needed.</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t write reviews unless something really stinks, or something is really awesome.  This line is awesome.  I have struggled with acne for over 15 years (teenage acne, then adult acne) and have gone through so much money on creams and pills and treatments.  It&#x27;s frustrating, to say the least.  My dermatologist was constantly putting me on new pills, new topical treatments, etc.  It was awful. I didn&#x27;t want to be on pills all the time! I actually got this set (you really need the whole set to get this stuff to work!) from a place I went and got a facial and a peel from to try and clear things up.  The girl that did my facial used it and it worked for her, so I thought why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kicker is (she explained to me) that although things will start out a little rough (peeling and redness, but nothing really bad, especially compared to all the acne I was used to) but you have to STICK WITH IT and keep using all three steps and your face gets used to it.  I will say that after two days (yes, really, two days) I noticed less inflammation, less redness, and the spots on my face were healing quickly rather than hanging around.  It just kept getting better.  I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now and I am very happy with it.  Am I 100% clear?  No--I still get a zit or two depending on my cycle and my stress levels.  Am I 90% clear?  Yes, and that&#x27;s WAY better than where I started.  Now that things have been going well, when I hit a particularly peely spot and my face feels really  dry, I&#x27;ll skip the therapeutic benzoyl peroxide lotion every other night, just to give it a little rest, but I don&#x27;t skip any more than that, and I didn&#x27;t start skipping until two months in.  Also, my facialist recommended that I get the normal/dry lotion to use on TOP of the benzoyl peroxide lotion if things were getting really really dry, and I do that too.  If you&#x27;re considering this, you&#x27;ve most likely been through what I&#x27;ve been through with acne through the years.  Try it.  I&#x27;m 99% sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I will never be without it again.  Good luck!  And STICK WITH IT!!</li>
    <li> Best cleanser I have ever used! I have Sensative &amp; dry skin- this is by far the best product out there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was a teenager and now I am in my 30&#x27;s and still have cystic acne and battle with it daily.  I&#x27;ve used Proactiv and when I first started using it I did have great results.  That was 7 years ago and nowadays my face has been looking horrible as if the Proactiv is doing nothing.  I finally went to a highly recommended esthetician who informed me that hundreds of her clients have gotten used to Proactiv and it no longer works.  So she recommended I try Obagi.  I noticed a difference with the first use! It worked better than when I first used Proactiv 7 years ago.  And the smell of the product is nice.  The downside is the price.  I must have this product so I turned to Amazon to find a better price.  The price on Amazon for any Obagi product can&#x27;t be beat.  I highly recommend this product for those who have gotten used to Proactiv or tried other products and they have failed.  With this price you have nothing to lose.  I love Obagi.</li>
    <li> I love how clean and invigorating my skin feels after I use this cleanser</li>
    <li> I just love the smell, the clean finish, the price, everything about this product is above everything else out there. My skin looks tighter and brighter after just a week.</li>
    <li> If you are struggling with acne you have to buy this line-  I never run out! I went to school for esthetics and I recommend to all my friends</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful and well worth tring if you have acne.  i have tried many systems and this one by far is the \\&quot;Best\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Gentle yet effective. Removes makeup well...It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like most cleansers. The Pore Therapy will dry you out bad, so only apply to pimple.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for over two years and it really helps my oily skin to balance. It also helps dry out pimples. I aboslutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Obaji Clenziderm products are excellent for deep cystic acne. Very pleased! I will continue to purchase these products in the future.</li>
    <li> REALLY FAST SHIPPING, EXACTLY AS STATED, WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER. SMOOTH TRANSACTION, HAPPY CUSTOMER. BRAND NEW AS DESCRIBED.</li>
    <li> My #1 cleanser when my skin is breaking out&lt;br /&gt;Always re order this</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well.</li>
    <li> I got this one just for a try, and did not expect it to be great. Then I was surprised by the comfortableness left on my skin, which definitely ameliorated my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I love it really much and will keep using it until my breakouts are all gone--they are drying up and disappearing now. Look forward to moving onto next stage!&lt;br /&gt;Great for sensitive and oily skin, though needs some moisture cream after it since it is a little strong in cleaning.</li>
    <li> Love this product- I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year along with the acne line of toner and moisturizer and have seen a big difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This item is a \\&quot;Knock-off\\&quot; of the true product/brands. This seller been changing their store name. They were once know as \\&quot;BeautyShoppe\\&quot; They do this so they don&#x27;t get negative posts by angry customers! I caught you! You&#x27;ve been under my my investigation. They get this product from China and just place Obaji labels on the bottle. Obaji is manufactured and shipped MADE IN THE USA. That is why they sell this product so cheap! You can only get Medical Obaji products from Doctors or licensed estheticians because it is like a prescription. The retail price is around $38. You completely broke my whole face out!!! I have used Obaji from a licensed esthetician&#x27;s office and my face is completely clear. Don&#x27;t be fooled by this knock off. The true product won&#x27;t break your face out. You can&#x27;t buy this stuff online. They are not licensed esthetician&#x27;s so they cannot receive bulks of this item. Be warned this knock off is known to burn people&#x27;s face! I know this product and store has many positive reviews, but I&#x27;m telling you the truth. I&#x27;m here to help you!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Works great, feels good, and this bottle lasts forever!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY FROM PERFUME WORLDWIDE INC! This is a fake! Ive been using obagi for over 7 years and the genuine obagi is hreat stuff and works really good but this a knock off! The real obagi has a more purplish color, the smell is supposed to be kind of minty, and when you use it your skin feels a little minty tingle. This is watered down cheap shampoo. STAY AWAY! Unfortunately, as I&#x27;m lately discovering you cant buy anymore genuine high quality products on amazon anymore. All fakes.</li>
    <li> I Love this product. I was buying it from my dermatologist for a lot more. This is a great price!</li>
    <li> I have been using Clenziderm cleanser for a long time and I love it. It truly feels like you get everything off your face. I love the smell, the tingle, everything! One bottle lasts me about 6-8 weeks.</li>
    <li> Since i have known her - no issues whatsoever - so It works:)  Definately recommend if your on the fence for this product or another- jsut get this one for sure.</li>
    <li> Very effective cleanser; it manages to clean extremely well yet still be gentle on sensitive skin.  You can feel it working, but there is no irritation.  An excellent choice for anyone with mature combination skin that is highly sensitive.</li>
    <li> Love it! This stuff starts the deep cleaning process! I feel like my face is incredibly clean. I hope I will continue to see results as I am going through the yucky phase right now. Seller provided expiration dates on items! Can&#x27;t wait to order again!</li>
    <li> I have used Obaji products before and like them but this stuff made my face break out the worst it has been since high school. It didn&#x27;t get rid of my breakouts it just made it worse. As soon as I stopped using it for a few days, my face cleared up. No thanks Obaji.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now as recommended by my dermatologist. It works great in conjunction to my prescription acne medications; I use it with my Clarisonic - leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Obagi is a great line and provides great products. The clenziderm line is one of the very few products that work for me.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser, minty feel after wash and my face feels clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent tons of money and tried lots of other products.  This it the first and only one I&#x27;ve had success with.  I will never be without it again.</li>
    <li> I can rely on this face wash any time my face is breaking out. Best face wash hands down!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I really love it so far!&lt;br /&gt;My skin has always been combination with breakouts in the dreaded T zone. I&#x27;m 23 (female) and definitely tired of the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that my skin reacts quite well to cleaners with salicylic acid in them and so when I was searching for a new cleanser ad my old one (Aveeno Clear Complexion Cleansing Bar) was okay but just not cutting it anymore so I googled for best face cleaners with salicylic acid and this popped up! The reviews are consistently good so I decided to give it a shot and so far it&#x27;s a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a bit of a purge in my skin as soon as I started using it (a good sign of an effective cleanser) and had only a small amount. It cleared up quickly and I&#x27;ve been left with great looking skin for weeks now! I still get the occasional spot here and there but I will say that I&#x27;ve noticed that when I do (especially for those dreaded &#x27;under the skin&#x27; monsters) the spots are small and just...not so bad. I really feel like this product does a great job of preventing and controlling acne even when it does appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the product twice a day, day and night, and A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY! you really DON&#x27;T need to use a lot, I&#x27;m talking pea size for your whole face. Don&#x27;t waste it! It lathers quite well and goes all over. Because of the salicylic acid, you really don&#x27;t need to over do it. Just wet your face liberally and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn you that it might INITIALLY dry out your face a bit. Your skin should get used to it and, of course, the severity of the dryness will depend on your skin type. If you have dryer skin than most, I might suggest using it once a day or decreasing if the dryness persists. I would still give it a shot though as I (and others apparently!) think this is a real quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I only use this cleanser and do not use the other two steps in the system. It seems to work really well all on it&#x27;s own although, I can&#x27;t imagine using the other two steps would cause any harm :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: May, 10th&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that I&#x27;ve found the holy grail of acne cleansers for my skin! I&#x27;ve purchased a second bottle because I don&#x27;t want to be without when my first one is used up. My skin has never gone this long looking SO GOOD! I&#x27;ve been getting compliments and asked what it is that I use. I typically breakout during my time of the month, about a week or so before and I was prepared for this month but...nothing! I strongly believe that it is the percentage of salicylic acid in the product that works so well. I still use it twice a day, but if I ever skip one of the applications it doesn&#x27;t matter. My skin has also fully acclimated itself to the product and I guess it&#x27;s Ph balance has evened out because I don&#x27;t have to slather on lotion on my face anymore....sometimes non at all. It&#x27;s as if my natural oils have been balanced. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATR: September, 2012&lt;br /&gt;this stuff is still working for me! 6 months now!</li>
    <li> Love this product! For the most part it keeps my skin very clear and leaves my skin always feeling very fresh! I do have scarring on my face from acne before but other than that if I do have any zits they&#x27;re very tiny little white heads I very rarely get any big zits anymore that leave bruising. I can honestly say my skin has never felt cleaner! Not all of my acne is gone , it&#x27;s a work in progress, But I definitely think everyone should try obagi and find the best line that is suited for your skin.</li>
    <li> This does not feel like a genuine product</li>
    <li> First off, let me say I have been going to a dermatologist on a monthly basis for about a year now.  Trying this and that and never getting any real results. Recently, she even suggested Accutaine, and I did not want to go there, so I started doing my own research. I never had acne as a teenager or even a young adult.  But I seemed to hit 34 and my face revolted.  I had moderate/severe acne that wasn&#x27;t going anywhere fast but only getting worse and worse.  I tried ProActiv, MD Forte, Retin-A, doxycyclene oral tablets(once and up to twice a day), another oral that I can&#x27;t remember the name of, another topical, and countless lotions.  Nothing worked!  UNTIL...I found this stuff!  It&#x27;s a miracle worker.  Seriously.  I stopped using all my dermatological prescribed stuff and only used the facewash and Step 2 morning and night.  (step two with a q-tip and as a spot cleaner; not all over) The first week there was a dramatic difference. The second and third week (be prepared) there is severe drying and flaking, but this is removing all the dead/damaged skin cells from your face.  I used some neosporin on my face during this time for the really dry areas, and now...my face is back!  :) :) I have minimal/very few new blemishes.  Now all I have to deal with is the residual scarring left from my acne.  For all those out there who are struggling with adult acne...try this!  After the &#x27;flake phase&#x27; you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little drying but it definitely makes my skin look brighter and smoother, along with preventing breakouts. A must buy if you are having skin problems</li>
    <li> This product has changed my life- my skin is clear, smooth, and acne free. I don&#x27;t remember how long it took to see changes, but within a month or two. A year later, my skin is healthy and acne free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the bottle leaks when I travel with it, even when I wrap the cap with many layers of tape.</li>
    <li> Great face wash. It is tingly and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne since I was 17, I am now 24 and this is the only product that has worked.</li>
    <li> I first got this through my dad&#x27;s dermatologist.  I used it and ran out.  My face broke out and I ordered it off Amazon.  Once I started using it again in three days my face started clearing up.  It really does work for me. I swear by this stuff. :)</li>
    <li> Best/most effective face wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  I developed a mild-to-severe case of acne in my mid-twenties as a result of stress and birth control and tried multiple acne treatments, including Proactiv - which did not work at all.  I even began going to a spa for various facial treatments such as skin peels (2 treatments seemed to improve my complexion somewhat) and microdermabrasion (no difference whatsoever).  During my first visit to the spa, the aesthetician recommended Obagi Clenziderm for my acne, telling me that it goes beyond the skin&#x27;s first layer to clean.  I was skeptical but desperate, so I purchased the product.  It worked wonders!  I was a little worried about the cost, since such a relatively small bottle cost $35, but that bottle ended up lasting 6 months, using it twice a day!  A little truly goes a long way!    Since it worked so well, I later tried adding Step 2of the treatment  (the astringent) to my routine, but did not see a significant difference.</li>
    <li> Great product that makes your skin feel fresh and tingly . It helps keep your skin clean and tight feeling.</li>
    <li> Very good product been using it for years</li>
    <li> You will definitely feel that your skin is really clean once you used it. With its everyday use, you will notice that your skin is getting clearer from any impurities. This will never be out in my everyday routine</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
    <li> After reading \\&quot;The Acne Cure\\&quot;, I set out looking for a 2 percent salicyclic acid wash.  The reviews of the clenziderm cleanser were impressive so I ordered it.      Clenziderm has a very nice fragrance, but felt a bit slimy and I needed a faily large amount to effectively lather my whole face.  I liked how it rinsed off nicely and how clean my face felt, but the menthol really burned my eyes even after drying off.  I needed to wash twice to get all the dirty oil out of my pores, so I first washed with Dr Bronner&#x27;s castile soap (which I LOVE), then followed with the clenziderm, but the menthol was still overwhelming.     Afterwards, my face did feel calm, not irritated or itchy like it usually does, but I don&#x27;t think I can continuously tolerate the menthol burn.    The book says ANY 2 percent salicyclic acid wash will do.  I found phisoderm has one without menthol and without sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate or artificial coloring.  It is also MUCH cheaper.  It is also getting good reviews, so I will be ordering that next.</li>
    <li> My young adult son has tried a half dozen prescriptions for blemish control, including Proactiv, and this surpasses them all.  The cleanser does not dry his skin like the OTCs or prescriptions!</li>
    <li> Hello. The item I have received is faulty. The dispenser is leaking gel, does not work and half of the bottle was squeezed upon opening the package.</li>
    <li> Started having terrible breakouts with big lumps under my skin and I scoured the internet to find something good with salicylic acid and after reading many reviews of many bands decided to try this product.  So happy I did.  Started working in a week and my skin is looking great. I haven&#x27;t had the extreme dryness which some reviewers described.</li>
    <li> Keeps my face clear without over drying.  Would highly recommend and this is a great price. My husband and son are now using.</li>
    <li> This product helps greatly to keep acne under control.  My child has tried everything, including Accutane, and was still having breakouts.  This product helps to keep acne under control when used in a good skin care regime.</li>
    <li> I have used this face wash for over three  years and love it! I tried another face wash that broke me out, returned to this and my completely broken out face was cleared up in about a week.</li>
    <li> I asked if he would use another brand which was a bit cheaper and he said, &amp;#34;absolutely not!&amp;#34;  I said but it appears to have the same ingredients, and  his reply was &amp;#34;they must use other things to combine with it, because it doesn&#x27;t work the same, I tried them all&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> So I have been using this for over a year.  It keeps breakouts away and is gentle on your face.  It does leave it dry.  I follow it with the step 2.  I would say it works way better than proactiv but thats because I cannot use benzyl on my face.  If you have a bad break out, using it twice a day will clear it up in 2-3 days.  If you use it daily, it keeps your face pretty clear.  Highly recommended for adult blemishes!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products in the past for my acne and this has been the only thing that has effectively worked!! being in my late 20&#x27;s it is not very appealing to begin having acne and other products did not work. This is the first product that i began to see a change since the first week!! Finally something that works!!!</li>
    <li> This works well for all acne prone skin especially for adults give the face an even skin tone and texture.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price! Our local store sells it for way higher!</li>
    <li> This is my third reorder, it&#x27;s the only cleanser that keeps my skin in check since I&#x27;ve gotten off the birth control, I ordered the whole system and just refill the ones I&#x27;m out of as all products last a long time</li>
    <li> I have been using Clenziderm for over a year now and was very unhappy when my package arrived. It was not the product pictured. Clenziderm is a purple foaming face wash and what I received was pink. Very unhappy and won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Love love love Obagi products and the Clenziderm line really helps clear up my acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I use this product every night - I haven&#x27;t had a break out in 5 years and my teenaged daughter rarely gets any. If we stop using it we can tell right away. The salicylic acid acts as an exfoliant too, so our skin looks healthy and vibrant. We don&#x27;t use any other products because we don&#x27;t need too - makes skin care simple!</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE face wash! This was recommended to me by my esthetician years ago but I found it cheaper to purchase on Amazon (of course!) I have skin that it prone to breaking out if I don&#x27;t follow a careful regime. A little of this goes a long way and I find that it just helps me keep my skin clear. My esthetician told me that Obaji is able to make a smaller particle of cleanser, which is why it can clean out your pore instead of just cleaning over it? I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s why-- but this certainly works! I especially like to use it with the toner.</li>
    <li> I will never stop using Obagi. I&#x27;ve been using Obagi for 10 years now and love it so much.</li>
    <li> I used to have to go to my dermatogist to get this face wash. It gives you the warm tingly feeling</li>
    <li> Love this product highly recommend. Will always use Thai my face has never been better no break outs any more</li>
    <li> I have now used this product for one year and it cleans my skin well. This is better than any cleanser I have used. It  is a good cleanser, but it does not do the whole job. You still must use exfollient cream after. My acne is old people whiteheads over nose, cheeks and chin. It does not dry my skin. It is clear with a slight blue tinge.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It keeps my face healthy and acne free.  It is very strong so be sure to use a moisturizer in areas that you need. I love the Obagi Hydrate since it is time released.</li>
    <li> One of my staple cleansers, my skin shows when I quit using it.......</li>
    <li> Both my daughters use &amp; like!! They are 20 &amp; 23.</li>
    <li> This is THE best facial cleanse I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin went from kinda meh, the occasional breakout to flawless and glowing. Seriously. I didn&#x27;t think products like this existed for less than a ridiculous amount of money I&#x27;m not going to spend. I&#x27;m religious with this stuff and look forward to using it. I&#x27;ve also been using this tiny bottle for like 8 months, I&#x27;ll have to get more before the year us up but it was the best $30 I&#x27;ve ever spent on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal/slightly sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great face wash if you get a little breakout.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Have ordered it multiple times.</li>
    <li> Love this product alot!! This was recomended by my dermotologist and been using for about two years. Its usually on and off but cant be without it. This cleanser along with two of their other face care creams are perfect for acne skin. I recomend this product for oily skin too. I use it twice a day everyday if needed.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders, but you MUST stick with it! The first day I used it I was SO disappointed! My skin felt so tight and dry. I kept using it (just once a day now) and that dry tight feeling went away and my skin has improved dramatically. I do use a mild moisturizer now, especially around my eyes. Im 47 and have oily, acne prone skin. As soon as my acne is under control and the Clenziderm is gone, I will switch to the NuDerm line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the obagi clenziderm products on my skin for couple of years now and it has made a big difference. My pores are smaller, my face looks less greasy and I love the tingling sensation!</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for years, the product is wonderful, but the bottle leaked during shipping, and I lost about 2/3 of the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Same that we get at our dermatologist&#x27;s office but half the price!</li>
    <li> I give all the credit to this face wash for keeping my skin clear and healthy after years of breakouts.</li>
    <li> If you take anything away from this review it should be that this line (Clenziderm) is the ONLY skin care line that has cleared my acne. I am 32 years old and have had acne since puberty. I don&#x27;t have the absolute worst skin, but I can count on both hands the number of days in my adult life that my skin has been without at least one pimple. I have tried so many lines (including Proactive, Murad, DDF, Aveda including grocery store brands, etc and also used BenzaClin topical Rx) all of which either made my skin worse or did not have any effect. I was at a laser hair removal appt at a dr&#x27;s office and saw a poster for Clenziderm and was so impressed by the before/after pictures that I wrote down the name to see how much Amazon sold the products for ($$ at the doctor&#x27;s office). It was/is very affordable on Amazon so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be such a loss if it didn&#x27;t work. Right away I noticed a difference in my skin, I wanted to write a review right away but thought I would give it some time. Its been 8 months and I am still so happy. I still have occasional small breakouts, but nothing like I used to. I now have blemish-free skin most of the time, and when I do get a pimple, they clear much faster than before. FYI, I only use the cleanser and the Therapeutic Lotion (benzoyl peroxide cream) as I was not happy with the moisturizer (too greasy).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on for two years now. I love it! I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I use this product and the toner and as a result after about maybe 4 weeks the acne I had is finally under control.  I still get the occasional pimple, but not as much as I use to.</li>
    <li> My derm recommended this. I had and still have terrible acne. As an adult, it can be quite embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product does not 100% clear me, it has been the most effective that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my friends are taking notice. They love my clear skin!</li>
    <li> The is a miracle product, keeps my face clear and smooth like buttaaaaaaa</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this product for a couple of years and it does a good job keeping her acne to a minimum&lt;br /&gt;without over drying her skin.</li>
    <li> This is the face wash I use all the time.  Got it in 2 days and great price!  I would recommend this product to anyone with oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry.</li>
    <li> I love this product it has helped me with my adult acne.  I started pre menopause at 45,  when I noticed horrible &amp; painfull acne.  It helps with acne and antiaging at the same time.  Now that my acne has cleared up I use it once a day in the morning and use the the Obaji C cleaning Gel at night for more moisture.</li>
    <li> Obagi has always been a favorite prodcut of mine. It feels wonderful on your face and it is what i have used for several years great product!</li>
    <li> What else can you ask for?  Always works as advertised and the cost is reasonable.  I recommend this if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet!</li>
    <li> Clean as a whistle with a slight tingle is what you get from this product. When Spring arrives, I get busy in the yard and experience complexion breakouts. I can count on Clenziderm to clear up the problem in no time.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my granddaughter and she is pleased with it.She has been using it for a few years now</li>
    <li> Great product! Works well! BUT the packaging is terrible. The bottle leaks from the top. If you want to take it on a trip you have to put it in a ziplock bag. AND it STILL LEAKS!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has helped clear up my skin beautifully! I was having a problem with oil bumps (oil getting trapped under my skin to form a pimple without a head on it). This product in conjuction with the Clenizderm toner and theraputicIotion for normal to oily skin has worked wonders. will be ordering more soon. I&#x27;ve even got my 13 year old niece using it and she loves it too. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I Have been using this for the last few years wash at least 2 times a day and keeps my skin clear, and removes the dead cells as I am up in age and the turn over is slower. so I have a more youthful glow and clear clean skin like in my 20&#x27;s so I will continue to use this every day.</li>
    <li> I have had breakouts on and off my entire teenage and adult life.  I am 32 years old so you know how frustrating that can be, It has been so frustrating switching from product to product to try and find one that works.  My friend actually gave me this saying it helped her.  And she was right!!!  Within days my face was clear.  i Have not had any major breakouts since i started using it.  It is definatley worth giving a shot.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this facial cleanser system at the place I go to for laser hair removal. I HIGHLY recommend this system. I&#x27;ve always struggled with acne due to medical hormonal issues (PCOS) &amp; this system was a Godsend. When using it for the first time, it will burn like no other facial cleanser you&#x27;ve ever used. (I think step 3 is the worst, but we&#x27;re not talking about step 3 here) And yes, it is strong &amp; when going through the process of your skin peeling &amp; flaking initially, it is VERY uncomfortable, and unattractive, (imagine after a sunburn your skin is peeling &amp; you put foundation/makeup over it to cover it up kind of thing) but it certainly wasn&#x27;t any worse than looking at acne, and at least I knew that when it was done running its course, my skin was going to be radiant. It is way less expensive on Amazon then getting it locally, I just wish I could find step 3 on here too. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Acne dries up noticeably after just one use, and clears up almost completely after a few, at least for me. I don&#x27;t generally have bad acne, so it might be different for other people.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST cleanser. I have purchased this at least 3 times and I will continue to order it. It has a fresh minty feel after you wash your face and it does a great job cleaning the makeup off my face.</li>
    <li> I recieved the bottles in good condition.  They are sealed well and packaged appropriately. They had a expiration date more than a year away. I&#x27;ve been using this face soap for over a year. The price at the medical spa was over twice what I paid here. It&#x27;s the same product.</li>
    <li> I am a 35 year old woman that still suffers from occasional breakouts. I have been using Clenziderm Foaming Cleanser for about 6 months now and my skin has never looked better. I get compliments on how young I look all of the time. I have finally found the perfect product for me. Obagi for life!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to new customers...Obagi products tend to feel a little harsh when you first start using them. Hang in there though. This eventually goes away and your skin will never look better.</li>
    <li> leaves skin dry but it works to remove pimples. has a nice smell and a little goes a long way with this product</li>
    <li> I am not one to write reviews but I have wasted so much money on skin products just to use them 5 times and realize they are trash that I decided to review all the skin products I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently discovered Amazon &amp;#34;best sellers&amp;#34; and decided to see what acne skin products sell the most and have the best reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought five different skin cleansers. This Clenziderm was the second best. I usually dont spend so much on skin care but in actuality I do because I by something for $10 only to throw the product away and buy something else, so I thought I might as well start trying decent products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a mild acne sufferer. I get pimples anywhere on my face. Lately my cheeks chin and nose mostly. I am 24. When I was a teenager I had bad T-zone acne, the pimples have seemed to change location once I hit my 20&#x27;s. I also have nose blackheads and larger nose pores so they are super hard to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my experience with Clenziderm. I bought it after I had used up almost an entire bottle of NanoCleanse (also Amazon Best Seller, bought on Amazon and somewhat cheaper) I heard great reviews about Obagi and all of Obagi&#x27;s lines that I thought I would give it a try even though I thoroughly liked NanoCleanse. Clenziderm lathers really well and has a menthol smell to it and after you are finished washing your face is clean but feels like Vicks Vapor Rub is all over it... for about ten minutes. The bottle says do not apply anything after washing for about ten minutes so I assume whatever is happening in that time I am feeling the effects of it. I like things that make me feel like something is working! I used this product twice a day and I didn&#x27;t have any NEW pimples. It did not do anything for my blackheads. And the pimples I did have cleared up on their own. Now I gave this product 3 stars because it dried my face out to the point where even though my skin had no pimples it wasnt attractive skin because itwas dry (for the record I do not wear makeup except mascara). I used moisturizer but I still was not satisfied with the look of my skin compared to how it looked using NanoCleanse.  Personally, out of all 5 products I have bought for my daily cleanser I will be buying NanoCleanse and that is my winner. If you want to read my review for that feel free but I thought I would share my experiences. I wasnt crazy about this product like I thought I would be.</li>
    <li> My teenage son tried everything over the counter. This was by far the best. We first received it from a Skin Specialist then happily realized I could order from Amazon. When he uses regularly, it will clear his acne right up. We tried everything else..even Proactive with no good results.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It make&#x27;s my skin feel great and keeps the acne away. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> i swear its different than what i bought at doctors office dpesnt seem to be the same product i would like my money back</li>
    <li> works great and what a better deal!</li>
    <li> This other only acne cleanser that actually works! We have tried everything!! Use it with the other products recommended for best results.</li>
    <li> Ive been using Obagi for 4 years now and it works amazingly. This product is not advertized for some reason and it should be. It clears my face up within a week. Anyone who has acne problems should totally get this stuff. In stores its like $140 for all 3 steps so ive been buying it on amazon for $60 for the last couple years.</li>
    <li> I, like many others who review these types of products, have struggled with acne for over a decade. I&#x27;ve tried this, that, and the other, and nothing *really* worked. While expensive, the Clenziderm line is worth every penny (besides, a little bit really goes a long way). I&#x27;m going to review the whole line (cleanser, lotion, moisturizer), because I&#x27;m assuming anyone reading the reviews will be looking to purchase the whole system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take some time to figure out how to best work it into my routine, and this will be different for everyone. Like many others, using the Clenziderm line all the time dried my skin out (and I have super-oily skin), so I only use it once per day (in the morning). At night, I use my Clinique acne products, which are much less harsh. This pattern was especially important in the winter. I also noticed that using the foaming cleanser just like I&#x27;d used any other (massage in, immediately rinse off) really didn&#x27;t help my acne much more than other products. What I learned to do was apply it at the beginning of my shower and leave it on until the end before rinsing. This made all the difference (and didn&#x27;t work with other products). So between leaving the cleanser on for several minutes and only using it once per day, my skin seems to love the routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, many people complain that the series is uncomfortable. I will admit this is true particularly for the toner (lotion) and definitely the moisturizer. My skin is nearly as sensitive as it gets, but I just put up with it. If your skin is even more sensitive or it just hurts too much for you, I would try working with just the foaming cleanser. Sometimes the burning of the moisturizer even makes my eyes water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only honest complaint about the whole system is the packaging. I carried the lotion in the pocket of my cargo pants one time and, even though the lid was on securely, it leaked everywhere! A good $10-worth or so leaked straight into my pocket. I tightened the cap and, testing again, gently tipped it onto its side. It leaks so quickly that it&#x27;s visible. So never put/pack the lotion anywhere that it won&#x27;t always be upright. The salicylic acid smells wonderful, but it&#x27;s an awfully expensive perfume. The design for the moisturizer bottle is equally poor. I know it is claimed that the bottle is supposed to pump the product out, but it just doesn&#x27;t. I took a straw out of another product for it. Without it, the whole bottle is rendered useless. SEE EDIT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, the word of advice is that if you&#x27;re like many acne-prone folks who haven&#x27;t found anything that works, give this line a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;ve previously always purchased my Clenziderm products individually. I&#x27;ve just ordered them as a set for the first time, and directions were included in the package. You&#x27;re apparently supposed to push up on the bottom of the moisturizer bottle while pumping to get the lotion out. I never would have realized you could do that. Ingenious.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time, and it is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin! It feels so good that my skin can now breathe.</li>
    <li> No more breakouts!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 54 with combination skin that has never been acne prone, but we moved to TX from AZ and in the humid TX climate I was breaking out A LOT. Nothing was helping, not even strong astringent 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleared me up, left my skin tingly and the scent is so refreshing/vibrant, I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I was so tired to trying other products that claimed they would help get rid of my adult acne. Not to mention all the $$$ I spent on those products that didn&#x27;t work. As well as facials and peels. One of the esthetician I had gone to had mentioned Obagi products. At that time I didn&#x27;t invest in the brand because I thought I had to purchase it from her Spa.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 2 years and I just thought about looking on Amazon for the products, to my delight Amazon had a large variety of Obagi products...so I immediately ordered the Clenziderm M.D. Daily Foam Clenser. I was so excited to get it and start using it. To make a long story longer this Product has made me LOVE My SKIN!!! I will never waste money on any other Brand again. My acne is GONE, my skin is smooth, I can get away with wearing less makeup because I don&#x27;t have to cover zits and blemishes anymore. So So So Happy with this product. It&#x27;s not expensive compared to what I have spent before on other worthless products.</li>
    <li> simply put....it works! no more wasting money on other products.  Used together with the acne lotion from the Obagi acne line for 6 months now only use the soap....no acne after total of 8 months.  Don&#x27;t like writing reviews but just couldn&#x27;t pass on this one.  I had acne since 14 and I have done EVERYTHING under the sun. I know how much I sufferd for so many years and I felt I needed to share.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and use it every morning.  Can also leave in for a few minutes for a mini &amp;#34;chemical peel&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have had problem skin since my teens (now in my 40&#x27;s)and have tried everything from accutane to tetracycline, including Proactiv.  This product made an immediate difference in my skin.  I have oily skin with large pores and tend to breakout once a month thanks to hormones.  I received my Obagi right before my monthly breakout and within two days people were complimenting me about how great my skin looked.  No kidding.  It is very drying, in fact my fingertips were rough and dry from applying the product so make sure to wash your hands well. I can feel the difference it makes on my skin and love it!  Thanks for a great product that actually works.</li>
    <li> First thing that actually worked for my adult breakouts and keeps my oily skin under control</li>
    <li> Price of Obagi Cleanser was very reasonable and product arrived promptly.  Would definitely use this seller again.  The Obagi Clenziderm M.D. Daily Foaming Cleanser is great for those who love Obagi, but have &amp;#34;break-outs&amp;#34; from the Obagi NuDerm foaming cleanser.</li>
    <li> Better than proactive!!! Don&#x27;t let the price discourage you this little gem is amazing.  Best facial cleanser for anyone with an acne problem.</li>
    <li> Great product and cheaper than getting at the salon.</li>
    <li> This is the best night acne face wash&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for years - it&#x27;s worth the price and works so good...&lt;br /&gt;It has really helped my face</li>
    <li> I would never use anything else after using Obagi! I sue the pore therapy as well and this stuff is like magic in clearing up my skin! I have used for over 1 year now and my skin has never looked better! I highly recommended using this with the entire line since they all work so well together!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years, and I really like it. It has greatly helped my breakouts. It leaves your skin feeling very clean. It&#x27;s a little more expensive than cleansers you would find in stores like Walmart, but it has been the best for my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the Obagi system! I started using it after I developed melasma after both my pregnancies and the blue line with the lightening cream really worked. Its a pain to do all the steps but its worth it. It takes about 3 months, but it really does work and made my skin even &amp; clear again. I use the acne line every night now to prevent breakouts due hormonal shifts, and it works perfectly. I just use the leave on solution when I feel a pimple coming and it stops it before it has time to get worse. Otherwise, I just use this cleanser and a really good moisturizer every night. This product line is definitely the real deal and in my opinion worth the money!</li>
    <li> Product is great just apply day and night and you will have clear skin. Hehe. Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes though, it burns</li>
    <li> I had been getting a recurring staph infection on my face for 3 years and was prescribed antibiotic pills and creams but it kept coming back over and over!  I was desperate so I asked my botox doctor for help and he suggested using Obagi, I absolutely did not think it would work because it is for acne but it started clearing up immediately and has prevented new infections!! So happy I could cry!!  I guess it kills all problem causing bacteria!</li>
    <li> Great product my daughters face looks great! Make sure you are using step one and two together it gives you better results</li>
    <li> Love this product! Has helped my acne prone skin in addition to my regular skincare routine.</li>
    <li> That pretty much says it all! The only downside is that if you use it multiple times a day it will dry your skin out. I like using it at night to remove all the dirt and makeup from the day. In the morning I would really recommend using the Obagi step 1 daily care cream cleanser. It gets you squeaky clean without drying you out.</li>
    <li> WE love the this product. My daughter and I both use this wash.  We have experienced great results. We have been using it for two years now.  We have been able to get the products at a reasonable price on Amazon</li>
    <li> Swear by this stuff for acne.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months. Works well to clear up blemishes and acne. Works even better if you use with a clarisonic brush. Good results!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin super clean without the overdryness! Keeps my face clear and radiant would definitely recommend over the drugstore face washes with Salicylic Acid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clenziderm products for years and this is my favorite.  You only need about a dime amount, so it lasts a really long time.  The price for this product is exceptional, too!</li>
    <li> Cheaper option than buying it from my spa. Great facial cleanser along with the other two items to go with it. I would def buy this agian!</li>
    <li> I stopped using it after a few weeks. It seemed to be working the first 2 weeks I used it but after that  my  face started to break out again while using the product.  The product didn&#x27;t really work for me the way it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> My acne has cleared up after using this for a month!</li>
    <li> It got here finally, the post office had a snaffoo but the product is perfect. thank you</li>
    <li> This product may be pricey compared to the usual cleanser on the store shelves but it works great, smells fresh, and makes my skin feel wonderful. Using this as part of my skin treatment has really changed my face - think of the before and after pictures you&#x27;ve seen on tv! Now I&#x27;m not battling breakouts but one or two pimples, occasionally, and lightening the scarring. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 months now. Day and night the first month and only I noticed the change in my face, I switched to only using it at night since it is a little drying (I have oily skin, especially in the t-zone) The change was not overnight - like I said, it was noticeable after about a month and got better and better. For me, the first bottle lasted about 4.5 months - you only need a little to thoroughly clean your face.</li>
    <li> This is the only face wash that has consistently worked for me. I had pretty bad acne and I tried just about every wash. When I tried this, it started clearing me up right away. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin raw/dry, too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  The fumes bothered my eyes a bit, at first,  but overall there&#x27;s a comfortable tingling sensation when you put it on, and our skin felt so much cleaner, smoother, and pores were not as prominent on my nose.  I did not expect it to be that effective.  I am impressed, will continue to purchase, and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for a few years now along with the second step to this product line. It has worked pretty well on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for 22 years for this!!!! I have never had clear skin since the age of 10...I have spent so much money on ANYTHING I could get my hands on...and I am far from rich...I literally work overtime just to buy Obagi products...it is worth every penny...&#x3D;) My face took about 3 weeks to clear up and has glowed and been clear ever since....I cannot believe it...I look amazing!!! &#x3D;) lol  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Its the only facial cleanser I now use. It works very well for my acne-prone skin. Keeps things under control.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will never switch. a little goes quite a long way and it makes your skin feel refreshed after you wash it.</li>
    <li> This product suds up great and cleanses the face removing makeup and oil from the skin, really like the product</li>
    <li> I used Proactiv for five years and it moderately cleared up my face. If i was under stress I would still break out badly. I decided to try this cleanser and was amazed!!! after only two days I saw a major difference in my skin!!! it was clearing up and all the old blemishes were drying up and disappearing. with the proactiv I would scrub my face with the cleanser and then tone and the cotton balls would still be black but with this product I dont even need any of the other steps, just the cleanser is all I need. Just as a side note i have oily skin with enlarged pore but now my pores are shrinking thanks to this wonderful cleanser!!! i cant say enough great things about this product!!!</li>
    <li> The best face wash ever! Use it religiously! Help me keep my face acnefreeee! If like me you have horrible acne try this product! You will love it too</li>
    <li> Helps fight acne bacteria.  I&#x27;m 44 and use it once a day to help keep acne at bay.</li>
    <li> I love it! I love it! Obagi is my life saver. People should definitely try obagi...or you guys should just switch to it, instead of proactive or any kind of product you guys are using...because obagi really does works.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and I love this cleanser you can feel it working once you put it on.  Not a big fan of lotion but definitely love cleanser and toner.</li>
    <li> very refreshing  love using this product I use it everyday and I have very sensitive skin . So i would reccomend it</li>
    <li> great price saved a generous amount of money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, but because of budget cuts, couldn&#x27;t afford to buy it again.  My skin has missed it so much!  My dermatologist didn&#x27;t sell the clenziderm line, &amp; told me I could search elsewhere for it.  I found it here on Amazon.com &amp; it was wayyy cheaper than if I&#x27;d found it at another dermatologist office.  Finally!  I can afford my favorite skin care!  Thank you, thank you, thank you! I had standard shipping &amp; it took less than a week to get here!  I was so happy to see the cleanser, that I bought the pore therapy toner as well as the theraputic moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Tried it for about one month.  I used this product along with the cleanser and saw little difference. Used it in the morning and night,m but at least for me very little change.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF SO MUCH!  My face always feels clean and soft after a wash and I&#x27;ve noticed that some of my smaller scars have faded away.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was 13. I&#x27;m 26 now and am prone to hormonal cyctic acne along my chin, neck and jawline. It&#x27;s painful, embarrassing, and usually leaves terrible scars. This line was introduced to me by my esthetician and it&#x27;s literally changed my skin. I use this at night combination with the Pore Therapy Toner and my skin is dewy, clear, my pores are smaller and I never break out. Because my skin is also sensitive I only use it at night, and just use Cetaphyl in the morning with sunscreen. Give it a month to start seeing results, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I&#x27;ve been loyal to this line for almost two years now and I don&#x27;t see myself ever using anything else.</li>
    <li> I swear that this cleared up my skin. I have constantly came back to this whenever I break out, and I have tried nearly everything!</li>
