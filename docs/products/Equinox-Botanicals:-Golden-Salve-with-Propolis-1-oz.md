      <li>It creates a natural healing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Golden Salve on other things with less success.</li>
      <li>In addition to cleaning up my diet, I&#x27;ve tried applying coconut butter and every kind of lotion; tea tree oil; creams containing salicylic acid; at one point I used a foot file daily until it actually made things worse; I&#x27;ve tried salt and sugar scrubs and soaks; continual cleansing and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I live in humid hot weather (Florida Keys) and cracked skin on feet is common.  </li>
      <li>I never saw it do as much for an inflamed cut or scrape, nor cure mosquito and chigger bites, as well as plain old Betadine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can NOT say enough about this wonderful product. I used it for healing my newborns circumcision and diaper rash and many other things. It works amazingly well. I have several and I give this as gifts. Oh, and a little goes a LOOOOONG way!</li>
    <li> This salve does not smell like it came from \\&quot;Bath &amp; Body Works\\&quot; and it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;The combination of ingredients in the salve come from natural ingredients from the earth over many years.  It creates a natural healing.  Surface wounds and even deep bruising from surgery, accidents (and even from abuse), are helped in the healing process through regular topical application of this salve.</li>
    <li> Okay this salve is awesome.  I&#x27;ve been using it on a sore I&#x27;ve had for more than a year.  It is the only thing that has made any different at all ( and I have tried EVERYTHING).  It is soothing and healing.  I&#x27;m not sure what the magic ingredient is but I can tell it is very good for skin issues.</li>
    <li> Works fast on just about anything. A keeper for my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I use it on my hands.  I have some very sensitive hands and it seems to help keep them healed.  Have also used it on bug bites, seems to speed up healing.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Really works!!</li>
    <li> This works.  I have used it for years.  I live in humid hot weather (Florida Keys) and cracked skin on feet is common.  This is what to use.  I am happy to find it on Amazon and at a competitive price.  It is slightly greasy but far better results than any lotion I have ever tried.  it comes in a tiny glass jar.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully for healing. I have used it many times and will continue to use it. It is safe to use and helps as an alternate treatment to use while removing skin cancers. That is what I basically use it for. However it is also good for irritated places  on the skin that needs help to heal more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is purchased at a good price from this seller and it arrived quickly , just in time for my treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks  you and may you continue to sell this item .</li>
    <li> This product may work for some and may not for others. I couldn&#x27;t  tell whether or not it was working because I find it extremely greasy so I discontinued used. Sorry people I no this is no help.</li>
    <li> am not so sure on this item... it really did not do anything for my skin so i stopped using it will try it on my feet to see if it will help making the soft</li>
    <li> Thought I would try something new.  It really works amazingly well!  My daughter uses it for several different things.  She said&lt;br /&gt;it worked great on one issue, so tried another, worked well on that and will keep using it on different issues, cause it can&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Examples: cuts, bruises and helped with healing faster.</li>
    <li> This is healing my cracked heel that nothing else ever helped. In addition to cleaning up my diet, I&#x27;ve tried applying coconut butter and every kind of lotion; tea tree oil; creams containing salicylic acid; at one point I used a foot file daily until it actually made things worse; I&#x27;ve tried salt and sugar scrubs and soaks; continual cleansing and moisturizing. This painful condition has been constant for many years. I don&#x27;t know why I never thought of trying Golden Salve on it before. It is quickly healing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Golden Salve on other things with less success. I never saw it do as much for an inflamed cut or scrape, nor cure mosquito and chigger bites, as well as plain old Betadine. I don&#x27;t know why it wouldn&#x27;t, but that was my experience.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the best salve ever made. it works awesome on any cut or injury I love it lots</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t recommend it enough. Excellent healing action, I get it in big tubs and use it for my horses too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this herbal salve for years and love it. There is no substitute.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. So much better than Vaseline!</li>
    <li> Use this on cuts and bites!  Helps speed up the healing process and within minutes takes out the itch in bites</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I use this all the time on all kinds of wounds &amp; love it.  I even mix it with my face lotion everyday, it makes my skin very soft &amp; healthy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely did not like this product. Was totally disappointed with it. The smell was so atrocious it actually made me gag! Possibly, if we could have gotten past the odor, we might have been able to use it to see if it worked! It was all about the smell....disgusting!</li>
    <li> Great for chapped lips and has helped with eczema also. As I sometimes get eczema on my hands, this is one of a few products that my skin will tolerate during a break-out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it&#x27;s great for everything - chapped skin, cuts, etc. Love it!</li>
    <li> THIS ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION.  I HAVE NOT NOTICED A QUICKER HEALING TIME ON CUTS, BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THIS AND SEE.</li>
    <li> I tried it a couple of times, and it&#x27;s ok. Somewhat greasy though. I prefer to use my normal face creams.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best healing salve I have ever purchased. Great for all cuts and scrapes. Heals quickly and is very soothing.</li>
