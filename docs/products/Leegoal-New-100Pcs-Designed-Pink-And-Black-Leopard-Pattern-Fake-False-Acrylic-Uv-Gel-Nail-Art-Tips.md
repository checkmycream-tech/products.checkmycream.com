    <li> My girls love the print easy to apply</li>
    <li> There was one cracked nail in the set, but other than that no complaints! They look great and the pattern is dark, even with a fairly thick layer of acrylic over it. Time will tell how strong they are, but I&#x27;m pleased so far.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used these a few times before reviewing to give an accurate review. These nails are indeed pretty, and look great when combined with a pink acrylic powder but they are cheap and flimsy. What can you expect for the price right? My acrylic nails are always strong but these nails are still flimsy no matter how much acrylic you use. I personally do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered these but got Grey black and silver Zebra print. Since they&#x27;re shipped out of Hong Kong I won&#x27;t make a huge fuss about it. The zebra print is pretty cool though.</li>
