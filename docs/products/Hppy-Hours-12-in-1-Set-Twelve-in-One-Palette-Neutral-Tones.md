      <li>So happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this palette, the colors are great....  </li>
      <li>One thing i love is the brush it comes with which is awesome for blending!!!</li>
      <li>It works well with a good primer so invest in a good one that will keep your eye make up on all day.</li>
      <li>These are good color</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s super gorgeous and awesome!</li>
      <li>Amazing quality and amazing price!</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more of these soon!</li>
      <li>AmaZing. ....</li>
      <li>omg the quality on this thing is amazing.</li>
      <li>albeit a good one. :-)</li>
      <li>Colors true to picture, great pigment, speedy shipping.</li>
      <li>I still think it&#x27;s well worth the purchase, the colors are great and I kind of like the purple.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve been wanting an eyeshadow palette for cheap this is a good one.</li>
      <li>Overall love it and use it often :D</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it price wise.</li>
      <li>The colors are great and are good to wear on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>even more excited when I pulled out the palette :)</li>
      <li>The colors are smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>Loved actually naked pallet</li>
      <li>Excellent value - very similar to the Naked 2 palette.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m very satisfied and will definitely repurchase!</li>
      <li>These took a couple of weeks to arrive, but when they did they were 100% worth it.</li>
      <li>This palette is 100% worth your money</li>
      <li>The biggest differences I saw was the case is a slightly different color and the color &amp;#34;busted&amp;#34; was more of a purple color, rather than a mauve type color like the palette I saw at Ulta.  </li>
      <li>Colors are very pigmented and are long lasting and the colors are just beautiful themselves.</li>
      <li>It is pretty pigmented and works well all for $8.</li>
      <li>the colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented</li>
      <li>You really have to build up on color for it to show.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so inexpensive and it came fast.</li>
      <li>is if you had the real deal to compare it to.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price and the shadows are nice and creamy with very little fallout.</li>
      <li>I Highly Recommend buying this.</li>
      <li>so if you don&#x27;t mind waiting for a good cheap, yet working fake naked 2 palette</li>
      <li>As others have said, both the packaging and colors make this a near-perfect knockoff of the Naked 2 palette, with apparently identical packaging--the only way you&#x27;d be able to tell this was a dupe</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty much identical to the Naked 2 palette, and unless you&#x27;re a super obsessed connoisseur, you would not be able to tell the difference by just looking at this one alone.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re considering buying the actual Naked2 palette, in my experience with both I can tell you the authentic one is slightly easier to apply and shows up a little more.</li>
      <li>The case has the naked 2 name on it, but I took it to Ulta and compared it with the original Naked 2 palette.  </li>
      <li>Comes in a box and the pallete is in tin with all the Naked 2 swatches (+brush), &amp; looks like a real one!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s says &amp;#34;NAKED 2 URBAN DECAY&amp;#34; I was so excited when the box it came in said urban decay on it and</li>
      <li>If its not the real deal its as close to it as it possibly can be!</li>
      <li>The price is incomparable (even less than some drugstore eyeshadows?!)</li>
      <li>No need to spend big $$$ from urban decay when you can buy this gem right here.</li>
      <li>They came in Urban Decay packaging and the container looks exactly like it would an actual Naked Palette.</li>
      <li>The mirror is the only thing that is different than someone would expect from urban decay but other than that it&#x27;s exactly what you would purchase from urban decay!</li>

<li> Wow!&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited and kept looking out the window to see if the mailman got my eyeshadows.the shopping took ten days :( .</li>
<li> Only $8 something for a fake Naked 2 Pallete!</li>
<li> The case isn&#x27;t plain like it shows in the pictures</li>
<li> Nevertheless, when I say &amp;#34;slightly&amp;#34;, I really mean slightly.</li>
<li> so i have to re apply it throughout the day which i find annoying.</li>

    <li> These are good color but it took long time to come....by the time it came, all the are chipped</li>

    <li> AmaZing. .... best dupe</li>
    <li> I am very very happy with the colors.......  however, it&#x27;s NOT the Naked 2 palette,  The case has the naked 2 name on it, but I took it to Ulta and compared it with the original Naked 2 palette.  The biggest differences I saw was the case is a slightly different color and the color &amp;#34;busted&amp;#34; was more of a purple color, rather than a mauve type color like the palette I saw at Ulta.  I still think it&#x27;s well worth the purchase, the colors are great and I kind of like the purple.  I would recommend this palette, the colors are great....  but it is just a dupe...  albeit a good one. :-)</li>
    <li> These took a couple of weeks to arrive, but when they did they were 100% worth it. They came in Urban Decay packaging and the container looks exactly like it would an actual Naked Palette. It&#x27;s beautiful. A few of the colors are slightly off; however, when I compared it to my mom&#x27;s authentic Naked palette we both agreed that we prefered this one&#x27;s slight color variations. It&#x27;s pretty much identical to the Naked 2 palette, and unless you&#x27;re a super obsessed connoisseur, you would not be able to tell the difference by just looking at this one alone.

Nevertheless, when I say &amp;#34;slightly&amp;#34;, I really mean slightly. This palette is 100% worth your money and it&#x27;s super gorgeous and awesome!</li>
    <li> I Highly Recommend buying this. Its The real naked 2 Palette! If its not the real deal its as close to it as it possibly can be! So happy with this purchase. The colors are great and are good to wear on a daily basis. No need to spend big $$$ from urban decay when you can buy this gem right here. I will be buying more of these soon!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Colors true to picture, great pigment, speedy shipping. Only took 8days but was expecting to wait 2 months.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been wanting an eyeshadow palette for cheap this is a good one. If you&#x27;re not sure &amp; wary of sellers selling you non pigmented, bad quality, etc type of palettes, like me, &amp; trying to find a good one for cheap then I suggest buying this palette. Only $8 something for a fake Naked 2 Pallete! Comes in a box and the pallete is in tin with all the Naked 2 swatches (+brush), &amp; looks like a real one! It is pretty pigmented and works well all for $8. Takes a while to get delivered tho so if you don&#x27;t mind waiting for a good cheap, yet working fake naked 2 palette then this is the palette for you!</li>
    <li> The order was great! My phone won&#x27;t let me put five stars, but it is definitely 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Adore the colors on this palette and the case this came with. Overall love it and use it often :D</li>
    <li> Great product and the seller was an excellent vendor.</li>
    <li> Decent shadows with only a little fallout.  Definitely worth it price wise.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews saying that it&#x27;s a replica of the naked 2 palette. It&#x27;s not a replica, it&#x27;s actually the naked 2 palette! The case isn&#x27;t plain like it shows in the pictures it&#x27;s says &amp;#34;NAKED 2 URBAN DECAY&amp;#34; I was so excited when the box it came in said urban decay on it and even more excited when I pulled out the palette :) it&#x27;s so inexpensive and it came fast. The mirror is foggy and scratched but I don&#x27;t care at all because I would never use that mirror anyways. The mirror is the only thing that is different than someone would expect from urban decay but other than that it&#x27;s exactly what you would purchase from urban decay!</li>
    <li> As others have said, both the packaging and colors make this a near-perfect knockoff of the Naked 2 palette, with apparently identical packaging--the only way you&#x27;d be able to tell this was a dupe is if you had the real deal to compare it to. The price is incomparable (even less than some drugstore eyeshadows?!), given the quantity of shadows and overall quality of the packaging.</li>
    <li> omg the quality on this thing is amazing. No wonder its the best</li>
    <li> Loved actually naked pallet</li>
    <li> Amazing quality and amazing price! Would definitely recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> Excellent value - very similar to the Naked 2 palette. Can&#x27;t beat the price and the shadows are nice and creamy with very little fallout.</li>
