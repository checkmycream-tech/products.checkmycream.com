<ol>
      <li>Very happy with this product</li>
      <li>Always the best lash primer out there.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product for priming your eyelashes before you use mascara.  </li>
      <li>Best mascara.</li>
      <li>Best primer out there</li>
      <li>The best lash primer I&#x27;ve found and with the convenience of ordering it from AmazonPrime...</li>
      <li>I buy this product all the time and it is the best.  </li>
      <li>And the best part is that I can remove the mascara with ease at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>Great to give lashes length before applying mascara.  </li>
      <li>Great product .</li>
      <li>Great addition to the Sumptuous Mascara.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying for things that are great.  </li>
      <li>Very nice product.</li>
      <li>This primer is amazing!</li>
      <li>I read where mascara may stay on longer and not flake if a good lash primer is used before mascara application.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame because it is a good product just not this time around.</li>
      <li>Just as good as Lancôme but cheaper.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>This primer is amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of pricey</li>
      <li>When used in conjunction with Estee Lauder&#x27;s More Than Mascara, my lashes are longer and lovelier than they would be without the primer.</li>
      <li>When I use it, my mascara stays on better with no smearing.</li>
      <li>so I couldn&#x27;t use it more than one time.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and I wanted to be able to enhance my eyelashes by using the Estee Lauder eyelash primer.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t have to go to the mall for it.</li>
      <li>so I was very excited when I saw they have it here.  </li>
      <li>Used this product years ago, so I am very familiar with it.  </li>
      <li>I use the Lash Primer Plus to make my eye lashes look longer and more full.  </li>
      <li>This is perfectly acceptable for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Importantly, the primer just makes my lashes look better, not fake.</li>
      <li>My mascara is waterproof, but after 4-6 hours still flakes some, and if worn longer, I need to clean up the under eye area.</li>
      <li>so it ran out quickly.</li>
      <li>Many days I only wear it, no mascara on top.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>I first tried it as a sample and have been purchasing it ever since.</li>
      <li>I have tried about 5-6 other products and so far this one is the best, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Before using is this, the effect can also be, this time to buy is not used, as in the past good hope</li>
      <li>Very slimy; like you put mineral oil on your eyes.</li>
      <li>I am 61 and my lashes are not as full as when I was younger.  </li>
      <li>Also saw no other benefit to it, and I did use it several times before deciding it was nothing special.</li>
      <li>All my other ones have been smooth and lasted for months.  </li>
      <li>Very disappointing as Estee Lauder&#x27;s skin care products have always been excellent.</li>
      <li>Product was probably old, would not procure it again from either the seller or  Estee Lauder.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s old sticky and clumpy - will never waist my money like this again -</li>
      <li>I think this one was old to begin with.</li>
      <li>Whether I cleanse with expensive eye makeup remover or just mild soap, the mascara comes off cleanly.</li>
      <li>Little on the (very large) brush with each application.</li>

<li> If you want super long lashes without false eyelashes</li>
<li> My lashes are so long with this</li>
<li> Then they start to dry out.  </li>
<li> It smudged, did not hold a curl, actually weighed my naturally long eyelashes down.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe how it makes my little bottom and inner lashes stand out!</li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t want pink eye or anything else.</li>
<li> I am comparing this to Tarte and Blinc primer which I like....not all that I expected from The Lauder brand.</li>
<li> I have tried one other brand and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of difference.</li>
<li> When I got it,  it was dried up inside and only a small amount came out</li>
<li> so it was a let down.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t stand having black smudge marks under my eyes after washing my face.</li>
<li> I use it when I apply mascara as it allows you to use less mascara.</li>
<li> For the price I was disappointed in the quality and the tube is pretty dry.</li>
<li> I saved a few bucks shopping with you.</li>
<li> However, this one that arrived was partially dried out already.  </li>
<li> I would go so far to say this is the absolute worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought in my life.</li>
<li> I am not saying is bad or it hurt my lashes, but really I don&#x27;t see the difference or the use really.&lt;br</li>
<li> I use it everyday (and have for 4 years) and it keeps my mascara where it belongs!</li>
<li> What a waste of money!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not spectacular and it gets the job done.</li>
<li> The primer was sample size and not a good value.</li>
<li> It is so expensive at the mall.</li>
<li> Disappointed to say the least since I didnt need mascara</li>
<li> size which was disappointing</li>
<li> SO disappointed....</li>
<li> Disappointed with the results.</li>
<li> I was disappointed.  </li>
<li> I was very unhappy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tube is &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; size which was disappointing but it works and does keep the lashes curled even after mascara is applied...size of container does not justify the cost of the product.</li>
    <li> Before using is this, the effect can also be, this time to buy is not used, as in the past good hope</li>
    <li> This primer is amazing. Many days I only wear it, no mascara on top. It is pretty small so it ran out quickly. I can&#x27;t believe how it makes my little bottom and inner lashes stand out!</li>
    <li> I use it when I apply mascara as it allows you to use less mascara.</li>
    <li> SO disappointed....this was a &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; size, not for resale.  I got held up on this one.  Product was probably old, would not procure it again from either the seller or  Estee Lauder.</li>
    <li> It does keep the mascara from clumping, but did not curl or increase lash volume.  I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this product so I was very excited when I saw they have it here.  When I got it,  it was dried up inside and only a small amount came out so I couldn&#x27;t use it more than one time.  It&#x27;s kind of pricey so it was a let down.  I don&#x27;t mind paying for things that are great.  I do mind paying for  things that are not usable.</li>
    <li> Very slimy; like you put mineral oil on your eyes. It smudged, did not hold a curl, actually weighed my naturally long eyelashes down. Very disappointing as Estee Lauder&#x27;s skin care products have always been excellent. I would go so far to say this is the absolute worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought in my life.</li>
    <li> Used this product years ago, so I am very familiar with it.  That is why I ordered it again.  Just had an eyelid lift and fat removal from my sagging eyelids (Bilateral Blepharoplasty and Lipectomy) and I wanted to be able to enhance my eyelashes by using the Estee Lauder eyelash primer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I first tried it as a sample and have been purchasing it ever since. This lash primer does just that,it prepares  your eyelashes for mascara. When I use it, my mascara stays on better with no smearing. And the best part is that I can remove the mascara with ease at the end of the day. I can&#x27;t stand having black smudge marks under my eyes after washing my face. Whether I cleanse with expensive eye makeup remover or just mild soap, the mascara comes off cleanly. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> Totally work the price. Way cheaper here. Best mascara. So glad I didn&#x27;t have to go to the mall for it. I&#x27;m always complimented on my lashes and asked what I use.</li>
    <li> It is a sample! You are paying all that money for a sample. It was not sealed; you have to take the sellers word that it has never been used. I don&#x27;t know about you but I don&#x27;t want pink eye or anything else. It is also not the size the seller says it is; the product is smaller. I was very unhappy. I sent it back. I got my money back, however, I did not get my shipping back. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I never do reviews. I always keep everything I buy, however, this I could not. I was very disappointed when I received it in the mail.</li>
    <li> This seems to protect from breakage and helps curl them before mascara. I have tried one other brand and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of difference.</li>
    <li> Thank you. My mother in law loves this product. It is so expensive at the mall. I saved a few bucks shopping with you. Best primer out there</li>
    <li> I ordered primer plus and received a trial size of mascara.  Not what I ordered.  Disappointed to say the least since I didnt need mascara and it was a sample size like you would get as part of a bonus.  What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Always the best lash primer out there.</li>
    <li> Great product . Just as good as Lancôme but cheaper. Worth the money. Sephora stopped making it so I had to find another one. Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I read where mascara may stay on longer and not flake if a good lash primer is used before mascara application. This product did not help that at all. I will continue to look for one that does. My mascara is waterproof, but after 4-6 hours still flakes some, and if worn longer, I need to clean up the under eye area. Disappointed with the results. Also saw no other benefit to it, and I did use it several times before deciding it was nothing special.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  The primer was sample size and not a good value.</li>
    <li> I use the Lash Primer Plus to make my eye lashes look longer and more full.  It works.</li>
    <li> I buy this product all the time and it is the best.  However, this one that arrived was partially dried out already.  It goes on so clumpy I look like I have spider eyes.  All my other ones have been smooth and lasted for months.  Then they start to dry out.  I think this one was old to begin with.</li>
    <li> Been using it for YEARS...over 10.  The best lash primer I&#x27;ve found and with the convenience of ordering it from AmazonPrime...it&#x27;s a winner in my book.</li>
    <li> This product delivers everything it promises. It boosts the length and volume of my lashes and also acts as a curing agent. When used in conjunction with Estee Lauder&#x27;s More Than Mascara, my lashes are longer and lovelier than they would be without the primer. Importantly, the primer just makes my lashes look better, not fake. This is perfectly acceptable for everyday use. I love it!</li>
    <li> This mascara is just like all the others. It&#x27;s not spectacular and it gets the job done. It does sometimes clump though.</li>
    <li> If you want super long lashes without false eyelashes this is the products for you.  Great addition to the Sumptuous Mascara.  My lashes are so long with this they hit the lenses on my sun glasses</li>
    <li> This primer is amazing! I use it everyday (and have for 4 years) and it keeps my mascara where it belongs! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I got this at a friend&#x27;s suggestion. I am not saying is bad or it hurt my lashes, but really I don&#x27;t see the difference or the use really.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just using the EL mascara.</li>
    <li> muy buen producto la suegra encantada con esto lo unico es que deberian envalarlo mas peque&amp;ntilde;o para que el envio no sea tan costoso</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for priming your eyelashes before you use mascara.  I have tried about 5-6 other products and so far this one is the best, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I am comparing this to Tarte and Blinc primer which I like....not all that I expected from The Lauder brand. For the price I was disappointed in the quality and the tube is pretty dry. Little on the (very large) brush with each application. Kind of awkward getting to tiny corner lashes with the fat giant brush. Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t put on mascare with out EL lash primer plus.... have used this for years, and makes a big difference in how your mascare goes on and stays on and looks.</li>
    <li> Makes lashes look thicker</li>
    <li> Great to give lashes length before applying mascara.  I am 61 and my lashes are not as full as when I was younger.  This helps to add length to my lashes.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and purchased it from Dillards - not this time and what a mistake.  It&#x27;s old sticky and clumpy - will never waist my money like this again - I will go back to Dillards.  It&#x27;s a shame because it is a good product just not this time around.</li>
    <li> It is a sample. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
