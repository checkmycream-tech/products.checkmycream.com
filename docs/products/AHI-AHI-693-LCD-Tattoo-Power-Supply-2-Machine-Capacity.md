<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bought this last year and its still working well no complaints</li>
    <li> I ordered  this when I my Lucky Tattoo Supplies power supply bit the dust.I think it is a decent back up to have around the shop, but I would not be thrilled to use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t run at a low enough voltage to keep my shader at a purr for black and gray, and I feel the voltage is not very consistent.</li>
    <li> I had one in the past and I liked that one till my brother&#x27;s PSu went out on him so i bought me another one and gave him this one ... ( the one I had) and I&#x27;m glad i bought me another one.. loved it...</li>
    <li> been using this box now for a while with no problems, shipped on time, works good!</li>
    <li> From what I have done is test my guns and it&#x27;s seems ok exept it run to well on some of my 10 rap coil guns but I guess I will fined out soon.</li>
    <li> After a few adjustments my husband has found that it runs with his current machines beautifully. He loves the dual input.</li>
    <li> I ordered this power supply about a month already and so far it hasnt gave me any problems. Good for starters.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband and it works great. No issues so far :)he loves it and i loved that price! :)</li>
    <li> Waist of time and money.</li>
    <li> I recieved this item less than 48 hours after placing my order!!!! Was very impressed with the early delivery! Great quality and seems to work great! I would have rated 5 stars if I would have actually recieved 2 clip cords instead of just 1 but thats an easy fix I already e mailed the sender about this. I have a coil machine I plugged into the power supply to test it out and seems to work although I havn&#x27;t actually put it to work yet. I&#x27;m still waiting on my new rotary machine to arrive I look forward to testing that out on this. Overall, assuming I won&#x27;t have any problems I am very pleased with this purchase would highly recomend to anyone reading this!</li>
    <li> Its a good beginner setup. The numbers fluctuate randomly but the machine holds good steady power. Strong enough to handle the basics.</li>
    <li> i was shocked because it was so cheap wasn&#x27;t sure on getting it, but it works great and, looks like new, and i love it, i haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.</li>
    <li> Unit arrived and was missing the foot pedal. I was forced to return it and buy one locally. Be wary.</li>
    <li> When u switch it over to 220v it dont work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Numbers disappear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An dont work on 220v&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that its cool</li>
    <li> really bad product didnt even last me a week before it started showing a lot of issues and even smoke and the timer broke.</li>
    <li> It arrived early, and was all as pictured and described. If you need a good power supply this is a good one for the money and the extra clip cords and foot petal make it a steal. Also being a american company and ships from america makes it even better. It would be 5 stars but I have not used it yet but I hooked it up and every thing works like it should, I would but this product from this seller angin for sure</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this product. The power supply never worked, I sent it to a professional and he told me that the machine came with internal issues.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! WORKS GREAT! ONE OF THE BEST POWER SUPPLIES I&#x27;VE EVER HAD. AND I WILL TELL THE OTHER ARTIST I KNOW TO BUY ONE.</li>
    <li> i bought the same exact power supply for 40 dollars in the past...(it lasted a year). considering the price i had to order it..got it within 4 days.. brand new with clip cord and pedal....ran it it runs good .have yet to use it for work but will write another review when i  do</li>

    <li> I was very lucky to stumble across this for the price I paid this thing goes for almost 100 buck on most tattoo web sites and it shipped super fast and was packed carefully</li>

    <li> Would not hold steady power.  Traded out cords &amp; pedals, to no avail.  Useless.</li>
    <li> Its good so far but well c how long it last and it don&#x27;t go out in month or two hope it last awhile</li>
