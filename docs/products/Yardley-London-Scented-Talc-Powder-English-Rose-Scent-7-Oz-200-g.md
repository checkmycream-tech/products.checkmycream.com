      <li>It also has more of the &#x27;old grandma&#x27; rose scent to it, and does not last more than an hour after application.</li>
      <li>The English Rose Talcum Powder is for my daughter, she couldn&#x27;t find any available in the United States and asked me to check Amazon&lt;br /&gt;web site.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased that it actually smelled like roses.  </li>
      <li>Smells exactly like I&#x27;d hoped!</li>
      <li>I have been using yardley english rose talc for years.</li>
      <li>I buy Yardleys English Rose for my mother every year.  </li>
      <li>This will make it slide right off and leave you feeling fresh.</li>
      <li>It is old-fashioned and at the same time so refreshingly now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this Rose Talc for years, ever since other manufacturers ceased making floral powders.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to shake it out of the container (which is super cute, BTW).</li>
      <li>But their products are always well made and high quality.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this item, but it is a little think and corn starchy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but I am willing to pay extra, in this case, to smell like a fragrant rose.  </li>
      <li>There are very few scented body powders made any more</li>
      <li>A lovely, delicate fragrance.</li>
      <li>they sure took a loooog time to decide it was not good for you.</li>
      <li>I was a little disapointed that it was not more Rose sented</li>
      <li>She has a sensitive nose, so I bought a back up in case this didn&#x27;t jive with her.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the real Yardley. This supplier sent a knock off so Amazon refunded me. If it&#x27;s not a bright pink can with a batch number and date, it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
    <li> I have been using yardley english rose talc for years. It is the smoothest talc and the most accurate rose fragrance that you can find. I reccommend this to Anyone who likes rose fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find Yardley&#x27;s Rose Talc! My sister loves this and it is hard to find. Good to know where to get it now.</li>
    <li> This powder is nice and has a smoth feel.  I was a little disapointed that it was not more Rose sented but I guess we cant have everything.</li>
    <li> This talc had a very  faint smell of roses. I&#x27;m not one for overly strong scents, but this didn&#x27;t meet even my meager standards. Next time will try a different brand. I hesitate to recommend this.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to find this. There are very few scented body powders made any more and I love the floral scents. I was pleased with the price and shipping,</li>
    <li> This smelled like it was made in the 60&#x27;s and smells like decaying flesh. I will not buy from this company again. This did not smell like any rose I know unless it was on a corpse.</li>
    <li> gave for a gift and she was thrilled.  too strong for me and my asthma but i already knew that but my beautician loves it so i got it for her.  she feels the same way not clean without talcum powder which is what we grew up using.  they sure took a loooog time to decide it was not good for you.</li>
    <li> The talc was delivered  promptly and in perfect  condition...my only issue was that it was in the light-pink container not the dark one...it may be my imagination,but I think the dark pink container has a stronger scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this Rose Talc for years, ever since other manufacturers ceased making floral powders. I don&#x27;t like to wear food.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but I am willing to pay extra, in this case, to smell like a fragrant rose.  Luscious.</li>
    <li> I love this talc, and the scent is heavenly...like walking in a rose garden.  Since I usually use body lotion (my skin is dry) I use the talc for sachets to put in my dresser drawers, AND it&#x27;s wonderful sprinkled on fresh sheets on your bed, and a little sprinkled on your pillow.  If you&#x27;re at the beach and don&#x27;t have a shower immediately handy, this talc is good to use when you dry off and have sand and salt on your skin.  This will make it slide right off and leave you feeling fresh. I always have this handy.</li>
    <li> Smells exactly like I&#x27;d hoped!</li>
    <li> The English Rose Talcum Powder is for my daughter, she couldn&#x27;t find any available in the United States and asked me to check Amazon&lt;br /&gt;web site.  She was so happy to get it.</li>
    <li> Did not care a lot for the rose scent...but it was a gift to me from someone.  But their products are always well made and high quality.</li>
    <li> This powder is so delicious, it is as if the rose petals were pulverized to make the powder itself that&#x27;s how pure it is.Yardley rocks..........</li>
    <li> A beautiful product.  Quality talc - no fillers.  A lovely, delicate fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a rose scented talc.  Since I trusted Yardley London products, I gave it a try.  I was very pleased that it actually smelled like roses.  I also wanted it in a shaker container instead of a puff.  The container and scent kind of have an old fashioned appeal.  I would recommend this talc if you are looking for a powder with a rose scent at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom as a gift. Cute packaging. She has a sensitive nose, so I bought a back up in case this didn&#x27;t jive with her. She loves the scent.</li>
    <li> This powder might be ok if it were usable.  The tin shaker container is made so thin and cheap that it dents and the seams split, spilling all over, including in the delivery envelope.  Makes it unusable if the tin shaker can&#x27;t stand up to a bit of handling.  Super disappointed.</li>
    <li> If you enjoy the fragrance of beautiful, fresh roses; then, you will absolutely love this talcum powder.  It is old-fashioned and at the same time so refreshingly now.</li>
    <li> If you love the true sent of Roses, you will love this product.  I buy Yardleys English Rose for my mother every year.  She loves the wonderful light smell of Springtime Roses...her favorite product.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful.  The price was great and I&#x27;m glad I got it.  I also like another brand, but Yardley is great too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several Yardley Talcum powder in the past from several countries. This one has a lighter pink color and the scent is much more subtle than the ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past. It also has more of the &#x27;old grandma&#x27; rose scent to it, and does not last more than an hour after application. The powder still has its trademark fine texture though.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this item, but it is a little think and corn starchy. I thought it might be looser. It&#x27;s hard to shake it out of the container (which is super cute, BTW). Overall, I am on the fence about re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> Good price and seem like quality product</li>
