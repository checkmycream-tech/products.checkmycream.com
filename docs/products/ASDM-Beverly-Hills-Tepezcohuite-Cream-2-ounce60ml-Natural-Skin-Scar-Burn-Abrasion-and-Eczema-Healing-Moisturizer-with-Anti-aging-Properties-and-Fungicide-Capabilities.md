      <li>It&#x27;s great for healing minor skin eruptions.  </li>
      <li>, I wasn&#x27;t able to use it right away because I would out of the country, so I will need more time to see just how much I continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I love this so much</li>
      <li>LOVE tis cream, for me it really works.</li>
      <li>So far it is really nice to use.  </li>
      <li>This cream healed a burn on my sons foot rather quickly.</li>
      <li>price is more than I would normally pay</li>
      <li>First cream that didn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
      <li>Not as good as expected</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a must-have, but I do like it better than my Olay (Complete every day</li>
      <li>It felt very nice going onto my skin and did not feel heavy at all.</li>
      <li>Not sure if my fine lines are improved, but I do find that it makes a good moisturizer and</li>
      <li>and i got an oil burn right by my nose</li>
      <li>Makes my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>so I left the lid off for a day and most of the fragrance disappeared.</li>
      <li>It really does moisturize and heal!</li>
      <li>I definitely plan on buying more when this runs out</li>
      <li>I have acne-prone, combination skin that leans more towards the dry side.</li>
      <li>My skin is super soft, and still minimal breakouts (I&#x27;ve always had them so this isn&#x27;t giving me more breakouts</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t think any one thing is the cure.</li>
      <li>VERY SOOTHING CREAM.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps too heavy now the warm weather is upon us, but could still use as a night cream.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous healing skin cream - I usually use it after I have done a strong skin peel on my face to subdue the reddness or any irritated skin patches on my face.</li>
      <li>but so far I like it very much.</li>
      <li>29 years old I am working on aging prevention and tryin to really focus on taking care of my self.</li>

      <li>IT ACTUALLY MAKES YOUR SKIN SMOOTH AND TIGHT,</li>
      <li>I expected a little more from this.</li>
      <li>It feels rather heavy going on, but soaks in quickly.</li>
      <li>this worked for me---reduced a large pimple down by 98 percent in 2 days.(i was like, please not another</li>
      <li>My face feels and looks so much softer and the dark spots on my face are fading.</li>
      <li>Not too bad, and I feel like the jar will last forever so the cost is more than reasonable when compared to something like olay regenerist.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not what I expected. It was oily...then I found out it had Emu oil....not what a vegetarian wanted to read.</li>
    <li> Final review: I&#x27;ve finished the jar, and I maintain a 4 star review. I like it. It&#x27;s still got a strong but quickly-evaporating rose scent, but my face feels great even in the middle of summer-I use it once a day now that it&#x27;s summertime instead of twice (at night before bed to undo some damage from sun, pool chemicals, etc) I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a must-have, but I do like it better than my Olay (Complete every day moisturizer  and the firming night cream in the pink jar).  Update: 10 days in, I use it every morning and every night before I go to bed. It&#x27;s awesome. My skin is super soft, and still minimal breakouts (I&#x27;ve always had them so this isn&#x27;t giving me more breakouts but it&#x27;s not eliminating them either). Not too bad, and I feel like the jar will last forever so the cost is more than reasonable when compared to something like olay regenerist.  I am in my late 30s, have super pale/combination skin that is not prone to sensitivity, and not a whole lot going on in the wrinkle/damage department. My face can get dry in the winter with some flaking on my cheek/nose and oily on my forehead/nose in the summer. I just started using this (two days ago). It absorbed quickly, and I haven&#x27;t broken out yet. I like it quite a bit and have no problem with the absorbtion (I also use a witchhazel toner in the mornings before applying). The smell is a bit..funky, but it fades very quickly and you won&#x27;t notice it at all.  As for any repair results-I&#x27;ll update in a month or when I finish the jar.</li>
    <li> This cream is so wonderful, especially if your skin is acne prone, because it is nourishing but not greasy.</li>
    <li> meh.  made my face break out.  nothing to rave about.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  Not greasy and feels great!</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks my skin is smoother and has a new glow to it.</li>
    <li> Not very satisfied Greg</li>
    <li> I love how moisturizing it is.</li>
    <li> I was having radiation treatment and was told that the cream  would help......not. It burned my already burned skin.&lt;br /&gt;Would not reccomend this over priced non working product!</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for a couple of weeks. I want to give it more time but so far I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Works great! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love this face cream. My face feels and looks so much softer and the dark spots on my face are fading. I will be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> just started using it and so far so good, item as described</li>
    <li> Amazing cream!  It really does moisturize and heal!</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It is a bit heavy during the summer for a daytime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> LOVE tis cream, for me it really works. Perhaps too heavy now the warm weather is upon us, but could still use as a night cream.</li>
    <li> Removes redness, great for hydration, &amp; at an affordable price point.  Feels healthy on my skin.  I will repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> I have ivory/pale peaches and cream skin tone. 29 years old I am working on aging prevention and tryin to really focus on taking care of my self. I still have occasional break outs, uneven skin tone and dryness. I love this stuff!!! It has balanced my skin, there is a beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Glow, breakouts are gone and I look better without makeup on. I put it on morning and night and if I do wear under makeup, it makes my makeup easier to apply and looks better. The price is fair and you do not need a lot of product. I love this so much I went back and ordered the serum. Can&#x27;t wait to try that with my cream!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have acne-prone, combination skin that leans more towards the dry side. This moisturizer does not leave my skin feeling dry or tight like some other moisturizers that I have used and it does not sit on top of my skin like a greasy mess. It sinks in leaving my skin moisturized and feeling soft and supple. I do feel it aids in the healing of my acne break outs and has helped my post acne inflammation (PAI) heal quicker. My PAI used to last up to several months and now it is taking a few weeks at most for it to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has not cured my acne but I really don&#x27;t think any one thing is the cure. I personally feel my acne is a hormonal issue which needs to be addressed internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is more than I would normally pay but I have no problem paying for it. I love that it is made of natural ingredients, including healthy probiotics, and that it provides such great results. I definitely plan on buying more when this runs out and I want to try some other moisturizers created by ASDM.</li>
    <li> So far it is really nice to use.  Creamy, moisturizes great, smells great.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Can&#x27;t believe the change in my stretch marks post baby 13 years now.  I also use it with my Tendlite 660 light for c-section scar.</li>
    <li> this worked for me---reduced a large pimple down by 98 percent in 2 days.(i was like, please not another breakout)..........I got a sample in the mail, and dabbed some on---doubting that it would do a good job, but it did............it worked better than a name brand acne cream.  It is definitely a keeper.  i heard its good for rashed too.</li>
    <li> No difference! no improvement despite following instructions.  Two good things are the price was reasonable so I don&#x27;t feel that I wasted money and no rashes on my face.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I does what it claims to do. Love it. Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for healing minor skin eruptions.  Seems to heal them quicker for me than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  Not sure if my fine lines are improved, but I do find that it makes a good moisturizer and my sensitive skin is (so far) not breaking out or irritated.  Been using this semi-regularly for two weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m alergic to it.  Made my face burn and itch.  Peeled for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this since it received so many positive reviews, but sadly I was disappointed.  It felt very nice going onto my skin and did not feel heavy at all. However after 3-4 days of using this product my skin became very dry and started peeling.  It didn&#x27;t do anything for my acne... in fact, it probably made it worse. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Good lotion but hasnt changed my face/ lines/ wrinkles. I expected a little more from this.</li>
    <li> Not as good as expected</li>
    <li> This cream healed a burn on my sons foot rather quickly. I also use to as a face cream and it does a great job moisturizing! It feels rather heavy going on, but soaks in quickly.</li>
    <li> Very good product!!!!</li>
    <li> Makes your skin soft and feels so good day and night.  I can see the difference in my skin.  Having dry skin and after trying many products,  at a great expense,  this is the one that has taken away the pain and dryness of my hands.  It has been ten years into finding a product to heal my hands and this is the one.</li>
    <li> Use this after chemical peel.  Works as claimed and well worth the money!! My skin is getting better and better the longer I use the Tepezcohuie Cream.</li>
    <li> love this product. makes my skin feel healthy</li>
    <li> Love the cream.  My skin is hydrated and soft from using this cream. Will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> Perfect. I am super sensitive and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> i work in the kitchen and i got an oil burn right by my nose, i used this cream on it and you can hard see the scar , i have used Tepezcouite creams before however this one is more effective , i love it</li>
    <li> So far I like it, I wasn&#x27;t able to use it right away because I would out of the country, so I will need more time to see just how much I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous healing skin cream - I usually use it after I have done a strong skin peel on my face to subdue the reddness or any irritated skin patches on my face.</li>
    <li> VERY SOOTHING CREAM.  IT ACTUALLY MAKES YOUR SKIN SMOOTH AND TIGHT, AS IN A WRINKLE CREAM.  I WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> First cream that didn&#x27;t break me out! Makes my skin very soft and smooth. It does have a strong odor so I left the lid off for a day and most of the fragrance disappeared. Love this stuff!</li>
