      <li>So yes the product works great, and I will continue to use it.  </li>
      <li>Very nice..</li>
      <li>But it would be nice to not have a neck stain!  </li>
      <li>if you want good quality henna, can not get it on Amazon,  but search the web for it.</li>
      <li>a good experience</li>
      <li>Good luck</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the so called healthy hair dye and this is the best.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Okay- where to start with this product!  </li>
      <li>On Sunday before running errands I made the henna paste with warm distilled water and lime juice</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I never intend on using it again.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to try a dye that would be good for my hair and wasn&#x27;t tested on animals (which I love about this stuff).</li>
      <li>but saying all that I have to say the product is good on Hairs if it stays on Hairs. :-)</li>
      <li>It came out beautifully and very shiny and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>First, it always works best right after a haircut.</li>
      <li>you should look like the Riddler :)&lt;</li>
      <li>I find using plastic food wrap works much better than a shower cap or the cap that comes with the product.  </li>
      <li>Henna all the way :)</li>
      <li>I followed the directions and made sure to not use any metal that would contaminate the color outcome.  </li>
      <li>Love henna, and love this brand.</li>
      <li>: Most of it came out by just letting the shower head run over my hair for a while.</li>
      <li>I find using plastic food wrap works much better than a shower cap or the cap that comes with the product.  </li>
      <li>and he said one more time</li>
      <li>medium-light brown (many varying shades)</li>
      <li>I love the color though.</li>
      <li>It is a plant, safe for your health and it will not cause cancer, as it has no chemical additives.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t cover all of it, but I think that was more my fault in not spreading it on all my hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, now when I use it, I just make sure to do it on a weekend so that it will be brown before I go to work.</li>
      <li>But after all the hassles keeping the mud on my head for hours, I hope the product can perform better.</li>
      <li>(Okay maybe not the well,</li>
      <li>But then as the years pass the gray hair would appear more and more and it bugged me a lot</li>
      <li>I love it..</li>
      <li>My hair came out a beautiful rich brown and feels very soft.</li>
      <li>I will continue buying Light Mountain. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I will continue buying Light Mountain. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>This product is a royal mess to use, but my hair color comes out wonderful and shiny.</li>
      <li>My suggestion, is a tarp is a must, a helper would be excellent, and a few tools could be beneficial.  </li>
      <li>Mix into a smooth paste - not too thin.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
      <li>Fortunately the color was washed off after two shampoos.</li>
      <li>and I decided to buy Light Mountain</li>
      <li>Henna coloring is toxin free</li>
      <li>It may be because my hair was dyed a light brown that it didn&#x27;t go darker…</li>
      <li>Really good ingredients and exciting to have a truly natural product.  </li>
      <li>Finding the right texture to get it on your hair to spread evenly and it remain on your hair will take some experience!  </li>
      <li>A beautiful dark brown w/ caramel highlights</li>
      <li>but I rinsed it out quickly.</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;ve used the product 2 more times since my initial review and have found a process that works for me with satisfying results.&lt;br</li>

      <li>/&gt;I am satisfied with the results and I will use this again to cover new growth.  </li>
      <li>I found the light mountain dark brown henna and thought it would be a good time to give it a try.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s worth your time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>, I believe it is worth it.</li>
      <li>And I love that its all natural and never animal tested.</li>
      <li>and I loved it very much, I have dark brown hair with a lot of gray hair.</li>
      <li>and hopefully I will report back with more success.  </li>
      <li>This product is still mostly henna and applies the same way but is a good match for my dark brown hair.</li>
      <li>then once more after 2 weeks in between the next cut (but in doesn&#x27;t work as well as right after the cut).</li>
      <li>you are given a bag of powder to mix with hot water and no metal is to come into contact with the product.  </li>
      <li>After rinsing for 15 minutes I used a tiny bit of shampoo which helped remove most of it out.  </li>
      <li>First off, the smell.  </li>
      <li>it really freak me out!</li>
      <li>My hair came out looking exactly as I wanted it to.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking into this product I am sure you are already aware of the chemicals in regular hair dyes.  </li>
      <li>I tried this product for the first time yesterday.  </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s because this product bled for the first week.  </li>
      <li>but this Light mountain natural works ..</li>
      <li>My gray hairs have also turned more to a medium brown color with a hint of red.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully the product didn&#x27;t stain my skin on my face and what got on my neck came off pretty well.  </li>
      <li>A day later my hair is much darker and more brown.  </li>
      <li>Overall pretty easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This darkened my hair and covered most of the grey hair.  </li>
      <li>I admit I didn&#x27;t use distilled water, but the water in our town comes straight off the glaciers and is pretty</li>
      <li>but since dyeing my hair was one of the last things I do that involved commercial, chemical driven products I really wanted this product to be good.</li>
      <li>My hair is super soft, has volume, and it does smell.  </li>
      <li>large ziploc &amp; let sit for 3 hours.</li>
      <li>but it certainly doesn&#x27;t make your hair softer and the instructions say to use baking soda or conditioner after rinsing.  </li>
      <li>Well there isn&#x27;t much to choose from in the realm of organic hair dye.  </li>
      <li>In the end my hair turned out a light brown with tons of red in it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t mind it much at all.</li>
      <li>but my hair doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as much as the day I put the paste in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.  </li>
      <li>VERY MISLEADING.</li>
      <li>I purchased Light Mountain last year</li>
      <li>Absolutely not!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Next you notice a loose leaf tobacco scent that only gets more potent.  </li>
      <li>It was different from the dyes I have used previously, but it was actually kind of fun.</li>
      <li>If you have gray hair, you have to use light mountains COLOR THE GREY line.  </li>
      <li>But after I shampooed, it did turn a lovely dark brown that lasted quite a while.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After reading about the dangers of chemical hair dyes and realizing that some of the cancers that are attached to those chemicals have run in my family, I decided to not risk my health when it was unnecessary. I began researching natural alternatives to dying my hair dark and kept running into henna. I was very,very,very apprehensive about using the henna. Since my hair as a tendency to turn bronze with other hair dyes (since it has a naturally red tint) I was terrified that my hair would come out red. I found the light mountain dark brown henna and thought it would be a good time to give it a try. I did a lot of research about using henna and learned a few tricks. I did add coffee and egg to mine to keep the darker tones and for the moisturizing benefits the egg offers. I followed the instructions that came with the box and let it cure for 3 hrs. I did start to do a strand test and just got impatient and went for it anyway. I left the henna on for 3 hours and didn&#x27;t use heat since I read that could increase the red tones in your hair. My hair came out a beautiful rich brown and feels very soft. I love it! The only negatives about the henna (but they are worth it) are that you are left with the henna smell, it is time consuming if you do it properly, and it takes a bit of work to get out of your hair. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to chemical dyes. Trust me, it&#x27;s worth your time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m half black and half Korean.  My hair is just past my shoulders and is naturally wavy/curly.  My hair color is dark brown.  About two weeks ago I had used a box hair dye to cover my grays.  The box dye left my hair a little drier and didn&#x27;t cover any of my gray hairs.  I didn&#x27;t want to wait another 6 to 8 weeks to dye my hair again so I did some research and stumbled upon henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product at my local Vitamin Cottage and decided to try it out.  On Sunday before running errands I made the henna paste with warm distilled water and lime juice (I didn&#x27;t have lemon juice).  I made my paste the consistency of yogurt.  I left the paste to sit on the kitchen counter covered with plastic wrap.  I was gone for 4 hours and when I came back I found my paste had turned green to brown green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a teaspoon of lavender essential oil to cover up the stale cigarette smell before applying the paste to my hair.  I also covered my hairline, ears, and back of my neck with Vaseline (prevents staining).  I applied the paste outside on my deck as I was worried the paste would drip all over the place.  I didn&#x27;t find this to be messy at all.  It took about 20 minutes to apply the paste on my hair.  Once I was done I put a plastic shower cap on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the paste on my hair for 2 hours.  Rinsing the paste off took a while.  After rinsing for 15 minutes I used a tiny bit of shampoo which helped remove most of it out.  The conditioner helped get rid of the rest of the henna grit from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The immediate results was reddish brown hair.  My gray strands were a copper red color.  A day later my hair is much darker and more brown.  My gray hairs have also turned more to a medium brown color with a hint of red.  My hair is super soft, has volume, and it does smell.  My hair doesn&#x27;t smell as bad dry as it does wet but my hair doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as much as the day I put the paste in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the results and I will use this again to cover new growth.  I think next week I will use this product again and keep it in for 4 hours in hopes to get my gray hairs a bit darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update: I&#x27;ve used the product 2 more times since my initial review and have found a process that works for me with satisfying results.&lt;br /&gt;-I mix the henna in distilled water and use it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;-I apply a thick layer to many small sections.  On each section I place a thick layer on both sides and massage with my  finger tips to make sure the product is completely covering my hair.&lt;br /&gt;-I let the henna stay in my hair overnight.  I find using plastic food wrap works much better than a shower cap or the cap that comes with the product.  The wrap also helps contain some of the smell from the product.&lt;br /&gt;-I place a towel over my pillow to prevent accidental staining, however I never had any issues with leakage.&lt;br /&gt;-The next morning I rinse my hair out with conditioner.

    <li> Excellent product and alternative to chemical processing.  I have dark dark brown hair. I have tried regular henna before but it made my hair very red. This product is still mostly henna and applies the same way but is a good match for my dark brown hair. Definitely let the product sit for 3 hours after mixing and I definitely leave it on for an hour. It is great!! And I love that its all natural and never animal tested. Imagine the chemicals from regular hair dyes being put on little helpless rabbits and feel good that you no longer support such torture.    Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I used this on my husbands hair last night. He has dark brown hair with a smattering of grey on his head and his beard.  We followed the mixing and application and removal directions to the letter, and now all his grey hair has turned a lovely shade of blue!  We went to sleep hoping it would mellow out by morning.  Nope, I still awoke next to Blue Beard.  I will be sending this to the manufacturer for my money back.</li>
    <li> Alright, so i used to want dark hair so i ordered this product out of haste.  Well, i followed the directions and ended up using 2 packets since the first one washed out really red.  In the end my hair turned out a light brown with tons of red in it. Not exactly what i wanted.  Im a natural blonde, and from now on im going to stay that way, because this red takes a longgggg time to get out of your hair.  Its not worth it.  If you need it to cover gray hair and you want brown hair with red tones in it, be my guest.  But i hate red and was not happy with the red results.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased and used this product.  I can honestly say that I never intend on using it again.  I do like the color it produced, yet within a few days it began to fade.  I do like that there are no harsh chemicals and that it is \\&quot;natural.\\&quot;  When you open the box you are given a bag of powder to mix with hot water and no metal is to come into contact with the product.  Then as you mix the product with water a greenish hued substance is produced.  It looks unappealing but I forged ahead.  Next you notice a loose leaf tobacco scent that only gets more potent.  Then you begin application.  The mixture has small particles similar to sand.  I found the application messy and difficult to cover all of  my hair.  Then you wait and try to rinse all of the \\&quot;sand\\&quot; out of your hair.  Good luck!  Finally you have your final color and SMELL!  I could not get past the smell, it was awful.  Since I bought a pack of 3 I now have 2 boxes of hair color with no intentions of using it again.  Plus the box says conditioner...not sure what they exactly mean by that but it certainly doesn&#x27;t make your hair softer and the instructions say to use baking soda or conditioner after rinsing.  Sadly disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Even after reading the mixed reviews I decided to give this a try and bought it from the local health food store. I have previously only used store bought Revlon/Feria products but since dyeing my hair was one of the last things I do that involved commercial, chemical driven products I really wanted this product to be good. My hair is pretty long, naturally medium to dark brown so I was looking to condition it as well as color the strands that had lightened up in the sun which is why I bought this shade-so as not to have anything dramatic. One thing I was worried about was my hair turning out just one shade of very dark brown-which I wanted to avoid because I like having varying shades; was also a little concerned about it turning green based on others experience. I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; but added clove powder, amla powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and a touch of ginger in hopes that it would help not only with smell but achieve those various shades I was looking for. I let the mixture cure for about 30 minutes and after putting it on my hair I kept it on for about 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks awesome-no green, smells good, shiny... exact results that I was hoping for without harsh chemicals. I will never go back to the other brands again. When washing the henna mixture out it was pretty gritty so next time I do it I will probably add an egg or yogurt ahead of time to hopefully alleviate that-I used conditioner to wash out the grit. As far as smell goes, other customers complained of how awful it smells-I am not sure if it&#x27;s because I used herbs or because I don&#x27;t mind natural smells, I found the smell to be pleasant even though it did remind of working in a horse or cow barn. I prefer those smells to toxic perfumes, environmental toxins or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a good experience, I hope others will give the henna a try. I wish I had started doing this a long time ago!</li>
    <li> This is the best henna Ive ever used!!!!!</li>
    <li> Really good ingredients and exciting to have a truly natural product.  When compared to commercial preparations, this is labor intensive, has an objectionable scent (to some folks) and is messy.  Having said all that, I believe it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I thought it would be. Very gritty , hard to mix up , and my hair had a green tint. Not Happy with product</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t turn my hair to green or brown but unnatural ugly uneven red. Fortunately the color was washed off after two shampoos. But after all the hassles keeping the mud on my head for hours, I hope the product can perform better.</li>
    <li> 1) My nursing background always has me erring to the side of avoiding potential carcinogens or mutagens. There has been plenty of research linking chemicals present in most commercial hair dyes to cancer in animals, etc. I would rather avoid potential carcinogens, because its simply not worth the possible risks as far as I&#x27;m concerned.    2) Henna does not dry out, damage, thin, remove, or otherwise insult hair, skin, or follicles. It is unlikely to one day trigger an allergic response. Another reason to avoid the harsher commercial dyes.     3) commenters said to mix the mixture in a freezer bag/ large ziploc &amp; let sit for 3 hours. Apply. Wrap with saran wrap and an old shirt or towel and sit with it for 1-5 hours. This is not unreasonable if one is willing to invest a little more time and planning to avoid the harsh dyes. It could also be done outdoors to avoid mess.     4) I&#x27;m going to give it a try, and then update later.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed!! A long tedious &amp; very messy process taking ten times longer than my usual hair coloring products and IT DID NOT WORK! Uggh!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT IT CAUSE I WANTED NATURAL HAIR COLOR BUT ID RATHER NOT DIE MY HAIR AT ALL THAN USE THIS STUFF,.. ALSO ITS JUST THE COLOR... NO CONDITIONER IN ANY OF THE BOXES. VERY MISLEADING.</li>
    <li> received the wrong color when it came, but i tried it anyways and love it just as much. i used to buy this product at a local health food store &amp; plan to order again. it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love henna, and love this brand. Starting to get gray hair sadly, and this shade is really close to my natural color, but doesn&#x27;t completely color my grays (which is what I want, since I don&#x27;t like to have mono-tone hair). Like that it gives my hair dimension, shine, and protection and is all natural. Sure it&#x27;s a little more work, but chemical hair dyes smell terrible, wreck your hair, give me a headache, and suck in general especially when you get harsh undyed chunks here and there. Henna all the way :)</li>
    <li> But ancient secrets if you want good quality henna, can not get it on Amazon,  but search the web for it.</li>
    <li> I decided to try henna hair dye after I severly damaged my hair over a year ago and had to cut it. I wanted to try a dye that would be good for my hair and wasn&#x27;t tested on animals (which I love about this stuff). It was different from the dyes I have used previously, but it was actually kind of fun. It smelled like cut grass, green tea, and dirt. I didn&#x27;t mind it much at all. The only downside was trying to wash it out without shampoo. It left particles on my scalp, and I was so grateful to shampoo my hair after the 24 hours were up. I love the color though. It came out beautifully and very shiny and healthy looking. I will definitely continue to use henna hair dye. I might even try to shake things up by mixing colors like they suggest on their website. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to take a break from the chemical dyes or just try something new. It&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This product is a royal mess to use, but my hair color comes out wonderful and shiny. All that without chemicals and such a deal on price!!! I&#x27;ve tried many of the so called healthy hair dye and this is the best. It was shipped quickly and carefully.</li>
    <li> I purchased Light Mountain last year and I loved it very much, I have dark brown hair with a lot of gray hair. I bought this product for different reasons first when I started to color my hair I would go to my local drug store and buy hair coloring kit and I really didn&#x27;t like it because of the chemical smell and plus something horrible happen to me the left side of my face and my left arm went numb it really freak me out! I didn&#x27;t want to go to the ER I was too embarassed I should have gone but I didn&#x27;t I just washed it off quickly. I decided I would never dye my hair again. But then as the years pass the gray hair would appear more and more and it bugged me a lot so I decided to do some research and I came here and saw the reviews and I decided to buy Light Mountain I bought it in Dark Brown I follow the instructions. Boil water in a glass pot on the stove mixed it in plastic container I added an egg, lemon juice and a Tbsp of cinnamon and let it sit for a few hours. Then put some newspapers on my bathroom floor and proceeded to apply the mixture on my hair and it was tough for me to tell u the truth and it was gritty, has a weird smell too. Then I put on a shower cap and let it do it&#x27;s work for about 3 to 4 hours. My head felt pretty heavy so I had to sit down on a chair and lean back on the wall but I went outside. And then when time was up I started to wash it off it took like 30 minutes and I had to use some conditioner to make it easier to rinse it off. Blow dry my hair and the results were pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;I really loved it! The next few days my hair was dark brown but with copper highlights from where I have gray hair it looked awesome!!! Now the thing you have to be careful is try not getting it into your eyes because it hurts, it happen to me but I rinsed it out quickly. Have a lot newspapers on the floor cause it could get pretty messy. Always use gloves. I didn&#x27;t apply any vaseline on the hairline or on the back of my neck I forgot to do that and I thought I was going to have my skin dyed with the mixture but it didn&#x27;t. &#x3D;)I will continue buying Light Mountain. &#x3D;)ught I was going to have my skin dyed with the mixture but it didn&#x27;t. &#x3D;)I will continue buying Light Mountain. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I used this product and didn&#x27;t see any results. I was excited that there was an all natural hair colouring product but was very disappointed with the results. I followed the instructions word by word and didn;t see any difference, for a few days my hair looked slightly green. It may be because my hair was dyed a light brown that it didn&#x27;t go darker…This product brings 3 boxes, I still have one sitting in my bathroom. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I hate reading long reviews as much as the next person, I&#x27;ll try to keep it brief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind: I have waist length, fairly thick hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Hair Color: Chemical Treated. medium-light brown (many varying shades) w/ blonde highlights&lt;br /&gt;After Hair Color: A beautiful dark brown w/ caramel highlights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calls For: 12-16oz distilled water, but comes with suggestions of other additives to create certain color hues&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liquid Additives added: 1/2 lemon juice (instead of some water), and steeped 2 bags of honey vanilla chamomile tea in it for the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Dried Additives: Ginger, Cloves, Nutmeg, and Cinnamon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let it sit for about 30-45 min before using and let it stay in my hair for about 2 hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting it out: Most of it came out by just letting the shower head run over my hair for a while. After that I used a little bit of baking soda. Then, a scalp brush to get the rest of it off. Overall pretty easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue playing with different things to add each time I dye it and I&#x27;ll probably update when I do!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but felt this was necessary. I am a 52 year old male with short hair. I have been allergic to hair dye forever...even went to the doctor 3 times and he said one more time and I could stop breathing. I finally found this stuff so I thought an explanation was needed on how to use, as I have done some things wrong and boy, was I sorry! First, it always works best right after a haircut. I usually do immediately after a monthly cut and then once more after 2 weeks in between the next cut (but in doesn&#x27;t work as well as right after the cut). Here is my method:&lt;br /&gt;1. Microwave a cup or so of water for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;2. Put some dye powder in a cereal type bowl. Mine is ceramic.&lt;br /&gt;3. Slowly add in the water and mix with a flat, semi firm, hair dye brush(my wife had one and it works awesome.)&lt;br /&gt;4. Mix into a smooth paste - not too thin.&lt;br /&gt;5. Wet your hair with warm/hot water until damp.&lt;br /&gt;6. Brush the dye on your head, front to back, until really wet and green. you should look like the Riddler :)&lt;br /&gt;7. Place the bag, or I use a shopping bag, on your head. You can smooth it down if you like.&lt;br /&gt;8. Run a hairdryer over it for about a minute to heat up the head.&lt;br /&gt;9. I then only wait about 15 minutes. remove bag.&lt;br /&gt;10. Go in the shower and rinse off. You can leave it like that, but I shampoo my hair. I use a thickening shampoo and I wonder if that seals it in?&lt;br /&gt;11. It will be a little green, so do on a Friday night or Saturday. Don&#x27;t be discouraged as it gets much darker the next day. The first few times it will be greener because the grey isn&#x27;t used to it, but I have used for years and its barely showing green anymore. This seems to also thicken my hair.....I also do my eyebrows every third time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it. I hoped I helped someone! Please let me know if I did. Good luck and I hope it works for you as it did for me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. Works well as a conditioner and color actually lasts longer than packaging indicates. This is the only product I used for 6 years to date. It is a plant, safe for your health and it will not cause cancer, as it has no chemical additives. You don&#x27;t have to add anything but water. I am pretty much of a health freak, and try to stay away from chemicals and pharmaceuticals as much as possible.</li>
    <li> Very nice..I have I have allergy on deffirent brand but this Light mountain natural works ..I love it..</li>
    <li> I have been using Henna for a long time. this is basically the same thing . but with natural henna you don&#x27;t see color running out every time you wash your hair. With this I feel like it has a dye , if I rub my neck with a tissue i can see th coIor on it as well. even my pillow covers are a little brown now. but saying all that I have to say the product is good on Hairs if it stays on Hairs. :-)</li>
    <li> This product did a great job coloring my hair and I&#x27;ll use it again. Do a little research about any henna dying and you&#x27;ll know ahead of time that it&#x27;s smellier and messier than using a typical box dye. However, you&#x27;ll also find out how many cancer-causing chemicals are used in typical box dyes. Henna coloring is toxin free so, yes, I will deal with a little odor and mess (do it in the shower, no big deal) when my health in concerned.</li>
    <li> I buy mine at a store and just came on here for reviews.  I tried this product for the first time yesterday.  I initially got the above pictured box and thankfully called customer service because having some grey hair, I am not supposed to use the regular light mountain.  If you have gray hair, you have to use light mountains COLOR THE GREY line.  If you cannot find color the grey then buy the red henna (has a picture of a Fox on it) and then also buy the color you desire.  First apply the red henna for 15 min to roots where gray hair is or all over if you have gray hair all the way down your length.  Then just rinse and apply henna of the color you want and leave on the necessary time.  This way your gray hair will get a red tint and that will allow it to grasp the next color you put on it.  If you have grays and you only use regular light mountain, which is one application, then your Gray&#x27;s will either turn blue or green.  You HAVE to use red first on your grays and then the color You want,  if you have gray hair or blonde hair that you are trying to dye dark.  In other words, it&#x27;s a two step process for people with gray hair or blonde hair who are going dark.  Hope this helps those that ended up with green or blue hair who were either gray or trying to go dark from blonde.</li>
    <li> Okay- where to start with this product!  I bought this because I refuse to use anything other than an organic product to dye my hair.  If you are looking into this product I am sure you are already aware of the chemicals in regular hair dyes.  Is this easy to use like other chemical non-organic hair dye?  Absolutely not!!!&lt;br /&gt;  I followed the directions and made sure to not use any metal that would contaminate the color outcome.  My hair came out looking exactly as I wanted it to.  I have medium brown hair with quite a few greys.  This darkened my hair and covered most of the grey hair.  It didn&#x27;t cover all of it, but I think that was more my fault in not spreading it on all my hair appropriately.&lt;br /&gt;  So yes the product works great, and I will continue to use it.  However, lets address the MAJOR ISSUES!!&lt;br /&gt;  First off, the smell.  It smells like manure, spinach and very old pot.  It is horrible!  The smell did not go away for several days too.  So, that&#x27;s kinda gross.  I have read other reviewers talk about adding spices and teas (instead of just plain water.)  I plan on trying anything and everything next time to see if I can reduce or eliminate the smell.&lt;br /&gt;  Secondly, you must be prepared for an epic mess.  This is either too runny or too goopy.  Finding the right texture to get it on your hair to spread evenly and it remain on your hair will take some experience!  I have also read of other people using thickeners.  I didn&#x27;t try that and I might next time.  I used a bowl and my hands (with about 10 pairs of plastic gloves.)  I was in no way prepared for the mess that this created!  My suggestion, is a tarp is a must, a helper would be excellent, and a few tools could be beneficial.  I had no shirt on and no tarp and I got this stuff everywhere!  I screamed for my husband to help clean up the mess about 10 times so that it wouldn&#x27;t stain my counters or floors.  It did stain my bra- but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.  Without his help, it would have been really bad!  So for my next encounter I plan on having an old shirt on along with a hairdresser cape, a tarp draped everywhere that this stuff could possibly get, a hair dye bottle, combs, and hair dye brushes.  I am hoping next time to tame the mess.  I had separated my hair in about 10 sections and did each section and put my hair back in mini buns using all plastic clips.  Then I put on a shower cap.  The separated hair and shower cap worked last time and I will do the same next time.&lt;br /&gt;  Thankfully the product didn&#x27;t stain my skin on my face and what got on my neck came off pretty well.  (Okay maybe not the well, but that&#x27;s because this product bled for the first week.  Again, I&#x27;m going to try something different next time.  Normally I use organic shampoo and vinegar for conditioner.  This product might require non-organic products to try to remove it.  I think I might try a different product to try and get this stuff out of my hair!  Every time I washed my hair it bled blue and dyed my neck blue.  Not a true problem for me since I wore my hair down every day and never pulled it up (at least in public.)  But it would be nice to not have a neck stain!  The product at least did not get on my clothes, pillowcases, etc, so no true harm done.&lt;br /&gt;  So why use this product?  Well there isn&#x27;t much to choose from in the realm of organic hair dye.  I won&#x27;t use chemical hair dye so it is either have grey hair or use this product.  I am 31 and feeling kinda vain about the grey hair issue.  So for me it is worth the hassle, but as I said I have plans for the next round and hopefully I will report back with more success.  I used it about a month and a half ago and it still looks fantastic.  So I don&#x27;t expect to have to redo my hair for another month or so.&lt;br /&gt;  Should you try this product?  That is entirely up to you.  This was my experience- good luck!!!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, I was alarmed and amused that my hair came out green, despite the fact that I used a plastic bowl and spoon.  I admit I didn&#x27;t use distilled water, but the water in our town comes straight off the glaciers and is pretty pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re not supposed to shampoo for 24 hours, just rinse with conditioner.  So it was green for a day.  But after I shampooed, it did turn a lovely dark brown that lasted quite a while.  I like the fact that it fades out, so that I don&#x27;t get that funny skunk-stripe as the hair grows out from the part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side benefit was that I was motivated to go back and re-read Anne of Green Gables.  In the story, Anne is trying to dye her hair dark brown and it comes out green, and my experience reminded me of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, now when I use it, I just make sure to do it on a weekend so that it will be brown before I go to work.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this brand, and I am not impressed:  my grey roots are now greenish-grey.  (Directions were followed carefully: no metal utensils, etc.  I&#x27;m hoping the color will turn brown after a day or two (as happened with another poster.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not planning to buy this brand again... I&#x27;ll stick with the henna-king brand I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
