      <li>I love this product!</li>

      <li>The serum is silky and absorbs nicely.  </li>

      <li>but it&#x27;s my own fault for not checking the ingredients, so I gave it to a friend.</li>
      <li>The wrinkle repair is up for debate, but still a nice serum to use for the price</li>
      <li>It does make my skin feel nice when I use it though</li>
      <li>SO I CANNOT GIVE AN HONEST COMMENT.</li>
      <li>Wife liked it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t even liked a cream since (the now discontinued) Line Eraser by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
      <li>At any rate, it was nice to try.</li>
      <li>nice weight and texture.  </li>
      <li>Product producing effective results</li>
      <li>Good, like the daytime product better, has sunscreen.</li>
      <li>and you are wondering how to keep your skin nice, I say, go for the retinol.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum works great and for a very economical cost.</li>
      <li>I am 66 with good skin and a couple of wrinkles beneath my eye, it really really works!!!!</li>
      <li>She has not complained so if mama&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>It has a nice clean smell and hydrates the skin very nicely without leaving you with that shiny, greasy look.</li>
      <li>gene&#x27;s,after seeing many commercials and knowing Neutrogena puts out mainly great products like their Light Sesame Body oil,I decided to try the Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum,</li>
      <li>Not a face lift for sure, some improvement, but not any more noted than if using a good moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>By the way, it arrived quickly (it IS rapid, after all!), and in good condition.</li>
      <li>Very good product and much cheaper here on amazon than at walmart.</li>
      <li>This serum smells good, smooths on quickly and disappears quickly, is in an ingenious tube with applicator, and works!</li>
      <li>Very happy with this so far.</li>
      <li>Make sure you purchase the kind with the Serum..</li>
      <li>It also has a mild pleasant fragrance.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pleasant and fades quickly.</li>
      <li>I noticed an immediate reduction in the redness of my acne spots the first time I used it, and it continues to have that effect, which is great.</li>
      <li>It does have a very light scent</li>
      <li>serum feels like a very light weight moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I used it at 3:00 and kept kind of putting some on through out the night then washed my face put it on where ever there is any sort of fine lines</li>
      <li>The lotion has a smooth and rich feeling and a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this</li>
      <li>normally i love all neutogena products if they do what they say they are supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Love to use this under my moisturizer.</li>
      <li>so I make sure I use a moisturizer on top of the serum.  </li>
      <li>I use it with the daily morning and evening lotions and it works great!</li>
      <li>I had to try and squeeze more out,</li>
      <li>I love everything Neutrogena, so I may be biased.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product because its great reviews and I can confirm that it really works.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this serum.</li>
      <li>This serum is great for acne issues, but doesn&#x27;t do much for me in terms of anti-aging.</li>
      <li>My skin is smoother, and the tone is more even.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love Neutrogena products.  This In combination with Neutrogena Healthy Skin face lotion makes skin feel smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have pretty deep forehead wrinkles from a lifetime of sarcasm. This product claims to work for 100% of women who tried it immediately (seriously--what a claim!). It definitely DID reduce the appearance of deeper wrinkles (I don&#x27;t have many fine lines--not quite there yet!) within minutes. It doesn&#x27;t do much if anything for other skin ailments, such as mottled or uneven tone. It simply addresses wrinkles. This product DOES have retinol in it, which means you must wear sunscreen or risk extra sun exposure/sunburn. It also means (and it warns of this on the box) that your skin may begin to peel after extended use. This definitely happened to me after about 5-7 days of using it every morning. I just stopped using it every day and the peeling subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend putting this on right when you wake up, so that by the time you&#x27;re ready to apply your makeup, it is dried and working. I also wear sunscreen under my foundation (I know, a lot of stuff to slather on), so this can create a lot of wait time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  My hair dresser thought I was going to be 35 on my birthday and I am turnimg 50!  I highly recommend this product as it has made my skin look so young and beautiful.  I constantly receive compliments on my skin and I always tell them that it&#x27;s Neutrogena!  What would I do without this product?</li>
    <li> Burned for the first few weeks I used it and made all my skin peel off.  According to the directions and reviews this is normal.  Thus far I have not seen a big difference except I have clearer skin.  We&#x27;ll see how it does long term.  Jury is still out on this product</li>
    <li> Great Moisturizer!!! Helps get rid of fine wrinkles!!!</li>
    <li> So I decided to give this product a try to see if it could remove of the laugher lines on my face I&#x27;ve begun to see. The hope was that I&#x27;d see some sort of result given how the product has such raving reviews. Unfortunately aside from the nice smell I acquired by using the product I noticed no other results. I&#x27;ll keep using it for the time being but it I&#x27;m not really sure if this product lives up to its claims to remove wrinkles. One positive thing about the product though is I have some very sensitive skin (hair gel sometimes causes rashes) and usage of this product has not led to any red patches or skin irritation on my face. So at least it&#x27;s not doing any harm even if I don&#x27;t see results (yet?).</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any particular anti-wrinkle properties about this product, but it is a nice moisturizer for dry areas.  It is not greasy and goes right in without interfering with makeup application.  It does not have a strong scent, as many products do.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for 9 days and counting as I havent seen any results whatsoever yet! Will finish the tube because I&#x27;m too cheap to throw it away but it really is not working at all!</li>
    <li> Can not live without it!  Best Facial cream you will ever find or need.  Make sure you purchase the kind with the Serum..</li>
    <li> Product was good, packaging was one of the worst I have ever seen.  Pearl-sized drop recommended which was great for twice a day use.  When I thought that I had reached the end of the tube (it has a pump type system) I had to try and squeeze more out, like I have to do with a toothpaste tube.  That worked for a little bit longer.  When I couldn&#x27;t get anymore out that way, I decided to try one more thing...just to see what was left in that tube!  I cut off the flat end and low and behold the inside was loaded with product and the feeder tube for the pump mechanism extended about 3/4 of an inch into the tube!  There was enough serum left in there for at least 2 weeks of Pearl-sized drops of serum.  Neutrogena  you should be ashamed of this packaging!!!</li>
    <li> Been using for years! Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Love it because it&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quick!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Takes too long to see a change in age spots.</li>
    <li> I like this serum, I haven&#x27;t noticed any differences yet, but I do like the feel on my skin.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum leaves skin feeling so good.  It seems to minimize wrinkles.  I have noticed a difference in my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy like some serums do.  A little bit of the serum, about the size of a pencil eraser, is enough to cover your face.  You can use the serum under your foundation and it doesn&#x27;t slide off as it absorbs very well. I really like the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum and will use it from now on.</li>
    <li> Ok for the winter, but not thrilled with it</li>
    <li> love love love. feels great, seems to work.</li>
    <li> This review is for Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum, 1 Ounce. For what it is, this product is satisfactory. Is it going to work miracles? No. However, what it will do is to moisturize your skin, giving it a more full, supple appearance. It contains both retinol (i.e. Vitamin A) and glycerin which work together to lessen signs of aging, moisturize, and restore smoothness of skin. The texture and scent are pleasing, with no greasiness or strong perfume odor.</li>
    <li> I am sad to report that after four weeks of exact use per the package&#x27;s directions, I have seen absolutely no improvement whatsoever on the fine lines above my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to using this product, I was cleansing twice daily (of course), and was exfoliating twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. Nothing.</li>
    <li> It worked a lot better than I thought it would,made my skin soft and silky also. will highly recommend this product to all.There are so many different products on the market that you don&#x27;t know which one works the best,and I have tried them all!Neutrogena skin softening lotions are also phenomemanel!After one use of the rapid wrinkle repair serum I saw and felt a difference. I am a firm believer in never recommending a product of any type unless I absolutely believe in it and love it.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s and I have two frown lines between my eyebrows. Bet that tells you a bit about my life huh? Anyway -- I had used an Avon product for quite a long time (before they discontinued it) that helped to smooth that area and make those lines less noticeable. It doesn&#x27;t remove them or anything - just helped to lessen the redness and make them a bit less prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream does the same thing exactly. It makes the redness less (no idea why it&#x27;s red there..what gives with that? LOL) and it does sort of make them less, well, bold. I did try it around my eyes where I have a few smaller wrinkles and it did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really care too much about wrinkles. I&#x27;m getting older. It is what it is. I am very happy though that this cream does seem to make the two big ones I have seem less noticeable. I did not have any issues with redness, peeling, or irritation which is why this gets 4 stars. I have horrendously sensitive skin. Nearly every skin cream I try makes me break out. This one did not. Bravo!</li>
    <li> While I love the fragrance and feel of this cream I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks and I can&#x27;t quite agree that I&#x27;ve had any Rapid Wrinkle Repair take place, I have noticed a few of my fine lines/wrinkles around my eyes seem to have been slightly diminished.  I really want to *LOVE* this and see some concrete results - especially with this price point.  In the beginning I did notice a bit of a \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; feeling after applying it but that has gone away since.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it and perhaps purchase more.</li>
    <li> Yes this did make my skin feel softer but made no difference with wrinkles and blemishes. It was very expensive for what it do do.</li>
    <li> In spite of the claims made by the makers of this product, unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t proven to be as good as expected. After over 2 weeks of use, the product seems like all of the other products of this type, long on claims, short on actual skin improvements. Indeed, the skin of the nose was constantly drying out with the use of this product. At the end of the time period used, the skin on the chin was also breaking out. I don&#x27;t know for sure that the product caused or exacerbated the acne problem on the chin, but thought I should mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a \\&quot;horrible\\&quot; product, but certainly didn&#x27;t work as well here as was hoped and expected, so it is no longer being used, even though there is still plenty of the product left.  It isn&#x27;t something that I&#x27;d recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other similar products that we have tried.</li>
    <li> works okay but dries skin</li>
    <li> In the first place I did not intend to order this item!  Had just rec&#x27;d my new Kindle (which arrived without any instructions) &amp; was attempting to figure the thing out when I accidently swiped an order for this item.  Immediately I clicked &amp;#34;cancel order&amp;#34; &amp;#34;ordered by mistake&amp;#34; but guess that either did not go thru or was ignored because in my inbox I rec&#x27;d a message stating that &amp;#34;2 minutes ago&amp;#34; this item had been ordered and was being shipped.  I sure did not get that fast a service on the Kindle.  Tried to send back a message stating that this had been cancelled, but of course that message was bounced back to me.  I decided not to fight it as it was an inexpensive item - just happy I did not mistakenly order an expensive item!</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this but for some reason, it made my skin peel.  Gave it to my daughter who hasn&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
    <li> To be fair, I have to say that I didnt use it for a month, so I cant say whether or not the product efficiently addresses the wrinkle/line issue. This product is for *normal* or oily skin---funnily, part of the skin&#x27;s aging issue is the drying of the skin which contributes to the wrinkling process. I have had dry skin my whole life(no wrinkles yet hallelujah) but I dont see how this product could be really effective in fighting against the aging process for people with dry skin. It might have a nice ingredient or 2 thats good for smoothing out lines. It may have made the skin appear a tad tighter than before i put it on, but  without anything in this product for dry skin, I think I looked kind of sick when I used this product---tight skin but pale, dry and make some redness due to the mild irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont think this product will last long in the market</li>
    <li> I have my doubts about any wrinkle creams. But I received the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum from Amazon Vine, so I decided to try it out on my fine lines. After weeks of use though, there were no noticeable results. To be fair, I have no wrinkles yet but it claims to work on fine lines as well. Another negative for me was the awful pump design. Trying to push down the metallic pump was difficult, as you have to get it at just the right angle for it to go down. Which, by then, means your pushing hard and can accidentally squeeze too much out of it and make a mess. I like the Neutrogena brand for lotions, but this product didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> I was going to finish the entire tube of this serum before I wrote a review, but I&#x27;m so impressed with the results that I felt compelled to share my thoughts right away.  I&#x27;m 37 years old and I have some laugh lines around my eyes and a couple of deep creases on my forehead due to foolish sun exposure in my younger years. I didn&#x27;t  have high expectations for this product because I&#x27;m always disappointed by the MANY eye creams that I continue to try. I haven&#x27;t even liked a cream since (the now discontinued) Line Eraser by L&#x27;Oreal. However, after only 3 weeks of using this everyday, I have noticed a big difference around my eyes. While the lines are not completely gone, they are much softer and less noticeable. I do have very sensitive skin and during the first week of use, I did experience some tingling by my eyes, but it stopped after the first week. I&#x27;m so impressed and pleased with this cream and I&#x27;m very excited to see the results after longterm use. I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I think I know what all the other words mean and stand for but I&#x27;m not sure what the \\&quot;SA\\&quot; stands for.  This serum promises to greatly decrease the amount of time it takes for the user to visibly notice a fewer fine lines, wrinkles, and the like.  It postulates that products often run out before the results are noticed.  This product states that a difference will be noticed in about a week&#x27;s time.  A truly  remarkable \\&quot;promise\\&quot; since even prescription strength retinol requires use for about 4 weeks or more before its effectiveness is noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the packaging.  It&#x27;s confused.  I&#x27;m annoyed.  It doesn&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s a tube or a pump.  Its outside appears as a tube but when the cap is removed, there is a pump.  Not only does the tube and a pump make no sense to me, but I have found after two weeks of use,  the pump seems to be failing and an inconsistent amount of product is dispensed with each pump or i have to repeatedly pump in order to get enough product out for my needs.  This makes me inclined to push the tube up from the bottom( similar to what I do with my toothpaste) in order to get more product to the top.  But of course, that is not helpful since the product is not simply a squeeze tube. So, I&#x27;m left wondering if I will have to use my husband &#x27;s tools at some  point in order to break the \\&quot;pump\\&quot; to get to the rest of the product.  After two weeks of nightly use, more than 60% of the products appears to still remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have I noticed a decrease in  my fine lines ?  No.  But perhaps my overall face appears more even toned?  Possibly.  In the last two days, I have forgone any foundation (typically used only around my nose and forehead) and concealer and just used loose powder to \\&quot;even out\\&quot; my skin tone and I have to admit that my skin&#x27;s evenness seems to have improved.  There is a healthy glow ( could it have to do with my new exercise routine?)  When applied and rubbed in, the product left a chalky residue so I only used itat night.  There was an ever so slight tingly feeling on my face after the first couple of uses but the sensation disappeared quickly and was not at all problematic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would rate this product a 3/4, mainly for the overall even and glowing appearance that this product may be contributing to my skin.  Would  I purchase it?  Not sure yet.  I&#x27;m sure I will have a more definite answer by the end of the tube, or pump, or whatever it is.</li>
    <li> I am over 60 years of age and short of a life lift, I will have some wrinkles.  The serum really did help to minimize the look of my fine lines.  It is easy to use and goes on smoothly without being greasy.  I would like to have started using a product like this when I was younger.  If you can prevent the lines from starting, wow, that would be great.  This is a good cream under your sunscreen or other daily moisturizer.  It also has a mild pleasant fragrance.  I have been using it a little over two weeks and it definitely has reduced the look of my finer lines.</li>
    <li> People keep telling me I look younger!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28 but I&#x27;ve been using retinol for years due to severe acne. This is a dream product. It works just as well as the $80 cream i used to buy from the medspa, but it smells better and the best part is, it&#x27;s a serum, so i can still use it underneath the day/night cream of my choice. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find ever ingredient you want in a single product. This one is light and absorbent enough to layer, making it perfect.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product improved my wrinkles, because honestly I have been using retinol products for 20 years, and I do have nice clear skin, but at my age a few wrinkles are inevitable. I doubt I will ever find a new product that will do more than all the previous products have done. I definitely believe 20 years of retinol is the formula for good skin in middle/old age, so if you are younger than me (most people are!) and you are wondering how to keep your skin nice, I say, go for the retinol. That&#x27;s the ingredient to look for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many modern products that contain retinol, and this is a very good example of such a product. The lotion has a smooth and rich feeling and a pleasant scent. You can feel a slight tingling sensation when you put it on, which is the retinal doing its job, which is mainly exfoliating and stimulating your skin cells. Okay, I&#x27;m not a scientist and I don&#x27;t really know how it works, but I am convinced that it does work, and women are smart to look for products containing retinol.</li>
    <li> not as advertised, did not see result in a week.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It does exactly what it says it does. I have noticed a big difference in my face!</li>
    <li> I put it on my wrinkles and it is helping diminish them wherever they are on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this floral-scented retinol cream on my sensitive skin for almost 2 weeks. While I&#x27;m delighted that I don&#x27;t have a reaction to this form of Retinol, I&#x27;m only starting to see improvement in my wrinkles in the last couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s working nicely and I&#x27;m happy with the results. While it is faster than other creams I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s not as fast as their claims.</li>
    <li> Product producing effective results</li>
    <li> As instructed, have used this once a day.  Have really not seen much effect.  It is a nice, as descibed moisturizer, but cannot see much change in skin, light wrinkles, etc.  I have skin that is sensitive to products, but have had no adverse effects from this at all, so that is a good thing.  My skin is not very wrinkly to begin with, so perhaps someone with more of a problem would see more difference.  At any rate, it was nice to try.</li>
    <li> I hate to give a product I got for free through the Amazon Vine Program only one star, but I have to call it like I see it.  I&#x27;ve used this product for two weeks now and see absolutely no reduction in wrinkles.  Neutrogena advertises that this product, \\&quot;Delivers visible results in just one week. Fades the look of stubborn wrinkles, smoothes fine lines and texture,\\&quot; so I feel justified in writing a review at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a middle-aged male and don&#x27;t have a whole lot of wrinkles to begin with but enough to warrant giving this product a go.  The wrinkles around my eyes are pretty fine and are mostly only noticeable when I smile.  I would think that those lines would have been the easiest for a product like this to correct.  In order to test this product out, I have only applied it to the wrinkles around one of my eyes in the time that I&#x27;ve been testing it, leaving the other eye as the &#x27;control group&#x27; (think back to your middle school science projects).  After two weeks, I see zero difference between the crow&#x27;s feet around my two eyes.  I also have some deeper wrinkles in my forehead that I have treated with this product.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any improvement there either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena recommends using a \\&quot;pearl-sized\\&quot; amount of their product, which seems to be exactly one full pump of the serum.  After rubbing it in, I feel a very slight burning in my skin.  Not enough for it to turn red, but just enough to be ever so slightly annoying.  There also seems to be a very mild degree of puffing of the skin, but that may just be the slight burning which I&#x27;m mistaking for puffing.  The directions recommend using the product less frequently if you experience skin irritation.  So far, I&#x27;ve used it just about every day, but I&#x27;m now backing off given that I&#x27;ve not seen results in the timeframe promised and don&#x27;t like the mild irritation.  I have used Liquid Neutrogena Facial Cleansing Formula for years and like it--I just can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> In all fairness I am diligent about taking care of my skin and I workout 5-6 days a week, so I can be described as a health nut.  The cream serum smells good and is not sticky so those are some of the best attributes.  Its claims of being rapid  wrinkle repairhowever, remains to be seen.  I am a firm believer that you usually need to use these external solutions in conjunction or rather secondary to internal solutions such as your diet and nutrition, which more often than not TRULY effects your skin.  I cannot overly recommend or not recommend based upon my usage.</li>
    <li> Considering my age, I really don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles ....and...may I say....it probably would be asking a lot out of this Repair Serum to erase the ones I have.  I&#x27;ve been using the Serum for about 2 weeks now and honestly may see a bit of improvement.  Seems to have smoothed the ones around my mouth somewhat.  Try it....you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> While this product does absorb quickly into the skin as it states, I have been using it for two weeks and have not noticed any difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Per the stated &#x27;100% of women had visible results instantly&#x27;. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Neutrogena so I was disappointed in the Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum.&lt;br /&gt;It claimed to fade deep wrinkles, including crows feet and forehead and cheek wrinkles. (I&#x27;ve small crows feet so was hoping foe some change to no avail, everything else remained the same.)&lt;br /&gt; My skin did not brighten nor change in texture as claimed though it did make my skin much softer, noticeably so for this reason I&#x27;ll give it four stars and also being that these products are subjective. What works or doesn&#x27;t work for me may work for another especially considering it contains Retinol SA and Hyaluronic Acic both well know for their ability to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Why no effect on me is a mystery.</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t have a lot of winkles yet, but I just didn&#x27;t notice a huge change with what I do have. I did like the texture of my skin after using it so it wasn&#x27;t all bad. I&#x27;m just not sure it is a product for me.</li>
    <li> Personally, other than having a face lift or possibly botox, I don&#x27;t believe there is any product out there on the market that could change the definition of your skin. I do believe that a product could hydrate your skin, leaving it softer and healthier looking. But there is no way that an over the counter topical serum/cream can diminish fine lines and wrinkles of any kind. I believe that people who say that it has done that for them, must see what they wanna see. Put it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I do however think it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. It has a nice clean smell and hydrates the skin very nicely without leaving you with that shiny, greasy look. It&#x27;s cheaper than the high end moisturizers, so for that maybe it&#x27;s worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good moisturizing cream, this could work for you. Other than that, meet with your plastic surgeon to get rid of the lines/wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Leaves the skin really smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> This serum is great for acne issues, but doesn&#x27;t do much for me in terms of anti-aging. I have found that it&#x27;s too strong to use around my eye area, and has caused little bumps to appear after use in that are. Now I just use it as a spot treatment if I have any trouble areas.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype. I really wanted it to work, but it didn&#x27;t. It literally would come off my face. Like I was peeling or molting!</li>
    <li> Huge fan of expensive products, after relocating and having a baby changed that a bit and this is my new favorite. The serum goes on lightly and leaves a nice smooth finish to my skin. I&#x27;ve only used it at night so cannot say how it lasts during the day. Admittedly, when I slather this on at night it&#x27;s probably wasting quite a bit of the product but at this price who cares...so far it has faded the pregnancy and sun spots that nothing worked on and wrinkles are much better.  The biggest change is just skin texture overall is softer and looks firm. Go get it.</li>
    <li> I have been using for years and seem to hold some wrinkles at bay</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 10 days. The results are amazing!  I have extremely sensitive and dry skin.  As a woman over 60, I have some wrinkles.  From the first time I used this product I saw my wrinkles were disappearing.  After about three or four days I did experience some redness on my face as well as peeling.  Since then I just put a small amount on the wrinkles and am seeing them disappear as well.  The redness and peeling are gone.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product and don&#x27;t start my day without it. It leaves my skin feeling nice and silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I need an effective but not necessarily full-strength retinol formulation for my adult acne and uneven skin tone. I have had success with other Neutrogena products in the past, and previously was using Neutrogena Healthy Skin anti-wrinkle moisturizer, but I needed something slightly stronger and less greasy--hence this one. I use this at night and really appreciate how it mattifies my skin and prevents me from waking up with a greasy face (which happens naturally if I just let my oil glands do their thing). I noticed an immediate reduction in the redness of my acne spots the first time I used it, and it continues to have that effect, which is great. It makes my skin feel very smooth and so far has not caused any irritation. My skin has peeled slightly, but nothing major. The thing I don&#x27;t appreciate is the design of the tube. I feel like I will never be able to get all the product out, which is annoying. Other than that I&#x27;m really happy with this Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum and will buy it again. One last thing is that it definitely has a fragrance. I like it, but it makes itself known.</li>
    <li> When researching eye creams I came across a top 10 list and this was the  number one listed.  So I thought heck why not?? Should have save my money. I really didn&#x27;t see any results and have stopped using it</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  It&#x27;s lightweight, pretty much odorless and noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this so far. I have been using it after cleansing my face in the morning and underneath my moisturizer. I have not experienced any of the irritation, peeling, or redness that are possible side effects, and feel like my pores have already gotten smaller. Will continue to use and I am excited to see the results!</li>
    <li> I am 29 years old and have really been bothered by fine to deep wrinkles on my my forehead. I have been using this product every other night for about a month and I love it! It leaves my skin very soft and has drastically reduced my lines. I would definitely reccomend it!</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I have MCS so I am more sensitive to fragrance than most, but I could not use this product long enough to see any benefit because it has such a strong smell!  I tried to use a tiny drop two different times and each time I had to wash it off because it had such a strong fragrance.  Even after washing my face the fragrance still lingered.  Do they realize people put this stuff on their face, near their nose?  An overpowering fragrance is a deal-breaker.  I&#x27;d have returned it but it&#x27;s my own fault for not checking the ingredients, so I gave it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I bought this months before my wedding to help with some wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice much effect, but after 3 weeks of continual use there was a noticeable difference around my eyes.  I&#x27;m still using the same tube I bought back then, usually once a day but sometimes twice or not at all.  I think people who don&#x27;t see &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; results probably are a bit too young for this product.  I will also say that I don&#x27;t think you can spot treat with it.  You really need to cover the whole area to get the full effect.  Just smearing it on top of a wrinkle won&#x27;t help as much.  I did have some mild irritation the first day I used it but it faded rapidly and hasn&#x27;t come back with repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum feels like a very light weight moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily and I can wear it under makeup with no problems.  It does have a very light scent but it&#x27;s pleasant and fades quickly.</li>
    <li> Got a free tube in a swag sample box. Been using this daily for a month. Hasn&#x27;t done anything except dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see improvement so quickly.  I am 65 and still have oily and acne-prone skin.  This product has improved my skin immensely.  It has made my skin less blotchy, clearer, poreless, and smoother.  I also have gotten compliments on how good my skin looks, which is very unusual since I&#x27;ve been plagued with bad skin since I was a teenager.  Unlike other products I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin red and dry.  I use this serum at night and was going to use the daytime version with sunscreen but didn&#x27;t want to overdo the retinol.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month or two this summer.  I&#x27;m hoping it works as well when it rains and in the winter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and starting to get some fine lines and a few deeper creases unfortunately I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in fine lines or wrinkles after using it for a couple of months. It could be because I can&#x27;t use it more than a few days a week or I break out. It does make my skin feel nice when I use it though but I bought it for the wrinkle repair component so I didn&#x27;t really get what I wanted out of the product. I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> The smell. It is SO STRONG and very very perfume floral. If you are sensitive to scent or have skin sensitive to perfumes do not use this product. Just the tiny pearl size amount require stank up my whole bathroom. I don&#x27;t understand how other reviews could possibly thing it &amp;#34;pleasant.&amp;#34; It made me sick to my stomach. I&#x27;m not sure how the product works as I can&#x27;t bare to use it.</li>
    <li> This really works. Makes my skin look younger esp around the eyes. Also its the best price that I have seen anywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is actually helping much at all. I can&#x27;t really see a difference however I will not be able to use it much longer because it has been breaking out my skin.</li>
    <li> This is my first review.  I bought this product because of a magazine review.  By night three I could tell a difference.  I am 43.  I use the serum only once a day.  I find more than that is too harsh.  If it is still too strong use it mixed with your regular lotion.  It is the only product I have found that works.</li>
    <li> it might possibly be a bit too strong for some people</li>
    <li> Not too sure if it works</li>
    <li> I am a 31 year old,who has been faithfully using this product for close to four months now. Several years ago,when I started noticing a few &amp;#34;expression&amp;#34; lines/smile creases around my eyes,I decided to take a proactive approach.I had a favorite face cream,but after that was discontinued,I did a bit of research and choose to give this a whirl. I really wanted to like this stuff,but after months of use,and too many negative points,I needed to post a review warning others away from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It smells nice,very light fragrance.I hate products that reek of chemicals! It also absorbs into the skin fairly easily. The price is reasonable,if only it worked!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Oh where to begin?? It caused my skin to burn a bit at first,which I thought was just a sensitivity.That is the only reason I used it for so long.However,the more I used it,the worse it got.It actually stung! I had to wash it off in order to put on my makeup,otherwise I would have streaks in my foundation. It was almost cakey in spots.The packaging is not the best,you couldn&#x27;t tell how much was left even if the stuff worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would do better sticking to Olay or some comparable product,at least they have sensitive formulas which won&#x27;t sting or burn everytime you put it on.</li>
    <li> I could not tell any difference. There is very little in the tube. I think it is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was happy with this product.  I still am using this serum.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product once before, and I really like it.  It feels good on my skin, and I will probably order again once I use this second container.</li>
    <li> I have been using this 3 times a day for 6 weeks and have not noticed any improvement whatsoever. Using extra moisturizer of any kind should have improved my skin slightly, but nothing with this stuff. About my skin, I&#x27;m a 30 year old white female. I do not have many wrinkles, in fact, I only have one small crease near the right corner of my mouth. This small crease used to only show when I smiled, but now it remains after I stop smiling. I wanted something to make it less noticeable. My tiny crease is nowhere near a major wrinkle, so if this cream works at all it should have made some improvement. It did nothing. Also, I noticed an increase in the number of pimples I was getting around my mouth. I wanted to get rid of the remaining cream so I started using it all over my face once a day and it increased the number of pimples on my face by 100%, so now I know it was this cream that caused the increased pimples near my mouth. I will not buy again, waste of time and money for my skin.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference in skin texture.  Seeps into skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  Love this product!!!  I use this @ night on hands face  &amp; neck</li>
    <li> at 66 I really am lucky to not have a lot of wrinkles ,due to pretty healthy living and great gene&#x27;s,after seeing many commercials and knowing Neutrogena puts out mainly great products like their Light Sesame Body oil,I decided to try the Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum,not at all impressed....did absolutely nothing I can see....back to Garnier for me</li>
    <li> This is the only product I can see a difference when I use it and see notice when I DON&#x27;T use it. I use it on my neck and under the chin.</li>
    <li> Not a face lift for sure, some improvement, but not any more noted than if using a good moisturizer.  Does any of it really work?</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product was not compatible with my sensitive skin and the fragrance was too intense.</li>
    <li> One of the best Neutrogena products- put a thin layer on a night before moisturizer.  It completely softens and resurfaces your skin without being too harsh.  Over time it diminishes age spots too.</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER USES THIS AND I BOUGHT IT FOR  HER.  SHE LOVES IT AND USES IT EVERY DAY</li>
    <li> Got this with other Neutrogena facial products because simply put....there&#x27;s just no other way! It really does work ladies (and gentlemen). The pricing can&#x27;t be beat anywhere else either. Shipping was superfast too, and well packaged!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works. It&#x27;s the only stuff that works instantly.</li>
    <li> This first then the Tone Repair Moisturizer.  I look like a babe.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> Wife liked it. She has not complained so if mama&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have used it for about 1 year and I really like it because it absorbs into my skin, isn&#x27;t oily, doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, and brightens my skin.  I think it evens out the skin tones.  I don&#x27;t know if it reduces wrinkles or not, I can&#x27;t say that I have really noticed any dramatic change, but I definitely think it makes my skin look better.  I have tried other moisturizers and wrinkle creams but they tend to be too heavy and make my skin break out.  This just makes my skin look really pretty and soft.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product and I have tried many more expensive ones. This is now a staple in my beauty daily regimen and I get so many comliments on my skin. Many ask if I have had Work done. No, just a great product.</li>
    <li> Neither rapid nor reparative, just stinks. The smell is overpowering. There are so many better products on the market to choose.</li>
    <li> I have used several different Neutragena products.  I decided to try this Rapid Wrinkle Repair with retinal SA.  Well, I must be allergic or something.  My face looks as though I have been punched.  Underneath my eyes is so red, flaky and SWOLLEN.  I have never had bags under my eyes, but I do now.  I could hardly see over the puffiness. I am on day 3 waiting for this reaction to go away.</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic, I would never buy \\&quot;anti wrinkle\\&quot; cream or any other cream that proves to do some miracle.  But this worked; really it&#x27;s worth the money!  In fact I have learned that Neutrogena has a line of products that I plan to check out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 38 and show very faint lines under my eyes, mostly when I smile-my under eyes seem to wrinkle!  I used the product under my eyes every day morning and night for a week...no change.  Then around the end of the following week I just happened to get ready to apply the serum and realized \\&quot;wow, those lines are barely there!\\&quot;  Now, this doesn&#x27;t completely ERASE the lines you have but the skin becomes tighter and the \\&quot;faint\\&quot; lines do seem to disappear.  I noticed the skin seemed drier than normal so I make sure I use a moisturizer on top of the serum.  I did not use this product on any other lines on my face, because the only ones I have are under the eyes.  I won&#x27;t be able to let you know about other areas and how the serum works for those!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle or tube this comes in is perfect to use.  Its pump action delivers a generous amount (I usually am careful to only use a half pump so I don&#x27;t waste the excess).  The serum is silky and absorbs nicely.  There were no side affects or burning or any other issues.  I was careful to only apply under the eyes and not get to close to the under eye lid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product because it works!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s so much to like in this product. It smells lovely, it goes on smoothly without being sticky, and it works. I paired it with a moisturizer over it because I have dry skin and after a couple of weeks I do see that my smile lines are not as deep and defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that the retinol would either make my skin red and itchy or make me super sensitive to the sun. I found neither happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this new serum via Vine, since I had been wanting to try it. I find that the Neutrogena retinol products work very well on my skin, improving quality and decreasing wrinkles with little irritation. This serum smells good, smooths on quickly and disappears quickly, is in an ingenious tube with applicator, and works!</li>
    <li> seems to be working well on my forehead but the scent could be better</li>
    <li> Good, like the daytime product better, has sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Did not see instant results but did soften skin around eyes after about three weeks. First week or so of use produced a slight burning sensation but lessoned.  Tiny drop goes a long way. Nice fragrance. Will continue use.</li>
    <li> Will it cure your wrinkles overnight and give you a face like a twenty year old? No.  But with constant use it will help to smooth out some of those crows feet and vertical marks between our eyebrows.  So be happy for what it does for you but don&#x27;t expect to look like you found the fountain of youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zeb Kantrowitz</li>
    <li> This is a nice product, but a bit expensive for the amount that comes in the tube.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other products but have not found any that work nearly as well as this one. I use it with the daily morning and evening lotions and it works great! I wouldn&#x27;t say I am line free, but for 39 years old, I think I look better than some in their early 30s.</li>
    <li> I definitely saw some lines disappear overnight , and some more after a week, it also soften the big wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this serum. I was part of a test group for a similar product by another brand and was really pleased with how my skin looked at the end of the testing. Neutrogena has the same basic ingredients and is better priced than the other brand, plus I&#x27;ve been a fan of their products for years. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for over six months and my skin has shown a definite improvement - it&#x27;s a lot smoother and blemishes heal faster. Fine wrinkles around my eyes are less visible. It&#x27;s very gentle, absorbs quickly and has a pleasant aroma. I&#x27;ll be buying it online since the stores can&#x27;t beat the online price.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My skin feels so much softer. I notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
    <li> The wrong product was sent to me. It was a similar product but it damaged my skin. Not ordering this type of item again on Amazon.</li>
    <li> First, let me say I am only 30...but I am starting to get wrinkles/creases at the corners of my eyes, and around my mouth.  I have always had creases in my forehead, but they are getting worse in appearance as I get older.  Since this is such an affordable lotion, I was thrilled to be able to try it through the Vine program...something I could afford to continue to use if I liked it.  Sadly, the only thing I liked about this product is that it is a great lotion to use daily because it makes your skin incredibly soft!  Baby butt soft!  It is a small tube, just like all other wrinkle creams, but it lasted me approx 5 weeks...not bad for under $20.  The tube &amp; pump design also allow you to get every last bit out of the tube with little effort.  I took before and after pictures, which I will upload at a later date, but what is the point...there was no change in my wrinkles/creases...none at all!  It didn&#x27;t even out any blotchiness I have, or help fade sun-spots from tanning in my younger years...very disappointing!!  Applying the lotion is super easy as the tube has a little pump on it and dispenses just the right amount for my face in 1 pump.  It is a silky, non-greasy, pleasantly smelling lotion that will trick you!!  You think, \\&quot;Oh, this goes on sooooo easy, and smells wonderful...let me get closer to my lip area because I have some wrinkles forming\\&quot;...and then 10 minutes later your lips catch on fire and remain on fire for a few days.  I quickly found out it was the lotion incinerating my lips, but within those 5 weeks, I still occassionally got it on my lips just a little bit and the fire started all over again.  This was an odd experience for me because I do not have sensitive skin at all, quite the opposite actually.  I would have loved to continue to use the lotion because it made my skin so soft, but the whole lips-catching-on-fire thing kinda blew it.  From reading other reviewers, some have had very positive experiences...so I say, for less than $20, give it a try!!!  Just avoid the lip area and hope you don&#x27;t have wrinkles there.  :-)a try!!!  Just avoid the lip area and hope you don&#x27;t have wrinkles there.  :-)</li>
    <li> In love with this product, very beautiful scent, love it the moment I apply it to my face, buying my second tube, lovely results from the 3rd try &lt;3</li>
    <li> I got this to help with hormonal breakouts (unfortunately it can&#x27;t help the hormone part) where I also had some redness and scarring from recently healed pimples. It&#x27;s been a week, and I&#x27;m impressed. It has significantly reduced the redness, inflammation and scarring and I&#x27;ve not had a new pimple since I started use. I wash my face with 2% salycilic acid and it couldn&#x27;t clear the breakouts his stuff has! I guess my skin is pretty resilient, because I&#x27;ve used every day with no negative side effects.</li>
    <li> nice weight and texture.  light and smooth.  I think that I will be less fustrated by unreachable residue in the bottom of the bottle with this tube/pump design.</li>
    <li> Ive been using Neutrogen for over a month now and I can say my skin texture has improved a lot. The fine lines became less prominent. I love the non greasy feeling after application. I will surely recommend it to my friends who worry about aging</li>
    <li> I love how this soaks right into my skin.  First I put this on, then wait a few minutes for it to soak in and follow up with face cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this stuff actually works, or if it&#x27;s more of a placebo type of thing. All I know is that I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 years, and my only lines are some tiny crow&#x27;s feet. I&#x27;m not really sure what a natural-looking 41 year old woman is supposed to look like, but so far I&#x27;m ok with the way it&#x27;s turning out. So I&#x27;ll keep using the Rapid Wrinkle Repair! By the way, it arrived quickly (it IS rapid, after all!), and in good condition. Just what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good, working smooth on skin. But not sure about how it can reduce the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Very good product and much cheaper here on amazon than at walmart.</li>
    <li> SO FAR THIS PRODUCT IS LIVING UP TO DESCRIPTION IT LEAVES YOUR FACE FEELING SOFT, NO IRRITATION NO REDNESS&lt;br /&gt;NO STINGING, NO HARSH SMELL</li>
    <li> It works pretty well.</li>
    <li> This burned my skin badly and I had to discontinue using it after three days. I&#x27;d been using the Neutrogena deep wrinkle serum but the store was out of stock and I decided to give this a try. Because it is by Neutrogena, I made the mistake of purchasing the product without first reading the ingredients label. After reading the label, I discovered it has added fragrance. I sure it is the fragrance that is the culprit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this product.  Within 2 weeks, the results were obvious. My husband, who has no idea how to pay a compliment, said I looked younger. What more do I need to say?</li>
    <li> I love the Wrinkle Repair Serum.  Helps soften wrinkles.  Quick delivery, awesome seller.</li>
    <li> I saw results within a couple of days.  This did not irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it.  I am 66 with good skin and a couple of wrinkles beneath my eye, it really really works!!!!</li>
    <li> You can almost watch the lines and wrinkles fill in and plump up before your eyes. Neutrogena is my favorite for skin care .</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rapid Repair Serum works really great.  I&#x27;m 52 years old.  I&#x27;m not a sun worshiper and I&#x27;ve tried to take care of my skin, however no matter who you are, age is a factor.  I have deep &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines between my eyebrows.  I noticed my tone was a bit uneven.  I STILL get the occasional breakout (nope; did not stop with age).  I used to have oily skin, now during the winter I have combination oily, dry.  I started using a retinal containing product, consistently, about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I saw no reason to drop a load of money on a department store retinal containing product.  I&#x27;ve tried ROC, which is a high quality product, but disliked the odor; then I tried Neutrogena.  I&#x27;ve decided to stick with Neutrogena.  I also like the pump, which keeps the remaining, unused product, clean.  In the year that I&#x27;ve used the Neutrogena, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; is diminished.  My skin is smoother, and the tone is more even.  The added benefit is that it helps with adult acne breakouts.  I did not want to use a benzoyl peroxide containing product, which is too harsh for mature skin.  My routine is simple; I cleanse my face at night.  I apply the Neutragena Rapid Repair Serum (a single pump), then I apply a very light, quickly absorbing facial cream.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Tried this product for about 6 months now and haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin at all. Skin does feel good after application, dried my skin a bit but decided the expense was not worth it. Will be trying coconut oil instead.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 40s and my skin started to sag a little bit and also started to develop vertical lines around lips and on my forehead. I purchased this product because its great reviews and I can confirm that it really works. I started to see improvement after just one use. I have been using this product over two weeks now and my fine lines are much less pronounced my skin seems to be tighter overall. I was considering laser treatment for my wrinkles but now I feel it can wait. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My skin flakes and peels and I get oozing sores.  I cannot use this product at all.  I can&#x27;t imagine what is in this that would cause my skin to ooze like I have leprosy.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Not all skin is the same (so it may not work for you) but this one really does help make my skin look and feel smoother.  I am taking a star off because even at the sale price of $12.52, that is still overpriced for such a tiny 1 oz bottle!  How do these manufacturers get away with charging so much for so little?  I don&#x27;t think this should cost more than $10 regular price (not sales price).  However, I do like it enough that I ordered 3 bottles at the sales price.</li>
    <li> does not diminish wrinkles yet alone take them away. normally i love all neutogena products if they do what they say they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This has made my wife look like an 18 yr old again.  This will extend our marriage at least 2 years!</li>
    <li> I see no difference since using it 2 months.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this but I had a terrible allergic reaction to this product. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin either! It&#x27;s taken about one week for it to calm down.</li>
    <li> We all know what works for some doesn&#x27;t work for others. Well, this one didn&#x27;t work for me, either (like many of the other reviews stated). I&#x27;m 39, with a fair complexion and starting to get some pretty defined wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead. This product didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. I&#x27;ll have to try some more expensive products and see if there&#x27;s a difference. True: you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This claims to brighten and even under eye area, smooth fine lines &amp; texture, and reduce the look of dark circles with visible results in one week. I used this every night for a month and I saw no improvement.  My fine lines and dark circles didn&#x27;t change at all.  I love many other things by Neutrogena, especially the face make-up.  But this eye cream didn&#x27;t do any of the things it claimed. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I try to take pretty good care of my skin and this product will make it into my daily routine.  I have been putting it on at night after I clean and dry and skin and it rubs in well.  Overall I don&#x27;t have severe wrinkles or bags just laugh lines and frown creases.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting baby like skin afterwards so the reductions in wrinkles and brighter looking skin have been a great treat!</li>
    <li> I did not see a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Love Love Love. I use around my eyes and on my forehead. Also, softens my skin.</li>
    <li> They advertise this for wrinkles, but the retin-a is great for acne! I use this everyday as a substitute for differin (expensive retin-a prescribed) and it does wonders. It accelerates the skin turnover rate so it fights wrinkles but for me it heals pimples quickly and fades red marks. Also because you are turning over cells quickly, the dead skin doesn&#x27;t get stuck in your pores and cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. It goes perfect under makeup, is non greasy, smells great, and is effective. I&#x27;m impressed considering the low price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> perfect, just as described</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed improvement in the fine lines around my eyes, top lip and across my forehead. Unfortunately, within several days, I also developed acne all around my face. Silicone-based products like this one make me break out, but if you don&#x27;t have this problem, give this serum a try for anti-aging benefits.</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutroena night moisturizer for 2 years and I really like this cream. I thought I&#x27;d step up my regimen and try the serum. Well, I am almost done with the tube and I have decided to stop using all together. This serum is extremely drying ( and I have pretty tough skin ). I tried to use a moisturizer over it, but it still did not help. I have developed new wrinkles with this serum and my skin felt like sandpaper. I will discard what is remaining of this product. Too bad, I had great expectations of this serum.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  It helps with fine lines and seems to make a difference.  Not the fountain of youth, though.  Darn it!!!</li>
    <li> So terrible. do not but it. My skin actually looks flawless without any creams but with some creams it becomes even shinier, so I do use the creams to look 10 years younger. this cream made my skin looks dull and completely awful. in addition it burns the skin and leave red marks. Unless you want an experiment with your skin, then you should buy it.</li>
    <li> The product is very nice, but I&#x27;m not fond of pumps as they often leave a residue in the container. May try again, as I&#x27;m comparing it to another product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same as all the other OTC retinol products.I did not see a big difference after 30 days and am switching back to my original product from ROC.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT BUY FORF MYSELF SO I CANNOT GIVE AN HONEST COMMENT.</li>
    <li> Love to use this under my moisturizer. Drys quick!</li>
    <li> Very please with my set.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other wrinkle repair product on the market.  I no longer use this brand.</li>
    <li> I am a faithful retinol user, but I prefer serum to cream.  This is not a bad product, but I never felt like it really soaked in...like it got where it was supposed to be going.</li>
    <li> Something seems to be working....finally...</li>
    <li> really like this. absorbs fast and makes skin soft and supple. The wrinkle repair is up for debate, but still a nice serum to use for the price</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product at first.  It made my skin smooth and pretty after the first application and it&#x27;s cheaper than my usual retinol product.  After I used it for about a week, I noticed my acne was getting worse, which is why (at age 27) I use products with retinol.  My skin is very sensitive and I didn&#x27;t experience any sort of tingling or redness from this product.  I did, however, get a number of painful bumps (cystic acne) as well as whiteheads/pimples.  This product definitely didn&#x27;t work for me, but it seems to work for others.  I will be going back to my tried and true retinol serum.</li>
    <li> It is very early in the process, but I am please with the results to date!</li>
    <li> hi more than expected. thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for a cheaper alternative to dermalogica overnight repair serum. With dermalogica, I noticed the fine lines on my forehead and dryness on my cheeks smooth out dramatically and become hydrated! I also loved how this serum was very moisturizing and helped to battle dry, santa ana winds in San Diego. This result ( forehead smoothness) occurred before the 3 day sample was up!! I stood in front of my mirror, in awe and was shocked the lines flattened out. So much so, I could see white lines of my forehead, where the sun could not reach!I purchased dermalogica and loved, but was layed off and cannot justify spending ~$50 on a serum. I&#x27;ve seen the commercials for Neutrogena and after reviews on amazon, I thought this would be comparable and save me an  extra $20 or so. . .  I noticed dryness and peeling skin around jawline and my nose...but this was to be expected. This is the first product I&#x27;ve used with retinol and I am still adjusting how much to use. I have used it every other night, for two weeks and mainly on my forehead, because it doesn&#x27;t peel in this area. At this point, I am not noticing the dramatic change in the smoothness of my forehead wrinkles that I got with dermalogica. I like it, but decided to purchase overnight repair serum from dermalogica because the results were fast and noticeable. I want this to work but for me, but it did not give me results as advertised. :(</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum works great and for a very economical cost. I was truly amazed how well it works. I originally purchased this product because of a review I read. I have checked out this product and found that I can definitely see improvement with my wrinkles, so I ordered 4 more 1 oz. serum packages. This is one product I don&#x27;t want to be without and I strongly recommend buying.</li>
    <li> I love everything Neutrogena, so I may be biased.  But I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena products since I was ten years old and my mother first started teaching me to wash my own face, every night.  This product is just awesome.  I definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> As the ad says, &amp;#34;if it doesn&#x27;t work you&#x27;re onto the next thing.&amp;#34; Well this works. Makes my skin look and feel like it did 20 years ago. I&#x27;m 50. I prefer the serum over the daytime and nighttime versions. You can apply it day or night. It really makes your skin feel smooth, whereas the day and night versions of this are more of a moisturizer and make it feel a little...I wouldn&#x27;t say greasy...but moisturized. The serum seems to disappear immediately and really leaves a beautiful smooth and soft feel to your skin. I notice a difference if I don&#x27;t use it even one day. Try it out. I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> It is an ok moisturizer but I can not see any difference in wrinkles after using it for 2 months.  Will go back to my old moisturizer when this is gone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and get compliments all the time how young I look .&lt;br /&gt;I am 43 and get told I look 33 so this stuff works&lt;br /&gt;I still have little lines on forehead and by my eyes but are very light&lt;br /&gt;I use my cream every am after I get out of shower and my pores are open&lt;br /&gt;It seems to help and I have never had any skin reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended !!!!!!</li>
    <li> didnt work at all waste of money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this about ten days. I put it on before I go to bed each night. I have been good about protecting my skin from the sun, but I still have a few sun spots.  The freckles/spots are almost gone and the smile lines around my eyes are noticeably improved. I say noticeably, because my husband remarked on it. It seems fairly mild for a retinol cream. I only had very mild stinging on the second night. I am also using a mild exfoliating scrub every other day. The fragrance is a tad sweet for me, but that isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, especially since I&#x27;m really seeing results. It&#x27;s very dry where we live, so I don&#x27;t use it sparingly, needing the moisture. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> First I want to say that at amazon.com this product was the best buy.  I have used Neutrogena products for about 10 years therefore I trust the company.  The newest product that I have tried is the Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum and I have been pleased with the results.  I am 70 years old and people say I look about 60 years old.</li>
    <li> It seems to help but not like the more expensive brands. After I peeled it was great to moisturize my face</li>
    <li> I did not notice a huge improvement after use of this product. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not wrinkled enough, or if it&#x27;s just not working right. It doesn&#x27;t hurt anything to use it, but probably other products will be just as good, and perhaps not quite as costly.</li>
    <li> I had heard good things about this serum from a youtube guru and her 70 yr. old mother looked AMAZING and used it and she came on to say,\\&quot;I have seen my forhead and cheek wrinkles get smaller. I decided to try it cause I had a $3 dollar coupon and HATE spending money on things that don&#x27;t work.. I used it at 3:00 and kept kind of putting some on through out the night then washed my face put it on where ever there is any sort of fine lines and I SWEAR I used nothing else than this that day and I woke up and my face looked amazing. it looked more even toned and the fine lines on my forhead were barley there and the most problem I had was frown lines and those were pretty much gone and a little scar I had on my lip was softer and less agitated. I will never not buy this stuff. It is not to much reitnol and I had NO redness or irritation at all and I have VERY sensitive skin. I just love it and so glad I decided to buy.. THank you SO much Neutrogena! There products have always been so effective and non irritating on my skin, I have been using Oil Of Olay and still will always use the Micro sculpting cream cause I have little little line on my face and I&#x27;m 36 and people tell me I look 22.Had to come back and put another comment. I went on a trip and forgot to take this, came back home and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere? (someone probably stole it cause it&#x27;s so good :) but anyway I thought well I&#x27;ll buy it again soon but how bad can my skin look without it. WELL a month later I SWEAR my lines are showing more,my skin isn&#x27;t glowing and I can tell a difference.. I realized this product has to be in my life FOREVER.. I am going to buy it tomorrow and I will never be without it again..Oh I will come back in a week and tell you what difference it has made..</li>
    <li> This works like a low level chemical peel, great for fine wrinkles and imperfections.  So far so good, my skin is looking better, younger, but will need to use this long term.</li>
</ol>
