<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I began using the Amara HA about a month ago and have seen excellent results.  I am 69 years old and my skin is smooth and clear.  Really like this product.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me. It didn&#x27;t work. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> From the first application I could feel the difference.  It made my face glow, and at 64 years old that means a lot.  I&#x27;m sticking with this product!!!</li>
    <li> Feels great on skin and you notice a different</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all.  I have very sensitive skin, prone to acne.  After just a few days, this product made my skin break out.  It took me over a week of not using it to clear up the problems this product created.  I would not recommend this to product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I love this product. It does the job.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic Hyaluronic Acid, plumps your skin while slowly eliminating your wrinkles.  I love this stuff, so much better than Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> My skin is glowing and people notice it. My friend approached me with compliments on my glow and tight skin. Definitely my fine lines disappeared and crow feet by my eyes are barely there. I&#x27;m 54 with good skin in general. I&#x27;m using it in the morning  under a moisturizer and at night  before applying vitamin C serum. So i have two serums at night.</li>
    <li> Very delicate floral scent... makes skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Works far better than I anticipated !</li>
    <li> This serum is great. I received an email from Jennifer at Amara Organics thanking me for my order &amp; giving me the directions how to use the serum to get the most benefits from it. I love the way it feels when I put in on my skin. I love the way my skin looks after I put it on. I have only been using it for 3 days and I am so happy with it. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in a month!</li>
    <li> I usually never write reviews but this product is amazing! I have very oily skin so of course acne comes along with that, I don&#x27;t have very bad acne but after using this serum I literally never break out anymore and if I do, it goes away within a day. I haven&#x27;t been using this serum long enough to really give a review about the anti aging claims but my skin definitely looks more even toned after a couple weeks. I would highly recommend this serum to anyone!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to get full results, (less than a month),  but I can tell you that in this short time period, I can see a definite difference in the appearance of my skin.  It&#x27;s texture is much smoother, clearer, and it&#x27;s given me an overall improvement that I know is there, but just quite can&#x27;t put my finger on. And what I love the most so far is that my makeup looks better.  I am looking forward to future months of using this product.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I use this nightly &amp; after a derma roll treatment.  I can see an improvement with my skin in only a week.  I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve been using this my lower and upper eyelid wrinkles have decreased. I don&#x27;t look so tired anymore, and that&#x27;s wonderful for me!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Plumps up the facial fine lines and brightens your skin. My skin is much smoother and I have been using daily for about a month.</li>
    <li> Some of these serums don&#x27;t smell good. This one smells like roses! Truly! It felt so good going on.</li>
    <li> This natural and organic vegan serum has done wonders for my skin!  It has added vitamins C and E that add extra nutrients to your skin and provide a wonderful looking appearance.  I recommend this product for its natural ingredients and great results it provides.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all about trying new products to help my face look young! Hyaluronic acid is said to be the newest fountain of youth. I use a few of their other products and have had great results. Goes on smooth, smells good, and leaves no sticky residue. Dries quickly for a smooth finish and makeup goes on right over it. I use morning and night after my regular washing routine. Great price point, great pump bottle, and is more of a gel consistency unlike some others I&#x27;ve tried that are oily.</li>
    <li> I like this serum and have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. Before using this I was noticing my skin was dull and blah. This brought some life back into my skin and has taken a good 5 years off (probably in dead skin cells and lack of moisture) in just the time I have had to use it. I have had great success with Amara products up to this point, I am happy to say I will be a loyal shopper for life!</li>
    <li> This has become part of my washing routine. I use this two times a day, and have found that just one pump of the serum is enough. I played with amounts when I first received this. It dries quickly, which is nice. You don&#x27;t have to wait long to apply your moisturizer. I have used other products in the past, that worked well, but smelled awful. Based on the smell alone, I stopped using them. I don&#x27;t find that to be an issue with this product. There is little to no smell at all, and this product glides on evenly and easily. Also, unlike other products. There is not sticky residue after you apply. I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it, as I am excited to see what results it produces.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  I have been happy with all of the Amara Organic products I have but this really feels nice on my skin and I like to use their anti-aging face cream on top!  It&#x27;s nice to find a natural and organic product that leaves my skin feeling great!</li>
    <li> One of the best I have ever used, love it</li>
    <li> I am flabbergasted at how other so called high end department store brands can sell a Vitamin C Serum for $80+ when this Amara Organics serum is available here for quite literally a quarter of the price!  Before I purchased the Amara Serum I compared the ingredients (VERY important to me) of a couple found at Macys and Neiman Marcus and it was a real eye opener.  I used to think for $80, it must be the best!  NOT TRUE!  This Serum has it all  --- it&#x27;s botanically derived, natural, and organic with everything needed to brighten and hydrate your skin.  Since I have been using the Amara serum, my skin has noticeably improved quite a bit.  The fine lines between my eyes, on my forehead, and my crows feet have disappeared.  It is actually very refreshing on your face, unlike some other serums I&#x27;ve tried that make you face feel tight.  Not irritating at all and my skin feels smoother and &amp;#34;uplifted&amp;#34;.  This stuff is addicting!  I wish I had discovered a good serum like this before turning 50 but having it now has made my skin look better than it did a couple of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also addicted to the Amara Organics eye gel.  Great brand with great results at a very affordable price.  Love!  Thank you Amara Organics!</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight, quickly absorbing serum.  I have not been using it for long, but immediately noticed a softening and hydrating feel and look to my skin.  It also seems to tighten and plump up my skin, making me look younger and more radiant.  It comes in a convenient pump bottle and easily dispenses.  I also like that it contains vitamins and organic ingredients, safe for my skin.</li>
    <li> As far as vitamin C serums go, this is a very mild, fragrant one. It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting like some products I have used, yet it retains that nice citrus smell. This bottle should last about three months. I usually start with this, then layer an SPF lotion over it for day time and then at night, put my night cream on top. You want to make sure it dries first though or it might flake.</li>
    <li> I just received the Hyaluronic Acid Serum for skin with vitamins C&amp;E the other day, so I am not sure if it works or not, but I can tell  you that there is virtually no scent, it goes on nicely and does not leave skin feeling sticky.  I am looking forward to seeing the results!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see results for at least a month after first using it but, to my great surprise, I started noticing a significant reduction in the depth of the lines around my eye and on my forehead within a week. I was stunned. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of moisturizers and serums in my lifetime and this is the first one that lives up to its claims. It gives my skin a healthy feeling, and I will be using it daily. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbed into my skin nicely.</li>
    <li> Just started using the serum and so far I am loving the smell and the fact that it does not leave to heavy film like a lot of the serum I have used in the past! I  will update in a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> The company gets a 5-star rating, for me the product a 1-star, so I split the difference and gave it 3-stars. The serum made my face feel dry and look like sandpaper.  When I sent an email response to the company saying how my face looked, I was immediately refunded the full amount. So try it, maybe it will work for you. If not you will probably receive a full refund.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  I don&#x27;t notice a huge improvement but I enjoy using it.  It feels refreshing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum before I go to bed for about a week. I&#x27;ve already found a huge difference in the feel and appearance of my skin! It&#x27;s so much softer, and my fine lines are reducing. I love that it&#x27;s organic and doesn&#x27;t contain ingredients like paraben. The smell is a light citrus and it doesn&#x27;t last for long. It&#x27;s very refeshing! This product is easly dispensed and packaged in a good size that will last quite a while!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Impressed w the results. And excellent, beyond excellent, customer service.</li>
    <li> I am currently using three of the Amara products. The serum is easy to apply and does not leave a sticky after effect some serums do. It absorbs into the skin quickly therefore allowing the moisturizer to to be applied sooner. I cannot testify that the serum has improved my skin but the combination of the serum, moisturizer and eye cream have kept any additional signs of aging from appearing.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s ok. I look for long term benefits and I just started using it...so I have nothing to report except that it keeps my skin in good condition so far.</li>
    <li> I must say that I think that your Hyaluronic Acid Serum is actually making a difference with my skins appearance. Overall, it appears to be evening out the brown/aging spots from sun damage and making my skin feel softer.  I am using less foundation, and it also seems to have a tightening element to it.  You don&#x27;t need much, and I use it in the morning &amp; evening.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum! It&#x27;s so easy to work with because it&#x27;s a gel rather than a liquid. I can definitely see and feel a difference in my skin! I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! My mom has even ordered!!! Definatley will continue to use and I Definatley recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product for few days and immediately from day1 I started seeing NEGATIVE result. Still I continued using the product expecting good result. I followed all the instructions as per their email. But my skin became saggy, wrinkled and lifeless. It lost its elasticity :-( Before using this product, my facial skin was just fine and nothing was needed. When I came across great reviews (I think those are FAKE reviews), I thought of giving it a try. I paid for my greediness! IF YOU HAVE REASONABLY GOOD SKIN (OR EVEN BAD SKIN), I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I returned the item for a full refund. I have to check my refund though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum on my face daily since I received it a few weeks ago, and I must say that it has exceeded my expectations. I apply it nightly before I use my lotion, and it goes on smoothly without leaving any kind of oily residue. My skin looks healthier and brighter, and it has helped with the dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve even noticed a difference in my smile lines around my eyes and my mouth. I don&#x27;t typically use anti-aging serums or similar beauty products, but I&#x27;m glad that I gave this a try and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of skin care products, many far more expensive than this one.  Upon reading the reviews, I decided to give this one a try.  Within days, I noticed improvement in the feeling and softness of my skin.  This serum works far better than any I&#x27;ve tried up to this point.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the moisturizer in this line as well.  Very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Ingredients: Deionized Water, Organic Aloe, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, MSM, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Jojoba Oil, Wildcrafted Camellia, Green Tea, Geranium Essential Oil, Vitamins C &amp; E, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Organic Gotu Kola, Organic Horsetail Plant Extract, Organic Geranium Extract, Dandelion Extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: The product comes in a clear glass bottle with a pump. This protects the product from contamination. It is not tested on animals, is made in the USA and stays fresh for 12 months once opened. Only a small amount of the serum is needed to pat or gently smooth on skin. It has a light, fresh rose scent, which lessens once it is absorbed. It absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft and hydrated. The serum lessens the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Since the serum is so light-weight and absorbs so well it can easily be used under makeup or sunscreen. The hyaluronic acid in the serum works to help the skin retain moisture. It reduces tightness, flakey or itchy patches of skin and dryness. Hyaluronic acid is naturally contained in the body, but as we age there is less of it and we need the boost of serums such as this one to obtain and retain moisture and softness. Continued use keeps skin dewy and soft. Even after cleansing the skin remains soft, however it is recommended to use this serum on a daily or twice daily basis. The skin is affected daily by air pollution and the environment, which can lead to dryer skin and damage to the skin. This product soothes the parched skin. Additionally, since the majority of ingredients in this product are organic, purity is assured. While your results may not be exactly like mine, I would recommend this product for everyone looking for improved skin appearance and ongoing smoothness and softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free to test and review.

    <li> I use it everyday and I like it, but do I see difference, no.....</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this product. I have somewhat dry skin but only in a few places on my face. This serum has helped immensely! My dries spots which usually flake and look unattractive are not smooth, soft, and flake free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is very easy to use, just follow these directions for use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Wash and pat skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;  If using toner, apply toner first.&lt;br /&gt;  Apply a small amount of serum with fingertips to entire face, neck and decolletage.&lt;br /&gt;  Allow to dry.&lt;br /&gt;  Follow with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;  Can be used daily, morning or night.&lt;br /&gt;  If layering serums, apply the serum with the thinnest consistency first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes out of the pump relatively thick and a little really goes a long way! It is a clear gel like consistency with a slight citrus scent. Amara Organics stands behind their products and does not test on animals. I recommend this serum to anyone who wants their face to be softer and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is also very reasonably priced! Pick up a bottle for yourself</li>
    <li> This is a really good product! My face instantly feels soft and smooth. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I have been suffering from extremely dry skin lately. After only 2 days my face feels silky smooth. This is the best product I&#x27;ve found that I can use. I suffer from extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t put just anything on it.</li>
    <li> Amara Organics created a great serum for skin product.Let&#x27;s face it nobody likes getting older and having those wrinkle lines or frown lines.This serum contains Vitami C &amp; Vitamin E which this anti aging formula has long lasting effects that will make your skin glow.&lt;br /&gt;You will be surprised at how quick the serum works and the difference it truly makes on your skin.You can expect your skin to be soft,silky and smooth.When i was offered this product for my opinion I was so excited.It seems like (at least for me) when you hit fifty your skin tone and color starts to change.This product helps with those problems.I recommend that you give this serum a try and watch your skin start to look and feel so much better.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service and this stuff feels wonderful when I remember to apply it at night after removing my makeup. I follow it with a light moisturizer and I recommend using it for the neck and decollette area as well. I wake in the morning and feel my face and go, oh yeah, now i remember why it feels so smooth. I didn&#x27;t think I noticed difference but my sister who came to visit did. She kept staring at me, insisting that I got a face peel or something. Sisters! Why do they always think you are lying? LOL</li>
    <li> I really like this product a lot....... I wrote a review on the &amp;#34;Total Eye repair Gel&amp;#34;, so you can get a peek of my outdoor work here in North Texas. You&#x27;ll see that I love the Eye Gel a lot......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I use this product too, and it really seems to help me a lot. What I like best is how it makes my face feel after I put it on. And a little goes a long long way. As a matter of fact it is so thick in the pump bottle that i sometimes run a bit of warm water over it to thin it out some so it pumps super nice. Great product, and worth every penny.....</li>
    <li> I have yet to see any &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; of the skin.  Good ingredients - I guess but does not plump the skin.  What are they talking about?</li>
    <li> Works well, my skin is very soft.</li>
    <li> I am very please with my product. I use it day and night and have had several comments about how pretty my skin looks. I feel much better when I look in the mirror now. I will be continuing to use this from now on.</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered I could feel a semi thickness to the product and a slight tightening to the skin after I put it on. Obviously was not expecting miracles, but was pleased with what I felt and how my skin looked afterwards. Ordered the product a second time and it felt runny - as if watered down - and it went on wet and no tightness whatsoever was felt. My skin looked no different from before I put it on. The first time around  I and a few others thought my skin did appeared a little tighter. But nothing this time. Concerned about the product not being consistent. As I had said, the first time it felt semi thick and my skin felt slightly tighter. But not this time.  The product had a watery consistency and felt wet when applied. Not sure if I will order it again.  Anthony B.</li>
    <li> I received this serum for free in exchange for my honest opinion of the product and after using this serum for about a month I have noticed brighter firmer skin. I use one pump of this serum on occasional days and every night before going to bed. This serum has a slight milky appearance but goes on clear and smooth. It dries evenly and leaves my skin smelling very good. It is packed with vitamins and other natural ingredients such as Jojoba Oil, Green Tea, and Vitamin C &amp; E among other ingredients. This hyaluronic serum has great anti aging effects This product contains no parabens, no alcohol, and is not tested on animals. The results are incredible. I love my glowing appearance and the fact that my face is not dried out from this harsh cold weather. My face is always hydrated and feels great when I apply the serum on and is even firmer! I am loving this hyaluronic acid serum and I think you would enjoy it too!</li>
    <li> By far the best serum I have ever purchased!</li>
    <li> Very good product that I&#x27;m using with Derma Rollers. It is truly an amazing serum. My skin feels softer and I believe it&#x27;s helping clear my skin up as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely buying it again.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice product.  Does what it is suppose to and I use it with my high frequency which helps it to penetrate my skin.</li>
    <li> this serum make me break out in tiny whiteheads almost immediately. I&#x27;ve come to realize that vitamin C causes a lot of people to break out, so these shouldn&#x27;t be sold as being good for all skin types. Thankfully the company has a good refund policy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great !! My skin feel smooth</li>
    <li> Seemed to enlargen my pores, increase skin irritability.</li>
    <li> I love the Hyaluronic acid serum. I have only used the product for less than a month and I can already see that the lines around by eyes and lips have softened. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it does! Will order again</li>
    <li> I bought this to fight the dry NYC winter weather. I apply this each morning under my regular moisturizer. Also, everytime I drink too little water I get some deep nasolabial wrinkels, this product really helps fighting it. It feels really refreshing when applied and you can feel how it sinks into your skin. After is is absorbed I just apply my moisturizer. Nice product, natural, no sketchy ingredients, good value, would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a VERY light moisturizer for awhile. I have oily, acne prone skin and typically moisturizers are too heavy or make me break out. In dance! Just kidding. Really though, sometimes I need just a littttttttle moisture on the surface after washing my face, and this is perfect. Like water, in gel form. Two pumps is enough for face and neck, and I&#x27;ve already ordered another bottle (I get paranoid that the products I love will be discontinued).</li>
    <li> Over 3weeks, no results yet!</li>
    <li> Same results as any of the expensive name brand serums. I saw results within the first few days and I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now. My skin is so soft, it&#x27;s tighter, and glows. I also have acne prone skin and it&#x27;s been so clear which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. Love it</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and hydrating, haven&#x27;t seen big results. I like to use a lot of it under my makeup because it makes it look fresh. I&#x27;ll try the retinol serum at night and see if I get better results using both. I think its good for girls in their 20s not much for 30s.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product.  When I first applied it, I was a little worried that it would make my face feel sticky and gross.  I especially did not want this feeling before going to bed, but to my surprise, it quickly dried and my face did not feel heavy or like anything had been applied to it.  I love the natural, organic ingredients.  It has a very light and pleasant citrus smell that does seem to dissipate as it dries.  Seems to have helped get rid of some of the puffiness under my eyes as well.  I love that.  I think this product is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have used on my skin.  I just love it</li>
    <li> Both the eye gel and this hyaluronic serum are excellent. They are non irritating, moisturizing and firming.  They are inexpensive, compared to other expensive products out there which have chemicals added; chemicals that can irritate and  ultimately not do the job well at all!  This is worth your trying!  I always prefer products that can work WITH your body, not against it!  These I think do.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately when this arrived the plastic seal on top showed that it had already been opened. Yuck.</li>
    <li> Love it works very well seen a difference.</li>
    <li> Again I do not buy this product, Because it does not work I give three stars Because it feels That Moisturizes the skin, but does not work for lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I proved it for three months, and it not Eliminates expression lines.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s helped to clear my face and even my skin tone. I rub it on my face and neck and it feels awesome! After I let it absorb into my akin I use my moisturizer and it has no harsh interactions. Def recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this product not knowing what to expect, but I have found that exceded my expectations, I started to see it was working out a few days after I started using it.  I would certainly recommend it. The shipping was on time and the Price was excellent,</li>
    <li> What a great product! This serum is very necessary for keeping your skin hydrated, dewy and healthy. I love all of Amara Organics products. Love that don&#x27;t include bad chemicals or parabens and the products are organic and vegan! My skin is way more healthy. I&#x27;ve even received compliments on my skin since using Amara Organic products!</li>
    <li> the product doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
    <li> The serum is very impressive .The first couple of days I didn&#x27;t notice to much .But the next day I was simply amazed at the outcome .I have a few deep lines in my forehand the usual crows feet and puffy eyes, When I applied  the  serum I looked in the mirror the wrinkles slowly dissipated and seemed to be have made my face look and feel great ..Great product</li>
    <li> BEST. PRODUCT. EVER. I&#x27;ve tried so many other serums and moisturizers and other face products that cost WAY more than this and none of them have given me what this one has. My skin is smooth, acne has been almost eliminated (peri-menopausal skin is cray cray) and my makeup goes on beautifully. Even got my teen into using it on his face and he&#x27;s been impressed too! Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This is a great produc tand can see an improvement after using it a couple of weeks.  I received my order in two days time!!</li>
    <li> I love it it makes my skin so soft</li>
    <li> I see a more supple and soft skin after using this. Someone had mentioned flaking. Flaking happens if you use another product with this. When that happens, just massage your face and get a pearl result from it! It has happened to me when I forgot I had this on and used another moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product was o.k. but not like I thought it would be,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m far too young to look as old as I do, so I&#x27;m always on a hunt for anything to keep lines at bay. This hyaluronic acid serum went on smooth and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling afterwards, and I&#x27;ve really noticed an improvement in the crows feet and smile lines that have started appearing!</li>
    <li> Okay so I have been using this serum for 2 days now and I have noticed how incredibly moisturized my skin has felt. This winter has left my skin super dry and dull looking and this serum has given it much needed moisture and left a smooth soft to the touch feeling. This product actually really surprised me, I&#x27;ve tried a good amount of similar products and this serum is extremely good quality and my new favorite. My skin is very sensitive and this was beyond gentle, and the fact it is All Natural &amp; Organic makes it that much better! The formula is easy to apply, all you need is dime size amount, and it&#x27;s  very  lightweight, has a light scent (reminds me of baby wash) and most important it DOES not leave your face greasy, oily or sticky what so ever! So needless to say I love this serum, thank you for giving me the opportunity to try this amazing product at such a great price :-)</li>
    <li> I was given an opportunity to write a review for the Hyluronic Acid Serum Vit. C &amp; E purchased at a deep discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we age, we will all get visible lines on our face as our skin loses some fullness. I have noticed my skin has become thinner and much drier as I have aged. However, our lifestyle in the sun can cause skin to age even quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyluronic Acid has been used to help restore skin from some of the effects of aging.  The mission of the Hyluronic Acid Serum with Vit. C &amp; E is to rehydrate your skin and plump up the cells so the skin appearance will look smoother and younger as the serum smooths out fine wrinkles and fine lines.  I think that a serum is especially good because a serum contains higher concentrations of hyluronic acid and vitamins C and E than does a lotion or cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Hyluronic Acid Serum Vit. C &amp; E serum comes in a 1 fl. Oz bottle.  The serum also contains two very powerful antioxidants Vitamin C &amp; E for beautiful skin. The ingredients are botanically derived from plants including Aloe Vera, geranium, camellia, horsetail plant, and dandelion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum goes on easily after washing your face.  To use, apply a small amount to your fingertips and spread over entire face using the remainder to spread on your neck.  Allow the serum to completely dry.  This can then be followed with a daily moisturizer and make up. I also try to use a sunscreen year-round under my moisturizer in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hyluronic Acid Serum Vit. C &amp; E serum can be used daily, morning or night. As I used it over the last few days, some lines on my forehead and the fine lines around my eyes seem to be softened. I did not have any adverse effects on my very sensitive skin.  I have very dry skin, so I needed to continue using a moisturizer after using the serum.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, very floral almost like a rose. Makes skin very even toned. Love this product!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful serum I purchased after researching organic face products.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a big difference, my face looks more clear and even!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had bigger sizes to choose from.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will make it a permanent fixture in my beauty regime.&lt;br /&gt;After continued use for the last month, my skin feels moisturized and looks plumped and dewy. After having a child, I noticed changes in my skin texture and elasticity. My skin looked older and felt drier so I knew I had to make some improvements and changes to my beauty products. This serum has been a godsend!  I used to get dry, flaky skin on my forehead area but this has now disappeared. I recently had my make up professionally done for an event and the artist kept commenting on my complexion and what great skin I have. I knew then that this hyaluronic acid serum is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!! Softer skin after one use</li>
    <li> great product that makes skin feel great</li>
    <li> I have been using for less than ten days, but I think, especially for the price, this is a great product!  Very good customer service - sent a personal e-mail to see if everything is satisfactory, and to ask for feedback.</li>
    <li> The product showed up with the seal compromised. Looks like someone used it and returned it. Not sealed at all.</li>
    <li> I am at an age where life is short on miracles and yet there is a change in the under eye wrinkles with daily use of this product. A welcome result. I have always responded best to gels over creams so I was glad to find this.</li>
    <li> I was thinking about buying something for my face for a long time but never really had the energy to sit and compare and compare and compare... It really is overwhelming the choices out there and than for trial and error and waste so much money I got very discouraged. However, i came across Hyaluronic Acid Serum and decided to try it out. I am very glad that I did. First of all, it has a pump which is extremely convenient for me. Secondly, its organic with no parabens and made in the US. Third what a GREAT price for organic!!!! I have only been using this about a week and my skin has never felt so soft. I apply this in the morning after my usual facial cleansing routine. Adding this to my daily routine has made me super excited about the warm weather coming. I feel like I have new skin!!</li>
    <li> I was able to try this serum and will be keeping it in my daily routine for facial care.  My skin has brightened over the past week, wrinkles (fine wrinkles) are beginning to fade and my skin is soft to the touch.  I am 46 years old and beginning the battle of keeping my skin youthful.  The Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin is going above and beyond to assist in that process.  I use it in the morning underneath my foundation and it has actually helped in keeping my foundation in place all day, (no smearing, running or oily spots during day).  A few days ago I started using it on my hands and am noticing a difference in them as well.  YOUTHFUL skin once again!</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product and works wonderfully even on old skin.  I highly recommend this product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum in combination with another Vitamin C serum i have and the results have been wonderful. I decided to add some extra vitamin C to my skin care regimen because I came back from vacation with an extremely burnt nose unfortunately. I have noticed that my skin does seem more firm and hydrated, youthful. I believe my tone has also evened out from the sun damage. I am very happy with the results so far and will continue to use the serum in my every day regimen. I have been reading a lot about adding hyaluronic acid to your skin care regimen and so far this brand has been amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this product...wish I knew how much hyaluronic acid was in the product</li>
    <li> Like other brand better....</li>
    <li> great product and convenient pump</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several different brands of Hyaluronic Acid Serum, using up each bottle until it&#x27;s gone.  This one is quite watery.  Performs no better or worse than any other serum I&#x27;ve tried, but I don&#x27;t like the watery consistency.  The Peter Roth brand was much better.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t notice anything yet</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I had extremely dry skin around my eyes due to allergies, and in addition to getting a new moisturizer I applied the serum first and within a few days my skin was back to normal and in fact better than before. I will continue to use this serum forever. Absolutely love the fact that it&#x27;s 100 percent chemical free, the only type of products I will use.</li>
    <li> It works really well. Seems like a very good quality product. I&#x27;m happy with it and will reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> This serum is very nice.  Absorbs very quickly.  I do find myself wishing there were more moisture in it, but I just use my regular moisturizer over it.  I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning.  It has a nice smell, not overpowering.  I will probably get more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using high end skin care products for 10 years now.  Never noticed&lt;br /&gt;much with these products except they seem to slow down aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really LOVE Amara Vitamin C serum, Retinol serum &amp; Hyaluronic Acid!  These products have&lt;br /&gt;added radiance and clarity to my skin.  This is the first time in the last 10 years that this has happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the good stuff in the Amara product line, there is no more need to use the&lt;br /&gt;high end products (you know the ones).  Amara products are *clean*&lt;br /&gt;without the chemicals and weird stuff.  Amara has everything needed for&lt;br /&gt;healthy radiant skin!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. I can see the difference on my face. Will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product,  I love to use it.  It works excellent.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has really reduced the fine lines in my face and especially the deeper ones in my neck and decollege (sp?). AND it&#x27;s cruelty-free- a huge selling point for me! It feels good on my skin and a little goes a long way. I am very happy with this purchase :)</li>
    <li> Great product! Non greasy and it makes my skin glow. My face also feels really smooth after applying this. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing. I have struggled with acne for 20 plus years. It helps with breakouts,  and does a wonderful job of fading acne scars.</li>
    <li> A boost before my moisturizer. Not really much to it, yet my skin loves it! Great price point, too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I really feel like this is making a difference for my skin.</li>
    <li> Price again is good. Feels good and little firmness, but useage not long enough to tell if it is a keeper. Will continue with this along with eye serum.</li>
    <li> Feels like a drink of water for the skin.</li>
    <li> Great so far.  I just purchased this about a week or so ago.  It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  My skin seems to react well to it.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the changes in my skin over the weeks.  I am now thinking of purchasing the retinol serum!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and most importantly,  the product doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. I really like it .Thanks !</li>
    <li> This is a clean pure product and offers great hydration.  I am pregnant and am having all kinds of strange breakouts and dryness... this products really helped!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been one month since I started using this product. My skin definitely feels and looks smoother. In the summertime I just use this alone in the morning sometimes without a facial moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> I researched hyaluronic acid prior to making this purchase.  I had determined that organic is the best as it doesn&#x27;t contain other additives.  There aren&#x27;t many organic options for this product.  I ordered only one bottle but wish I&#x27;d ordered more......on some areas of my face, the wrinkles honestly smoothed out and minimized on the first application.  Other areas are taking a little longer but it hasn&#x27;t even been a month and I&#x27;m very impressed.  I will continue to use it....this is the ONLY topical product I&#x27;ve tried that actually worked!</li>
    <li> This product works very well to help my complexion stay smooth and moist. Furthermore, it is less expensive than I found from other companies.</li>
    <li> Works well, helps tighten the skin around the face</li>
    <li> It is working well for my skin</li>
    <li> Try it girls, for my 57 year old skin, it has really made the difference. This is not my first purchase of theis proiduct, but I will tell you this is the best price i&#x27;ve found for it, Read all they are saying about &amp;#34;hyaluronic and vitamin C&amp;#34; for aging skin!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 6 weeks now and I have seen NO RESULT WHATSOEVER.  I have a dark spot (not real dark) above my lip.  Without makeup it looks like slight dirt spot.  I have 2 dark spots on my back.  I have been using this 2x a day, every single day faithfully and I see absolutely no improvement.  Do not bother buying this....it&#x27;s a waste of money.  I&#x27;m so annoyed because now i have to search for something else. I&#x27;d appreciate any suggestions but only if it really works.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> makes my skin bright over time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some improvement in the texture of my skin</li>
    <li> I think it helps maintain my skin.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing! I use it every night on my entire face and neck. I have very sensitive and have had a bad reaction to 2 previous vitamin C serums I bought but not this one! Thank you for great product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Already see a difference in my skin texture.</li>
    <li> this serum is amazing y&#x27;all!!!! I usually don&#x27;t do reviews unless I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied and I must say I am MOST SURELY satisfied!!!  The makers of this serum is also in the works in creating a face and body wash and I cant wait.  I have eczema all over and the ointment that I use has steroids in it which causes my skin to discolor.  I&#x27;ve only been using Amara&#x27;s for three days and I can already see results.  My skin is smooth and soft and I can already see the dark spots fading.  Thank you Amara!!!</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever used. My skin is very soft and radiant. By far, this is the best product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months. My face looks and feels smoother. I use it twice daily. No odor. Goes on smooth and dries quickly. I wear it under my makeup with no problem. The product is priced right. I was impressed with the follow up from Amara Organics after my purchase explaining how to use the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and it&#x27;s done wonders for my dry skin. It&#x27;s has also made a difference in the under eye area making my skin look refreshed and rested. It&#x27;s also great under my makeup it gives my skin a nice glow. Love it this product and has quickly become a staple for my everyday skin care routine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clean and effective. Better than some of the much-hyped lines of skin product that promise results both both irritate and don&#x27;t deliver.</li>
    <li> Unsatisfied with this product - not only did it not lead to any hydration, it actually resulted in irritation and dry skin. Made my skin feel very tight. Requesting a refund (as promised by the manufacturer)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Amara Hyaluronic acid serum.  I use with Amara Vitamin C serum.  I am 75 years old, so no miracles, but I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, so glad I discovered it (Thanks, Mom!).  I love the texture, it absorbs quickly, very easy to apply. I feel it helps with lines, creases, etc, especially over time.  Highly recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Hyaluronic Serum on my face for a few months and love it.  I have dry skin and usually have to apply lotion multiple times after washing my face as it feels so dry.  Now I apply the serum and and only have to apply lotion once.  My skin feels great, very soft and I think my skin looks brighter..  I try to apply in both morning and evening.  Very little serum is needed for each application so the bottle lasts a long time.  I will definitely reorder this.</li>
    <li> um... WOW!!! this syuff really works and for so cheap!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I am 45 my skin is smooth, my fine lines are gone! Yes I said gone. I have a wonderful glow. I Have not worn powder or base of any kind in 2 months. I bought the product in mid April. It is June. I just reordered. Only once a day it dries quickly. Little hint I even use a little on my upper hands and elbows. Huge difference! I love this product. Make up free with a huge smile on my face...couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> I am 22 years old with extremely fair, sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve started to notice the beginnings of smile lines and so, I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for something that will prevent them from developing any further. I&#x27;ve had better and faster-acting, but for a more expensive price. This serum absorbs quickly but does little else. If you&#x27;re seeking the toning and firming benefits of hyaluronic acid, this serum is not very potent at all. That being said, if you&#x27;re just looking for a nice serum made with organic ingredients, this is definitely a good option.&lt;br /&gt;As for the vitamin C, it is true that a product with a beneficial amount will taste sour or bitter. This product, as other reviews state, really does just taste like water. Do PAY ATTENTION to any percentages of hyaloronic acid and vitamin C when a product claims to have them. This product has no mention of how much of each ingredient is actually contained within the bottle, and I suspect it&#x27;s very little. Point being- this is not an effective anti-aging product by any means whatsoever. I&#x27;ve been using this since I received it, exactly 20 days ago, twice a day. Also note that many of these reviews were probably paid for or sponsored (meaning you have to write a good review in order to receive/keep the product for free. Fair trade? )&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m a bit disappointed with this purchase, though I do commend the fact that they use recognizable ingredients.</li>
    <li> love it made me happy</li>
    <li> I was Amazon looking for other organic facial products and came across this stuff.  Other customers who purchased the same thing I did also purchased this Amara Organics Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I usually use Estee Lauder Total Repair Serum and decided to try this after reading the great reviews it received.  I am so glad I purchased this because I have been using this for 2 weeks along with the Amara Organics Total repair Eye Gel.  This stuff had brightened my complexion and it appears to be firmer and dewy.  A little does go a long way and you get a lot for the price. I use this along with my Shea Terra Organics Rose Hips and perfecting Serum and my skin looks amazing.</li>
    <li> This product was sent to me complimentary in exchange for an honest review, which can be viewed at http://theboldandthebrewtiful.blogspot.com/2015/04/review-amara-organics-hyaluronic-acid.html.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using a Hyaluronic Acid Serum so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  The product is a powerful anti-aging serum that is used for plumping fine lines and wrinkles into smooth skin, by boosting collagen production and restoring the skin&#x27;s natural elasticity.  The Vitamin C and E in this product help protect your skin naturally from free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that it was a very thick gel-like serum. It came in a clear 1 fl oz glass bottle and had a pump. It had a pleasant fragrance. This serum when applied to my skin sort of tingled at first but didn&#x27;t notice anything else about it. It absorbed really fast and wasn&#x27;t sticky at all.  My skin reacted to this serum though. It turned really red. It was not itchy and did not burn. It just turned red. Not sure if that is a sign that it&#x27;s stimulating my blood and working or what, but I didn&#x27;t mind.  After a week of use, my skin feels tighter and slightly more firm along my upper cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints to share. I think this serum works as it should and I cannot wait to see how well it works after I have continued to use it for a while.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and will order it again.  It works well and quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this product !!!</li>
    <li> Purchased the product last month and so far I&#x27;m loving it... My face feel so smooth and not oily at all.. Definitely will buy again...</li>
    <li> Seems to help those nasty little lines!</li>
    <li> Wrinkle be gone! Well maybe that&#x27;s dramatic, but it&#x27;s definitely making a fast improvement in the wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes. My skin feels softer and looks more refreshed. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with acne which is very important since I&#x27;ve dealt with that type of reaction from similar products in the past. The serum absorbs well and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. The pump gives just the right amount that I need to cover my face and neck so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting any.  Disclosure: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated in any way, nor promised any future promotions.</li>
    <li> This serum feels cool and is lightweight! It is refreshing and leaves my skin smooth without any oily or greasy feeling. It has no scent and has not irritated my skin. I also love that it is made in the U.S. and is not tested on animals! It&#x27;s great to see a company with such fantastic values!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased that upon using Foxbrim’s Serum, my face didn’t turn a blotchy red because the formula is very gentle. I also loved the fact that this serum feels very light on the skin, yet provides the right amount of moisture that I need – not too heavy that my face feels like the aftermath of an oil slick! I use it every day under my makeup because not only does it moisturize the skin…it also promises a fresher and brighter complexion and I am definitely noticing a difference! It has also helped eradicate my fine lines and I could not be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it does a whole lot of good.  can&#x27;t tell yet.</li>
    <li> Great product. I live in a dry climate and this serum soothes my skin and makes it feel amazing. Not oily at all.</li>
    <li> I saw results in only a few days. I absolutely plan in continuing use of this product!!</li>
    <li> After using for about a month I have noticed quite a change. At 60+ years I had a bit of &amp;#34;sagging&amp;#34; of tissues along my jaw line. I can honestly say that area is much firmer now. Nothing short of plastic surgery can turn back the clock on aging, but this at least puts a stop to it.</li>
    <li> I had read about this product in a magazine. I gave it a try and have not been disappointed. The serum absorbs into your skin beautifully, and I have noticed a significant difference in the smoothness in my skin. I am 61 and I have received many compliments on my skin since I started using Amara Organics Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. Makes the skin so smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a week.  When I apply it in the morning my skin looks and feels refreshed.  My skin is defiantly glowing and I hope with time starts to work on some wrinkles.  There is a faint smell that quickly goes away .  The pump , pumps out a perfect amount for one application for me.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product. My skin looks smoother and healthier in four weeks of use. My sister in law noticed the changes right away. I recommend the serum for people with skin conditions like mine.</li>
    <li> I have used Amara Organics&#x27; Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid Serum for about six months and I am surprised -- and very, very pleased -- to say that I really notice a difference. I started using both serums when I began a routine of &amp;#34;derma-rolling.&amp;#34; The serums are non-sticky and non-oily; they don&#x27;t make me break out. That&#x27;s such a relief! Most products do. I don&#x27;t remember why I chose the Amara products in the first place. I was surfing Amazon for serums, and the price seemed right. I now apply the Vitamin C Serum first (immediately after my morning shower). The Hyaluronic Acid Serum goes on once the Vitamin C Serum sinks in, which is almost immediately. My skin looks smoother and tighter. I am a skeptic, so I almost didn&#x27;t believe it until a friend of mine asked me WHAT I&#x27;m doing because (according to her) I keep looking younger and younger. That&#x27;s a really nice compliment, and it&#x27;s one that I cannot dispute (even though I like being modest). I don&#x27;t have another explanation. The Amara products, I think, have made the difference. I really, really, really recommend them.</li>
    <li> As someone that is always on the search for products that will help with my skin issues I was excited to receive this Amara Organics Hyaluronic Acid Serum in the mail!! After trying out this hyaluronic acid serum I have to say at first I wasn&#x27;t seeing results. After continuing to use the product I starting to see more and more results in the appearance of my skin. This serum works great in my opinion my only issue I had was as someone with sensitive skin I did have a small reaction the first few times using the product but it wasn&#x27;t alarming and it seemed over time my skin got used to it. This product is said to help you say goodbye to dry, flaky skin, which I agree; it does a good job with. This serum hydrates and locks in moisture giving your skin a soft glow!! This serum is infused with powerful antioxidants vitamins C &amp; E to protect your skin from free radicals and to reverse the many different signs of aging!! This hyaluronic acid serum has many amazing benefits from: Plumping and hydrating your skin, reducing fine lines and wrinkles, locking in moisture, giving skin a dewy glow, boosts collagen production, restores skin&#x27;s natural elasticity, softening and smoothing for a more even skin tone &amp; leaves skin looking radiant and youthful!!This hyaluronic acid serum is also 100% pure vegan!! I personally liked the product even with the small reaction I had being someone with sensitive skin. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone &amp; definitely think you should treat yourself to the refreshing hydrating &amp; other effects hyaluronic acid serum offers your skin!!</li>
    <li> This  product  did not agree with me!!!  I  had an allergic reaction to my sinuses.  My sinuses are very sensitive to certain ingredients.sorry!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this for a few reasons. First, it&#x27;s organic and vegan! And made in the USA.  Isn&#x27;t that great?  Next, it is silky and smooth on my skin but not greasy.  Last it works!  My forehead wrinkles look better and my skin is glowing.</li>
    <li> I have been using Amara products for a couple of weeks now.  I like them all.  They are quick drying and very moisturizing.  I have sensitive skin and have had no problems.  I woudl recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all about taking care of my skin and was pleasantly pleased when I began seeing slight results just after a week&#x27;s use.  I&#x27;m beginning to see slight results in the diminishing (or less noticeable) lines around my eye area and even that little line you get right above the nose, between your forehead.&lt;br /&gt;This product did not leave any greasy or oily feeling and seemed to absorb very fast into my skin.  I love the packaging of the box and bottle...simple, yet attractive.  I also love the fact that no animal testing was done on this product.  I love how my skin feels hydrated and soft after using this and I plan on to continue to use this product for a very long time.</li>
    <li> It has made a positive change in my skin. After several weeks of use I notice my skin is glowing and I see a renewed fresh young glow to my skin.  I was not expecting this but it was a welcome surprise.  I use it morning and evening after I cleanse my face, neck, and upper chest area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks &amp; my skin feels amazing!! It absorbs well &amp; brightens my skin. People keep asking me if I have recently gone to a medical spa for a fancy chemical peel and nope!! It&#x27;s this bottle of fabulousness!!! I will definitely be re ordering this product.</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly. It&#x27;s been about three weeks and I see some improvement with the wrinkles on the face. I suffered from dry skin every winter before using this. This product improved my neck skin tremendously. The skin below the chin were getting thin and loose and it helped it tighten. And also I had deep lines across my neck since my 20&#x27;s and they got lighter noticeably. I started using this product with Anti Aging Face Cream Moisturizer around the same time. It keeps my skin hydrated and not greasy all day. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> I reordered. this product for my daughter to try. I have noticed a positive effect from using it so far.</li>
    <li> This serum is the first serum I have ever purchased&lt;br /&gt;and the only things I have to say about it are good things! I am&lt;br /&gt;twenty years of age and still have &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; skin, but I ordered this serum&lt;br /&gt;to take early preventative action against aging and to keep my skin looking&lt;br /&gt;as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; as I can for as long as I can. I have developed a daily skincare&lt;br /&gt;routine and this serum fits into it quite perfectly. What I love about the&lt;br /&gt;product is that there are very few ingredients, there really is no smell or&lt;br /&gt;scent, and it is neither heavy nor sticky feeling on the skin. I also love&lt;br /&gt;that the product comes with a pump to dispense the product, it really helps&lt;br /&gt;to control how much is used and makes the product last for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;I think that I have really gotten more than my money&#x27;s worth with this&lt;br /&gt;product as well. Most serums that I come across are so expensive and the&lt;br /&gt;amount of product is so little. The price I paid to purchase this product is a&lt;br /&gt;price I would be willing to pay time and time again. I can really see a&lt;br /&gt;noticeable difference. My skin looks revitalized, more awake, glowing, and&lt;br /&gt;supple. The Hyaluronic Acid Serum is already in my Amazon wishlist, ready&lt;br /&gt;to be purchased again. Keep doing what your doing Amara Organics! Me and my skin thank you!</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. I tend to have dull, lifeless, acne prone skin and have for the last 3 years. I started using this a few days ago, and I can already tell a difference with my skin. Its softer, the acne is clearing up, and there is a slight &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. Some of these serums tend to be sticky, but not this one. Smooth as silk! Def recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing product I absolutely love it my skin feels and looks amazing</li>
    <li> Ho hum. Did nothing really for my skin. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and have fine lines. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. Nice serum, smooths skin, but doesn&#x27;t do much for plumping lines.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference. Also they say to never buy Hyaluronic Acid in clear bottle as the light it dilutes the Vitamin C efficiency. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> All winter long my poor 49 year old face was dry, cracked and peeling.  I tried to even make my own lotion from just about every oil and butter known to man.  They were healthy, but didn&#x27;t do anything except add an oily layer on top of my poor cracked face.  I bought this along with Amara anti aging face cream, and FINALLY my face doesn&#x27;t resemble a potato chip anymore.  I have ultra sensitive skin on my face too and can rarely use a store bought product, but these two products agree with me completely and my face finally feels normal again.  I also think my wrinkles are less noticeable.  As much as I love making my own lotions (and I still will for my hands and body) I am sold on this stuff for my face, and will continue to use it twice a day faithfully.  Thank you Amara Organics.</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients of this product. I also use it with this vegan scrub: [...]  which are from edible plant roots. The results are awesome! I just glow glow glow!</li>
    <li> MADE IN THE USA!  There are NO parabens, alcohol or animal testing either!  When it&#x27;s time to apply the serum, try to remember to clean and dry your face first.  If you&#x27;re also using toner, apply the toner first. Then apply a small amount of serum with fingertips to your face and neck.  After the serum is dry, add a moisturizer to the same areas. This product can be used during the day or at night but if layering serums, apply the thinnest consistency first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has 100% Pure Vegan Hyaluronic Acid, which aides in hydrating the skin so fine lines and wrinkes are filled in and reduced.  It also helps lock in moisture, boost collagen production and softens the skin for a smoother tone.  This type of organic Hyaluronic Acid is derived from the seeds of the Indian plant Cassia Angustifolia. Hyaluronic Acid holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water. It draws moisture out of the environment and forms a protective, hydrating barrier on the skin.  As you can see in the ingredients, it also has antioxidants of Vitamins C &amp; E added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that the label indicates the ingredients are 98% natural and 72% organic.  I have never seen a company put that % on the label and appreciate them doing that.  Ingredients:  Deionized Aqua (Water), Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (Botanical Hyaluronic Acid), Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Wildcrafted Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Pelargonium Gravolens (Geranium Essential Oil), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Organic Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola Extract), Organic Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Plant Extract), Organic Pelargonium Graveolens (Geranium Extract), Organic Taraxacum Officinale (Dandelion Extract).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to sample and had the opportunity to share my honest thoughts about the product through posting this review.  I appreciated the discount that I was given at the time of order.</li>
    <li> I will order more...Serum does exactly as promised, my skin becomes smoother and lessens a tiny area of milia i have on my cheeks, and helps to contain it. The size and surface of the milia have even decreased! I see results after a few days of application, even though i use it only once a day! HIGHLY recommended, even price is fairly reasonnable!</li>
    <li> Great Product! I will definitely will  be purchasing again, plus too the Owner of the company is very nice and emailed me to see what I thought of the product!</li>
    <li> I love this so much !! My skin looks great it&#x27;s even cleared the dark spots on my neck from my acne and shoulders ! But I mostly use it on my face !</li>
    <li> Great product and great value for organic ingredients.....&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try....you WONT be disappointed.....!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just started using today and seems to work well..I will update my review in a few days and let you know how it&#x27;s going..</li>
    <li> Love the way this feels on my skin. Definitely softens and moisturizes. Smells nice,too.easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Wow! I am in LOVE with this line. Using it for a week now and I know there is improvement in the overall look and tone of my skin. I am about to celebrate my 30th birthday and have been noticing lately that I look rather run down and older at times than that. My skin is starting to feel thinner around my eyes and small wrinkles are creeping in steadily. After using the serum after the eye gel and before the moisturizer seems to be perfect for me This stuff is probably magic in a bottle or something. But whatever it is, my skin is loving it. It feels like it did when I turned 20.</li>
    <li> This is a great Hyaluronic acid serum with Vitamin C to plump and hydrate my skin.  Perfect to use at night after I remove my makeup.It fills in fine lines and reduces the appearance of fine lines and pores. I can see a difference after only 2 weeks of use. It is smooth and lightweight, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or gunky on your skin. A winner on its own, I also use it in conjunction with the matching moisturizer and eye cream.</li>
    <li> I seem to be doing more Christmas shopping online every year.  I purchased this product for grandma&#x27;s Christmas stocking (with some other facial products from the same company).  Every woman deserves a little pampering once and a while.  I hope she likes it!</li>
    <li> We received this product for free, the review is my own. My wife loves that this product is natural and healthy for her skin. When you review products, it is nice to know when they will not have any adverse affects. She tried this serum and she likes how it soaks into her skin. It does not leave any greasy feel or look. After she uses this serum, her skin feels healthier and more hydrated. I think this is why it removes fine lines and wrinkles. The product is made to make your face healthier, which gives you a younger and healthier look. We both appreciate that companies like this are now making products that work and are actually healthy for your skin. My wife will continue to use this product because it took nearly no time for her to feel results. My wife&#x27;s face feels softer after she uses this product and that is what she was hoping for. Why do dangerous injections, when you can get the same results from a safe product?</li>
    <li> I love that this is a plant based product. It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin. There&#x27;s a pleasant, citrus scent which dissipates quickly. It is not greasy or sticky. I use this before I use the Amara Organics Advanced Age-Defying Moisturizer. The pump dispenses the perfect amount of serum for each use. My skin feels well moisturized and super soft. I have only been using this serum for a couple of weeks and will update my review later if necessary.</li>
    <li> Not sure if they have a return policy but this serum broke me out. I have used others with no breakouts.  it must be one of the oils in this brand. Love the texture and pump bottle is very nice.  Update :  they do read the reviews and issued me a refund.  I really appreciate good customer service.  I</li>
    <li> I use this product for the lines around my mouth, and it seems to help smooth them out.  I also rub it along my jaw line and my throat.  It really helps in tightening the skin.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I will continue purchasing iy.</li>
    <li> Have seen improvements in my skin already! Fast absorbing and evens out skin tone.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR TWO WEEKS AND MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN&lt;br /&gt;GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM VERY PLEASE WITH THE APPEARANCE OF MY SKIN..., IT LOOKS MORE&lt;br /&gt;TRANSPARENT AND CLEAN...,  ALSO FEEL LIKE MY DEEPEST LINES HAVE  SOFTEN.../  I&lt;br /&gt;DIDN&#x27;T HAVE ANY BAD REACTION...!  IN GENERAL,  MY OPINION IS ABOUT THIS&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT, IS GOOD!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clara Cuervo&lt;br /&gt;Weston, Florida USA</li>
    <li> This is a great product at an exceptionally good price.</li>
    <li> None of their products actually works for fine lines. That one left my skin rough and opaque. Not good. I used the Vitamin C Serum and at least gave me glow, even though was all I noticed. Customer service never answered my emails.</li>
    <li> Using this very natural product on my neck. Feels good. Not sticky,  still too soon to see if it makes a difference</li>
    <li> Happy as can be..... This stuff is no miracle... but it does keep you moisturized.  My skin needs all the help it can get.  Very nicely packaged and feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying using this product.  it is very easy to apply and dries in a minute, leaving my face and neck feeling smooth and tight.  I then apply my moisturizer and I am off and running.  I am noticing a change in my skin and really like how the lines are fading.  If you are interested in a Hyaluronic Acid Serum I recommend you try this.</li>
    <li> Have you ever walked by a mirror and not recognized yourself?  That was where I was when I ordered this product.  I have used it once daily, there is great improvement in controlling breakouts (menopausal acne), my face is firmer and softer, and my pores are smaller.  I&#x27;ll be back for more because my bottle is half empty.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 1 month, This product has absolutely useless. I just don&#x27;t understand how why would someone sell something with fake reviews. The product and reviews are completely misleading.  Absolutely 0% effective, waste of time and waste of money. The other reviews has to be fake or paid reviews. Would never buy this company&#x27;s product again with so many fake reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I rarely buy the same product twice.  This is I have, and will continue to.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this and a few more products from this line in. I grew up in a beach area and have NOT taken very good care of my skin. I have discovered recently how much I love Hyaluronic acid. It has been a godsend and is super effective on my wrinkles and creases!! My skin feels amazing when I use this!!  I have been getting soo many comments and compliments about the quality of my skin, that I have a glow, that my face looks great- it has been wonderful! I layer this with theeye serum and the moisturizer and I feel so good and clean and bright when it is all on!!</li>
    <li> This is yet another fabulous product from Amara Organics. All natural and very refreshing, little to no smell.&lt;br /&gt;It blends well with my cosmetics and feels great at night on my face. I will be a repeat customer, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to anyone who is trying to brighten the complexion.</li>
    <li> The first quality of Amara Organics&#x27; Hyaluronic Acid Serum that really made an impression is the packaging and presentation of the product.  I love that it arrives in its own product box.  The clear glass, white label and bright color scheme makes this product look fresh and inviting.  My only concern is that dark glass is usually used to protect Vitamin C from breaking down and becoming less potent, so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump dispenses the correct amount of product for application to the face.  I find that it helps make the product last a little longer, which is always a plus!  The product itself has a clean and neutral scent.  Its texture is rich and smooth.  It feels great on the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of performance, this serum is extremely moisturizing.  Their formula does a great job of locking in moisture without causing breakouts.  My skin felt smooth and my complexion was brighter with regular use of the product.  My skin really enjoys this little treat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product for honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this, I&#x27;ve had several people comment on how &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; I look!  It&#x27;s obviously working!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen much change. Maybe it hasn&#x27;t been long enough yet.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It helps heal the discoloration on my face due to sunburn.  It&#x27;s a slow process but it works pretty good.  The company representative also sent me email on how to use the product property and she did a follow up re my use of the product.  They&#x27;re awesome.</li>
    <li> I will buy this again. My mature face likes it. It smooths out lines and helps hydrate under my eyes. This product is natural and made with love.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Gives that plump feeling as it soaks in. I really feel that it makes a difference in the feel and appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I was using this serum for Hylunia, a more expensive version of this and my face was doing wonderful. I didn&#x27;t want to pay $80 again for Hylunia. I did some research and when I saw something similar on Amazon for $15, with amazing reviews I was so excited! Sad to say I should have stuck to my&lt;br /&gt;$80 hyluranoic acid. This stuff broke my face out so bad. I have horrible tiny white heads everywhere. I stopped using it about a week and a half ago, ordered my $80 stuff and my face is finally getting back to normal. I have super sensitive oily skin, so I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s why, but this stuff wasn&#x27;t for me. I gave an extra star to my&lt;br /&gt;One star review because I got a very nice welcome email a day after I ordered my serum from the owner. She was vey nice. Too bad her product wasn&#x27;t good for my&lt;br /&gt;Skin.</li>
    <li> Have not seen even slight  improvement yet after a month</li>
    <li> Awesome product for price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried a couple different Hyaluronic Acid Serums, but this so far is my favorite.  I have seen a noticeable difference of diminishing wrinkles/fine lines since using it.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow, I wasn&#x27;t sure this would do anything, but it works really well and you can&#x27;t beat the price! You see results immediately!</li>
    <li> This is the 1st serum I&#x27;ve tried... Loving the quality and love the texture.</li>
    <li> My skin has become more supple and smoother! I am 60 years old and this serum has definitely improved my skin.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to wait longer to leave a review as I wasn&#x27;t expecting any positive changes in about a week but unfortunately I experienced some negative changes.&lt;br /&gt;My dark circles actually got worse, so bad that my 2 years old asked me what happened to my eyes. I also started getting little pimples under the skin, which I never get.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have sensitive skin, I have olive skin tone, I really had high expectations for this product seen the reviews and I was ready to buy the lotion as well ... but seen the results I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ll wait another few days avoiding to use it around my eyes and update my review if anything changes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 months now and around the 8-12 week mark, I started noticing a big difference, especially with the fine lines near my eyes. Also, my complexion looks less blotchy and more toned. I am a tough critic as I have tried many products over the years, I have sun damaged skin, and am nearing 40. This product however does the job. My husband has noticed a difference as well. I have finally found the product for my skin. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> The pump up head design is just so thoughtful. When I received it, just can&#x27;t wait to wash my face at once, and come back for two drops of serum to put on my face. The smell is just refreshing, love it, and the light weight feel is also superb. I&#x27;m a combination skin type, this serum is just so comfortable to apply on my skin. I will definitely use this serum continuously to see the result. Hope it will ease some my fine lines &amp; wrinkles for smoother, softer Skin.</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt so light and so moisturized at once!!! Rub maybe two squirts of this gel in your skin!!! Leaves you with an elastic face! My dry skin slowly faded away! I haven&#x27;t felt this good all winter! I also ditched my toner! This moisturizes without causing my face to overreact and become oily! Perfect perfect!</li>
    <li> this feels amazing!  A little bit goes long way and feels good all day.  I&#x27;m excited to see how if it changes if my face looks smoother. I will definitely purchase another bottle and use this in my daily make up routine.  -Jennie Osborne</li>
    <li> really freshening your faceb, but remember to use moisturizer right after.</li>
    <li> Contains sodium benzoate and vitamin c. Dangerous combination.</li>
    <li> I love serums, and have been trying out a few recently. I was given an opportunity to try this out. I like how it went on my face. It was nice and smooth. The only thing I am not to crazy about is the smell. However, the product does what it is told so I cannot complain.</li>
    <li> This feels very good on my face. Cool and refreshing. The dispenser works well unlike other brands. I used this on my crow&#x27;s feet. I don&#x27;t see a difference yet, but it&#x27;s very early. I will update this in the future.</li>
    <li> I like the serum. It&#x27;s light and is helping me to get rid of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing!! A little goes a long ways and I have saw a dramatic difference in my fine lines and dry skin in just a few days of using it. It is not greasy or oily and it absorbs into the skin fast.</li>
    <li> I got the hyaluronic acid serum during a promotion. I typically use higher end cosmetics such as Lancome and thought it would be a good fit.&lt;br /&gt;  It did something as I had basically a sheet of skin flake off, not sure if this is supposed to happen or if it&#x27;s too strong&lt;br /&gt;  I personally won&#x27;t purchase again but it may be a perfect fit for you.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this  under my eyes and you could feel coolness, i got this item discounted in return i am able to afford it try it and leave my unbiased opinion on it. I would have to add to this because i just can&#x27;t say what it has done because I&#x27;ve not tried it long enough</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum is by far the best wrinkle product I have ever used, I can see immediate results to my face. It&#x27;s like the serum plumps and smooths wrinkles right before your eyes, amazing.</li>
    <li> skin becomes brighter after using it</li>
    <li> This company makes very good products at reasonable prices. This product does have a citrus smell to it, so it is not fragrance free, but it doesn&#x27;t linger very long after it dries. I just started using the HA Serum so expect it to be awhile to know just how well it works for me. Nice consistency to it.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum that makes my face soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Very light scent! It&#x27;s not a strong smelling product and it&#x27;s very smooth. Doesn&#x27;t feel very oily at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet if this product works or not but I was very disappointed with the lack of serum in the tube.  Barely anything coming out of the brush when I try to appt the serum to the eyelashes.  Very disappointed in that aspects.</li>
    <li> hyaluronic acid serum is working great have been using it nightly for 4 days i can already tell a diffirence in many of the lines and wrinkles on my face this is a great product and woukd recommend anyone who has wrinkles lines etc to get this</li>
    <li> Works much better than my old vitamin c serum.  This product doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling overly tight and dry.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week.  I have seen a huge improvement in my fine line wrinkles and my customers have even noticed.  I apply in the morning and at night before bed.  My skin looks my even toned. I found my Fountain of Youth!!!</li>
    <li> Very effective.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this stuff !  The first time I put in on,  my skin seemed to just drink it up.  Oh my goodness,  I was so excited to feel the dramatic difference.  It was like the texture of my skin changed.  I worked outside for many years and that took a toll on my skin.  After a few yrs, I noticed how much drier it was and many more lines were forming.  I have tried many expensive products to no avail.  They feel greasy on my skin , don&#x27;t  absorb well, or just seem to have no effect at all.  Usually I will keep using, hoping that eventually I will see a difference,  but I rarely do.  With this product,  I noticed a dramatic difference immediately.  That first night,  I thoroughly cleansed my face and exfoliated with a brush,  then applied the product.  First thing I did the next morning was feel my sking....it was so soft.  So I went to check in the mirror  (not expecting anything) and I noticed that those fine lines were less noticeable.  It was like they were plumped...hydrated.  The last few days, my routine has been to cleanse and apply in the morning and in the evenings,  I exfoliate and apply .  I feel like my skin is improving every day now.  I am so happy with this product that I am looking to purchase some of their other products.  I was given a discount to purchase this product in exchange for a honest, unbiased review and I feel lucky to have found out about it.  I use it on my hands as well, and it instantly hydrates them.  The skin literally changes before your eyes.  That might make me use it up a little faster, but oh well.  haha.  I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
    <li> Applies easy.  A little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s only been 1 week,  so I am not sure if it works</li>
    <li> Love the stuff I use really great skincare and this is what I was missing helps my other products absorb better!!</li>
    <li> My entire household loves this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and am using my 2nd bottle of this serum. My skin has shown great improvement, the blemishes and large pores have disappeared and my face is much  smoother, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product it feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> product arrived quickly. my skin drinks it up!!! i highly recommend this product. good price too. excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> I read Hyaluronic acid was the best to fight wrinkles so i&#x27;m going to use this baby up and take before and after pics. Easy to apply and I like the feel of it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for after cleansing and before moisturizing. Helps retain moisture and elasticity of skin. A perfect addition to any ski care regimen.</li>
    <li> The winter is rough on everyone&#x27;s skin!  I struggle from the first drop in temperature until spring.  After finding this product I don&#x27;t have to worry about my face drying up and falling off my face. I now have a soft face and neck!  I no longer dread to dry air but embrace it with my bottle of Hyaluronic Serum!</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry area and my skin always feels so dry and rough.  This serum has really made a difference for me.  It is smooth and rubs in very nicely.  I love how my skin feels when I have used this serum.  A little goes a long way which is also nice.  The smell is very subtle and fresh.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> So far, this serumis amazing. It has my skin feeling refined without feeling oily or sticky. I have not had any breakouts since i started using this product. I typically have super sensitive skin, so anything new tends to break me out. but this product did not do that to my sensitive skin. The fragrance is a mild citrus which goes away shortly after applying. Highly Recommended product!!</li>
    <li> Bought this along with the Moisturizer and Eye Gel. Tried them all for a week. Actually made my face look more wrinkled. How is that possible???And then my skin broke out...and that never happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But hey, thanks, Amara Organics, for driving me back to making my own moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I look and feel better already!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference and I use it several times a day</li>
    <li> At just a fraction of the cost of department store serums, this serum from Amara Organics works just as good- maybe even better! It was delivered fast and I received it within 2 days of ordering. The serum is clear and has a light consistency. Just a few drops covers my face and neck completely. It dries pretty fast and leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean. The scent of the serum is very mild and has a very clean scent which I like a lot. My skin is sensitive, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Since using this serum two times a day on a regular basis, I can visibly see an improvement with my skin. My eye area is more toned and youthful looking. The lines near my eyes are forehead are not as noticeable. If you want fast results at a better price, you need to try this serum. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love the serum and am starting to see a brightening in my skin and the lines are starting to diminish on my forehead.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The hyaluronic acid serum has helped smooth out the roughness of my skin.</li>
