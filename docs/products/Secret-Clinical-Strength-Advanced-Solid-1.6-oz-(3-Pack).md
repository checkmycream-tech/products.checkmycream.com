      <li>I got exactly what I expected and I like that it comes in a 3 pack.</li>

      <li>ME I&#x27;M NOT VERY ACTIVE</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for those who have tried other deodorants made for sensitive skin only to find an itchy red rash appear after several days.</li>

    <li> Very expensive!  But it works great.  Still hoping to find something that works as well for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The product ingredients are good, but the consistency is not.  You turn the dial to push the product thru holes &amp; apply it to skin.  I like the solid powder form much better.</li>
    <li> have used for years and is the only one that does not irritate or cause itching. If need be you can go 2 days without applying again.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Long lasting and withstands a good workout.  Has a great scent to still give you a feminine feel.</li>
    <li> Just as described, shipped quickly. Perfect</li>

    <li> WORKS WELL, BUT GOES VERY QUICKLY. THE TUBE IS MUCH SMALLER THAN MOST AND ONCE YOU UNWRAP TO USE, ROLL BOTTOM TO PUSH UP PRODUCT TO THE TOP OF TUBE TO USE THE TUBE IS 3/4 OF THE WAY EMPTY. LUCKY FOR ME I&#x27;M NOT VERY ACTIVE AND JUST NEED CLINICAL ONE FOR MEDICAL REASONS, BUT IF I&#x27;D USE IT LIKE AN ACTIVE PERSON I CAN&#x27;T IMAGINE A TUBE LASTING MORE THAN A WEEK OR WEEK AND A HALF. BAD INGREDIENTS ARE USED SO IF IT ISN&#x27;T REALLY NEEDED I&#x27;D SUGGEST TRYING SOMETHING MORE NATURAL FIRST.</li>
    <li> This is as non-scented as you can find when it comes to deoderant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the clinical strength deoderant. I never considered myself a particularly sweaty person, but I really enjoyed the difference when I tried this - it&#x27;s worth the extra cost in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price is the most competitive I&#x27;ve found.</li>

    <li> This is the only deodorant that I&#x27;m not allergic to! Highly recommended for those who have tried other deodorants made for sensitive skin only to find an itchy red rash appear after several days.</li>
    <li> I was breaking out from everything. This product works and keeps you smelling fresh.</li>
