      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I have always loved Pearl Drops tooth polish.</li>
      <li>This whitens better and faster than any whitening paste I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>Love this..</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see it in the drug stores or grocery stores any more.</li>
      <li>I tried both because I had used the Pearl Drops paste years ago and was glad to find it again.</li>
      <li>Feels much better than just using toothpaste</li>
      <li>Now we all have really nice, clean looking teeth.</li>
      <li>i used to use it years ago when it was more available at any number of retailers.</li>
      <li>This works better than the original paste if you can beleive that.  </li>
      <li>Nice fresh feeling in you mouth- Very fast service !!</li>
      <li>Love how it gets my teeth clean.  </li>
      <li>I also like the wintergreen flavor, its not overly strong like ultrabrite, and is not as meek as crest.  </li>
      <li>Very nice to be able to use the product that seemed to have disappeared from American shelves.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s the mica that makes your teeth smooth like you went to the dentist and had your teeth cleaned like Old School.</li>
      <li>That one was white, pasty and gritty and I loved it.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t run out too fast.</li>
      <li>Not the stuff I used in high school.</li>
      <li>The taste is great and it shines my real teeth (and the fake ones, too!)</li>
      <li>I ended up buying enough for my whole family.</li>
      <li>All it is, is tooth paste that is a nice minty taste but not worth the high price when a lot less money can buy the same at Wal-Mart.</li>
      <li>Somewhere in between and gives a baking powder fine polish finish without the icky taste.</li>
      <li>but it still stands upside down where the paste is always ready to come out.</li>
      <li>I only use pearl drops once a week and use normal toothpaste the other days</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought that this might be the Pearl Drops I used back in the 70&#x27;s but it is not.  That one was white, pasty and gritty and I loved it.  This product is a bluish gel - no grit.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> Like always thank you</li>
    <li> Pearl drops did not have as much cleaning or tooth polish as the pearl drops I had used in the past.</li>
    <li> Everything went as it should.</li>
    <li> I do not use this product for whitening, I use them for cleaning between dental cleanings. This product is awesome when you have that &amp;#34;fuzzy teeth&amp;#34; feeling between dental cleanings. It will get that yucky feeling off your teeth!</li>
    <li> I have always loved Pearl Drops tooth polish. It&#x27;s the mica that makes your teeth smooth like you went to the dentist and had your teeth cleaned like Old School. Now they just spray water jet and don&#x27;t polish anymore. Anyway it&#x27;s the best product</li>
    <li> I used Pearl Drops when I was a kid but I thought they had stopped making it. I didn&#x27;t see it in the drug stores or grocery stores any more. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon!!!  The taste is great and it shines my real teeth (and the fake ones, too!) just like I remember from when I was a kid. They have changed the packaging a little but it still stands upside down where the paste is always ready to come out.</li>
    <li> I used this product to clean the head lights on my car and truck. The plastic lense and it a good job</li>
    <li> Works almost instantly! I only use pearl drops once a week and use normal toothpaste the other days so I don&#x27;t run out too fast. I ended up buying enough for my whole family. Now we all have really nice, clean looking teeth. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very nice to be able to use the product that seemed to have disappeared from American shelves.</li>
    <li> My bad.  I don&#x27;t like gel anything.  It doesn&#x27;t whiten as well as the original</li>
    <li> Was hoping to find the Pearl Drops I loved but alas it was not meant to be.  All it is, is tooth paste that is a nice minty taste but not worth the high price when a lot less money can buy the same at Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I used this for years but since it&#x27;s off the drugstore shelves I&#x27;ve missed it.  Appreciate having the opportunity to buy it because this does a great job in concert with my regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Love this.. you cannot improve perfection.  I sometimes switch out with Rembrant, but my teeth are so white and shiny with this .. been using it for years.  I also like the wintergreen flavor, its not overly strong like ultrabrite, and is not as meek as crest.  Somewhere in between and gives a baking powder fine polish finish without the icky taste. Yay pearl drops!</li>
    <li> With the Amazon&#x27;s disclaimer regarding manufacturers changing ingredients I would say this is the case. There is no substance in the polish as it immediately melts down like baking soda and water. I see no brightening effects and I only drink one cup of coffee a day.</li>
    <li> This whitens better and faster than any whitening paste I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve bought expensive ones too!</li>
    <li> Good product. Very refreshing and tastes great. Feels much better than just using toothpaste</li>
    <li> i couldn&#x27;t find this product or any variety of it ANYWHERE. i used to use it years ago when it was more available at any number of retailers. works beautifully. my dentist swears i&#x27;m seeing some other hygienist to keep my teeth so bright and clean. the price is a little steep compared to a few years ago but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff for cleaning and polishing teeth I recommend using it for this purpose! save money by doing this instead of visiting a Dentist office. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Great product..  No tubes to squeeze or store..</li>
    <li> This works better than the original paste if you can beleive that.  I tried both because I had used the Pearl Drops paste years ago and was glad to find it again.</li>
    <li> Not the stuff I used in high school. No grit.</li>
    <li> yuck not what i remember using years ago</li>
    <li> Just normal ol&#x27; toothpaste, nothing special about it, been using it for a mounth or so now, and can&#x27;t tell a differance.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Nice fresh feeling in you mouth- Very fast service !!</li>
    <li> Gel is great!  Love how it gets my teeth clean.  Shipping costs is outrageous!  It is per bottle not per shipment!  I wish product was still sold in the United States!</li>
