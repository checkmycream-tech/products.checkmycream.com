    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I have been loosing my hair for a long time now. I had started using Nioxin and saw a difference and wanted to try a new shampoo advertised on tv so stopped the Nioxin with in a year I had lost all the regrowth plus some. I will never stop using Nioxin again. It really does work for me.</li>
    <li> I had bought #3 and this time I bought #4.  Even better.  My hair was looking and feeling thin.&lt;br /&gt;This product as improved the feel of the hair.  It&#x27;s not thicker, but it is more manageable and&lt;br /&gt;I can style my hair to cover the really thin areas.  It has a very potent and cool pepperminty odor.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Hair feels much healthier.</li>
    <li> This product has really helped my hair from not falling out like it used to.  I like the minty smell it gives.  It does what it proposes in the directions.</li>
    <li> Based on my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation, I started this product.  I believe it helps with less breakage and my hair looks and  feels fuller after I blow dry.  I shampoo every other day.</li>
    <li> Seen a difference after one week! Used with scalp therapy and treatment.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I try anything else. Great shampoo and conditioner that has helped my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning and looked dry and lifeless.  After just a few shampoos and conditioning, my hair quality has greatly improved.</li>
    <li> I just used this product for the 1st time today,mnut I am hoping it does every it is purported to do.  I am desperate to find something that will stop my hair loss and make what I do have look thicker!</li>
    <li> Minimizes loss of hair in just one use.  May be a little drying, but have only used it a couple of times.</li>
    <li> You can feel your scalp tingle.</li>
    <li> Product Received quicklyu</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner. I have long hair and I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s getting any thicker or not, but my hair has at least the appearance of being somewhat thicker.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 6 months now. I also incorporate Biotin as a supplement. I have noticed a major improvement! Have gone from visually balding on top to filled in.</li>
    <li> My hair is much fuller with new growth since I started using this product about six months ago on the advice of my hair stylist.  I had noticeable thinning before this.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of thinning on the top of my head and was starting to think I was going to end up wear wigs.  But since starting to use the system I have seen a thickening of my hair and now a couple months later I can honestly say I can barely even tell where it was thin originally.  I wish I would have taken before and after pictures to post.  This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> I was using the wrong number and this #4 is just right</li>
    <li> Love it ,It&#x27;s great !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have only had product for 6 days, so can not give a review as to whether it it does what it is suppose to do. However the scent is great!</li>
    <li> Great product at great price</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised and expected. So far I am impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this shampoo and conditioner set after I noticed my hair was thinning a bit on the left side of my part. I&#x27;ve been using the product since December 2014. At first, I didn&#x27;t notice much hair growth, BUT I did notice a lot less hair shedding in the shower. Now, after using the Nioxin system for two and a half months I&#x27;m finally noticing some hair re-growth in the place where my hair was thinning. So no, this is not an immediate solution to hair loss, but this system does work after prolonged usage and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Going to number Two. Good stuff wrong choice...still not bad</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and falling a lot . I am using the Nixon my hair is growing longer , so let&#x27;s say I have to watch and see if it will get thicker . It&#x27;s too early to say if it really works . Thanks Bibi .</li>
    <li> I saw a huge difference in my hair. It gave my hair great body and my scalp was clean. I am going to keep using it. I also felt less hair breakage with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
