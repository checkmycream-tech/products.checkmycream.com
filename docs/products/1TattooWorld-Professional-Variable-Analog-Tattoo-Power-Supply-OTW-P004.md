      <li>I&#x27;m glad that was the case.</li>
      <li>Would get 5 stars if it was new like it said but it was used, but it works great.</li>
      <li>but all I really  need for this one is a good ear for tuning</li>
      <li>easy to read gauges.</li>
      <li>this machine makes me feel comfortable  </li>
      <li>Seems very well made; excellent value, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it yet, but it seems like a really good product so far.</li>
      <li>but yet again it broke with in the first hour of my tattoo session and now neither of them works!!</li>
      <li>Power is nice and steady.</li>
      <li>Worked 10 times better then the first one, which was just horrid.</li>
      <li>It looks pretty, that&#x27;s for sure -</li>
      <li>Works better than the first one we had that came with guns we bought.</li>
      <li>So far ive had 5, my 2 Monster Point analogs are the ones I like &amp; trust most!</li>
      <li>arrived quickly, great quality, everything I expected.</li>
      <li>I personally think its almost as easy to read the analog display but to each their own.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s incredibly easy to use and know exactly where you need to be depending on what tattoo you&#x27;re doing.</li>
      <li>Starting to like this power supply more and more with every use.</li>
      <li>The whole thing stutters and doesn&#x27;t give steady power so it leaves the needle hanging in the &#x27;skin&#x27; of whatever I&#x27;m tattooing and catching.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this box yet but it is the best looking I have visually seen for a long time.</li>
      <li>Everything arrived okay and looks fine, about the quality you&#x27;d expect for the price, but the power supply definitely does not work.</li>
      <li>I use rotary machines and this item is very reliable and runs smoothly.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and the packaging was secure.</li>
      <li>the peddle is well worth it.</li>
      <li>, this is by far one of my favorite machines</li>
      <li>I simply love the heck out of this powerful micro giant!</li>
      <li>Love it so far, sturdy and appears to be a very well built machine, we shall see</li>
      <li>.it stays steady, no fluxuation, and it doesnt warm up like lesser quality machines.</li>
      <li>but the box it came in was pretty stable</li>
      <li>consistent power.</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t used it many times, but it is functioning properly.</li>
      <li>The pedal gets hot, to the point I received a burn from it.</li>
      <li>This exact power supply came with my tattoo kit...and it started smoking after an hour of being used.</li>
      <li>Maybe send one that works in the first place?</li>
      <li>it was the first thing that came out of the package...</li>
      <li>Works as good as any more expensive machine.</li>
      <li>Two of those uses were to tune my guns and it stopped working during its first real session.</li>
      <li>This is a strong power supply and holds constant voltage during use.</li>
      <li>Pure garbage out of the box and didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
      <li>Very sensitive, powerful and ultra steady!</li>
      <li>All the other reviews made me feel confident in purchasing this item but now that I have purchased two of them and they have both broke within my first session of me tattooing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to use and doesn&#x27;t seem to get a good connection.</li>
      <li>I only used it once only because I&#x27;m so used to my old one, but this works great, arrived fast, can&#x27;t wait to put the old power unit away and set this one up.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about it for tattoos, but cheap enough to try.</li>
      <li>This inexpensive box really puts out sufficient power.</li>
      <li>and so far its proven its worth.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be doing more future business with one tattoo world!</li>
      <li>it stayed steady power</li>
      <li>i generally only use it for lining , only because i have more then one machine for the job.</li>
      <li>I mainly got this to practice, not tattoo on a living person.</li>
      <li>This is the second power machine I&#x27;ve purchased just like this from here and just like the first one it broke on my first session</li>
      <li>Give em a try, I highly recomment them over the competition...</li>
      <li>The power supply is absolutely fantastic, the cords that come with it on the other had, (cord to the tattoo machine and pedal cord) were absolute junk when I got them.</li>
      <li>The voltage doesn&#x27;t hold steady, the LEDs in the display don&#x27;t work right, and it isn&#x27;t actually grounded.</li>
      <li>It does not keep consistent power, power level readings are not accurate and it is very clearly cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Ive got a few sifferent power supplies now &amp; though you may think just because one may have an lcd screen its better, that isnt always the case.</li>
      <li>I had to cut and splice and add new connecters to fix them.</li>
      <li>just took a day longer than the expected date is all but its cool</li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife to replace her old one</li>
      <li>and it came really early</li>
      <li>They are heavy duty, American &amp; has a fuse in back which is more likely to blow than the unit itself.</li>
      <li>I hope to order again soon in the near future!</li>
      <li>The pedal cord ripped from the pedal the first time I picked it up and also the spring cable, half of the wires were exposed and corroded  Wichita</li>
      <li>stayed steady never bogged down,and I put some mag&#x27;s on it,never backed down.</li>

<li> Awesome machine, I ended up having to buy a really terrible one about a year ago, changing the setting was ridiculous, you really could not hear the difference in the wattage, with this machine you can hear it changing</li>
<li> Far as the flat petals carry them to the dump, I&#x27;ve never had one to work like they suppose to, they are a waste metal in the tattoo dept.</li>
<li> Still works the same  year half  later</li>
<li> Its hard to feel because its so flat and also wasn&#x27;t giving the gun the oomph it needed, after purchasing a new foot pedal</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other low cost power and they haven&#x27;t stood up at all!</li>
<li> : Just got an email from the seller asking me to delete the negative feedback in return for sending me a new power supply.</li>
<li> Very powerful and has no issues cutting out or bogging down.</li>
<li> Extremely well built.</li>
<li> this little box kicks ass,i run around twenty tuned machines up and all twenty</li>
<li> Been using this machine awhile and it hasn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
<li> You get what you pay for so don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
<li> I think its a luck thing that my machine stopped working after just a few uses.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a small box but weighs a lot.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Short circuits sometimes and I was disappointed that it did not work as well as I thought.</li>
    <li> Works as good as any more expensive machine. Very powerful and has no issues cutting out or bogging down. Would definitely recommend. Will definitely be doing more future business with one tattoo world!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! :) great product and fast shipping. :)</li>
    <li> This exact power supply came with my tattoo kit...and it started smoking after an hour of being used. So now I&#x27;m looking for another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other low cost power and they haven&#x27;t stood up at all! Been using this machine awhile and it hasn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
    <li> Used it for about 9hrs of work and the thing stopped workin its junk never again will i nor anyone i know buy this item</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got a very snazzy look to it, it works great.</li>
    <li> Works but that is about all that can be said for this. It does not keep consistent power, power level readings are not accurate and it is very clearly cheaply made. You get what you pay for so don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> I def would recommend this product, it came fast, works awesome. my only issue was the foot pedal. Its hard to feel because its so flat and also wasn&#x27;t giving the gun the oomph it needed, after purchasing a new foot pedal it was on!</li>
    <li> Husband is making the art on body look bad ass. We will be tattoo white trash couple before you know it!</li>
    <li> I still use this as my daily driver. I&#x27;ve had it for... Iono... Maybe about 6 months. Power is nice and steady.</li>
    <li> This was a \\&quot;my-bad\\&quot; order. This is a good power supply...the peddle is well worth it. However, I wasn&#x27;t paying attention when I clicked...So, my bad. I decided to keep as a backup though. I plugged it in and tinkered with it. It kept my liner in tune. I recommend this power supply to have on hand. This was my mistake, and had nothing to so with the seller. The shipping was fast and the packaging was secure.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this machine as it as well as the seller has great reviews. I think its a luck thing that my machine stopped working after just a few uses. Two of those uses were to tune my guns and it stopped working during its first real session. Im sad I cant exchange it :( Im only rating it at a two because of the machine not because of customer service. Again, I think its a luck thing *sigh*</li>
    <li> Just got this today and it works so great I mean I would have payed this price for the foot pedal alone.</li>
    <li> Love it so far, sturdy and appears to be a very well built machine, we shall see</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to replace her old one and it is just great. The price was also hard to beat.</li>
    <li> Quit.working after five mins of use wastr of money</li>
    <li> analog is the way to go. this machine runs everything great. i generally only use it for lining , only because i have more then one machine for the job. this machine makes me feel comfortable  .it stays steady, no fluxuation, and it doesnt warm up like lesser quality machines. keep in mind this machine will only run one machine at a time.</li>
    <li> Awesome machine, I ended up having to buy a really terrible one about a year ago, changing the setting was ridiculous, you really could not hear the difference in the wattage, with this machine you can hear it changing and it&#x27;s incredibly easy to use and know exactly where you need to be depending on what tattoo you&#x27;re doing. Really happy with my purchase. Package came in great condition, no bubble wrap or anything but the box it came in was pretty stable and I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Had to fix the power supply</li>
    <li> This is a strong power supply and holds constant voltage during use. I use rotary machines and this item is very reliable and runs smoothly.</li>
    <li> Works better than the first one we had that came with guns we bought.</li>
    <li> awesome machine steady power and did not miss a beat, this is by far one of my favorite machines</li>
    <li> Hey the product was great.</li>
    <li> This is just what was needed. Worked 10 times better then the first one, which was just horrid. Glad i found it!</li>
    <li> The power supply is absolutely fantastic, the cords that come with it on the other had, (cord to the tattoo machine and pedal cord) were absolute junk when I got them. The pedal cord ripped from the pedal the first time I picked it up and also the spring cable, half of the wires were exposed and corroded  Wichita was shorting it out. I had to cut and splice and add new connecters to fix them. But the reason I got this was for the power supply and I have yet to have any problems. The cords need to be better quality thiugh.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly, great quality, everything I expected.</li>
    <li> this little box kicks ass,i run around twenty tuned machines up and all twenty it stayed steady power,the power volt never moved, then I did a tattoo with it,and it held it&#x27;s on the volts stayed steady never bogged down,and I put some mag&#x27;s on it,never backed down. Far as the flat petals carry them to the dump, I&#x27;ve never had one to work like they suppose to, they are a waste metal in the tattoo dept. I recommend this power box a 100%</li>
    <li> Perfect! 10/10 Good Power Supply!</li>
    <li> This is the second power machine I&#x27;ve purchased just like this from here and just like the first one it broke on my first session I bought a second one thinking maybe it was just bad luck but yet again it broke with in the first hour of my tattoo session and now neither of them works!! I recommend going a different route&#x27; I just wish I could get my money back... All the other reviews made me feel confident in purchasing this item but now that I have purchased two of them and they have both broke within my first session of me tattooing I now know that this is not a good product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it yet, but it seems like a really good product so far. I can&#x27;t wait to fire this thing up!</li>
    <li> I mainly got this to practice, not tattoo on a living person. I&#x27;m glad that was the case. It looks pretty, that&#x27;s for sure - but it doesn&#x27;t work well at all. The pedal gets hot, to the point I received a burn from it. It&#x27;s hard to use and doesn&#x27;t seem to get a good connection. The whole thing stutters and doesn&#x27;t give steady power so it leaves the needle hanging in the &#x27;skin&#x27; of whatever I&#x27;m tattooing and catching. I never returned it, I still pull it out every now and again. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Would get 5 stars if it was new like it said but it was used, but it works great. No problem yet</li>
    <li> Still works the same  year half  later</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this box yet but it is the best looking I have visually seen for a long time. It is built extremely solid. It&#x27;s a small box but weighs a lot. I will update this post after I use it.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the tattoo machine. The machine works very&lt;br /&gt;good. I hope to order again soon in the near future!</li>
    <li> Seems very well made; excellent value, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this machine I didn&#x27;t expect it to come with a foot pedal but it&#x27;s just what I needed and it came really early so that is a plus over all it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> Starting to like this power supply more and more with every use. I was into digitals in the past but all I really  need for this one is a good ear for tuning and so far its proven its worth. I&#x27;m satisfied with the order 100%....just took a day longer than the expected date is all but its cool</li>
    <li> This power supply is awesome! Very sensitive, powerful and ultra steady! Extremely well built. Price is a steal! Get one</li>
    <li> I use it for a testing 12v power source because I can control the voltage.  I even had a back feed and still works. I don&#x27;t know about it for tattoos, but cheap enough to try.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived okay and looks fine, about the quality you&#x27;d expect for the price, but the power supply definitely does not work. Also, the DVD is hilarious, so there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Just got an email from the seller asking me to delete the negative feedback in return for sending me a new power supply. Uh, no, the people need to know. Maybe send one that works in the first place?</li>
    <li> I only used it once only because I&#x27;m so used to my old one, but this works great, arrived fast, can&#x27;t wait to put the old power unit away and set this one up.</li>
    <li> I simply love the heck out of this powerful micro giant! I has plenty of power to crank out. thank you !</li>
    <li> This thing is a piece of crap. The voltage doesn&#x27;t hold steady, the LEDs in the display don&#x27;t work right, and it isn&#x27;t actually grounded. Save your money and get a good one. This thing is garbage.</li>
    <li> Ive got a few sifferent power supplies now &amp; though you may think just because one may have an lcd screen its better, that isnt always the case. I personally think its almost as easy to read the analog display but to each their own. This inexpensive box really puts out sufficient power. If you do buy a digital display model I would recommend a Monster Point. They are heavy duty, American &amp; has a fuse in back which is more likely to blow than the unit itself. So far ive had 5, my 2 Monster Point analogs are the ones I like &amp; trust most! Give em a try, I highly recomment them over the competition...</li>
    <li> Pure garbage out of the box and didn&#x27;t even work. Returned to supplier and still no refund almost a year later.</li>
    <li> Why does my machines only run on 15v ,it overheats my guns alot!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and man it was the first thing that came out of the package... HA, HA,&lt;br /&gt; Thank you</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it many times, but it is functioning properly. consistent power. easy to read gauges.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I order two one didn&#x27;t  work so  I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Junk. Do yourself a favor and skip this product.</li>
    <li> trashed my digital power supply after this came in lol great piece of equipment good job guys</li>
</ol>
