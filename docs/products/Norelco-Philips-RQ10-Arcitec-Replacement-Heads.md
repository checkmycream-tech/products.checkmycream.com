    <li> 2nd time to tell you that this product work great.  Easy to purchase from Amazon and fast de.</li>
    <li> perfect fit first time. Makes a wonderful difference in shaving comfort.</li>
    <li> What can I say?...I&#x27;ve been using this product for some years now. It works.&lt;br /&gt;I believe the manufactured recommends changing shaving blades yearly. From my experience, one needs to plan to change blades every 6 months.</li>
    <li> 1st replacement in 10 years!</li>
    <li> Not as good as originl but is ok.</li>
    <li> After receiving the replacement Arcitec heads, installation was easy. The shave made for a much smoother face. All in all, I am quite pleased on getting the product quickly,and will order again when the blades need to replaced.</li>
    <li> This products is truly fantastic.  My mother bought it for his birthday and he says it is the best present he has received from her.  He highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> The seller and I have agreed to do a compromise relating to my original feedback.  The seller was concerned re: the feedback I provided which, to the seller&#x27;s credit, was interested enough in the product to respond to me.  The seller is an honest person and that&#x27;s why I wanted to correct my original feedback.  And yes, I will do business with the seller in the future.</li>
    <li> I use the Philips Arcitec daily. I am a Philips [Norelco] user since 1960. My most loyal Companion for 50 years!</li>
    <li> Very expensive; a lot more expensive than the last time i purchase blades 1 1/2 years ago..</li>
    <li> getting replacement heads for my shaver was a good thing. It is like buying a brand new shaver. you should change heads at least once a year.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades came as advertised and when advertised. I have had this razor for almost 10 years and replace the blades when needed, usually every 3 to 4 months. I have a very heavy beard (I could shave twice a day to keep my face smooth) and this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> This product is all it should be. My old blades were not bad after four years.  The new blades are great.</li>
    <li> great to get a replacement head and not get a whole new razor.  Works perfectly and hopefully will last a long time!</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I needed to update my shaver.  Why buy a newer less effective item when you can buy the replacement heads from Amazon and install them yourself within minutes.  A good buy and a great product.</li>
    <li> they were on time and were what we expected thanks for the great product this is really a good thing</li>
    <li> My shaver is only a few years old, but this replacement head has disappeared from the retail stores where I used to buy it. I think the stores figure if they don&#x27;t stock it any more, people will have to invest in a new shaver that parts are available for. Fooled them, it&#x27;s available on Amazon</li>
    <li> I get a replacement head for my Norelco every year.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> Norelco makes superior products.&lt;br /&gt;As expected, this shaver head is excellent.  I didn&#x27;t realize how dull the previous head was until my first shave with the new one.  I replace the head about once a year.</li>
    <li> Fits perfect--good for another year--Make sure you get the Norelco BRAND---Lot of cheap knock offs that do not work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about three (3) years and this is my 2nd replacement.. I really Love it!! A Very Comfortable Shave, I Highly recommend This One!!</li>
    <li> Way too expensive !!  I should have bought a new razer instead.  Dissatisfied with the price....but the service was great!</li>
    <li> Excellent electric razor for about 3 months. Then it starts to wear down and you either chop up your face or you buy a new attachment of blades. Gets expensive after awhile.</li>
    <li> all was 1st class except dely by post office, was lost in transit and resent to po bx instead of rual rout then was ok</li>
    <li> TECHNICALLY OK, BUT THE PRICE IS OUTRAGEOUS!!</li>
    <li> Product works fine. New as advertised. Product was hard to find in stores. Price was satisfactory. Would buy again from this source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I have  been using this razor for the last three years and would not have another. The replacement heads continue  to satisfy me!</li>
    <li> My husband can make a replacement head last 6 months. He loves his close shave, and so do I. Thanks! I want to buy more ASAP to keep on hand in case these get harder to order.</li>
    <li> I had to have this product for my razor to function properly for without it, it would not work.  I do recommend this product to anyone...</li>
    <li> This item replaced the current heads on my Norelco shaver. The replacement was simple and easy.  The heads were sharp and worked like the original. I have had no problems with this product and I would recommend it to anyone whose electric shaver heads are getting dull. Make sure to check the model number of your shaver before ordering to ensure compatibility.</li>
    <li> as always, Great Service</li>
    <li> Perfect for my application.</li>
    <li> Once you use the replacement heads you wonder why did I wait so long to replace them. I feel the difference</li>
    <li> Very useful accessory for my Arcitec shaver</li>
    <li> These heads matched my razor to a tee. Replacng the old ones was a snap. I immediately found out why I ordered them in the first place: I had a marvelous experience shaving again. New blades help, duh?</li>
    <li> The replacement heads do not shave as close or as good as the original heads that I have used for over a year.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads were easy to replace&lt;br /&gt;and need to be replace ever so often.  The shaver&lt;br /&gt;heads were made for my Norelco shaver and work&lt;br /&gt;fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver heads. I have been using the Norelco razor for years.  The only hold back is that the blades seem to get dull to fast.</li>
    <li> My husband was thrilled to find these on Amazon. His razor is like new again! We could not find replacements for these any where! Thank you Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Shaver works like new again. Shave is close and smooth like it was when I bought it. This replacement head works better than the last one I got. Fits more snuggly on the shaver.</li>
    <li> Great company. Husband loves the nice shave he gets. Will stick with Norelco for all future shavers. Highly recommended this item.</li>
    <li> very good price for this product</li>
    <li> I (unscientifically) found that these replacement heads needed about a week of break-in before they really started working well. After a week my shaves were closer---and I found that my shaving time had gone down. Less repeated passes, I guess. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> My Husband will have to answer this one also later He is not available right now Just send un these last two items  a nother time later</li>
    <li> Even though my razor is 2 years plus in age. This item restored it back to new.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves great just like I remember when I originally purchased the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> What can I say about razor heads?  It is recommended by the manufacturer.  It works fine.  It is just a razor head!</li>
    <li> Had the Norelco Arcitec shaver for two years before buying the replacement heads.  Definitely noticed the difference.  Big improvement in shaving quality.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for several years and it performs well however the cost of replacement heads ($52.00 through Amazon, can&#x27;t find heads locally) compels me to shop for an alternitive. I am 84 years old and live on a fixed income.</li>
    <li> The replacement head provided a very close shave.  Also it seems to extend the battery life.</li>
    <li> We could not find this replacement head anywhere but online, so we were forced to order it sight unseen on line.&lt;br /&gt;It wasand a delivered in the time repersented it would be and appeared to be perfect.  However after a few days of use, we notice that it does not stay on securely to the razor itself. When just holding it to clean - it pops off!  Really,? Hoping that it just doesn&#x27;t pop off while I&#x27;m shaving!! A little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t fit as snuggly and securly as the original, but other than that it shaves well!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works as advertised. Make razor like new. The price was a little steep but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great cheaper than in the store i will purchase this again if the price is right.i hope you keep this in stock. it should last two years before i have to get a new one</li>
    <li> My husband had this razor for about 2 years and he asked me to order replacement heads.  Replacement heads improved the function of the razor.</li>
    <li> This head was not much sharper than the head I replaced. Previous replacement was excellent. Very disappointed in this head.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for over 5 years and will continue using it for as long as I need them,</li>
    <li> The new blades did no better a job than the four year old ones they replaced.  I should have saved my money.</li>
    <li> the replacement head has become very expensive</li>
    <li> Always good to an extra head on hand. Most of the times I keep at least two on hand to be sure</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t . It was junk, not properly quality checked and was returned. One of the cutter heads would not engage&lt;br /&gt;CB</li>
    <li> did not realize how dull my old norelco razer head was. when the head warning light came on (didn&#x27;t remember it had one) i was like whats up?? my new head was easy to order arrived very quickly and i now get very close shave&lt;br /&gt;for a quarter of the price of a new shaver.</li>
    <li> This purchase allows my faithful Norelco razor to continue to serve me faithfully as it has the past 4-5 years.</li>
    <li> Although expensive, these cutter heads are excellent and provide the close shave Norelco is known for. They last a year or two, and are easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> Did the job as advertised. Nice service</li>
    <li> The old head on my razor wasn&#x27;t doing the job anymore. Glad I replaced it.</li>
    <li> fast delivery well recieved</li>
    <li> What I expected and ordered.  These razors only work decently if the heads are maintained and replaced every couple of years.</li>
    <li> Necessary tune up for the norelco shaver.  I have owned the Norelco shavers for years and they all really need new shaving heads, at least every year. The Amazon price was a little high this time.</li>
    <li> This is &amp;#34;national back-ordered,&amp;#34; it says, with early June delivery.  Well, it is no longer early June and I still don&#x27;t have it.  For an organization like Phillips to be out of stock on of of their important products demonstrates really poor inventory control and planning.  To say I&#x27;m disappointed -- have using Norelco&#x27;s for over 55 years -- would be a huge understatement.</li>
    <li> I can keep may Norelco another year............</li>
    <li> The original blades that came with my Arcitec razor lasted a good long time. All three of the replacement heads I bought did not last as long, and all of them had a habit of falling off as I was using the razor. Is there some unknown trick to get these things to stay on once you replace them? I love the idea that all you need do is replace the razor head without having to fumble with the small parts separately, but the product needs great improvement.</li>
    <li> They attached to the razor like new, and they work fine. What else can I say about a new razor head?</li>
