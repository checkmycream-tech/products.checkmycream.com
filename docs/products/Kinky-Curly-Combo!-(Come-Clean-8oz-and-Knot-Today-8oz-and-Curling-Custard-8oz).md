      <li>Best product so far.  </li>
      <li>I really really LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I use it more in my daughters&#x27; hair than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>these are refills for us we love the product</li>
      <li>I guess the nappier the better.  </li>
      <li>Love It.</li>
      <li>I still however recommend this product if you want your curls to be more defined.</li>
      <li>This product is okay.</li>
      <li>I love my hair every time that I use it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of these products, and the detangler conditioner does what it is suppose to....</li>
      <li>I love the Knot Today and the Curling custard.</li>
      <li>This product was made to love my hair.</li>
      <li>Works great on 4b curl pattern which is very course.</li>
      <li>my hair is SOFT, SHINY, BOUNCY, AND GORGEOUS!  </li>
      <li>The products themselves are fine</li>
      <li>The best part of this trio might be the shampoo because it s not super drying and smells nice, but I&#x27;d really bought this for the conditioner and custard.</li>
      <li>Instead I would suggest purchasing the Moraccan Oil Intensive Treatment and Garnier Curl Sculpting Cream Gel (both available through Amazon).</li>
      <li>I lightly rinsed out the Knot Today before applying the Curling Custard.</li>
      <li>Shampoo - it cleans my hair differently than i&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
      <li>Fabulous job.</li>
      <li>Today is absolutely FANTASTIC for detangling and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>The leave in is such a great conditioner-</li>
      <li>But I still have the original conditioner and leave-in.</li>
      <li>(curls lasted the week), but as my natural hair began growing in, the rollers were not as effective.  </li>
      <li>But the Curling Custard wins the prize.</li>
      <li>these are worth buying &amp; stocking up your cabinet with.</li>
      <li>It not only keeps my hair soft, but my curls stay looking great all day.</li>
      <li>Makes hair nice and curly but leaves a white residue on hair.</li>
      <li>I have not used it during the summer, so it will be interesting to see how it holds up in southern humidity.</li>
      <li>sure you don&#x27;t put too much on (you won&#x27;t know until your hair has white scoobies in it).  </li>
      <li>The custard gel is smooth, and it is nice to use only one styling product on my hair &amp; not a combine a bunch of other products to keep my hair together.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t entirely due to the length of my hair either as I&#x27;ve used much smaller amounts of better products and have gotten better results.</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t like the way my hands feel afterwards (very sticky).  </li>
      <li>I gave it three stars, however, because the leave in conditioner and curling custard work really well for a twist out.  </li>
      <li>my daughter has really curly hair and this has made her curls bouncy and glossy even in the 10 degree weather</li>
      <li>but it held my curls so that didn&#x27;t bother me too much.  </li>
      <li>It really works!&lt;br /&gt;I used the conditioner as a leave in</li>
      <li>However, these did not do much for my hair.</li>
      <li>I just have to comb through my hair really well.</li>
      <li>The knot today really softens my hair and adds moisture</li>
      <li>It distributes really well.</li>
      <li>My loose s-curl patterned hair that so easily frizzes was defined, tamed, and controlled.</li>
      <li>I think this product would work better with wavy or slightly curly hair.</li>
      <li>but since I had the CC in I skipped the use of towel) GORGEOUS curl definition, like I have NEVER experienced...</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s given me much much much better results with far less product.</li>
      <li>More is not better - Make</li>
      <li>The Come Clean shampoo is average, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>It worked as I expected on coarse hair (mine), but not at all on soft, fine hair (</li>
      <li>The curling custard defines my hair like no other and it&#x27;s not hard or crusty.</li>
      <li>I bought this to curl the natural hair while I continued to roll the permed hair.  </li>
      <li>I like that its all natural</li>
      <li>I was going from permed to natural hair</li>
      <li>She has natural hair and it makes her hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>She was not able to replicate my hair style but uses it to curl her lightly textured hair.</li>
      <li>You can comb right through the mounds of curls without a single tangle!!!</li>
      <li>it is hard to find styling products that are gluten free....</li>
      <li>My hair is so hard to comb out after I wash it with the Knot Clean Shampoo and Knot Today</li>
      <li>The shampoo and leave-in conditioner had my hair soft, but the curling custard left a white film on my hair and it was sticky.  </li>
      <li>I never realized how much oils held my hair down before using this product.  </li>
      <li>The curling cream left my hair pretty stiff.</li>
      <li>The overall four star rating is due to the shampoo which is nothing special, in my humble opinion.</li>
      <li>depending on how wet my hair is, it can dry a little crunchy, but all you have to do is crunch your curls with your hands, and the hardness goes right away, leaving the curls soft.</li>

    <li> these are refills for us we love the product</li>
    <li> I love the Knot Today and the Curling custard. The curling custard defines my hair like no other and it&#x27;s not hard or crusty. The leave in is such a great conditioner- not too heavy. I rated this 3 stars instead of 5 because of the shampoo. I used it once and then I read the label and saw the sulfate. It also dried my hair out.</li>
    <li> my daughter has really curly hair and this has made her curls bouncy and glossy even in the 10 degree weather</li>
    <li> The Come Clean shampoo is average, in my opinion. The Knot Today is absolutely FANTASTIC for detangling and moisturizing. But the Curling Custard wins the prize. I used a moderate amount while in the shower after detangling with the Knot Today. I lightly rinsed out the Knot Today before applying the Curling Custard. I then allowed my hair to drip dry (not normal for me... I scrunch with a towel usually but since I had the CC in I skipped the use of towel) GORGEOUS curl definition, like I have NEVER experienced... My loose s-curl patterned hair that so easily frizzes was defined, tamed, and controlled. I had no white residue as others have reported. This product creates hold and when my hair dried, although it was controlled, it was soft to the touch. I am totally sold on the Curling Custard, 100%, and give it five stars. The detangler is also a five for me. The overall four star rating is due to the shampoo which is nothing special, in my humble opinion.</li>
    <li> These products are wonderful! It is hard to find products that won&#x27;t weigh your hair down and won&#x27;t leave your hair feeling crunchy. Kinkly curls is amazing! It not only keeps my hair soft, but my curls stay looking great all day. I have not used it during the summer, so it will be interesting to see how it holds up in southern humidity. I love the smell of these products, and the detangler conditioner does what it is suppose to....no more pulling my hair out! You can comb right through the mounds of curls without a single tangle!!! The custard gel is smooth, and it is nice to use only one styling product on my hair &amp; not a combine a bunch of other products to keep my hair together. My hair looks healthier and feels amazing!!! And being I have Celiac Disease it is hard to find styling products that are gluten free....these are worth buying &amp; stocking up your cabinet with. I&#x27;m always disappointed when a product gets discontinued, so I try to keep alot in stock!</li>
    <li> I use this on my 4b hair. My son uses it on his 3b hair. The texture is good. The smell is good. Moisturizing, and softening. I would recommend to use for hydration, and detangling.</li>
    <li> I have had the KCCC for a while now and it usually leaves my hair pretty crunchy but it held my curls so that didn&#x27;t bother me too much.  Now that I have used the entire line my hair is SOFT, SHINY, BOUNCY, AND GORGEOUS!  I&#x27;m guessing it had something to do with the Knot Today leave in with the KCCC.  This will now be my go to product for wash n gos!  I never realized how much oils held my hair down before using this product.  Check out my IG: Candibug84 for undeniable proof!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> Best product so far.  This combo cleans, softens and curls without leaving your hair hard and sticky..  Love It.</li>
    <li> This is a great set to have; it does what it promises to do.  The conditioner is awesome and it make the hair easy to comb through without pulling out the hair.  If you are a naturalist and where a lot of protective styles this product is prefect for.</li>
    <li> Works great on 4b curl pattern which is very course. The knot today really softens my hair and adds moisture</li>
    <li> I wanted to try it because a friend recommended it and it worked for me. I just have to comb through my hair really well.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my sister for Christmas. She loves it. She has natural hair and it makes her hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> The products themselves are fine but I didn&#x27;t realise that my hair would have to stay wet to keep the curls.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for washing hair and shampooing but I&#x27;d look elsewhere for keeping my hair curly. Especially since it&#x27;s winter .</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this for African American hair.  It strips out all oils and make the hair dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for what friend.  She was not able to replicate my hair style but uses it to curl her lightly textured hair. Fabulous job. Will recommend this as a good bargain buy.</li>
    <li> It really works!&lt;br /&gt;I used the conditioner as a leave in that I comb through, and then after a brief towel wrap to take away excess moisture, I run my hair through with the curling custard. depending on how wet my hair is, it can dry a little crunchy, but all you have to do is crunch your curls with your hands, and the hardness goes right away, leaving the curls soft.</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about this product and decided to buy this product. I really really LOVE this product. I used it on my sister hair as well and she Loves it too. My hair is so hard to comb out after I wash it with the Knot Clean Shampoo and Knot Today Leave in Detangler I can comb out my hair with no pulling or getting frustated. Once I put the Knot Today Leave In Detangler it&#x27;s like a miracle drug on my hair. I recommend this too anyone regardless of what type of hair you have. The Curling Custard stlying get works just as well too. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I have 3B curly hair in the front and two small chunks of 3C hair in the back that goes down to my waist. I&#x27;ve heard amazing things about the Kinky Curly line and I finally decided to give it a shot. However, these did not do much for my hair. The best part of this trio might be the shampoo because it s not super drying and smells nice, but I&#x27;d really bought this for the conditioner and custard. The conditioner provides nice slip and smells nice but I had to use almost half the bottle just to coat my hair and moisturize it. This isn&#x27;t entirely due to the length of my hair either as I&#x27;ve used much smaller amounts of better products and have gotten better results. Then I put in a small amount of the curling custard while my hair was still soaking wet with the conditoner in it. The custard has a strange texture. It looks almost liquidy in the pot but goes into your hair thick. The custard left an oil residue on my hair that made it look wet and greasy even when it was dry. I&#x27;m giving this two stars because while the conditoner is not something I&#x27;d buy again, it isn&#x27;t entirely awful. The other products though are practically useless to me. If you have long 3B curly hair and are looking to invest in a curl regimens that works, I do not recommend this. Instead I would suggest purchasing the Moraccan Oil Intensive Treatment and Garnier Curl Sculpting Cream Gel (both available through Amazon). Buying these two is about the same you&#x27;d spend on this but it&#x27;s given me much much much better results with far less product.</li>
    <li> All the products are good.  However I wish the price of the combo was a little bit cheaper.  I have already had to replace the custard twice.  But I still have the original conditioner and leave-in.</li>
    <li> Bad experience.  The shampoo and leave-in conditioner had my hair soft, but the curling custard left a white film on my hair and it was sticky.  It looked like I had dandruff in my hair or something.  Needless to say it was unsightly and I washed it out the same day.</li>
    <li> I was going from permed to natural hair (my hair&#x27;s only 5 - 6 inches long).  I wet rolled my hair in tight curls once a week (curls lasted the week), but as my natural hair began growing in, the rollers were not as effective.  I bought this to curl the natural hair while I continued to roll the permed hair.  It worked as I expected on coarse hair (mine), but not at all on soft, fine hair (my daughter&#x27;s).  I guess the nappier the better.  More is not better - Make sure you don&#x27;t put too much on (you won&#x27;t know until your hair has white scoobies in it).  I also don&#x27;t like the way my hands feel afterwards (very sticky).  Even once you wash your hands with soap and water, they still feel tacky.</li>
    <li> Makes hair nice and curly but leaves a white residue on hair.</li>
    <li> Shampoo - it cleans my hair differently than i&#x27;ve ever experienced. i&#x27;m really happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave in Conditioner - This product might not be enough for the amount of hair that I have, but it is helpful. I&#x27;ve started diluting it by adding it to a spray bottle with water. I use it more in my daughters&#x27; hair than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curling creme - This product was made to love my hair. I love my hair every time that I use it. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get it into the parts of my hair that need it, despite how thick and long my hair is. It distributes really well. It lasts all day. It has save me from relaxing my hair or cutting it off in frustration.</li>
    <li> I tried it once, not really for my hair. It left my hair a little dry but it did untangle it. The curling cream left my hair pretty stiff.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. It didn&#x27;t work on my hair as I expected it too. After it drys, it leaves a milky haze to my hair. I still however recommend this product if you want your curls to be more defined.</li>
    <li> I watched the video and followed all the instructions with marginal results.  I think this product would work better with wavy or slightly curly hair. My hair is extremely curly and it just didn&#x27;t stretch my curls like it said it would.  I gave it three stars, however, because the leave in conditioner and curling custard work really well for a twist out.  The curling custard does leave a flaky residue sometimes though.  I like that its all natural and I would probably order again for that reason.</li>
