      <li>It goes on smoothly and when it dries it actually makes my skin look better.</li>
      <li>Exactly the coverage and color</li>

<li> /&gt;Great for those with moderately dry skin - no streak marks!</li>
<li> it lasts a long time because it only comes out in small drops</li>
<li> Only complaint she has is that the shade is lighter than what she remembers.</li>
<li> I use much less product than if I was applying with my fingertips.</li>
<li> You would have to destroy the bottle to get it off.  </li>
<li> Not very effective for me.</li>
<li> Just teist slowly so you don&#x27;t waste product!</li>
<li> Bought for my wife who loves this stuff and is hard to find.</li>
<li> Sent the wrong shade, but I am learning to like it...</li>
<li> I hate to hear this formula has been discounted</li>

    <li> Great product as per my wife. She loves it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It goes on smoothly and when it dries it actually makes my skin look better. 2 clicks do the trick for me. After a while you might have to click more as it starts to get empty. Other than that I&#x27;m perfectly happy with this product. This is the best makeup I ever had. The only thing I would change is the brush. I would make it a little fuller and be able to to take it off so I can clean it better.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup ever.  I don&#x27;t want a lot of people to figure it out cuz I&#x27;m afraid the price will go up!!  That&#x27;s another thing I like about it, the price.  Ease of use and handy to travel.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time and will continue to use it.  Has excellent coverage and the color is perfect (for me).  love love love it</li>
    <li> When I found this product was going out of stock I ordered as many as I could find in my shade.  I use a light powder over it.</li>
    <li> I love this , it is so easy to apply and then I use a sponge to finish smoothing out .</li>
    <li> its pretty thick and feels caked on and very sticky feeling... i wouldnt buy this again.. try mac:) :) :)</li>
    <li> I have grown to love this foundation.  My first experience using a brush applicator took a little getting used to but once I mastered it I cannot imagine going back.  I love the coverage.  The foundation goes on smoothly, gives a medium coverage and leaves my complexion looking radiant.  Never over done, never streaky.  Moisturizing formula is kind to aging skin.  I hate to hear this formula has been discounted but I plan to use for as long as I can find it.</li>
    <li> This make up applies evenly and - assuming you pick the correct shade - disappears completely on your skin, leaving it close to flawless. It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly like the one I purchased at CVS, however they do not carry it anymore, AND the wonderful part is I paid a whole lot less !</li>
    <li> The order was perfect.</li>
    <li> The brush on my bottle clogged about half way through, so even though the product is excellent, I will not re-order it.  You also cannot just twist off the brush top.  You would have to destroy the bottle to get it off.  Not very effective for me.</li>

    <li> very good make up and I like the attached brush it lasts a long time because it only comes out in small drops</li>
    <li> I love this foundation. Covers great and does not feel heavy like a mask. I really love the brush on the end to apply the makeup. It never gets on my hands at all and blends the makeup perfectly.</li>
    <li> Exactly the coverage and color I was looking for. I think I may have found my new favorite. I am also a fan of the application brush on the bottle!</li>
    <li> Perfectly covers all spots, gives a smooth and healthy look to your skin. Has a moisturising feature and I would say for this price you could not even dream of getting a better foundation! Excellent value!</li>
    <li> L&#x27;OREAL PARIS MAKEUP SMOOTHING BEIGE IS WONDERFUL. i&#x27;M 66 AND HAD TI WORK WITH THE BRUSH FOR A SHORT TIME. L0VE IT.</li>
    <li> I Like the easy application. n natural color to my skin. doesn&#x27;t need to be applied often.&lt;br /&gt;thanks.....</li>
    <li> Sent the wrong shade, but I am learning to like it...</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife who loves this stuff and is hard to find. Only complaint she has is that the shade is lighter than what she remembers. She will go a shade or two darker next time.</li>
    <li> Great quality but twist cap goes out quickly  However product still works. Just teist slowly so you don&#x27;t waste product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MAKEUP!!!</li>
