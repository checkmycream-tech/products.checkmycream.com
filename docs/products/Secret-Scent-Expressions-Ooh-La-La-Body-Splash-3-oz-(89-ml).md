<li> This is a calming,yet inviting,  scent,  its very hard to find in stores , finally i found it on Amazon! !</li>
<li> I use Secret deodorant anyway so that may make my review a bit partial.</li>
<li> I usually buy body sprays from Bath and Body Works.</li>
<li> The picture shows two bottles of the product, and nowhere in the listing does it say that the order is just for one bottle of the Secret Scent Expression body splash.</li>
<li> It is Lavender but Secret manages to make a Lavender smelling product that is not overbearing at all.</li>
<li> Needless to say all is well again with me.  </li>
<li> I was afraid that this spray would have an alcohol-smell to it as some sprays tend to do, but this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> my disappointed purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> DISAPPOINTED!!!!</li>

    <li> Great smell. Not overpowring.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item quickly because it was exactly what I was looking for. The picture is misleading and I spent over 7 dollars for a 3 oz item, when you can by them at Walmart for $3. A little disappointed with that, but the fragrance smells amazing and it is a cheap perfume.</li>
    <li> My favorite body spray.</li>
    <li> The scent is very light and feminine. The spray is not overpowering. Very nice. Mrs. Martha Wilson-Harris</li>
    <li> Love the scent does not last long tho</li>
    <li> I had the impression I was getting 2 bottles of the body spray but only 1 came in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;Had I known this, I would not have spent the money on one bottle!&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!! The smell is great &amp; I have been looking for this, but the picture should be changed and the description should specify!&lt;br /&gt;YOU ONLY GET ONE BOTTLE!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product through Procter Gamble Oral/FC. The picture shows two bottles of the product, and nowhere in the listing does it say that the order is just for one bottle of the Secret Scent Expression body splash. Also, the price is relatively equal to two bottles bought at the store. I only received one bottle of the body splash. Why would you put a picture of two bottles if there is only one available for purchase?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the purchase, I tried to contact the seller, and while they responded quickly, have not offered much help or explanation as to how to return the product or make amends to the misleading picture and my disappointed purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now on, I will be buying my spray from Target where it is a more reasonable price for a package of two.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it because it looked like someone else had already been using it. The bottle was nasty to touch and there wasn&#x27;t a top only scotch tap over the pump.</li>
    <li> This scent is amazing! I normally do not like lavender fragrances,but this one got me.  I am not perfume girl. I usually buy body sprays from Bath and Body Works. Now, I will be buying this. Hope Secret has some other wonderful body sprays I can purchase.</li>
    <li> should have paid attention to the reviews- note -you only get 1- VERY misleading. not much lavender smell- seems to smell more like apples.</li>
    <li> This is a calming,yet inviting,  scent,  its very hard to find in stores , finally i found it on Amazon! ! Needless to say all is well again with me.  Buy it buy it ,several at the. Time if i could!</li>
    <li> I like it.but the price little pit high.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body spray so far, made by Secret. It is Lavender but Secret manages to make a Lavender smelling product that is not overbearing at all. The smell is gentle and has a pleasant &amp; relaxing smell to it. I used to be able to find this product in my local stores but they no longer carry it. I have tried other lavender sprays, since lavender is my favorite scent, but this one is by far my favorite. I use Secret deodorant anyway so that may make my review a bit partial. But I do enjoy the secret brand because it is gentle on your skin (I tend to have sensitive skin) and because the smell of their products is generally not overwhelming. My sense of smell is a little on the sensitive side too. I can&#x27;t stand the majority of the perfumes out there. So if I like this one, they must be doing something right! I highly recommend it, especially if you are looking for a lighter scent.</li>
    <li> This smells so good! I used to find it at Wal-Mart but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s been discontinued. I am very sensitive to certain fragrances but have no issues with this one.</li>
    <li> You are put it in the picture two but I take only one why you are not wrate this itme only one</li>
    <li> Ooohhhh La La Lavender  body spray is really a great sent.  Nice and delicate smell and not over powering in the least. A must have for your daily routine.</li>
    <li> Originally given to me as a gift.  I just love the the soft gentle smell.  Not over powering.</li>
    <li> I like the way it works for me</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as I was expecting and it smells amazing!  I was afraid that this spray would have an alcohol-smell to it as some sprays tend to do, but this one doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m a big lavender fan and I was very pleased with this product.</li>
