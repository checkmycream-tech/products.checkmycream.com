      <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try!</li>
      <li>and it doesnt look greasy or frizzy at all, if anything it gets better as time goes by!</li>
      <li>but I immediately washed my hair with my trusted Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine shampoo and conditioner and my hair is so much better!</li>
      <li>I have tried many shampoos and none have ever came close to this one!</li>
      <li>LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>I have been telling people to try it for months now and the ones who have love it!  </li>
      <li>It smells and feels amazing</li>
      <li>is amazing.</li>
      <li>It smells great and made my curly hair so sleek and smooth.</li>
      <li>I REALLY LIKED IT</li>
      <li>Now that it&#x27;s just been dyed, it&#x27;s kind of damaged.</li>
      <li>i had to use some leave in conditioner but honestly didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
      <li>, it smelled nice until I poured it in my hand and went to wash my hair with it.</li>
      <li>It smelled nice in the store, it smelled nice in the car when my friend asked to smell it</li>
      <li>These sell for a great price and They shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>Also, the scent is light and pleasant.</li>
      <li>smell is good, not too strong.  </li>
      <li>I have not used the kit yet but so far very impressed.</li>
      <li>So I thought too good to be true</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re a satisfied</li>
      <li>This helps your hair get so much more moisture from the conditioner, and still allows the shampoo to remove a bit of the dulling parts of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Words cannot express how much I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this product and the conditioner as well.</li>
      <li>Top of my scalp feels like a buzz cut.  </li>
      <li>I had to cut about 4 inches of my hair to get rid of most of the damage.</li>
      <li>There is a Facebook Group with many girls who have ruined their hair with this product as well.</li>
      <li>Then I took one sniff of the product and fell in love with both the scent and the idea of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have Lost most of my hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this item because I thought that it would simply reduce frizz and make my hair sleek and manageable, and it worked perfectly for that.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 100% sure after reading all of these reviews</li>
      <li>But, I never wanted to do an all-out keratin treatment because I LOVE my curls.  </li>
      <li>After using this once, I was  pleased with the outcome.</li>
      <li>I am removing it from my list of favorite shampoos.</li>
      <li>So when I found the Suave Keratiin I thought, ok, so they&#x27;ve improved.</li>
      <li>Its been about 6 months, and I&#x27;m finally able to wear my hair curly again, but its still not quite where I want it to</li>
      <li>and I waited more than the time instructed after coloring.  </li>
      <li>I give it two stars just because I love the scent, and the way it made my hair smell.</li>
      <li>Over the years my hair has gotten drier and frizzier (even though salons say my hair is actually perfectly healthy).</li>
      <li>Great product for curly hair to go straight.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You NEED to get the leave in conditioner with this product because that just adds to the smoothness and is way better than hairspray</li>
      <li>but it looks so much better.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo</li>
      <li>Nothing healthy about it.</li>
      <li>I decided to take a budget break from my favorite Kiehl&#x27;s products that are around $20/bottle for this at around $3/bottle at Kroger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I was perfectly healthy</li>
      <li>and when I wake up the next morning, it STILL looks great!</li>
      <li>better not buy it.</li>
      <li>I have been using joico shampoo and conditioner that cost about 20 bucks and  this suave products works even better.</li>
      <li>When I saw the advertisements I thought that, as it claims, it would do as well as more expansive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>I will say that it does a great job of making my hair straight with no frizz</li>
      <li>Now I just use this shampoo and conditioner and then a bit of smoothing leave-in conditioner, and her hair is considerably more manageable (no hair spray needed).</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo and have NO IDEA how I will survive if they discontinue it.  </li>
      <li>I have unruly/frizzy/wavy hair, and this product is able to keep it under control.  </li>
      <li>I have tried argan oil, I have tried too many products to mention.</li>
      <li>I came onto Amazon to buy more of this, and then I read the 1 star reviews.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>There are many chemicals in this product and my scalp is burning after just using it twice.</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>and I kept pulling my hair to the side and touching</li>
      <li>I love my hair although it does get frizzy in humidity.</li>
      <li>Better to have frizzy hair than no hair at all.  </li>
      <li>For the first couple of months I loved it.</li>
      <li>I really loved this product at first because it changed my hair.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it I loved it.</li>
      <li>and I loved it at first.</li>
      <li>It worked good at first</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve tried &amp; I think I&#x27;ve tried everything, high to low end. I use the professional smoothing products, not the professional color care ones. I get way less breakage, yay! &amp; my hair feels &amp; looks like it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s nice hair, not my usual out of control mess! Who&#x27;d have thought Suave? Wish I&#x27;d have discovered this before I spent so much on all the high end products with promises but no real results!</li>
    <li> I looked up the reviews just to see if I was the only one experiencing the same results overtime. It worked good at first but as time goes on this stuff destroys your hair. I WOULDNT SUGGEST BUYING IT!</li>
    <li> I started using this product while I was in college because I liked how smooth it left my hair and it was affordable for a broke college student. I noticed not long after using it my hair was slightly thinning, when I asked my doctor about it I was told it&#x27;s just stress and recommended to take a multi vitamin daily. When I asked my hair stylist she suggested I was using a flat iron too often and to cut back in addition to my doctors suggestion. Fast forward 4-5 years of using only this product on my hair and my scalp is almost entirely visible. I broke down and went to a new doctor thinking maybe my thinning hair was related to possible thyroid problems or another illnesses that run in my family. After getting the blood work back we knew everything fine and I was perfectly healthy but my hair was continuing to fall out. So it was then when I started my new regimen of no heat styling, only using all natural shampoo and conditioner, and taking daily multivitamins for hair growth. I finally broke down and went to see a dermatologist about my hair thinning issue and she put me on a prescription twice a day that requires monthly blood work. I ended up cutting 8 inches off my hair and continuing my regimen with only occasional heat styling while following my dermatologists orders. After 7 months I can report that my hair has greatly approved but still has far to go in order to return to what was normal before.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo a few weeks ago, after using it I noticed my scalp was severely itchy and red.  I didn&#x27;t know what was wrong!  Then my eyes started to tear up all day and then developed red itchy eyelids.  My eyes were swollen, red and flaky.  I finally thought that maybe it might be the shampoo and conditioner.  I bought a cleansing shampoo and within a day my red scalp was normal again and my red itchy swollen eyes went back to normal again.  I would never use this again! There is something in it that causes a bad allergic reaction, at least in me.</li>
    <li> i got this shampoo because  i had gotten the keratin treatment MONTHS ago and it hard worn out (I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR USING WITH A RECENT TREATMENTS! -it has LOW sulfates that can undo the process).&lt;br /&gt;my hair has been so dry lately that i need a little boost. with just the first wash in the shower i cud feel my hair more smooth, then the conditioner really made it smoother and by the time i got out of the shower i cudnt stop touching my hair :)</li>
    <li> My hair is long, naturally curly, and can be difficult to manage at times. I wear it curly 24/7 and just towel-dry it, style it and go. With that being said, I was hoping this shampoo &amp; conditioner would make my curls look smooth and frizz-free when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first day I used these products, I could tell a slight difference in the way my hair felt even while it was wet. However, the ultimate test was when it dried, and sure enough, my hair felt soft and smooth after it dried. I was pretty optimistic at this point. But these products claim to keep your hair frizz-free for 48 hours...um, no. It didn&#x27;t even keep my hair frizz-free on the first day, let alone the second!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing it did was change the way my hair felt. But hey, for $2.74 a bottle at Wal-Mart, you get what you pay for I guess. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type, maybe my expectations were too high, whatever it is I will probably not be buying this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been using joico shampoo and conditioner that cost about 20 bucks and  this suave products works even better. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just for my hair, but I am so happy to have found a product for 7 bucks that  I am content with. I used alba but it didn&#x27;t suite my hair as well as this one.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing the suave keratin shampoo and conditioner, I was very skeptical that it could do what was really promised. I used it for the first time yesterday and it made my hair very soft and it dried perfectly straight. I naturally have straight hair but after bleaching it blonde and then dying it dark, it has been very frizzy and never dries straight. It has been over 24 hours since I have washed my hair and it doesnt look greasy or frizzy at all, if anything it gets better as time goes by! I bought the shampoo and conditioner at walmart for 2.75/ea and it was well worth it! It is cheaper than normal shampoo and works better! I will probably never use anything else again! VERY PLEASED.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy Suave at all. It feels cheap and I feel like it always leaves my hair in worse condition. But when I saw that they had a new keratin line, I was willing to give it a shot because I had be looking into experimenting with keratin products and this was just the right price to try it. Less than $4 bucks? Can&#x27;t pass it up. I only bought the shampoo, cause I still had a full bottle of pantene conditioner. Either way, after the first wash even my boyfriend noticed a difference! And he never really notices stuff about my hair. It felt so much smoother and softer and just more manageable! My hair is very damaged since I am constantly changing hair colors and straightening and curling it, and it has a course texture because of this. Next time I go shopping I will be buying the conditioner to see if it makes a difference, but I think I have definitely found my permanent shampoo:D Suave has officially converted me.</li>
    <li> I saw commercials for this product and generally shampoos like Suave tend to dry out my naturally very curly hair. I&#x27;ve had friends who have gotten Keratin treatments but I fear how it will look when it grows out, the steep price and I don&#x27;t want ALL of the curl to disappear as theirs have. I decided to take a budget break from my favorite Kiehl&#x27;s products that are around $20/bottle for this at around $3/bottle at Kroger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more than happy with the results! My curls are super bouncy, smooth and little frizz, even in the muggy Ohio summer weather. The smell is nice and my curls stay nice for a few days. I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the perfect companion (along with the conditioner as well) to the Suave  Keratin infusion 30 Day smoothing system. It helps keep hair smoother, softer, with less harsh chemicals. I would note that it contains LESS sulfates, and is not sulfate free,(my reason for 4 stars and not 5) but I still find it leaves my hair soft, shiny and smoother than regular anti-frizz shampoos. If you have had a Keratin smoothing treatment done or just want to tame your dry, frizzy hair, this is a great shampoo and is much less expensive than other brands.</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed anything on Amazon before, but after researching \\&quot;hair falling out\\&quot; and reading the post by someone else who had the same issue, I felt I NEEDED to review this product. I have been using this product for over a year now and I loved it at first. It does make the hair smoother and softer. Then I started noticing my hair was thinning. Then it started to come out in handfuls in the shower. Then I noticed the rug where I blow dry was becoming covered in hair, not to mention the rug outside the shower where I towel dry my hair. And I started to feel my hair breaking when I comb it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was age (I&#x27;m 50), too much estrogen in my system or even the anxiety medicine I take (which could also be contributing). But after reading other reviews that sounded EXACTLY like my situation, I am convinced the SHAMPOO is the culprit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had always thought of Suave products as being \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; and my hair salon steered me away from them. I&#x27;ve tried Redken (which I didn&#x27;t like) and other expensive shampoos, but they were just pricey and didn&#x27;t do what they said they claimed. So when I found the Suave Keratiin I thought, ok, so they&#x27;ve improved. This stuff does what it says. NOT SO MUCH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased two bottles of this shampoo and they are going right back to the store, along with an empty bottle that&#x27;s still in my recycling bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOODBYE Suave Keratin! And good riddance! If my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back in I&#x27;ll be joining the law suit.</li>
    <li> My hair is very damaged due to blow drying and straightening. I grew my hair long, just above my butt, but it had become unmanageable. The frizz was out of control, my hair was splitting and breaking, and I couldn&#x27;t get a brush through it. My hair would turn into a wavy frizzball within 2 hours after styling. I ended up cutting off about 8 inches of my hair in an effort to make it healthier. Imagine how upset I was when I realized that the haircut made NO difference... it was still nearly impossible to get a brush through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what low sulfates or keratin means, so none of that affected my decision to buy the shampoo. Lots of shampoos *say* they reduce frizz, keep hair tamed in humidity, and blah blah blah, but they never work... so I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product either. I honestly only bought it because I was running low on cash, and Suave is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprised at how much better my hair was after using this shampoo. My hair is soft, and it takes a lot less time to style. The best part is that I style my hair at 5:30am and it&#x27;s still looking fabulous when it&#x27;s time to go to bed... and when I wake up the next morning, it STILL looks great! I can run my fingers through my hair again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have this wave that would show up above my ear... no matter how much product I put in it, and how much I straightened it, I&#x27;d have that stupid wave on my head a few hours after straightening. Not anymore though; I haven&#x27;t seen it since I started using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It&#x27;s seriously a miracle product. I just wish I would have discovered it BEFORE I chopped all my hair off.</li>
    <li> When I saw the advertisements I thought that, as it claims, it would do as well as more expansive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe it, this product is a terrible one. It made my hair clumpy,strange, very frizzy and dull. I thought it would at least smooth my hair - nope, it made my hair worse. It smelled like dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe that I wasted the money on this, and moreover that I fell for the advertisements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please take my advice.</li>
    <li> m yhair is short and extremely thick.I used it and i was really surprised for an hour. The next thing i knew my hair was dry and back to extremely thick .  My hair is either to thick or the shampoo doesnt work well</li>
    <li> I just tried Suave Professional Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo (and the  Conditioner too) for the first time, and it is amazing. My hair feels softer and looks smoother. My hair is much less frizzy and much more manageable. I couldn&#x27;t believe that my hair would look different after one washing, but it did. Thank you Suave for offering an outstanding product at a more than reasonable price. I can only hope that the product stands up over time. I am looking forward to finding out.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo and the conditioner for the first time today. While it didn&#x27;t leave my hair in the pin straight condition I hoped for (and let it be known that nowhere does this product promise pin straight hair), I am very pleased with the softness, shine and body. I can definitely see that I have less frizz and I&#x27;m guessing a minute or so with a flat iron will give me my desired results. Good value for the results. I&#x27;m not wild about the scent but I can get used to it.</li>
    <li> She bought several in the line of products and her hair dissolved..her hair was to the middle of her back and she had to have 10 inches cut off...turned her hair into a gelatinous mess...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review on here before, but I did read a couple of the reviews on here before I went out and bought this product. I&#x27;m completely hooked!!!! I had been using Tresemme&#x27;s dry shampoo product for the past couple years, but not really using it because I wasn&#x27;t sure it really made a difference in my hair appearance. Now I know better!! This Suave product is less expensive than the Tresemme, and makes my hair look like it was done in a salon!!! I&#x27;m not kidding! It was extra shiny, smooth, NOT greasy looking, and it did add volume to the bottom of my hair. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It&#x27;s going to save my hair from dying. Go out and buy it NOW!!!</li>
    <li> Horrible stuff! My hairdresser recommend a keratin shampoo/ conditioner to help straighten my naturally curly hair. Used this for two weeks and had to stop. Not only did my color fade, but my scalp is swollen and feels bruised. Terrible headaches as well. Have stopped using about a week now and pain is still there but slowly fading.</li>
    <li> My hair is less frizzy and much smoother. The smell is ok, not the best, but not terrible like some reviews have said. I am giving this 4 stars simply because I was under the impression that it would do more to break my curl as I air dried.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product only because it was cheap and needed shampoo before i moved out of my apartment. Lo and behold, after just one use (along with the conditioner) my hair was tamed. My hair is already smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight thick hair, and I take a shower at night. When woke up, I just brushed it a little and it was ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would definitely recommend it for people with similar hair types.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works on everyone&#x27;s hair so I&#x27;ll speak for myself - this shampoo (and the conditioner) is amazing. I have curly/wavy/poofy/frizzy loooong hair and let me tell you, this product really tames my mane. It feels very soft and it&#x27;s super manageable, and it kinds of loosens some of the weird curls a bit (which could be a good or bad thing depending on what you want). It smells great, and now I&#x27;m going to buy the leave-in serum(?).</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo. But the reason I&#x27;m giving it five whole stars is the unexpected effect of freshly clean-looking hair for longer than I&#x27;ve ever had. I have the sort of hair that can get a little greasy looking by the end of the night, and by the next morning it&#x27;s always pretty gross and unmanageable before showering. However, since I started using this shampoo, I&#x27;ve noticed that the next morning it always looks perfectly clean, dry...even nicely styled. I&#x27;m excited about this aspect for whenever I may be in a rush and not have time to shower.</li>
    <li> Is there a No Star rating? Do not Buy this product. Over a six-month. I have Lost most of my hair. I never knew why my hair was falling out so bad after using the shampoo and conditioner because my hair texture was smoothing out. But after watching my hair length shortened, I decided to Google hair loss using keratin conditioner by suave, I discovered there was a class action suit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 3-4 weeks ago.  I have thick, very wavy, curly hair and I am always looking for a good smoothing shampoo.  This product seemed to work great at first, then like several other reveiws I started to notice an large amount of hair loss, it was quite alarming.  Then my scalp started to itch and get red and seem to have some kind of build up on it.  I stopped using it for a few times and it cleared up.  Thinking it was another product causing the irritation I used it again, BIG Mistake!!  I went to my haridresser today and she asked me if I had phsorisis, no never.  She said my scalp was red allover and looked like it was \\&quot;peeling\\&quot;.  She said it almost looked like a chemical burn.  I can only attibute it to this shampoo since it started after the first use, cleared up when I didn&#x27;t use it, then flared up again 2 days ago when I used it again.  I don&#x27;t know if it is a severe allergic reaction to the product, but I can truly say it was terrible for me and is going in the trash.  My hairdresser advised me to consult my doctor to see if I could get some medicated shampoo for a bit to try to heal my scalp.</li>
    <li> I had dry ends and decided to buy this product to smooth the ends and well everything since the picture on the box makes you want to have that exact silky hair. I wish i could rewind time and never had applied this stupid product to my hair.First of all, It smells like death! Second, as soon as i started drying it w/ the blow dryer i noticed it was frizzy and even my mom pointed that out as soon as she saw me. It was so disappointing.  As the days went by my hair just looked fried from certain areas and everyone noticed. I had to cut about 4 inches of my hair to get rid of most of the damage. Even now with almost \\&quot;short\\&quot; hair when i blow dry it it&#x27;s frizzy. My hair has never been frizzy. It looks like the before picture on the box. Please do your research before buying any smoothing product for your hair. I regret buying this product. It makes me want to cry when i think of how my hair use to be. There is a Facebook Group with many girls who have ruined their hair with this product as well. Apparently, they are facing a lawsuit for \\&quot;false advertising\\&quot;. I can&#x27;t believe this product is even out there.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a low sulfate shampoo and I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed. I usually use Suave Professionals Shea and Cocoa Butter shampoo and conditioner and never thought a Suave product could get my hair looking or feeling better. I could have been more wrong. For a low sulfate shampoo, this has a really thick and soft lather and a really nice smell. After rinsing, my hair felt soft when it normally feels rough, dry and a bit sticky. In combination with the conditioner, I can most definitely feel a huge difference. My hair is super soft and REALLY light, which is totally different than my usually heavy thick hair. The frizz and fly-aways seem to be the same, but I&#x27;m using another brand anti-frizz serum. I have plans to purchase the Suave Keratin Serum and see if that&#x27;s not a better suit for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line... LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with the Conditioner last week. Since all these new Keratin products seem to be the rage for curly frizzy hair I thought I&#x27;d jump on the bandwagon and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say.. I didn&#x27;t see any change in my hair..and I still have to use my Marakesh X products to help smooth it out. Also the scent is so overpowering I cant stand it..  I wont be using the rest of the product unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually think Suave Almond &amp; Shea Butter Shampoo &amp; Conditioner works and smells 100x better!</li>
    <li> I bought the Suave Keratin Infusion Smoothing Treatment Kit on April 3, 2012, after seeing the commercials on TV and cutting out a coupon.  I wanted my long hair to be smooth and silky like the model. I should have read reviews before using it.  I followed all the instructions.  I do color my hair every six weeks and I waited more than the time instructed after coloring.  I should have been warned by the strong perm-type smell of the product. I kept thinking how it was a keratin product that should be great for my hair. I put the first part of the treatment on my hair and started combing it as instructed to do during the treatment to keep the hair smooth.  As I started combing my hair the comb filled up with my broken hair.  I could hear my hair snapping off as I combed it. I was shocked and immediately washed the product out of my hair.  I put the enclosed conditioner on to try to help the damage. It did not help.  My hair was fried and strawlike with some places feeling sticky.  I grabbed the box and took off to the nearest hair salon for help.  The stylist verified that my hair was fried and melted and there was no choice but to cut my hair into a short bob.  She also put on a deep conditioning treatment that I left on until the next morning. I have been back once already after 5 weeks to trim off more dead ends.  I have to use a deep conditioning treatment regularly and a heat protector on my hair so that I can blow dry it for work.  The only plus side is that everyone liked my short hairstyle! I am thankful I did not go bald or have burning scalp like some people.  Make sure you always review new products before using.  I sure learned a hard lesson.</li>
    <li> First off let me say this product is perfect, seriously! I have been looking for something reasonable priced that will allow me to wear my hair down without the frizz and this does it. To give you an idea my hair is very curly (not exactly like Shirley Temple, but close that it&#x27;s hard to get the curls out), it&#x27;s thick and frizzy and this product eliminates that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You NEED to get the leave in conditioner with this product because that just adds to the smoothness and is way better than hairspray and like I said these products are not expensive (especially at Walmart) it&#x27;s like less than $10 for shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a survivor of the bad hair life war I can finally say it is over and I have found a product that has allowed me to wear my hair down whenever I have had the urge to. THANK YOU!!!!</li>
    <li> Just so terrible! After about a month of use I noticed LARGE (and I mean huge!) amounts of hair loss! I have, now had, thick wavy hair and have loss over 1/4th of my head! I am almost in tears when I have to brush or put my hair up from all the hair coming out! At first I was attributing it several other factors, until my head started to burn and itch. Stopped using it and cleared up right away. Just threw the shampoo, conditioner, heating cream all in the trash. I wish I could give this negative stars! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!!! You will regret it as soon as you do :( hoping to restore my hair with vitamins and REAL shampoo 😭</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I really, really wanted to like this product, but at the same time I was skeptical that Suave&#x27;s Professional Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo could prevent frizz as well as Kerastase&#x27;s Bain-Oleo Relax Shampoo (which I have used with great success for around 3 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the product actually does a decent job of controlling frizz throughout the day, even on humid days.  I think it actually lives up to its claim that the frizz control is comparable to what you find with Kerastase.  Also, this is a GREAT buy - Considerably less than the $36 I shell out every couple of months for the Kerastase shampoo.  However (and this is a big however), it accomplishes the frizz prevention by weighing hair down with what feels like a waxy, slightly oily coating.  Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as if it&#x27;s been well cleaned (even after 2 washings) - This may be the result of the lower sulfates used.  This is just a guess, as I&#x27;ve never used a lower-sulfate shampoo before this one.  What I love about Kerastase&#x27;s product is that it achieves great frizz prevention, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down in the least, and rinses completely out.  After washing with Kerastase, my hair feels conditioned, weightless and, most importantly, totally clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally speaking, this is a decent frizz-control shampoo, especially for the great price.  But if you&#x27;re a satisfied Kerastase Bain-Oleo Relax user like me, I would venture to say you&#x27;ll be disappointed in the results of this product as they compare to what you are used to with Kerastase.</li>
    <li> This product is seriously terrible.  I has made my hair heavy and kind of stiff, and just made it smell bad.  Anyone that says this works like a keratin treatment I can guarantee has never set foot in a real salon. At least it was only $3, or else I&#x27;d be livid. Back to my Redken and Brocato I go.</li>
    <li> I wish I had listened to the reviews about the smell. I bought the shampoo and conditioner. It is like a cheap strong man&#x27;s cologne.  Awful.  I rinsed much longer than usual to try and make sure the smell was not going to be a problem.  Still stinky.  And you don&#x27;t get used to it like when you are wearing perfume.  I smell it still after hours.  The results on my hair are just ok nothing special or better than any other shampoo I have ever used.  Don&#x27;t buy this unless you have no sense of smell!</li>
    <li> My Hair Was Once thick, And Beautiful. Now It Is A Frizzy, Thin, Disaster!!!!!!!  My Once Beautiful Long Hair Was Healthy And Full Of Body, But Now Is Stringy, Thin And Full Of Breaks And Split Ends!!!!  Even After Trimming, It Just Keeps Breaking!  My Hair Would Fall Out In Clumps!!!!!!  My Pony Tail Is So Thin Now, It Makes Me Want To Cry. I Am Devistated! I&#x27;m So Upset.  I Was Saving My Hair Clumps To Take To The Doctor Thinking Something Was Wrong With Me.  Its The Product!!!!!!!  DON&#x27;T USE IT, EVER!  I WISH I COULD HAVE MY HAIR BACK!  I DON&#x27;T EVEN WANT TO LEAVE MY HOUSE!  :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has very curly hair. Before I was using quite a bit of mousse and/or hair spray to keep her hair under control, and even still it would be all over by the end of the day. That was really drying her hair out, so i decided to give this a try. I think it works quite well for the price. Now I just use this shampoo and conditioner and then a bit of smoothing leave-in conditioner, and her hair is considerably more manageable (no hair spray needed). I&#x27;ve even started using it on my younger daughter who had bi-racial hair and the results are the same. I would recommend giving it a try at least if you have curly or frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I was dissapointed with the fragrance in this conditioner. Its too strong, smells bad, and&lt;br /&gt;Flares up my asthma! Will never use again.</li>
    <li> Shampoo and conditioner left hair with a residue that made my hair look like I used too much hairspray.  I had to use a cleanser shampoo to remove.  This occurred after only 3 washes and it smells like an old woman&#x27;s perfume.  Really disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed a product online so this review means I have found something worth shouting from the roof tops! I picked up suave keratin infusion shampoo and conditioner on a whim, I grabbed it because it said keratin and I have severely damaged hair from bleaching it. My hair is strawlike and was breaking off at the crown. I have tried, its a 10. I have tried argan oil, I have tried too many products to mention. After washing my hair and drying it I was stunned. My once sad and awful hair now looks silky, shiny, and golden! It smells and feels amazing and my husband instantly noticed a change in my hair as well. I will be buying this product again, I still can not believe that a drugstore shampoo and conditioner have healed my hair! This stuff is worth a try and with its reasonable prices, what do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> I have been having professional keratin treatments for a couple years now. I decided to try this product out along with the conditioner. NOT GOOD!!! Within a few minutes after using this product my hair began to break off and fall out in clumps. I called my stylist right away and found out that the chemicals in these over the counter keratin products are not compatible with professional products. They are made with a much lower grade of ingredients and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;  I now have a very short haircut that will take me about 2 years to grow back to the length I had. STAY AWAY FROM THESE PRODUCTS!!!! Too late for me but not for you.</li>
    <li> used this product  a couple of times..i love the fragrance (light floral)..and it made my hair soft..great price as well!</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, I am relieved that I found these reviews, but sadden for all the people who have dealt with the hair loss as well. I have dyed my hair for a while and I bleached it a couple of times. Now that it&#x27;s just been dyed, it&#x27;s kind of damaged. My ends were pretty bad, so I got them cut off. I used Tresemme shampoo for a while, then my mom brought this stuff home. I started using it right away and holy crap, I regret it. My hair is falling out in CLUMPS in the shower!! I thought it was just from damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;Until today when I quickly washed my hair and saw the clumps of hair sticking to the tub. I picked up the bottle, pulled out my phone, Googled this product and saw all the reviews of other people having the same problem!! My mom still thinks it&#x27;s damaged hair, but I swear it&#x27;s not. It can&#x27;t be. My hair didn&#x27;t start doing this till after I used this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, the back of my head is always itchy and I started to get dandruff. Also, it always feels so...dry and just..tangled, almost. I went to a concert outdoors and I kept pulling my hair to the side and touching it felt so bad. NEVER will I buy Suave.</li>
    <li> I am the type of person that changes my shampoo every time I run out.  I love the way this product makes my hair feel but every couple of months I have been in the doctors office for a vaginal yeast infection I have spent a long time trying to find the cause of it and the only time I get them is when I use this product.  For the last year and a half every 3 to 4 months I have purchased this product and did not even think it could be the cause of my suffering.  I would not recommend this shampoo or conditioner to any one.  I am removing it from my list of favorite shampoos.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this has so many bad reviews. My hair must be opposite of the rest of the worlds. I never had any luck with the Suave Professional line. I always ended up using them for body wash since my hair disliked them, till now! I finally hit on a good one !  Hair is not weighed down at all! It looks healthy, really does feel smooth and is quite manageable. This stuff goes a long way too as I only need a small amount to do the job. A great find !  :)  PS: I have only used it a few times, so if my hair get dry or falls out like others describe I will update.</li>
    <li> For months, my hair has been falling out at an exorbitant rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was really bad - I&#x27;d pick up strands just by touching my head. At first, I thought it was my diet and stress but I realized it started when I started to use Suave. I&#x27;ve stopped using the shampoo and conditioner, and I am not losing as much as hair. The difference is very apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not worth the hair loss.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I thought that it would simply reduce frizz and make my hair sleek and manageable, and it worked perfectly for that.  But, I never wanted to do an all-out keratin treatment because I LOVE my curls.  I have the type of hair where people I don&#x27;t know stop me on the street to compliment my curls, but within a month of using this product, my curls started to disappear :(.  At first,  I thought maybe I was blow-drying it and flat ironing it too often (which I wasn&#x27;t really doing any more than I did before using this product), but I eventually realized that it was the shampoo and conditioner that was eliminating my curls.  I stopped using it, and sure enough, my roots started to grow out curly again.  I was in a weird transitional period for a while where the top of my hair was curly and the bottom half of my hair was straight from using this product.  Its been about 6 months, and I&#x27;m finally able to wear my hair curly again, but its still not quite where I want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hair is naturally straight, or your hair is curly/wavy and you want it to be straight, this is a great product.  It really did make my hair soft and manageable.  I usually spend a lot of money on shampoo and conditioner, I was shocked at myself for loving such an affordable product.  In fact, my sisters dropped their expensive hair products to use this after they tried it.  But, after seeing how it took away my curls, I&#x27;m back to using my $40 shampoo, and to me that feels like money well spent.</li>
    <li> I have to say ever since i bought this shampoo ive notice hair lost i thought it was me but after my neighbor told me that she was using it n stop cuz she notice alot of hair lost n i was like im using the same one that explains why my hair was falling off !! N i thought it was me !! I thru my blottles</li>
    <li> First let me say, I have naturally curly hair. VERY CURLY. I love my hair although it does get frizzy in humidity. I got this product because Keratin is supposedly good for your hair...this product is a terrible product for curly hair. I used both the shampoo and conditioner and dried my hair like usual and I noticed my hair flat. At first I thought it just took the frizz away but after my hair was totally dry a couple hours later, I could tell it straighten my hair! I was extremely ticked off. The next day (today) my hair was in knots everywhere! I don&#x27;t understand how I got a bunch of tangles but I immediately washed my hair with my trusted Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine shampoo and conditioner and my hair is so much better! This is the worst product I have ever used and I would NEVER buy this product again or recommend it to anyone other than people with straight hair or people who want straight hair.</li>
    <li> DONT BUY! i have been using this product the past 2 months and I wish i would have seen this reviews before i bought it.. switched my shampoos and conditioner that I always use and never had hair loss like this yea a few strands here and there but the past weeks my hair has been falling out in clumps my brush after one use is full of hair! now my hair is so thin its ugly I hope it grows back</li>
    <li> Used this product for 3 weeks. I thought my birth control was making my hair fall out. NO it was the shampoo! My scalp became sore red and itchy. My hair is falling out like crazy. My body even broke out in hives.</li>
    <li> I have spent lots of money on other shampoos / conditioners and I must admit that I have been pleasantly surprised with Suave Professionals Keratin.  I have thin natural blonde hair without any color treatment, yet my hair tends to get dry easily.  The Suave Keratin combo keep my hair smooth and shiny all day. Even when I wake up I find that my hair has not dried out. Also, the scent is light and pleasant. I highly recommend this shampoo for anyone looking to make a difference without spending a fortune.</li>
    <li> I bought a big bottle of Suave and got a sample of this shampoo .&lt;br /&gt; I have Very thin, fine and flat hair.&lt;br /&gt; It made my hair shiny, smooth and it had much more volume at the root than usual.&lt;br /&gt; It rinses well and is does not weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is good, not too strong.  I will buy this shampoo in large size.&lt;br /&gt;Its rare that I get such good results with just shampoo...&lt;br /&gt;usually I have to use other products to get my hair to look this good.</li>
    <li> My hair is also falling out! I have have never done a review before BUT I feel like I need to speak up. After using this product for about 3 months I am also noticing clumps of hair falling out when I shower. Super scary. After a quick google I realized I am not the only person this is happening to. Please reconsider before buying this product.</li>
    <li> I tried this because of all the great reviews. I have naturally blonde-brown hair with wavy curls and want something that would make blowdrying my hair easier/faster and help eliminate the inevitable frizz that occurs once my hair is exposed to any amount of humidity. I have oily hair to begin with (can get away with washing every other day as long as i use dry shampoo and wear it up the second day). Well this made my hair oily by the end of the first day.  i tried my usual dry shampoo and it was still very oily and heavy the entire second day.&lt;br /&gt;it made my hair feel different when wet, but didn&#x27;t reduce drying time or reduce any of the frizz that comes along with living in the San Francisco summer fog. I would not purchase this again and am going to try to return to get my money back. Also posting this under the conditioner since i used them together.</li>
    <li> MY HAIR HAS BEEN STIFF AND BURNT LOOKING SINCE I STARTED USING THIS SHAMPOO.  AT FIRST I REALLY LIKED IT BUT MY HAIR IS FRIED.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo yesterday. Yeah, my hair is all soft and lovely, blah, blah, blah but that might be because I had to wash my hair with another shampoo and put conditioner in it to get the smell of this product out before I could even get to sleep! It stinks!! It smelled nice in the store, it smelled nice in the car when my friend asked to smell it, it smelled nice until I poured it in my hand and went to wash my hair with it. I don&#x27;t know what happened between bottle and hand but some evil force got in that bottle and did profane things with my innocent shampoo! It was like being at a dance for geriatric people and the smell of old man cologne and old lady perfume got together, did the lambada, and 9 months later out popped Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo! I&#x27;ve smelled a few vomit-inducing stenches before in my life but wow, I never in my life expected shampoo to smell so bad it could cause that!</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible. My aunt recommended this to me after she used it once and she told me it made her hair smooth and pretty after the first use. We have a similar hair type (wavy and dry) so i thought i would give it a try. Although i did like it at first, i noticed after a few weeks of use that my scalp was incredibly itchy  and had little red bumps, and my hair was getting very dry (side note: i am NOT allergic to any of the ingredients, i checked) so i switched to a dandruff shampoo and just used the suave conditioner. After my dandruff shampoo ran out, i decided to use up the rest of my  suave shampoo and now i wish i hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo made my hair very brittle and i noticed a lot of my hair falling out in the shower. It ruined my long silky hair because i had to cut so much off from dryness and breakage. No amount of leave in conditioner or argan oil would tame my hair after i got out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair that tends to get frizzy when blown out and then hot ironed, which makes it end up feeling like straw. I decided to try the Suave Keratin shampoo because it was really cost effective. I will say that it does a great job of making my hair straight with no frizz and I have been getting compliments but the next day my hair still straight feels dirty and greasy. With my type of hair I don&#x27;t like to shampoo every day it only damages my hair further. I will definitely not be making an additional pruchase</li>
    <li> ok. so i purchased the shampoo and conditioner with keratin.after the very first wash my hair was pretty smooth but all of the sudden i had split ends. my last haircut was a week ago. i was shocked.i took scissors and cut those dead  discolored split ends. in 2 days i washed my hair again.felt pretty smooth the first day ,but again ........i noticed split end. i had to use some leave in conditioner but honestly didn&#x27;t help either. .now i was wtf? the second day  my hair was so frizzy and the roots so greasy. I&#x27;m enraged.  it discolored my hair and pretty much distroyed. better not buy it. keratin has to be tested by a dermatologist. if suits your hair then used, otherwise noooooooooooooooo!</li>
    <li> I started losing a lot of my hair after a month of using this product. Very sad. Yes my hair was soft at first but it became dry and stringy. The product smells like coloring chemicals also. Nothing healthy about it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo I just bought my second bottle today. I have limp/fine hair which tends to get kind of knotty at the ends when it&#x27;s long. I used this shampoo daily for a week and each time I used it, I noticed more volume to my hair, it even looks longer (I know its not) but it looks so much better. I thought this stuff was supposed to straighten and smooth? well for my fine hair, this worked miracles. It really improved the overall look and manageability of my hair.</li>
    <li> Great price. Love the way it makes my hair feel (smooth and soft). Lovely, mild fragrance. Like that it comes in a 2pk. Great value!</li>
    <li> I picked this up because I had been eyeballing some other salon keratin treatments and I had a buy one get one free coupon. I have really soft, long semi wavy hair that gets frizzy with humidity or rain but I have ombre hair color so my ends are bleached and kind of dry. After using this once, I was  pleased with the outcome. My hair felt very soft and manageable, not to mention smelled nice. After about a week I started  to notice more hair in the shower than usual and my hair become unruly and hard to detangle. After two weeks my frizzy was unnatural, worse than it was  before even with no humidity! I went to my beloved hair stylist and asked what was  going on. Apparently there is such a thing as too much keratin in hair and it can&#x27;t make the hair shaft swell thus creating frizzy. Since my hair was  pretty healthy to begin with I didn&#x27;t need the extra keratin. I use it once a month for deep conditioning.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this, attached to the Suave Naturals I typically buy. I instantly fell in love with the product. I went out the next day and bought the shampoo and conditioner. It was really amazing, I loved the stuff! A couple of months go by, and my hair started falling out in clumps... literally CLUMPS 24/7. I would have sworn I would have been bald in 6 months at the rate I was going. My scalp got super itchy and I got really bad dandruff. I assumed it was because of something in my diet, perhaps a deficiency; I improved my diet. I even added Tea Tree oil to my shampoo to help with my scalp issues and for some strange reason, nothing ever got better. UNTIL I switched shampoo! I stopped using this product and my hair is no longer coming out in clumps. My scalp isn&#x27;t as itchy, and my dandruff has decreased dramatically. It&#x27;s kind of funny because I didn&#x27;t read about keratin reviews until AFTER I saw an improvement. This is so crazy! HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PRODUCT! Please do not use! It&#x27;s not worth the chance!!</li>
    <li> According to &#x27;WiseGeek&#x27; dot com, &amp;#34;Keratin shampoo is a hair care product designed to strengthen hair as it cleans. Manufacturers say that it tames frizz and makes hair less prone to breakage.&amp;#34; I had to look this up, because frankly, all I saw when I purchased it was the price (nice and low...) and &#x27;smoothing&#x27; in the name. Then I took one sniff of the product and fell in love with both the scent and the idea of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY EXPERIENCE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is color treated and is 30-50% gray underneath my unnatural medium brown. My hair is thick; almost coarse, and naturally very wavy - some would say curly. I&#x27;ve been having problems with hair loss, dry texture and breakage for months, which my doctor attributes to hormone fluctuations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had some success restoring the strength and moisture to my hair through supplements including Biotin 5000 mcg, but I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a shampoo that will consistently work its magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In using this shampoo I&#x27;ve found these things to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My hair it feels &#x27;sleek&#x27; to the touch after I use it. **Keratin infused products are supposed to be especially helpful to those who have hair that&#x27;s similar to my texture. Keeping a good moisture balance within the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If I use it for several days in a row without swapping it out for something else, my hair gets too soft and fly-aways occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Repeated use seems to have a negative effect on color treatments - shortening their duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again from WiseGeek regarding potential dangers of Keratin shampoos in general:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Some treatments, including certain brands of shampoos, contain substances such as methylene glycol and formalin. **Neither of which did I read in the ingredients of this product.** When exposed to heat, such as that from hot water or a hair dryer, these become formaldehyde gas. This substance is a known carcinogen, meaning that it has been linked to cases of cancer...Allergic reactions can occur while using these shampoos...severe itching and rash. Hair loss is sometimes reported when using these hair cleaners.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product very much, and for me, it&#x27;s doing wonders to the texture and feel of my hair when NOT used every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the reviewers who have issues with this product, would more than likely have problems with other Keratin infused products by other manufacturer&#x27;s too. It&#x27;s not necessarily this product, and it&#x27;s certainly not the fault of the reviewers, it&#x27;s simply not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------bstance is a known carcinogen, meaning that it has been linked to cases of cancer...Allergic reactions can occur while using these shampoos...severe itching and rash.

    <li> This shampoo make ones hair super greasy after one day or so! I wont buy it again! It is the same as the cream rinse..it is horrible!</li>
    <li> Words cannot express how much I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have frizzy wavy hair, and while the ponytail part is generally fine, the hair around my face generally is just so fluffy frizzy horrible and the ends are dry and static-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo and conditioner is just amazing; it moisturizes and softens my hair, and it radically reduces my frizz issues, while also magically not making my hair limp and flat.&lt;br /&gt;Another big secret, that I use with this conditioner too, that has really improved my hair quality, is \\&quot;co-washing.\\&quot; Use conditioner first, on the ponytail part and ends of the hair mainly, and let it sit in your hair while you&#x27;re showering. Then, rinse it out, and shampoo as normal. This helps your hair get so much more moisture from the conditioner, and still allows the shampoo to remove a bit of the dulling parts of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry, frizzy or unmanageable hair, you need to try this!</li>
    <li> About a week after I bought this product, my 11 year old daughter got sores on her forehead and all in her scalp.  After reading about the product online, I see that there are a lot of problems with this product.  I have made an appointment with the dermatologist to see what we can do to clear it up.  It should be pulled from the shelves.</li>
    <li> I would give this product 0 stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a local store and my two daughters and I have been using it for a little over two months.  At first, I did notice that my hair was smoother and shiny.  After the first month of use, I noticed a lot of hair breaking while I was combing the conditioner through my hair and during brushing.  I thought the damage was from my flat iron, so first I cut about 8 inches off my hair to deal with the damaged ends (it had been over 6 months since my last haircut) and then stopped using the blow dryer and flat iron for a month.  However, the breakage continued and started to alarm me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What tipped me off that the damage was being caused by the SHAMPOO and CONDITIONER was I noticed my 9-year-old&#x27;s hair starting to break like crazy and I saw lots of flyaways in her waist-length hair.  Her hair has NEVER broken like that before.  She NEVER heat styles her hair (not even with a blow dryer) and NEVER uses styling products.  After doing some Internet research, I discovered many other women having the same trobule with this shampoo and its accompanying conditioner.  I even read about some women&#x27;s hair falling out in clumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST TO BE CLEAR:  I am NOT confusing this product with Suave&#x27;s 30-day Keratin Smoothing System, which has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also spoke with a stylist and was told that ANY Keratin shampoo will make your hair dry, brittle, and breakage prone after prolonged use because the Keratin builds up on the hair shaft.  When I look at the broken hair that comes from my scalp, I can see the build-up and no, it&#x27;s NOT the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I pull my hair back into a ponytail, there are all kinds of flyaways from broken hair and it just looks terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s back to As I AM&#x27;s Coconut Cowash for me!  I will NEVER buy a Suave product again, nor will I allow a Keratin shampoo/conditioner product touch my hair EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, my teenagedaughter has not had the same trouble with this product.  Her hair is a different texture than my and my younger daughter&#x27;s hair.  My teenager&#x27;s hair is thick and straight, while my and my younger&#x27;s daughters is thinner and very wavy.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out why there was so much hair in the shower!  At first I blamed my son, who has long hair and is thinning on top.  I came onto Amazon to buy more of this, and then I read the 1 star reviews.  Yikes...it&#x27;s MY hair that is coming out.  Another thing that puzzled me was that that last time I colored my hair, my scalp burned, and that has never happened before.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because of the keratin shampoo, but I just threw all of my bottles away and will find something else.  It&#x27;s too bad, because I did like the way my hair looks, but I don&#x27;t like the way it looks sticking to the shower walls.</li>
    <li> I have damaged hair from previous treatment that makes it really frizzy. My hairstylist told me about keratin so I tried this shampoo and conditioner. I used it once and will never use it again. I have really thick and long hair and it made my hair extremely greasy like I had put shampoo in my hair and not washed it out. As soon as I blow dried my hair it looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in a week.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the conditioner as well. It smells great and made my curly hair so sleek and smooth. The price is great and no need to buy expensive shampoos anymore! I highly recommend trying it. I have not used the kit yet but so far very impressed.</li>
    <li> Used product CAREFULLY. Followed directions exactly.  Top of my scalp feels like a buzz cut.  Obviously a lot of my hair, on top of my head was chopped off or eaten away.  Oh, and my hair is NOT smooth or straight.  It SUCKS. I&#x27;m lucky I still have hair!  Would not use again!</li>
    <li> i bought this shampoo at walmart and have been using it for a month or so. i liked it, it made my hair less frizzy and shiny. and i didn&#x27;t need to wash it for 3 days which is unusual. then a couple weeks ago i started to notice my hair was falling out. in strands during the day, and in clumps when i combed it. i remember reading one girl&#x27;s review of how it fried her hair, so when i started thinking about it, i realized the loss was probably due to the shampoo. the more i use it and look, my hair is definitely falling out in clumps. maybe 10 strands at a time, maybe 3x per day. i have lots of fine hair and it&#x27;s pretty so i&#x27;m going to quit while i&#x27;m ahead! my scalp is burning just thinking about it.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it I loved it. My hair was soft and had less frizz. After a few times I noticed a waxy residue in my hair that would not come out. I didn&#x27;t associate it with the shampoo but now I realize that its the only thing it could be.for those who have the residue T-Sal works well. I really wanted to love this product.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before I bought this product to try, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by it.  I have highlighted, shoulder length hair that is naturally (meaning if I let it air dry after a shower) wavy and frizzy.  I use a different brand conditioner for color treated hair.  I straighten my hair every day with a flat iron.  I used this shampoo and on the first try, I saw a huge difference.  My hair was smoother and didn&#x27;t frizz in moderate-humidity.  I was headed to the shore the week after so I decided to put it up against the test of shore-humidity.  It did well!!  Not perfect, but I was very happy with the results.  My hair frizzed very little but it did \\&quot;curl up\\&quot; a bit.  I have had complements on my hair at work (I work in a non-air conditioned building so my hair is subject to the weather elements).  I have been telling people to try it for months now and the ones who have love it!  For a couple of dollars for a bottle, it is definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Over the years my hair has gotten drier and frizzier (even though salons say my hair is actually perfectly healthy). At any rate, I was absolutely amazed at the results.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is smoother, silkier and much MUCH softer. A total transformation. I RARELY take the time to write a review of something but had to do it for this product. It&#x27;s truly incredible. I just hope the ingredients aren&#x27;t as toxic as I suspect!!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product, but as a professional hair stylists I just want to tell you about at home keratin. Keratin is ment for damaged hair not dryness. Keratin like protein hardens hair so it can make your hair harder if your using it for dryness. also as hairstylist we tell you to use professional products for a reason they&#x27;re more expensive because they aren&#x27;t lab created products and they are more concentrated so they last longer. If you need help go see your local stylist we&#x27;re educated for a reason.</li>
    <li> Beware! I used only the conditioner luckily just one time! I was on an exfoliating kick and scrubbed all over in the shower with a wash cloth and mild soap. Had the conditioner in my hair as I always do when showering so it stays on for a few minutes, then rinsed, it must have just coated that freshly scrubbed skin. Next day I notice a rash starting on the back of my neck, within two days it gets really bad and spreads to my ears which feel swollen and hot. Slightly itchy, rough small bumps with redness and very uncomfortable, some on my scalp too. I couldnt figure out what was happening, something I ate?Now that I&#x27;ve read all these reviews I see I&#x27;m not the only one with a chemical reaction to this! This was the only thing different in my routine. Back to all natural products for me, and the Doc tomorrow! I normally use coconut oil on my hair, leave it on for an hour or more, then shampoo and condition with something natural and my hair will be smooth and healthy. But I fell for the &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; ads, super scary!</li>
    <li> I noticed my hair began to break at the ends even after a fresh trim after using the suave keratin shampoo and conditioner. I had been using it for months with no change in my routine when it began. I stopped using the product and it stopped. I used it again just to be sure that was the problem and sure enough began seeing the small pieces of hair in my sink after no sign of it for weeks. I liked this product at first. I am an African- American with medium coarse hair. Overall my hair is healthy.</li>
    <li> I have tried many shampoos and none have ever came close to this one! It leaves my hair silky smooth! I have never written a review but this shampoo is so worth. It! I use both shampoo and conditioner also the leave in conditioner ans the oil! I recommend this shampoo to everyone! All my friends are hooked on it now!</li>
    <li> At first, I really liked it but after a few uses I had an itchy scalp even maybe my entire body!?  So I looked up reviews to see what others thought and I&#x27;ve read a few people who experienced dry scalp.  Guess this is a no go for me!  Too bad I really liked the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and have NO IDEA how I will survive if they discontinue it.  I have tried (and had problems with) Renpure and Nexxus shampoos and conditioners, so I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try something that was a fraction of the cost.  This shampoo smells amazing, it lathers and cleans REALLY well, and it leaves your hair feeling super silky and light.  I have unruly/frizzy/wavy hair, and this product is able to keep it under control.  I am not exaggerating when I say that after shampooing it already feels like you&#x27;ve conditioned your hair as well.  This shampoo is great, and like I said it smells divine.  Save yourself the disappointment and some money and buy Suave over the more expensive brands.  I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months and initially thought it was the greatest product ever.  Made my hair shiny and silky.  Now my hair is falling out.  PLEASE be careful and watch the amount of hair you are losing now versus typical hair loss in a day.  I slowly started to notice it and now it is is coming out 10 or 12 strands at a time at the root.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for 3 months and I feel the need to condition after I use this conditioner. Makes hair feel soft while its in but when you rinse it out, there&#x27;s a waxy feeling build up. this build up makes my hair difficult to manipulate and it breaks easily finger combing, brushing, and combing. I bought the super-size bottles so I kept using it but i should have thrown it in the trash after the first bottle ran out. I&#x27;m going home today and getting rid of it and going back to Pantene relaxed and natural</li>
    <li> I tried this when it first came out then a few weeks ago I bought it again. A few months ago I had a coloring disaster which lead me to coloring my hair four different times in about a month. Anyway as you can imagine my hair was really damaged. I have thick, straight, medium length hair. I use the shampoo and conditioner combination. It seems like it rinses well and gets my hair clean, especially after the gym. I really do think it has improved the texture of my hair. I also use heat on it about five days out of the week. The reason I gave it a four star is because of the smell. It is not the best smell ever but it&#x27;s definitely not the worst.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T!! It has been discontinued by Unilever due to false advertising and disastrous results for many women. I had massive amounts of hair fall out during the process, but more importantly four months after use, my hair is ruined still. The product mostly rid me of my curls, but it left my hair a frizzy mess. It is STILL a frizzy mess, and my curls have not returned. And there are many women whose stories are much worse. Don&#x27;t use this product if you have a box sitting at home.</li>
    <li> I have to say I don&#x27;t even want to give this product one star. There are many chemicals in this product and my scalp is burning after just using it twice. It made my hair very soft and silky and bouncy, however, after reading all of the reviews, hands down, the people who used this product for longer periods of time all experienced either extreme hair changes or major hair loss, and only the people who used it for a short period of time, still seem excited about how silky and bouncy it makes their hair feel. It is apparent that this is a very dangerous product.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy, puffy, dry, cotton candy-like hair.  I tried the entire keratin system by suave, i was VERY excited, and wanted to like it.  It did nothing.  I previously liked suave, and continue to use their professional products (which ALL work better than the keratin line) at smoothing and moisturizing my hair.  This product is an utter disappointment.  To add insult to injury, it contains SULFATES!  Sulfates destroy keratin that is in the hair, HOW does that make any sense??</li>
    <li> I give it two stars just because I love the scent, and the way it made my hair smell. I noticed using it, it made my hair more dry, and less manageable! I was really disappointed, because sauve was always my go-to shampoo. Really disappointed, I suggest using Biolage, or Catwalk :/ really make my hair soft and awesome!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005SPETGS Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo, 12.6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;My 11 yr daughter developed a rash out of no where several months ago and was diagnosed with Keratosis Pilaris (An autosomal dominant skin condition in which a protein in the skin called keratin forms hard plugs within hair follicles) Sometimes it is worse than others. It wasn&#x27;t until this evening that I made the connection that the rash started right around the time I started buying Suave Keratin Infusion shampoo and conditioner, and flares up every time she uses it. I&#x27;m not saying this product \\&quot;caused\\&quot; her KP but I believe it may have provoked this to show up, and continued to aggravate it. I&#x27;m going to talk to her Dr about this, but I&#x27;d like to hear from others if they&#x27;ve had a similar reaction. I&#x27;ve also read a lot of reviews about people claiming this made their hair fall out, and I have noticed a considerable loss of hair myself since starting to us this product. It&#x27;s going into the trash immediately!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true what people are saying here.  My hair texture transformed from frizzy to silky and smooth.  But I noticed a lot of hair in the shower drain the 2x that I used it.  So I thought too good to be true and I read all the reviews.  Better to have frizzy hair than no hair at all.  This is a no brainer, had to trash it.  Thanks for all the honest reviews, you may have saved me...</li>
    <li> If I could I would give this no stars. I had heard that the 30 day keratin treatment had been recalled. So I thought to myself that using this shampoo, and conditioner would be fine, since they were still selling it. Boy was I WRONG!!! I have extremely healthy hair that is shiny, full, thick, and grows very fast. I used to have long hair that I cut off to donate to locks of love. But now I am holding on to my donation, because I feel like I&#x27;m going to be the one that needs a wig soon. I take care of my hair, I rarely use heat tools, hairspray, gels. Anyways, my hair started falling out, at a extremely rapid speed. I would literally wash my hair, and soo much hair would fall out that I would have to clean my hair catcher in the bathtub or else it my bathwater would not go down. I&#x27;m scared to do anything to my hair, because every time I touch my hair at least 3-5 strands will be in my fingers. Not only that but my scalp feels dry, itchy, and there&#x27;s a constant burning sensation. With my short hair now, I am losing more hair than I used to with my long hair. I am really concerned that my hair will not grow back, because when I look at the hair that falls out, the hair is falling out with the follicle. I literally can not do anything to my hair right now, I just wash, condition, brush, and that&#x27;s it. Even when I use bobby pins, hair will fall out when I take it out. My hair is so brittle, and weak now. I started taking a 2000mg dosage of biotin, and prenatal vitamins 2 weeks ago but have not seen any improvement. I am so disappointed, I don&#x27;t think that I will trust suave again for anything.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS OR ELSE YOU WILL BE FULL OF REGRET. PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF FROM THE CHANCE OF THIS EVEN HAPPENING TO YOU.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works great.  It makes my hair wonderful.  It is soft.  It is manageable.  Great product for curly hair to go straight.</li>
    <li> I use the shampoo, conditioner, and serum: they are amazing! I am 69, recovering from cancer &amp; chemo, and these products turned my hair from brittle and unmanageable to healthy and so easy to style. I have used many, much more expensive products, the Suave Keratin Infusion line is far superior. It appears that these products do not work well for everyone, but at this price, they are well worth a try. And, if your hair is similar to mine, they will be the best solution by far.</li>
    <li> I recently bought two small sample bottles of this product at Walmart. I have used it for 3 days now, and there has been a noticeable difference in how my hair looks and feels. My hair is still not completely frizz-free, but it does have more shine, feels softer, and lies smoother than before. I still have to add anti-frizz cream after I straight iron my hair (I use Suave Professionals Sleek Anti-Frizz Cream). I gave this product a 4-star rating because it does not entirely eliminate all of the frizziness. It is economical, smells like high-end salon shampoo, reduces frizz, and adds shine. If you have really unmanageable hair that tends to be frizzy, dry, etc. I would definitely recommend giving this shampoo a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using the suave professionals keratin dry shampoo and it has caused me to lose a lot of hair. Initially I thought it was because of stress so I looked up how to thicken hair and people were saying to use dry shampoo and to wash your hair less. I have fine and thin hair as it is so it freaked me out when it started falling out by the handfuls about a month after use. I DO NOT SUGGEST USING THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I wish you didn&#x27;t even have to give them one star! Recently, I purchased the shampoo and conditioner because my hairdresser told me the keratin would help my dry scalp. For the first couple of months I loved it. Around this time of year I &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; anyway so I didn&#x27;t think anything of it when my hair was starting to come out in the shower. But in the last 3 weeks the hair loss has increased dramatically. Yesterday I wore my hair up and you could see a tiny bald spot on top of my head at the part! How embarrassing! I&#x27;m 100% sure after reading all of these reviews this shampoo is the culprit. I&#x27;m 21 years old and once had thick pretty hair! Now I feel like If I kept using the shampoo id be bald by next Wednesday! Awful Awful Awful!</li>
    <li> Maybe its just my hair? I dunno but I have done a ton to my hair over the years. Now I just color my gray roots. After the first application, this product fizzed up and I could see the hair dye lifting in the bubbles. I rinsed out immediately. My hair color came out...looked splotchy and a significant amount of hair came out too. I had portions where the hairs were sticking up and short because they had broken off. I like suave but this product wrecked my hair.</li>
    <li> After using this product and blow drying my wavy hair straight I noticed that the crown of my head looked and felt greasy, like the conditioner wasn&#x27;t washed all the way out.  Thinking it was my mousse and anti frizz serum I didn&#x27;t use them the next time but my hair still looked and felt greasy then it occurred to me.....its the keratin shampoo\conditioner from Suave.  I will never buy this again and I will not be recommending it either.</li>
    <li> Two for the price of one.  Suave isn&#x27;t the best out there, but when pinching pennies at the end of the month.  I&#x27;ll do</li>
    <li> I have been growing out my hair for 5 years and I am heartbroken. After only washing my hair twice with the shampoo and conditioner, my hair started to fall out. My scalp burned and the product line smells bad. I am off to salon at the end of the work week to fix.</li>
    <li> I received the keratin smoothing treatment at a saloon and was not happy with the results; however, the recommendation to use this product and the conditioner has made a big difference on how soft my hair is. I love to brush my hair, it is healthy, shines and soft to the touch. I have been using this product for almost a year now and even when I put color on my hair I stay with this product and it makes a huge difference in how I feel about my hair.</li>
    <li> These sell for a great price and They shipped quickly. They are good to use to make Keratin treatment last longer.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product at first because it changed my hair.  But now I am afraid it is going in the trash.  I have been using it for several months and over the past few weeks my hair has just started falling out and I have been in tears nearly every day at the amount of hair going down the drain or covering my sink after styling.  I got home today and thought about Googling the shampoo - Oh. My. Gosh.  Please read up on this product before you buy it.  At least according to the Internet, there is a class action lawsuit going on regarding its sister product, the Suave Keratin Infusion system.  I wonder how long it will take for that to include the shampoos and conditioners.  I am actually on Amazon right now buying very expensive anti-hair loss shampoo and hair vitamins in order to try to save my long beautiful hair.  I hope it will not come to a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frizzy hair on humid days vs. no hair?  For me, I choose hair.  Sorry Suave.</li>
