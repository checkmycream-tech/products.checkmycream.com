    <li> I have used the expensive whitening gel that the dentist sells so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  The syringes are much larger than the ones I get from the dentist and so much cheaper.  I actually don&#x27;t mind the taste of these as much as I do with the expensive brands.  My mouth waters way too much from the flavor and/or peroxide of the expensive brand.  It happens with this brand as well, just on a smaller scale.  The gel works great.  However, the first time I used it, I guess too much overlapped the whitening tray and it seemed to whiten my gums as well (typical of a peroxide based cleaning agent).  I think this whitening gel works great, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a whitener, but if you are a habitual bleacher (every single day user), it might irritate your gums too much.  But if it&#x27;s a few times a week or less, this is a GREAT value and a great product.</li>
    <li> The viles are huge. You get so much for so little cost and it WORKS!! First time I used it the other night I seen a slight difference after 15 mins. It didn&#x27;t burn my gums or make teeth sensitive. The other 33% is horrible and literally burned my gums to the point they got white and raw. Never again. I am happy about my new find on Amazon. My roomate is now using it and loves it!</li>
    <li> Good results so far. 😀</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this product is doing to my teeth, besides whitening them, but it sure works for that.  I use it while I am showering so I can spit out the excess moisture that accumulates while I have the trays in place.  The difference is noticeable in just a few uses, but I do limit the use because I am fearful that it is somehow damaging my teeth  - it almost seems too good to be true, at this price and level of effectiveness.  Does not come with trays, you need to get those separately.</li>
    <li> These work fantastically! One syringe will take off years of discolor. Used small amount from one syringe each day 4 x week over 2 weeks and got about 5 shades whiter. Hardly any gum irritation. Great product and super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The cap never stays on so the gel slowly seeps out and makes a mess wherever you store it. Also when I got to the bottom of the tube, the black plunger melted and mixed in with the gel. Had to throw that tube away, who knows what the next one will do.&lt;br /&gt;Stay as far away from this product as possible. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> It works perfectly! It Camerún On individualy sealed packed. Recomend it to people who has a custom made tray for bleaching</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after review of several other brands and after having used Opalescence 15% in the past.  I would rate this product as excellent, was concerned a bit because of sensitive teeth issues but have had no bad experiences using this product.  Excellent results after only about four applications.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the quality of this product because of the exceptionally low price, but I was pleasantly surprised that it&#x27;s the real deal.  The only problem I encountered is that the product is supplied in very large syringes and it takes a little practice not to put too much into the trays.  But once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s a snap.</li>
    <li> No packaging, just 4 syringes in a mailer, with simple printed usage directions. But the price was sharp. I will refrigerate and hope that these are not expired.</li>
    <li> Although I ordered 22% gel I was sent 35% gel.  Initially I was apprehensive to use such a strong %.  Fortunately I wasn&#x27;t sensitive to it.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Affordable and effective.</li>
    <li> Actually scared to use it again. I thought it was a great price,&lt;br /&gt;But too strong for teeth. Made the inside of my lips break out, and a lot of sensitivity to teeth. Just considered the product a wash.</li>
    <li> I had my teeth whitened by the dentist and he sent me home with trays molded for my teeth and a couple of syringes of this.  Since then, I&#x27;ve been buying them here. It&#x27;s the same stuff, works great and is cheaper. I keep extras in the refrigerator until I need them.</li>
    <li> works perfect for a fraction of the price of others</li>
    <li> It works well but the solution is very strong....have to be very careful not to let it touch gums or they become painful and inflamed.</li>
    <li> Works well. Doesn&#x27;t make my gums sensitive either</li>
    <li> Burned the s*** out of my gums. With a little bit more of a warning before my gums turned white and sore, I would have given more stars. On the good side, it does whiten the teeth.</li>
    <li> bought the whole system and it works well, had run out and product was exact to what I originally purchased, works great. recommended.</li>
