      <li>The best hair conditioner out there.</li>
      <li>Perfect size travel bottle</li>
      <li>This one was not for me, but it works wonderfully on my friend&#x27;s hair who uses this also.</li>
      <li>I have used this for about a week now and its awesome on the condition of your hair.</li>
      <li>I tried all the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; and felt that this combination was the best for my hair.  </li>
      <li>According to directions you need 20 pumps per shampoo which makes it incredibly costly when compared to even salon products.</li>
      <li>My hair felt so good in the shower before rinsing it out, I wanted to just stay in and feel my hair for hours!</li>
      <li>but my scalp felt SOOO good!</li>
      <li>I recommend Joico moisture recovery over this which makes your hair beautiful.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I have it a chance it is wonderful and smells great!</li>

      <li>I love, love love,</li>
      <li>if it is okay</li>

      <li>But until then I will use more affordable products.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t buy it again, as it&#x27;s too pricey and did not give me the stunning results the ads promise.  </li>

      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why the heat made it better for me.</li>
      <li>And I love the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s ok,</li>
      <li>Ths is the most moisturizing of all the wens.  </li>
      <li>I love wen products, and chose this because it&#x27;s recommended for curly/wavy hair.</li>
      <li>tried it for a month no difference not for everybody i guess but its still an okay project.</li>
      <li>I love the WEN Cleansing Conditioner however I did not like the fragrance of the FIG and the pump on mine did not work.  </li>
      <li>Much better than shampoo</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this before committing.  </li>
      <li>its ok, like my stars say.</li>
      <li>I love Amazon because I can find trial sizes and give them a shot</li>
      <li>Let me just say how much I love Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Have had plenty of time to try out many hair products.</li>
      <li>&quot; I&#x27;ve been searching for a product to keep my hair moisturized ALL day, along with helping it to look \\&quot;better than the day before\\&quot; every day.</li>
      <li>and I must say my hair is fuller, healthier looking, shiny and looks better than it did yesterday :-)</li>
      <li>I was able to run a brush through my hair and have it manageable and non-frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I love love love this product.</li>
      <li>It will make your hair silky and healthy.</li>
      <li>Pleased.</li>
      <li>Wen is by far the best of shampoo free cleaners.</li>
      <li>I have been wanting to try Wen products for a while now, but didn&#x27;t really want to spend a lot just to test it, so I was happy to find these 6 oz bottles.</li>
      <li>However I think I need to try it more to be completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>Love the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel so good, clean, light.  </li>
      <li>My hair looked vibrant and smelled great.</li>
      <li>The fig smell is great if you love natural, earthy scents.</li>
      <li>Before that point my hair was always strong &amp; healthy.</li>
      <li>Best for dry hair or color processed.</li>
      <li>I have been using WEN for almost a year now and love, love, love the \\&quot;Sweet Almond Mint\\&quot; fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I am African-American and it works great on my natural hair.</li>
      <li>it would take significant time and products to coax it into looking just ok.</li>
      <li>I cannot wait to blow dry my hair out straight to see more wonderful results!I will make sure to update this review once I do so.</li>
      <li>Sooo glad I opted to test a 6oz instead of the full size 16oz.</li>
      <li>I purchased the fig because that was the one recommended for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>but I think it is well worth it to have healthy, strong hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is shiny and silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try to stay away from traditional shampoos and kept seeing the infomercial on this product and found a great deal for it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Has a milder scent than the shampoo fortunately.  </li>
      <li>My hair came out fabulous.</li>
      <li>On the commercial s they would show the ethnic girls and how their hair would look after the product and it looked great</li>
      <li>Tangles came right out, and I was able to style it with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and easy to comb, has a great scent, and leaves hair very shiny.</li>
      <li>I was initially very pleased with Wen--it made my hair very soft and kept it clean.  </li>
      <li>and I was excited to try it.  </li>
      <li>If you want to spend a lot of money to not get your hair clean, then this is the product for you.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so clean and feels like silk.</li>
      <li>(it wont hold a curl) was my world, and not due to using cheap products, I have spent money on the best products available, nothing worked.</li>
      <li>I am sticking to the \\&quot;Sweet Almond Mint\\&quot;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been so reluctant to try WEN because of numerous mixed reviews I have seen on youtube and various other sites. As well as the fact that I am African American and a product such as this who&#x27;s creator is a Caucasion male made me skeptical. I&#x27;mm just being honest so don&#x27;t crucify me.  I must say I was wrong. This product not only cleaned my hair and left it moisturized but my scalp felt SOOO good! I don&#x27;t know if there is eucalyptus or teatree in it but my scalp was so refreshed. Mr. Chaz Dean has a new customer because I will be repurchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel so good, clean, light.  I have thick curly hair and WEN makes it manageable.</li>
    <li> the only products that i will use are wen .... i have used it for years now &amp; love it&lt;br /&gt;this purchase was to introduce it to my 10 &amp; 8 year old Grandaughters &amp;#60;3 to Wen</li>
    <li> I had been thinking of trying Wen for the past 2 years or so.  I discovered that L&#x27;Oreal made a cleansing conditioner, for about half the price, which I could get at my local drugstore, so I started using that and was very pleased with the results.  Much better than shampoo -- it left my hair soft, silky, more manageable, with less frizz.  When I couldn&#x27;t find it in my drugstore, I decided maybe now&#x27;s the time to try Wen, so I ordered the 6 oz. bottle, to see if I liked it.  It&#x27;s great -- even better than L&#x27;Oreal!  I have long, thick, wavy hair, and it tamed and defined the waves beautifully. I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews in which people say it leaves their hair greasy.  I&#x27;m guessing they may have used the recommended 32 pumps, which seems like a lot.  I only use 12 pumps on my long, thick hair, and am very pleased with the results, plus I won&#x27;t run out of it so quickly. And I love the fragrance.  I&#x27;ll continue using Wen from now on -- it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman and I have been wearing my hair natural for the past four years.  My hair is as thick and course as it gets.  It looks nothing like the hair of the African American women on the commercial, it is kinky, nappy thick!  I usually wash my hair and double strand twist it in singles each week.  My product of choice has been Design Essentials.  When I first started going natural I tried many products and absolutely hated the way they made my hair feel.  Once I found Design Essentials I swore I would stick to it and not try anything else.  I did not want to become a product junkie.  So when I first saw the commercials about Wen I thought, no way.  My niece and I were up one night when the commercial came on again.  Wondering if it would work on our type hair, she dared me to try it and being the cool aunt that I am, there was no way I could back down from a dare.  I ordered the Fig, tried it and I instantly loved the way it made my hair feel.  I loved it.  I ordered the 6oz bottled thinking that if I didn&#x27;t like it I wouldn&#x27;t feel bad for throwing it away.  I will be ordering more, in a larger size along with the styling creme.  It is a bit on the expensive side for the number of pumps I have to use but I think it is well worth it to have healthy, strong hair.  I&#x27;m hoping overtime my hair will continue to grow and change as the product claims.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know how I would like it but I&#x27;m so glad I have it a chance it is wonderful and smells great! My hair is clean and moisturized with nothing dragging it down</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s my review of Wen products.  Nice.  But worth all the extra bucks...NO.  Sampled enough to know to stop.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try this since I started wearing my hair natural. I&#x27;m African-American and my hair is naturally curly and very dry. I wanted to try to stay away from traditional shampoos and kept seeing the infomercial on this product and found a great deal for it here on Amazon. The menthol in the product made my scalp tingle, and while it did make my hair feel clean, it also made it feel dry. I would like to give the tea tree oil one a try.</li>
    <li> I bought the Fig Cleansing Conditioner since it was recommended for dyed hair. I have very fine hair that tends to be limp if I don&#x27;t wash it every other day, and it&#x27;s dry and tends to split easily and won&#x27;t grow at all.   The Fig has no scent and the pump is pretty useless. However, after the first use I did not have to flat iron or blow out my hair for the first time in ages. I was able to run a brush through my hair and have it manageable and non-frizzy.  I only used maybe 10-12 pumps since the product is so pricey and my hair is only shoulder length. I loved the way it felt in the shower and towel drying it did not make it go crazy with it&#x27;s natural curls as regular shampoo does.   However, Biolage hair palmade makes my hair much more softer than Wen did. After a month of use, I see absolutely no difference in my hair than I did a month ago (with the aforementioned exception). I won&#x27;t buy it again, as it&#x27;s too pricey and did not give me the stunning results the ads promise.  It&#x27;s not the cure all, end all for hair products, but over-all, it was alright. Just not worth the money in the end.</li>
    <li> This particular sent stinks and it made my hair tangle more than it does when I just use normal shampoo and conditioner. And it made my hair color fade. I was  unsatisfied with this product. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that the other ones don&#x27;t work. But I also wouldn&#x27;t buy any of the other one either.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my niece who wanted to try it after seeing an ad. She has very thick curly long hair but the instructions say to use an absurd amount of product with each washing. She was thru this bottle in 3 days. And she was not impressed at all, I will not be buying this again. Very glad I purchased this on Amazon instead of the website to avoid the automatic enrollment.</li>
    <li> I love wen products, and chose this because it&#x27;s recommended for curly/wavy hair. If you&#x27;re looking for a curl specific wen product, stick with the lavender. The smell is so....unnatural? I can&#x27;t even handle using it. I appreciate natural products and a non-perfumed smell, but this doesn&#x27;t even smell like fig. Stick with a difference scent.</li>
    <li> I love the WEN Cleansing Conditioner however I did not like the fragrance of the FIG and the pump on mine did not work.  I would recommend the CUCUMBER &amp; the SWEET ALMOND.</li>
    <li> If you want to spend a lot of money to not get your hair clean, then this is the product for you.  Love the smell, but my hair feels dirty within hours of washing.  Would never recommend this anyone</li>
    <li> I ordered the 6 oz to try it before I fully commit to purchasing a full sized bottle. I received this product last Friday and I used it immediately. After my 1st wash and leave-in, my hair and curls were well defined. My hair looked vibrant and smelled great. Yesterday, I received a comment saying that my hair looked \\&quot;full of luster.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been searching for a product to keep my hair moisturized ALL day, along with helping it to look \\&quot;better than the day before\\&quot; every day. Today is day 4 and I must say my hair is fuller, healthier looking, shiny and looks better than it did yesterday :-). I cannot wait to blow dry my hair out straight to see more wonderful results!I will make sure to update this review once I do so. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Product smells god awful, similar to cough syrup. According to directions you need 20 pumps per shampoo which makes it incredibly costly when compared to even salon products. I have course, curly hair and saw absolutely no results. This cleansing conditioner was no more effective than any drug store brand.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try Wen products for a while now, but didn&#x27;t really want to spend a lot just to test it, so I was happy to find these 6 oz bottles. I received my order in 2 days, I&#x27;ve only tried it once, but hair seems really shiny. I have really thick, coarse hair that has to be blow-dried and flat-ironed, after using this the one time, my hair needed less flat-ironing and felt so soft. I&#x27;m anxious to see how does after using it for a while!</li>
    <li> I have used Wen before in the past and liked it for my hair.  Not using a cleanser with chemicals in it appeals to me. However, this an expensive product and using it exclusivly is not finanically possible for me.  So I buy it wen i can.</li>
    <li> do not like it, doesn&#x27;t work for me, would not buy again. so said Wen over rated, do not like it</li>
    <li> I like the tingly sensation it leaves on your head after you have it lathered up. My hair feels clean and vibrant!</li>
    <li> It works good it you use it correctly,made my hair soft, but since you have to use so many pumps it was used up very quickly.</li>
    <li> Wen is by far the best of shampoo free cleaners. It will make your hair silky and healthy. It will not give you any volume.  Best for dry hair or color processed. If you have oily hair stay away it will make your hair feel heavy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the big hype is about this product.  I mean for it to cost as much as it does.  I like the idea behind it being better for your hair but for the cost and the amount you are told you use, its outrageous.  I am a black woman with very curly hair.  I used this product and my hair felt...good... but just as good as it feels when I use anything else.  I wonder if a difference would be really noticeable if I were to want to flat iron it straight or something because wearing it curly, there didn&#x27;t seem to be any less chance of my curls eventually frizzing up if I didn&#x27;t help it out with an additional product.  It did seem to detangle it well but so did the Hair One product from Sally&#x27;s and it was way cheaper.  I bought the 6oz bottle ($20+ with shipping) just to check it out...and it lasted me 2 washes.  It calls for 20-30 pumps...like I said... 2 washes.</li>
    <li> Perfect size travel bottle it&#x27;s much easier to refill than the 2oz travel size and love the pump and smell as well as it works wonders on my very long hair no tangles</li>
    <li> I really like Fig and Tea Tree Oil.  I tried all the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; and felt that this combination was the best for my hair.  It leaves it shiny and very manageable.</li>
    <li> Let me just say how much I love Amazon.  I love Amazon because I can find trial sizes and give them a shot so I don&#x27;t have to sign up for some product&#x27;s monthly delivery that I may be billed for even after I cancel.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this before committing.  I was very excited about trying this product with hopes it would help with managibility and help my color last longer.  I thought this lousy 6oz bottle was $6.99 when I bought it, not $16.99.  Holy crap!!!  For shampoo!!!  OK, so once I processed the shock, I thought, &amp;#34;Well, if it really does what it shows on the infomercial, it could be worth it.&amp;#34;  After I used it the first time, I thought I must have done something wrong.  So I read the instructions, (like you should need to read instructions for shampoo) and I left it in long enough, but I didn&#x27;t comb it through.  I made sure comb it through the next time I used it.  I purchased the fig because that was the one recommended for fine hair.  I&#x27;m surprised no one has mentioned the truly nasty odor of it, it smells medicinal, like I dumped a bottle of cough syrup on my head.  And the tingling to the scalp was not pleasant, but it wasn&#x27;t horrible.  The results were as close to the infomercial as much as a picture of a BigMac looks anything like what you actually get.  My hair was slightly less frizzy, but not by much.  Nothing like the &amp;#34;before and afters&amp;#34; on TV.  I checked the prices on the bigger sizes of product too just to see if I was paying a lot more per ounce because it was a trail size.  I wasn&#x27;t.  I got five washes out of my size ounce size, only washing my hair once each time.  No matter what size you buy you&#x27;ll roughly be paying $2.00 per wash.  ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!!!  It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve come across such a total scam as this.  Save your money and avoid being a dupe like me.</li>
    <li> My hair is natural 3b/c, My hair is naturally thin, soft with slightly dry ends . I only like Wen Fig when I do a roller set. I Co-washed and used as a leave in. Applied a little oil on my ends and set my hair on large hard rollers and set under a hood dryer for an hour on low heat. I do not take the rollers out but let them set without heat and test to make sure my hair is complete dry.  My hair came out fabulous. Now I used Wen for a wash and go and it was not good. Dry, Frizz  and Coated. Don&#x27;t know why the heat made it better for me. Because of the price I will not purchase again. If it was cheaper I would but only for roller sets,</li>
    <li> Its the only Wen cleansing conditioner I could find without aloe barbadensis.&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, I couldnt use my favorite WEN products! I developed some freak allergy to aloe vera/aloe barbadensis and mango, and suddenly my beloved Wen was making me itch like crazy! there are others out there in this allergy family so I hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Wen for having one without aloe.</li>
    <li> Wen works my hair looks better, but because of the high price of the product and the fact that I have short hair I probably will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Has a milder scent than the shampoo fortunately.  Works well, but not sure if I would order again.  May get a different scent.  Not so fond of the fig shampoo it is rather strong and unpleasant.</li>
    <li> The only thing I could say bad about this product is that it makes my hair so full.  I see myself being a wen girl.  I did not realize how dry my hair was with the shampoo I was using till after I used the wen.  Love the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Lots of pumps is needed so for this size it&#x27;s gone pretty quick. Would recommend but the larger size.</li>
    <li> Chaz Dean has done a wonerful job with this shampoo.  This product delivers!  This is my second bottle and my hair gets better and stronger after each use.  I will never go back to regular shampoo. My hair is shiny and silky smooth.</li>
    <li> total waste of money, dries hair out, im 48 with colored hair, had a friend use it who is 20, she hated it too</li>
    <li> this product is really good for ethnic hair.  Makes my hair soft and easy to comb, has a great scent, and leaves hair very shiny.</li>
    <li> I ran out of hot water by the 6th pump.  I lost count somewhere around 12.  At the recommended 30 pumps, this 6 oz bottle is a single-serving.  I don&#x27;t think it is cleansing, but my hair sure is soft.  I may have to buy some other shampoo to actually cleanse my hair.  Or shave my head completely.  We&#x27;ll see how tomorrow turns out.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. I have 4b, 4C type hair. I felt like I had a new head of hair. My hair was very soft and detangled. I have really think hair so I use a lot. I&#x27;m saving to purchase a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely dislike this product. It did nothing at all for my hair. No tight curls,no shine and no moisture. I am pissed right now and I regret buying this product. On the commercial s they would show the ethnic girls and how their hair would look after the product and it looked great so im like hey im black, I have course hair,ill try it. They dont tell you that then b!+#hes be mixed. Im fully black. Im not half white,or german,or Indian or any of that stuff. Im AFRICAN AMERICAN. They should really have used better models. I feel so swindled. PS I only rated one star cuz if I didn&#x27;t I couldn&#x27;t post this</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter for a Christmas Present and don&#x27;t know how she liked it yet.  But it came quickly and in good shape.</li>
    <li> wen works great with my hair and i wanted to try a new scent. i ordered the fig and i tried out today and i was surprised to find that the conditioner smells like barbeque sauce...im a vegetarian and when i go into the shower expecting t smell like fruit and walk out smelling like burning pig...im dissappointed. dont try this unless you want to smell like a barbeque.</li>
    <li> Without fail anytime i usd i get all kinds of complements.i lovvr the scent and the cost and buyiing opion</li>
    <li> It came on time.  I love this product.  I am mixed so my hair is really hard to manage sometimes, but this helps so much.  My winter dry hair with frizzies is gone.  My hair is super soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> I tried it for the first time on Wednesday, and I like the results. My hair is shiny and bouncy, without feeling greasy or weighed down. Tangles came right out, and I was able to style it with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use approximately 20 pumps (can&#x27;t they concentrate it?!), but it sounds more than what it really is. I normally use about 10 pumps of regaular conditioner anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll report back after a few times of using it, to see how it works over the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, this product did not work for me. After a while my hair felt greasy and looked limp.  I&#x27;d rather stick to shampooing twice a week and using hair powder in between for a fresher look.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a week now and its awesome on the condition of your hair. But after 2 days noticed large amounts of hair shedding in the shower. Thought it was just me so i kept going on using the product with the same results great hair, but terrible shedding. My pillow had hair all over it...which has NEVER happened even when sick or stressed. I guess I am not alone in this. I have read message boards about hair loss due to Wen. I am so upset because my hair matters especially since I am a Hair  Stylist. So very sad that a product that claims to actually HELP stimulate HAIR GROWTH,  does the opposite. I am now forced to cut my already short thin hair even shorter. I recommend Joico moisture recovery over this which makes your hair beautiful. Nothing could have prepared me for the thousands of strands of hair missing. This was only ONE WEEK! Imagine if I had not stopped. The product also made my scalp feel on fire with random sores here and there. I can only hope my hair will grow back! :O(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing. It smell different than fig.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what I expected but &amp;#34;shampooing&amp;#34; your hair with conditioner is a novel concept anyway???! Didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the look or feel of my hair. Would not recommend, you could probably experiment with your own conditioner to see if you like what you get.</li>
    <li> I did not care for the product. My hair felt chalky and coarse, I have fine hair. I will never purchase this product or ec commend it.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims!  I wish i could afford to use it regularly.  The only downside is the cost.  I honestly bought the smallest amount I could thinking it wouldnt work but it did!</li>
    <li> Never before had any hair product as ideal for my naturally wavy, dry hair. And I&#x27;m not 29. Have had plenty of time to try out many hair products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review as I comb my coarse natural 4b/c hair. Before WEN (I used Fig tonight and I bought Pomegranate too) I could not manage to comb my own hair myself, a 25 year old. Mom or hairdressers had to contend with the &amp;#34;bush&amp;#34;. Now I&#x27;m super glad to say (after almost plaiting decently a whole section of my hair all by myself, mom&#x27;s asleep) that WEN is the product to beat when it comes to softening and hydrating my hair. If you are of African descent as well with coarse type 4 hair, this is the product to stop the &amp;#34;product junkie&amp;#34; lifestyle. The fig smell is great if you love natural, earthy scents.</li>
    <li> I really expected a miracle just like the commercial.</li>
    <li> I was initially very pleased with Wen--it made my hair very soft and kept it clean.  After about 4 washings, Wen started to dry out my hair--making it frizzy and fried-looking. I have color-treated hear, and my roots started to look orange and brassy. I was hoping to love this product, but no such luck!</li>
    <li> The product sucks and does nothing like they tell you on tv. Transaction was great but the product is self is not good. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> Bought this over a year ago and loved it. The price prohibitive however so tried just using some really good conditioners and NO shampoo for the last year. Works just as well... like Aussi 3 minute miracle etc... deep conditioners etc. Just remember to cut out the shampoo. Your hair won&#x27;t squeak when you cleanse it because you won&#x27;t have stripped it. However, it will feel like beautiful [and clean] heavy silk. If you can afford Wen go for it, but I tell you, the other way works too.</li>
    <li> feels great when I&#x27;m washing your hair with it, but leaves my hair feeling tight and harsh. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because its so expensive and u get like 2 uses out of the 6 ounce. They should label it travel size. As for the product it was good. I am African American with relaxed hair and I do notice a difference with moisture. My hair is softer after using this product. However I think I need to try it more to be completely satisfied. But I dont think it should be that expensive.</li>
    <li> I used this following directions on back and it made my hair oily. I have medium thick wavy hair. I ended up giving this to my mom who has straight coarse hair and she liked it. It&#x27;s also very pricy.</li>
    <li> I have been using the WEN Products for while now. I am African-American and it works great on my natural hair. I usually use the Sweet Almond Mint but I decided I would try the Fig. I didn&#x27;t really care for the Fig smell. It smells somewhat like medicine but I can say I have tried the Fig but overall I like the Sweet almond mint better (smell and how it makes my hair feel). Good Luck</li>
    <li> The best hair conditioner out there.</li>
    <li> Very small container but the product was great. Only lasted a few weeks even with my short hair BUT liked the product. It came packaged really well. Pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN for almost a year now and love, love, love the \\&quot;Sweet Almond Mint\\&quot; fragrance.  I have long med. to thick wavy hair and this product works fabulous on my hair type.  I recently tried \\&quot;Fig,\\&quot; not as pleased.  It didn&#x27;t seem to give my hair the same body.  But that&#x27;s ok, I just wanted to try a different fragrance.  I am sticking to the \\&quot;Sweet Almond Mint\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I purchased Wen based on the recommendations I read on the longhaircareforum.  I have naturally curly/coily 4A thick hair so I thought that Wen would help bring much needed moisture to my hair.  Wen was ok but not good enough to justify the high price tag.  I n addition to the Fig, I purchased the Pumpkin spice version from QVC and saw little difference but thankfully Wen has a 30 day return policy. Based on what I read on the Beauty Brains blog, I purchased VO5&#x27;s conditioner for 0.85 and felt that my hair was softer and smoother than when I used Wen.  In fact,  I purchased the olive oil version of Hair One at a fraction of the cost and didn&#x27;t really see any difference.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27; wash out color like it says but i didn&#x27;t noice improved softness, shine, or body. otherwise it was okay. i did decide to give them another chance and bought a complete care system. if it is okay then i will go back to my products i am currently using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Wen for a long time so when this Fig version came on sale (love Fig!) and had a little extra funds, I ordered in high hopes.  Was Not Disapointed. The fig scent is only really obvious to you went in the shower, so guys....you can use this too.  Actually only can only slighty scent it when someone else has used it when you&#x27;re up close (like getting/giving hugs).</li>
    <li> I am not sure I like the product yet. There is certainly no betterment in my hair&#x27;s appearance, and it&#x27;s a hassle to use.&lt;br /&gt;I may order it another time, but for people with thing, body lacking hair to begin with, it&#x27;s not that beneficial.</li>
    <li> Uh yea I don&#x27;t really know about this stuff i think carols daughter would do me better for me because i didn&#x27;t really see any difference in my hair maybe i need to get another kind tried it for a month no difference not for everybody i guess but its still an okay project.</li>
    <li> My hair is especially damaged from using several bleaching kits back to back. Before that point my hair was always strong &amp; healthy. Very resilient for the hair of someone who dyes often. Since then I&#x27;ve had a lot of problems with my hair locking up after shampooing &amp; being impossible to brush. Thanks to WEN I am no longer experiencing those issues though. Nor am I having problems with my scalp getting dry which was an issue in the past.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I have thick hair that tends to get more dry as I&#x27;ve aged. So I look for good hair products that moisturize but also make my hair look good. Yes, WEN Fig works really well with my thick, dry hair. I purchased just a small 6oz bottle to test. It didn&#x27;t last long. My hair is long so the directions suggested that I use up to 30 pumps. I only used about half and it covered my hair well. I wash my hair every other day to avoid the dryness. That small bottle was gone after 4 washes. So, yes, WEN works really well for dry, thick hair. Sadly, you will go broke just washing your hair. I&#x27;ve found other products that work equally as well for a fraction of the price. Hopefully some time in the future this product will be priced at a reasonable rate. But until then I will use more affordable products.</li>
    <li> its ok, like my stars say. i could some difference with my hair, but cant put it in words. i do feel that if i could use it more regular there might be different results. but unfortunately, it is too expensive for me to use regularly.the price here at amazon was an oppurtunity to experiment though.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen for quite a few years now and love the Pomegrante (not fig).&lt;br /&gt;I have also used the sweet almond.  This is good stuff for your hair.</li>
    <li> Wow. I am almost speechless, but here goes anyway! I love, love love, this product. I was skeptical because of the varying reviews, but decided it was worth a shot because my hair is truly awful, I doubted anything could actually make it look worse. It was always kinda okay when I was younger, but after turning 40, it just hit the wall and has been going downhill ever since. My hair is thin, fine, and prone to frizz and breakage. With normal products, I have only been shampooing every 2-3 days because just washing was hard on it. I have an oily scalp but the hair at the ends is dry and prone to breaking. So...not washing made it look dirty, over-washing made it frizzier and break more. After it would air dry (a hair dryer is out of the question) it would take significant time and products to coax it into looking just ok. Flatness, frizz and lack of shape (it wont hold a curl) was my world, and not due to using cheap products, I have spent money on the best products available, nothing worked. I hated to look in the mirror, I felt like I had a little bird&#x27;s nest forming by my part all the time, it was always flat and messy looking, it was effecting my self-esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this in the mail yesterday, so my review is from one use but I am convinced this will only make my hair better with time. My hair felt so good in the shower before rinsing it out, I wanted to just stay in and feel my hair for hours! I used this according to the youtube video and really concentrated on the massaging in. It did make my scalp tingle, in a good way. A bit more hair came out in the shower than usual, but I attribute that to the massage time as I normally dont do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the amazing part. When combing at the mirror (and the combing was a breeze even without a detangler) only about 3 more hairs came out, but even more amazingly, the broken hair pieces were about a total of 5 instead of dozens! When it was drying, it felt different, and when it was finally dry, it had a semi-shape to it! Previously, think of flat hair for 8 inches then about four inches of a wedged-out dry-looking frizz ball. The next miracle, I was able to use my fat curling iron on it and it actually held the shape, no texturizer used. When I was done, I couldn&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror, I actually like what I am seeing and I think it makes me look a few years younger! This is even showing up in pictures! And it feels amazing. I also bought the cucumber aloe and will try that when this is gone. If my opinion changes after use, I will update this post, but for now, I am actually in stunned amazement with this product, its worth every cent.</li>
    <li> This product leaves hair greasy and limp.  I tried one other from this company and it was just as bad.  I tried to give this away and couldnt give it away. Save your money.</li>
    <li> IT DID NOT MOISTURZE MY HAIR IT DID NOT LEAVE MY HAIR THE WAY I WANTED IT. IM NOT GOING TO BY AGAIN</li>
    <li> i did not get the Fig fragrance. another fragrence was sent.&lt;br /&gt;I was going away and needed to take it with me so did not return it.</li>
    <li> Ths is the most moisturizing of all the wens.  I&#x27;d only ever buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Totally not worth the money! The scent is awful and it does not moisturize. I will stick with Shea Moisture. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Wen girl, but Fig is not for me!! It makes my hair sooo dry. As soon as I get out of the shower I have a halo of fuzz around my head. It&#x27;s not soft at all and that fuzzy look stays with you during and after styling also. I even use anti-frizz hairspray, but nothing tames the frizzies after using Wen Fig! Sooo glad I opted to test a 6oz instead of the full size 16oz.</li>
    <li> The product itself works well, but the fragrance is just as some other reviewers stated--like cough syrup.  It does fade and become less noticeable after drying, but the smell is a real turn off.  Maybe if they left out the \\&quot;mint\\&quot; portion it would be better. I will use it up as it is expensive, but will not by this fragrance again.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult for a black woman with coarse hair to find good products. My hair is usually dry and brittle. I was pleasantly surprised by the results. My hair was moisturized with natural curl and very little frizz. But! I can&#x27;t afford WEN even at amazon prices so I might purchase this once more to use for special occasions but not regularly.  I would suggest it if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended I try this product,  told me it won&#x27; lather like regular shampoo.  They were right about not having all the lather, actually felt creamy. When I did as the directions tell you.....Wow!  My hair is so clean and feels like silk. From now on will never use shampoo again, only Wen. My color treated hair now shines without becoming dull....guess it keeps the color longer.  Now I want to try all their other products....&lt;br /&gt;Liked it so much I used it on my tiny dog...he is softer than he has ever felt.  Learned Wen has a product for animals, that will be my next purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Guess you can tell I&#x27;m sold on this product...</li>
    <li> I love it!! I can tell the difference using it.</li>
    <li> The only thing was the bottle had leaked a little bit during shipping, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. All good besides that.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, from what commercial and emails have mis inform many of us, yet I will used but will not buy again</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and always needed a lot of conditioner. Wen works great for my hair. It looks so much healthier after I blowdry and style. You do have to use a lot of the product each time but for me it&#x27;s worth it. I even started using it on my 2 year old and now after her baths I have no trouble brushing through her long hair. No more tears!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for some time and finally ordered it. It wasn&#x27;t as great as everyone has made it out to be. I have long baby fine hair and it makes my hair feel heavy. I used much less that it calls for, but still very heavy. My hair also just doesn&#x27;t feel real clean like it did with regular shampoo. I might use this once a week or so for a good condition, but it&#x27;s too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Was hoping to smell a surprise when I open this but I think all Wen cleansing conditioner kind of smell the same. I have been using the sweet almond mint for the past two weeks and I am hoping to try Fig before I confirm my 90 day package with Wen online. Some what dissapointed with the smell.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my natural coily curl hair. It seems to have dried my out by the end of the day and made it look puffy. I added more essentail oil when styling it the next day and still got the same result. This one was not for me, but it works wonderfully on my friend&#x27;s hair who uses this also. Her hair is natural and loose curls but not a coily curl like mine.</li>
    <li> This is a total rip-off.  I had heard really great things about the Wen brand and I was excited to try it.  I like how it was all natural with no harsh chemicals etc. and I really wanted to like it.  I got this Fig version because I read it was especially helpful for curly hair, which I have.  And I got the 6oz size to try it out before I bought more due to its high price.  Like I said in my header, don&#x27;t waste your money.  The directions say 20-30 pumps per use... so about 3 uses, at $20.00 a pop you have got to be kidding me.  I have not noticed any difference in the condition of my hair, if anything it&#x27;s more frizzy and dried out.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 6oz size to try and I love it. I will definitely order the larger size. This is what I needed for my dry hair</li>
</ol>
