### Positive Reviews

      <li>These are so great for cleaning invisible braces!!</li>
      <li>What a wonderful product!</li>

      <li>Great Product ....</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t find them very effective in removing any plaque or truel providing any cleansing at all.</li>
      <li>One of the best and most durable mouth guards that I have bought.</li>
      <li>I think I am going to buy more for home!I Great value!!</li>
      <li>and they did a really good job cleaning it.</li>
      <li>It seems to do a fairly good job of cleaning as well.</li>
      <li>For me, the soak doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as the wipes.  </li>
      <li>Seems to work great, love the smell.  </li>
      <li>taste of this is fairly nice.</li>
      <li>You can soak your retainers or mouth guards in Hydrogen Perozide over night, and it would be just as effective in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping great price!</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and minty but there is virtually no taste.</li>
      <li>I really liked the cleaning that these wipes gave my mouthguard.</li>
      <li>They allow you to gently &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; the mouthguard and leave a very pleasant toothpasty smell/taste.  </li>
      <li>Work good and easy to use</li>
      <li>Very easy to use</li>
      <li>A great idea that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>And the fact that you get 2 for what I paid for one, is even better.</li>
      <li>I love these cloths.  </li>
      <li>but my night guard tastes much better after cleaning it with one of these.</li>
      <li>Seems to work okay.</li>
      <li>He said this is a great product as it cleans his retainer but also leaves a clean, fresh taste.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a pretty good option</li>
      <li>These may work better for simpler mouth guards with smooth surfaces (maybe)</li>
      <li>This is where Efferdent&#x27;s Fresh Guard wipes comes in handy.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t work quite as well as hoped at getting the white gunk off, but still nice to know her retainers are clean in between good cleanings.</li>
      <li>wipe is a nice large size that easily cleans out a guard or retainer, then toss.</li>
      <li>The wipes are easily transported and give a nice clean and minty feeling to the apparatus as well as a fresh clean feeling to one&#x27;s mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just getting ready to order some more boxes!</li>
      <li>Wipes, great idea to quickly freshen the retainers in between the major cleanings!</li>
      <li>We have two in our home that use retainers for maintenance of their lovely smile.</li>
      <li>Easy to carry and keeps my daughters retainers clean on the go.</li>
      <li>They are especially great when one plans to be away a few days.</li>
      <li>When at home, I can use the Fresh Guard soaks for a more thorough cleansing.  </li>
      <li>Convenient, easy to use, and no bad taste or aftertaste.</li>
      <li>This is super easy to use.  </li>
      <li>No, but I would keep some on hand for travel and tucked into a purse or pocket in case they are needed to clean something off when we are out.</li>
      <li>, I use this for storing the braces until I can get some clean water to rinse them out.</li>
      <li>My mouth guard always felt clean when I wore it at night, even cleaner than washing it with soap and water.  </li>
      <li>I wear retainers and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for options to clean it after meals or when I don&#x27;t have quick access to clean water.</li>
      <li>Each wipe is only good for one use.</li>
      <li>I also tried the Fresh Guard soaking product which is available at the drug store.  </li>
      <li>This does the trick as far as making it taste better, but it&#x27;s not an easy method to follow when travelling.  </li>
      <li>No mess, and they clean well and leave a nice, fresh taste.</li>
      <li>use mine for a mouth guard and the results were a fresh and clean apparatus</li>
      <li>This has helped tremendously.  </li>
      <li>I originally got free samples from the dentist, and he really likes them.</li>
      <li>I have tried many of them ,since having my new bridge put in</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but then I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be and to be honest, I&#x27;d be more than a little leery of something that would remove all the yellowing immediately.</li>
      <li>I ordered the Fresh Guard Wipes for my husband as he wears a retainer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with them so far.</li>
      <li>Fresh Guard Wipes are a great way to keep those retainers and other mouth pieces fresher and better maintained than with a regular toothbrush.</li>
      <li>discolor easily and finally a product that is easy to use and gives him the confidence that he has cleaned the guard per the dentists recommendations.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really speak for how well they actually clean</li>
      <li>I wear a mouthguard at night for TMJ, and keeping it clean was a real hassle until I came across these wipes.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s where they really came in handy, as she was able to really refresh her braces when out and about, after lunch hour at work, after eating at a restaurant, or anywhere else you need something to wipe down a plastic mouthpiece.</li>
      <li>These work great, especially when used alongside a weekly soak (same brand).</li>
      <li>The fresh guard was ok but because I have Invisaligns which do not have a smooth surface, it was hard to clean out all the nooks and crevices.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a better option then brushing your retainer and possibly breaking it.</li>
      <li>I love the minty smell and the fact that the sheets themselves are quite big but still; need a rinse.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s working even better than I hoped, and my only concern was the bacteria that was probably building up on it.</li>
      <li>First I put the retainer under the water and then used these wipes</li>
      <li>The only thing that would keep me from buying more is price.</li>
      <li>well and they are large enough to really clean a full set of dentures.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>He uses Fresh Guard every night to clean his upper and lower bight guard.  </li>
      <li>Definitely does the trick for freshening up an item that is frequently easy to neglect.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll have to cram it into the more small areas, but it will fit everywhere.</li>
      <li>It comes in prepackaged squares which are easy to open.  </li>
      <li>I tried soaking it in mouthwash overnight, but I&#x27;m not sure how effective that was, so I decided to try the Fresh Guard wipes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This would get a little pricey for daily use, as in a retainer or night grinding guard, but it would be great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cloth cleans very well and is so convenient.  </li>
      <li>and I found them very convenient.</li>
      <li>Just tear open a pack of these wipes and clean it up.  </li>
      <li>The Fresh guard wipes are great to throw in a pocket or keep on the sidelines because mouth guards get kind of disgusting.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This will get into most of the crevices and areas of the average guard.</li>
      <li>Most of the others that I have tried , split or grind down or fall apart</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>You can wipe your guard down and it won&#x27;t be insanely strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a really great / easier/ less messy alternative to using the drops that dissolve in water, especially when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
      <li>I think this would be a great product to take if you are traveling, but it would be too expensive to use on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>These are a life saver to keep partial plates and dentures or protectors fresh</li>
      <li>mo1CB15KBOWBA0U]]I recently got a custom made mouth guard for my upper teeth to help prevent any more damage due to my gnashing my teeth together.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re soft enough to get down into the nooks and crannies of the mouth guard, and it only takes a minute or two to clean the mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the long run, I&#x27;ll probably go with a liquid soak overnight, maybe the Fresh Guard Soak product, but for now I&#x27;m happy to use the wipes to disinfect my mouth guard and get rid of all the nasty stuff that builds up on it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seems to work great, love the smell.  I actually use a toothbrush to help get the cloth in the grooves.  Seems to work okay.</li>
    <li> One of the best and most durable mouth guards that I have bought. I have tried many of them ,since having my new bridge put in and I use them so I don&#x27;t grind my teeth at night. Most of the others that I have tried , split or grind down or fall apart and I have had this one for months and none of what has happened with the others has happened. And the fact that you get 2 for what I paid for one, is even better. You get 2 for the price of one and they last way longer than the expensive ones.</li>
    <li> This has helped tremendously.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get rid of the white crud so I thought it was staining the night guard since no amount of brushing would remove it.  This product has gotten almost all of it off.  I also tried the Fresh Guard soaking product which is available at the drug store.  For me, the soak doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as the wipes.  I&#x27;ve begun alternating the two solutions in an attempt to keep costs down.</li>
    <li> These work great, especially when used alongside a weekly soak (same brand). Just getting ready to order some more boxes!</li>
    <li> These work great for my son to take to school, and wipe his mouth piece out after he&#x27;s eaten.  I originally got free samples from the dentist, and he really likes them.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great price! Can&#x27;t find these in my town so will be purchasing again! Thanks!</li>
    <li> These are so great for cleaning invisible braces!! Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> These are great for cleaning retainers that cannot be cleaned with toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I really liked the cleaning that these wipes gave my mouthguard. I worked my way through all of the sample in a few weeks. The only thing that would keep me from buying more is price. Each wipe is only good for one use. You could scrimp by only cleaning with this every few days and cleaning with a toothbrush in between, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended with caveat about the price.</li>
    <li> I wear my night guard religiously.  My dentist recommended soaking it in  water with a little mouthwash.  This does the trick as far as making it taste better, but it&#x27;s not an easy method to follow when travelling.  I will definitely take these with me on my next trip.  No mess, and they clean well and leave a nice, fresh taste.</li>
    <li> These are a life saver to keep partial plates and dentures or protectors fresh while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;I spent a week at the beach and had these along so I didn&#x27;t have to carry any heavier products.&lt;br /&gt;they worked and well and they are large enough to really clean a full set of dentures.&lt;br /&gt;I use mine for a mouth guard and the results were a fresh and clean apparatus every time.&lt;br /&gt;Hope they start making these in bulk as they are so simple to use just rip and go.</li>
    <li> I wear retainers and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for options to clean it after meals or when I don&#x27;t have quick access to clean water. The fresh guard was ok but because I have Invisaligns which do not have a smooth surface, it was hard to clean out all the nooks and crevices. I was leary about putting the braces back in my mouth without rinsing them out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I use this for storing the braces until I can get some clean water to rinse them out. I love the minty smell and the fact that the sheets themselves are quite big but still; need a rinse. These may work better for simpler mouth guards with smooth surfaces (maybe)</li>
    <li> I wear a mouthguard at night for TMJ, and keeping it clean was a real hassle until I came across these wipes.  They allow you to gently &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; the mouthguard and leave a very pleasant toothpasty smell/taste.  I&#x27;ll get them again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a retainer, but I do have a nightguard and I figured that since it&#x27;s made out of the same stuff you&#x27;d see for some of the mouthguards and the like out there, why not give it a try? I&#x27;m always a little leery of brushing since I don&#x27;t want to ruin my brushes or potentially harm my nightguard. Soaking it in some mouthwash is helpful, but then that isn&#x27;t the same as a thorough clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste of this is fairly nice. I like that it&#x27;s not extremely overwhelming. You can wipe your guard down and it won&#x27;t be insanely strong. There will be a hint of flavor, but overall it&#x27;s not going to be anything that will knock your socks off. This might be disappointing for some, but it&#x27;s still a better thing to taste than the alternative. If you have a guard of any type, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will get into most of the crevices and areas of the average guard. You&#x27;ll have to cram it into the more small areas, but it will fit everywhere. It seems to do a fairly good job of cleaning as well. I&#x27;d read that it could help get rid of stains and other discolorations, which is the biggest thing that appealed to me. So far I&#x27;ve done a few cloths and it seems to be helping a little. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but then I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be and to be honest, I&#x27;d be more than a little leery of something that would remove all the yellowing immediately. After all, what would it do to your mouth afterwards?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty good option and I&#x27;m curious to try the soaks to see what they would do as well.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s mouth guard was looking awful .They discolor easily and finally a product that is easy to use and gives him the confidence that he has cleaned the guard per the dentists recommendations.</li>
    <li> The Fresh guard wipes are great to throw in a pocket or keep on the sidelines because mouth guards get kind of disgusting. We used ours for a night guard for teeth grinding. The scent is nice and minty but there is virtually no taste. I even tried just licking the towelette and got the ever so slightest hint of mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would get a little pricey for daily use, as in a retainer or night grinding guard, but it would be great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipe is a nice large size that easily cleans out a guard or retainer, then toss. No muss and very little fuss. Convenient, easy to use, and no bad taste or aftertaste.</li>
    <li> Sports mouthguards, orthodontic retainers, and clear/removable braces can get unsanitary, odorous, stained, and have disgusting gunk buildup over time.  This is where Efferdent&#x27;s Fresh Guard wipes comes in handy.  When on the go, there are no faucets to rinse out mouthguards, etc..  Just tear open a pack of these wipes and clean it up.  These work great in getting rid of saliva/bacteria odors, stains, debris, and calcium buildup.  When at home, I can use the Fresh Guard soaks for a more thorough cleansing.  Slight drawback: only 20 individual mouthguard wipes per box.</li>
    <li> These work well with retainers. First I put the retainer under the water and then used these wipes and they did a really good job cleaning it. It&#x27;s definitely a better option then brushing your retainer and possibly breaking it. Very easy to use and I found them very convenient. They are great to travel with.</li>
    <li> I was traveling through SE Asia where the water was not safe to consume.  I didn&#x27;t want to wash my mouth guard in the water for this reason.  These wipes were a lifesaver!  I will use them again when traveling in countries where I cannot use water.  My mouth guard always felt clean when I wore it at night, even cleaner than washing it with soap and water.  I think I am going to buy more for home!I Great value!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work quite as well as hoped at getting the white gunk off, but still nice to know her retainers are clean in between good cleanings.</li>
    <li> Work good and easy to use</li>
    <li> Great Product .... Easy to carry and keeps my daughters retainers clean on the go.</li>
    <li> Mistakingly thought this was a soaking solution. Instead it turned out to be moistened toilets. They smell and taste sweat but I didn&#x27;t find them very effective in removing any plaque or truel providing any cleansing at all.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel when the water is dubious and you don&#x27;t want to use the powder. I use it for my mouthguard.</li>
    <li> My son wears a bite guard to bed every night to stop him from grinding his teeth.  He uses Fresh Guard every night to clean his upper and lower bight guard.  This is super easy to use.  It comes in prepackaged squares which are easy to open.  The cloth cleans very well and is so convenient.  I found these cloths to be sanitary and they do not leave any kind of bad taste.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love these cloths.  they do the trick.  They seem similar to hang sanitizer wipes.  I always worry about my night guard.  Now I don&#x27;t have to.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I think this would be a great product to take if you are traveling, but it would be too expensive to use on a daily basis. You can soak your retainers or mouth guards in Hydrogen Perozide over night, and it would be just as effective in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really speak for how well they actually clean but my night guard tastes much better after cleaning it with one of these. It&#x27;s also a really great / easier/ less messy alternative to using the drops that dissolve in water, especially when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> Terrific product - I use this for my nightguard which I have to use every night. Great for taking on the road when staying at hotels. Definitely does the trick for freshening up an item that is frequently easy to neglect. But we also used these for my wife&#x27;s Invisalign braces. That&#x27;s where they really came in handy, as she was able to really refresh her braces when out and about, after lunch hour at work, after eating at a restaurant, or anywhere else you need something to wipe down a plastic mouthpiece. And while I continue to use for my nightguard, she&#x27;ll continue to use after transitioning over to nightly retainer. A great idea that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> We have two in our home that use retainers for maintenance of their lovely smile. They don&#x27;t always like or follow the routine of caring for their retainers as well as they should and the overnight soaks seem to be a total drag for them. Fresh Guard Wipes are a great way to keep those retainers and other mouth pieces fresher and better maintained than with a regular toothbrush. They are especially great when one plans to be away a few days. The wipes are easily transported and give a nice clean and minty feeling to the apparatus as well as a fresh clean feeling to one&#x27;s mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy them all the time and use them regularly? No, but I would keep some on hand for travel and tucked into a purse or pocket in case they are needed to clean something off when we are out.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1CB15KBOWBA0U]]I recently got a custom made mouth guard for my upper teeth to help prevent any more damage due to my gnashing my teeth together. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about 14 hours a day, removing it when I ate and while I slept. It&#x27;s working even better than I hoped, and my only concern was the bacteria that was probably building up on it. I tried soaking it in mouthwash overnight, but I&#x27;m not sure how effective that was, so I decided to try the Fresh Guard wipes. I&#x27;m pleased with them so far. They&#x27;re soft enough to get down into the nooks and crannies of the mouth guard, and it only takes a minute or two to clean the mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the long run, I&#x27;ll probably go with a liquid soak overnight, maybe the Fresh Guard Soak product, but for now I&#x27;m happy to use the wipes to disinfect my mouth guard and get rid of all the nasty stuff that builds up on it.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product! I ordered the Fresh Guard Wipes for my husband as he wears a retainer. He said this is a great product as it cleans his retainer but also leaves a clean, fresh taste.</li>
    <li> Wipes, great idea to quickly freshen the retainers in between the major cleanings!</li>
    <li> These wipes are a must have if you have invisilign braces.</li>
    <li> Something. Didn&#x27;t know they had a product for mouth guards. Works fresher then what I was using</li>
    <li> Horrible taste!! Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores anymore and for someone with a mouthguard, they&#x27;re the best!</li>
