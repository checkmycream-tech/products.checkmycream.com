    <li> Luxurious eye cream...works great!</li>
    <li> not sure of the results yet but it feels good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using No 7 day and night cream for years.  I decided to try this eye cream and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It&#x27;s light and feels great on your skin.</li>
    <li> It is OK, but I won&#x27;t but it again. Too expensive and so far, no results.</li>

    <li> For a 72 yoa woman this is a great item.  It is helping to decrease the wrinkles a little bit, but more than any other product I have used.  I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> So far I love it.  Not long enuf to tell if there will be results.  I use the entire 7 line.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good eye cream that would help with my Crow&#x27;s feet.  This cream makes them look worse.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and this does not help with wrinkles.  The only thing it helps with is under eye circles and puffiness.  I would not waste my money on this cream.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  It has helped with lines under my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is new to me so I&#x27;m hoping it will do what it says it will do.  I love all No7 products and wish I could find them without having to order them on line.</li>
    <li> One of the claims of this Eye Cream is that it reduces &amp;#34;puffiness,&amp;#34; in fact, that was the reason I bought it.  It does NOT reduce puffiness not does it do anything that another eye cream does...it makes you feel you&#x27;re doing something good for your face, when, in fact, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> So an ad on it somewhere.  So I tried it and it works just as the testimonials.  Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed with it . Seen no difference. Used this for a month or a little longer . Was very disapointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month an it&#x27;s not helping my puffiness..I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s only because I&#x27;ve been using for a short period of time? I&#x27;m using it twice a day once at night..</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself, for my birthday, I saw it on &amp;#34;The Doctors&amp;#34; program, it really works great! I love it!</li>
    <li> It is okay. Not the best I have used. Would not order again unless it went on extreme sale. Meh</li>
    <li> i LOVE this eye cream. i have gotten so many complements since i have been using this. everyone has been asking why i look so good lately. this stuff is my little secrete. it has made my eyes look brighter and younger. i have noticed the small wrinkles just disappear. and my skin feels so soft and amazing. im only 26 and i cant wait to see how amazing my skin will look as i get older. a customer for life. i also have very sensitive skin and this does not bother my skin what so ever. honestly you need to buy this and try it for yourself. it is just amazing!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive products but have found that Boots No 7 really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;The results are remarkable, find lines have faded and more defined lines around my eyes&lt;br /&gt;have been reduced.  I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product.  The price is also a great value.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any difference yet but I&#x27;m not that steady using it</li>
    <li> Still waiting to see a difference. It has not worked for me.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and all of the Boots no 7 products.  This is all I use and I see the big difference in my eyes and entire face.  I am 62 yrs. young and nobody can guess my age.  I recently had a man in his 50&#x27;s that I have known for many years told me he thought I was younger than him.  Don&#x27;t hesitate this product is amazing.  Don&#x27;t give up using it because you haven&#x27;t seen results in a few short weeks (but you will).  This works better when you continue using it.  I too have tried the more expensive items as well as all of Avon products.  THIS IS THE BEST !!!!!  I have a graveyard of products that I no longer use.</li>
    <li> I am 73 and find this product helpful in making my eyes more prominent.  The product is easily applied and blends with my shiin shade.  I image it would perform even better when used by younger people whose lines are just beginning to form.</li>
    <li> good eye cream for sensitive eyes</li>
    <li> Feels light and has helped me with the bags under my eyes.  I recommed it to every one that has any doubt.</li>
    <li> After several weeks saw no difference except skin is soft</li>
    <li> This works as well as more expensive eye creams</li>
    <li> this is truly amazing. it took about a month to see results,but wow it makes such a difference. i would and have told friends to buy it</li>
    <li> VERY DISAPPOINTING.  OVERPRICED.  DISAPPOINTING FOR A BOOTS PRODUCT.  STICK TO THE OLD TRIED AND TRUE.  PACKAGE RIPPED AND TUBE CRUSHED.  WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY</li>
    <li> Just been using this product for three weeks, but so far I like what I see. Love  this product. Real test will come after 3 months of ussage.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple of years; it is simply the best product out there at any price!</li>
    <li> I am 48yo I&#x27;ve been using face products since my early twenties so I have tried many brands. I have used Murad for more than 3 years and their eye cream though excellent cost $80, which is why I&#x27;m seeking a less costly alternative. I did a lot of research and boots no 7 was one of the top 5. I have been using the boots eye cream for approximately 2 weeks and so far I am sold, I noticed my bags are lighter and are less defined, I also put a little on my smile lines and am noticing that they too are less defined. I am happy so far and looking forward to the results after 6 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 months, have not notice much of change with the wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Already see  a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve definitely seen an improvement in my crows feet since I started using this 2 weeks ago.  I have very sensitive eyes and skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues</li>
    <li> Dark circles and fine lines gone after two weeks! Amazing!!!  They have a eye lift cream that I am going to try next! These are my favorite products now, I cleaned out my drawers of any other products be cause this little tube of miracle does what it says it does!</li>
    <li> Love the other products, not impressed with eye cream</li>
