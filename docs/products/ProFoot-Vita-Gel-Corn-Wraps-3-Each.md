      <li>These are a good product</li>
      <li>good product and good price</li>
      <li>But these are a good product and work like they say.</li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t cure the problem but are good for relief</li>
      <li>perfect product, exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I did!</li>
      <li>This product has been amazing at reducing scars on fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is simply amazing how these have helped her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Each can be used effectively for weeks.</li>
      <li>The gel makes them very comfortable so they are good to wear with even a close fitting shoe.</li>
      <li>Softens the corn .. And easily washable and reusable!</li>
      <li>These are much cheaper and just as good!</li>
      <li>Great product and very convenient to use!</li>
      <li>Very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Again, I love these for shoes that bite and pinch my toes.</li>
      <li>I bought many of these.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased.</li>
      <li>going to order more.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s asked me to get a lot more.</li>
      <li>Works but needs to be a longer toe sleeve to be better protection.</li>
      <li>I gave it a try two more times and my callous on that toe</li>
      <li>Made my sore toe feel better though.</li>
      <li>They also can be reused many times.</li>
      <li>However a pack of 10 would be probably more efficient</li>
      <li>I myself wasn&#x27;t entirely sure what the difference was between those two terms, since \\&quot;corn\\&quot; is a layman&#x27;s term, so I looked up both words.</li>
      <li>Love theses and work like a charm.</li>
      <li>It probably works best on the bigger toes.</li>
      <li>together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find in drug stores and if do, costs more.  </li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly and met every expectation I had for the product.</li>
      <li>These Corn Wraps work fine.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to put on, comfortable to wear, washable and reusable.</li>
      <li>They fit my toes fine.</li>
      <li>Relieves the pressure between the toe and works great not only for corns but cushions the toe that has a blister.</li>
      <li>They have relieved the pain on my toes from a corn and they fit snuggly and are comfortable.  </li>
      <li>use them all the time , they hold up well and keep me toes comfortable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that there is additional recommended treatment to prevent and repair calluses and corns on the feet besides these wraps, which includes the following:&lt;br</li>
      <li>WHY THERE CHEAP</li>
      <li>price was better than I could buy this product locally and the brand was good.  </li>
      <li>These are marvelous little wraps for any toe problem!</li>
      <li>The ProFoot Vita-Gel Corn Wraps work outstandingly for me because I seem to have a bone spur under my first toe and ouch</li>
      <li>It has caused significant foot pain &amp; significant fatigue on my body.</li>
      <li>They are very durable and can be reused many times.  </li>
      <li>Good quality seems like they will last along time.</li>
      <li>After all, they aren&#x27;t custom products, but once in a while we get lucky</li>
      <li>I bought one at CVS for $7 so getting three for half that price is a great deal.</li>
      <li>will expand to fit even large toe .  </li>
      <li>They are much quicker to apply than tape and do the job better than many other approaches, they fit nicely, clean up with hand soap.</li>
      <li>Their main advantage is that they don&#x27;t easily fall off, as toe caps tend to do.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Thus, this is called a \\&quot;corn wrap,\\&quot; because consumers are looking for relief from the pain that corns often cause, which calluses rarely</li>
      <li>also right on time.</li>
      <li>Im trying to correct the skin on my right pinky toe</li>
      <li>but I still find this concept amazing, simple, and cushiony (without being thick and annoying)--so that when I walk the pain is greatly minimized or unnoticeable.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>I have been reusing the same couple of wraps for many months.</li>
      <li>they were exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Shipping took long however I love the comfort and support on my toes with these</li>
      <li>And after a week and a half of constant use except in the shower they are still in great condition.</li>
      <li>The scars are very raised, discolored, and large.</li>
      <li>These really work to keep your toe from rubbing against the shoe.</li>
      <li>Very helpful to corns.</li>
      <li>Maybe, but for now these gel wraps work very well.  </li>
      <li>The only ones available do not have the gel cushion all the way around.</li>
      <li>Cost was very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>The gel is very comfy and it moisturizes while you wear them too.</li>
      <li>This is more easily accomplished by purchasing shoes later in the day to allow for natural swelling of the feet as the day progresses.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
      <li>I mainly needed it for my pinky toe</li>
      <li>I am not usually allergic to anything, but this is a product that I will never use again; neither would I recommend it to anyone!</li>
      <li>I thought these would be too big for my little toes which really need it, but it&#x27;s pretty snug fitting..</li>
      <li>For some reason I can feel it more tight on my left foot toe than my right ..</li>
      <li>I suppose that everyone&#x27;s foot is different, but I know that as long as I use these lovely thingys</li>
      <li>Finding the right &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; product to alleviate pain in a toe or finger is a personal journey.  </li>
      <li>I wash them after every use in mild soap and water, rinse them, pat them dry on a clean washcloth, and allow them to air dry</li>
      <li>I LOVE THESE LITTLE THINGS!</li>
      <li>I do a great deal of standing and walking, and even with well-fitting socks, whose seams don&#x27;t press against my toes, and athletic shoes which are adequately wide, my little toes take a beating from inevitable friction against them.</li>
      <li>and it hardly stretched enough to fit around it.</li>
      <li>I use these for my big toe for sandals and open toe high heel shoes that rub or pinch my toe right by my toe nail.</li>
      <li>Most of the ones you find in drug stores only have the gel on half of the  wrap.</li>
      <li>They fit so tight around my toes.</li>
      <li>Make sure your shoes are wide enough to accommodate the toes without shoving them on top of each other and causing them to rub against each other.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These work great.  They have relieved the pain on my toes from a corn and they fit snuggly and are comfortable.  They stay in place.  I like the fact that these have the gel entirely around the wrap.</li>
    <li> Great product and very convenient to use!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a long time.  They have saved me a lot of pain.  I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems that Sangeet complains of.  I suppose that everyone&#x27;s foot is different, but I know that as long as I use these lovely thingys I do not get a corn between my toes.  There is no adhesive to make your toe sticky and they have the advantage of being reusable for a long time with a little care.  I just rinse them out and let them dry overnight.  I have been reusing the same couple of wraps for many months.</li>
    <li> they were exactly as described. Works well for what I needed.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing these for a little over a week now. I have noticed a lot of improvement in my corns, however I have long toes so these slide out of position throughout the day. I&#x27;m going to get the long tube that you customise to your desired length. But these are a good product and work like they say. And after a week and a half of constant use except in the shower they are still in great condition.</li>
    <li> Just a little tight on the fingers and I&#x27;m a small person, but they stretch after the first wearing.  The interior lining goes all the way around.  Best price I could find.</li>
    <li> good product and good price</li>
    <li> It shows that you can use these on the big toe but I had a hard time getting them on the smaller toe next to it. They didn&#x27;t work for me but maybe would for someone else</li>
    <li> These are a great value for the money. They work really well to alleviate the pain from a corn I have between my fourth and fifth toe. I bought one at CVS for $7 so getting three for half that price is a great deal.</li>
    <li> There not cheap, but there worth the money for the releif they bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark D. Avery&lt;br /&gt;Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Cancer Victim</li>
    <li> These toe sleeves are a Godsend! I do lots of walking (I use public transportation &amp; have to walk to/from my bus stop and the rail station) and the friction has caused growths on my baby toes and big toes. I used to invest in the dr scholls brand but they are pricey! These are much cheaper and just as good! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Greatly relieved pain in my toe.</li>
    <li> Far too expensive for the value. Did not stay in place and were too short to cover the necessary area. I would not recommend this product after using it for two weeks. The gel wraps do wash well and retain their shape but do not serve the purpose for which I purchased them.</li>
    <li> IF YOUR CORN BOTHERS YOU THESE WONT WORK THE GEL IS PAPER THIN THATS WHY THERE CHEAP THE ONES BY PEDIFIX ARE JUST OVER $7 BUT THE GEL IS 4X THICKER ON ONE SIDE WHERE YOU NEED IT JUST TAPE THEM IN PLACE SO THEY DONT ROTATE WHEN YOU WALK......THESE DONT WORK</li>
    <li> These are everything as described.&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses and we was and use again&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase in the future when needed</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what I expected and wanted. It arrived very quickly and met every expectation I had for the product.</li>
    <li> They fit my toes fine. These woke me up in the middle of the night cause it gave me pain and burning sensation on my toe. Not sure why.</li>
    <li> Love theses and work like a charm.</li>
    <li> These really work to keep your toe from rubbing against the shoe. Only problem is that sometimes they want to slip off the small toe.</li>
    <li> I have 2 toes with arthritis and my shoes hurt them, I put these on and I can now do my daily walking without pain, I have been using the same 2 for days and they are holding up really well.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Works for the short time until they wear out, which ends up being quite expensive to replace</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these and didn&#x27;t like this product, they are so small that they do not even cover your pinky finger and they come out of your finger as you walk or possibly run.  Would not recommend to buy this product.  Thank</li>
    <li> I do a great deal of standing and walking, and even with well-fitting socks, whose seams don&#x27;t press against my toes, and athletic shoes which are adequately wide, my little toes take a beating from inevitable friction against them. I&#x27;ve tested multiple methods of protecting my little toes, and these wraps work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Their main advantage is that they don&#x27;t easily fall off, as toe caps tend to do. They also can be reused many times. I wash them after every use in mild soap and water, rinse them, pat them dry on a clean washcloth, and allow them to air dry overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this \\&quot;corn wrap\\&quot; works to prevent both calluses and corns. I myself wasn&#x27;t entirely sure what the difference was between those two terms, since \\&quot;corn\\&quot; is a layman&#x27;s term, so I looked up both words. They are not exactly the same thing. They are similar in that both are caused by the buildup of hard, dense skin as a result of pressure or friction on a particular area of skin, usually on the feet or hands. They are different in that corns tend to be smaller than calluses and have a hard center, and they are more likely than calluses to be painful when pressed. Thus, this is called a \\&quot;corn wrap,\\&quot; because consumers are looking for relief from the pain that corns often cause, which calluses rarely do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that there is additional recommended treatment to prevent and repair calluses and corns on the feet besides these wraps, which includes the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash and dry the feet well at least once per day.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use a dense, moisturizing cream on the feet at least once a day, either a product especially made for feet, or a product such as [[ASIN:B00113HNB4 Cetaphil cream]].&lt;br /&gt;3. Wear socks without thick seams in the toe area which can put pressure on the toes.&lt;br /&gt;4. Make sure your shoes are wide enough to accommodate the toes without shoving them on top of each other and causing them to rub against each other. This is more easily accomplished by purchasing shoes later in the day to allow for natural swelling of the feet as the day progresses.&lt;br /&gt;5. Use a pumice stone or foot file regularly, rubbing gently so as to not break the skin.&lt;br /&gt;6. Wear socks rather than putting bare feet inside your shoes, change your socks every day, and don&#x27;t walk around in socks wet from sweat or other sources of moisture such as rain.is is more easily accomplished by purchasing shoes later in the day to allow for natural swelling of the feet as the day progresses.&lt;br /&gt;5.

    <li> These are impossible to find in retail pharmacies anymore. The only ones available do not have the gel cushion all the way around.</li>
    <li> will expand to fit even large toe .  but is so small that it slid down from center of toe and  cut circulation of blood to toe</li>
    <li> I use simular products all the time. All the local stores have starting caring a much cheaper version that only has gel on one side not all the way around. This product does us gel all around but it is very short so it doesn&#x27;t cover my toe.</li>
    <li> I thought these would be too big for my little toes which really need it, but it&#x27;s pretty snug fitting.. For some reason I can feel it more tight on my left foot toe than my right .. But it gets the job done.. Softens the corn .. And easily washable and reusable!</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t cure the problem but are good for relief</li>
    <li> Finding the right &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; product to alleviate pain in a toe or finger is a personal journey.  After all, they aren&#x27;t custom products, but once in a while we get lucky and then we feel grateful.  The ProFoot Vita-Gel Corn Wraps work outstandingly for me because I seem to have a bone spur under my first toe and ouch--that is painful when I walk.  Will surgery be in my future?  Maybe, but for now these gel wraps work very well.  You just slip one over the toe to cover/protect the painful area, and the gel in the wrap feels good.  Occasionally one will try to slip off but I still find this concept amazing, simple, and cushiony (without being thick and annoying)--so that when I walk the pain is greatly minimized or unnoticeable.  Any product that enables me to keep my mobility in a pain-free way is my friend.  I bought many of these.  They are very durable and can be reused many times.  Also, they are so portable that you can put a few in your purse or pocket while you are out--just in case you need one. Some of you might have a corn or other issue that would heal if you just stayed off your feet--but that&#x27;s almost impossible to do, so with this  wrap snuggled around your toe, the healing process can hopefully happen. So it helps temporary or permanent problems.</li>
    <li> perfect product, exactly what I was expecting.  also right on time.</li>
    <li> Works but needs to be a longer toe sleeve to be better protection. Wish these we&#x27;re twice as long as barely covers spot.</li>
    <li> These are marvelous little wraps for any toe problem!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I ordered these for my little toes. I think these are great and you can wash them after use.</li>
    <li> Great product. Most of the ones you find in drug stores only have the gel on half of the  wrap. These have the gel on the entire inside.</li>
    <li> Great fills good perfect</li>
    <li> Very helpful to corns. No problems with this</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GCIB6W ProFoot Vita-Gel Corn Wraps, 3 ct.]] I like these. They are much quicker to apply than tape and do the job better than many other approaches, they fit nicely, clean up with hand soap. However a pack of 10 would be probably more efficient</li>
    <li> These little gems really work.</li>
    <li> use them all the time , they hold up well and keep me toes comfortable.</li>
    <li> Cannot comment on the product quality and effectiveness. The corn is on my big(great) toe. It will not fit way too tight.</li>
    <li> This product has been amazing at reducing scars on fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has very terrible scars on her fingers from an accident a year ago. The scars are very raised, discolored, and large. After about a month of wearing this the scars are remarkably reduced. Their height is down by over 50% and the color of them is starting to match her normal skin. It is simply amazing how these have helped her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping silicon pressed against scars causes them to reduce. Several times a day, press on the scar and massage in circular motion in conjunction with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went to one of the best plastic surgeons in Seattle and he recommended this. It works incredibly.</li>
    <li> My husband has had a problem with friction between a couple of his toes for years. These little wraps have solved his problem, simply and completely.</li>
    <li> PRO FOOT VITA-GEL CORN WRAPS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was better than I could buy this product locally and the brand was good.  I was pleased.</li>
    <li> These were nothing like I expected. They fit so tight around my toes. I mainly needed it for my pinky toe and it hardly stretched enough to fit around it. I wanted to wear it in my shoes to prevent rubbing but it was too thick. I wore it overnight and my toe was cold and blue. The gel lining is too bulky and in my opinion does nothing. I gave it a try two more times and my callous on that toe seemed just as hard as before. Maybe this wasn&#x27;t the product for me but it.definitely did not work.</li>
    <li> The 360 degree cushioning is a good idea in theory, but to accomplish that, the layer of cushioning is very, very thin.  It also did not stay in place on my toe very well - after a few minutes of walking it would slide out of position.  That problem probably varies from person to person and toe to toe, but it was a problem for me.</li>
    <li> The wrap would stay on my small toe. It probably works best on the bigger toes.</li>
    <li> It does not work. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> These are a good product but I dont recommend that you cut them. They tend to roll up if you do. The gel makes them very comfortable so they are good to wear with even a close fitting shoe.</li>
    <li> They tend to slip off and curl up on your toes ...  I would not buy them again.  Looking for something to separate my toes (to help with hammer toes) and this did not do it.</li>
    <li> They work and are not too thick.  Price is great and they won&#x27;t fall off your foot. Best ones I have tried.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something longer and these were not working for me.  I know theystretch, but they still did not fit my toe to help.</li>
    <li> Hubby needs this for a toe that is sore from wearing his boots so long on his 12 hour shifts. Not sure if it is a corn or not, but he said these are AMAZING! Saved us a doctor&#x27;s visit. He&#x27;s asked me to get a lot more.</li>
    <li> Too small for big toe. Felt like it was cutting off circulation</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stay on your toes very well and basically, you only get one use out of each one. Made my sore toe feel better though.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable.  Good quality seems like they will last along time. They hold up to getting wet very well. Cost was very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> My mom and auntie are thanking me each day for finding and buying this simple-genius product! Each can be used effectively for weeks.</li>
    <li> Shipping took long however I love the comfort and support on my toes with these</li>
    <li> helped to reduce foot pain from my toes rubbing together.  going to order more.</li>
    <li> I wore this for an injured finger!  they are for toes but worked wonderful for an injured finger.  I could not keep the wrap on my finger but these worked great.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed to separate my big toe from the one next to it.  Works great and I can play sports and not have&lt;br /&gt;them rub together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find in drug stores and if do, costs more.  I great &#x27;add on&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Relieves the pressure between the toe and works great not only for corns but cushions the toe that has a blister.</li>
    <li> I use these for my big toe for sandals and open toe high heel shoes that rub or pinch my toe right by my toe nail. These things are a life saver for that!! They can be used several times and you can wash them out by hand to re use them. They do not take up extra space in the shoes so they do not make the shoes tight. You can not tell I am wearing it either which is great!! I can also cut them to size for if I am wearing a sandal with a narrow strap over my toes. Again, I love these for shoes that bite and pinch my toes. They are not just for cornes!! This is also a great price for these! The gel is very comfy and it moisturizes while you wear them too. A must have for shoes that bite!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE LITTLE THINGS! Im trying to correct the skin on my right pinky toe and this is helping. I just use it when I wear close toe shoes. Yesterday I wore heels and didnt feel pain AT ALL.</li>
    <li> I hike for a living &amp; I&#x27;ve had the same damn corn on my pinky toe for years. It has caused significant foot pain &amp; significant fatigue on my body. I ordered these on a whim after a particularly bad day. I am so glad I did! The corn is getting smaller and I have NO foot pain anymore! And to boot, they last forever!</li>
    <li> This appeared to be a product that would meet my needs.  In reality, it was a great disappointment.  After wearing one of these for a day, it gave my toe, and surrounding foot area, intense itchy, scratchy symptoms similar to athletes foot.  I am not usually allergic to anything, but this is a product that I will never use again; neither would I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Best purchase I have made in a while. Keeps my toes for getting corns. i would recommend these to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> These Corn Wraps work fine. I have a corn beween two toe nails that I have been unable to erradicate. These wraps alleviate pain, and stay on firmly on toe when you take off your shoes. Other similar products slip out. I plan to keep púrchasing this product.</li>
    <li> These corn wraps will make walking a pleasure again. They&#x27;re easy to put on, comfortable to wear, washable and reusable. They don&#x27;t last forever, but they last long enough for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> I bought it because my little toe used to always rub against all of my new shoes they feel funny and role down when used</li>
