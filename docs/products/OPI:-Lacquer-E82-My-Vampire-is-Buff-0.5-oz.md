      <li>I love this color and OPI never disappoints!</li>
      <li>Great formula and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Like a lot of OPI colors, it goes on nice with about two coats.</li>
      <li>I always buy this product and I love this color</li>
      <li>so this is my go to, favorite color.</li>
      <li>I thought I would love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll b</li>
      <li>It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
      <li>I usually love their polish and don&#x27;t have a huge issue with formula.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen people rave about how great this nail color is, and the awesome reviews combined by my silly infatuation with the name led me to spring for it without trying it out.</li>
      <li>Overall great summer color.</li>
      <li>it is too light  </li>
      <li>Opaque for a light shade.  </li>
      <li>I think this would be really pretty underneath gitter top coats that have sheer bases, but it&#x27;s nice on its own as well.</li>
      <li>Color is great (true off white)</li>
      <li>This is yet another netural nude color that you can wear for special occassions like weddings.</li>
      <li>so they can use their Super Duper Polish Remover b/c</li>
      <li>The product cam quickly and was just as described</li>
      <li>I rarely switch up on the color winter, spring summer or fall</li>
      <li>Looks great with black polish!  </li>
      <li>I deducted one star because OPI gets so much praise as a nail-polish brand, and I guess I had high expectation that it wouldnt crack easily.</li>
      <li>Not an overwhelming white but still has a cloudy look.</li>
      <li>Very chic!</li>
      <li>Really like this Euro Centrale Collection!</li>
      <li>And while I can agree that this is an excellent and true neutral shade, it&#x27;s oddly streaky even after a few coats.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very particular about my nails appearance.</li>
      <li>I really like this polish.  </li>
      <li>I should really go to the nail salon</li>
      <li>Very versatile.</li>
      <li>It is very similar to a light skin tone.  </li>
      <li>This is such a nice color; creamy but not too yellow and not too shockingly white.</li>
      <li>A new staple in my &amp;#34;nail art&amp;#34; toolbox.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am working it out over here, I just keep painting a new coat every 3 days...</li>
      <li>Classy color!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a professional</li>
      <li>I have heard, however, that OPI base coat is great!</li>
      <li>I received a very old polish, meaning it was very clumpy, wouldn&#x27;t dry.  </li>
      <li>I wish I would have saved my money and purchased Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay Longwear Nail Enamel in Bare Bones instead.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it a lot so far with various takes on french manicures.</li>
      <li>I was surprised because usually I have a positive experience</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and goopy - goes on streaky and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry very quickly at all.</li>

<li> Classy color!</li>

<li> I was surprised because usually I have a positive experience</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick and goopy - goes on streaky and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry very quickly at all.</li>
<li> Its counterpart is Sephora By OPI&#x27;s Pale is The New Tan, which is pink-based.</li>
<li> I feel like this is a color I have been trying to find for awhile, but everything I thought would be close turned out to be too yellow or too pink for what I was after.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a problem with this shade in particular, or if it was just the bottle I got, but I have a very hard time getting a solid opaque color with no streaks or sheer patches.</li>
<li> The color is opaque, it doesn&#x27;t streak on application, and it dries in a decent amount of time (depending on how thick each coat is).</li>
<li> It looks a little like lite yellow with 3 coats.</li>
<li> Is a great base for nail art and to use as an accent color!  </li>
<li> Great as a base color for nail designs or a stand alone!</li>
<li> so I have a few nude colors.</li>
<li> i was looking for a few weeks for this shade at my beauty supply....</li>
<li> Not sure I would buy again, but it looks cure with my kb shimmer pastel glitter.</li>
<li> This is an opaque, yellow-based sand/beige color that needs at least two coats because it goes on a bit streaky.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick yet you have to apply 2 to 3 coats because of the streaks and unevenness.</li>
<li> It seems like all the shades of white that I have of OPI have the worst formula.</li>
<li> This nail polish has a weird consistency.</li>
<li> Mine came with a defective brush which made the application that much difficult.</li>
<li> I will never wear this as a base color.</li>
<li> I suppose no matter what you always need a base coat.</li>
<li> but when I applied it, I hated it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorta boring when nail polish</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i was looking for a few weeks for this shade at my beauty supply....finally i decided to buy it on line..great color to wear with anything</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorta boring when nail polish so this is my go to, favorite color. I rarely switch up on the color winter, spring summer or fall so I have a few nude colors.</li>
    <li> I like the color, but it begins to crack after it is on for awhile. Overall great summer color. Must change often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into white-sh nail colors with these. This one is creme grayish white and is opaque.</li>
    <li> Color is great (true off white) but application is a bit tricky as it is often the case with opaque milky colors. Mine came with a defective brush which made the application that much difficult.</li>
    <li> I like it! Not an overwhelming white but still has a cloudy look. I deducted one star because OPI gets so much praise as a nail-polish brand, and I guess I had high expectation that it wouldnt crack easily. I suppose no matter what you always need a base coat. I have heard, however, that OPI base coat is great!</li>
    <li> I love this color and OPI never disappoints! Great as a base color for nail designs or a stand alone!</li>
    <li> I received a very old polish, meaning it was very clumpy, wouldn&#x27;t dry.  I was surprised because usually I have a positive experience</li>
    <li> Great nail polish. Opaque in two coats. Great formula and easy to apply. This formula is not streaky. Gorgeous color. Product came well packaged and was not tampered with.</li>
    <li> It seems like all the shades of white that I have of OPI have the worst formula. It&#x27;s thick and goopy - goes on streaky and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry very quickly at all. I usually love their polish and don&#x27;t have a huge issue with formula. Alpine Snow has behaved very similarly to Vampire, so it just leads me to believe it&#x27;s the white polishes.</li>
    <li> It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
    <li> This color makes me feel so chic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am working it out over here, I just keep painting a new coat every 3 days...I don&#x27;t want to ever take it off...&lt;br /&gt;Although I will probably have 17 coats of it on my nails by the time I take it off...I should really go to the nail salon so they can use their Super Duper Polish Remover b/c I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll b a doosie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this color, u won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> No complaints about the formula. The color is opaque, it doesn&#x27;t streak on application, and it dries in a decent amount of time (depending on how thick each coat is). But I&#x27;m not WOW-ed by the color. I wish I would have saved my money and purchased Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay Longwear Nail Enamel in Bare Bones instead.</li>
    <li> I feel like this is a color I have been trying to find for awhile, but everything I thought would be close turned out to be too yellow or too pink for what I was after. I needed three coats of polish rather than just two, as it was a tiny bit runny but not unmanageable. I think this would be really pretty underneath gitter top coats that have sheer bases, but it&#x27;s nice on its own as well. Very versatile.</li>
    <li> This is an opaque, yellow-based sand/beige color that needs at least two coats because it goes on a bit streaky. Its counterpart is Sephora By OPI&#x27;s Pale is The New Tan, which is pink-based. Really like this Euro Centrale Collection!</li>
    <li> Hmm... I don&#x27;t like this shade at all. I thought I would love it but when I applied it, I hated it. It&#x27;s thick yet you have to apply 2 to 3 coats because of the streaks and unevenness. Therefore, it looks clumpy! I&#x27;m a professional and I&#x27;m very particular about my nails appearance. I will never wear this as a base color. I&#x27;ll just use it for designs.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it on And I did try it and love it! Classy color!</li>
    <li> This is such a nice color; creamy but not too yellow and not too shockingly white. I&#x27;ve used it a lot so far with various takes on french manicures. A new staple in my &amp;#34;nail art&amp;#34; toolbox. Like a lot of OPI colors, it goes on nice with about two coats.</li>
    <li> I really like this polish.  It is very similar to a light skin tone.  Creamy formula.  Opaque for a light shade.  Is a great base for nail art and to use as an accent color!  Looks great with black polish!  Very chic!</li>
    <li> I always buy this product and I love this color great OPI makes a really great product......I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I do not see anywhere on the listing that it is for a gel polish. If I wanted a gel polish, I would have ordered a gel polish.</li>
    <li> it is too light  and I don&#x27;t like the white color.</li>
    <li> I love this color! I order a lot of OPI nailpolish online. The product cam quickly and was just as described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen people rave about how great this nail color is, and the awesome reviews combined by my silly infatuation with the name led me to spring for it without trying it out. And while I can agree that this is an excellent and true neutral shade, it&#x27;s oddly streaky even after a few coats. I don&#x27;t know if this is a problem with this shade in particular, or if it was just the bottle I got, but I have a very hard time getting a solid opaque color with no streaks or sheer patches. It&#x27;s a shame.</li>
    <li> This nail polish has a weird consistency. It alsmost starts to crackle. Not sure I would buy again, but it looks cure with my kb shimmer pastel glitter.</li>
    <li> love this color!! It looks a little like lite yellow with 3 coats. Absolutely cute!</li>
    <li> This is yet another netural nude color that you can wear for special occassions like weddings. It is a beautiful color</li>
