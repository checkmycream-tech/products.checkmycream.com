<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good, effective and easy to use</li>
    <li> Love using my toothbrush, I still have it and bought it years ago. will purchase another one for my fiance</li>
    <li> Healthy gums and polished teeth make brushing daily with this product a worthwhile endeavor.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This replaced a similar older Oral-B electric toothbrush that I had for fifteen years that also worked great.  The new one is considerably more powerful and if it lasts nearly as long, I&#x27;ll be quite happy with it!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this is my second and I love this product , last one lasted sevral years until it stopped taking a charge ... had to get another ... cleans excellently and  would not go back to regular brushing ever again ...</li>
    <li> More RPM than my old PowerBrush. Like the way it slows when I apply to much pressure. Product was shipped quickly and arrived before proposed date.</li>
    <li> I have used an Oral B for about fifteen years. This new model Oral B 1000 is terrific. Much more effective to use and my teeth and mouth feel so clean and fresh when I am done.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased thinking I was going to get a 50% cash back. But that seems to not have worked but I am still pleased to have this now.    Follow the 3o-second procedures and it works great.    Definitely worth it from normal brushing. My gums bled at first but have now stopped. Floss at least once a day still recommended.    Good luck with the Oral-B Toothbrush it won&#x27;t let you down.    Brushing takes a few days to get used to.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist.  He said there were other brushes that cost more with more bells and whistles, but this would have everything I need to get professionally clean results.  I have to agree that it is great, it cleans my teeth better than any other brush I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the price was so low, but I got this toothbrush for about $48.  With the Oral B Rebate of 50%, I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  The final price was $24.      This is my first powered toothbrush.  For the most part, it&#x27;s great, but there are a few things I would change having used someone else&#x27;s power toothbrush.   1.) There is no reservoir on the back of the stand to hold other toothbrushes.  2.) There is only one speed.  I would probably only use the high speed though, so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.  3.) The toothbrush warns you every 30 seconds to move on to the next part of your mouth.  (You&#x27;re supposed to spend 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth.)  It&#x27;s not such a bad thing, but I prefer just the final 2 minute warning, as I don&#x27;t need my toothbrush micro-managing my time.</li>
    <li> Compared to a regular tooth brush my teeth feel so much cleaner, and the vibration is enjoyable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is great, however it seems to take a while to fully charge. This is not a problem at all though because you don&#x27;t need it to be fully charged to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger base is easy to clean even if dried up tooth paste begins to build up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as replacement heads, I went with the [[ASIN:B004LZCY6S Generic Oral-B Dual Clean Compatible Replacement Brush Heads (4 ct.)]]. They work great and are cheaper than the Oral B brand replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this powered tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I had used Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for almost two years, and Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush is my replacement. So far, the new toothbrush is working great, smooth and more powerful than my old one.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B 1000 power toothbrush is an excellent product for its purpose.  I thoroughly enjoy using it and my teeth always feel and look good.  The one thing I noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as my older one; however, it is easy enough to recharge.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic model.</li>
    <li> I had an older model Oral-B tooth brush for almost 8 years and was very pleased with the performance. The battery finally died so I bouth a new one and this new one is even nicer then the older one.</li>
    <li> I got in on this brush once I saw the recent 50% back rebate from Oral B.   I already had an electric toothbrush I have been using for 3 years and enjoyed, so I didn&#x27;t expect much from this brush, other than to have it as a replacement for when my current toothbrush went dead.  I charged it up and tried it out, just to see if there was a different.  I was BLOWN AWAY!  It&#x27;s so good that my other brush has ended up under the sink as a backup.  And as many others have mentioned before me, I get that \\&quot;feels like I just came from the dentist\\&quot; feeling after every brush!  I LOVE this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I have used Oral-B electric toothbrush for 6 years. This Professional Care 1000 is the cheapest one, but it still powerful and high speed.  Only one fault is that the green LED is not clear on charging.</li>
    <li> As usual a reliable product from Oral-B, although it is not a top end product. The price is good too</li>
    <li> There has been a documented relationship between plaque on your teeth and heart attacks, which is why I decided to buy this toothbrush. This model was found to be more effective at reducing plaque than other electric or manual brushes by a study done in England. I use it twice a day for the full 2 minutes and follow it with floss - it feels like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office after a thorough cleaning. It seems expensive until you compare it to the cost of one dental cleaning and realize you&#x27;re getting the same feeling everyday. It&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I have an older model of this toothbrush and I am buying a new one. My system makes alot of plaque. I was going to the dentist every 3 months for a cleaning. I bought this brush and now go twice a year for cleaning. It has saved me alot of money! The older one will go in my suitcase. I will use it for traveling. I can charge the brush before I leave and it will be good to go when I get there.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast response/shipment of this product to me. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot, and I was looking for a replacement to an older model Braun 3D brush that I had for 5-6 years that finally petered out.   This was the ticket!</li>
    <li> The Oral-B 7400 Electric toothbrush holds a charge for several days, cleans my teeth very well (I expect the dentist to be pleased at my next cleaning) and the built-in timer ensures that I brush long enough.  If you like or would like to use an electric toothbrush, this one does a great job for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I was using a cheaper  model rotary style brush for the previous 2 years when it finally broke. They used a thin metal that reached all the way up into the brush. It rusted and snapped. I pulled it apart and found it was about as thick as a the metal in a small paperclip. Braun uses a much thicker metal stem system that does not go all the way up to the brush, but rather the brush is made to reach down to the stem. Much better build quality. Much easier to dry off if you want to and being at least 3 times thicker it will last for years compared to the other brush.&lt;br /&gt;When I researched the heck out of Electric brushes, I found the Braun 3D Excel was #1. Yes, it topped the famous sonicare. Sonicare does a better job advertising while I spent less $$ and have a better product doing what it should be doing. Cleaning my teeth. I do tell people about this product. Its something that actually lives up to its repuation. Its one of the great products in my opinion. After about a week of using mine, I ordered another and had it sent to my mom.&lt;br /&gt;When I first turned it on, I was impressed already. I could tell it was high quality. Then I began using everyday and have done so for over 1 month now. I love the timer and try to brush 2x a day as recommended. Its great and my teeth have improved. I can tell they are smoother and whiter and feel much better. I can feel that my gums and teeth have tightened a little better where I used to feel bigger gaps when flossing. I will never go back to using a stick brush and I can only imagine how impressive the next generation of electric toothbrushes will be. Awesome already and if they improve on this, it will be amazing.  If youre too cheap for Amazon, they can be found on ebay too. Its worth the money especially when it keeps the dentist away. I rate this product 5 huge STARS. Get it and you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;m writing this review, it seems silly that I&#x27;m so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush.  But I am.  I bought this item not long after I had my first (and hopefully only) root canal and crown four years ago, something which I never again want to experience in my life (as someone else described, it was painful and expensive).  Growing up, I didn&#x27;t take care of my teeth like I should&#x27;ve, so I&#x27;m accustomed to always being told there&#x27;s either a cavity, or the start of one, and having to have more work done.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the root canal, my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain number of pulsations/oscillations, because that&#x27;s what she&#x27;d been recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums.  This specific item met those requirements, and it was affordable.  When I first started using it, my gums were very sensitive to it, but that quickly wore off, so it seems to me that it strengthens the gums.  It is also MUCH easier to get behind the front teeth.  Subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have improved dramatically after using a high-quality electric toothbrush such as this one (I honestly don&#x27;t remember if she has this exact model, but ours are similar), and I&#x27;ve not needed any work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since I purchased it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As far as cleaning the unit to keep it from \\&quot;gunking\\&quot; up, I&#x27;m the only person who uses this item, so any extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in, not dripping into the storage container; so I don&#x27;t know how to combat that.  But I just take the toothbrush head off the thing and rinse it, then rinse the hand-held part, and set them back on the unplugged charger/base (I only plug it in when the battery runs low) and things stay clean with no problem.</li>
    <li> This is a nice easy to use toothbrush. Lots of power and holds a charge pretty good. Best way to use is to let the battery drain down before recharging. After maybe five days of use, twice a day, you can feel the battery will need to be recharged for maximum power. I like the fact that it only has a two-minute timer and will NOT turn off after two minutes. I don&#x27;t need a toothbrush with too many bells and whistles. Only annoying thing for some would be the blue recharge indicator light that stays on while charging. I use like a night light for those middle of the night bathroom excursions. No more being blinded by turning on the light!</li>
    <li> Love this electric toothbrush (my first electric, btw). It&#x27;s very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take up much shelf space in my smallish bathroom, does a great job. I love the timer aspect. I like it so much I bought 2 for my kids for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This is a superior electric toothbrush with loads of special features I haven&#x27;t had before. My dentist said I was brushing too hard so I bought this toothbrush. If I brush too hard it turns off to let me know to ease up.</li>
    <li> This high powered toothbrush helps you brush better.  However, it is not magic.  You still have to know \\&quot;how to brush.\\&quot;  It is also much more messy, using this kind of toothbrush, but the dental hygenists strongly recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral B--the first died after about five years.  This one does an excellent job, has a built in holder for brushes, and a built in timer for those of us who like to cut short our brushing.</li>
    <li> This is my second electric toothbrush.  I upgraded this time based on a recommendation and have to say it lives up to it&#x27;s description.  When fully charged - it will take you through an extra long vacation without re-charging. I like the smaller brush that allows you to get around bridge work and between teeth, and that it lets you know when you&#x27;ve done 2 minutes worth (started out determined to always do this --- think I&#x27;m down to a minute -- but teeth and gums look and feel good.) Only thing I&#x27;d like is a bigger head on the main brush, so that my minute was covering more teeth area.</li>
    <li> We had our previous Bran/Oral B toothbrush for over 15 years.  The one day it failed to recharge.  This Oral B is an excellent product.  It vibrates to remind you to move on to next quadrant, but brushing for a longer time takes some getting used to.  There is a charging/charger light which seems to be on most of the time.  The carrier holds four toothbrushes (two regular ones are supplied with the unit).  I would have expected that the wall attachemnt holes would line up with the previous model--they do not and require redrilling.  The price tag is a bit lofty--however the [....]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-sixties and this is the FIRST electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;ve always considered my brushing technique effective and never thought I needed to add another electrical appliance to my life.  Then a bit of gum recession and concerns expressed both by my dentist and a periodontist to whom I was referred made me re-think my oral hygiene.      I bought this toothbrush after some research and am delighted with it.  I brush two minutes twice a day and my teeth have never felt cleaner, except perhaps immediately after professional cleaning and polishing.  The toothbrush stands to one side of my sink, returning to the charging base only when the red light begins to flash.  The charging base is tucked away in the kitchen.  Occasionally I inadvertently press the button turning the toothbrush off but on reflection I don&#x27;t believe there is a better location for the button.  The toothbrush does lose a bit of energy over time as the battery wears down but it still does an excellent job of cleaning.  I get almost two weeks of brushing before it is necessary to recharge the unit.    Finally, although I haven&#x27;t bought replacement brushes as yet, one of the reasons I opted for the Oral-B toothbrush is the reasonable price of replacement brushes.  This is what I call good value for money.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush handle itself is as expected, but the base has no storage place for the brush heads as the model I had previously.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush! It is every bit as good as the Sonic Care, but at a much better price. It is also more compact, making it easier to store in the bathroom. It has a timer, so you know how long to brush in each quadrant. The brush heads come in different forms, so you can choose which is most comfortable for you.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a month now and I just love that clean feeling. I&#x27;ll be getting one each for my 2 teens.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Sonicare for about 10 years. The price of refill  brushes finally got me researching for a new toothbrush. After reading  the positive reviews about the Oral-B Professional, I decided to get one. The first time I used it, what a difference. I use the plak   remover head, and my teeth feel cleaner, especially at the gum line,  than they ever felt with the Sonicare. 2 minutes with this, you&#x27;ll  feel a new clean.</li>
    <li> I have used this for more than two years and very happy. Highly recomend this .  [[ASIN:B000050FDE Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> my teeth were brushed by these, but the super high vibrations, i could prolly think of another thing this could be used for.</li>
    <li> Package arrived quickly and in good shape.  This toothbrush is amazing. After using it my teeth felt just like l had stepped out of the dental hygenist&#x27;s chair.  I can see why they say it really cuts down on tartar build up.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a month and I absolutely love it. It cleans my teeth really well and massages my gums. It requires very little pressure from my hands (helps me deal with my RSI). Even the brush heads pricing is fairly reasonable. you can buy the standard brush heads on Amazon for about $5 each (cheaper than Phillips sonicare brush heads). That sounds like a lot but I realized that with each brush head lasting three months (Oral-B recommendation), it can actually save me money over my typical going through one manual toothbrush a month. I think the brush heads last longer because much less pressure is applied in typical usage.    (vs other models)  It&#x27;s got all the basic features you want (brushing action, high-frequency pulse, pressure sensor, 4x30 sec timer, inductive charging) and none of them bells and whistles of questionable usefulness (such as different brushing modes, \\&quot;Smart\\&quot; brushing guide, and travel charger). I think it&#x27;s a best buy among the electric toothbrushes on the market today.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun toothbrush ~ 10+ years old.  A similar model a 3D Professional.  Worked great - water started to leak past the seals and became intermittent.  Pretty good life - considering used heavily.    New one is better in almost all respects.  Much less vibration, while cleaning better.  battery gauge.      Would rather have a white handle with less mouldings (easier to keep clean).    Overall, pretty happy and seems like a step up.    P&amp;G brands this as Oral-B which are the heads - but the reason I bought this was Braun quality for bottom part and Made in Germany - not Mexico or China.</li>
    <li> After using one for 7 years or so the old professional gave out finally.  The NEW one I had to buy at Target (sorry Amazon when your toothbrush is broke asap is more important then price).  I did the full charge last night and let it run down without a brush on and I am charging it back up to full.  Just got done using it again before bed.  This electric toothbrush is better then their last model and more powerful.  I can tell by how clean my teeth are.  Thanks a bunch Oral B for the High Quality Product.</li>
    <li> I bought the Oral B Professional Care 1000 Power tooth brush after several unsuccessful attempts to get cheaper alternatives. I have to tell you that it works great. I used to be too hard on my gums when using a manual tooth brush but the Oral B Professional Care tooth brush stops by itself if you push too hard. Easy to use and to take care of.</li>
    <li> This product exceeds my expectations.  My mouth feels so clean after brushing  and to me, my teeth look whiter.  I really appreciate the fact that the power brush removes a substantial amount of plaque and tartar from around my gums and from between my teeth in hard to reach places.  I highly recommend this Oral-B   power brush to others.</li>
    <li> I got this model for only $22 because CVS was clearing out the 1000 from their shelves for the arrival of the newer stock. My previous brush was the Oral B \\&quot;Cross Action\\&quot; AA battery powered brush. Until I used the 1000, I was satisfied with the Cross-Action. It was a good brush using a single battery and the brush heads were fairly good quality being Oral B.    But now there&#x27;s no going back. Honestly, I would not have purchased it - had it been selling at its former retail cost of over $80, but since my daughter is a manager at a local CVS, I was an early bird for the clearance - and sprang for the $22. So looking here at Amazon to see what others paid and what they think of this model prompted me to write my two cents worth in the form of a review.    The motor is comparatively very quiet, yet obviously powerful. The cleaning result is superb, and noticeably improved over my former brush. The brush heads do seem tougher so far as the expected life and the dual action head is my personal fav.  My teeth feel noticeably smoother and gums more massaged. Tongue cleaning with the brush is very thorough as well. A good toothpaste will accent itself using this brush.    Personally, I find the timer to be a slight nuisance more than a feature. I agree that over brushing - like applying too much pressure - is bad. But when I&#x27;m brushing, I don&#x27;t like the nanosecond interruption of the motor frequency change - however-minor. But that&#x27;s just me.     Other reviewers commented about the battery, as if it&#x27;s \\&quot;a negative\\&quot; feature. Admittedly, it would be better if it was Lithium-Ion, but then its cost would have been even higher.     However, being a Ni-MH battery pack - it is an improvement over the older Ni-Cad type. It has more capacity and cannot be over-charged by the included charger. The owners manual is very clear to point this out and even instructs to discharge it fully every (6) months to maintain optimum power, duty cycle, and battery life. I don&#x27;t think that is a negative, just the proper care for a device using this type of battery. Those interested could consult Wikipedia on NiMH batteries for a better scoop. Personally, I have not noted any degraded operation whatsoever in constantly charging mine all times when not being used, (and I doubt anyone else would either - for years).    The only negative I see is the price for the replacement brush heads. Hopefully, being made more aware of the cautions stated against over-pressure and over-brushing will also yield longer brush head life. The pricing seems outrageous. The cost for the better brush heads OTC @CVS was $26 for a(3) pack. Amazon lists them for less, but they are as much or more after shipping is applied. So make &#x27;em last long as you can as you enjoy this great quality toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This is my third oral b toothbrush and first 7400...this is by far the best cleaning toothbrush I have ever used. It cleans greats, cleans up easy and charges fast. It also holds a charge for a couple of weeks so its great to take with you on vacation and you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it while your traveling. only down side is the base is kind of small and tips easily, but its cleaning ability more than makes up for that. I would recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 74 and did NOT think it necessary to get an electric toothbrush.  I kept telling myself that I could do just as good a job manually.  Well, guess what?  I could not and cannot.  After visiting my dentist and told that I was not doing a good job brushing behind my capped front teeth and unless I started doing a better job, I could lose them.  Guess what? I ordered an Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush from Amazon on my I-Phone before getting home to order on my desk top computer.  I am totally satisfied with my Oral-B Toothbrush.  (And so is my dentist).    Thanks Oral-B,    Ray J.  Palm Harbor, Fl</li>
    <li> Changed to this from a battery operated Oral-B.  I am so glad that I did.  My teeth seem so much cleaner and I find I am not brushing as hard.  I let the toothbrush do the work.  I have a difficult time reaching my back teeth and this work perfectly.  I bought the sensitive brush heads and like that I can swith between both kinds.  I never mind going to the dentist, but cannot wait until my next appointment to hear what they say.</li>
    <li> We like the Oral-B&#x27;s and this one has tons of power, looks sleek and does a great cleaning job. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It really cleans well. I bought this for myself and my husband and when it arrived I realized it did not have a holder for the brushes. Not a problem for us as I found a little dish to use but if multiple people are using this you may want to consider another model that has brush holders.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I bought the cheapy Oral-B power toothbrush, decided it was time for an upgrade and boy was this an upgrade.  I love this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> Got this as a birthday present for my fiance.  With the 50% promo going on it came a great price.  She said it works great.  I have an older model and will always buy Oral-B.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush 3 years later.</li>
    <li> ordered Sept 2, and this is the 12th and still no delivery. Please respopnd. Can&#x27;t rate haven&#x27;t got product</li>
    <li> The toothbrush doesn&#x27;t work very well with cleaning behind the braces but does the job very well everywhere else. I have to go back and clean behind the braces with a different toothbrush but the oral-b is worth all the praise it is getting. It is a very solid toothbrush and the mail in rebate offer made it a lot sweeter.</li>
    <li> All seems well with this electric toothbrush.  I can&#x27;t really detect the variations in speed when selecting the change.  It does brush and clean well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe electric brush performs better than manual until I bought this. It really does a good job. The only complain I have is it&#x27;s getting louder.</li>
    <li> You must use it to believe it since this is my 4th oral B, 1000, 4000, 5000 models which all good, you&#x27;ll feel the different after brush, and will buy them and use them as always since it is the only best out there, no bad thing so far to tell.....  Go buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these during a Today&#x27;s Deal and I am so glad I did.....these are really perfect.  The dual head does a fantastic job, the brush is much lighter than my other electric toothbrushes of the past, that have all been hiding under the sink.  Just a few days of brushing with this and you will notice a huge difference in your gums and your teeth.</li>
    <li> I had used the Sonicare brand for at least ten years.  Just got tired of the high prices everyone was asking for them.  Tried the Oral-B and can say it does clean the teeth, just is a different circular type of brush movement versus the up and down movement of Sonicare.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get use to it....and for the difference in price.....yeah, think I&#x27;ll adjust just fine.  My teeth are just as clean as with the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected. For years I always used another well known brand.  Now I am glad having made the change.</li>
    <li> The nice thing about this toothbrush is that it uses the same heads as most of Oral-B&#x27;s other toothbrushes.  This is a basic model, which probably cleans just as well as their other models.  The battery lasted me about a week of twice a day brushing, and the battery indicator tells you when you&#x27;ll need to recharge it a few brushing sessions in advance.  Don&#x27;t ignore it too long, because it takes about 18 hours to charge it fully, but charging it about an hour should be good enough for one brushing.  The charger is small and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in a drawer.    The small head really works well for cleaning the sides of your teeth and between them.  Oral-B talks about the cupping action and it really works like the polishing tools most hygienists use.  It even seemed to dig food particles stuck between my teeth(!), but you&#x27;ll still want to floss where no toothbrush can reach.  If you have gum issues, this may be the ideal toothbrush for you.    The dual clean head got my teeth acceptably clean faster, but it&#x27;s noticeably bigger and the precision clean head worked better overall for me. It&#x27;s nice that they included two different brush heads so you can see which you prefer.    Unfortunately, the slower pulsing action seems to irritate my teeth.  A week or two after I started using this toothbrush, my molars started to ache. I ended up returning it and going back to my other Oral-B, whose head looks more like a normal toothbrush which vibrates up &amp; down very quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t clean along the gum line quite as well, but seems to clean the grinding surfaces of molars slightly better.    Oral-B also sells softer toothbrush heads which people seem to like and may be better for my sensitive teeth.    I added another star for Amazon&#x27;s good customer service and considering that most people don&#x27;t seem to have sensitive teeth.  In general, just about any electric toothbrush will do a much better job cleaning your teeth, removing plaque, etc., etc. - much better than a manual brush.  Try one.  If you don&#x27;t like it, a different type may be better for you too.</li>
    <li> This is a very powerful toothbrush, yet does not damage the gums like so many I have tried in the past. I am particularly pleased with that fact. My teeth do feel like I have just visted the dentist for a cleaning and it is great getting between the teeth. I would recommend this to anyone who may be reluctant to purchase this.....it does the job with out hurting the gums.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 for my husband and I and we love the clean feeling it leaves.  Very powerful and I also received a 15.00 rebate offer inside both boxes!!  Which made it an even better deal.  Glad I bought them</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an earlier oral b brush.  Since I have been using this brand of brush, my dental cleanings have been minimal.  My hygienist always comments on the lack of plaque and the state of my oral health.  I would and have recommended using it.</li>
    <li> I hate brushing my teeth and have used electric toothbrushes in the past but could not use toothpaste with the early ones.  I love this one.  I can use toothpaste and there are a variety of different heads you can use.  Especially like the timer.  Two minute timer with 30 second bleeps to indicate how far along you are.  I can honestly say I like brushing now and it does a really good job!!</li>
    <li> Not much I can say about a TOOTHBRUSH. It gets the job done. It&#x27;s comfortable and certainly cleans my teeth better than a regular manual toothbrush. Also, the vibrations every 30 seconds help keep track of the 2 mins we should all spend brushing teeth. This sounds like an unnecessary stupid feature, but trust me, the moment you use this toothbrush you realize you&#x27;ve never spent the advisable time brushing your teeth, not even half.     Overall a good purchase, I&#x27;m happy with it. My teeth are cleaner than they ever were.</li>
    <li> When my previous Oral B power brush finally stopped working (after 7+ years), I definitely was going to buy another one.  The old one was great but this newer model is so much better.  The speed is much faster, it&#x27;s quieter, cleans more thoroughly and doesn&#x27;t irritate your gums, even if you put pressure.  The noise changes if you press too hard and also at 30 second intervals to let you know how long to spend in each quadrant of your mouth.  My teeth are cleaner and whiter than with the previous model I had, I almost wish it had died sooner so I could buy this one. The battery life is decent, ours get used 4 times a day for about 5 days on one charge. It really provides a dentist like clean if you use it properly and though the replacement brushes can be pricey, I&#x27;d consider it worth having a healthy mouth and avoiding expensive and painful dental procedures.</li>
    <li> I recommend the Braun Oral B 3D Plaque Remover to all my patients. This brush is better than manual brushing and is great for people who may have a problem with dexterity or arthritis.  Even children will benefit from this, with adult supervision of course.  You will be happy with the results as I am when I see my patients&#x27; healthy gingiva. I also use this product too and love it.</li>
    <li> I began to feel a ridge on my upper molars and asked my dentist about it.  He said I my gums were begining to recede and suggested buying a circle tooth brush.  I didn&#x27;t know what to buy so I looked around and read several reviews.  The Braun brushes were rated high and Bruns guarrantee was too good to pass up.  I&#x27;ve had my Oral-B 3D Excel for a few months now and I love it.  After brushing it feels like you just left the dentists office.  I highly recommend the 3D Excel.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th electric toothbrush, and by far is the best performer.  Had a cheaper version of the Braun model which filled with water with regular use, and subsequently malfunctioned.  Reluctantly, we purchased this brush which is very similar in design.  As of yet, no water has collected inside the toothbrush.  This model is very powerful and does the job it is advertized to do.  We purchased this particular model because it is the only one proven to be more effective than regular brushing in a clinical study.  I agree that the results are consistent with the study, and hope that we do not get more water in the toothbrush (not covered by warranty, FYI)</li>
    <li> This is a weird little gadget.  Technically, it&#x27;s been flawless.  We plugged it in, we charged it, it worked.  Since then, it&#x27;s continued to work.&lt;br /&gt;The weirdness is in the way it feels.  Even at its stronger setting, it&#x27;s very gentle.  I&#x27;m used to mashing my brush against my teeth like some kind of barbarian dental hygenist.  With this, if I press too hard, it complains.&lt;br /&gt;The real test, though, is its ability to clean my teeth.  When I finish using this thing, my teeth feel at least as clean as if I used a manual brush.  I feel like they shouldn&#x27;t, but they do.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;It works.  What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> Prior to having this, I used a different powered toothbrush. After just a few months of use, I noticed my teeth weren&#x27;t any cleaner JUST AFTER using the wretched thing! So for awhile after that, I was scrubbin&#x27; &#x27;em \\&quot;old school\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No tooth-scratching here, ladies and gentlemen. Two minutes go by so quickly! I find myself using it for four, I&#x27;m enjoying myself so much. LOVE the timer! You can tell some serious motion is going on with the brush head because your nose and upper lip will tickle. That kind of brush motion makes for me to trust this little gizmo. The unit also has a nice compartment for holding up to four brush heads, which have color-coded distinctions. You can mount the unit on the wall, if you&#x27;d like. The replacement brush heads are worth it. You should be, too.</li>
    <li> I had an Oral-B power toothbrush for years and it died a few months ago.  Being frugal, I opted to use a regular (non-powered) brush I received from my dentist.  But, I couldn&#x27;t stand it -- my teeth never felt clean.  So, I bought a new Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush and I love it!  FYI: On the oral-b website, you can see reviews of other oral-b power toothbrushes, which is what I did.  Based on those reviews, I bought the 1000 series and am obviously very happy.</li>
    <li> It is convenient.  The power lasts for trips as long as 2 weeks without a recharge.  It cleans tea stains from my teeth.</li>
    <li> Just to clarify...this is actually the Oral-B ProfessionalCare 7400 (not sure why Amazon is using the part number as the model).  Inside the box, it contains   - 1 Oral-B ProfessionalCare Power Handle and Charger  - 1 FlexiSoft Brushhead  - 1 DualAction Brushhead    That&#x27;s it.  It doesn&#x27;t have extra flexisoft brushheads, Interspace brushheads, or Powertip heads.  I spoke to the Amazon CSR and told them to fix it almost 3 weeks ago, but it is still wrong....    Now aside from the misleading details, the toothbrush is great and works like everyone said.  Since it was my first electric toothbrush, I thought the first time I used it that I needed to brush really hard in conjunction with the vibration.  But after a few tries, I realize that you just need to \\&quot;stir\\&quot; gently in circles and let the toothbrush do the work.    Just a few notes to beware of...the head does tend to retain water, so make sure you flick it dry before you put it in the storage compartment.  I would also recommend that people give it a FULL charge (16 hours) before the first use (as stated in the manual).</li>
    <li> We bought this model three years ago for my wife after she had a painful and expensive root canal. At first she had to use the low speed setting, but in a couple of weeks she could use the normal setting. This brush can be used to clean your entire mouth, including the tongue. You can brush using just saline water (a spoonful of salt to a glass of water), no toothpaste is required. Any way, it is recommended to use as little toothpaste as possible when you brush, so the small brush head is not a concern. It is in fact good, because it allows you to reach the back of your molars. The brush does a great job of cleaning.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this toothbrush, the only time my teeth really felt squeaky clean was after a visit to the dentist. Manual toothbrushes never quite combat that slightly furry feeling the way this fine pulsating toothbrush does. My only complaint about the toothbrush is the part of the charging unit that holds the brush heads. It is hard to clean and a certain amount of goo takes up residence in the bottom of the brush head holders - yick. Overall, though, the toothbrush is great.</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush for several years.  I was having around 1 cavity per visit to the dentist before buying this brush.  Now, I haven&#x27;t had one since.  That&#x27;s all I need to know.</li>
    <li> I should have bought one of these years ago.  It really does give you a dentist clean on your teeth.  I received it yesterday and put it on the charger.  I noticed that it uses Nickel Metal Hydride batteries.  They need proper care to last and get maximum capacity.  This is mentioned no where in the instructions.  Thankfully I am familiar with proper care and charging of batteries.  Anyway, these batteries are better than NiCads, which had an almost instant memory effect.  Memory in a battery is when you don&#x27;t discharge it completely and then recharge it.  The next time it will stop working at the point it was charged up.  Nickel Metal Hydride batteries can develop a memory, but it takes many times for it to happen.  Still, to get the fullest use of them, you should discharge them completely before recharging them.  Also, a complete charge before using to stabilize the battery.  Putting the toothbrush on the charger after each use will dramatically shorten the life of the battery.  Only charge it once it is dead.  It would be better if they were to move to Lithium Polymer batteries like laptops and cellphone use.  The have no memory effect, only a finite number of charge cycles before the battery starts to quickly degrade.  If the battery is not discharged past 60% it won&#x27;t use up a charge cycle.  So with Lithium Polymer batteries it is not only OK, it is desirable to put them on charge after each use.  I expect to get a long useful life out of my unit.  Anyway, I think that most of the people reporting short battery life either had the previous revision with NiCad batteries or are not charging/discharging the batteries properly or both. [[ASIN:B000050FDE Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I used the toothbrush before going to bed and it was the cleanest my teeth ever felt outside of the dentist.  They still felt clean when I woke up in the morning.  I did learn the hard way not to hit the power button until the brush head was in mymouth.  It flung the toothpaste everywhere and made a mess.  I tried following the quadrant thing, but ended up using a pattern of my own for the two minute clean cycle.  The pressure sensor works quite well, it only activated a couple of times on me.</li>
    <li> Do you have migraines or Meniere&#x27;s disease or just have a sensitive head? Don&#x27;t get any of the pulsating Oral B brushes. They will just make you nauseous or trigger a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the classic Oral B electric brush for many years. A fantastic simple white design by Braun of Germany - since discontinued after Braun was bought by an American company. Now I have the simple low end non pulsing model. Essentially the same guts and head as the classic but with an ugly, over stylized, blue body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the battery started to die on my classic model, I picked up a pulsating Oral B. It is really banging away at your teeth and does as good a job as the non pulsatinging. But it vibrates your jaw and skull like, well, a vibrating electric tooth brush! After a month, it was just too much for me. I went back to the dieing battery original, but soon got its replacement as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict: I&#x27;m in my 40s and I&#x27;ve had about 6 different dentists (moving from job to job) in 5 different states. One was a professor at a dental college. After each visit, they all proclaim my teeth are in excellent shape. I use the cheapest Oral B electric brush (non pulsating) in the morning and before bed with Colgate Total. I also floss just one time before bed and use the Crest rinse for night time. I get them cleaned every 6-9 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and get the cheapest Oral B electric toothbrush. I think it is on sale sometimes for about $10.</li>
    <li> I just got braces a few months ago and this toothbrush does an excellent job at giving every tooth a precise clean. At first I thought it looked pretty weird with such a small brush, but it really takes care of each tooth individually. I love that it doesn&#x27;t use batteries and I only have to charge it about once a week. One thing I don&#x27;t like however is that I don&#x27;t think it signals you when it is fully charged. I left it on for at least 6 hours with it blinking green the entire time. Other than that, this is a great toothbrush. I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to manual cleaning.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this toothbrush.  My teeth feel much cleaner then when I used to brush manually.  The whitening brush head has made a good difference on my teeth.  It is not the same as a whitening at the dentist, but it does lesson/remove light stains. This brush leaves my teeth feeling very smooth and clean.  I would have given it a five but I do think you have to recharge it pretty frequently.  Usually every 3-4 days.  I don&#x27;t keep mine plugged in everyday because I try to conserve energy even though you can.</li>
    <li> I have been used electronic brush for over 3 years now. I am tired of changing batteries in my old electronic brushes once a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral B 7550 sets its price at a acceptable range (I bought it when it was on sale), for about 35-50 dollars, I think they would be your number one choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decide is very decent, and everything works out quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this set, you don&#x27;t need to worry about changing batteries, just charnge it once a week would be fine (when the battery is in new condition), I am expecting it could last for about 3 years, so divide the price down to per year, it is really cheap. (I know that the brush heads still cost additional money)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like using electronic brush like me, choose this product will be good to go. I am not a rich guy so I avoid buying those product cost like 50 to even more than 100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do almost the same things, so why not just get the basic functions. As long as it can clean up your teeth, that is the most important function I am looking for.</li>
    <li> The Oral B&#x27;s have set the standard for electric toothbrushes.  The new ones, however, have a much faster and smoother motor, giving a perceptibly more comfortable and effective brushing.  Two speeds is also a useful function, not a pointless bell or whistle.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist told me to buy a power toothbrush that has an auto shut off when I apply too much pressure. This is the one I chose. It cleans my teeth so well. I just apply the same technique the hygienist uses. I just hold it against the gumline and let it do its thing. The only problem I found is that if I turn it on before I put it in my mouth, it will splatter. The battery lasts about two weeks and charges in about 18 hours, but can be used during that time.</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun for several years now and my first electric toothbrush from them finally died. My son had zero cavities upon getting his braces off whereas my daughter had eight cavities....the only difference was using an electric toothbrush.  &lt;br /&gt;When looking for a new one I just want to brush my teeth and some of these new models have just too many options (i.e. varying speeds, multiple brushes, multiple warnings....) this one seemed simple enough. I couldn&#x27;t be happier - it works soooooo much better than the last model that we had but it is still simple. The speed is faster than the last model and the holder has space for three brushes. It is great to always feel like I have just visited the dentist!!!</li>
    <li> This Power Toothbrush is a replacement for a long used older model Braun electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: like new longer body, blinking charger light. Good battery reserve for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Brush is to stiff, two speed is not necessary. I prefer low speed over high speed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product over 2 years ago. This is my first electric toothbrush. I am extremely happy with the product. My teeth have gotten healthier since the time I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its superfast pulsating, oscillating, and rotating actions loosen and remove plaque from teeth and gum very effectively, and remove stains too. It has two speed settings, and an automatic timer that makes the brush stutter when the recommended two minute brushing time is reached. The bristles are so soft that it is a pleasure to use the brush to massage the gum. My brush is still going strong -- thanks to Braun&#x27;s quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only regret is when I bought this brush, I paid a much higher price. The price has come down over the years. But I have saved on toothpaste consumption (electric brushheads can hold much less toothpaste than manual toothbrushes)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought one of the Braun Oral-B 3D toothbrushes about 2 years ago when they first came out.  I am one of those people who dreads going to the dentist ( probably beacause of the inevitable cavity).  It was about 4 years since I went to the dentist when I went last week.  I fully expected big problems like cavities or even a root canal, because when I had gone to the dentist last time (4 years ago) I had a couple cavities and also some gingivitis.  To make matters worse I drink soda almost every day.  After I told my dentist this I could see the Dollar signs in his eyes.  He did a ton of x-rays, and then left to examine them.  When he came back into the room, he had a kind of stunned look on his face.  I had no cavities and my gums were perfect.  No, I never floss either.  I told him that I had been using the Braun for the last 2 years.  He told me to definetly continue using it.  I only brush at night, but I always go the full 2 minutes on the timer.  By the way, my wife had been using the Braun for the same amount of time.  She saw the same dentist on the same day.  No cavities after 2 years and perfect gums.  Buy the 3-D.  It&#x27;s DEFINETLY worth the extra money.  P.S., I use the cheap Ultra Brite toothpaste.</li>
    <li> After years of nagging by my dentist, I finally caved in and bought this toothbrush. It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;My dentist told me that if you&#x27;re good about brushing your teeth with a regular brush, you can prevent plaque build-up from occurring -- but if you&#x27;re not careful for a few days then you&#x27;ll have plaque build-up which you won&#x27;t be able to remove. You&#x27;re stuck having to go to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Not so if you&#x27;ve got this toothbrush! I actually got this toothbrush after having been a little careless for a few days and being unable to get my teeth to feel clean no matter how thoroughly I brushed them. With this brush everything was squeaky clean in minutes!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found it to be reliable, effective, and simple. It&#x27;s a noisier and messier than an old fashioned toothbrush, but there&#x27;s not much to be done about that. The battery holds its charge long enough to leave the charger home on trips.</li>
    <li> I hate visiting the dentist, just like everyone else. However, back in 1994-1995 my friend (who&#x27;s a dental assistant no less) recommend the new Braun/OralB Plaque Remover.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I have been using it every day since. Actually, the first one died after 5 years (what do you expect for a Ni-Cad battery) and my replacement unit just died this past month. So I am on my quest to purchase my third unit. And that&#x27;s not a bad thing. I think 4 years use out of each one is pretty decent.&lt;br /&gt;All of the other positive reviews here on Amazon are correct. The Braun Oral-B Plaque Remover does get your teeth really clean. It gets into places where you just can brush very well manually.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have one, get one -- that is, if your teeth are important to you.&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/6/04: Almost 2 years have passed since I wrote the review above. The products are still working great, however, the brushes seem to be losing power as time goes on. I&#x27;ve followed the discharging instructions included with the product, but it still has not helped. Therefore, my rating has gone from 5 stars, to 4.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to Oral-B several times about this, but never received a reply. My previous Oral-B brushes had the same problem, but I attributed it to the fact that they had Ni-Cad batteries whereas the new ones have Nickel-Hydride.</li>
    <li> I have crooked teeth and have always had problems controlling tartar buildup.  Even flossing is difficult because the floss gets trapped between teeth.  &lt;br /&gt;Within a week of using this toothbrush I noticed a clear reduction in tartar.  It was actually scrubbing off the tartar like a dentists cleaning.  This was using the special Oral B toothpaste, which has a gritty feel, like what the dentist uses.&lt;br /&gt;Now I alternate between the gritty (advantage) tootpaste and ordinary toothpaste.  I am far happier with my standard of dental hygiene and with the condition of my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can share the same toothbrush between different people as the heads are interchangeable, and are colour coded for just this purpose. &lt;br /&gt;The one drawback is the expense of new heads for the toothbrush.  They are expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a coffee addict and the other day got more than I wanted to see while looking in the mirror, after flossing.  I go to the dentist every six months and STILL get some brown stains on the insides of my teeth, where I guess I&#x27;m just flat out not paying enough attention to when brushing.  So, I didn&#x27;t have any great &#x27;quest&#x27; to find the best power toothbrush, I just surmised anything &#x27;power&#x27; would be better than manually brushing and the Braun Excel just hit the mark for me.&lt;br /&gt;You can go to the Braun site, and if so inclined, read the professional reports on where the Braun edged out the SoniCare; to me, I had a different reason for selecting the Braun.  The toothbrush HEAD is just so much more compact on the Braun than that of the SoniCare.  The upside to this is you can really get the Braun into the small areas in the back of your mouth; plus the Braun has some type of &#x27;clutch&#x27; or something that won&#x27;t allow you to press TOO hard against your gums.  Nice touch, Braun!&lt;br /&gt;The downside to the little head is that you really can&#x27;t get enough toothpaste on it (least I can&#x27;t) to do both your upper AND lower teeth from one application.  So, I&#x27;ve gotten into the ritual of using a little dab, do the tops, add another dab and do the bottoms.  It&#x27;s not EVEN an inconvenience, because quite honestely, the Braun DOES make brushing fun; at least as fun as it can get, I guess!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ll use a strong whitening toothpaste, such as Rembrandt&#x27;s, when you&#x27;re done, your teeth feel squeaky clean.  Don&#x27;t mistake this for a dentist&#x27;s cleaning, but it&#x27;s as close as a consumer can get them.  I&#x27;m VERY pleased.  &lt;br /&gt;Overall, one of those appliances I wish I could get excited about (my dentist probably wishes the same), but it&#x27;s utilitarian to me.  MUCH better than manually brushing, small and compact and VERY well made.  &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended in every way.</li>
    <li> Just got this and I cannot say enough how much I LOVE it!  My teeth feel SO clean, like I just got home from the dentist, and I know they are!  I have tried Sonicare in the past and it hurt my gums but this toothbrush manages to get a good strong clean without hurting at all--in fact it feels great!  I love it and can&#x27;t wait to get all the attachments they make.  What an incredible value too!</li>
    <li> I noticed my teeth, gums, etc., felt extra clean after the first couple of brushings. Excellent variety of replacement brushes. Particularly impressed with the timing option which helps to ensure all areas are cleaned on a consistent basis.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush did a great job and I loved how my teeth felt after cleaning, but after just 1 week of use the vibrations loosened the screw in my dental implant.  At the time I&#x27;d only had the implant for 7 weeks and the dentist had just put in the permanent filling to cover the screw the same day I started using the toothbrush.  I was panicked that the implant had failed, but I did some googling and found some information that the vibrations from the toothbrush can loosen dental implant screws.  I don&#x27;t want to take the chance that this will happen again, I don&#x27;t want the screw to become stripped.  So I will not be using this toothbrush, or any electric toothbrush for that matter.  Luckily, my spouse can continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Edit 02/12/12:  Brush is still working fine although it cannot hold a charge longer than 48 hours without being placed on the base unit. The newer heads fit this unit like a glove. Would not hesitate to buy this again!  Best electric toothbrush I have owned to date. My teeth feel like polished jewels in my mouth. Seems to recharge quickly. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the blue light on the unit is too bright for my taste (when the lights are off). Then again if you need a nightlight and a toothbrush you&#x27;re all set with this one! The rubberized handle is awesome. The 2 speeds are nicely spaced apart. I love the sanitary storage area for the brush heads! Excellent idea and design! Easy to get the heads back out again as the whole tray lifts out so you can grab a brush head or wash off the tray. If/when this ever breaks I would buy another one immediately. My teeth are actually whiter now but your results will vary with your brushign habits and toothpaste I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> Should have bought this years ago when my dentist told me to.</li>
    <li> It works. just like the one it replaced.  First-time charging is quite slow, so be prepared.  Also the rubber coating on the last one of these I bought discolored quickly, and the one before that the coating became sticky after a while.  I am hoping this third one is better.</li>
    <li> Out of 5 stars, I subtracted one star because I did not receive the correct product model. I ordered an Oral-B Professional Care 7550 Power Toothbrush, but I received a 7400 model. I subtracted one more star because I did not experience the customer service and therefore cannot recommend it. According to my invoice, Target.direct sold me the product. I ordered a new product and received a new product. My power toothbrush has been functioning fully since I received it near the beginning of June 2007.</li>
    <li> When my 7 year old Oral-B power toothbrush crapped out I upgraded to this one and absolutely love it!  The difference between brush with an old ordinary toothbrush and an oral-b is the difference between night and day.  I have sensitive teeth/gums and this bush is perfect for an amazing cleaning and remaining sensitive to my teeth/gums.  Great buy at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Oral B toothbrush and this is the first one that seems to \\&quot;hiccup\\&quot; while in use. The power seems to pulsate? I&#x27;m not quite sure how to explain it but I do think this is a defect. It does get my teeth clean but the power seems to hesitate while I am using it, which is very annoying. It&#x27;s not a question of being charged, it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the comments of another reviewer, I realize this was my mistake so I am changing my rating to 5 stars. At first I found the \\&quot;hiccup\\&quot; annoying, but I am used to it now.</li>
    <li> As time goes on in life we often find out that we&#x27;ve been doing everything all wrong. We look back at our deterioting health and notice that had we made the adjustments then, we would be ding much much better now. When you get a tooth brush like this you can&#x27;t help but hate your parents a little bit. I grew up with the belief that a medium tooth brush and good hard brushing was the way. Then I started to get yelled at by my dentist for ripping my gums out. I at the time thought that unless you brush like you mean it, your not going to get your teeth clean. Then, I was turned on to soft bristled tooth brushes. I thought that was the way, then a few years later I got a battery operated tooth brush and for a while thought that nothing could top it. Now comes this, it&#x27;s an amazing blend of genius for good hydgine keepers, and a blend of idiot proof add on&#x27;s for people like me that have been brushing to hard for their entire lives. The bristles are soft, if holds a charge for well over a week and pressing to hard will shut the brush down as doing so will actually cause more damage than good. The tooth brush itself is nice and form fitting for the average hand, unless your a child it fits perfectly, the charging dock is elegent in design, just set the brush on top and waa-lah charging. The charge indicator is simple. If it&#x27;s dying, it blinks red. There is no need for an LCD there since I can&#x27;t look down at it while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;My mouth feels cleaner, I&#x27;m mad at people for never turning me on to this earlier however better late than never.</li>
    <li> I had the older version of this from a couple of years back, and that older one felt stronger - and is still going strong. I got this one for my husband, and I did not like it nearly as much. The water tends to splatter more than my old one, and the vibration is bigger but not deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid, though, it was fine. I just can&#x27;t justify giving it 5 stars when it doesn&#x27;t add up to the quality of its previous versions.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  I had been using a battery operated toothbrush from walmart for $8 and this Oral B toothbrush blew it away. I wish I had bought it sooner. It is very powerful, which leaves your teeth feeling so clean you feel like you just left the dentist.  It&#x27;s powerful but doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums and I dont bleed at all.  It has a timer so you brush your teeth for 2 minutes, but only one setting-unlike the higher models. My teeth feel so much healthier so I bought one for my boyfriend and he loves it too.  Definately recommend. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> We own two of these toothbrushes.  There is nothing fancy on this model compared to the more expensive oral b counterparts.  It buzzes you ever 30 seconds to notify you of your brushing time and it has a charge indicator light - that&#x27;s about it.  The other oral b line has lcd screens and other things that just don&#x27;t seem that useful (at a much higher premium).  If you are a fan of the brush style, then you can&#x27;t go wrong with this \\&quot;lower\\&quot; end model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years. My dentist always compliments me on the quality of my oral hygiene and I always credit the timed brushing assistance of my Oral-B. This Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush goes one better - it surges at half minute intervals so that you can easily spend equal amounts of time on each quadrant of your mouth. What a helpful improvement, and this model costs less than any of my previous electric toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I paid the full... for mine, but had to return it just 3 months laterwhen it stopped working. The very unfriendly people at Braun sent me anew one (eventually), but that only worked for another 9 months untilit too stopped. I enjoyed using it, but I won&#x27;t bother getting anotherone until Braun get a quality control system in place.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush for two reasons:  First I read an article in BusinessWeek about how Braun&#x27;s line of mechanical toothbrushes have been helping Gilette&#x27;s revenues -- so I already knew about it.  Then, my friend bought upon referral, and said it was remarkable and suggested I get it.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is amazing!  I have cut down the time it takes to brush my teeth, gotten better results, and literally feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist each time I brush.  &lt;br /&gt;Btw, I highly recommend following up with a mouth wash (I use Listerine).</li>
    <li> This is a good toothbrush..as far as toothbrushes go but it&#x27;s really not worth the money.  The replacement heads cost quite a bit of money.  Overall, this electric toothbrush does about the same as ones that are a third of the price.</li>
    <li> Every time I brush with this unit I feel I came out of a dentist&#x27;s&lt;BR&gt;office. This unit covers all angles of your mouth like no other&lt;BR&gt;machine and the battery life is awesome. I can travel without the&lt;BR&gt;charger for a week without losing power from the motor.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush and I feel my teeth are really clean without brushing the heck out of them. Will always have this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a powered toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve been using now for over 3 months and there just isn&#x27;t a bad thing to say about the toothbrush.  I&#x27;ll never go back to a manual...&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are smooth and clean after every brushing...very similar to how they feel after going to the dentist for a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s top notch folks.  Buy without 2nd guessing.&lt;br /&gt;(I did buy mine with a half off rebate...which definitely helped me decide to take the plunge into the powered toothbrush world)</li>
    <li> The Oral B power toothbrushes we are using are fast and efficient. We can&#x27;t see doing without them.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have only used the precision brush, but have already started to see my teeth are getting whiter.  As for the modes that this toothbrush only has, well its simple, there is only 1 mode, and its called \\&quot;On\\&quot;.  Simple.  The only feature that I can see is that there is a built in timer to let you know how long you have been brushing (so you can target each area with an equal amount of time).  The toothbrush will vibrate twice every 30 seconds and when your recommended brushing time is up (2 minutes), it will vibrate a very distinct 3-4 times to let you know you are done.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the product.    One thing to mention - I purchased the product during a 50% off rebate period.  It&#x27;s been about a month and the rebate has not come yet.  For the price after rebate, outstanding product.  If the rebate never comes, its still good I suppose..</li>
    <li> I charged it for 18 hours as it requested from the get go. Once I start it up, after about every 15-20 seconds, it hiccups for 1 second.  Not bad of a product.  Feels different since I use less toothpaste now (compared to brushing manually).  I feel like a lazy hygienist now, with the lack of desire to brush my own teeth because the feeling of \\&quot;Success!\\&quot; and \\&quot;Clean!\\&quot; isnt&#x27; there anymore.  However, I will use this product until it is dead. I also bought it discounted from the amazon gold box.     If there were no hiccups, I&#x27;d give it a 4. that&#x27;s the main defect (with mine at least).  I do like the waterproof-ness, but I don&#x27;t need it since I don&#x27;t brush in the shower.    -MC    Update: Upping to 4star</li>
    <li> I finally got this toothbrush after I have seen alot of people use them.  I am very disappointed.  The design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky.  It&#x27;s constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste.  It&#x27;s very hard to clean.  It&#x27;s loud, and small brush.  Not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive.  No thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothbrush for 2 months now, so while I cannot really comment on subjects like longevity or reliability, I can say that it functions perfectly. &lt;br /&gt;Firstly, it cleans teeth and gums SO much better than manual toothbrushes, or my one previous electric (Bausch and Lomb Interplak). An experiment that I tried that you can duplicate (if you have any interest): eat a \\&quot;problem\\&quot; food that usually leaves bits stuck between your teeth. For me, this means blueberries (the skins) or tuna.  Brush with your manual brush. Then rinse and spit several times, until no more debris is coming out.  Now floss throughly and then rinse and spit several times again. How much more debris do you get now?  This is what your toothbrush did not get. Now try it again with the Oral B. &lt;br /&gt;   With the Oral B brush, my mouth FEELS much cleaner, and I end up with much less food left for the floss to get. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;   I chose the 7550 because I wanted the Oral B \\&quot;3D Brushing Action\\&quot; mechanism at the lowest price, and when I looked at the various models for sale, it seemed that the major difference between them (that was not just gimmicks) was the number and types of brush heads that were included with each model. I figured that since these were expendables, I would be buying more of them over the years anyway.  In the end, the 7550 with the four brush heads that are included and 6 refills that I bought at the same time cost less than some of the fancier models with fewer heads. &lt;br /&gt;   The build-quality seems first-rate, the action that combines oscillation with in-and-out pulsations is very effective, and my teeth are thanking me.</li>
    <li> I had several Oral-B toothbrushes of different types. None of them worked longer than several months or a year. Biggest problem: water gets inside the toothbrush, and damages motor and rechargeable battery. It is very difficult to disassemble the toothbrush, clean it, and assemble it back. I had also Oral-B AA battery toothbrushes. Problems: batteries lose contact, battery lid breaks very easy.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric tooth brush. It works as advertised. Cleans teeth really fast and thoroughly. No problems learning to use it. The handle is somewhat difficult to hang onto when it gets sloppy with tooth paste because it is smooth. But I like using a powered brush and will probably never go back to the manual type.</li>
    <li> Our Oral B of 10 years finally bit the dust.  This is what we ordered &amp; it works great.  I like the 2 speeds for those sensitive areas.  Would not ever go back to a manual brush.  Try this, a goods deal.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good toothbrush for the price.  My dental assistant recommended it as a less expensive option.  It seems to do a good job and I like the small rotating head.</li>
    <li> First I have to say that I was sent the wrong product model which seems to be quite common, however I decided to keep the model sent and it has turned out to be more than satisfactory. My dentist recommended the oral B electric toothbrush and I can now see why. It does a great job and I am impressed when I brush, it is just like going to the dentist. I will be interested in the comments I get from the dentist on my next visit. This particular model came with two types of heads, has the 30 second timer feature and dual action heads. All in all this is just what the dentist recommended and it has worked as advertised. By the way the product I ordered was the excel model and I received the 7440 Professional.</li>
    <li> Although I ordered the model 7550, I received model 7400.  From the Amazon opinion survey, I knew this was a very common complaint among buyers of this product, but I didn&#x27;t heed their warnings.  It was too late to return the items (I bought two) before Christmas so Amazon offered me a discount for the mistake.  I took the discount, then found the model 7400 two days later at a cheaper price in the local Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.  In the end, I paid shipping charges to receive the wrong product at a rotten price.  Beware.</li>
    <li> If you order this product, you will receive a model 7400, not a 7550. I had to return it twice and ended up buying it elsewhere. It should be removed from the listing.</li>
    <li> 1. ordered model 7550  2. received model 7400  3. returned model 7400  4. reordered model 7550  5. received model 7400 again  6. returned model 7400 on 01/17  7. still waiting for my refund this 02/08</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for a Braun power toothbrush, and it is good.  One neat thing this one does is pulse a couple of times every 30 seconds, so you know when 2 minutes are up, and so you can spend 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth.  On not so good thing about this toothbrush is that you can&#x27;t mount the base/charger on the wall. (I could with the old Braun.)  Which means it just stands on the sink, and every week or so I pull the charger out and have the cord every which way across the sink.  Remember - don&#x27;t get the plug wet!</li>
    <li> Oral B are awesome toothbrushes.  Feels like my teeth are squeaky clean!    Price:    The brush heads are much more expensive than normal toothbrushes, so just be aware.  Also, there are a lot of \\&quot;fake\\&quot; brush heads out there, some are okay, some are not so okay.    The last handle I bought for me was in 2002 and cost $100 at Wal-Mart, and lasted for 9 years.    I bought my dad a Model 5000 two years ago for $44 on eBay.  Most were going for $55 on ebay at the time, so the price was unexpected.    I bought this Model 1000 for $35, thinking it was a good deal.  I found out later that the day before I bought it, it was on sale for $25, and the day after I bought it, it was $20 ($40 with a 50% off mail in rebate).  So... I paid more than necessary. However, I am not unhappy with the purchase.  If it lasts 5 years, it only cost $7/year.    -----    [...]</li>
    <li> December 18, 2015&lt;br /&gt; Replaced the battery with a Sanyo Eneloop. ZOOM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still works after three years and five months. The battery might not be 100%. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the idiotic pausing every 20-30 seconds. As if I need to be reminded that frequently. A reminder every two minutes would be okay.</li>
    <li> Fantastic toothbrush recommended by my dentist.  Cleans brilliantley, requires a charge every 10-12 days or so. Easy grip handle, and reaches the far back places with ease.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 8 months since I purchased this item. I&#x27;ve enjoyed Oral-B brushes for a long time and this one ranks right up there with the others I&#x27;ve tried. I like the battery indicator lights, which are great for traveling. The battery holds a charge for a very long time. There are a nice variety of brush heads that will work with this model as well. Good deal!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great but do not pack it if you&#x27;re flying to Europe for instance or some other places because the charge is 110wtts, can&#x27;t work on 240Watts power!! I was shocked when i found it out but, hey!</li>
    <li> I love the timer on it so it helps to keep the kids brushing and concentrating on each area as it has 4 30sec timers.  I have noticed a difference in my 11 year boys teeth and my own.</li>
    <li> this is my third Oral-B toothbrush and it&#x27;s the best one yet, faster, more powerful, works great and lots of features I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush/ have no complaints on this one.stays charged for almost a week. really cleans the teeth.</li>
    <li> I used my father&#x27;s Sonicare toothbrush for a few days.  I was utterly impressed with its cleaning ability.  So when I went home I purchased this toothbrush thinking they were the same.  It is nowhere near the Sonicare.  Spend the extra money on the Sonicare...you will thank me later.</li>
    <li> Pretty good toothbrush. Did not know that their wasn&#x27;t a sensitive setting on this one. Works well for my son&#x27;s braces, just a little bit too powerful.</li>
    <li> Had an older Oral-B that has worked for years...still does. I remember when I first got the older one, it was SUCH an improvement over my hand brushing. Well, I have that feeling again. The new one definitely does an even better job. Love the 30 second reminder and the signal if you are brushing too hard. Some reviews indicate problems with refill brushes ordered from Amazon suppliers. I had that problem too. They were too loose for my old model...had to hold them on in order to function. They actually fit on this model as do the good ones from Target etc. Got a $10 rebate from the Oral-B web site plus a $15 dental visit rebate from the same site. Happy I bought this.</li>
    <li> Not exactly as described in ad&#x27;s and manual. Operates at only one speed and I had to go out and get sensitive brush heads because it&#x27;s too powerful and can&#x27;t be adjusted. I&#x27;ve been using Oral B for over 10 years and this is the first one to disappoint.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent power toothbrush.  The price is right, and we are enjoying using it.  My husband and I will definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Should have spent the money long long ago. Timer feature is nice. My dentist was happier! Good for massaging gums for perio problems as well. To clean, the inside of the holder lifts out. Throw it in dishwasher with the two brushes and is disinfected(good especially after colds, etc.).</li>
    <li> I suggest you buy this, since it makes &lt;BR&gt;manual brushing almost primitive.&lt;br /&gt;But the timer needs work. If you take &lt;BR&gt;the brush out of your mouth to spit&lt;BR&gt;in between brushing, you basically&lt;BR&gt;need to turn the brush off for a&lt;BR&gt;second. If you don&#x27;t, your mirror &lt;BR&gt;will be full of toothpaste dots.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s easy enough, you just press&lt;BR&gt;the power button until you brush &lt;BR&gt;again. But if you want to use the&lt;BR&gt;timer, you can&#x27;t turn it off...&lt;br /&gt;For a ($) product, you&#x27;d think&lt;BR&gt;they&#x27;d figure this out enough&lt;BR&gt;to put a \\&quot;pause\\&quot; button that&lt;BR&gt;doesn&#x27;t reset the timer...&lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;d prefer that improvement&lt;BR&gt;over some silly grip feature&lt;BR&gt;they claim makes it better now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oral b electric toothbrushes for about 4-5 years now. My old model a solo, the base model, finally died after about 5 years, so I bought the 3-D Excel as a replacement.  The vibration feature is fantastic, the 2 minute timer is better than the 1 on the old model.  I&#x27;ve tried the sonicare brush, and the oral b is just so much more effective. I havent gotten a cavity in 5 years, and finally since at the advice of my herbalist, I&#x27;ve started using Peelu Dental Fibers (from a health food store) along with switching over to japanese Bamboo Salt toothpaste daily on the 3-d excel model, I have actually gotten rid of the gingivitis that has plagued me for the past 15 years, literally within 2 weeks (and even the gum treatments at the dentist did not do that).  I got this brush for my father as a gift (he&#x27;d been using manual toothbrushes) and he is so converted that he bought brushes for my mother, sister, and brother and law who were as he called it &amp;quot;brushing the primitive way&amp;quot;.  Honestly, my mouth does not feel clean brushing with anything else anymore. Its definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve very protective of my teeth and take very good care of them.  Yet after going to the dentist twice a year, brushing, flossing, using mouth wash, etc...I was always searching for a cleaner feel.  This Braun electric toothbrush is the answer I&#x27;ve been looking for.  This is my 1st electric toothbrush, and after the great reviews I&#x27;ve read on Amazon.com, I decided to give it a try.  It so easy and convienient to use and it makes my mouth feel clean all day long.  It&#x27;s cheesy to say, but it feels like it does after the dentist cleaning!  I recommend this product to anyone looking for a healthier mouth (one that others will want to kiss!).. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun electric brushes for over 10 years even though they are quite expensive. &lt;br /&gt;They work great, very comfortable to hold and the small head fits easily in one&#x27;s mouth. (as compared to the inexpensive colgate electric brushes).&lt;br /&gt;Most IMPORTANT - I&#x27;ve never had a cavity while using one of these brushes. When an old one broke several years ago, I went back to a manual brush and promptly got a cavity.&lt;br /&gt;BUT -- after a few years they all stop holding the charge and finally quit. When I open up the brush (which they aren&#x27;t made for) much of the internals have corroded. Apparently a small amount of water (and toothpaste) can seep into the brush. I&#x27;m not sure if this is what ruins the brush, or if the battery just finally gives out. Unfortuately, the brush isn&#x27;t servicable so I have to buy another one. That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush excellent; my denist recommened it to me. But the cost of replacment heads are way way way too much! after 3 replacements you&#x27;ve boughten another braun electric toothbrush. So, buy it and use it and pay the money. Or....if you&#x27;ve got the muscle and the time do it the old fashion way.</li>
    <li> My folks recommended getting one of these - nothing bad in my experience so far (about 4 months). Recharges overnight and lasts for about 2-3 weeks. Wish they had supplied a travel case or something ...it&#x27;s gone off in my luggage before. Makes your teeth feel squeaky clean and the two-minute feature helps out.</li>
    <li> This brush will get your teeth so clean that the hygienist will have a hard time finding anything to remove when he/she cleans your teeth.  You&#x27;ll have better dental health and it feels great.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never been cleaner. From the first time I used it and licked my teeth to feel how clean they were, I was impressed. I have never done nearly as good a job with a manual brush. And if this model can deliver that level of performance, I don&#x27;t see the need to spend triple digits on another kind.</li>
    <li> This product has the power and results of a professional cleaning. &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Oral B toothbrush arrived within the estimated time, however the charging unit would not power the brush. Amozon proptly forwarded a replacement and that toothbrush worked fine I would recommend this brush as a great cleaning agent for both teeth and gums</li>
    <li> I like this power brush.  It is my first one so I relied on previous reviews.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush so I don&#x27;t have any others to compare it to.  Having said that, this is a great toothbrush!  It takes about 18 hours to charge, but lasts for about two weeks. I am currently using the dual-clean brush and I have no complaints about the job it does.  I still try now and then to use it like a manual brush because I can&#x27;t get used to it doing the work for me.  I don&#x27;t dread brushing near as much since I&#x27;ve started using it because of how easy it is to use with little effort.  I was a little hesitant about buying this unit after reading the reviews regarding keeping it clean.  It is no harder to clean than a manual toothbrush.  Apparently the complaints about keeping it clean are from users who don&#x27;t believe in rinsing it after you use it.  The whole unit is water resistant and I simply rinse it under running water and run my finger through the bristles, then turn it on for a few seconds with the water still running and back off for a final rinse.  I do a firm downward shake into the sink to get the water out of the bristles, and then wipe the unit with a hand towel.  This is the same 30 second cleaning I would give any toothbrush to keep it sanitary.  It still looks new out of the box!  It does have a 30 second stutter that the instructions aren&#x27;t clear on for this model.  Every 30 seconds it stutters to let you know to move on to another quadrant of your mouth, but you can just keep right on brushing as long as you want.  One note, be careful when you&#x27;re opening the brushes because there is a colored spacer ring with it that needs to be pushed onto the bottom of the brush head before connecting to handle.  The only difference I can see in this unit and the more expensive units (that I&#x27;ve only handled but not used) is the LCD display that tells you how much battery is left.  This unit has a simple green/red light to show battery strength.</li>
    <li> We have an older model in our master bath that lasts much longer off the charger than this one, but other that, it has performed perfect with no complaints.  Has only one speed, which is fine if that doesn&#x27;t bother you.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does what it is supposed to do. Go figure...LOL. Great powered brush for the money. Just make sure you dry the brush before you place it on the charger. If you don&#x27;t it will start building junk up on the bottom and on the charger.</li>
    <li> The Oral B 3D is one of the best products on the market if your teeth matter to you. I have been using the Oral B for almost a year now, and my dentist has told me that he can see a marked difference in the condition and health of my gums and teeth! Since gum problems run in my family, this is a big deal. For those of us who have always been a bit lazy about brushing, the Oral B&#x27;s timer tells you when you&#x27;ve brushed enough; the multi-directional pulsations leave your teeth feeling really clean - like you just came from the dentist!  If you don&#x27;t have one of these, go buy one now. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Yes yes yes! I love this toothbrush! I will never be able to use a manual toothbrush again.  I look forward to that &amp;quot;fresh from the dentist&amp;quot; feeling every time I brush my teeth. &lt;br /&gt;My wisdom teeth grew in without problems, so I still have them back there and they are the most difficult teeth to brush.  My manual toothbrush simply wasn&#x27;t doing the job. If you think about it, the shape of a regular toothbrush just isn&#x27;t made to get to the back molars very well.  Now, not only are they getting brushed, they are getting polished!  Even the very back back of the teeth themselves thanks to the nice small round shape of the brushhead combined with the fast pulsating action.&lt;br /&gt;My gums are healthy and every one of my teeth are white and plaque free, what else can I say?</li>
    <li> REPLACED AN OLD ONE OF THE SAME BRAND NAME.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this toothbrush to replace one of the same brand name that I had for about 3-4 years.  The old one just broke.  Since I was pleased with it I decided to pick up this one.  One positive thing for doing that, is that it used the same brush ends and I had stock piles of them.  It is nice that I could use these and not have to buy new ones... at [money amount] each.&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO CLEAN STORAGE THING&lt;br /&gt;This one has a nice little storage thing for the tooth brushes.  This at first had me worried as the back of the toothbrushes, no matter how well you rinse and dry them, still drip, water and accumulated toothpaste at times.  Not to worry though.  This storage thing lifts right out and can be easily cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;BETTER DESIGNED TOOTHBRUSH HANDLE:&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush handle is also an improvement on its predecessor.  It is slimmer and longer and has a better gripping surface.&lt;br /&gt;REALLY FAST BRUSHING BUT TWO SPEEDS AVAILABLE:&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that took a while to get used to though was the speed..  This thing is zippy.  Luckily there are two speeds, but even the lowest is much faster than my old one.  However, you get used to it quick.  I also honestly think, it does a slightly better job.  Or maybe I do, due to the more manueverable handle.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product, I would buy it all over again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrushes for over a year now.  They do a great job on cleaning my teeth.  I love the rechargeable feature, the two minute timer and the speed settings.  The only drawback is that the brush is stiff.  I would rinse it in the water before using it.  It will also take time for your teeth to feel comfortable with this unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an older model for years and this one for several months now.  This is definately an improvement, but the old one worked well also (and still works for my daughter).  I only go to the dentist when I have a problem, so this does a great job of keeping my teeth and gums in top shape.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my teeth feel really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The last Comsumer Reports that I could find (August 1998) rated the Braun Oral-B #1.  However, it also said that you could do as well with a manual toothbrush if you used it properly.  I brushed so hard with a manual toothbrush that I broke some of the brushes.  I also wore a groove in the base of my teeth just above the gums.&lt;br /&gt;This gets my teeth cleaner and smoother than I could ever get them with a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare also looks like it would do a great job (Consumer Reports rated it #4), but it costs about twice as much.  And the replacement brushes also are much more expensive.  You might want to check ebay also.&lt;br /&gt;I would never brush for the full two minutes without the timer that is on it.  But, it is easy and it works well.  I also brush my gums, tongue and the roof of my mouth without any injury or soreness.&lt;br /&gt;I really feel that you&#x27;ll save enough at the dentist to pay for this several times over.  Give it a try, they offer a money back trial period.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested this brush to me 4 years ago. It has reversed my gingivitis, prevented ALL cavaties, and improved my breath.    Everyone should be using this brush if they want to keep their gums healthy.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Cybersonic toothbrush, but the battery on that stopped holding a charge (not even for a single session), so after reading that the Pulsating toothbrush was the best, I bought this.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It seems to clean much more vigorously than the sonic toothbrush I had been using.  It even made my gums bleed a little initially (though perhaps the Sonic simply didn&#x27;t firm up the gums enough), though that went away.  When I replace the brush head, it always feels a little rough on my gums, though that goes away over time. I&#x27;m not sure whether the worn brush head or the new one is actually better for my teeth/gums. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is that this toothbrush is MUCH noisier than the sonic brush.  Before I used to brush while watching TV, but now, I have to turn the TV way up to hear what&#x27;s going on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also the timer doesn&#x27;t start timing after you turn on the brush.  It starts timing since the last time it vibrated.  But I don&#x27;t really brush according to the timer anyway, so it&#x27;s not a big deal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unlike my sonic toothbrush, I have had no battery issues so far (after a year of use).</li>
    <li> This Oral B toothbrush does a very nice job at removing any and all gunk from my teeth.  Water actually taste like pure water.  Not that I did not brush my teeth well beforehand, but it honestly made me feel that way.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works fine but we received a Model 7400 and not the Model 7550 we ordered.  I had to call Amazon to get a credit for the difference in price because returning the wrong unit would have been another hassell I just didn&#x27;t need.  The Model 7400 has all the basic features so we will make do.  I will say that Amazon was very good about giving us a credit in a timely manner for the diffence in price between the two units.  Guess next time I&#x27;ll just go to the store and pick up what I need.  I paid the tax and shipping charges and it would probably be about the same as the price of gas to go to my local store.</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and decided it was time to get a power toothbrush. I decided to go with the Oral-B over the Sonicare per dentist recommendation. I am very happy with the decision.     It does take a little time getting used to brushing with a power toothbrush over a regular one. You have to get used to letting the toothbrush do the work. You also have to get used to the pulsating action, it can feel a little weird the first couple of brushes.    I have been working on brushing for the full 2 mins, I don&#x27;t find it that hard to do. It goes by pretty fast for me. I use the toothbrush&#x27;s built-in timer.    I also don&#x27;t have a problem with the toothbrush heads. I find I can reach the back teeth easier with this than a manual toothbrush. It is really not that uncomfortable for me either.     One thing I found that is an added bonus with this toothbrush are the \\&quot;Made in\\&quot; stampings on both the toothbrush and the charging base. I prefer to purchase as many things as I can that are made in America or Germany. It turns out both this toothbrush and charging base are made in Germany and not China.     I am also not certain about the reviews of this product stating that they meant to order the 7550 and got this toothbrush. I just ordered mine last week and I got what I ordered, the 7400.     I would recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oral b electric toothbrushes for about 4-5 years now. My old model a solo, the base model, finally died after about 5 years, so I bought the 3-D Excel as a replacement.  The vibration feature is fantastic, the 2 minute timer is better than the 1 on the old model.  I&#x27;ve tried the sonicare brush, and the oral b is just so much more effective. I havent gotten a cavity in 5 years, and finally since at the advice of my herbalist, I&#x27;ve started using Peelu Dental Fibers (from a health food store) along with switching over to japanese Bamboo Salt toothpaste daily on the 3-d excel model, I have actually gotten rid of the gingivitis that has plagued me for the past 15 years, literally within 2 weeks (and even the gum treatments at the dentist did not do that).

Honestly, my mouth does not feel clean brushing with anything else anymore. Its definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I started using this toothbrush on the advice of my sister (thanks, Sis!) and also after reading some studies confirming that an electronic toothbrush that uses both rotary and in-out pulsating motion will improve gum health. My dentist did notice an improvement in tartar build up. He said that he notes when patients use this brush and that it seems to give good results.&lt;br /&gt;Plus Points&lt;br /&gt;1. This brush has both rotary in and in-out pulsation. This is the combination that is better than rotary-only and that studies show gives better results.&lt;br /&gt;2. The replacement heads have an indicator that shows wear (the bristles become white. When the decolorization on the bristles is down to about 1/8 inch, it&#x27;s time to change the head.)&lt;br /&gt;3. There is a timer to let you know you have brushed 2 minutes (recommended brushing time.)&lt;br /&gt;4. It does feel like \\&quot;after the dentist cleaned\\&quot; if you go the whole 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Minus Points&lt;br /&gt;1. If you don&#x27;t recharge according to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation initially, you will not have a long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;2. The manufacturer doesn&#x27;t make this entirely clear, but you should run the charge DOWN on the brush, then recharge, for maximum life. If you don&#x27;t do this, you could experience a short life-span on this toothbrush. This happened to someone I know; the company made good on the guarantee and sent a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;3. If you DO let the charge run down, the brush is not so vigorous at the end and it seems a bit wimpy to do a really good job near the tag-end of the battery charge.&lt;br /&gt;4. You should go the 2 minutes for effective use, but who likes to stand there, spitting foam and grimacing in the mirror for that length of time?&lt;br /&gt;5. You should use it gently or you can scratch your gums.&lt;br /&gt;6. The replacement heads are a bit expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Despite the minus points, I rate this toothbrush five stars because I love how my teeth feel and it makes flossing afterwards better because I seem to have less tartar buildup. I am considering a second one to keep in my bag at work. I hate to brush with anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommendedconsidering a second one to keep in my bag at work. I hate to brush with anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I probably got this as one of my GoldBox deals (six months back!), turned out to be well worth the money.  My teeth look cleaner, and mouth feels fresher - I use Colgate Total along with this toothbrush.  Seems good for the gums, too.&lt;BR&gt;My only gripe is that I have never seen the blinkin&#x27; 2-minute timer switch on.  I am sure I brush longer than that!  I also wish it were more portable (less bulky/lighter).  It&#x27;s great at home.</li>
    <li> I was one of those people who didn&#x27;t have any tooth problems and didn&#x27;t see any need to go to the dentist. When I finally broke down and went to see my doctor there was a bit of cleaning to do and a strong recommendation to use this toothbrush.  I have to say it was the best thing I have ever done for my teeth and my smile!&lt;br /&gt;The small head allows me to reach all areas, even those in-between places.  Although I don&#x27;t normally brush for 2 full minutes, the built-in auto-timer works as a good signal that I&#x27;m done.  Because I feel more confident that the brush is cleaning well, I don&#x27;t feel a need to press hard and be rough on my gums.  I come away with confidence that my teeth and smile are both healthy.  My dentist has definitely noticed the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my Braun Oral-B 3D Excel for over 2 years and it is still working well.  It needs to be recharged a little more often (about 1x/week) than when it was new, but other than that it still works great.  I do find that water gets trapped in the metal stem housing and need to shake it out.  The colored bristles on the brush head are not a very reliable indicator of wear.  It seems to take a while for the blue color to fade and the brush needs replacement long before that happens.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I can only give you my experiences, I&#x27;m not an electric toothbrush expert.  I don&#x27;t know why they work, other than the stuff on the box about pulsating and vibrating.&lt;br /&gt;That cleared out of the way, I am amazed with this toothbrush.  I have even tested it against a normal toothbrush.  I used the electric the first day I brought it home (the day after my dental appointment).  I had just had a cleaning at the dentist, and was surprised to find that my teeth felt like they had when I left the dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;BR&gt;   I figured, \\&quot;Oh, it must be because I just had my teeth cleaned,\\&quot; so I had an experiment.  The next evening, I brushed my teeth with my regular toothbrush.  I scrubbed the dickens out of my teeth.  They felt about like they used to.  Then I took the electric to them for about 20 seconds, just enough time to pass it over all my teeth quickly, and there was a definite improvement.&lt;br /&gt;One down-side:  I find that I can&#x27;t keep from a little toothpaste drool.  It&#x27;s not messy, I just have to wash my chin afterwards (and I have a beard.)&lt;BR&gt;   &lt;BR&gt;******Final Thoughts*****&lt;br /&gt;Now, for why I bought THIS brush... It really is dentist recommended:&lt;BR&gt;     The last time I was at the dentist, (about two months before this review) he gave me no choice in the matter, he said I HAD to go buy an electric toothbrush, and he said this was the one to buy.  He told me about another one that was a couple of dollars less, but firmly stated that this was the best one to buy, so I did.&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have been back to the dentist twice (for fillings :P )and he can tell a marked difference.  So can I.  This toothbrush has my heart. (if a bathroom appliance can do such a thing)</li>
    <li> This brush is very difficult to use -- first of all, the place to put the toothpaste is very small, making it difficult to get enough.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it moves around so much it&#x27;s hard to keep the water in your mouth (it&#x27;s messy to use &amp; clean).&lt;br /&gt;Third, it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> My dentist scolded me for thrashing my gums by brushing too hard and for having too much plaque. He insisted I get the Braun Oral-B, which he said was the best of its kind. I&#x27;m glad I did. The design has a soft mode for people with sensitive gums and it has cut down my plaque, far better than had I used a conventional toothbrush. Also the device is easy to use and maintain so I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll use it consistently. Finally, I must say my teeth feel far more clean and smooth now. The Braun no doubt will have prevented me from getting some serious dental work.</li>
    <li> So far so good on this product. We&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an Oral B since 1993, and am on my 3rd one. The first one finally \\&quot;burned\\&quot; out a few years ago, and the 2nd one I somehow left in a motel room, and it conveniently got \\&quot;lost\\&quot; (hope the maid is enjoying it), as when I called that afternoon, \\&quot;nothing had been found\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cannot be beat. Like many other reviewers have said, the dentist&#x27;s ALWAYS notice the difference when people switch to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I always brush on high speed until it beeps, then I switch to low speed, and re-brush, and then go onto my gums and tongue before stopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Great Tool, from a Reliable Mfg., Not to be Beaten! If you&#x27;ve not used one of these, by all means, GO OUT AND GET YOURSELF ONE, NOW!! You&#x27;ll NEVER regret it! ~operabruin</li>
    <li> I already have an Oral-B Professional Care 9000 (discontinued), which has several settings.  I always use \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; but learned AFTER I opened THIS package (the 1000) that the 1000 does NOT have this feature.  The feature IS listed in the manual, but is not available on this particular model.  Very disappointing--and I just cannot use the 1000.  My gums just cannot take the beating.</li>
    <li> Just picked up an Oral-B Professional Care 1000 after using a Sonicare for years. . . even my wife, who has another Oral-B model, thinks this one is loud. And the vibration: makes my nose itch. And my nose isn&#x27;t THAT big. . .     Does everyone experience the high vibration and noise?</li>
    <li> Braun 1000 small head toothbrush is a replacement brush. Like the elongated handle and the size of the brush head. Wish Braun would make covers for their toothbrushes as most sit out in a bathroom which is germ filled.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m up and out early before the rest of the house and i would have preferred that this be a little quieter. I like the functionality and form, but the noise makes me reluctant to use it when others are sleeping. Likely just my perception, but it&#x27;s enough to limit it&#x27;s use for me.</li>
    <li> Love this one.  Feels like my teeth have been professionally cleaned after every brush.  The built in timer - letting you know when to move to a different section of your mouth - is a nice feature.  Just wish it has a brush head holder.</li>
    <li> B000050FDE: Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush  Am pleased as punch with this dental device, which puts others to shame.  In fact, the soniCare 1126 corpse that it replaced is patiently waiting for proper disposal.  I don&#x27;t know if toothbrushes have chemicals in them which would pollute the environment if given half a chance.  ¶ I don&#x27;t recall when the Philips soniCare was first used, but even at first brush, it never performed as well for me as the Oral-B.  Different strokes for different folks.  ¶ This Gold Box item leaves my mouth feeling super clean each time I use it, and I particularly like the double-head brushes.  Thank you, Amazon, for making this available to me at an \\&quot;irreteethable\\&quot; price.</li>
    <li> When my old Braun Oral-B conked out after 7 years of twice-daily use, there was no question I would replace it with a new Braun.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with this model.  It seems that the brushing motion is smoother, quieter and faster than my old faithful, and my teeth feel like they&#x27;ve just had a cleaning at the dentist.  Braun always comes through.  Really couldn&#x27;t be more impressed or happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Very good unit.  I hope it lasts as long as my last one.  I will buy my next one from Sam&#x27;s because they have the same unit.  THE BEST PART IS SAMS HAS THE TWIN PACK FOR $99.  If I would have known I could have had 2 for 50 dollars each instead of paying 68 dollars for one.</li>
    <li> I see the dentist every six months, and get a excellent check up each time,  I guess it is working like a charm.</li>
    <li> Great cleaning machine.</li>
    <li> I know there are higher end power toothbrushes available , but for the price (~$40), I don&#x27;t think this one can be beat.  Much better than manual and the two minute timer is a great feature.  Stand/charge is also very convenient.</li>
    <li> I spoke to oral b and found out that this brush is identical 100% to the oral b 7400. Which is more expensive. The only thing the oral b 7400 has is an extra brush. Its a no brainer to buy this one.</li>
    <li> I enjoy brushing now and I go the full two minutes most of the time &lt;br /&gt;and I try to get to all the surfaces and do a gum massage &lt;br /&gt;my teeth are cleaner. and I am happier. &lt;br /&gt;I researched and spoke with people and came up with this one - the more expensive oral b did nothing different and the other brands did not compare. I don&#x27;t have any problems with the battery yet so I can&#x27;t talk about that, though a friend who travels said she takes hers with her when she travels and has not lost a charge yet.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 7550 and received the 7400. so I returned it and requested the correct product. Again the 7400 arrived. This time I called Braun who makes the Oral-B product line. They explained that the 7400 and 7550 are the same toothbrushes, but that the 7550 comes with extra toothbrush heads. I called Amazon and requested a refund for the price difference. They couldn&#x27;t do it because the 7400 is actually more expensive than the 7550 even though they are the same product except that the 7440 contains fewer replacement brush heads. This is really crummy, but I am starting to travel now and just decided to get wronged and keep the 7400 because I needed a new toothbrush ASAP.</li>
    <li> I places an order for an Oral B 7550, instead I received an Oral B Vitality 12513. This does not come with storage compartment, etc. etc. Email was written but never got an answer.</li>
    <li> After reviewing several electric toothbrushes, I decided on the Oral-B 7400.  I didn&#x27;t realize at the time that there is only one cleaning mode but that turned out to be okay.  I thought I might need a sensitive mode in order to not hurt my gums.  Instead, I ordered softer brush refills which solved the problem.  I drink tea which stains my teeth.  I tried baking soda to remove the stain but that didn&#x27;t help.  After using this brush for a few weeks, the stains were gone.  Like others have said in their reviews, my dental hygienist noticed an improvement in my teeth.  I&#x27;m very happy with this brush and have bought two more for my daughters.</li>
    <li> We have used Oral-B products for 15 years; this new model is even better.  It is stronger yet thinner; generates different vibrations (3) around the toothbrush head and varies this according to pressure.  Also has a built-in timer.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush about 4 months ago and was really pleased with it until it stopped working recently.  It will turn on, but will slow down and eventually stop well before the recommended 2 minutes is up!  For the price, I would expect better quality control!</li>
    <li> Last January I bought the 3D Excel after a particularly depressing dentist visit in which he told me that my gums were pulling away and I was on the road to losing my teeth. He recommended that I get &#x27;one of the higher end electric toothbrushes.&#x27;  I did some research and chose the Braun/OralB version instead of Sonicare because more people told me they liked it and actually used it.  Well, boy does it work. Not only do my teeth feel super clean, every day, but I just went BACK to the dentist and he saw &amp;quot;huge improvement&amp;quot;.  Plus, he asked if I had tried whitening products because my teeth were really white.. and they weren&#x27;t before. Apparently, it was just the brush, because I hadn&#x27;t!  So, long story, but ... very satisfied customer. I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular toothbrush.. I want to keep my teeth!</li>
    <li> Like many of you reading this review, I was apprehensive making the switch to a power brush. First, I&#x27;m not one to jump on the &amp;amp;amp;quot;gimmick&amp;amp;amp;quot; bandwagon. And second, I don&#x27;t like to hand over my hard-earned dollars when there is an alternative (in this case...manual brushing)! However, I feel compelled to write a review on this wonderful product and relay some of my newfound experiences with this brush.       I actually have the 3D Pro 7500. All the 3D products have the same basic funtionality. However, the Pro line has dual speeds. This has proven very useful for sensitive areas, since you can ratchet down the speed when needed.      I have long been praised for having wonderful teeth, by the dentist. But, I have been starting to receive a number of comments regarding my gum-line and how I need to do a better job brushing and flossing. This has caused me to brush harder and now I am showing the beginning signs of receding gums.      TIME TO SWITCH...   After careful research, I decided to go with the Oral B line of power brushes. I couldn&#x27;t afford the pricetag of the competitor and have starting seeing more negative reviews, because of the bulkiness and price/performance benefit. Let me tell you...this is a wonderful product. I noticed a difference from the first time I used it. My teeth feel &amp;amp;amp;quot;polished&amp;amp;amp;quot; and there are no food particles left in my gum-line after a brushing.      In addition, you can actually feel how you are reaching the back teeth. It&#x27;s as if the brush head &amp;amp;amp;quot;hooks&amp;amp;amp;quot; the back teeth . It takes a little getting used to the sensation, which is actually a bit uncomfortable at first. However, stick with it to the end and you&#x27;ll notice the difference. It&#x27;s just like others have described...like coming out of the dentist&#x27;s chair everyday!      I personally cannot give it five stars, since I&#x27;ve only had the brush for 3 days and haven&#x27;t visited the dentist since owning it. But, I think itwill warrant a &amp;amp;amp;quot;five&amp;amp;amp;quot; in a couple of months after my next dental visit. Be forewarned, you will still have to floss, since nothing to date can reach between teeth, except for floss and a hook. However, your gums/teeth/breath will appreciate your renewed oral hygiene!      Get it...you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different models of Oral-B electric toothbrushes over the years and been very happy with all of them.  My dentist is always telling me that my teeth are in great shape, and even that my gums look great (and I don&#x27;t have the heart to tell him that I&#x27;m too lazy to floss).  The rotating bristles do really well at getting between the teeth and along the gumline, where it&#x27;s hard to clean with a manual brush.</li>
    <li> The first Oral B (similar model) that I had lasted more than 10 years, so when it finally died I looked for one that was as close as possible to it. I have been extremely happy with my purchase, the product has all the options that I find useful, and as usual Amazon offers the best overall prices.</li>
    <li> I had been thinking for some time of switching to an electric toothbrush and decided to go with this one because of the reputation of Braun products. Though I&#x27;ve only had the toothbrush for about one month I think I can safely say that this is a good product. It doesn&#x27;t take up much room even though I have a very small sink. It&#x27;s practically effortless to use as it does all of the brushing for you, so I brush for longer than I used to. The timer is great because it gives you a full two minutes and lets you know in 30 second intervals that it&#x27;s time to switch to a different quandrant of your mouth.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have found that there are a few minor negative things about an electric toothbrush, but the pros far outweigh the cons. I don&#x27;t like how the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t foam in my mouth anymore (which I think is due to the bristles moving so fast) because it doesn&#x27;t leave my breath as minty. I&#x27;ll probably just start using mouthwash after brushing. The water also drips down the handle while I&#x27;m brushing, which gets kind of annoying. In conclusion, though, I would totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My new toothbrush reminds me of getting my teeth cleaned professionally.  I&#x27;m assured that my teeth will be clean and that they will restore the condition of my gums. There&#x27;s no bleeding now when I brush. An excellent product.I plan on buying some of these toothbrushes for family members.</li>
    <li> Runs great and you get a nice massage for your gums as you brush</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve owned this for five years now and it is still working great.  My only issue is that the brush starts to come apart after maybe 6 months of use, and pinches your lips gums etc, forcing you to change the brush.  Probably should change it anyway, but I don&#x27;t like it when a company forces things on you this way. This is the first toothbrush I ever owned which has a brush which falls apart and hurts you like this.</li>
    <li> I you haven&#x27;t tried an electric toothbrush and have been thinking about it hurry up and get one.  your teeth will never be cleaner or healthier.  This is a very good toothbrush and the replacement heads aren&#x27;t as expensive as the other major brand.</li>
    <li> I Love my Oral B!    I switched to Sonic Care after the battery died on my old Oral B. I read the reviews on both and decided Sonic Care may be the better brush,but I wasn&#x27;t happy with it.It did not seem to clean as well and it didn&#x27;t seem to have enough torque. After giving it about a year I switched back.  They both score well, I just prefer the Oral B.</li>
    <li> The item works well enough, but is nowhere as good as the one I had previously, also from Braun. That one is still available, but costs a bit more.I am sorry that I did not buy it  The new toothbrush takes forever to charge and needs to be re-charged continuously. There is no way I could take it on even a short trip.  Also there is only one speed which is on the slow side.</li>
    <li> I love my new toothbrush.  Teeth never felt so clean.  My only disappointment was that there was no alarm to let you know when you have been brushing for two minutes.  The description of the product suggested that there was one.  Apparently the brush just pauses for a moment.  Other than that, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> It is my third toothbrush. I bought this one because the old one does not have the stop every 30 sec function. With the new one, I can control my brushing time more conveniently. It also has a light to indicate when should I recharge the toothbrush and when it has done recharging.   So far so good.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older oral B with this and so far I am very happy with the item. My mouth feels very fresh and clean. I&#x27;m sure my periodontist will like the result</li>
    <li> Product works well and is easy to use.  Service from Amazon is super as usual.</li>
    <li> Using a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; toothbrush all my life, I had a bit of adjusting getting used to this power brush.  It cleans well but bristles don&#x27;t get in between teeth.  Regular brush does a better job with this part of your cleaning.  Brush refill heads a bit pricey.  Overall, I would recommend to a friend.  Well worth the money but save your pennies for the head replacements.</li>
    <li> The item cost more than what I wanted to pay for a toothbrush, but the results and convenience of use made up for it.  It was recommended to me by my dental hygienist to cut down on the number of trips to her.</li>
    <li> The product I ordered arrived within a week. It was as expected and at a good price!</li>
    <li> I have relied on Oral-B power toothbrushes for some years after trying a few other brands, and I find them effective and reliable.  They clean thoroughly, quickly, and have a small enough brush head to get to hard-to-reach areas.  This model is even better than the last: faster brush action, more battery life between charge.  I recommend this product.  Sugar-free icing on the cake: there was also a $10 rebate on the bruch &amp; $15 rebate for a dentist visit.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush cleans well, and is easy to use.  This is my second one.  The first lasted ~9 years.  Replacement heads are a little expensive but not prohibitive.  One will last a month or more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never believed in electric toothbrushes because I remember years ago when they looked and operated like toys.  My dental hygenist strongly reccommended that and a water pic, so I relented and purchased one.  My teeth do feel cleaner after using it than they did with a regular toothbrush.  Also I have a gag reflex that is mostly eliminated by this product because the head is so small.  I do reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!  I had the old Vitality Oral-B Toothbrush, which goes for 20 bucks, and I love my new one (I paid $46.)  It is worth the extra 25 bucks bc its definitely more bulky and heavy duty of a toothbrush.  I would buy again!!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric powered toothbrush so I was not sure what to expect. It takes a lot longer than 2 minutes (around 5 minutes or more) for me to brush properly with this brush and cover all tooth surfaces. When I am done, my teeth do feel \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot;, a feeling that would require a ton more brushing with regular non-electric brushes. I don&#x27;t like the automatic indicator feature on this brush that indicates when to stop brushing a particular side and switch to the other side. The brush actually stops spinning for a second and it feels like an interruption to me.  I am almost NEVER done when the indicator comes on to give the signal for a switch.     Brushing with the electric brush is MESSY - way more messy than brushing with a regular brush. A number of other reviewers have complained about the difficult cleaning of this brush. I have no such issues. I simply take the whole brush head part off the brush base and rinse both the brush head and the metal base that holds the brush head in the water before leaving them on my bathroom counter to dry. Recharging takes an entire day but when fully charged, I can use the brush for nearly a week (once a day) before the red-light-indicator for recharging comes on.    Overall I am happy with this brush. I think the lesser features there are on electric brushes the more functional they are. This is one of the simpler brushes on the market but I wish it didn&#x27;t have the annoying timed-interruption \\&quot;feature\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have owned more expensive models of the Oral-B electric toothbrush and this works as good as any of the others.  Great Buy!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. He has a tendency to brush too hard. It was recommended by our dentist that he should use an electric one. This product works well.</li>
    <li> Had Sonicare before and was not happy with results... got a bigger Oral-B center and I felt the difference. Then I bought this as a secondary charge and for travels. It holds the power easily for a week with twice a day use without need to recharge. I like it a lot and would recommend it to anyone.  One minor caveat: do not brush middle of the night close to your partner - it is lauder than you would expect :)</li>
    <li> I recently upgraded to this toothbrush from an Oral-B Vitality that I had for 4+ years and I love the new one! I have always used electric toothbrushes, but my teeth feel much cleaner with this one than they ever did with other Oral-B brushes.    Its worth noting that this brush comes with two heads: one precision clean and one dual clean.    Oral-B is doing a 50% off rebate on their higher-end (including this one) toothbrushes through 9/15/2011. So if price is an issue, make sure to get your order in by the 15th and get a half-price toothbrush!    [....]</li>
    <li> It is a good product, I use it every day and I have not had any problems. I would definitely recommend this toothbrush.Just it need a case to protect it.</li>
    <li> I got the toothbrush on time and it works great. Brushing my teeth hasn&#x27;t ever been so easy and even fun but(yeah, there&#x27;s a but)... my dentist told me that it&#x27;s not as good as a manual toothbrush (if properly used) and COULD affect my gums ealth. Therefore, before buying one talk to your dentist.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and seems well worth the cost.  Your teeth really do feel a lot cleaner after using it, and it is very effective at cleaning the hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is awesome.  I&#x27;ve had it for 1 1/2 years not and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I got this after having a Rotodent my dentist recommended.  I got tired of paying $25 ea. for replacement brushes so I decided to try this.  It does an awesome job and has a great two minute timer; which is the amount of time recommended for tooth brushing.  My only issue - which I&#x27;ve seen no one else discuss - is how the post gets yucky unless you completely dry the toothbrush with a towel after each use.  Maybe it only happens to me??   Anyway, the refills are affordable and it does a fabulous job - nuf&#x27; said.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is so incredibly efficient and technologically intriguing, that my boyfriend helps himself to it. I will never go back to my old toothbrush. Quite an investment but worth every penny. You can do like I did and ask for it for Christmas. Thanks Dave and George.</li>
    <li> After a lot of great use, I&#x27;m ready to replace my Oral B power toothbrush with a new one -- and I&#x27;m not going to purchase this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it does a great job of cleaning teeth, the cap protecting the replacement heads broke off after just a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it takes up a lot of room and tips over quite easily, which is annoying in a busy bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also impossible to clean. This is what&#x27;s really making me choose a different type of power toothbrush. It&#x27;s just so unhygenic when toothpaste, moisture and who knows what builds up in a portion of the device that is underneath where the additional toothbrush heads rest. You have to take the device apart to try to reach it, but it takes far too much time--and sponges, Q-tips and whatever else I can squeeze in there--to try to scoop it all out and make it clean. There&#x27;s got to be a better alternative.</li>
    <li> I wanted to point out some design issues that I feel Oral B could work on for this otherwise invaluable product.  The bottom of the brush base that meets with the charger gets dirty and needs to be cleaned out, and gunk always builds up on the charger base, because the water drips down after brushing.  Maybe they can design a charger base that is not at the bottom but connected to the side?  The bottom and inside of the replacement brushes can get dirty with build-up also if you forget to wash them out with water.  This is inevitable, but the rubbery material does not help in cleaning it.  I wish it were a more cleanable surface.  The extension cord also can get messy if you have other bathroom products around.  It would be nice to have a model that sits and plugs in directly to an outlet or have a more flexible cord.  The storage chamber unit doesn&#x27;t really fit the brushes very well, and it does get pretty dirty in the bottom and is not easy to clean.  Products like these make you wonder what the designers are thinking when they use them, or if they use them at all.  But of course, it beats regular toothbrushes, and the slick feeling in your teeth after brushing is nice to have.  I&#x27;ll try Sonicare next time.</li>
    <li> Had an Oral B of some sort before this one.  It was getting kinda nasty due to the fact that I didn&#x27;t rinse the body off well after brushing.  Ordered this one as a replacement.  Been using the 2nd style heads (the ones with the extra scrubber part making it more like a normal toothbrush size) and apparently they&#x27;ve been doing thier job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting teeth cleaned at dentist took half the time it used too.  Dental hygenist asked what I was doing different and I said nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only after leaving did I remember I had picked up one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save 10-15 min of dentist torture....you decide if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> The Oral B Power tooth brush is excellent.  It holds charge great.  Teeth feel cleaner than ever.  Great purchase and a great deal.  Replaceable brush heads make this even better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an Oral-B electric toothbrush for at least 20 years.  Bought this one as a back-up just in case. The 2 I&#x27;ve had during this time were just perfect.  I like the round brush head as I have a small mouth and it gets where it needs to go without damage to the surrounding areas.  Plus I had a coupon for 50% off so it just made sense to get the back-up at this time.</li>
    <li> Been using Braun elec. toothbrushes for &gt; 15 years and I am a sort of a bigot when it comes to Braun electric toothbrushes.  This is my fourth (they do not last indefinitely!) but it&#x27;s probably what I expect for any frequently used appliance.  This seems to be improved although I find the 30 sec. interval reminder unnecessary.</li>
    <li> My dentist was pushing me to get a Sonic Care but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much. Oral B gets my teeth way cleaner than a regular brush, I only have to charge once a week (my wife and I brush 2x a day) and the brush heads last three months.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended electric tooth brush for receeding gums, so I purchased this. Have been using over a year and still going strong. Makes my teeth feel really clean!</li>
    <li> Great product. As long as you change the brushes regularly your teeth will be cleaner than with regular tooth brushes. Battery life is not long enough but other than that, it works very well.</li>
    <li> I have gone through many Oral Bs and I really do not see any difference in any of them, other than the attachments or size of base it comes with.</li>
    <li> A fantastic product. My teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally cleaned every day.&lt;br /&gt;I once thought I was diligent enough at brushing by hand, but I was wrong. A few months of using this toothbrush, and my gums are pink and healthy where they were once red and inflamed.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews first and all the positive reviews were true. I was told by my dentist to purchase a electric tooth brush and this was recommended by an employee. I love it. The two minutes go but very fast, you just want to continue brushing your teeth. You do have to get used to drooling over the sink since the stem dosen&#x27;t allow you to fully close your mouth. After a cleaning they feel GREAT! just like after visiting the dentist. I recommend this product 100%.</li>
    <li> You think your mouth is clean after brushing, and so did I.  It&#x27;s not.  It is impossible for us to brush our teeth and clean our mouth the way this toothbrush does with a regular toothbrush.  It is simple to use, and unlike many others does not contribute to receding gums.  If your gums bleed when you go to the dentist, buy this toothbrush.  If your mouth feels gross two hours after brushing, buy this toothbrush.  If you like that smooth, clean feeling after visiting the dentist but don&#x27;t enjoy the scraping, picking and cold sweats that go along with the dentist buy this toothbrush.  You will have that wonderful feeling twice a day and when you visit the dentist there will be no plaque, tartar or anything else for the dentist or his hygenist.  The best 50 bucks you can spend on yourself.  This is my third ORALB plaque remover and by far the best.</li>
    <li> With the fabulous &amp;quot;aging gums&amp;quot; of my generation, decided to try this on recommendation of a dentist friend... FABULOUS... works great, and bought one for our children to use as well!!</li>
    <li> Yes, it is true, I haven&#x27;t had this clean feeling in my mouth since my last visit to the dentist. The Oral-B is made in Germany and is a joy to use.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only problem is with this description from Amazon: 3 Flexisoft brush heads, 1 PowerTip brush head and brush head Storage Tower included. Do you see the number three (3)? And the number one (1)?  That makes 3 + 1 &#x3D; 4. Right? Not true at all, my toothbrush has two (2) brush heads. So, caveat emptor, Amazon, FOR SHAME, for false advertising.  Maybe that is why it was a Gold Box item. Speaking of which; where is the Gold Box anyway??? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Buy the brush, you&#x27;ll enjoy it and your mouth will be much healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for several years now and I could not be more pleased. I&#x27;m not going to go into details about all the things everyone else has already said, but I do have a fantastic tip to share.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lay down on the bed while brushing! Brushing at the sink for 2 or 3 minutes seems like an eternity (especially if you are one of those people who often gets the toothpaste drooling down your chin). Laying down while brushing is one of the best ideas I have ever had. Try this for at least a week and you will be hooked!  Relax. Let the toothbrush do the work while you lay down and relax. Enjoy the feeling of the toothbrush massaging your gums and cleaning your teeth. Take your time, and RELAX! (I know, I keep saying relax over and over, but seriously, try taking a little meditation and relaxation break). This makes a mundane chore actually quite enjoyable.  If you do this, you will find that you brush longer, and you AND your dentist will notice the results. WARNING! Wait until you get back to the sink to brush your tongue so you don&#x27;t gag or choke. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By the way, I also have a Sonicare and use it on a regular basis but I prefer this one because it&#x27;s more controllable.</li>
    <li> I owned an electric toothbrush briefly while I had braces a few years ago.  It was terrible.  I don&#x27;t even know what brand it was but I think I gave it to Goodwill.  In the last year or so, my orthodontist and hygienist have told me to get another one.  I finally did January 1.  I wanted the Braun Oral-B 3D Excel Pulsating Toothbrush but got this one instead.  They seemed about the same.  I was apprehensive at first.  I let it charge for 16 hours (as the manual said) and used it the next day.  It&#x27;s scary how much it vibrates. It seems like it would damage your teeth or gums! But it&#x27;s so neat though! I hope it helps.  I have a problem with plaque and gum recession (I&#x27;m only 24!!!).  But when I had braces I brushed really hard not knowing the damage it would do to my gums.  Now I know, so I guess that&#x27;s all that matters.  I feel some tartar on my teeth after using this thing but I think that is because I was worried I&#x27;d hurt something in there! As I get used to it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be much better.  I spent $63 on this, so it better work! Already, I like it better than regular brushing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this item 5 stars, though I do agree with what a previous reviewer said - it does get sloppy near the base of the charger. You have to keep on top of that if you don&#x27;t want paste buildup there. For me the buildup has never affected charging. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, the list of positives is strong. I had a previous model of Oral B electric and this one is cheaper and even better. It works like a charm. A nice feature is that it lets you know when you&#x27;ve been brushing for 2 minutes. That may sound silly to some people but most people do not brush long enough. A scrub here and a scrub there and they think they&#x27;re done because their mouth tastes minty. This gets your teeth CLEAN. After I had this brush for a few months I had a dentist visit. He asked me if I had gotten my teeth whitened! (I hadn&#x27;t and I don&#x27;t use any special toothpaste. I just brush with this for the two minutes.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product is excellent and really works well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By the way, I still have the other Oral B I mentioned and it still works, after about 8 years.</li>
    <li> This product cleans teeth really well along with flossing of course. Really makes brushing easy (no more brushing too hard or too soft). After you use this product you feel a difference as compared using just a manual toothbrush. The timer is another great feature because now you can exactly time how long you should brush your teeth for    Health and Happiness,    Patrick Leonardi</li>
    <li> Keeps my purly whites clean &amp; bright!</li>
    <li> The electric toothbrush has too much vibration for my comfort.  It is almost as bad as the sonic ones.  I feel like my fillings will fall out.  I will see how good a job it does at my next cleaning.</li>
    <li> Oral-B is always a good choice for a toothbrush. The battery went bad on our last one after 3 years, so we are hoping this one lasts a bit longer.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush with a lot of power. I am glad I got this item - really good quality and the heads are even available at BJ&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has saved my gums and prevented many cavities.&lt;br /&gt;Since I use this toothbrush I have much less inflammation of the gums and I only got 1 cavity (while I used to have more frequently). It does a great job and holds the charge well (I went on a 3-week trip on 1 charge).&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend replacing the default toothbrush head provided (small circle) to the dual clean head. Why limit yourself to a small work surface when the toothbrush could brush double?</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily for 3-4 years, and the battery seems to be as good as when I started.</li>
