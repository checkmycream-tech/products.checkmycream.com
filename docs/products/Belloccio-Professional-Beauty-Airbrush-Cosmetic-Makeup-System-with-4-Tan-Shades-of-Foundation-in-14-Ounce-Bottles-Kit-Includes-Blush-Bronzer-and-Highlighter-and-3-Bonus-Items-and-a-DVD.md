      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I bought this after watching tv comercial and thought this would be great for my daughter since she does dance competitions, thought it would make it much easier for her to put on foundation, but</li>
      <li>I love what I read and the comments.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, I prefer the foundation from luminess air.</li>
      <li>The Belloccio&#x27;s  product work&#x27;s very effective and also give you a long lasting flawless look good for stage makeup.</li>
      <li>Belloccio&#x27;s makeup looks and feel so natural and blends great with my complexion.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s easy to operate and feels like feather on you face.  </li>

      <li>The makeup is so light that you get practically no coverage.</li>

      <li>Don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s better than competing air makeup systems.</li>
      <li>so you&#x27;ll have to go over the skin about 3-4 times to get full coverage.</li>
      <li>Love My New Airbrush System!</li>
      <li>I was shipped fast and system is easy to use.</li>
      <li>and if the color is right.</li>
      <li>It takes some playing around to find the right foundation</li>
      <li>Application is very light and requires extra layering.  </li>
      <li>But am an older woman who has worn mineral make-up for many years because of oily and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this with, and am using it for the first time.</li>
      <li>I love it, but I need to send it back and get it replaced bc</li>
      <li>its my first time using airbrush system ..</li>
      <li>The first day I wore it</li>
      <li>Belloccio&#x27;s may not be a household name or come in a fancy box, but it so much better then the big named brand.  </li>
      <li>I tried Belloccio yesterday for the first time.</li>
      <li>I did exactly as the instruction stated and used the primer and then the foundation.</li>
      <li>The kit included directions for an exact match</li>
      <li>it makes a really loud shoooshing sound</li>
      <li>Just make sure you only use their brand of makeup.</li>
      <li>Came Super Fast &amp; was wrapped very well.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and a \\&quot;T\\&quot; oily zone and the make looked fresh all evening</li>
      <li>I am very picky when it comes to makeup.  </li>
      <li>I really like this system.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The instructions that did come with it were very vague.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very sturdy construction.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s pretty loud - about a 6 on a scale from 1-10.</li>
      <li>I want it replaced With new one.</li>
      <li>I need a new one.</li>
      <li>I tried it ...and it does looks natural</li>
      <li>brand that left me looking orange even after trying the light and dark shades</li>
      <li>I had a little issue with the machine not turning off but when I contacted the company they send me a new one right away</li>
      <li>I also discovered that you have to let the makeup set for a few minutes after application to see the full effect</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll receive product at .75 oz - nowhere near as big as the picture</li>
      <li>so far only tried it once to find my color &amp; Get a fill of it.</li>
      <li>It takes a little longer to apply, but it appears to be something I&#x27;m really going to like.</li>

<li> and you have the airbrush in the little holder</li>

<li> 2 months in, uses it at least 3 times a week and loves it!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love it, but I need to send it back and get it replaced bc it stopped spraying product and I&#x27;ve cleaned it and everything. I want it replaced With new one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to operate and feels like feather on you face.  Love the fact that it stays on fresh all day.  The bag for it is neat and everything stores perfect in it.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this system from Amazon after reading the reviews about Belloccio. What grabbed my attention was the 30 day money back guarantee. This was important to me because I ordered another well advertised system that begins with an \\&quot;L\\&quot; -- not through Amazon -- that refused to honor the 30-day guarantee and would not allow a return. I tried Belloccio yesterday for the first time. I did exactly as the instruction stated and used the primer and then the foundation. The kit included directions for an exact match and I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to apply. As I was going out for the evening, I applied another thin coat and added the shimmer. I was also impressed with how easily the make was removed. I have very sensitive skin and a \\&quot;T\\&quot; oily zone and the make looked fresh all evening and my skin was not irritated.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas.  She hasn&#x27;t stopped thanking me for it!!!  2 months in, uses it at least 3 times a week and loves it!  Still going on the batch of makeup that comes with the kit.  Very sturdy construction.</li>
    <li> its my first time using airbrush system ..I tried it ...and it does looks natural the make up is good the only thing I disagree with is the five drops they said u need is nt like tht ..the five drops does nt do entire face it runs out very quick ..but it is a lovely product ...great price</li>
    <li> I love what I read and the comments.  I will write a review after I order and use your product.  Looks like a lot of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ro</li>
    <li> The Belloccio&#x27;s  product work&#x27;s very effective and also give you a long lasting flawless look good for stage makeup.</li>
    <li> Works as promised. The first day I wore it I got nothing by compliments on my makeup and people asking me if I switched foundations.</li>
    <li> I just received mine in the mail today. Sort of concerned about the gun because it doesn&#x27;t always spray, already. Foundation VERY light so you&#x27;ll have to go over the skin about 3-4 times to get full coverage. I LOVE the shimmer blush that comes with it. Compressor sounds like a vibrating phone on a wooden table so it&#x27;s pretty loud - about a 6 on a scale from 1-10. You&#x27;ll receive product at .75 oz - nowhere near as big as the picture but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love love this product the makeup is amazing and light feels like I&#x27;m not wearing anything even though my redness and dark spots vanish. I had a little issue with the machine not turning off but when I contacted the company they send me a new one right away and I didn&#x27;t even have to pay shipping or anything! Wonderful customer service.</li>
    <li> After using it for a week the machine broke so I couldn&#x27;t control the air volume it wouldn&#x27;t turn off I would have to unplug it in order for it to do so and the makeup would spill out I had to send it back not worth the money.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT- works great!! :) Definitely Recommend! Sprays on so easy and makes your face look flawless. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup!  Just make sure you only use their brand of makeup.</li>
    <li> I was shipped fast and system is easy to use. I bought it for my girlfriend and she just loved it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after a long time wanting to try out air brushing. The makeup is so light that you get practically no coverage. I was very disappointed so I returned it. I must admit that there was no problems with getting the refund hence the 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Did not include a tutorial, had to go on-line and find another Air-Brush system that did give a tutorial to learn how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions that did come with it were very vague.&lt;br /&gt;Advertised that it would fill in all the wrinkles but it did not.</li>
    <li> This has been a great addition for me.  I&#x27;m ordering one as a gift for my sister for mother&#x27;s day.  Its lightweight, yet amazing coverage.  It definitely gives the &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look all day.  Skin looks and feels healthy.  My only complaint is the first one I received was defective.  The compressor wouldnt change speeds and the airbrush would blow out in blotches.  However, it was immediately replaced and works wonders.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product. The foundation itself is thin. I prefer a softer mineral make up look. Doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes well like advertised</li>
    <li> pros: works fine&lt;br /&gt;cons: too noisy compared to other airbrush systems. Also when it&#x27;s it the On position and you have the airbrush in the little holder it makes a really loud shoooshing sound it always scares my cat (the loud noise is do to the air being trapped in the holder &amp; no where to go). The manufactures should&#x27;ve put the airbrush holder on the outside allowing the air flow to come out so it won&#x27;t make the loud noise (that is how other systems are)</li>
    <li> This is the best thing that ever happen to me in makeup,time saving just beautiful makes me feel years younger.</li>
    <li> I have used it two times, and love it. It looks great on.</li>
    <li> I really like this system. It takes some playing around to find the right foundation and if you spray too close it clumps. Love the way my face looks and it is faster in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love it, but the tan color I can&#x27;t  use the dropper on the makup,. I need a new one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, I prefer the foundation from luminess air. I find that the Belloccio&#x27;s foundation does not give that glow and dewyness. But nothing a little bronzer won&#x27;t fix. It&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this with, and am using it for the first time. But am an older woman who has worn mineral make-up for many years because of oily and sensitive skin. Mineral powders do tend to be chalky and heavier. Air brushing is a lighter application technique and has to be put on in layers. I was able to get the coverage I needed after about three layers. I also discovered that you have to let the makeup set for a few minutes after application to see the full effect and if the color is right. It was pleasant and fun to use. It takes a little longer to apply, but it appears to be something I&#x27;m really going to like. It gives a more youthful glow without looking oily. Feels good on the skin. Very pretty shades in the tan foundations which were perfect for my skin tone. It was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up was pretty easy, too. The air brush itself is nice equipment. Will update my review after wearing for a few weeks to see how it works out. Don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s better than competing air makeup systems.</li>
    <li> I am very picky when it comes to makeup.  The quality of this product, both the airbrush system and the makeup are of top quality.  The bag that came with it is really nice, as well.  The tanning solution gives a very nice looking tan, not fake.  The makeup covers well, and the colors sent are wonderful...a perfect match for my fair-skinned daughter and for me with tan skin!  I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Belloccio&#x27;s may not be a household name or come in a fancy box, but it so much better then the big named brand.  I tried Bolloccio after the well know &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; brand that left me looking orange even after trying the light and dark shades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Belloccio&#x27;s makeup looks and feel so natural and blends great with my complexion.  I did have to call customer support for a replacement compressor but the customer service was great I called on a Friday and had my replacement by Monday. I will continue to do business with this company.</li>
    <li> DONT BUY!!! Broke after one use and its horrible. Temptu is better</li>
    <li> it is awesome it is really smooth, and it look so natural.</li>
    <li> Love My New Airbrush System! It works well so far only tried it once to find my color &amp; Get a fill of it. Came Super Fast &amp; was wrapped very well.</li>
    <li> This product is dis-similar to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; make-up and takes some time to get used to.  Application is very light and requires extra layering.  I think it will work just fine but I will need time to adjust to it.</li>
    <li> I bought this after watching tv comercial and thought this would be great for my daughter since she does dance competitions, thought it would make it much easier for her to put on foundation, but what happend is it was splotchy did not cover evenly on face and it looked caked on.</li>
