<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great, not greasy, and no sunburn!</li>
    <li> was really good bought has a gift and totally was what she wanted they are now chain to use this as there moisturiser</li>
    <li> I saw this moisturizer in a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; store and it was priced out of my beauty budget range so I looked for it on Amazon and liked how it was priced. I like this moisturizer, it is light and glides on nice and smooth...I think I may even notice a sense of my skin looking a bit more even...I am still new to this product line and will continue to use it..</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and it was in good condition when I got it. I can&#x27;t rave enough about how much I love this face lotion! It&#x27;s light and it sinks in quickly, leaving you without any build up within seconds. Protects daily against the sun. Great!</li>
    <li> I love Alba Botanica products. This is a little light for me; I have dry skin in the winter and need a little extra moisture. I think this will be just right during the warmer months, and that SPF 15 will come in handy!</li>
    <li> Hello! I absolutley love this product! I have oily skin, which some of you may know, that sunscreen doesnt go too well with oily skin. However this product has not given me any more oil, and has hydrated my skin immensely! I use this along with the matching cleanser. Little goes a long way, great buy.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps,&lt;br /&gt;Brentt</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer with an spf I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s very moisturizing for my sensitive, dry skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty film like other moisturizers with spf tend to do. Great price, too.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and live in socal, so I need the sun block.  This is the only face cream I use daily.  I love it.</li>
    <li> moisturizes the combination skin on my face without ill effects</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer for sun protection. I live in Arizona so I need to have a daily SPF face lotion. What I like about this one and I why I use it is because it gives me adequate sun protection and is soft and creamy when it goes on, feels like whipped cream. It is light but a bit thicker than other Alba moisturizers. I put the Alba Hawaiian green tea and aloe moisturizer on first to hydrate and balance my combination oily skin, and add the daily SPF lotion to my nose and cheeks and forehead especially when I know I will be outside for several hours. For someone who has very fair skin though, SPF 15 is not probably adequate, so they will probably need to try a different moisturizer with at least SPF 30 or higher.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff.  Light, not greasy and provides good sun protection.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it really keeps your face hydrated without feeling heavy and a little goes a long way! Though because the formula is so light it tends to be a bit liquidly when you&#x27;re squeezing it out of the tube so I would be careful to squeeze it with the tip facing up</li>
    <li> I use this every day. It&#x27;s a nice light texture and doesn&#x27;t clump up my makeup. Love the SPF!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Smells great, goes on like silk.</li>
    <li> This cream is very moisturizing but feels kind of greasy for me. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again because I haven&#x27;t noticed and special changes in my skin.</li>
    <li> Wow, never thought I would purchase anything else but Origins and this product proved me otherwise.  So far it has moisturized my face very well during the day (I have dry skin and sometimes flaky on my forehead, chin area and lightly on my cheeks during the winter season in the east coast).  You would have to try it since everyone&#x27;s face will respond to it differently and depending on what season and where you are residing will also make a difference.  This is my first time being in the east coast during the winter season so my face is a lot more dehydrated (it has not yet acclimated to the east coast winter weather, if it will ever be) in any case this product has done it&#x27;s job and I have been very happy of it.</li>
    <li> love the alba line! I originally bought this at whole foods but now I will only get here on Amazon because the price is much better. This face cream smells soooooo good and is totally natural. It&#x27;s extra creamy &amp; moisturizing - a little goes a long way- and it has SPF to protect from sun damage. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> Nice, light moisturizer with a subtle scent. I use the Even Advanced toner and really like how it gently &amp; thoroughly cleans my skin. I don&#x27;t love the moisturizer as much as the toner, but it&#x27;s a good product. I&#x27;m in search of a moisturizer that gives me a glow vs makes me feel &amp; look slightly oily. Might just not be a match for my skin.</li>
    <li> The best thing for my face</li>
    <li> My lady got me to start using this product and it&#x27;s done the job. I usually don&#x27;t go for creams and fanciness, but this is a simple clean product that keeps my face looking and feeling great. I approve, Miss Alba.</li>
    <li> Not a fan. I&#x27;ve been using this because I want to protect myself from the sun daily. It&#x27;s made my face semi greasy, and it also dries it out, not to mention, more breakouts since starting this stuff. I LOVE Alba Botanica products; this is the first I&#x27;ve tried that I dislike. I would go a different route if looking for a moisturizer with SPF.</li>
    <li> great product that I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
    <li> Too bad it does not have the ingredients to protect you from the range of damaging UVA rays. It is otherwise a good lotion in terms of application and smell. I ended up using it as a night time lotion.</li>
    <li> I keep trying other natural moisturizers that are less expensive and keep coming back to Alba.  This stuff applies easily, is not greasy at all, and it comes in a size that makes it ok to take as is through airport security.</li>
    <li> Product seems watered down from what I usually buy.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this moisturizer because of the good reviews. The texture is thin and runny so I don&#x27;t think I will buy this item again.</li>
    <li> I love how my skin feels after using this product.  I also use the Alba Sea Mineral Cleansing Gel and Alba Sea Kelp Facial Toner.</li>
    <li> Been using this cream for sometime now. Love the consistency of it and love the fact that it contains spf for everyday use. The fragrance is a tiny bit strong, but not over the top. It absorbs well and does not leave your face feeling greasy at all. Will continue to use and hope to see some of the color inconsistency fade on my face. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - SPF, great moisture, use in winter and summer.  Perfect size, smells great, not too greasy, great price.</li>
    <li> I used to always use a moisturiser by Avon that contained sea minerals, but then they discontinued it, so I was really glad to discover this moisturiser and it&#x27;s a bonus that it has SPF so I know my face is protected. I also like the fact that it is natural. It smells amazing, sinks in nicely and leaves my skin velvety soft. It also wears well under make-up. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great product that I can&#x27;t find in stores anymore... Light and non irritating for my sensitive skin and great for summer moisturizing</li>
    <li> I just love Alba products. I originally starting using their Lavender SPF 45 for my body and was curious for some moisturizer for my face. This is excellent. My skin is dry but this does not leave a film or feel sticky or greasy. I love it. I even use it on my eyelids and it doesn&#x27;t melt into my eyes.</li>
    <li> My go to face moisturizer for years now. Not greasy and has SPF in it. Great product!!! (I have combination skin and works great for me - no grease at the end of the day, but enough moisture to keep my skin from feeling dry)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched SPF moisturizers and am so very pleasantly pleased with this purchase.  It fits all my requirements, does the job quite well, and is within budget.</li>
    <li> It made my skin red and cause some skin problem as well. It should indicate some warning of this I guess, since I bought this because they said it is artificial free and mild.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for my old moisturizer but without the parabens, chemicals, etc. Smells great, goes on smooth, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face with pimples or greasy. I don&#x27;t even miss my old moisturizer…</li>
    <li> Not greasy, and it smells great. Does a good job as a light sunscreen. Great product for every day use.</li>
    <li> I got this moisturizer, because I had bad acne that left a lot of scars, and dark marks on my face. I used it consistently twice a day after washing my face, but it had not effect on lightening or clearing my hyperpigmentation. On the bright side it didn&#x27;t make me break out. I think their Sea Plus Renewal Night Cream is much better at brightening the face and clearing dark marks. I saw visible results with the night cream. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a friend, its just like any other moisturizer.</li>
    <li> No phthalates, etc. Recommended at a health food store years ago and have used it ever since. Nothing alarming in the list of ingredients, absorbs quickly as a makeup base.</li>
    <li> Love these products.  I use the whole line, along with Alba&#x27;s Hawaiian line.  My face never breaks out, and the botanicals they use are all excellent and natural.  I am over 60, and get a lot of comments about how great my skin looks.</li>
    <li> Has a pleasant smell that is not overwhelming. The consistency is very smooth and soft of the skin. Highly recommend and worth price</li>
    <li> Great facial moisturizer with SPF and no sulfates or parabens . It is a bit oily and shiny but not too noticeable. Lasts all day and doses not clog the skin.</li>
    <li> Product is fantastic.  It provides the perfect amount of moisture without greasing up your skin.  Best thing, it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
    <li> I used to use this entire line, and it&#x27;s like a cruelty-free, vegan ProActive, perfect for my oily teen skin!</li>
    <li> This quality face cream has SPF 15, is not tested on animals. I have used this product for years. I have sensitive skin and this moisturizer is a good product for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts, this cream does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to redness and dryness. I&#x27;ve been using this as part of a skin care regime and so far it seems to be helping. It has a very light smell to it but its pleasant. Very light to wear and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sold, as it felt kind of oily on my face. BUT I had just had a baby, and as any woman who has had that experience knows, that can wreak havoc with your face. So I stuck with it because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was me or the lotion. Also, I really didn&#x27;t want to waste a whole bottle.I&#x27;m glad I did!  I use it daily and it isn&#x27;t too oily and it feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing well, unlike some natural moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried. I have a normal t-zone area and super dry cheeks and this works well for me. It smells nice, too. I will reorder it.</li>
    <li> I think this product has similar ingredients to Le Mer. It works very well and is very affordable. I had to use a Clinique moisturizer while I was waiting for my Alba Even to arrive. I could notice a difference in my skin for the worse. I&#x27;m not knocking Clinique as most of my makeup is from that brand.</li>
    <li> I have used Alba Botanica off and on for over 30 years. I am back using it again. I love this product</li>
    <li> Lovely, lovely, lovely, I am loving this product, it very soft, and smooth on my face, this is the very best moisturizer I ever purchase, and the good thing about this product it have SPF protection , which I love , I have being using this for six months now, and in have to say ...yea....I finally purchase a moisturizer that&#x27;s not only say what it say it does, but definitely does what is said. I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 years now and love it.  It had never created a breakout and still provides some sun protection on an everyday basis.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product as well as the manufacturer. I wear this moisturizer under my makeup foundation as it&#x27;s non-greasy and very breathable. I use its counterpart, the night cream before bed. I have noticed that my complexion has improved after using these two products religiously. I know that moisturizing is an important part of a daily regimen, so I think this product would make an excellent addition to anyone&#x27;s beauty regimen. It also helps that it contains SPF!</li>
    <li> This product smells fabulous but leaves my skin feeling greasy.  I do love the fact that it includes SPF, but I think that contributes to the greasy like feeling. Though it doesn&#x27;t have SPF, I&#x27;ve found that the daily cream works better than the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is an ok product that I tried for summer.  I don&#x27;t know why any sunscreen product has less than 30 SPF since 15 does almost nothing for you.  It does work as a thin moisturizer under heavier sunscreen for outdoor activities.  Again, it is super thin so be careful when squeezing the product out or you could have a disaster.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and need a good SPF for outdoors, this one is my favorite by far.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent skin product for sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t use store-bought moisturizers because of the ingredients tend to leave my skin oily and cause breakout. This is a great lotion. Non-oily plus it has SPF 15 which is great for the skin. I have used other lotions with SPF in them and they burned my skin. This is a great product! And it last a while so definitley worth the price.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells good, goes on light and moisturizes my skin nicely.  My skin is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; - not oily or dry, maybe more dry than oily.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect day time lotion because it is lightweight and has SPF 30. I personally have oily skin and  I find that this is one of the only lotions with SPF that I don&#x27;t break out with.</li>
    <li> Did it&#x27;s job. Can be a little on the greasy side in the summer, less is more.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ever believe that anything Alba is natural. It may be a step in the right direction but I have found that everything Alba dries up my skin and hair. I was originally stoked to find Alba because it&#x27;s cheap for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; stuff. But it&#x27;s no good. For an inexpensive lotion that&#x27;s good for sensitive and acne prone skin I would highly recommend the &amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; brand. It&#x27;s not 100% natural either but it is very non-irritating and doesn&#x27;t dry you up. If you need a lot of moisture however, it may not be heavy enough. Simple is better for people who already have a pretty good amount of oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy who gets really itchy dry skin during the winter and my face wash doesn&#x27;t help. I use this lotion after I wash my face and shave and it seems to restore a lot of the moisture that&#x27;s lost. My family has a history of skin cancer, so it&#x27;s nice that this has SPF 15. All in all I highly recommend this product, but the price is hard to handle for such a small tube. However, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is my second order.  I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels and smells. I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat buyer. So glad to know I can finally use a delightful product that wasn&#x27;t tested on animals. I&#x27;m very pleased :D</li>
    <li> Smells great, applys nicely and absorbs into skin well.</li>
    <li> Used this for over a year and haven&#x27;t had any breakouts. It has enough moisturizer so my skin is not dry and the SPF is built in!!! So, I don&#x27;t have to put multiple things on my skin to protect and hydrate. Bonus! Its natural!</li>
    <li> light and creamy but not runny. smells great and it has spf! a little pricey, but its organic so its worth it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to switch to products that have less chemicals. As a whole, I like the Alba line, but I didn&#x27;t care much for this moisturizer. The scent seemed nice in the test bottle, but on my face, it is quite strong. I didn&#x27;t expect it to smell as strong as it did based off the test bottle, but it does. And, it lingers. It stays with you for hours... I smell it practically all day. My second issue with this moisturizer is that it caused me to break out a bit. I definitely noticed a difference. I have combination skin and can be prone to acne anyway, but this exacerbated the problem. I think it&#x27;s got the right balance of lightweight, but still moisturizes enough, but I didn&#x27;t like scent or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to using the Alba Jasmine and Vitamin E moisturizer, and I really love that. Great smell, no breakouts, and it is a nice thick moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy on your face. I much prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different people have different skin reactions though, it&#x27;s such a personal thing. Just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> After ordering this I received the \\&quot;Alba Even Advanced,\\&quot; so I assume this is the updated version. While the old one smelled like something crawled out of the sea and died on your face, this one smells like a bordello died on your face. I was willing to overcome the old smell since this product is wonderfully moisturizing and the smell dissipated rather quickly, but I don&#x27;t know if I can smell like a cheap hooker all day...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and I have no complaints. I look for moisturizers with SPF and is cruelty-free. Most SPF moisturizers feel heavy and greasy. This one doesn&#x27;t. Some reviews have mentioned a smell, and I was concerned about it as well since I am pretty sensitive to smells (I really dislike perfumes and colognes.) Anyway, I started to use it and for the first few days, I completely didn&#x27;t noticed the smell. Then, I did noticed it and remembered the reviews that I read, but it was no concern for me by then. It obviously wasn&#x27;t strong enough to bother me. I started noticing the smell when I apply it on my face now, but within a few minutes, it is gone; I don&#x27;t smell it anymore. So far, I really like it, because it is cruelty-free (a requirement for me and should be for everyone who loves animals - we don&#x27;t need animal testing on beauty products), has SPF, and moisturizes and is non-greasy.</li>
    <li> Use on my chin and tip of my nose only. Hours after I apply this sunscreen if I rub my face or it gets near my eyes, it burns horribly.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this was a great moisturizer with SPF. Were lightweight. It is also animal friendly as they do not test on animals</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good moisturizer that has SPF, but this one feels primarily like a sunscreen rather than a moisturizer, and leaves my skin feel a bit more oily than I&#x27;d like</li>
    <li> All natural, smells awesome, and its part of a whole sweet line of products. Its not heavy or greasy, and it protects your skin from UV rays. I wear it any normal day I go outside, even in the winter, but if you plan on being exposed to the hot sun for a while, you should probably wear something with a higher spf.</li>
    <li> i have been using it since 2006 and have always loved how it feels on my skin. during my pregnancies i could use nothing else but this product. it has been gentle and calming.</li>
    <li> Keeps my face from drying out, doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out, and the sunblock worked well enough to prevent me from burning on a two week trip to Hawaii.  Win.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin moist without it being sticky!</li>
    <li> I only used it two times.. this lotion was perfumed a LOT..  Not bad smell but too strong! I was able to smell it all day and I got headache !</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer--it smells great, feels great, and has sun protection. I was looking for something fairly light and good on sensitive skin (I have eczema and hive outbreaks, periodically) and this definitely works wonders for me. I also love the fact that it&#x27;s made by Alba, a vegetarian and environmentally friendly company. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a daytime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I do not know. I think I just do not like the feel of this product on my face. I have worn it a couple of times and can not get use to it.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but I only used it once because the scent was so overpowering. The formula wasn&#x27;t too greasy and would have been fine but the strong scent gave me a headache. I won&#x27;t be buying moisturizer online again because it is non-returnable.</li>
    <li> The first tube was purchased in December 2010. The second tube was purchased in January 2013. Two and a half years later, I am still working on the first bottle. Suffice it to say, a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer itself is good. I have sensitive skin and other products I tried were either too harsh or to thick causing adverse reactions to my skin. The Alba Sea Moss Moisturizer works well with my sensitive skin and provides the necessary SPF against sun damage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Alba See Moss Moisturizer daily religiously for over a year - no problems and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I apply after morning wash, before applying foundation. I don&#x27;t use the coordinating wash all the time. Most of Alba&#x27;s products have impressed me for the price, this line is formulated especially for malasma, which is what drew me to it in the first place. I use the Alba Sea Moss night cream also with a hyaluronic acid gel from Reviva Labs to help with tone and discoloration. My skin looks great and I always get compliments on how nice my skin looks. Definitely recommend for women who are 35+ and have skin discoloration from too much sun or hormonal changes. So until this causes problems or Alba discontinues it, I&#x27;ll keep doing what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes very well all day without leaving an oily feel or look.  Has a pleasant aroma.  I with they had it a non-SPF version.</li>
    <li> This cream meets its description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smell good and is feels good when it touches the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some dry skin issues, that&#x27;s why I bought this and it works for me, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying a couple of different moisturizers because I don&#x27;t really see a difference in my skin with Cerave.  This one smells nice, has a sunscreen and is not too heavy. If anything, it might be too light for those of us who experience various skin conditions in the winter.  Good for the price.</li>
    <li> I love Alba products!</li>
    <li> Have to say at first use I am not too happy with this product.  Read many reviews raving about the nice smell...well all I smell is sunscreen.  Hopefully I can get past that because it does seem to have a nice consistency.</li>
    <li> My sensitive skin does very well with this product.</li>
    <li> I love the rest of this alba line but this lotion broke me out unfortunately. I have adult combo skin and love the cream version for at night but this during the day just left me greasy and broken out. Perhaps its the spf? Because this came with two bottles, I am using it on my body to use it up and its pretty nice for that, just expensive to use face lotion on your legs!</li>
    <li> Smells lovely but it is a bit too watery which makes me question the quality.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and acne prone. I beak out with Every thing. This product however, didn&#x27;t cause any new breakouts and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I just wish it didn&#x27;t have any fragrance. The smell is the reason why I didn&#x27;t rate this product 5 stars. Alba brand please take the scent out and keep every thing else the same! :)</li>
    <li> it smells nasty. And it seems like it had been opened and used. no saftey wrap on it.</li>
    <li> too much fragrance  for me!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely loving this moisturizer! I wanted to find a natural moisturizer to replace my Olay one but I wanted one that was affordable and did a great job. This has been wonderful! Absolutely love the fresh smell, and this product moisturizes incredibly well without making my face look greasy/oily. The sunscreen part of it was a must for a day moisturizer, and I can attest that this moisturizer&#x27;s sunscreen qualities really holds up. My skin looks great and stays nice and balanced with this, with or without makeup. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Despite being more or less middle-aged, I&#x27;ve still got skin that, left to its own devices, breaks out in some areas and dries out in others.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of potions, including some very expensive high end ones, to find something that doesn&#x27;t exasperate either condition. This moisturizer in the Alba Even Advanced line works for me better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It is light, but still leaves my skin feeling healthy and nicely hydrated. It doesn&#x27;t have much scent but the scent there is is very light and fresh and noticeable only while you are applying it.  Is it a miracle worker? I don&#x27;t know, but I do know that my skin is more even toned and definitely has more elasticity than when I don&#x27;t use it. All without making my face feel like an oil slick on even the most humid days. I apply this with a light hand, and one tube of this stuff has lasted me several months. I haven&#x27;t done an exhaustive search off of Amazon, but do know it&#x27;s less expansive here than in most of the stores I&#x27;ve seen it in.</li>
    <li> It is a great moisturizer. very light and does not give your face oily looks. I like all alba products.</li>
    <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin, so I only wore sunscreen very seldom because frequent use made my skin breakout (no matter if it was &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; or not).&lt;br /&gt;So, I only wore sunscreen when it was absolutely essential and tried to wear a hat to make up for a lack of protection. Now in my mid twenties, I started to notice a spot on my forehead, so I realized I needed to use something!&lt;br /&gt;I gave Alba a whirl and it&#x27;s great! I haven&#x27;t had a break out, it&#x27;s oil free, has a light fragrance, it&#x27;s all natural, and it&#x27;s not animal tested. And since using it, I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in my skin! Not only is the spot gone on my forehead but my complexion has never looked better! I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Other reviews say the smell is strong, but I didn&#x27;t find it unpleasant &amp; it&#x27;s only strong for the first few minutes &amp; then disappates.  Wears well under makeup, though I do find it a little more on the greasy side than I would like.</li>
    <li> My regular daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a couple weeks now and I love it! It really evens out the texture and tone of my skin. I recommend trying it!</li>
    <li> I love the feel on my face and the subtle aroma!  I use it everyday :-)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I love this product until I tried a new one that left my face really greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect go-to daytime moisturizer. It has SPF, it&#x27;s not too light nor too heavy. It blends in well and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest bonus is its price and the fact that it&#x27;s paraben-free.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s lotion and SPF 2 in 1. Awesome</li>
    <li> Not sure why everything needs to be so perfumed these days.  I would especially expect a product advertised as &#x27;natural&#x27; to be just that, natural w/o perfumes.  Not the case.  I won&#x27;t buy it again just because of that factor.</li>
    <li> Light, airy lotion with very little fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this moisturizer - it leaves my skin feeling great, protected from the sun and smells good to boot!</li>
    <li> I like the creamy texture of this moisturizer as well as the light pleasant smell.  I try to use SPF products so this is perfect especially with the upcoming Summer season.</li>
