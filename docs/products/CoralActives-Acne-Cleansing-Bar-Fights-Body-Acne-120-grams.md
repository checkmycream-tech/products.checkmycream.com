### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I continue the fight for clearer skin and wish all others the best...</li>
      <li>This is a great cleanser - no smell which is great!</li>
      <li>This works just as good as Panoxyl bar for a great price!  </li>
      <li>Blackheads and oily skin have greatly diminish.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative.</li>
      <li>The effectiveness is just as good though.  </li>
      <li>Good for cleaning face.</li>
      <li>This product does a good job of controlling my his  breakouts.</li>
      <li>have switched to this product for good.</li>
      <li>actually a good amount of improvement.  </li>
      <li>This bar is a good alternative to the panoxyl bar.  </li>
      <li>I will buy more when I am out!</li>
      <li>Not as amazing as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>Pan Oxyl leaves a nice feeling on the face.</li>
      <li>Nice packaging as well - honest size box and plastic wrapped bar.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a very good soap, it help treat acne very fast and leave the skin non-oily.</li>
      <li>I found this bar to be refreshing and really good at cleaning my skin, so I continue to use it  (which is completely safe) regardless of whether or not I have a (temporary) skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>great product exactly like panoxyl that the doctor prescribed.</li>
      <li>it does not preform as good as  an acne soap the smell is srtong and its does not make the oily skin clean its more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the switch.</li>
      <li>and I feel it cleaning and drying my skin better.  </li>
      <li>When I couldn&#x27;t get Panoxyl, I thought this would be better than nothing, but ...</li>
      <li>A much better option for me than the coralActive bar.</li>
      <li>I am sure it varies from person to person, and I feel better to have it to use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Highly recommended as an alternative to paying $25/bar for soon-to-be expired Panoxyl on ebay. :)</li>
      <li>Will buy more.</li>
      <li>AND it was available!</li>
      <li>it leaves a greasey film on top of the skin</li>
      <li>Worked better than PanOxyl though</li>
      <li>Stage one is the one he uses most...</li>
      <li>There is no reason to get a mechanical face scrubber because a manual one lets you control it a lot better.</li>
      <li>This stuff works perfectly, just make sure to moisturize after using this because it DOES contain benzoyl peroxide and can dry your face out, but that&#x27;s what you expect if you know anything about BP.</li>
      <li>This benzoyl peroxide bar effectively cleanses the oily skin of 16- and 60-year-olds, fights bacteria responsible for acne and preps the skin to make benzoyl peroxide treatments effective.</li>
      <li>The Panoxyl bar is good stuff, but you have to be cautious with it because it really dries out your skin.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping by amazon and good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it was something easily treatable.</li>
      <li>Bought when Panoxyl wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
      <li>and  it does not leave my skin oily free and refreshed as  the panoxyl bar I was using.</li>
      <li>Good soap so far - just received it.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist suggested that on hot sweaty days and most of the summer, I use this to keep bacteria at bay.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m looking clean and dry!&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I am pretty happy with my current results with my routine.</li>
      <li>and I am loving it so far.  </li>
      <li>Only problem is you have to do this for like a month or longer to see good effects.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad and it doesn&#x27;t leave the smell on your skin (in my opinion).  </li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed after unwrapping the bar was its strong, perfumed odor.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this soap for women or men with mild body acne.</li>
      <li>It did nothing for my mild acne.</li>
      <li>It is a nice benzoyl peroxide soap which does not dry out your skin.  </li>
      <li>It is not as effective for tough acne as the Panoxyl bar, but is good for mild acne cases.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth giving it a shot.</li>
      <li>It is okay but does not work nearly as well as PanOxyl 10%.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>It got here pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I got it all right, I used it, but I dont like its texture.</li>
      <li>But I am glad I did, because this soap seems to degrease my oily skin better while leaving it less dessicated.  </li>
      <li>This is a mild, gentle soap for sensitve skin.  </li>
      <li>Our 13-year-old daughter who is dealing with mild acne really likes this benzoyl peroxide containing soap bar.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s even better, actually.</li>
      <li>I actually like this better than panoply.</li>
      <li>I bought this exact product (coral actives &amp;#34;10%&amp;#34; benzoyl peroxide bar) from another retailer.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s very important to scrub your face for at least 1 minute and at night I will scrub on my face for 2 minutes using very warm water to also help open the pores.</li>
      <li>This soap lasts much longer than the liquid, too!  </li>
      <li>Was looking for a replacement for ZapZyt, but just didn&#x27;t work the same magic.</li>
      <li>I use it on my chest and the Panoxyl bar on my back which has tougher skin and tend to break out more.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is as dry after using it, and I&#x27;m getting the same great acne-killing results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Others in my household didn&#x27;t experience any significant difference at first, but later everyone felt this soap is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>In fact, she likes it better than the panoxyl bar (that has been discontinued) because it doesn&#x27;t leave her skin as dry.</li>
      <li>After religiously using it one to two times a day, I have seen a pretty significant improvement in my acne.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>The formula works very well for my oily skin type as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>One of my teens absolutely loves it.  </li>
      <li>My acne was very severe...</li>
      <li>This was extremely gentle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to the PanOxyl now that it is available again.</li>
      <li>My skin is very oily too.</li>
      <li>So far though, it&#x27;s worked much better than traditional cleansers as well as cleansers with salicylic acid.</li>
      <li>Most of the other products with peroxide in them ruin towels fast.</li>
      <li>but so far it seems to be as effective as the panoxyl for her in terms of managing her body acne (she is using other medication for her face).</li>
      <li>I plan on trying Irish Spring Body Wash, Clear and Fresh Skin soon for cost and economical reasons.</li>
      <li>However, on the positive side, this does not dry out my skin as much.</li>
      <li>I still have 2 bars fresh in their boxes because they simply do not work.</li>
      <li>The smell of the soap is good too, especially compared to other similar bars which smell like barf!  </li>
      <li>The coral actives soap is the first 10% benzoyl peroxide soap which does not dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>That would be a plus for some, but I live in the steamy south</li>
      <li>This is an objective bias free measure (as opposed to me saying whether it helped or didn&#x27;t help my skin, which could be caused by anything, but only one ingredient causes my towels to become bleached).</li>
      <li>but I really feel the combination of the exfoliating gloves and the CoralActives cleansing bar 2 to 3 times a day really have helped get my facial acne undercontrol.</li>
      <li>I use it 1 or 2 times a day depending on how my face feels that day, also sleep on a new clean towel every other day and in the shower, use a pore cleansing body gel (found at walmart) and a acne scrub for the face and use those in the shower.</li>
      <li>The CoralActives bar is exactly the same thing.</li>
      <li>I use a lotion applicator to apply Dr. Sheffield&#x27;s Clear Zit 10% Acne Cream.</li>
      <li>I am also 47 years old and my complexion is as oily today as it was when I was 17.</li>
      <li>The exfoliating glove really helps open the pores and helps get the benzoyl peroxide into the pores.</li>
      <li>It seems to work well so far.</li>
      <li>It seems acceptable as a body bar as the benzoyl peroxide works well, but this is far too pungent to use on my face.</li>
      <li>it has not been a complete solution.</li>
      <li>but with my current routine my skin is so much</li>
      <li>but it is harder to clean and put medicine on my back</li>
      <li>I buy this brand of cream because you can get a pack of 12 tubes cheaper then buying individual tubes and the back is a large area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This benzoyl peroxide bar effectively cleanses the oily skin of 16- and 60-year-olds, fights bacteria responsible for acne and preps the skin to make benzoyl peroxide treatments effective. The bar is a budget-friendly alternative to solutions.</li>
    <li> This is a mild, gentle soap for sensitve skin.  It also moisturizes your skin.  I have been using it for several months now.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because they have apparently stopped making the Panoxyl 10% bar again, or at least i can&#x27;t find it anymore, again...  This bar is smoother, I think the Panoxyl bar has a some slight abrasiveness that scrubs a little better, but that may just be my perception. Along those lines, I feel like the this bar is &amp;#34;gentler&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as well as the Pan bar.  That would be a plus for some, but I live in the steamy south and I&#x27;m looking clean and dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of weeks ago, Wal-mart came out with and Equate knock-off of the Panoxyl bar and I am loving it so far.  Same grittier texture and I feel it cleaning and drying my skin better.  A much better option for me than the coralActive bar.</li>
    <li> great product exactly like panoxyl that the doctor prescribed.</li>
    <li> This was extremely gentle. It did nothing for my mild acne. But was non-stripping, non-irritating and not very fragranced. Maybe it&#x27;ll work for someone else. Not bad. But not good, didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I got it all right, I used it, but I dont like its texture. It&#x27;s nothing like Pan Oxyl bar! Pan Oxyl leaves a nice feeling on the face. This one deosnt.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping by amazon and good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my country, we dont have peroxyde soap bar anymore. So sad !&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good soap, it help treat acne very fast and leave the skin non-oily. Try this before accutane!</li>
    <li> Finally! I found some AND it was available! It got here pretty quickly. It seems to work well so far.</li>
    <li> I use to buy Panoxyl&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide bar until it started becoming almost impossible to find in the stores/online. I&#x27;m glad I made the switch. The CoralActives bar works just as well but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like the Panoxyl bar. I also like that I can get the CoralActives shipped automatically at regular intervals through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I only used it for two weeks and my skin broke out so bad I dont even wanna come outside.</li>
    <li> This works well for me.  I started using this when the 10% benzoyl peroxide product became unavailable.  It says it&#x27;s 10% like the brand I was using but it doesn&#x27;t bleach my towels like the brand would if not rinsed off well.  The effectiveness is just as good though.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin as much as the brand did also.</li>
    <li> Our 13-year-old daughter who is dealing with mild acne really likes this benzoyl peroxide containing soap bar. In fact, she likes it better than the panoxyl bar (that has been discontinued) because it doesn&#x27;t leave her skin as dry. She&#x27;s been using it for about 3 weeks now. We&#x27;ll see what her dermatologist thinks in a month or so but so far it seems to be as effective as the panoxyl for her in terms of managing her body acne (she is using other medication for her face).</li>
    <li> This is an alternative to PanOxyl, but for less cost!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year now.  The smell of the soap is good too, especially compared to other similar bars which smell like barf!  The formula works very well for my oily skin type as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have switched to this product for good.</li>
    <li> Great product. Cleans your pores, gets rid of zits and prevents future outbreaks. Will not use anything else. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this exact product (coral actives &amp;#34;10%&amp;#34; benzoyl peroxide bar) from another retailer. I still have 2 bars fresh in their boxes because they simply do not work. I have been using benzoyl peroxide products for years, and the way I know they work is because they will leave bleach stains on my towels after a shower (a small price to pay if it helps my skin problems). These bars had no such effect on my towels or clothing after a shower. This is an objective bias free measure (as opposed to me saying whether it helped or didn&#x27;t help my skin, which could be caused by anything, but only one ingredient causes my towels to become bleached). I suspect the label is simply making an illegitimate claim.</li>
    <li> My acne was very severe...I have both facial and body acne especially on my back. My skin is very oily too. My current routine has helped me to get control of my acne and of course I still have occasional breakouts but with my current routine my skin is so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my face...I bought a pair of exfoliating shower gloves. I then started CoralActives Acne Cleansing Bar. The exfoliating glove really helps open the pores and helps get the benzoyl peroxide into the pores. I think it&#x27;s very important to scrub your face for at least 1 minute and at night I will scrub on my face for 2 minutes using very warm water to also help open the pores. I pat my face dry and then immediately put Clearasil on while the pores are still open, again to get the benzoyl peroxide into the pores. I have washed my face with various products but I really feel the combination of the exfoliating gloves and the CoralActives cleansing bar 2 to 3 times a day really have helped get my facial acne undercontrol. CoralActives bar is cheaper and doesn&#x27;t seem as harsh as the Panoxyl bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/CoralActives-Acne-Cleansing-4-25-Ounce/dp/B00880WKPC/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390494017&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;coralactives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Aquasentials-Exfoliating-Bath-Gloves-pairs/dp/B001C1LBG8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390494473&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;shower+gloves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my back, I am currently using Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash with a scrub brush.

My back has cleared up but it is harder to clean and put medicine on my back but there has been improvement. I plan on trying Irish Spring Body Wash, Clear and Fresh Skin soon for cost and economical reasons. http://www.amazon.com/Irish-Spring-Clear-Fresh-Ounce/dp/B007BF7D8Y/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390494942&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;Irish+Springs+clean+and+fresh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been thinking about trying Pantothenic Acid soon but I am pretty happy with my current results with my routine. I hope I have been helpful to anyone that has suffered as I have from years of embarrassing acnce. My skin is extremely oily too and I when I am out, I am constantly going to the bathroom to get paper towels or tissue paper to blot my face. I am also 47 years old and my complexion is as oily today as it was when I was 17. I continue the fight for clearer skin and wish all others the best...</li>
    <li> Was looking for a replacement for ZapZyt, but just didn&#x27;t work the same magic. Worked better than PanOxyl though</li>
    <li> Bought this after finding out the panoxyl bar was discontinued. I hate my acne but not enough to buy a 50 dollar bar of soap. The CoralActives bar is exactly the same thing. Works just as well and helps me to control my body acne. Would recommend to anyone who formerly used the panoxyl.</li>
    <li> This soap works well without bleaching your towels.  Most of the other products with peroxide in them ruin towels fast.</li>
    <li> If only gsk would get their act together.  This bar is a good alternative to the panoxyl bar.  Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the other name brands but at a much nicer price. I will buy more when I am out!</li>
    <li> This seems to work as well for back acne as PanOxyl but it certainly was a lot less expensive. However, it has a texture and aroma which I do not like when using this. However, on the positive side, this does not dry out my skin as much. When I can find PanOxyl again at a comparable price, I will return to using it.</li>
    <li> Had to use this when I had a skin yeast infection on my shoulders. Ugh, long story. Anyway, my skin started to look like I was developing vitiligo. Fortunately, it was something easily treatable. My dermatologist suggested that on hot sweaty days and most of the summer, I use this to keep bacteria at bay. Apparently, moisturizing and scented body washes were no good for sweaty summers. I found this bar to be refreshing and really good at cleaning my skin, so I continue to use it  (which is completely safe) regardless of whether or not I have a (temporary) skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*NOT FOR INTERNAL USE*</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed after unwrapping the bar was its strong, perfumed odor. It seems acceptable as a body bar as the benzoyl peroxide works well, but this is far too pungent to use on my face. Looking at the package, the second ingredient listed is simply &amp;#34;Fragrance.&amp;#34; To me, this is way too vague to be acceptable for use on my face. In the future I will buy the Equate Acne Cleansing Bar from WalMart for less than $5.</li>
    <li> Not as amazing as I had hoped. Don&#x27;t think I will continue buying this product. It did last a long time tho.</li>
    <li> Works just like Panoxyl</li>
    <li> Good for cleaning face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 and I picked up this product as a last effort before seeing a professional about my rather cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months to help contend with the acne on my chest, shoulders, and back. After religiously using it one to two times a day, I have seen a pretty significant improvement in my acne. The number of zits as well as the severity of individual zits has reduced a bit. It has also helped with redness somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have issues with the acne though, so it has not been a complete solution. So far though, it&#x27;s worked much better than traditional cleansers as well as cleansers with salicylic acid.</li>
    <li> I tried this bar while the PanOxyl bar was out of production.  It is okay but does not work nearly as well as PanOxyl 10%.  I&#x27;ve gone back to the PanOxyl now that it is available again.</li>
    <li> My son breaks out due to wearing football shoulder pads and helmet. This product does a good job of controlling my his  breakouts.</li>
    <li> Good soap so far - just received it.  It&#x27;s a PanOxyl 10 replacement since Steifel decided to stop making it.  This soap has a scent, but it&#x27;s sort of soapy/perfumy.  It&#x27;s not bad and it doesn&#x27;t leave the smell on your skin (in my opinion).  The bars are smaller than PanOxyl bars so you&#x27;ll go through it a little faster.  Also, this soap leaves no soap film residue on your skin.</li>
    <li> This works just as good as Panoxyl bar for a great price!  Value for the money and I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> In less than three weeks it cleared my face, but since I had severe acne I still have scares. Im seeing smoother skin, and fewer to no break outs each day. I would recommend this this cleansing bar to anyone dealing with severe acne.</li>
    <li> I do  not like the smell and  it does not leave my skin oily free and refreshed as  the panoxyl bar I was using. unfortunately I have not been able to find the panoxly bar at stores.</li>
    <li> I found this recently since Stiefle stopped producing Panoxyl. It&#x27;s a great alternative. I think it&#x27;s even better, actually. I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is as dry after using it, and I&#x27;m getting the same great acne-killing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended as an alternative to paying $25/bar for soon-to-be expired Panoxyl on ebay. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff works perfectly, just make sure to moisturize after using this because it DOES contain benzoyl peroxide and can dry your face out, but that&#x27;s what you expect if you know anything about BP. I use it 1 or 2 times a day depending on how my face feels that day, also sleep on a new clean towel every other day and in the shower, use a pore cleansing body gel (found at walmart) and a acne scrub for the face and use those in the shower. Then when out of the shower, use this bar, rub a little all over your face, and then get one of those little face brushes that look like a little brush for your back in the shower, they are cheap and work well. There is no reason to get a mechanical face scrubber because a manual one lets you control it a lot better. Then just rub the soapy lather on your face with the little brush for a minute or 2. Only problem is you have to do this for like a month or longer to see good effects.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser - no smell which is great! I&#x27;ve been using for a while and have noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I would have never tried this brand had Panoxyl properly maintained their supply chain for their 10% benzoyl peroxide bar soap... But I am glad I did, because this soap seems to degrease my oily skin better while leaving it less dessicated.  Nice packaging as well - honest size box and plastic wrapped bar.</li>
    <li> Bought to try as replacement for PanOxyl bars currently out of manufacture for the 3rd time in 2-3 years.  These have a smell that I just could not tolerate.  Pitched them.  Customer service at Steifel says &amp;#34;shooting for Fall (2013)&amp;#34; on the PanOxyl bars.</li>
    <li> it does not preform as good as  an acne soap the smell is srtong and its does not make the oily skin clean its more it leaves a greasey film on top of the skin</li>
    <li> My husband likes to take proactive but he uses the different stages at different rates.  Stage one is the one he uses most... This soap lasts much longer than the liquid, too!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Bought when Panoxyl wasn&#x27;t available. Although this says it has the same active ingredient (10% benzoyl peroxide), in my experience it simply didn&#x27;t work. It also seems to be quite oily, which is the last thing acne prone skin needs. And it has a nasty strong perfumed smell. When I couldn&#x27;t get Panoxyl, I thought this would be better than nothing, but ... it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have been using the coral actives benzoyl peroxide bar for about a month. I bought it as an alternative to the Panoxyl bar which is hard to find. It is a nice benzoyl peroxide soap which does not dry out your skin.  It is not as effective for tough acne as the Panoxyl bar, but is good for mild acne cases. I use it on my chest and the Panoxyl bar on my back which has tougher skin and tend to break out more.  The coral actives soap is the first 10% benzoyl peroxide soap which does not dry out my skin. It has shea butter in it, so it calms, soothes and does not irritate the skin.  I would recommend this soap for women or men with mild body acne. The Panoxyl bar is good stuff, but you have to be cautious with it because it really dries out your skin. I&#x27;m 45 years old, male who is on testosterone therapy (my T level was low), so now my skin is breaking out again just like my teen years...</li>
    <li> Finally,...I&#x27;ve found a replacement for the Panoxyl soap that I use.  It seems to work just as well, and it&#x27;s not too expensive either.</li>
    <li> There was definitely some improvement in the condition of my skin...actually a good amount of improvement.  Others in my household didn&#x27;t experience any significant difference at first, but later everyone felt this soap is worth the money.  I am sure it varies from person to person, and I feel better to have it to use.  One of my teens absolutely loves it.  I will continue to buy--its a lot milder than the some of the crazy \\&quot;scrub your skin to death\\&quot; chemical stuff out there and it is not at all drying.  Definitely worth giving it a shot.</li>
    <li> I actually like this better than panoply. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as bad. Blackheads and oily skin have greatly diminish.</li>
