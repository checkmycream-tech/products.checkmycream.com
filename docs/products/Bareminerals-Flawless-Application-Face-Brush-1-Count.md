      <li>Its size allows for easy travel in my purse cosmetics bag, too!</li>
      <li>Love this brush....</li>
      <li>Love it ...</li>
      <li>I use it mostly for my all over face color and radiances.  </li>
      <li>Love the color :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for loose powder.</li>
      <li>The product was shipped very quickly and I received it within 4 days of purchasing it.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;squatty\\&quot; handle makes application easy to control.</li>
      <li>Rare Ltd. Edition Bare Escentuals Flawless Face Brush is incredibly gorgeous and soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a teal, I would say, than the BRIGHT turquoise blue.</li>
      <li>This brush is cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>Exact same as my original at a fraction of price !!!!</li>
      <li>Its handle is small but the bristles are wonderful.</li>
      <li>The blue isn&#x27;t quite as bright as the picture shows.</li>
      <li>This is not the &amp;#34;full coverage&amp;#34; full size brush...</li>
      <li>It first it worked just fine</li>
      <li>This brush is so soft and it really provides good coverage.</li>
      <li>but it is still a pretty color!</li>
      <li>it is much smaller and more like the mineral vail application brush for a light coverage.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast, product just as in picture, and in original packaging.</li>
      <li>Still the fantastic quality I was expecting from this brush (which I had bought to replace one that is 6 years old!)</li>
      <li>:) I have had no issues with loose hairs from this brush as of yet and am thrilled overall with it.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be ordering more as my collection of BE make up increases.</li>
      <li>This brush is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I was getting a good deal for &#x27;the real thing&#x27;, but these brushes are no better than what you would get for $2 at a Walgreens.</li>
      <li>I love my limited edition</li>
      <li>It is also a nice color if you like a little splash of color in your make-up box.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Very versatile.  </li>
      <li>I love the whole bare Escentuals line, especially the make up.</li>
      <li>I have the exact same brush but the original that comes in the starter kit, and comparing this LE one to the original, the bristles were NOT soft at all, didn&#x27;t blend, barely applies any foundation!</li>
      <li>Love the teal color as well....adds a splash of color to the sea of black handled brushes I have.</li>
      <li>Brand new merchandise.</li>
      <li>This item is high quality and has a soft touch to your face when using it.</li>
      <li>it is very soft and gets the job done well.  </li>
      <li>Green color is \\&quot;fun\\&quot;, and the small length(4.5\\&quot;) fits great in my cosmetic bag.</li>
      <li>The brush was a litte smaller than I expected but is very soft and works well; it shipped to me very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I thought this would be as soft as the bare minerals brush.</li>
      <li>Do not buy this brush if you are looking to get the quality of the real bare minerals/escentuals brushes.  </li>
      <li>Bare Essentials brush!</li>
      <li>It is a legitimate Bare Escentuals brush (I worry I&#x27;ll get a knock off sometimes when I order online)</li>
      <li>It is the bare essentials brush</li>
      <li>It has all the quality of Bare Escentuals brushes.  </li>
      <li>I received this brush when I purchased my Bare Escentual cosmetic bag.  </li>

<li> I received this brush when I purchased my Bare Escentual cosmetic bag.  </li>
<li> I am currently using it with my Tranlsucent Mineral Veil loose powder.</li>
<li> Good make-up brush for power or base or whatever.  </li>

<li> but it is still &#x27;rough&#x27; in application.</li>
<li> Just as I expected !</li>
<li> What a let down.</li>
<li> The bristles keep falling out and it feels harsh against skin.  </li>
<li> I believe that is the secret for proper application.</li>
<li> The bristles are rough, and the applications is not good.  </li>
<li> I bought this item as a stocking stuffer for my mother who is obsessed with Bare Minerals.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just a small brush.</li>
<li> But the brush hairs are really hard.  </li>
<li> (I was worried like the previous review it may be fake)</li>
<li> The seller failed to mention the fact that this is a blush brush, not designed for an all-over mineral foundation.</li>
<li> I am planning to try mineral makeup base for the 1st time that I ordered from Amazon as soon as it gets here so this item will get used a lot.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received this brush when I purchased my Bare Escentual cosmetic bag.  This brush works great with my powder foundation, powder bronzer, or just to blend. The \\&quot;squatty\\&quot; handle makes application easy to control. Green color is \\&quot;fun\\&quot;, and the small length(4.5\\&quot;) fits great in my cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> This item is high quality and has a soft touch to your face when using it. It&#x27;s perfect for loose powder. I am planning to try mineral makeup base for the 1st time that I ordered from Amazon as soon as it gets here so this item will get used a lot. Hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a stocking stuffer for my mother who is obsessed with Bare Minerals. It has the \\&quot;i.d. bareminerals\\&quot; brand on it. (I was worried like the previous review it may be fake) The blue isn&#x27;t quite as bright as the picture shows. It&#x27;s more of a teal, I would say, than the BRIGHT turquoise blue. but it is still a pretty color! MOM&#x27;S GONNA LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> What a let down. I thought this would be as soft as the bare minerals brush. I believe that is the secret for proper application. The brush is on the coarse side. I even bought conditioning brush cleaner but it is still &#x27;rough&#x27; in application. The seller failed to mention the fact that this is a blush brush, not designed for an all-over mineral foundation.</li>
    <li> Love this brush....it is very soft and gets the job done well.  Great brush for a great price! Love the teal color as well....adds a splash of color to the sea of black handled brushes I have.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, product just as in picture, and in original packaging. Still the fantastic quality I was expecting from this brush (which I had bought to replace one that is 6 years old!)</li>
    <li> Works great, until the wires come out. then your left with access on your shirt. no bueno</li>
    <li> The picture makes this brush look bigger than it is.  It&#x27;s just a small brush. I am looking for a big poofed out one.  I kept it, not worth the effort to take back.</li>
    <li> This brush is exactly as described. It is a legitimate Bare Escentuals brush (I worry I&#x27;ll get a knock off sometimes when I order online) Love the color :)</li>
    <li> I love the whole bare Escentuals line, especially the make up. Their application brushes are some of the best. The product was shipped very quickly and I received it within 4 days of purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Nice product delivered in a timely manner :)</li>
    <li> Just as I expected ! Love it ... Exact same as my original at a fraction of price !!!!</li>

    <li> This brush is so soft and it really provides good coverage.</li>
    <li> This brush is cheaply made.  The bristles keep falling out and it feels harsh against skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This Rare Ltd. Edition Bare Escentuals Flawless Face Brush is incredibly gorgeous and soft. I am currently using it with my Tranlsucent Mineral Veil loose powder. While not my first face brush fom this company, I got a great deal on it and its handle is my favorite color! :) I have had no issues with loose hairs from this brush as of yet and am thrilled overall with it.

    <li> It has all the quality of Bare Escentuals brushes.  Good make-up brush for power or base or whatever.  It is also a nice color if you like a little splash of color in your make-up box.</li>
    <li> Thought this was a good deal.  But the brush hairs are really hard.  This is not a quality brush and I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great brush, just what I needed!</li>
    <li> This brush is really awesome. I bought it for some upcoming travel. It&#x27;s totally going to act as my mineral foundation, blush and bronzer applicator during a two week trip to Europe. Its handle is small but the bristles are wonderful. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The brush was a litte smaller than I expected but is very soft and works well; it shipped to me very quickly.  If nothing else, I&#x27;ll keep it in my travel make up bag.</li>
    <li> Brand new merchandise. Wrapped and everything. Very happy customer. I love my limited edition Bare Essentials brush! Good customer service.</li>
    <li> It first it worked just fine but now after several uses, they fibers come out onto my face. So do I already have to buy another one??</li>
    <li> Do not buy this brush if you are looking to get the quality of the real bare minerals/escentuals brushes.  This is a knock off.  The bristles are rough, and the applications is not good.  I bought this thinking I was getting a good deal for &#x27;the real thing&#x27;, but these brushes are no better than what you would get for $2 at a Walgreens.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful makeup brush! It is the bare essentials brush and I paid a lower price when I bought it then I could get from the company.</li>
    <li> I have the exact same brush but the original that comes in the starter kit, and comparing this LE one to the original, the bristles were NOT soft at all, didn&#x27;t blend, barely applies any foundation!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this brush</li>
    <li> This is not the &amp;#34;full coverage&amp;#34; full size brush...it is much smaller and more like the mineral vail application brush for a light coverage.</li>
