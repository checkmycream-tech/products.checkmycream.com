<ol>
      <li>Over all to the seller - very good, keep going!</li>
      <li>I see the difference and hope that you will notice as well when you make the purchase of this wonderful eye</li>
      <li>and I am very happy with the results that I have been getting!</li>
      <li>so I am so happy I have found now the Eye Gel by ANAITI !</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a great under eye gel,</li>
      <li>The cooling sensation is great.</li>
      <li>Between Anaiti’s age-defying face cream and eye serum, it’s nice to be able to look in the mirror again and feel like I’m looking my best.</li>
      <li>I have been trying for months to find a good product that would help with no result</li>
      <li>Makes me feel good about what I am putting on my skin.</li>
      <li>and then you notice how good the eyes are looking after applying your make, no puffiness for me at all.</li>

      <li>the longer I use this gel the better results i&#x27;m seeing!</li>
      <li>I chose ANAITI&#x27;s eye gel because it seemed like it had some pretty effective ingredients, the price point was excellent, and the guarantee was reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A great fragrance free eye gel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Advanced Eye Gel by Anaiti for weeks now and all I have to say are great things.</li>
      <li>The product feels nice but probably won&#x27;t buy again because of pump.</li>
      <li>However, now I feel so much better when looking in the mirror, which has increased my confidence when talking to people.</li>
      <li>I love  to use this at nights and will continue the use of this product at nighttime and not during the day when wearing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did -</li>
      <li>I notice that they are not as puffy any more</li>
      <li>Love it so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This serum is a non-invasive solution to dermal injections and is completely safe to use.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything to look more alert.</li>
      <li>This eye gel is pretty amazing!</li>
      <li>It took me time to get this darkness and it will take time for them to look better</li>
      <li>I had a function 2 days ago and saw friends I had not seen in about 6 weeks, and got many compliments that I looked so rested.</li>
      <li>The pump on this product in my opinion pumps out more product than needed.</li>
      <li>and I will show even more how my eyes are changing.</li>
      <li>I would say they have improved by about 60% if I had to put a percentage on it, and I’m hoping for more as I continue to use it.</li>
      <li>As a room for improvement I can say that I wish they put more in the bottle, may be I&#x27;m just a bit greedy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anaiti gave me this product for free for an honest #review of the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product day and night to make sure I could review it honestly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
      <li>Five Stars for so many reasons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That is one thing I love about the Anaiti brand -</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t stop using this one for sure.</li>
      <li>Seems to be working pretty good.</li>
      <li>I love The Advanced Eye Gel by Anaiti:&lt;br /&gt;-It</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that I had the opportunity to get a free bottle of this eye gel from Anaiti.</li>
      <li>It has a nice fresh scent as well.</li>
      <li>I also love the packaging, there is a little pump dispenser that dispenses the perfect amount of eye gel.</li>
      <li>I always use this eye gel along with other Anaiti products to get the best results</li>
      <li>The pump bottle ensures the gel stays fresher, longer, and it is easy to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This gel is perfect for those dark under eye circles that we all seem to sport too often these days.</li>
      <li>It does not irritate my skin or make my skin red or anything, it just smooths out the under-eye area beautifully.</li>
      <li>I feel way more attractive and it only took 4 weeks to start seeing improvement and 7-8 weeks to see significant results.</li>
      <li>Anyway hoping to see reduction in crow feet and fine lines.  </li>
      <li>I use it to diminish fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I can tell that over time this cream will make a huge difference in my fine lines.</li>
      <li>The Advanced Eye Gel by Anaiti is for you.</li>
      <li>This is important to me because I am turning 60 and my eyes look 75 years of age</li>
      <li>I can feel my under eyes tighten, it cools as it goes on, and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>So far so good, it seems to be doing everything</li>
      <li>It has been working well on the dry spots on the corners of my eyes and it really works great for puffiness - something I&#x27;ve struggled with over the years, regardless of how many hours of sleep I get!</li>
      <li>I love Anaiti products, they go on smooth and do exactly what they say they will.  </li>
      <li>so I was excited to see they have an eye gel as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It literally brightens and revives the look of the skin on my face, giving me a more youthful and vibrant appearance!</li>
      <li>It literally brightens and revives the look of the skin on my face, giving me a more youthful and vibrant appearance!</li>
      <li>Getting heaps of comments from friends about how much brighter and more \\&quot;awake\\</li>
      <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
      <li>so I haven&#x27;t had the full 28 days they say it can take for results to show</li>
      <li>almost a full month&#x27;s use</li>
      <li>love how this product is very lightweight.</li>
      <li>almost a full month&#x27;s use</li>
      <li>The gel is pleasant and refreshing - my eyes stopped feeling tired and I feel much better now.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cooling, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious smell or cloying texture like some eye creams do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I read about the clinical trials of the product and the great success that it had with all of the people involved, so I took a swing at it not expecting much after being let down so many times.</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and light, so I feel okay about using it before I see my mom whose COPD makes her really sensitive to smells, chemicals and odours.</li>
      <li>I have to confess, I&#x27;m pretty hooked on Anaiti Advanced Eye Gel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, The Advanced Eye Gel by Anaiti does what it&#x27;s supposed too - very well!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, The Advanced Eye Gel by Anaiti does what it&#x27;s supposed too - very well!</li>
      <li>It has certainly given me a feeling of more confidence when meeting people and that&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I generally knew that most stuff at the store didn&#x27;t work because my friends are always complaining about them, so I looked around online for an anti-wrinkle cream, and found the Advanced Eye Gel 3 months ago.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply with a gentle push on the pump dispenser, and it&#x27;s got an easy-to-snap-on plastic cap.</li>
      <li>Worth giving it a try.</li>
      <li>ALL opinions are my own ONLY, and are based solely off my experience with the product itself!</li>
      <li>have used this Advanced Eye Gel for almost a month now, and am pleased to say that I can definitely tell a difference on the skin around my eyes!</li>
      <li>ALL opinions are my own ONLY, and are based solely off my experience with the product itself!</li>
      <li>eye gel makes the skin around my eyes look so much more youthful, but that&#x27;s only the first of the many reasons I really like the eye serum.</li>
      <li>I loved that this product did not irritate my eyes, had a cooling sensation upon placing it on my eyes, absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>but I have had some very promising results already.</li>
      <li>I am amazed that it really works!</li>
      <li>this product may do exactly what it claims</li>
      <li>I personally did not like the watery consistency and prefer more cream based formulas.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep you posted;-)</li>
      <li>The first time I used-</li>
      <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
      <li>I have to unscrew and get the product from the pump supply tube- which makes me use more than necessary.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found Instant Wrinkle Smoothing Serum as an alternative!</li>
      <li>Thank you guys so much!</li>
      <li>I know I sound kind of vain, but it seriously makes a huge difference for me to be able to look in the mirror and not get depressed by the sight of my dark eye</li>
      <li>soft, smooth, silky, and supple!&lt;br /&gt;-It moisturizes very well!&lt;br /&gt;-After</li>
      <li>I was only looking for a really good daily eye cream, but I used it for a week</li>
      <li>soft, smooth, silky, and supple!&lt;br /&gt;-It moisturizes very well!&lt;br /&gt;-After</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The first time I used- the pump does not work.  I have to unscrew and get the product from the pump supply tube- which makes me use more than necessary.  The product feels nice but probably won&#x27;t buy again because of pump.</li>
    <li> I can tell that over time this cream will make a huge difference in my fine lines. Even with just a few weeks use, I can see visible results. I won&#x27;t stop using this one for sure.</li>
    <li> No matter how much sleep I get, I always wake up with dark circles under my eyes. I have tried everything to look more alert. Then, my girlfriend introduced me to Anaiti&#x27;s Eye Gel. I was skeptical at first, but she swears by it. I borrowed some from her and within a few days of using it, I was able to see a difference. Every night before bed, I&#x27;d dot a little of the gel under my eyes, and the next morning, I woke up looking refreshed. Even people at work began to notice. They began to tell me that I look like I just came back from vacation. I would recommend this product to everyone. It really works.</li>
    <li> It has a watery consistency and has no effect (good or bad) even after a month&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:daa983594c4118753f41fbb82db44325]]I have been using this Eye Gel by ANAITI for dark circles under my eyes for about a week now. I notice that they are not as puffy any more and I am starting to look like my old self. The skin under my eyes is  tighter, smoother and I am starting to see less wrinkles too! I am amazed that it really works!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:29e5d3375265a8b18025db3ae64f8b93]] This eye gel is pretty amazing! I use it to diminish fine lines and wrinkles. It does not irritate my skin or make my skin red or anything, it just smooths out the under-eye area beautifully. I also love the packaging, there is a little pump dispenser that dispenses the perfect amount of eye gel. I use it at night and I also use it underneath my makeup for a seamless application. It has a nice fresh scent as well. For a long time, I dealt with puffiness underneath my eyes as well as under-eye circles and this eye gel has pretty much removed all my problems completely. I also like that there are natural ingredients as well. Makes me feel good about what I am putting on my skin.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:c021e3590c5f5b932a306f73426e29cb]] As an Asian I&#x27;m proned to dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. This has completely made them disappear! Getting heaps of comments from friends about how much brighter and more \\&quot;awake\\&quot; I look! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Oh man. The dreaded under eye bags and dark circles have gotten me! I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to help and I&#x27;m so glad that I had the opportunity to get a free bottle of this eye gel from Anaiti. I&#x27;ve already fallen in love with their dark spot corrector so I was excited to see they have an eye gel as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week so I haven&#x27;t had the full 28 days they say it can take for results to show but I have had some very promising results already. I can feel my under eyes tighten, it cools as it goes on, and goes on smoothly. That last one is a big one for me! I can&#x27;t stand for face creams to go on clumpy or not absorb into my skin. The skin under my eyes looks and feels smoother, tighter, and my dark circles are fading. You don&#x27;t have to use a ton of this product and this bottle should last me a long while even using it twice a day. I&#x27;ve even found myself applying to &amp;#34;wake up&amp;#34; my eyes if I&#x27;ve spent too much time on the computer. The cooling sensation is great.</li>
    <li> Five Stars for so many reasons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye gel makes the skin around my eyes look so much more youthful, but that&#x27;s only the first of the many reasons I really like the eye serum. It&#x27;s easy to apply with a gentle push on the pump dispenser, and it&#x27;s got an easy-to-snap-on plastic cap. I got this gel as a gift, but after checking the website, I think the value is unbeatable since it lasts a really long time, it is much less expensive than comparable brands and it has a money-back guarantee. The scent is fresh and light, so I feel okay about using it before I see my mom whose COPD makes her really sensitive to smells, chemicals and odours. Of course, none of these benefits would really mean anything if the gel didn&#x27;t do its job, but it does really work! I&#x27;ve always struggled with dark, baggy circles under my eyes, and this gel is just about the only thing I&#x27;ve found so far that can make them nearly invisible. The skin under my eyes does still feel slightly raised compared to the rest of the surrounding skin, but the bags aren&#x27;t visible and the darkness is so faint that even my lightweight foundation completely covers it.</li>
    <li> I have never used a gel based formula for under my eyes. I personally did not like the watery consistency and prefer more cream based formulas. Because it is more watery consistency, a little goes a long way. The pump on this product in my opinion pumps out more product than needed. With that said, I would have preferred this product in a jar rather than bottle with pump. On the other hand I appreciate the pump because it is more hygienic. Now onto the claims. This eye gel claims to do a lot of things. Although I didn&#x27;t see instant results, I need to have realistic expectations. I have puffiness under my eyes due to lack of sleep and a few fine lines due to lack of hydration. Upon putting this product on my eyes every morning and night I see that my puffiness slightly reduces and my eyes seem more hydrated as my fine lines had minimal visibility. This product for me did not sit well under my makeup. I saw my makeup separating although I set my concealer with loose powder.  I can see that overtime this product may do exactly what it claims but I don&#x27;t think it would be a product which permanently will reverse all signs of aging. Once again, I&#x27;m just being realistic. I loved that this product did not irritate my eyes, had a cooling sensation upon placing it on my eyes, absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling soft. I love  to use this at nights and will continue the use of this product at nighttime and not during the day when wearing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****DISCLAIMER***** This product was sent to me for review purposes for free/discounted price.

    <li> [[VIDEOID:ea18f23ba190cba3a19f1fedbf90d6c8]] A great fragrance free eye gel.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any improvement !  And it stings eyes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Advanced Eye Gel by Anaiti for weeks now and all I have to say are great things. I&#x27;ve used this product day and night to make sure I could review it honestly.&lt;br /&gt;I love how this product is very lightweight. I also love that it only takes about a pea sized amount of product and that is enough to apply to both eyes. It&#x27;s so lightweight that before I do my makeup I can still use this product underneath it without it causing my makeup to cake up. It helps with fine lines, dark circles and puffiness. It caused absolutely no irritation and I have rather sensitive eyes and skin. So if you&#x27;re looking for a great under eye gel, The Advanced Eye Gel by Anaiti is for you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye gel for quite some time now and I am very happy with the results that I have been getting! I am a big &amp;#34;eye cream aficionado&amp;#34; but I am very particular with the brands that I use, as I have very sensitive skin. I tend to veer away from products that are too harsh on my skin and leaves that &amp;#34;chemical burn feel&amp;#34;. That is one thing I love about the Anaiti brand - it works well and is still gentle on sensitive skin. It has been working well on the dry spots on the corners of my eyes and it really works great for puffiness - something I&#x27;ve struggled with over the years, regardless of how many hours of sleep I get! I give this product two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.

    <li> Eye bags have gone down, there is less puffiness, and I look alive again. I don’t know how to thank you guys. I looked tired and felt tired always having that heavy feeling with my eyes. It was starting to really wear on my mind after not having success with natural remedies and store-bought creams. This product really improved the appearance of my eyes, and I’m surprised at how much of an effect it had on the overall look of my face. I feel way more attractive and it only took 4 weeks to start seeing improvement and 7-8 weeks to see significant results. Thank you guys so much! Mwah!</li>
    <li> My tired eyes are finally gone! It’s seriously been a long road of trying every anti-aging eye cream to get rid of the dark circles under my eyes. I always looked tired and just looking in the mirror would frustrate me because they those bags were always there staring me in the face, no matter how much sleep I got. I had read countless articles searching for natural remedies for dark circles under eyes, and of course those didn’t work. I’ve also probably tried at least half the eye creams at Walmart before coming across Anaiti Advanced Eye Gel.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:86d188b7abc81810ff2828cc15c01760]] I love Anaiti products, they go on smooth and do exactly what they say they will.  This gel is perfect for those dark under eye circles that we all seem to sport too often these days.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks.  So far so good, it seems to be doing everything is states.  My dark circles, puffiness, bags etc.. all seem to be reduced.  I had a function 2 days ago and saw friends I had not seen in about 6 weeks, and got many compliments that I looked so rested. Anyway hoping to see reduction in crow feet and fine lines.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted;-)</li>
    <li> I read about the clinical trials of the product and the great success that it had with all of the people involved, so I took a swing at it not expecting much after being let down so many times. But this one was different! I was a little discouraged after the first couple weeks of not seeing much for noticeable results (I’m super impatient), but I stuck with it and after 2 months, they are significantly reduced and hardly noticeable. I would say they have improved by about 60% if I had to put a percentage on it, and I’m hoping for more as I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I had always heard that the first thing people notice about you is your eyes, so I was super self-conscious having to walk around with heavy bags, and it really did a number on my confidence. However, now I feel so much better when looking in the mirror, which has increased my confidence when talking to people. I know I sound kind of vain, but it seriously makes a huge difference for me to be able to look in the mirror and not get depressed by the sight of my dark eye circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to share my results and possibly help some other women struggling with the tired eyes, and I especially want to thank the staff at Anaiti.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t 100 % certain about this Anaiti eye gel at first but after a few weeks people began commenting how my face looked younger and that I had a certain glow about me. Well now I use it as much as a part of my life style as say shampoo or moisturizer. It has certainly given me a feeling of more confidence when meeting people and that&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Sometimes you just reached that level of no matter how many hours you sleep, people look at you like you are a zombie ! It is so annoying ! I have been trying for months to find a good product that would help with no result so I am so happy I have found now the Eye Gel by ANAITI ! In just a few weeks my eyes bags look less swallen and the dark circles almost disappeared. It surely give me a fresher look ! I love it and would recommend it to anyone who, like myself, spend lots of time at work and has a face who looks tired very easily.</li>
    <li> Love it so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m starting to feel a little like that children&#x27;s storybook about giving a mouse a cookie, because the more Anaiti products I try, the more Anaiti products I want. I&#x27;ve been using Anaiti&#x27;s age-defying face cream for a few months now and have had such great results that I thought I&#x27;d try out this gel. I asked my roommate if I can borrow this one as well as previous Anaiti products she shared with me. My hope was that it would have a similarly smoothing effect on my puffy, dark circles under eyes. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about three weeks, and already my eye’s aren&#x27;t quite as puffy or dark-rimmed as they were. I hope it continues to smooth out that skin because I’m tired of feeling and looking haggard. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products over the years, with pretty minimal success, so it’s heartening to finally find something that looks like it’s going to work. As a side benefit, it’s smoothing out a few of those laugh lines I have on the outside corners of my eyes, which makes me feel tons younger. Between Anaiti’s age-defying face cream and eye serum, it’s nice to be able to look in the mirror again and feel like I’m looking my best. Next, I think I&#x27;ll try the neck and decollete cream before swimsuit season hits.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product, having tried others that claimed they&#x27;d get rid of the dark circles and bags under my eyes with little success, but the reviews, coupled with the fact it&#x27;s non-toxic and paraben-free, persuaded me to give Anaiti&#x27;s Eye Gel a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m glad I did - I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and not only does the skin around my eyes look a lot better, but my eyes don&#x27;t feel as tired either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this, and will be ordering another one soon. It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it for the results I&#x27;m getting.</li>
    <li> I tried this gel recently because I have dark circles under eyes and I tried to find an alternative to using lots of tonal cream. The gel is pleasant and refreshing - my eyes stopped feeling tired and I feel much better now. It also somehow makes the skin feel healthier. The product looks very close to how it is presented on the website - good packaging and excellent contents. As a room for improvement I can say that I wish they put more in the bottle, may be I&#x27;m just a bit greedy. Over all to the seller - very good, keep going!</li>
    <li> I have to confess, I&#x27;m pretty hooked on Anaiti Advanced Eye Gel. My crow&#x27;s feet had turned into deep, long wrinkles before I tried the wrinkle cream for eyes. They were so bad that I was considering having filler injections. I&#x27;m a little squeamish though, and I just couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of a needle that close to my eye. Plus, we&#x27;ve all seen filler injections gone wrong, and I didn&#x27;t want to be the laughingstock of our little town. I was skeptical about whether the eye gel would really work, but I&#x27;m happy to say that it does. I still have some wrinkles around my eyes, but they&#x27;re not nearly as deep, long or noticeable as they were a few months ago before I started using the eye gel. Apply the eye gel feels really soothing, too, and has become a relaxing part of my nighttime ritual.</li>
    <li> Hello! I just wanted to share my experience for anyone else who may come across this review. After working out in the sun for the past 20 years of my life, I&#x27;ve come to have some problems with my skin. I assume it is from sun damage. I have had problems like very dry skin, forehead wrinkles, and crow&#x27;s feet (from always squinting).    The crow&#x27;s feet bother me because I see other people my age who show no signs of wrinkles.  I generally knew that most stuff at the store didn&#x27;t work because my friends are always complaining about them, so I looked around online for an anti-wrinkle cream, and found the Advanced Eye Gel 3 months ago. In the 10-12 weeks that I&#x27;ve used it, my crow&#x27;s feet have shown a lot of improvement. My friends started to notice and have ordered some too. I took some pictures from day 1 so that I could see if it really was working and the changes are definitely there. Worth giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Beauty is in your eyes and when they look tired and darkness around them you look older than you really are and this Eye Gel helps that area with time. It took me time to get this darkness and it will take time for them to look better I believe and I was correct. All you have to do is place a drop on your finger and gently pat around the eye area. You will see the results start in three weeks and then you notice how good the eyes are looking after applying your make, no puffiness for me at all. The ANAITI&#x27;S EYE GEL does work. I would like to invite you to follow my blog for the month of August 2015 and I will show even more how my eyes are changing. This is important to me because I am turning 60 and my eyes look 75 years of age I thought now I see the difference and hope that you will notice as well when you make the purchase of this wonderful eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anaiti gave me this product for free for an honest #review of the product.</li>
    <li> I love the way this gel feels when I smooth it on, especially after a long day. It&#x27;s cooling, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious smell or cloying texture like some eye creams do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With incredibly sensitive skin and after years of intensive acne treatment as a teenager, I&#x27;m pretty careful about what I put on my face. But as I&#x27;m deepening into my 40s, the texture of my skin is changing and my crow&#x27;s feet are joined by deeper lines that are really making me feel and look old. I chose ANAITI&#x27;s eye gel because it seemed like it had some pretty effective ingredients, the price point was excellent, and the guarantee was reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just a week into using the eye gel, but it already seems like it&#x27;s working to plump up the skin around my eyes a bit. The crow&#x27;s feet are fading a bit, too, so that&#x27;s an added bonus. I&#x27;m really excited about how the results will be with just a few more weeks of consistent use.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working pretty good. Softens wrinkles and keeps puffiness at bay.</li>
    <li> The Advanced Eye Gel by Anaiti is a solution for wrinkles, puffiness, &amp; dark circles around the eyes - without needing painful facial injections! It is made in Canada in a certified facility, and is never tested on animals. This gel is completely non-toxic &amp; paraben-free! It can be used on both men and women of all different skin types! The formula for this Eye Gel took years of research to make for it&#x27;s fast acting &amp; long term results! One of the main ingredients, Eyeliss, is a mix of three active peptides - that boosts elasticity, firmness, and reduces swelling. Another special ingredient, Haloxyl, eliminates dark circles by absorbing dark pigments and reducing irritation! Complimenting the other two ingredients is a peptide called Matrixyl which boosts collagen production in the skin and reduces wrinkle depth and volume! Together those 3 ingredients are a powerhouse to help the skin around the eyes by firming the eye area, reducing dark circles, reducing puffiness &amp; bags under the eyes, &amp; visibly reducing the looks of crow&#x27;s feet and wrinkles around the eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this Advanced Eye Gel for almost a month now, and am pleased to say that I can definitely tell a difference on the skin around my eyes!

    <li> My skin was starting to lose its elasticity, with all the stress I experience from my job my skin is starting to age. Just like you I was afraid of getting dermal injections and I&#x27;m glad I found Instant Wrinkle Smoothing Serum as an alternative! This serum is a non-invasive solution to dermal injections and is completely safe to use. Not only did this product firm my skin but it made my skin softer and more hydrated within minutes after use! This product also helped even out my skin tone by reducing my pigmented spots. Unlike dermal injections, if you are not satisfied with Instant Wrinkle Smoothing Serum you are guaranteed your money back. That guarantee put my mind at ease and assured me that I had nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> After using for 2 weeks straight I noticed my fine lines and dark circles were going away. There is not a harsh smell to it It does not leave my skin oily or greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s with only a few eye wrinkles, no bags or dark circles and have never experienced any cosmetic sensitivities. I was only looking for a really good daily eye cream, but I used it for a week and I noticed I was developing bags and dark circles, so I stopped using it and it cleared up. I tried it again just to make sure and within a few days it came back.  No allergy symptoms, it just gave me what it advertised to take away!</li>
