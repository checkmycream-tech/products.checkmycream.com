<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am loving this face cream. My face feels firmer just after application and throughout the day. I have aging skin and needed to find retinol cream.</li>
    <li> That says it all.  It apparently is essential; for&lt;br /&gt;her comfort and beauty  She has been using this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> i think the title says it all. i have been using this for about a month and all i have to say it is just a good sun block n i have dry skin so it keeps it nourished all day. i do feel i am a bit more shiny by the end of the day. not much though. i don&#x27;t know if i would recommend it. ill update as soon as i finish so that i can give a better review.</li>
    <li> My skin looks better than it has in years</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a little over a month and I am very disappointed with the results. First of all, the cream is very greasy and upon application it feels heavy and makes my face look like shiny as if I&#x27;ve been working up a sweat. Secondly, I have not noticed any real progress in the appearance of my skin. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles but I do have a few acne scars that I thought would be lightened by this cream but I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I&#x27;m stuck with this product that I cannot use because it clogs my pores and gives me blackheads. Perhaps I will give it away to a friend or co-worker... But it&#x27;s still $15 down the drain. Wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of months now and love how my skin looks and feels.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar of Retinol Day Cream.  I am usually allergic to moisterizers but this has not given me any problems.  It&#x27;s not oily on my skin and I am able to wear makeup over it.  Pros:  My skin looks great and the product is inexpensive.  Cons:  I wish it didn&#x27;t have a scent, but it isn&#x27;t that bad.  This is the reason for 4 stars.</li>
    <li> The only substance that really helps with wrinkles is Retinol, and this product is packed with Retinol, yet it&#x27;s very easy on the skin, unlike Retin-A. It does work.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. After a few weeks my skin was noticeably smother and seemed to have more elasticity. Really like this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have all the items in this line and they are all great! I love this day cream because it doesn&#x27;t shine on your skin. All face creams with SPF leave a shiny/glossy skin surface that looks oily. This was the first one I came by that leaves the skin smooth and non-glossy. Absolutely fantastic!!</li>
    <li> Bought this cream after trying many other retinol products, in search of a replacement for a 600,000 I.U. cream that I bought in Argentina about six years ago.  This is by far the closest to what I&#x27;m looking for, and I love the fact that it has a bonus sunscreen.  Like a previous reviewer, I have rosacea, and I use my sulfur gel under this cream in the morning, then I&#x27;ve just started using the night cream in the evening.  My feel as though the fine lines around my eyes and cheeks are visibly smaller--I&#x27;m 40 but people often say they think I&#x27;m in my late 20s/early 30s.  The smell of this product is great, and the texture is quite thick--unlike other creams that seem more like lotions.  Initially I hesitated in buying this (at Harmon) due to the price, but I&#x27;m very glad to have tried it, and I intend to buy more right now through Amazon!</li>
    <li> The smell of cream was unbearable.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s my imagination but some wrinkles under my eyes are fading! Very thick cream so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> No retinol.  None of the active ingredients are even Vitamin A based.  There is a vitamin a ingredient, but it has to be processed by your body ones to make the chemical that makes retinol.  This chemical then has to be processed again to get the positive vitamin A effects.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this moisturizer is non-greasy and makes my face feel smooth.  It makes small lines in the face disappear and is gentle on my skin. It has SPF 15 for sun protection which is very important.</li>
    <li> have been using these products  all three, for 2 years, and my skin looks great,  in fact I am complemented all the time from my peers in the 60-70 age group who what to know how I have such a good skin,  it is this product and no surgeries.</li>
    <li> i first purchased this cream from marshall&#x27;s. couldn&#x27;t find it any more so i purchased it online. i have rosacea and this product does not make me break out. i love the way it makes my skin feels so i bought the whole line. thank you!</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth and feels great. I love the fact it has sunscreen and retinol. I recommend it as a daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this at a spa and loved it  but then my spa no longer carried it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It costs 1/3 as much here as it did at the spa  I use it daily</li>
    <li> This product works as good as more expensive products. It has a pleasant smell absorbs quickly. I don&#x27;t think it has the highest concentration of Retinol but it definetely has improved the look of my skin and is very gentle.</li>
    <li> Good face cream, with the benefit of retinol, and sun protection. Price is right fast shipment and I would recommend</li>
    <li> Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Petrolatum, Glyceryl Stearate, Retinyl Palmitate, PEG-40 Stearate, PEG-8 Stearate, Stearic Acid, Diazolidynyl Urea, Carbomer, Methylparaben, BHT, Xanthan Gum, Propylparaben, Chitosan PCA, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance, Silk Amino Acids, Tetrasodium EDTA, Ascorbyl Palmitate.</li>
    <li> Using this in the a.m. and the p.m. and over the weeks I&#x27;ve seen a significant change in my 63 year old skin. Dark spots gone, dry areas gone, pores smooth. I&#x27;m thrilled with the results. I also use it on my hands and neck and I no longer have crepe-y skin at the base of my neck (at the throat). I plan to keep using this until I get too old to remember what it is!! No irritation either, or any other undesirable effect. Impressive.</li>
    <li> i love it so much. i will recommend it to a lot of my friend.its nice to have it with other product.</li>
    <li> Very godd product. It met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery Washington satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend This product 100%.&lt;br /&gt;Considers it in my upcoming purchases.</li>
    <li> I normally use Wexler skincare products, but was temped by Skincare when I saw that it had the same type packaging.  Wow!  I get the same results at a fraction of the cost!!!!  I have bought the whole line and am extremely pleased.  The only reason for the 4 instead of 5 is the cream is a bit thicker and not as easy to spread.  However, that being said, it does NOT leave you greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have used it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Allergic to this product and haven&#x27;t been able to reach the seller to see if I can return and get a refund. Caused burning, itching, peeling rash.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is the best cream I have found with retinol. I use it everyday and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I have been using it on my skin for about 2 years.  It made a big difference in the first two weeks.  It is much less than products in department stores and works much better.  The new packaging is really nice too!</li>
    <li> I use this every day. It really works!</li>
    <li> I love this product. it leaver my skin very soft. Also is not greasy to the skin. I will buy again</li>
    <li> I waited to review this product after a few months of usage to ensure it was as good as it initially seemed.  It is better.  One of the best facial cream products I have ever used and I&#x27;ve paid as much as $120 for 2.5 ounces of the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; stuff.  I will never do that again, now that I&#x27;ve found this product.  My skin is brighter and tighter after 3 months of use.  Fine lines are gone or significantly diminished.  The very slight lines and inevitable neck sag that was just beginning, is now completely gone.  If I go a few days without using it, I can tell the difference.  Since using it, I have been told by several different people (strangers, work acquaintances, etc.) that I have my beautiful skin!  It has firmed up the skin around my eyes, and diminished all fine lines that were creeping up on me around my mouth.  I am 54, and while taking good care of my skin most of my life, I can say that this product has bought me several more years of healthy looking, more youthful skin.  I also use it on my decolletage, top of my hands and forearms, and elbows with equally great results.  I recommend it highly.... especially in conjunction with apple cider toner (2 parts apple cider to 1 part distilled water), and Earth Science cleansers and facial cream.  Light clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Great Product.</li>
    <li> I never  have used any cosmetics in life. I being a man am not used to it  but for some reason I just thought go for it and buy this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;OMG it really works. I waited to write this before to see it in action and I have notices all the  crows feet around my eyes disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;I use it all over face and I can totally tell is a great product. You have a lifetime customer now :)&lt;br /&gt;I am shocked that a cream  can do this. It took wrinkle out of brow in between eyes, crows feet, check wrinkles are smoothing out.&lt;br /&gt;Not that I was all wrinkly but at 52 I  am starting to age  and is showing  this is reversing it. YAY&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;I knew  Mom was using it  years ago going to TJ to buy it  and she looks great at 93 so if good for her good for me  TY again.</li>
    <li> while doing my research for the hyaluronic serum and vitamin c combo, i also remembered that retinol is a really good product for skin so i thought i&#x27;d try the Ldel Cosmetics Retinol Day Cream.  i love this, too, so i decided to use serum/retinol cream as my day skin combo.  this is a very nice day cream.  i&#x27;m very happy w. this cream.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the product.  Have already reordered so I don&#x27;t run out.  I have allergy problems and this cream didn&#x27;t bother me at all</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would be a budget version of Dermadoctor&#x27;s Poetry in Lotion, which goes for more than four times what this costs. I got some similar results as first, but not anywhere near the benefits of what Poetry in Lotion did for me. Still, this is a respectable retinol treatment that did not make my skin break out. The added SPF 20 is a nice touch, but SPF 20 is really not enough coverage for where I live.  This is a nice moisturizing cream as well. If you roll in the affordability, the SPF, and that it is a nice moisturizer, this is actually a very good product. It just did not get me the miraculous results I was hoping for. Still, I have used up most of it and will definitely finish the jar before I try to find a coupon for Poetry in Lotion. This is not a miracle product for me, but it is a reasonably good performer.</li>
    <li> The product is great. The lid on the day cream was shattered. The product is fine - I am using an old lid.</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this during the day (and their night version at night, and within 2 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks and feels more firm! I&#x27;m very impressed by the results, especially for how reasonably priced they are compared to most other Retinol creams.</li>
    <li> I like it ,Is very good day cream for your skin ,But if the price go down a little ,will be perfect</li>
    <li> I am 29 so I&#x27;ve upgraded from regular moisturizer to this retinol moisturizer in preparation of my next stage in life. I want to say that the fine lines under my eyes are diminishing. I&#x27;ve gone through one tub and am on my 2nd. even without the retinol it would be glorious. it&#x27;s thick and creamy but goes on light. smells lovely. get you some! :) i&#x27;ve been purchasing from TJ Maxx. Relieved it can be bought online!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I use the eye gel (really like it) from the same line. The day cream is okay, but I really had a time adjusting to the way it smells. It took a while to get used to wearing/having the smell on my face. The smell reminds me a bit of a candle that someone gave me called \\&quot;linen\\&quot; for it&#x27;s scent (didn&#x27;t like it either). The night cream doesn&#x27;t seem as strong smelling or annoying. Overall, I think the cream works okay, but probably won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother who loves this product. She originally got it from TJ MAxx at a less expensive price but they didn&#x27;t have it once she needed it.</li>
    <li> Usually I don&#x27;t care about smells of products but this one is way over powering. It&#x27;s all I smell all day and it makes me taste lotion in my mouth. I do not care for this product at all</li>
    <li> Good product, delivery as promised.</li>
    <li> Good product....I used it and my skin was smooth and it worked well for me.  I would order the product again.  It was also shipped very quickly</li>
    <li> It keeps my skin moisturized,reduces wrinkles, and glowing. It&#x27;s fairly light-weight, too.  I would definitely purchase again. I wold purchase the night cream, too.</li>
    <li> This Day Cream is great to keep your skin looking young and fresh. My only complain is that I can&#x27;t use it everyday since it makes my face brake out,so i managed to use it 2 to 3 times a week. Other than that i have noticed a great change in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this day cream seeme to work . I use the Skincare L del  night cream during the night and day and it seems to work better for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with over the counter products. I saw no noticeable results and wasn&#x27;t impressed. Go to a Medical Spa for your facial needs, not that much more expensive and they work.</li>
    <li> I did not like the thickness of this cream. It just sat on my skin it did not absorb in. I also did not like the fragrance it reminded me of sorbelene cream (yuk) I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a month and have not seen any visible results.  I take a picture of my face before I us it and after 5 weeks and no change.  But it has SPF so that is a small bonuse.</li>
    <li> Retinol is a wonderful product. I have used it for more years than I can remember. I truly believe it is the reason when I tell them my age that they always remark that I do not look that old. What a compliment.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months &amp; like the way it feels on my face. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s getting rid of my &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; but I still have hope:)</li>
    <li> I love how my skin feels after using this. It feels soft and nourished.  I am going to continue to use this until I die...and maybe after!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s My favorite skin care...Skincare LdeL Cosmetics Retinol Night Cream, 1.7-Ounce Jar....has sunscreen and is not sticky like some others.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle.  Absorbs into skin quickly, non greasy and has faded my freckles making skin even. I will continue to purchase due to results.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist told me the only thing that will help wrinkles is retinol.  So, I was looking for a product that wasn&#x27;t too harsh, but would do the job and wasn&#x27;t outrageously expensive.  I found the day cream to be too creamy/greasy to wear under makeup.  However, since this time I also purchased the night cream and I like it better, but I do wear it only at night.  I am using the day cream on my hands at night since I am in my 60&#x27;s and it seems to help the backs of my hands look better.  The night cream leaves my skin smooth, but can be drying if I use it every day.</li>
    <li> It has SPF 25 which helps after microdermabrasion facial. It calms the skin after peeling procedure and gives soothing effect.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this cream.  For the price,  I have not found a better face cream than this.  I have dry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful because it is not as fat and oily as most moisturizers for mature skin. It includes the SPF 20, but still does not leave a white film.  I am wearing it every day, and have done so for the last two years or so.  I will not switch!  The night cream is great also.</li>
    <li> Product did not work for my sun damaged skin</li>
    <li> received quickly and as described</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly.  So far so good.  Sometimes I get flaking on my skin but not with this cream.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; found this to be best.  I use it every day &amp; never have breakouts.  Youthful looking skin, I am told.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and I love it. Many of my friends compliment me about my face and say I have never changed. I am in my 70&#x27;s and not a wrinkle.</li>
    <li> i cant complain for the size.. seems to work and people have said. i look good for my age..but i have always used cream.. bought this due to the retinol.. will buy again.. it does irritate my eyes if i get it in there.. but i guess that is my fault..as i put it everywhere on my face!</li>
    <li> Been using this product everyday for about two years and really see the results.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I AM NEVER WITHOUT IT.</li>
    <li> Purchased to reduce my large pores.  In just a few weeks it seems to have done the trick and the price was right.</li>
    <li> The Skincare Cosmetics products work and are THE best Retinol Products on the market.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by paying higher prices.  Check out these products against the pricer ones - do they tell you how much Vitamin A is in them - usually not.  They state vague numbers such as .05% - really that is worthless.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28 and just starting to use these anti-wrinkle products for precaution.  When i first started, my skin was slightly irritated for about a week (which I read is normal for retinol products), but after that.. smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt!  The container lasted me about 5 months and I try to use it every day or night (not twice a day).  The fragrance is a little too much but for the value and results, I&#x27;m definitely a fan.</li>
    <li> This was my original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just alright.. honestly there are better products out there.. does not seem to have much effect in skin appearance. would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed (added a star)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started giving this cream another shot as a post peel moisturizer and I am liking it better now. Previously I had compared to the RoC Multi-Correxion 4-Zone Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30 and thought the Roc was better but I have changed my mind about that. The Roc makes my mixed skin look very greasy and shiny throughout the day in spite of make up, and this one also but much less. It also feel rich and nutritious for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, will finish the bottel but probably not by again. Will continue searching for a day time high spf cream that does not make my face look shiny. I would def recommend for those with dry skin though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the night cream goes, however, the Roc retinol is much better.</li>
    <li> I am a 73 year old man and have never had any skin problems nor ever used anything on my skin. My hair has never turned gray, my wife frequently remarks that my skin has never shown any signs of aging, and I have no wrinkles. I noticed several months ago that 2 small spots of skin were darkening, one on each hand, and I thought &amp;#34;Damn it has finally started!&amp;#34; At first I just ignored it, but finally I did some research to see if anything really worked. I have long believed that the enormous number of expensive skin care products my wife and most women (and men) use now are all just expensive baloney in fancy bottles. Reading Amazon reviews, which I rely on for most purchases, however, I decided to buy this product. Even one day later I could see the 2 spots were noticeably fading, and today, just 3 days later, it is hard to find them -- even though I know exactly where to look. If you didn&#x27;t know where they were, you would never notice them. I cannot believe how well this works. The smell is fine, but I do not cover my face with it, and now I wonder if any of the other stuff actually might work.</li>
