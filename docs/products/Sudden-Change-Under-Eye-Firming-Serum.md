      <li>It was amazing.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind a shiny under-eye area, it kind of does tighten the wrinkles.</li>
      <li>and I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would do anything.</li>
      <li>so far it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my under eye bags.  </li>
      <li>This was ok--nothing fantastic--slightly lower than ok, honestly...  </li>
      <li>Ok, this product does work, but it does NOT work miracles.  </li>
      <li>The price was better than I could find at our stores.</li>
      <li>I apply the product and make sure I wait 3 minutes and check look.</li>
      <li>I have always enjoyed using this product.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s okay,</li>
      <li>The untreated eye looked better.  </li>
      <li>I was ordering some more when I noticed the Under-Eye Firming Serum and decided to check out the reviews.   </li>
      <li>I feel so much better about my appearance.  </li>
      <li>without it being mixed into makeup (for me, it works best all alone).  </li>
      <li>many  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Some of the catalogs sell it for more.  </li>
      <li>Sigh...just more snake oil.</li>
      <li>Great product that really works.  </li>
      <li>some moisturizer works better for me.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I use to be able to buy it in Canada but for whatever reason I cannot&lt;br /&gt;find</li>
      <li>I tried many products and none worked until I tried this one.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I now see that more people are dissatisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>I was also informed that I was going to receive more product automatically every 60 days for over $50 each.</li>
      <li>Also think of this as more of a sculpting tool...</li>
      <li>Do not order the \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; from Wrinkle Erase!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Always feel better when I use this</li>
      <li>It was good to find the product at such a good price.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to apply, and visibly tightens the fine lines and area beneath the eyes.  </li>
      <li>I use it day and night--according to the directions, this is fine.   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using an under eye moisturizer for years and believe that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t have fine lines under my eyes.</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>My sister &amp; I have tried following the directions We think it works best if you put moisturizer on first wait</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s fine, too.</li>
      <li>Fine lines and wrinkles were still there, puffiness still plenty puffy.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of stuff, but being a light gel, this is fine.</li>
      <li>It works great not only on the eye area but also the forehead.</li>
      <li>I submitted an order for a sample of Wrinkle Erase and received an email stating that I would receive the product and could use it for free for 14 days</li>
      <li>, looks great as a result, she is in her mid 60&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s great, and moderately priced!</li>
      <li>However, when I was online ordering some product I clicked on the sponsored link claiming to have reviewed products and offering free trial samples if you pay</li>
      <li>and since then I pray each time I purchase it that it is still available.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making it available.  </li>
      <li>and it is very effective in taking away the sagging under-eye stuff and upper eye lid stuff</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>that is what originally sold me...</li>
      <li>I would probably rate this product higher, but I know that an under-eye firmer CAN do better than this one.  </li>
      <li>As a man I use it when we go on vacation and special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Another holiday gift from my dear sweet family.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive compared to so many of the products I&#x27;ve tried, so you don&#x27;t have much to lose by trying it.  </li>
      <li>Sudden Change Eye Serum is amazing, but you must know how to use it, properly, or for best results, which I don&#x27;t think is made clear in its directions, etc.  </li>
      <li>My very first use, I applied under eye and followed the directions to the detail.  </li>
      <li>I can rarely find it in the drugstore, so I always get it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>nothing looked different, until I smiled.</li>
      <li>right, but</li>
      <li>Sudden Change is probably worth buying, since I don&#x27;t think there is anything better on the market, but the Signature product spoiled me.  </li>
      <li>Flaking is a problem, and I&#x27;ve not been able to use it with any makeup--whether mixed in, over, or under--with success.</li>
      <li>If it does get dry looking then you just do what the directions tell you to do and you will be as good as new.</li>
      <li>I have already stocked up on enough of it to last me a lifetime, that&#x27;s how amazing I think it is!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Undereye Serum works great, following directions by using a small amount under each eye works&lt;br /&gt;best, overuse will produce a white residue on skin.</li>
    <li> I am 39 years old with very minor under eye bags, but extremely horrible dark circles.  My dark circles are the hereditary type with veins and blood vessels showing through thin undereye skin.  I was hoping that Sudden Change might help, but it apparantly only works for dark circles caused by puffiness and bags.</li>
    <li> Great product and price.</li>
    <li> The product really works as soon as you start putting it on BUT it leaves a crusty film as the day goes on!  My sister &amp; I watched Rachel Ray show &amp; saw them use this product-They never never mentioned the crusty film - My sister &amp; I have tried following the directions We think it works best if you put moisturizer on first wait about 10 min then put the Sudden change eye serum on. Definitely follow the directions in not putting to much on - just put 2 drops in the palm of your hand &amp; use that much only for both eyes. My sister suffers from graves disease &amp; has really bad bags under her eyes - This product works great for her - my bags are not that bad &amp; I seem to crust up no matter how I put it on So.. I probably will give my product to my sister &amp; not order it again!  (This review was submitted by my wife.)</li>
    <li> I developed puffy dark under-eye circles after sinus surgery a number of years ago.  I tried many products and none worked until I tried this one. I follow the instructions and just use a drop under each eye and let it dry before moisturizing the rest of my face.  I use Bare Minerals as make up, so after it is dry, I do put a concealer on at the bottom of the circle.  The only negative I notice is that it doesn&#x27;t last forever, but it makes an enormous difference.  I order it as a two pack every six month purchase so I always have enough because each little bottle lasts about three months.</li>
    <li> This product most certainly performs as advertised, but it only lasts a couple of hours. Flaking is a problem, and I&#x27;ve not been able to use it with any makeup--whether mixed in, over, or under--with success. Does not work if I use moisturizer prior to application, which I also don&#x27;t like since that means my skin gets dryer on the days I use it.</li>
    <li> I have used sudden change for years.As a man I use it when we go on vacation and special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a lot of it from amazon (the one from the( Rachel Ray Show ) It is my opinion and the opinion&lt;br /&gt;of many  that I know that used it that if you buy the one that says (NEW LOOK) on the box you might as&lt;br /&gt;well use nothing.We tried the old one on one side and watched as the skin got tight.We tried the (NEW&lt;br /&gt;LOOK) one and watched as it rolled down the check doing nothing.I took some to the senior center and&lt;br /&gt;the ladies said that I had watered it down.Believe me I would not give a penny for the one they have out&lt;br /&gt;now.You couldnt give it to me.I now see that more people are dissatisfied with the product.When I run out&lt;br /&gt;of what I have its over for me and this product IN MY OPINION SUDDEN CHANGE CHANGE MADE A&lt;br /&gt;SUDDEN CHANGE AND ITS BAD&amp;#62;DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> Hard to find&lt;br /&gt;Good deal with double pack&lt;br /&gt;Use sparingly.....mix with moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Works great&lt;br /&gt;Always feel better when I use this</li>
    <li> This actually does work pretty well.  The best way to use it is to apply it as directed, and then use an eye care cream over it.  After repeated use you can definitely notice a decrease in noticeable wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I tried putting this on just one eye to see how it compared with my other eye after treatment.  I followed the directions on the box exactly, and could feel the tightening a little (sort of like when you let glue dry on your skin) but it did NOT take any of the wrinkles or puffiness away.  It coated it, but made no improvement whatsoever.  Fine lines and wrinkles were still there, puffiness still plenty puffy. The skin around my eyes was identical. Dark circles still there too. You may as well go out and buy a bottle of Elmer&#x27;s glue.      Sigh...just more snake oil.</li>
    <li> This product has been much maligned.  I think it is an issue of it being improperly used.  I have been a faithful user for several years.  To the future user, you must shake the bottle, even though it does not say to.  Also, you must use a tiny drop per eye.  The liquid must be \\&quot; feathered \\&quot; to blend with the skin below.  Yes, there were times when it turned a white color and looked horrible, but used on clean skin, with no foundation, it works very very well.  Properly applied, it is undetectable. It erases all puffiness and makes my eyes look brighter.  An overall illusion of youth, from one tiny drop!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and planning to buy it again. It works well, tightening up the skin around the eyes without using much at all. Over the course of the day it starts to wear off and looks like white flakes but not a huge problem, I just reapply. I don&#x27;t apply makeup over it, I think it would cake up too much. Actually, this is all I need to use and I have had major dark circles and puffiness since I was a child, definitely heriditary as other family members have it as well.     Until I can find that \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; solution I am quite satisifed with this product. I plan to buy the 2 pack night repair eye cream this time.</li>
    <li> I like the product to tighten facial pores under eyes and throuhout face! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Does tighten up skin around the eyes and reduce undereye puffiness.</li>
    <li> I used this with mildly impressive results. But I noticed after a while, a residue formed that was kind of dusty, crumbly. Kind of like dried superglue?  Not real fond of this but if others are having results with using moisturizer under it (though directions say not to), I will try that. Also, I don&#x27;t like going out without sunscreen on my under-eye area, so using this alone during the day would not be an option for me.</li>
    <li> I gave this one star because in order to publish this, I was forced to do the star thing.  I haven&#x27;t used Under-Eye Firming Serum but I have been using Sudden Change Green Tea Night Repair Cream for a long time and so far it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my under eye bags.  I use it day and night--according to the directions, this is fine.   I was ordering some more when I noticed the Under-Eye Firming Serum and decided to check out the reviews.   It sounds to me like this is a rather troublesome product to use, although some people report positive short-time results.  So, I&#x27;d like to suggest that you try the Green Tea Night Repair Cream during the day instead of the Firming Serum.  It&#x27;s inexpensive compared to so many of the products I&#x27;ve tried, so you don&#x27;t have much to lose by trying it.  And I just love it--day and night!  As long as it keeps working so well for me, I&#x27;m no longer even tempted by the expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> Both my Aunt and I suffer from dark circles and puffiness under the eyes and she is the one that introduced me to this. When I first got it I hated it, it dried funny and left dry flakes and cracks behind that looked worse than the puffiness. Mixing it with concealor didn&#x27;t work, it actually made it worse. But then I began experimenting and here&#x27;s what I found out works the best for me...first I put on eye cream to moisten and smooth (hydrolyze, hydroxatone), and then instead of using my finger I squeeze a few drops onto a cue tip and then brush the cotton under the eye. And it works like a charm. But you have to be careful, if you get too much on the cue tip it will still crack. All in all, since I found out this little trick I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!  The firming serum made my skin around the eye WRINKLED. Wish I could get a REFUND on my purchase!</li>
    <li> I have found that the effects of this product have lessened.  I&#x27;m wondering if their \\&quot;recipe\\&quot; has changed. The tightness I used to feel just isn&#x27;t there any longer.</li>
    <li> I have used Sudden Change for several years. It works great not only on the eye area but also the forehead. It tightens the skin up. If cracking appears, dab on a little cream. It was available at Walmart a long time ago but now is hard to find in stores.  However, when I was online ordering some product I clicked on the sponsored link claiming to have reviewed products and offering free trial samples if you pay S&amp;H. I submitted an order for a sample of Wrinkle Erase and received an email stating that I would receive the product and could use it for free for 14 days and then I was going to be billed over $50 for it unless it was returned and the order cancelled. I was also informed that I was going to receive more product automatically every 60 days for over $50 each. Do not order the \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; from Wrinkle Erase! They are being very deceptive.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I first experenced this product when visiting my 96yr. old mother-in-law, she used this product daily, withremarkable results.  It is one of the best under eye firming products I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Do not recommend.  The firming serum made my skin around the eye WRINKLED.  Wish I could get a REFUND on my purchase!</li>
    <li> I saw this on a tv show as the greatest thing and it&#x27;s terrible. It dries and flakes off. You can&#x27;t use moisturizer around your eye and once you put it on you can&#x27;t touch it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly as directed but my skin looked like I had put glue on it and let it dry.  It actually accentuated my wrinkles and made them look even worse. I&#x27;m 50 years old and I&#x27;m guessing that it might work better for someone a lot younger than me with just a few wrinkles.  But even then - it made the texture of my skin very dry and \\&quot;pinched\\&quot; looking.</li>
    <li> on its own you can see where you&#x27;ve used it, leaves a visible mark where the cream has dried. mixed in with your concealer it feels very dry and if you wipe your eye the slightest bit it goes all flaky,  bit like some craft glues. its a shame cause it does work well, but its not a good look when its all dry and flaky..</li>
    <li> Price was right and appreciated fast shipment.  Prompt attention to purchase request.  Considering drug store prices, this was a real deal.</li>
    <li> Ok, this product does work, but it does NOT work miracles.  It tightens a little, but it will not make you look 20 years younger.  The best you can hope for is maybe 5 years erased.  I would probably rate this product higher, but I know that an under-eye firmer CAN do better than this one.  I have a dwindling bottle of under-eye firmer called \\&quot;Signature Solutions Wrinkle Soothing Serum\\&quot; that does indeed work miracles.  Signature is better than Sudden Change.  Unfortunately, the Signature product has been discontinued.  I have no idea why.  It was a one-of-a-kind product.  Currently I have been using the Signature product only on very special occasions, conserving the few drops left in the bottle.  I have been searching for a product that works as well as Signature Solutions Wrinkle Soothing Serum, but have yet to find one.  Sudden Change simply does not work as well.  I guess my search will continue.  Sudden Change is probably worth buying, since I don&#x27;t think there is anything better on the market, but the Signature product spoiled me.  So...I&#x27;m just giving Sudden Change a 3-Star rating.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of Sudden Change and I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would do anything. I have spent countless dollars on products that promised results that never worked for me so when the sample arrived I put it on my dresser where it sat for weeks. One afternoon as I was cleaning off my dresser I decided to give Sudden Change a try and I was absolutely astounded by the results! In a matter of minutes those bags under my eyes that I spent years ashamed of were gone! I know it&#x27;s a temporary fix but I&#x27;ll take it. I have skipped out on pictures over the years because of how deathly looking I looked but now I have the confidence to smile big in every picture. Sudden Change when used correctly is absolutely amazing. If it does get dry looking then you just do what the directions tell you to do and you will be as good as new. I can&#x27;t thank Sudden Change enough for this product. I have already stocked up on enough of it to last me a lifetime, that&#x27;s how amazing I think it is! I highly recommend it if you need something that will help with those baggy, puffy eyes!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product 4 weeks ago and it is absolutely UseLESS.  Did nothing the my bags under both eyes, didn&#x27;t possitively nada for the crows feet on the side of my eyes.  I scutinized this product careful and I am possitive it is senseless to purchase it.</li>
    <li> My very first use, I applied under eye and followed the directions to the detail.  I could not only feel a difference under my eyes, but could see slight bags dissappear!  It was amazing.  However, the manufacturer suggest you mix a drop or two with your foundation makeup.  This does work too, but you should only use very little of the serum.  If you use too much or use it before you apply foundation, it crumbs up on your face and leaves little flakes (almost like sunburnt skin peeling).  I like to use it when I&#x27;m not putting on any makeup. Or, I have used a little after applying makeup with only a brush-one powder foundaion (but very little of both) and the flaking was minimized.  It does work and  you really can see a difference.</li>
    <li> I really can see the difference under my eyes once I apply this product.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I saw this on the Rachael Ray show as did others. I tried the three products used. The least expensive, this product worked the best. My method is put on moisture product and foundation then I wipe the bag area.  Then I do my eyes because working with eye shadow and mascara can cause the film to break down and I would end up with cracks.I apply the product and make sure I wait 3 minutes and check look. If there is a pucker, I put a little water on my finger and pat the pucker. When this dries it is usually good. The product does only last about 4 hours but I have used the wet finger when I am out and it renews the effect a little. Enough that I do not have the really large bags. I actually have double bags under one eye. Try it play with it. I have it on subscribe and save. I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product. Initially I used it over my eye cream without makeup. WOW, it did take away the puffiness completely! Initially, I definitely thought I had found the answer to my problem. However, it made the under eye area dry and stiff, similar to the application of glue. However, the puffiness WAS gone. After a couple of hours, it flaked and looked like the under eye area was peeling. It also dried out the skin under the eye. The following day I mixed it with my under eye concealer as the instructions indicated. NOT GOOD. I found the results with makeup were even worse. I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t have any lines or dark circles. My problem is puffiness and it does totally take care of this problem. However, I don&#x27;t like the flakes and the way it dries out the skin. I&#x27;ve been using an under eye moisturizer for years and believe that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t have fine lines under my eyes. However, if I used this product on a regular basis, I think the drying effect of the product would initiate lines and wrinkles. I also can&#x27;t deal with the flakes.</li>
    <li> Great under eyes! Saw results immediate;u</li>
    <li> This was ok--nothing fantastic--slightly lower than ok, honestly...  Had to play with the amount used because I looked like I put some Emlers School Glue under my eyes when it dried-lol  After adjusting the amount to almost nothing, it still looked like I put glue under my eyes.  It didn&#x27;t really appear to make much of any difference~imho...it felt \\&quot;tight\\&quot; under my eyes--but it really didn&#x27;t *look* any different..but for 12 bucks--what did I really expect?  I actually returned it~ it may work for you--but it wasn&#x27;t my cup of tea...</li>
    <li> I have bags under my eyes.  A doctor said the only thing that will help is surgery.  I believe him, but hope springs eternal.  I bought a sample size in a drugstore $1.99, just to put an end my curiosity.   Well, I did what it said, removed any under eye makeup and applied as directed.  I cheated by using a hair dryer to hurry things along.  It is amazing!  For the first time in 10 years I saw what it would be like NOT to have bags (it&#x27;s hereditary).  And I must say, I looked good, even my husband noticed the difference.  BUT (wait for it), I don&#x27;t care what they say, you CANNOT put makeup over it, or even powder.  It does not dry smoothly.  And when I put on reading glasses (yes I&#x27;m over 40)and took a good look in my makeup mirror you could see it was shiny and kinda rough. If you follow directions and add a little make up to it, it just doesn&#x27;t work like it does alone.  So bottom line is yes it tightens it all up, but it looks a little weird if you look to closely.   That being said, I&#x27;ve resigned myself to having the surgery at some point, but until then I&#x27;m still experimenting.  Like I said, hope springs eternal.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I apply it after my makeup and it firms up the lines around my eyes and it lasts all day.  I can rarely find it in the drugstore, so I always get it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Apply every other day makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Works great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how well this product works.</li>
    <li> This product didnt work, it dryed on the skin very scaly. I would not recommend it to any one. It didnt tighten under my eyes at all.</li>
    <li> I have had this before and it works well. The price was better than I could find at our stores.</li>
    <li> it made the discoloration under my eyes disappear but not all the puffiness like i thought it would so i was kind of disappointed with the sudden change i had heard it would get rid of everything</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Dries up near the eyes and looks like you have concrete smeared by the outer eye. Just awful, nothing like their commercials on television. Ugh!</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  When used as directed, skin is firm, dry and flakey.  When used with some cream it&#x27;s a little better.&lt;br /&gt;I wasted my money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 78 years old and waken with bags under my eyes, of course.  After I put my makeup on I dab a drop or two of Sudden Change under my eyes, dab up any that runs down my cheeks, and away I go, looking at least two years younger.  However, after a couple of hours the benefit disappears.  But that&#x27;s okay, I feel fresh looking and pretty for those two hours and if necessary, I can apply it again.</li>
    <li> Great product that really works.  Really helped with my under eye when applying my makeup.  I love it and need less makeup.&lt;br /&gt;TMitchell</li>
    <li> You put this on and if you rub your eyes it is gone</li>
    <li> tightens up lines, but is drying</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve used the product for a few years now and really like it. I use to be able to buy it in Canada but for whatever reason I cannot&lt;br /&gt;find it in any stores now.&lt;br /&gt;  Dianne Wensley</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product!  Just use a small amt, if you see a whitish coating you used to much!</li>
    <li> This product works really well and even helps to reduce the lines around the mouth. Used regularly, you will notice the difference.</li>
    <li> I put this on and noticed bumps coming up, and my eyes became very ichy, I think I am allergic, so not using it again.  Be careful and test an area first, it ruined my day, because I looked bad for a few hours.  Just a really good nights sleep and some moisturizer works better for me. I have heard it works however.</li>
    <li> I love it I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time</li>
    <li> Both my co-worker and I tried this after she saw it on the Rachel Ray show.  After much experimenting (as it dries quickly, it may require a few tries to perfect the technique!) we determined the best technique is to 1. moisturize the area under your eye, let the moisturizer soak in.  2. apply your concealer as you normally would (i use laura mercier secret concealer).  3.  Mix a drop or two of sudden change with an equal size drop of concealer or foundation in the palm of your hand (i use lancome liquid concealer and just a tiny drop).  4. gently pat on. 5. let dry for three minutes. 6. do not touch or put anything else on top!! On both of us- she&#x27;s 50, I&#x27;m 30- the results are excellent!  It stays in place even through my workouts and seriously conceals my dark circles.</li>
    <li> This product DOES NOT WORK.  I used it under one eye to make a comparison.  The untreated eye looked better.  The treated eye had \\&quot;dragon wrinkles\\&quot; under it.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> The product barely made a difference even after applying multiple times. I suggest you take a pass on this one.</li>
    <li> The product did reduce the bags under my eyes but it gets flaky on my skin and that is not very attractive.  Still working with it to figure out how I can continue to use it without it flaking on my skin.</li>
    <li> I saw a small trial size of this at the local drugstore, and decided what did I have to lose for a few dollars?  Wow. I am amazed that it actually works.  Within 3 minutes, the stuff dries and the appearance of lines is diminished.  I have perpetual bags under my 45 year old eyes as well as dark circles.  The product reduces puffiness and probably the shadowy appearance of circles; but the actual darkness it did not, on me, completely erase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not last all day;  I sometimes reapply it midday.  My daughter noticed the difference.  I feel so much better about my appearance.  I would say I feel as if I look 5-8 years younger with the product on.  I had been looking into Restalyne - not seriously considering getting it because of how expensive it is at the doctor&#x27;s office - and I am thrilled to have found this product.  That is how bad I felt my bags looked, and how crummy I felt about how I looked before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I mentioned the learning curve, and I think there definitely is one.  If you want the product to work effectively and not have the flaky stuff underneath your eyes which I believe is probably too much excess product being applied, I think you have to be patient and fool around with it a bit - figuring out how far down to put the product, how much to use, and whether, in your particular case, it is better used with concealer and makeup or just with the product.  For example, when I used it today, I removed it and put it on a couple of different times because there was some flakiness the first few times until I got it right and there wasn&#x27;t any.  It removes easily with a wet washcloth.  I tried it with and without it being mixed into makeup (for me, it works best all alone).  There is a bit of residue noticeable on me, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it flakiness - maybe just a sparkly sheen which is hardly noticeable at all, and worth it to me for how much it minimizes the bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend, if you can, to try to find a small sample size which retails for a couple of dollars.  I found my sample at Bed, Bath and Beyond.  This way, you can try it and see if you like it first before purchasing a larger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it could be that it just works on some people and not on others - depending on the depth of the wrinkles, the puffiness of the bags, and the expectation of the user - who knows.  It does definitely work on some people - it did on me - but clearly, from reading these reviews, it doesn&#x27;t work on everyone.ll sample size which retails for a couple of dollars.

    <li> I purchased it for my wife....she noticed no Change and is not using it any longer.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product for my Mom, she loves it and I have to say, looks great as a result, she is in her mid 60&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Sudden Change Eye Serum is amazing, but you must know how to use it, properly, or for best results, which I don&#x27;t think is made clear in its directions, etc.  Stay with me on this now.  Through trial and error I have found that if it&#x27;s used - generously - morning and evening and several times during the day (if you must) if and when you may see your eyes puffing out (again).  Follow this regiment, faithfully, and it will decrease any puffiness under eyes and on the lids, substantially if not entirely!  Ater that, if you use it every morning and evening, you should have no puffs.  Also, it helps to let up on the alcohol intake and/or other substances that may be difficult on the liver or kidneys.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a shiny under-eye area, it kind of does tighten the wrinkles. It&#x27;s like a glue that shrinks as it dries. It is shiny when it dries. If you wear powder base, it will flake under your eye. It wears off rather quickly, especially if you squint at all. This is a very very short term fix, for taking pictures perhaps? It does not last a day and flakes if you even touch it. If you have an itch, DON&#x27;T....LOL. Guess it&#x27;s not exactly false advertising...but it is not really what you would expect per the television or ad results. Spend your money on something else.</li>
    <li> Use a good day cream, let is set.  And then mix a little of this with your makeup.  It&#x27;s great!  Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This product is something like elmer&#x27;s glue, when it dryes it cracks, it must be named one second sudden change, it will not last longer than that, buy it if you want to look like you woke up and didn&#x27;t wash you eyes.</li>
    <li> this stuff is a miracle!! 82 yrs old and the bags are gone.  Love it.  Husband, Hardin, doesn&#x27;t even know I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, they do not have to know everything, especially mine as he says &amp;#34;grow old gracefully&amp;#34;....yeah right, but&lt;br /&gt;enough is enough and if feel better about yourself, then do it.  Great product. Hopefully we can keep ordering it and they do not go out of biz.</li>
    <li> I order this for my 88 year old Mom who swears by it for minimizing the puffiness under her eyes.  She uses it every day &amp; has me order it when she&#x27;s running low.  By the way, at age 88, Mom looks great!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this. When it dried, it was very flaky and I had to wash it off. Now my face has broken out into hives because I guess I am having an allergic reaction to the product. I may have to go to the doctor now! Do NOT buy this. I will add a photo of what happened to me so this will not happen to you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and I must say, if I had to choose one cosmetic item, this would be it! I wake up with slightly puffy eyes for some reason and one drop of this takes that away. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. Highly recommend it. And I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of stuff, but being a light gel, this is fine.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This serum is a WHITE LIE...it does a \\&quot;sudden change\\&quot;, but it leaves your under eye with a VISIBLE white patch!!! Some reviews suggest applying a cream on top of it...applying the cream simply REMOVES the product; therefore DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> Make sure this product hasn&#x27;t been previously opened when you receive it!</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed using this product. It does what it says and then some. I have been using this product for about five years. I first discovered it at Walgreen&#x27;s Drug Store. Later, I couldn&#x27;t find it until I came across it on my computer.</li>
    <li> This product did not work. it was hard and crusty on my face and when I tried to put on foundation it mixed with the make up and did nothing to firm under my eye. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product in Arizona. It worked great!!! Then I came home to  Texas and was totally disappointed when I used it.  It turned white and caked off. In Arizona it worked beautifully. Could climate change have anything to do with it?</li>
    <li> Alright, everybody...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t watch Rachel Ray&#x27;s show with this item recommended...BUT this isn&#x27;t for dark circles.  This is for people who have those nasty wrinkle bags in their genectics, like me, and those whom the wonderful wrinkle fairy has visited, ditto on that one as well.  I have been using this product since about 2005, I guess I was around age 37 when I found it...and since then I pray each time I purchase it that it is still available. When I first started using this I was mistaken for my mid-twenties...that is what originally sold me...lol. I am still hiding...even from my husband...what I actually look like without this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for advice...I&#x27;d like to leave some tips that work for me.  For what it is worth...to those of you who have problems with flakes or an uneven appearance...try putting the serum on...then putting a drop of water or two over it before smoothing...it works for me. Some are suggesting mixing it with lotions and makeups...that&#x27;s fine, too. And, to those who are putting it on and having issues with smiling...try smiling while it&#x27;s drying, but not too much...or you will look like a double from \\&quot;Clockwork Orange\\&quot;...lol.  Also think of this as more of a sculpting tool...it will work anywhere on your face.  Try being adventurous with the product as it can provide you with great results if you put the time in.  I personally will use it anywhere there is a skin problem...hope this helps.</li>
    <li> For years I used this amazing product, and then I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. I was so excited when I found it on Amazon. Well, it&#x27;s not the same. The formulation has changed, and my under-eye area goes crusty within seconds. It&#x27;s not the same anymore. It used to be my miracle in a bottle, but sadly, no more.</li>
    <li> As a man,it did my eyes no good whatsoever.My One Star rating is because of the offort exerted in trying to design something that would help</li>
    <li> This works! But when it dries, it leaves a crusty residue like someone wiped snot under your eye. Sorry for being graphic but that&#x27;s what it looks like. Maybe if you had some family photos or maybe in a dark bar you could use this product.  The directions say to mix it with your foundation, but it doesn&#x27;t work unless you use it on bare skin, no lotions. Its too bad because it really does work, but in its current formula is completely unusable.</li>
    <li> It was good to find the product at such a good price.  Some of the catalogs sell it for more.  Delivery was prompt and the product is good.  Thank you for making it available.  jdm</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in the eye serum in that it really tightens as promised but it leaves my skin both dry and discolored clear hue looking in that area where used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, which was why I ordered it again.  The store where I previously purchased it was out of it, or no longer carries it.  It is easy to apply, and visibly tightens the fine lines and area beneath the eyes.  I think it&#x27;s great, and moderately priced!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for serious bags and it leaves a residue that is flaky-looking.</li>
    <li> It works well and contains hyaluronic acid, which is excellent for the skin.  My only complaint is that it is such a small amount.  Use sparingly!</li>
    <li> I have lots of allergy issues and wake up every morning with very puffy eyes. My morning routine starts with facial cleansing, administering allergy eye drops, then applying this. By the time I have finished my routine and get ready to put on my make-up it has &amp;#34;done it&#x27;s thing&amp;#34;. I just wipe off the dried excess with a buffer and make-up goes on with no problems. I even bought a purse size to take with me to use as the day progresses and my eyes sometimes get puffy again.</li>
    <li> Another holiday gift from my dear sweet family. I wish I could get them to check amazon reviews before buying something. Just as all the other reviewers have said this product does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I tried it alone. I was careful to follow the instructions and waited longer than 3 minutes with my face as still as a mask. I could feel the product drying so I got a little excited. When I went to the mirror nothing looked different, until I smiled. OMG! I didn&#x27;t even know I had so many wrinkles!!!!!!! This product did a wonderful job of highlighting my wrinkles and showing me just how bad they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I looked at the instructions again. There was a separate set for using with foundation. I don&#x27;t usually wear make up but have some on hand for special occasions. I followed this set of instructions, again carefully and again waiting. Still the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I got on amazon to leave a review and saw some suggesting using moisturizer. So this morning, the 3rd try, I did that. Still the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend purchasing this product if you have money to waste or can buy it in such a way that you can get your money back if it does not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going to pass mine on to other family in the hopes that I&#x27;m just a hopeless wrinkled mess and this can possibly help them.</li>
    <li> been using it for years and it is very effective in taking away the sagging under-eye stuff and upper eye lid stuff so you look awake and refreshed.  Thank you.  P.&lt;br /&gt;Coates</li>
