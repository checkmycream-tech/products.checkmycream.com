### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Delicious !!  </li>
      <li>I was so happy!  </li>
      <li>What a wonderful vanilla!</li>
      <li>Best smelling Vanilla perfume on the market.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with that effect.</li>
      <li>This is another really good one!</li>
      <li>However, I am really happy with this vanilla perfume</li>
      <li>Really happy with it.  </li>
      <li>Very happy with my Pafum1 purchase. : )</li>
      <li>Smells good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Purchased this based solely on the reviews here and am very pleased.</li>
      <li>My favorite vanilla scent remains Outremer Vanille Eau de Toilette by L&#x27;Aromarine, but this is a very nice scent for times</li>
      <li>I love the smell!</li>
      <li>My favorite!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is a pure vanilla smell, very good!</li>
      <li>This fragrance is warm (bourbon) and creamy vanilla.  </li>
      <li>It has a warm vanilla smell.</li>
      <li>considering I am a self proclaimed vanilla perfume connoisseur (in my own mind).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a warm and creamy vanilla just edible.</li>
      <li>I have received many complements.</li>
      <li>have since purchased the Tendre Madeleine scent, which I love.</li>
      <li>I really love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>Love &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>Lovely scent.</li>
      <li>I loved it from the first spritz.  </li>
      <li>I loved this in 05&#x27; ran out for years (thanks to sephora not selling them in their stores anymore, until I remembered eBay &amp; amazon.</li>
      <li>I did buy this based on the feedback from other reviewers and very happy I did!</li>
      <li>One I can wear anywhere not a smell that is too strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very buttery and warm, but not overpowering, and people always ask me about it.  </li>
      <li>This is a fabulous vanilla scent.  </li>
      <li>You will get many compliments I have been told I smell yummy like cookies or hot chocolate and also caramel.</li>
      <li>parfume was well packaged for shipment by the seller, and the bottle itself was in it&#x27;s original sealed box.</li>
      <li>I have really taken a liking to most of the Laurence Dumont vanilla fragrances.  </li>
      <li>No florals, no spices, just a simple but fabulous warm vanilla.</li>
      <li>, I think this kind of (please re-read kind of) smells like Victoria&#x27;s Secret Vanilla but much better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still better than many other scents</li>
      <li>I also like the price - very reasonable for such a lovely perfume.  </li>
      <li>It smells exactly-</li>
      <li>Outremer Vanille seems more of a pure strong vanilla whereas this Vanilla Bourbon puts me in mind of a soft french vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m feeling pretty lucky that I&#x27;ve discovered two uniquely different but almost equally fabulous vanilla sprays to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, others said this was a pure, buttery vanilla (exactly what I wanted),</li>
      <li>I love vanilla and had such high hopes for this one.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the bourbon vanilla as much as I used to.</li>
      <li>A friend of mine complimented me on it that day, and I just gave her the whole bottle since I knew I didn&#x27;t want to wear it again.</li>
      <li>I did notice after a few hours that the berry smell wore off and it was more plain vanilla, but I don&#x27;t want to have to wear a perfume for hours before it smells good to</li>
      <li>I am a real vanilla person and this one is a classic.  </li>
      <li>I use it to layer on top of my other vanilla perfume to pack a decent punch.</li>
      <li>but when I zealously tore open the box and first sprayed it on, it smelled like a vanilla candle and cherries or strawberries.</li>
      <li>Again, it was not bad, just not what I expected.</li>
      <li>This is by far the longest lasting, truest vanilla scent I have ever had.  </li>

    <li> I have really taken a liking to most of the Laurence Dumont vanilla fragrances.  This is another really good one!</li>
    <li> Oh man. I am so disappointed by this scent. I love vanilla and had such high hopes for this one. It smells exactly-and I mean, EXACTLY-like a vanilla tree car air freshener. I wish I were kidding. It&#x27;s just not a good vanilla. I ended up giving it away :(</li>
    <li> I have never before purchased perfume online, but after reading the reviews, I thought I had enough of an idea of what this would smell like. Well, I was wrong. It&#x27;s not unpleasant. However, others said this was a pure, buttery vanilla (exactly what I wanted), but when I zealously tore open the box and first sprayed it on, it smelled like a vanilla candle and cherries or strawberries. Again, it was not bad, just not what I expected. A friend of mine complimented me on it that day, and I just gave her the whole bottle since I knew I didn&#x27;t want to wear it again. I did notice after a few hours that the berry smell wore off and it was more plain vanilla, but I don&#x27;t want to have to wear a perfume for hours before it smells good to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since purchased the Tendre Madeleine scent, which I love. I wrote another review there.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent. I have received many complements.</li>
    <li> This perfume is light -it&#x27;s not a good base perfume, as it doesn&#x27;t last. I use it to layer on top of my other vanilla perfume to pack a decent punch. I&#x27;m very happy with that effect.</li>
    <li> I loved this in 05&#x27; ran out for years (thanks to sephora not selling them in their stores anymore, until I remembered eBay &amp; amazon. But...when I got it. I didn&#x27;t like the bourbon vanilla as much as I used to. I guess once bath &amp; body works vanilla bean Noel &amp; Victoria&#x27;s secret slice of heaven came out...this was just seemed to be missing the waffle cone linger that it used to seem to have. Or its just less by comparison.? My fella loves it though. I like it. Just. It like I used to...I discovered chocomusk smells similar but lingers longer. It&#x27;s still better than many other scents</li>
    <li> I love the smell! I get tons of compliments when I wear it. One I can wear anywhere not a smell that is too strong. It has a warm vanilla smell.</li>
    <li> Best smelling Vanilla perfume on the market. You will get many compliments I have been told I smell yummy like cookies or hot chocolate and also caramel. I did my research looking for a perfume with vanilla this had one of the highest reviews out there so I purchased it I was so happy!  There is nothing like it I loved it from the first spritz.  It&#x27;s just a warm and creamy vanilla just edible.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a pure vanilla smell, very good!</li>
    <li> Love!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this based solely on the reviews here and am very pleased. What a wonderful vanilla! No florals, no spices, just a simple but fabulous warm vanilla. My favorite vanilla scent remains Outremer Vanille Eau de Toilette by L&#x27;Aromarine, but this is a very nice scent for times I want a subtle vanilla. Outremer Vanille seems more of a pure strong vanilla whereas this Vanilla Bourbon puts me in mind of a soft french vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great vanilla scent is hard to find.

Very happy with my Pafum1 purchase. : )</li>
    <li> Delicious !!  Does&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
    <li> I really love this perfume.  I am a real vanilla person and this one is a classic.  I also like the price - very reasonable for such a lovely perfume.  I would recommend this to all my vanilla-loving perfume friends.  In fact, I already have.</li>
    <li> Smells good. .very vanilla extract.</li>
    <li> I need to start buying these 2 bottles at a time, I am constantly getting asked what I am wearing and women always want to know where to get it from!</li>
    <li> My favorite!  Love &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Agree with other reviewers!  This is a fabulous vanilla scent.  Vanilla is my signature scent so I have tried A LOT of different vanilla fragrances.  I like to give some context in comparison, I think this kind of (please re-read kind of) smells like Victoria&#x27;s Secret Vanilla but much better.  This fragrance is warm (bourbon) and creamy vanilla.  Really happy with it.  I always think it&#x27;s difficult to review perfume because what may work for me may not work for you.  However, I am really happy with this vanilla perfume considering I am a self proclaimed vanilla perfume connoisseur (in my own mind).  I did buy this based on the feedback from other reviewers and very happy I did!</li>
    <li> This is by far the longest lasting, truest vanilla scent I have ever had.  It&#x27;s very buttery and warm, but not overpowering, and people always ask me about it.  My husband is not a big fan of perfume, but he loves this.  He says I smell like cookies baking!  If you&#x27;re a vanilla fan, this scent is for you.</li>
