    <li> I purchased this product for my girlfriend she too is so happy with it I highly recommend this for all women to try ...Thanx</li>
    <li> I love the smell.....like aromatherapy at night.</li>
    <li> Love love love that is all</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have to drive all the way to Bath and Body Works, and it was an Add On.&lt;br /&gt;Clean, uplifting scent.</li>
    <li> This makes your woman smell like she just finished a graceful run through a field filled with flowers and butterflies.  If you like a good-smelling woman, then buy this and tell her to put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a woman and you want to smell like you just finished a graceful run through a field filled with flowers and butterflies, then you should buy this and slather it on.</li>
    <li> excellent aroma, happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I gave it two stars for the fragrance itself, but it far too strong! I wrote the same review for the coordinating shower gel. Both items are way to strong!! Recommend? I&#x27;d have to say no.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on what I am wearing everywhere I go. The smell is so refreshing you do not need perfume or anything.  As expected with Bath and Body works the lotion is good.  Helps keep my skin supple and smelling delish. I&#x27;d say if you like the scent of fresh flowers you will love this.</li>
    <li> This has got to be my favorite bath and body works scent. It smells like honeysuckle and spring. However, if you&#x27;re not a fan of flowery or sweet scents, this one might not be for you. I wish they still sold this one in the stores - I&#x27;d buy a ton of it!</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells wonderful, I will definitely reorder when I need more. It&#x27;s not greasy and the sccent isn&#x27;t overpowering. I will never need perfume again!</li>
    <li> I love the fresh light smell. Not overpowering, It has a lasting effect for all day wear. The price was great too.</li>
    <li> I love this body lotion.  It&#x27;s always been one of my favorites.  Several of the floral fragrances aren&#x27;t available at the Bath &amp; Body Works stores anymore so I&#x27;m happy when I can still order them.</li>
