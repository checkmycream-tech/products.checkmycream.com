### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the results and tease my friend how her gift is now costing me money.  </li>

      <li>It is wonderful!  </li>
      <li>All that said this is the best price I have found for the Time in a Bottle.</li>
      <li>very good for my face, after using this I would never ever buy anything from walmart for my skin, they all have perfumes in them &amp; contain alcohol in them which dries out your skin.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels great</li>
      <li>this is great</li>
      <li>It is great.</li>
      <li>happens to work great for us.</li>
      <li>I use a cream to powder foundation and that goes over it very nicely.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Philosophy&#x27;s Time in a Bottle for a month and the difference in my skin is amazing!</li>
      <li>All 3 products are amazing!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
      <li>Love this product my face feels wonderful!  </li>
      <li>Not oily, has a pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>To be fair I&#x27;m a non-sun sitting product freak with no wrinkles despite my 56 years.</li>
      <li>My skin has never looked better!</li>
      <li>I am in love with this product!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>I started using the formula for eyes a couple months ago--that&#x27;s amazing as well.</li>
      <li>Time in a Bottle is amazing</li>
      <li>A good retinol cream would be a better choice.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery, great sale</li>
      <li>We gave it as a gift &amp; she was pleased.</li>
      <li>It absorbs into the skin like magic.</li>
      <li>- I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to leak out where the top and bottle meet, but it does.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many creams, oils, masks, you name it.  </li>
      <li>This product works like magic.  </li>
      <li>After reading many reviews and speaking with retail associates I decided to purchase this face cream as a preventative treatment.</li>
      <li>Smell is okay but not inviting,</li>
      <li>I love this product and have used it for over a year.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product &amp; it was cheaper than buying at Ulta.</li>
      <li>I have taken it for more than a month and see no difference in my belly.  </li>
      <li>My skin has never felt or looked better.</li>
      <li>Love Philosophy products and</li>
      <li>This is just ok as well...</li>
      <li>My skin is firmer, the tone more even.  </li>
      <li>But the seller I am less than impressed with.</li>
      <li>For now, I love the shape of the weighted bottle, and the fact that you need to activate it by combining two substances is fun.</li>
      <li>For such a high price and good reputation (which I suspect has mostly to do with the brand loyalty of beauty bloggers), I would expect amazing smell, texture and overnight improvement of skin tone and texture.</li>
      <li>The product came and I was excited to try it.</li>
      <li>anyway, I like it, but I&#x27;m reserving a fabulous review for a full 30-45 day period of continual use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll review again after this bottle and see if there&#x27;s any significant improvement.</li>
      <li>I have to say I&#x27;m pleased the bottle I got is the real deal.</li>
      <li>I purchased this full size bottle after I received some samples from Sephora and used it for a week.  </li>
      <li>the other rhymes with ovaji lol.</li>
      <li>Went on smoothly, absorbed quickly,</li>
      <li>More money than I would normally pay, but it&#x27;s just that good that I&#x27;m going to use it and get rid of all my other stuff.</li>
      <li>Right away I said &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin right away.</li>
      <li>I put theTime in a Bottle on right after cleanser am/</li>
      <li>While I enjoy trying many brands, this is my current favorite, and it is definitely a quality product.</li>
      <li>and so glad I have finally found something I like.</li>
      <li>What I like about this product is that it goes on smoothly, and your skin does feel soft, not sticky.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>stuff is wonderful--it really works!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s the first thing to soak in.</li>
      <li>Together with Tarte&#x27;s Marjucua Oil and my favorite Mary Kay moistrizer mixed with sea kelp bioferment I have found my holy grail skin care routine.  </li>
      <li>Get strong Vitamin C serum from reputable known brands, not sure if I can list them</li>
      <li>Immediately noticed improvement in skin texture - although not in fine lines - will try another bottle before making final judgement</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>My skin is so smooth &amp; soft, refreshed, alive, &amp; luminous.  </li>
      <li>So far so good is about all I can say; it&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I use it each morning, on clean, dry skin, before applying my moisturizer and spf.</li>
      <li>I am 22 and have normal to oily skin.</li>
      <li>it goes on easy, a little goes a long way and it absorbs super fast leaving your skin so soft.</li>
      <li>Also, I can feel and see the new firmness.</li>
      <li>out loud!  </li>
      <li>I can easily and conveniently purchase it on Amazon and save a little money.</li>
      <li>Just plain old nice looking, younger, softer skin.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t figure out how this is supposed to help me have younger-looking skin, but I will use it until it is gone before I completely dismiss it.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft.</li>
      <li>In fact, it feels pillowy, plumping and soft.</li>
      <li>I was quite surprised by the results.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t come in the original packaging and it was missing the funnel to mix the two bottles together.  </li>
      <li>the new Purity made simple mask (at night).</li>
      <li>16 oz of Purity Made Simple cleanser, the new PMS one step facial cleansing cloths 30 count and the new PMS mask all for $50 and change.(that&#x27;s a 6 month&#x27;s to a year of cleanser)  </li>
      <li>Not sure if it is a true &amp;#34;philosophy&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>My crow&#x27;s feet (which weren&#x27;t deep but there) are barely visible now.  </li>

<li> My crow&#x27;s feet (which weren&#x27;t deep but there) are barely visible now.  </li>
<li> First, it is very drying, uncomfortable</li>
<li> I usually buy from Macy&#x27;s or Sephora but took a chance on buying on Amazon at a much cheaper price.</li>

<li> No shine, grease, strange color tints, nothing.  </li>
<li> I have been on a careful diet during this entire time.</li>
<li> but I have dry skin.</li>
<li> For my dry, beginning to age skin, my newest obsession is serums.</li>
<li> Tried to use less and less frequently and saw no results besides dry flaky skin.</li>
<li> I do like that the bottle did last me around 90 days, using it twice a day - a little does go a long way.  </li>
<li> I also have sensitive skin and this does not bother my face in the least.</li>
<li> Results are not instant (few serums are).</li>
<li> I know I&#x27;m not going to turn back time, but I&#x27;d like to stop some of the creeping signs of aging dead in their tracks.  </li>
<li> Overall, a waste of money for what I was looking for.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lotion leaked out of bottle. Package was a soppy mess! unreturnable.</li>
    <li> Save your money ladies.  It doesn&#x27;t work!  If it did I&#x27;d take a bath in it.</li>
    <li> This is just ok as well...I think it might help some after a couple months of use but nothing drastic.</li>
    <li> We gave it as a gift &amp; she was pleased.</li>
    <li> Not all cosmetics work on all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;This happens to work great for us.</li>
    <li> O. M. G.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used!  I received a sample from Sephora and had to try it.  My crow&#x27;s feet (which weren&#x27;t deep but there) are barely visible now.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I hate greasy creams and have went through many moisturizers and anti aging creams. They all go to my mom. Time in a Bottle is amazing it goes on easy, a little goes a long way and it absorbs super fast leaving your skin so soft. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin right away. I&#x27;m 41 and so glad I have finally found something I like. I usually buy from Macy&#x27;s or Sephora but took a chance on buying on Amazon at a much cheaper price. I have to say I&#x27;m pleased the bottle I got is the real deal. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t quite tell what the hype is about this product. Smell is okay but not inviting, texture is thin and absorbs quickly into skin but does not feel luxurious. Results are not instant (few serums are). For such a high price and good reputation (which I suspect has mostly to do with the brand loyalty of beauty bloggers), I would expect amazing smell, texture and overnight improvement of skin tone and texture. I can&#x27;t figure out how this is supposed to help me have younger-looking skin, but I will use it until it is gone before I completely dismiss it. For now, I love the shape of the weighted bottle, and the fact that you need to activate it by combining two substances is fun. Like a little science project.</li>
    <li> For my dry, beginning to age skin, my newest obsession is serums. While I enjoy trying many brands, this is my current favorite, and it is definitely a quality product. I use it each morning, on clean, dry skin, before applying my moisturizer and spf. For some, it might be hydrating enough to skip moisturizer but I have dry skin. I also have sensitive skin and this does not bother my face in the least. In fact, it feels pillowy, plumping and soft. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big cosmetic/creams person.  I received a bottle as a gift from a friend and decided to try it.  As a beauty product skeptic I was quite surprised by the results.  My skin is firmer, the tone more even.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results and tease my friend how her gift is now costing me money.  The bottle lasts quite awhile, though, so it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
    <li> It absorbs into the skin like magic. Not oily, has a pleasant smell.  My skin feels so soft. I rub the excess into my hands and they feel so wonderful!</li>
    <li> I purchased this full size bottle after I received some samples from Sephora and used it for a week.  This stuff is amazing!  My skin feels great and I can see the difference in the appearance of the crows feet!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product my face feels wonderful!  And my lines have diminished, couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! I&#x27;m 33 and want to prevent wrinkles and signs of aging for as long as possible. I have health issues that along with the medication I take was making my skin look dull. I have been using Philosophy&#x27;s Time in a Bottle for a month and the difference in my skin is amazing! I use it morning and night  after cleansing with Purity Made Simple cleanser and the new Purity made simple mask (at night). All 3 products are amazing! I put theTime in a Bottle on right after cleanser am/pm before I put anything else on my skin so it&#x27;s the first thing to soak in. Together with Tarte&#x27;s Marjucua Oil and my favorite Mary Kay moistrizer mixed with sea kelp bioferment I have found my holy grail skin care routine.  I could list all the product&#x27;s I use but we would be here awhile.&lt;br /&gt; I bought a package from QVC  on 5/1/14 that included, 1 liter of Purity Made Simple cleanser,  16 oz of Purity Made Simple cleanser, the new PMS one step facial cleansing cloths 30 count and the new PMS mask all for $50 and change.(that&#x27;s a 6 month&#x27;s to a year of cleanser)  If you&#x27;re looking to buy Philosophy look on QVC they run specials on Philosophy all the time. All that said this is the best price I have found for the Time in a Bottle.</li>
    <li> Noticed smoothing of my skin</li>
    <li> This product works like magic.  I noticed results instantly.  My skin is so smooth &amp; soft, refreshed, alive, &amp; luminous.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> works like a miracle, no wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> There is no miracle cure for aging. Maybe I will learn this before I go bankrupt from my attempts at discovering the fountain of youth ...&lt;br /&gt;This wasn&#x27;t terrible, however it did break me out and I didn&#x27;t see a change in my skin other than the breakout ...</li>
    <li> So far so good is about all I can say; it&#x27;s been a few weeks and I do see slight changes in my skins elasticity. To be fair I&#x27;m a non-sun sitting product freak with no wrinkles despite my 56 years. Thank my pale skin for the no sun....anyway, I like it, but I&#x27;m reserving a fabulous review for a full 30-45 day period of continual use.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while. It is great.</li>
    <li> This product is such a disappointment.  Certainly not worth the price I paid.  First, it is very drying, uncomfortable it&#x27;s so drying.&lt;br /&gt;After using the product one week I had breakouts which have very difficult to clear up, one blemish leaves, one breaks out.&lt;br /&gt;I can not recommend TIME IN A BOTTLE.  Toss it.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this and enjoys it. I like that I can easily and conveniently purchase it on Amazon and save a little money.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. My skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> I started using this product in February of this year. (I&#x27;m still on first bottle--it&#x27;s expensive but lasts!). Ever since I&#x27;ve been carded at bars, mistaken for someone in her 20&#x27;s, and get comments in my skin. I turn 41 next month. My skin has never felt or looked better. I started using the formula for eyes a couple months ago--that&#x27;s amazing as well.</li>
    <li> very good for my face, after using this I would never ever buy anything from walmart for my skin, they all have perfumes in them &amp; contain alcohol in them which dries out your skin.  This doesn&#x27;t  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Love Philosophy products and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product &amp; it was cheaper than buying at Ulta.</li>
    <li> Not what you get at Ulta</li>
    <li> I have tried many creams, oils, masks, you name it.  I got a sample of this in a magazine and tried it.  Right away I said &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; out loud!  Went on smoothly, absorbed quickly, made my face feel silky.  No shine, grease, strange color tints, nothing.  Just plain old nice looking, younger, softer skin.  That was with ONE application.  More money than I would normally pay, but it&#x27;s just that good that I&#x27;m going to use it and get rid of all my other stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using Time in a Bottle for about one year.  It is wonderful!  The look and texture of my skin has improved.  Also, I can feel and see the new firmness.</li>
    <li> Immediately noticed improvement in skin texture - although not in fine lines - will try another bottle before making final judgement</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this product and to me, that&#x27;s make or break time.  I know I&#x27;m not going to turn back time, but I&#x27;d like to stop some of the creeping signs of aging dead in their tracks.  What I like about this product is that it goes on smoothly, and your skin does feel soft, not sticky.  I use a cream to powder foundation and that goes over it very nicely.  What I don&#x27;t like is that it has a tendency to seep out when it&#x27;s in my make-up bag and I&#x27;m transporting it to the gym - I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to leak out where the top and bottle meet, but it does.  I do like that the bottle did last me around 90 days, using it twice a day - a little does go a long way.  I&#x27;ll review again after this bottle and see if there&#x27;s any significant improvement.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, great sale</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come in the original packaging and it was missing the funnel to mix the two bottles together.  Not sure if it is a true &amp;#34;philosophy&amp;#34; product.  I will stick to sephora or Ulta next time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this. Get strong Vitamin C serum from reputable known brands, not sure if I can list them but one starts with skin and the other rhymes with ovaji lol.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for over a year. But the seller I am less than impressed with. The item arrived today. The photo that is below is how I found the item when I opened it. For as expensive as this product is. It should not be damaged like this.</li>
    <li> I have taken it for more than a month and see no difference in my belly.  I have been on a careful diet during this entire time.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Targets the source of aging-your skin&#x27;s DNA&amp;#34;.  Puhleeze!  How gullible have we become?  Is it radioactive that it can affect our DNA?  With these claims, this should be labeled as a drug, or at $74 a bottle, at least come with George Clooney to apply it for us.  Just thought I&#x27;d check out the claims, but ain&#x27;t gonna waste the money.  A good retinol cream would be a better choice.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews and speaking with retail associates I decided to purchase this face cream as a preventative treatment. I am 22 and have normal to oily skin. I have dull skin and was looking for something to brighten it up. The product came and I was excited to try it. It dried my skin out so bad I was flaking like I had spent a week in Mexico. It was very uncomfortable and took awhile to stop the flaking after I stopped using the product. Tried to use less and less frequently and saw no results besides dry flaky skin. I ended up giving it to my 48 year old mom and she has been using it for a few months. She likes the product but hasn&#x27;t seen any actual skin improvements. Overall, a waste of money for what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> this is great I mix this with my cream .. and I already see the result!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! It is wonderful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is wonderful--it really works! It minimizes the wrinkles and is evening out my skin tone. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it lasts a long time.</li>
