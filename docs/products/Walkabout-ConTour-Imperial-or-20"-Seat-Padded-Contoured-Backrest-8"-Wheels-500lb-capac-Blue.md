    <li> Great buy. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased I have type II diabetes and have had problems with my feet because of that. With capacity of 500 lbs, I&#x27;m assured that this is a good solid assisted walker. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> A great deal. I use it every day!!!</li>
    <li> Seat is just a little too high and low as it can go.  Otherwise I love it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FOURTH ROLLATOR.  THIS ONE IS REASONABLY PRICED, WELL MADE, EASY TO PUT TOGETHER OUT OF THE BOX IN JUST MINUTES , AND THE BLACK TIRES ARE A PLUS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
    <li> AWESOME rollator!  It exceeded my expectations!  The price was amazing.  The quality is superb. Trust this product.</li>
    <li> WE BOUGHT FOR MY BROTHER IN LAW WHO HAS VERY BAD KNEES. IT WORKS JUST GREAT FOR HIM. ALLOWING HIM MORE ACCESS TO PLACES TO GO.</li>
    <li> Wheel and caster broke after just 3 weeks of use.  A previous Lumex product lasted a couple years before wearing out.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for.  great price too.</li>
    <li> I mom is a bigger lady and this gives her the chance to get out and have her own seat. She needed to wider seat. But note that she is shorter and when she sits her feet do not touch the ground.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I bought one for my husband who has Parkinson&#x27;s and gets very tired when we&#x27;re out. It&#x27;s exactly as described. He weighs over 300 pounds and it will support him quite well. The brakes are good. The seat is comfortable. He sits in it at restaurants. It&#x27;s easier to get up from this walker than a chair in a restaurant for him.</li>
    <li> This walker lasted six weeks. It was not even used daily. I was sitting on the seat and one of the legs collapsed and the wheel broke. I do not recommend this product or the store that sells it. They refused to refund my money.</li>
    <li> This Walker has made my life EASIER!  I can now sit down any time that I need.  This walker is a little more heavy than my regular Walker but considering the weight limit is 550#, I have NO complaints!</li>
    <li> I purchased this walker for my 90 yr. old dad.  He is of very short stature, so the seat is a little high for him, but otherwise he&#x27;s very pleased.  It was very easy to assemble and is very well constructed.  Many of the residents at his AL facility have complimented the walker and asked where he purchased it.</li>
    <li> works well ; the seat is wide and conferrable. could use locking brakes when parked.</li>
    <li> FINALLY, A BARIATRIC PRODUCT THAT IS A BARIATRIC PRODUCT. i SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THIS LONG AGO. IT REALLY IS STURDY AND I WEIGH OVER 400 LBS. I&#x27;M NOT AFRAID TO SIT IN IT WHEN I NEED TO. THE EXTRA WIDE PADDED SEAT IS A TRUE BLESSING. IT HAS OPENED UP A WHOLE NEW WORLD TO ME.</li>
    <li> the only thing we can find fault with is it seems a little wide for using in our house( thru doorways) but other than that it is really a stable unit that give a secure feeling while using.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this walker!  I&#x27;m unstable on uneven surfaces, and this walker allows me to walk with confidence on grass.  It&#x27;s very sturdy, and the brakes work very well.  I would recommend this walker for everyone who needs help walking (especially if you&#x27;re plus-sized).</li>
    <li> It has changed my life!  I had been using a cane and walking was slow.  Now I can walk right along with others.  Before I would hesitate to go to different events because I was afraid I would not find a place to sit, now I feel free to go to almost any event.  It is sturdy, folds up easily and stores easily in the back of the SUV..  I am 5&amp;#34;4&amp;#34; and when I sit on the seat my feet don&#x27;t touch the ground but I rest my feet on the back wheels or I just sit forward and rest my feet on the floor.  It comes almost fully assembled and the rest is just attaching and tightening.  Very easy.  I can&#x27;t say enough about the product.</li>
