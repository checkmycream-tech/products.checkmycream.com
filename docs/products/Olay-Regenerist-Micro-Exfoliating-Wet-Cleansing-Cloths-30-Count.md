<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love using these moist towelettes.  Great way to remove dirt and makeup leaving your skin clean and feeling refreshed.  Removes makeup with ease.  I am never without these towelettes.</li>
    <li> Gentle but thorough. Wipes are a great size.</li>
    <li> OIL OF OLAY, I HAVE USED IT ALL MY LIFE. GREAT STUFF AND NOT TO EXPENSIVE. ALL OF THE PRODUCTS ARE NICE TO USE.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin is super sensitive, but when I use these cleansing cloths my skin turns red and a little itchy. It&#x27;s a little harsh for me, will be switching back to Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> This is fine except I couldn&#x27;t tell that it was doing any exfoliating. I like that the sheets are already wet and it doesn&#x27;t require any rinsing of your face when your&#x27;e finished.</li>
    <li> I use these every night - hydrating and non-irritating.  Makes my skin feel great and does not cause me to break out.</li>
    <li> The only face cloth/makeup remover I buy anymore. Effectively takes off makeup and leaves face feeling clean and refreshed. An awesome Olay product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these wipes (bought at Walmart) for about a month, and really like them.  They exfoliate gently, so it takes about a week to have smooth, bright skin.  They are just rough enough to remove dead skin, but they don&#x27;t over-sand my face and irritate it.  They leave a small amount of moisturizer on your skin - enough that I don&#x27;t have to add separate moisturizer on my cheeks, although I still put extra moisturizer around my mouth and eyes.  They also remove makeup just like cold cream, and the Regenerist additives are supposed to help prevent signs of aging (I haven&#x27;t yet decided if that part works).  I was allergic to the ingredients in the Olay Regenerist cream, but these haven&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pack I bought at Walmart had a hard plastic \\&quot;door\\&quot; you could open to remove a wipe and then close to keep them moist.  The packs I ordered here on Amazon just have a stick-on mylar cover, which loses its sticky by the time the package is empty.  I&#x27;m taking away one star for this less useful closure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite result from these wipes is the way it&#x27;s improved the look of my neck and upper chest.  I&#x27;m middle aged and am starting to get loose skin on my neck and thicker looking skin on my chest.  The exfoliation and moisturizing of these wipes has made a visible different in those areas.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using these wipes during my bedtime ritual, and I recommend them to anyone who wants one-step cleaning and light moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is the only Olay product with which I&#x27;ve ever been disappointed, sorely disappointed.  I suddenly began having multiple painful pimples which coincided with using these cleansing cloths - on my cheeks, chin, and in the nasal labial folds, everywhere except my forehead.  I wasn&#x27;t certain that the Olay product was the culprit so I quit using them, allowed my face to clear-up, and resumed in a few days.  Sore, small pimples appeared almost overnight.  I&#x27;m going to search for other Olay products - the ones I formerly used for several years were wet cleansing cloths in a blue package similar to the black one for Regenerist.  I&#x27;m going to compare the labels so I can deduce which ingredient(s) I should avoid.</li>
    <li> These are my very favorite face wipes!! They are ao convenient when you&#x27;re on the go!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product especially for those of us (and you know who you all are) who are so tired and lazy at the end of the day to wash their face. This product makes that task all the less cumbersome. Removes makeup and dirt effortlessly and leaves skin refresh and moist. Highly recommend. I keep a pack in my purse as well my gym bag. Great product from a name you trust about skin care.</li>
    <li> They arrived &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;... now I have 2 more to use that are dry :( disappointed :(</li>
    <li> No more olay wet cleansing cloth. I tried to remove my eye makeup and it stinks real bad!&lt;br /&gt;I tried the other wet wipes too (by Olay) and they all hurt my eyes. :(</li>
    <li> I expected to find a &#x27;gritty&#x27; surface as in other exfoliating cloths I have used, but they don&#x27;t exist in this product. I use them strictly for cleansing, which was not why I bought them. I won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lazy about face care so keeping a small pack of these close at hand soles the problem of looking for my stuff amid a counter full of everyone&#x27;s stuff. Gentle. Have seen some reduction of redness after just 2 weeks. Great idea!</li>
    <li> I have been using Oil of Olay products for as long as i remember. I love their products. 1 single pack of the wet cleansing cloths is $9.00 so it&#x27;s a bargain for 3. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> These are great because you take off all your make-up with very little effort, so even if I&#x27;m half asleep or slightly intoxicated I can still use them. They also leave your skin looking moisturized and supple with the pores smooth, even on my sensitive skin. It is true they start to dry out after a bit but I always have a glass of water with me when I go to bed, so I just pour a few drops on and they are reactivated. Great value getting the value pack rather than buying individually at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Good and refreshing substitute for a full wash while traveling. Excellent for airports. Keeps my  skin dewy and fresh between flights.</li>
    <li> These were fine but certainly not much better than other cleansing cloths that I&#x27;ve bought which were much less expensive.</li>
    <li> I really like Olay products for the most part. So when I saw that they made exfoliating cleansing/make-up removing wipes, I was thrilled. Unfortunately, they neither exfoliated or removed my eye make-up without seriously irritating my eyes. Granted, it claims to be \\&quot;micro-exfoliating,\\&quot; but I have used other exfoliating wipes that actually did something. Then there is something that really irritated my eyes everytime I tried to remove my eye make-up. I always end up using a tissue to wipe my eyes after I used a cloth. Plus, the fragrance is rather strong. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll admit it...I am lazy when it comes to skin care.  That&#x27;s why I decided to try these and they are soooo easy!  Just a few wipes across my face, neck and decollette (sp?) and I&#x27;m ready for the next step.    I&#x27;ve been using these about two weeks and can tell a difference in the look of my skin.  It&#x27;s smoother and clearer looking.  Looking forward to seeing results multiplied by continued use.</li>
    <li> Would recommend to all my friends. I will be purchasing more at a later date. Great price  as well. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using these wipes for a month and have just started my second pack. I like the performance, love the convenience, but several wipes have been useless because they were barely moist.  The package has a little flap on the front that opens and allows you access to the contents. It reseals with some type of light adhesive that needs to be sticky to stay closed. The problem I have come across is that after pulling out wipes for a couple weeks, the moisture from the wipes starts to wet the closure and it becomes less and less sticky... eventually making gaps where it closes so that the air creeps in and dries out the wipes; this is especially bad right now with heaters running and the air being drier than normal. Several of the wipes were not even usable and I had to discard them to get to the good ones. --I hate waste. I solved this by storing the package in a zip-lock bag... Not a big deal, but would it really be so difficult for them to come out with some airtight packaging? Although slightly less convenient, I think the facial cloths that need water are much better.  Other than having to stand at the sink, they&#x27;re just as quick and skin feels even cleaner and softer than with the moist wipes.</li>
    <li> Love this facial cleaning product.</li>
    <li> After years of trying numerous facial cleansing products, I started using the old version of this product.  It was a dry cloth that required water.  It did an excellent job of cleansing, especially mascara. Unfortunately, the manufacturer discontinued that product and substituted this one.  I had tried this before and it is ok, probably better than most, but not super.  My face feels clean, moisturized, and looks great, but getting eye makeup off is not uniform.  I will stick with this for a while.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. When I&#x27;m getting ready for bed at night, I don&#x27;t want to be splashing water everywhere. This cleansing cloth provides me that luxury. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like so many other cleansers. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product depicted, which I have used for years, is not what you receive. Though the title is the same, the products that arrive appear to possibly be older versions of these cloths. The label and feel of the cloths are totally different.  The cloths received are much thinner and without texture, like a cheap baby wipe.  I have no idea if one works better than the other, or at all.</li>
    <li> I normally love Olay products. I previously used the dry cloths that need water but decided I should try the Regenerist version since my skin is aging. These cloths removed eye makeup which was great but they felt dry and made my eyes burn. The after feel was unpleasant and felt a little oily to me, to the point where I ended washing with soap. I will keep using to see if they grow on me but at this point, I will probably go back to the dry cloths.</li>
    <li> the wipes are so dry.  they must be very old inventory.  never again.  big disappointment.  fool me once, as the saying goes.</li>
    <li> These do a great job at removing makeup.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards.  They do burn your eyes if you use them to remove eyeliner or mascara but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really their purpose, but an all in one is nicer.  My skin looks fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have used these face wash cloths for at least 2 -3 years.  I obviously like them. I simply used a different means of getting these wipes to my door.  It worked.  So does going to Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again you are looking for something that is a lot more of a review than I plan on giving.&lt;br /&gt;My review is that I have used these for 3 years.</li>
    <li> I want to like these. ... I&#x27;m just not sure I do. I am using them everyday. I seem to have a burning reaction to them. Since this is the first item of this type I&#x27;ve ever tried, I&#x27;m not sure if they are all like that or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had oily skin my whole life and so when I started to develop dry, flaky patches in my early 60&#x27;s, I had no idea what to do.  I tried all sorts of moisturizers.  Nothing cleared it up completely.  Within three days of using this, I could see them getting better.  Within a week they were almost gone.  On the tenth day (today), they are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, my skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft and smooth in my entire life (oily skin never is).  I also thought I&#x27;d try them out on my hands since I do a lot of cleaning and they have gotten rather dry, as well.  After washing my face thoroughly, I use the towelette on my hands before throwing it away.  I am INCREDIBLY pleased with how much better my hands look and feel - they are even less wrinkled than they&#x27;ve been in years!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Especially for aging skin.  THANK YOU, Olay!</li>
    <li> These smell good and do a decent job taking make up off. My face feels fresh after using them, but I can just never remember to use them. I&#x27;m just not really a moist cleansing cloth type of person I think. I wish I was, they are simple enough to use, but I just cant get into a routine with them. Since I bought a pack of 3 I gave one of the packs to my Mom and she said the same thing. She likes them, just forgets to use them.</li>
    <li> Another great product from Olay. These clothes are a little smaller than others I tried but they are nice and damp and if used skillfully you can get a whole face of makeup off no problem. Absolutely lovely.</li>
    <li> Love these, quick and easy yet still provides all the benefits of good cleansing from trusted brand Olay.  Perfect for traveling too!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended to anyone who needs a clean face any time of day.  Removes all make-up and leaves skin smooth and clean with tightened pores.</li>
    <li> These work really well and smell so nice and clean. Great for taking off make up and for a refresher and any time . Nice and cool on your skin. Kinda exfoliates a little also.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes! I have tried others, but these are the best I have found. They leave your face feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. I carry a pack with me where ever I go, use them at night to remove make up, before exfoliating. I use them in the morning when I wake up. They seem to help alleviate that morning puffiness and really arouses the skin. I use them after working out and I use them whenever I need a quick refresh.</li>
    <li> I love the Olay exfoliating cleansing cloths that you put under water and lather up.  I thought these would be similar but they&#x27;re not.  These are pre-moistened cloths and I do not feel any exfoliation at all.  They are more like general makeup removing wipes but they are not moistened enough to be gentle on the skin.  I like Olay products but won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> for the nights that I go to bed exhausted, and forget to wash my face.... I keep these in my night stand, and instead of getting up, I&#x27;ll just wash my makeup off in bed. I don&#x27;t use them daily, but they are SUPER handy for those nights when I am just too dang tired to do my whole nightly ritual... and one wipe cleans off all my eye makeup (eyeliner and mascara) and thoroughly cleans my face. They do what they say.</li>
    <li> I use these morning and night.  The sheets are very soft and moist and your face feels clean after use.</li>
    <li> totally love these Olay wet wipes. I am an Olay die hard fan, and these are totally worth it. It removes all the makeup before I use my Olay face wash, and I have very sensitive skin. Totally recommend these wipes.</li>
    <li> I put on light make up everyday for work, the regular make up remover cloth smells a little too strong. I like this one because it is light and gentle. I am not sure if it is the olay wet cleansing cloth or just me, I don&#x27;t usually put on moisturizer at night, but my skin still looks good, I give olay wet cleansing the credit.</li>
    <li> Not great at make up removal. Cloths are too small and leave a residue on your face that has too be rinsed with water.</li>
    <li> I use regularly and think it helps keep my aging skin smoother. Used to buy at Walmart, but couldn&#x27;t rely on the product being in stock. It&#x27;s actually cheaper than Walmart, which sells them as individual packages.</li>
    <li> These wipes are moisturizing and do remove make up well but they make my eyes blurry. Not sure if it is the scent or something in the wipe. Really handy to have on the fly but would not use daily and I will probably not order again.</li>
    <li> So convenient and wonderful to use!</li>
    <li> These broke my face out.  I usually like most Olay products, but I was disappointed by these.</li>
    <li> Love these love how they clean your face. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love these cleansing cloths.  They removed my face make up &amp; eyeliner make up without irritation.  I strongly recommend these wipes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52; love the skin I&#x27;m in, moisturize more often than not...but usually, when I most need to wash up, like after an event/day that &#x27;requires&#x27; me to have makeup on, or a hard day weeding, sometimes I have no energy to get the washcloth out and do the right thing for my skin. These Olay cloths are simply a God- send. They clean nicely, keep their moisture well over 30 days, have a barely-there scent, and leave my face feeling fresh. I have to say I am an Olay fan...I&#x27;ve used the products since their first Olay moisturizer way back (what? 25 or so years ago?) These were a natural curiosity for me and my sister swore by them so I tried and agree: worth having around!</li>
    <li> My husband and I love these facial clothes and use them daily.  They are also so easy to bring along on trips and we pack them with us wherever we go.  They can be hard to find at times, until I realized that Amazon sells them - and at a great price too!  Now I am able to stock up much easier! :)</li>
    <li> I often do not have time to wash my face (either am or pm) and use this instead. Leaves me feeling clean. Definitely recommend. I have tried lots of Olay products and this is one I have repeatedly ordered via Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for years. I still use the regular cleanser, but I l love the cloths for removing makeup!</li>
    <li> I have used these cleansing wipes for several years. They keep my skin flawless. Excellent for makeup removal. I would recommend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> Zero exfoliating from these cleansing cloths.  Not good for sensitive skin either and it feels as if it is burning my face.  I had high hopes these would be terrific, and the price was unbeatable.  I&#x27;ll got back to Ponds cucumber exfoliating cloths which were fantastic.</li>
    <li> These are great can convenient. I&#x27;ll be ordering them again  :)</li>
    <li> I wanted to like these, the price is great and they are very soft but they just don&#x27;t remove make up very well. Don&#x27;t count on them to work on your mascara either. Additionally I couldn&#x27;t feel any exfoliation. I will use the cloths to put my eye make up remover lotion on until they run out.</li>
    <li> I have been using these cleansing towels for years and was glad to find them at Amazon.  It&#x27;s the only thing I will clean my face with.</li>
    <li> I expected the cleansing cloths to have more texture. Instead, the cloths had a thick tissue feel. There was not a lot of product on the cloths so I felt it wasn&#x27;t really cleaning well. I ended up using two cloths per wash. My skin ended up feeling oily even after rinsing thoroughly and days later I had some breakouts. I will not be buying this brand of cloths again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Every year I love it more. My skin is super sensitive to soaps and most cleansers so it&#x27;s nice to have something that cleans, is soothing, pleasant smelling and gentle to my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using these cloths for quite sometime, and have found that my pores are smaller and my skin is clearer.  The are excellent for removing makeup or just cleansing the face and neck.</li>
    <li> I was afraid these would irritate my sensitive eyes, but they were really great. I wish they were a bit bigger, as I used them to take off makeup, but they worked well enough.</li>
    <li> They were wet, but did not exfoliate at all, nor were they moisturizing enough. They are advertized as doing these three things and they don&#x27;t do either  except for the fact that they are wet, whic hs convenient.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves them.</li>
    <li> It is a great product thus far, and it does that which it advertised to do ...  I will order more in the future...  Great job Amazon ...  That&#x27;s why I shop with yo u guys...  You never let me down ...  Peace  !!!</li>
    <li> I use these cleaning towelettes daily to remove my makeup.  Love that I can buy a package of three so I don&#x27;t have to order so often.</li>
    <li> these are a great, reasonably priced wet makeup cleansing cloth.  I use them regularly.  The smell is not overwhelming and they are easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of cleansing without irritating your face.  Need to scrub a little to remove all traces of makeup.</li>
    <li> I love using these morning &amp; evening. My face likes them, too!</li>
    <li> I like these wet cleansing cloths a lot and use them daily, both morning and night.  They do well at removing the make-up that I use and leave my face feeling clean and refreshed.  I follow this cleaning with a moisturizer by Olay as well. These cleansing cloths go with me in my travel bag at all times. I like these much better than those wipes, that when wet are soapy, and then requires a couple rinses to remove.  I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, or dry skin from using the Olay Regenerist Micro-Exfoliating Wet Cleansing cloths.  These are my favorite of all brands I have used.</li>
    <li> I happen to really like Olay products.  These offer a quick solution to remove makeup without oily residue.</li>
    <li> I use these every night. They take makeup off easily and keep my skin clean. Then use plain water in the mornings... I have very few if any wrinkles and just turned 60! ;D</li>
    <li> I love these, they are so easy and convenient to use and help with anti-aging.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am so tired at the end of the day, and these are so easy to use.  They do remove dirt easily too. The cool wipes are refreshing too.</li>
    <li> I am too tired at night to do a proper face wash, and I find these cloths are a quick and easy way to get the job done thoroughly. I use Olay Regenerist after cleansing and my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it does a wonderful job of cleaning my skin and removing makeup. I like receiving the product every three months, so I never run out.</li>
    <li> I guess these being an oil of olay product I expected more from them. I will not be ordering more. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> These were very disappointing.  They leave a lot of makeup on your face, and they are not exfoliating at all.  Also, they start out with a nice moisture level, but dry out if you don&#x27;t use them up right away because the packaging does not reseal.  If you want a great wet cleansing cloth that is also exfoliating, try Equate Exfoliating Cleansing Towelettes (walmart.com for best price).  It&#x27;s a MUCH better product, and at a much lower price.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years - it was a great deal! would recommend these to my friends any time.</li>
    <li> Oil of Olay is a name I trust, and go back to again and again. These cleansing cloths are perfect. They make you feel like you had a facial. Gentle, thorough, and all you need to clean your face and remove makeup. The container keeps all the sheets moist and clean too. Closes tight and stays closed. A little hint: you can put a couple in a Ziploc bag in your purse to freshen up any time of day! (:</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It removes every bit of makeup and exfoliates my skin perfectly!  I hate being without it!</li>
    <li> use these cleansing cloths exclusively for facial care, never let soap touch my face... cleans extremely well without drying and just enough moisture to easily apply serums, creams, treatments daily... cloths are well sealed and never dry out, use AM/PM and have perfect complexion...high recommend for Amazon price, availability, quality</li>
    <li> Normally, I love Olay products and because of this, I purchased 3 packages of these wipes. While I can&#x27;t comment on how long they stay moist after opening the package (I just opened mine last night), I would like to caution other consumers that may want to use them to remove eye make-up. They started (mildly) burning my eyes as soon as the wetting solution in the wipes came in contact with my eyes. They did the job of removing my mascara and (light) eyeliner but left my eyes stinging for quite some time afterwards. I wear very little facial make-up...only a little blush and they worked well for removing that and cleaning my skin. My skin was also left feeling moist afterwards. The reaction with my eyes is going to be a deal-breaker for me for using them. They also left my eyes &#x27;blurry-feeling&#x27;, as if I&#x27;d used a make-up remover that contained oil. I tried to read after using them and it was difficult. Also, the next morning/day (it&#x27;s noon now...at my work) and I&#x27;m still feeling the effects), my eyes are feeling &#x27;blurry&#x27; and irritated. I&#x27;ll finish off the packages (I stupidly bought 3 at one time), to clean my face and go back to my old standard (Kirkland brand wipes from Costco) for any eye make-up removal.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps others haven&#x27;t had the same issue as me, since I see very few comments about this. But you might want to test them first yourself before committing to multiple packages.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to only buying Olay products for my face (not eyes), because I have found them to be excellent.</li>
    <li> Works well but really don&#x27;t see any difference between these and Equate brand that Walmart sells except for the price. They are very convienient if your really just to tired at times to actually wash your face. But I wouldn&#x27;t use these every single day of course.</li>
    <li> Smells great, leaves my skin feeling soft and silky. Removes all of the dirt and makeup with just one cloth</li>
    <li> My wife says they are too dry.  Do not remove make up good enough.  Leaves an oily/creamy feeling after using, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Cancel my order of Oil of Olay face wipes. I already have s supply of them.</li>
    <li> These are cloths are alright for basic cleansing and moisturizing, but they do not remove eye make up effectively. I have the Kirkland brand to be the best at overall cleansing and eye make up removal.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and I really like it.  It is great for taking off that make up and grime that accumulate on your face during the day.</li>
    <li> I love these wipe. They are great in between deep cleansing. Travel and just to fresh your face before your moisturizer</li>
    <li> I really love these face wipes, and go through them pretty quickly. This 3-pack is a great deal - so glad I found it!</li>
    <li> They do just what I want them to do. I use one before bed at night and they do a good job at washing my face. They don&#x27;t have a crazy smell and are not very chemical-y so I feel good about using them. I use them around my eyes and have never had any sensitivity or stinging either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one thing that might be a negative, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth taking a star off for it. These are OK with one day&#x27;s worth of stubble on my face, but when I use one if I haven&#x27;t shaved in a while, they get pretty tore up and leave white fuzz all over the place. I don&#x27;t think that was something Olay was planning on here so I don&#x27;t hold it against them.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and it is treated with Retin-A. As a result my skin is very sensitive. These sheets remove make-up and leave my sensitive skin feeling refreshed, clean and non-irritated. I am happy to have found a quick method for cleansing that is gentle.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think these would be worth it, but some nights it&#x27;s just the thing for a quick cleaning and moisturizing</li>
    <li> Does a great job removing makeup, but also moisturizes.</li>
    <li> I use this before bedtime instead of any other cleanser.  It makes my face clean and soft without drying it out.</li>
    <li> I am still on the first package because of the smell. Right out of the package it smell good and refreshing but after the skin dries (and the towel) there is a moldy odor. Just can&#x27;t get the odor. I keep looking at the package to see signs of counterfeiting, other than my packages are white instead of black cant tell.</li>
    <li> I like these cleansing cloths. They do tend to dry out toward the end of the package, but that is normal with any type of wipe like this. I just add a small amount of water to the package as they get low.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE CLOTHS!  I started using Olay Regenerist products several years ago and feel they keep my face and neck looking young!  People that see me don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m as old as I am because I don&#x27;t have wrinkles and my face still looks young!</li>
    <li> When I am feeling lazy and can&#x27;t do my normal face washing routine, this is SO easy and I feel better knowing I&#x27;m not sleeping in makeup and grime from the day.</li>
    <li> While I have only been using this product for about a week, I am pleased with the results.  My skin is feels softer and smooth.  If this keeps up I will really like this product.</li>
    <li> I use the Olay Regeneriest Micro-Exfoliating Wet pads every night to clean the makeup from my face.  I find that they do the trick for me and also moisuturize my face.  Try them, you will like them.</li>
    <li> I use it daily for cleaning and it is great as I use it before 2 other products I use for facial aging and damage.</li>
    <li> I started using these cleansing clothes so I can clean my face when I&#x27;m in a rush. They work great. I noticed an improvement in my skin since I been using them. I also like the smell of them. It is a faint, but rather pleasnt clean smell. I&#x27;m pleased wth results and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t re-seal well but I still like them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for many months now and have yet to find any better. I like the Subscribe and Save option - keeps me in stock, yet I can cancel or reschedule if need be (like when I go on vacation!) My skin feels wonderful - and although mine is fairly sensitive, these have not annoyed it at all.</li>
    <li> This product does not always deliver as promised. I need to use multiple instead of just one.  I still use some Olay products just not as fired up as I was.</li>
