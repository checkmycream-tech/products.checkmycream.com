    <li> I love this set, the second time I have used it</li>
    <li> These really weren&#x27;t a good value; they are much smaller than I realized and it&#x27;s hard to get the lids off.</li>
    <li> Grandson loved the variety!</li>
    <li> The amount charged for this item on the box is $29 and some change.  Obviously this was purchased at a department store.  lol and now the seller is trying to sell it for more money with the cheaper price still attached to the box.  Joke!</li>
    <li> Bought for my son and he loved it!!</li>
    <li> Several didn&#x27;t smell like the real thing, not just by my smell but sy several friends who I had smell of them al well</li>
    <li> I bought this set as a stocking stuffer for my husband.  When he tried to smell them the lids are very hard to get off and there is no sprayer mechanism so you have to be very careful to pry the lids off without spilling the cologne.  We thought maybe it was just the one, but all 4 bottles had the same issue.  We ended up returning it - bummer!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a practical case to carry in the car and use this fragrances in line according to the occasion, both for day or night events.</li>
    <li> This was a great by for my dad... He couldnt be happier...  Now for next year I will have him pick his fav and buy a big one...</li>
    <li> This made a nice gift for my teen-age son, who wanted a cologne a little more grown up than the &#x27;Axe&#x27; he used in middle school. This way he can try different scents while he decides what he likes.</li>
    <li> Bought this set for my 13 y/o after I caught him grabbing my Luna Rossa and Issey Miyake colognes. I chose this set b/c for under $30 I got an overall 2 oz of classic fragrances by Calvin Klein, one for almost any occasion...;-)...not bad. On to the fragrances, my 2 personal favorites among these are Eternity for Fall/Winter and/or evenings and Escape for Spring/Summer and/or daytime. Obsession, CK One are good &amp;#34;everyday colognes&amp;#34; imo. Any which way one regards them they&#x27;re 4 distinct scents I&#x27;ve known &amp; loved for years, and now my son loves them too.</li>
    <li> this is a great starter kit and since I ran out of all my other colognes this is is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get this for the men you love ladies!</li>
    <li> The product arrived faster than I expected and it was well packed. I really like it and smells good that my wife always noticed it. Great Job..</li>
    <li> I never wright negative comments but in this case I will. I order some perfumes online to stay away from the hustles of going out from store to store but in my case I got some other random package, I am unhappy with what I got but I guess I will keep it since returning it is much more work than I expected it. Just be careful with what you order an I hope you better luck than I did.</li>
    <li> my husband loved them and wanted more I may purchase him another set</li>
    <li> Great item very happy</li>
    <li> pleased with product and delivery was speedy.</li>
    <li> You have to pour them</li>
    <li> This is a review of Calvin Klein Variety by Calvin Klein for Men Mini Gift Set .  They don&#x27;t come with the sprayer but otherwise a great little set.</li>
    <li> Great Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> So tiny and cute I hate to porn them up &#x3D;( One bottle is worth three uses and that about it</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my son-in-law. He loved it.</li>
    <li> They all smelled nice except the obsession one it didn&#x27;t bother me tho 3 out of 4 is good</li>
    <li> I like this , he can try them first ...</li>
