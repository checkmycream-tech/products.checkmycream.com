<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was very nice. it also come in way early than I was expecting too.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture. The wig comes styled and everything. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great wig just needs to be trimed and styled alittle</li>
    <li> Love love love it so soft and easy to wear a little long but in fine with that :)</li>
    <li> … It makes my head look huge … It fits on my head, it just makes my head look big because the hair won&#x27;t stay down.</li>
    <li> All I need to do is trim the sides and bangs. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great quality wig. Really good for the price.</li>
    <li> Had to do some trimming but in the end I liked it, saved me a lot of time with the bangs/fringe and has a lot of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; weaved into it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good wig, I only have a few complaints but even so there minor things. First the top came a little matted, but I brushed it out and it was fine, second, it&#x27;s more of a brown than a black but it&#x27;s fine, and it was a little long, not anything a nice trim can&#x27;t fix. Other than that it&#x27;s a nice quality wig, the shipping was fast and the fibers strong. Love it!</li>
    <li> Okay so the wig first came in and I tried it on, it was kind of small and had none of the bangs and wasn&#x27;t thick at tall,meaning I would have to cut it and make it look right. Even when I tried to do this it wouldn&#x27;t work because it wasn&#x27;t layered enough for me to see where I needed to cut and where I didn&#x27;t. The part was also wasn&#x27;t anything like the picture and was very odd. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you wasting 20$ on this..</li>
    <li> The wig came with the part for Levi and I did have to do some trimming and styling myself only problem is that when I put the wig on it looks like I have a second head in the back of my head I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s like that or if there was something wrong with my wig cap and hair but it just didn&#x27;t look right.its just ok not perfect</li>
    <li> I actually got this a week ago, so it came way before the expected date. I love it! It&#x27;s soft &amp; comfortable to wear, but it does have to be cut &amp; styled. Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Actually a pretty good wig. It is lengthy though, so cutting it is definitely in order. Although the wig has a middle part instead of a part on the right side, i just adjusted it so that the part was on the right side. Anyways, i think this is a pretty good wig for the price.</li>
    <li> This wig is great :) with a little fixing it looks like Levi. I&#x27;m very pleased with this wig</li>
    <li> Great Product! My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I L O V E this wig so much! I actually am going to order another because I wear the one I ordered as just a male wig.</li>
    <li> As a cosplayer who&#x27;s been at it for 5 years I can honestly say this is the best Levi wig I&#x27;ve seen. It is perfect and doesn&#x27;t need any styling. However, I took a star away because of the packaging. The way the wig was packaged messed up the natural &amp;#34;part&amp;#34; in the wig. Easy fix but very annoying.</li>
    <li> The wig arrived a lot sooner than expected. It fit perfectly, but needs a little styling here and there but that it is what is to be expected. I would probably buy from here again.</li>
    <li> I rate this a 4. It was kind of thin, which I didnt like, and a little long which was a little long so I had to trim it. But overall , it was alright.</li>
    <li> So, I have never had to leave a less-than-satisfactory review, but I&#x27;ll start with the one bad thing. This wig has no bangs. The frontal split of the wig pushed all the hair to the sides of the face and didn&#x27;t give it the &#x27;Levi&#x27; look. Honestly I look more like Claude then anything. The wig is soft as black. But it sheds extremely easily.&lt;br /&gt;I will find another use for it or give it to a friend.  In the picture you an see the wig compared to the other</li>
    <li> The wig is poofy on the sides, and it lacks the undercut look. However, you can quickly cut and fix it, making it a good wig for the price.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best service I&#x27;ve ever had with a product EVER! I got this item from Anangelhair only a WEEK AND A HALF after I ordered it and they delivered it right away as well! I got it today with a little note hand written from Anangel and I&#x27;ve never felt like such a valued customer; it was so special. The wig is ALREADY STYLED AND BEAUTIFULLY AT THAT with REALLY SOFT JET BLACK HAIR and an awesome wig cap never opened before and everything!! I&#x27;m just so amazed by this service and quality and at a really CHEAP cost too. I 100% recommend this product for all Levi cosplays! :D :D :D</li>
    <li> Very soft and doesnt seem to shed to much...does need to be cut and styled but is super easy to do so even for those who are not used to doing so! I would recommend if you have a large head or lots of hair you invest in a different one becuase it is thinner in the back</li>
    <li> This is an awesome wig, especially for someone who doesn&#x27;t really know how to style/doesn&#x27;t style their cosplay wigs. It already comes with the part in the middle just as shown and the length is good and doesn&#x27;t really need any trimming. I love the wig and would purchase from the seller again!</li>
    <li> This wig is the best. It has fantastic quality. It only need a really small amount of trimming and thats about it. I would definitely buy this again if I needed to.</li>
    <li> The wig is a really nice quality, though when I put it on I realize that the bangs were a bit to long. But that can be easily fixed by just a trim, overall it is a really great product!!</li>
    <li> This is actually a pretty great wig... Mine was a little messy but nothing that cannot be fixed with a little water and hairspray. The bangs need to be cut a bit but overall I&#x27;m very happy with this.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> The wig is pre parted, so there&#x27;s not much I can do there. You will need to do some trimming/styling, but it feels really nice. It is on the shiny side, so I would suggest putting some powder on it to reduce the shine.</li>
    <li> The wig is very good quality, and is my first. The only issue I have had with it was that the bangs were too long for my liking, but they can be cut easily.</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig, obviously needs some styling put into it. Other than that, it&#x27;s soft and it&#x27;s comfortable to wear. I love it :)</li>
    <li> I had to cut the back a little cus it had an awkward tail &amp; the bangs but otherwise very good! It gives a lot of room to work it.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this wig- it&#x27;&#x27;s my favorite of all my wigs I have! It came fairly quickly, and was already styled very well for Levi. Although I ended up styling the bangs shorter, the length in the back was relatively perfect. This wig is thick so you can&#x27;t see your real hair, yet not poofy~! There is nothing bad I can say about this wig, to be honest. For the price it is literal perfection!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this wig. I ordered it on July 25th and I received it on August 4th&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the wig is what&#x27;s expected for $15. Which doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s poor. Usually I do a far amount of cutting on cheap wigs, but shockingly this wig was the perfect length. If I do any cutting at all it&#x27;ll only be on the sides to give it more of an undercut appearance. Where the bangs part the hairs have a matted look from being sewn to the mesh. Though combing them through with a comb and a bit of gel easily hides this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this wig overall to a person who isn&#x27;t comfortable cutting wigs, and is on a budget.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful wig, very soft and came quicket than expected!</li>
    <li> Shipped very quickly.  Good quality for the price.  The only thing negative about it is mine looked nothing like the picture.</li>
    <li> Recieved it fast shipping and I absolutely love it!!!&amp;#60;3 It&#x27;s cut just like the picture and it&#x27;s NOT a dark brown!! :DDDD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is where the hair splits...obviously we have to style that part ourselves x3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the wig :3</li>
    <li> This wig was very good quality and arrived a lot earlier than I expected.  The bangs are a bit long, but that can be easily fixed with styling!</li>
    <li> The wig came in a few weeks earlier than the ETA which is awesome. Its very nice quality, but its a lot longer than i expected. It can be fixed with styling and cutting.</li>
    <li> good wig in general, needed to style it quite a bit to make it match Levi&#x27;s look.</li>
    <li> Came very quickly (exactly a week) which is much much much quicker than the estimated date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself is in very good quality and looks realistic. However it has quite a bit of volume (like, the hair isn&#x27;t as flat as the picture shown) and lacks that undercut look in the back, which can be fixed by pinning it down. It also smells funny but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got the free wig cap as expected and also got a cute little keychain as a gift which was very sweet.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping (10 days!!) It came in perfect condition, very soft and silky but no in a bad way , it&#x27;s already styled and i was happy for that c: it came with a wig cap, the only bad thing is that it doesn&#x27;t look good on me :c it&#x27;s obiously not their fault, but i&#x27;ll try to make it look better on me with the make up on and the cosplay too and i don&#x27;t know how to put the wig on or the cap cause it&#x27;s my first cosplay so that&#x27;s probably, if i ever do cosplay again i&#x27;ll definitely buy from them again</li>
    <li> Wow. I love this wig! It works perfectly for Levi. I even scared my parents by saying that was my real hair...AND THEY BELIEVED ME. (so its like pretty much perfect. looks and feels like real hair.)</li>
    <li> Really good wig!&lt;br /&gt;Works great for Levi and John from Homestuck</li>
    <li> A good starter Levi wig but needs trimming and is very thick. Again I would only buy if you don&#x27;t need anything fancy but for professional cosplay this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing service. The expected delivery date was January 27. I ordered the wig on December 12 and it arrived two weeks.later. the quality of the wig was great, however, when I put on the wig it was too thick for a Levi wig. Nothing a little thinning couldn&#x27;t fix. I thinned the bottom layer to give the wig an undercut look just like Levi and trimming the bangs make the wig look much better. Just a little the advice.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price. If you take care of this it should last a while.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this wig at all, or at least the one I was given.&lt;br /&gt;First off, it looked nothing like the picture. The parting was off, and the back of the head was extremely poofy, which made it look like the hair was teased. Even when I tried to style it, it was impossible because of the poofiness of the back of the head. I still have the wig, but I never use it. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend, wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> i didnt  get what i paid for, i got a bob cut i tryed to fix it and messed up.&lt;br /&gt;im gonna buy from a different brand, i dont recomend getting it unless your majorly skilled at cutting wigs</li>
    <li> I bought this wig and I tried it on. It was tight but I think it was good because it can stay on. It is also very soft. XD It included a wig cap which I am very thankful for! I love it thank you! :)</li>
    <li> The wig came earlier than expected, which I&#x27;m very happy about.&lt;br /&gt;It is, however, a little too poofy but I&#x27;m sure that is fixable with styling.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super soft except for the weird feeling in the middle. It is sorta rough, but I&#x27;m sure that can be fixed as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> The wig is styled really well it held together really well.it is really worth it I can promise you that it is not something you will regret buying</li>
    <li> It was ok it didn&#x27;t really have that middle parting like Levi has but it was defiantly raven black which I liked for the most part...although I did turn it into a Haru cosplay from free but I ended up giving this wig to my friend so...cosplaying as Haru was just kinda for fun :)</li>
    <li> Wonderfully priced and great quality! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a nice wig, it came earlier than expected and was in good packaging. I can also tell that they tried to pre style it but one side didn&#x27;t stay but I don&#x27;t mind styling it at all its not that hard</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like the wig in the photo. It looks very thick and unnatural. This was being used for a Marco (Attack on Titan) cosplay. My kid said that the wig couldn&#x27;t even be styled.</li>
    <li> This wig is the right color for Levi&#x27;s hair and is an awesome wig for the price, but it does need a lot of trimming and thinning before it can be worn as Levi. (Photo is of the wig uncut and unstyled, fresh from the packaging).</li>
