      <li>it make my lips Smith shining for along time and the smill is delicious</li>
      <li>Awesome plumper.</li>
      <li>I think this gloss is best used alone rather than over lipstick as it has a tendency to disturb the color a bit.  </li>
      <li>This is great stuff!</li>
      <li>But for looks, it&#x27;s great, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to if you use it correctly!</li>
      <li>Wonderful glossy finish from this product!</li>
      <li>so I was very happy!!!</li>
      <li>but it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used great shine and plumps and smoothes my lips</li>

      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
      <li>Great price and works well.</li>
      <li>Great Product.  </li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>I took off one star because it is a bit sticky, so don&#x27;t go wearing it if you&#x27;re planning to do some kissing :-P</li>
      <li>Still the best &amp; have tried many plumpers</li>
      <li>I do not know how good for my body</li>
      <li>Word for the wise: don&#x27;t put it on over lipstick, lipgloss or chapstick.</li>
      <li>Good for the price.  </li>
      <li>Makes for a good lip gloss</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a good gloss</li>
      <li>It does plump your lips (a bit), but good conditioning formula.</li>
      <li>And it turns all my gorgeous matte lipstick into creme.  </li>
      <li>des work well as a gloss and tastes really good though</li>
      <li>I was upset but was happy to be able to order it here.</li>
      <li>so it looks great on top of any lipstick</li>
      <li>Very pleased</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
      <li>So in defense of this product that I find just downright amazing, think if it this way</li>
      <li>and I use it its amazing gloss</li>
      <li>I keep meaning to post a before and after photo, because this stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>if you want a nice shiny gloss that give you a tingling sensation, go for it.</li>
      <li>as a lip gloss it is nice, not sticky and has a calming scent; however as a plumper it did not work.</li>
      <li>I already had this product, and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>Nice gloss, just doesnt pucker or inflate my lips at all</li>
      <li>Good stuff :)</li>
      <li>It has a nice taste to it.</li>
      <li>There is a strong cinnamon taste, that&#x27;s not quite pleasant.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best lip gloss I have ever worn, and it makes me feel sexy!</li>
      <li>Smells very strong of cinnamon</li>
      <li>well most of the time.</li>
      <li>It is tingly, but not terrible and after a while I got used to it.  </li>
      <li>so you need to reapply it every 20-30 minutes to get more of that cinnamon flavored tingle that still doesn&#x27;t do anything to your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>AND I GUESS THAT BETTER THAN NOT</li>
      <li>AT ALL, SO I WILL PROBABLY BUY MORE OF IT.</li>
      <li>Also it could be more moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Recommend it for sure.</li>
      <li>Love the tingling sensation</li>
      <li>I will buy more.</li>
      <li>can put on top of any lipstick color you choose to wear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always love buying this product</li>
      <li>LOVE it,a girl at work stole this from my bag</li>
      <li>I cannot find it in any stores any more.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff,  I use it over matte lipstick or by its self.  </li>
      <li>I wear it alone or ontop of my favorite lip liner.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad this is still avialable</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff and have purchased 7 or 8 bottles over the years.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I love cinnamon</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments when I wear this gloss.</li>
      <li>I have medium-ish lips, anyway, but this helps them stand out even more.</li>
      <li>However, Sally Hansen smells great and the glossiness is nice enough.</li>
      <li>It works better than others but doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference with plumping my lips; however, I bought this more because a friend mentioned that it would help my lips feel smoother.  </li>
      <li>I love the smooth application and the cinnamon scent.</li>
      <li>Arrived in good condition and fast.</li>
      <li>Every time I wear it around my husband it comes right off!!</li>
      <li>Well, usually easy to find.  </li>
      <li>No need for lip injections, this product is easy and does the job.</li>
      <li>Not only do I end up with nice plumper lips, but you get that nice glossy shine as well :)</li>
      <li>The greatest benefit for me is that I use lip balm a lot less throughout the day when I apply this before my lip stick.  </li>
      <li>I first bought this stuff at a freakin&#x27; Job Lot, and love it, so when I ran out, I bought more on amazon.</li>
      <li>Be smart &amp; spend a bit more for a better product, like Too Faced or City.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked this product, but I recently discovered a lip balm with bee venom that is super softening, lightly tingly, and really feels &amp; looks good !</li>
      <li>Gangsta with it, Sally&#x27;s shelf space is secure.</li>
      <li>but I do enjoy the tingling sensation and taste.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Applicator is comfortable, does not burn.</li>
      <li>but since it is a plumping gloss, it draws the blood in your lips to the surface which gives your lips a gorgeous natural color even when the gloss is used by itself.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine tho, I use it anyway as a clear top coat. :-)</li>
      <li>The gloss is fun!</li>
      <li>i was really excited to get this product</li>
      <li>Nothing to yell about - I&#x27;ve used better lip pumpers in my time - this one wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
      <li>and my lips are super smooth and plump.  </li>
      <li>Just lip gloss, nothing special.</li>
      <li>but my husband loves the smell and my lips look so full when I wear.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff...doesn&#x27;t really do any plumping however I like the shine and that it does not have a sticky feeling</li>
      <li>THANKS :)</li>
      <li>I use a lip stain and put this over it and gives a nice shine and soft feel.  </li>
      <li>it really works I love how it tingles on my lips</li>
      <li>Works good, wish it would plump larger.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Results are guaranteed. They did not plump at all. I do feel the tingly sensation but it doesn&#x27;t plump at all sadly. Makes for a good lip gloss but that is it</li>
    <li> Get compliments all the time. I have medium-ish lips, anyway, but this helps them stand out even more. I adore the way it smells, too. Good stuff :)</li>
    <li> This was a product I read about online on Glo.  YES it does plump the lips right up.  Lights them up just like hot peppers do when I am silly enough to try one.  It has to be reapplied to continue to work all day, just like any lip product.  I&#x27;m not sure it really makes me look better... 60 something is going to remain 60 something after all.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip gloss I use to buy it at cvs for $10 can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore :( but it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used great shine and plumps and smoothes my lips</li>
    <li> The Seller was Awsome, But The product Its Self did not Plump my Lips Up That Much At All, I was looking for Something A little Bit more Stronger.</li>
    <li> Always loved this! Just can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. :(</li>
    <li> Just lip gloss, nothing special.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always love buying this product it really works I love how it tingles on my lips so I will always buy Sally Hansen lip plumper</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...doesn&#x27;t really do any plumping however I like the shine and that it does not have a sticky feeling</li>
    <li> Nice gloss, just doesnt pucker or inflate my lips at all</li>
    <li> This is terrible. It only lasts a few min before it&#x27;s gone and you need to re-apply. In addition... I didn&#x27;t feel that it plumped my lips at all. (you know if it tingles and stings then its working). I had high hopes because of all the good reviews, but I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have tried Sally Hansen&#x27;s other lip plumper product (with cinnamon in it) and thought it worked a little bit - so when I saw the \\&quot;Xtreme\\&quot; one by the same maker I expected the same or better results.  I saw and felt zero results.  I tried it a few times on different days and a few times in the same day - didn&#x27;t make a difference.  Basically it&#x27;s just a sticky lip gloss.  Very disappointed.  If you want to try this type of product, try the one with the cinnamon.</li>
    <li> Works good, wish it would plump larger.</li>
    <li> as a lip gloss it is nice, not sticky and has a calming scent; however as a plumper it did not work. I used it everyday for a month at least three times each day.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years and really like it.  Also makes your lips soft and tastes pretty good.</li>
    <li> I already had this product, and really liked it.  It&#x27;s clear which is really nice, and lasts a long time.  I use it pretty infrequently so when I do it&#x27;s a fun pop</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lip gloss I have ever worn, and it makes me feel sexy! Not only is it super  shiny (almost chrome like) but it makes your lips tingly... it increases blood flow to the lips making them appear plumper, and has a cinnamon like scent. Every time I wear it around my husband it comes right off!! Haha. Wear it with some lip liner and it takes on that slight color of the lip liner with a nice fade. I&#x27;ve worn this for years now.</li>
    <li> This is a temp plumper lasts about 3-4 hours. Not a long term plumper. Has a heavy feel initially but that diminishes about an hour later.</li>
    <li> Noticed slight plumping up of lips, minimal tingling, very thick and quite glossy, a bit difficult to apply matte lipstick coverage on top.</li>
    <li> Awesome plumper. Love the tingling sensation</li>
    <li> New in package  and it&#x27;s a good gloss just doesn&#x27;t do what it suppose to its said to be a intense  formula that pumps your lips  but nothing</li>
    <li> i was really excited to get this product bc I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a lip plumper. but this product did disappoint me. it did not plump my lips at all. after 5 mins of using this product i could only feel the tingling feeling but i saw no difference at all. the brush is nice and the gloss is shiny too, but as for the use of plumping, it was a failure. if you want a nice shiny gloss that give you a tingling sensation, go for it.</li>
    <li> It is basically just a lip gloss. I did not notice even a tiny bit of lip plumping.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference but I do enjoy the tingling sensation and taste.  I don&#x27;t plan to repurchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cinnamon flavored! I love cinnamon but this stuff does&lt;br /&gt;Not work</li>
    <li> Love it!! Still the best &amp; have tried many plumpers</li>
    <li> IT HELPS A LITTLE BIT AND I GUESS THAT BETTER THAN NOT AT ALL, SO I WILL PROBABLY BUY MORE OF IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years then it wasn&#x27;t in the local drug stores anymore. Big disappointment. So I looked online and thankfully amazon.com had it.  Nordstrom sells a way more expensive product similar but not near as good as this one.  I hope Sally Hansen does not discontinue this product.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I first bought this stuff at a freakin&#x27; Job Lot, and love it, so when I ran out, I bought more on amazon. It&#x27;s very glossy and has a cinnamon taste to it, and you can FEEL it plumping your lips: I notice a difference less than a minute after applying it. Don&#x27;t wear it over a lipstick, unless you&#x27;re not interested in the plumping, because it will only work if it has direct contact with your lips. I took off one star because it is a bit sticky, so don&#x27;t go wearing it if you&#x27;re planning to do some kissing :-P But for looks, it&#x27;s great, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to if you use it correctly!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff,  I use it over matte lipstick or by its self.  It really works and contains a generous amount of product for the money.</li>
    <li> I received it yesterday and I use it its amazing gloss I loooooove it its glossy not grassy it make my lips Smith shining for along time and the smill is delicious it just make me want to eat it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore and I&#x27;ve missed it. I love the smooth application and the cinnamon scent. My lips tingle and really shine when I wear it. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments when I wear this gloss. It is a bit sticky but not as bad as other products I&#x27;ve used. At least I don&#x27;t get that white line on the inside of my lips when I wear it all day. I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> Really does boost your lips but the effect is not long lasting.  It&#x27;s as long lasting as I think it is possible for these things to be though.  You will probably want to reapply often but take into consideration if that&#x27;s going to make any lipstick you have on underneath fade quicker.  I&#x27;m going to check out the colored versions of this next.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! I have used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;No longer available in stores, so online is only way to buy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product does not work on others. I know it works like a champ. I cannot find it in any stores any more. It was once sold at CVS. Regardless, this stuff really does work. I use it last after my nighttime beauty ritual. I wake up with very plump amd smooth lips. I apply in the morning and let it &amp;#34;marinate&amp;#34; for about 10 minutes before I blot it off and apply my regular lip color. I can&#x27;t survive with tout. Yes, it tingles, but it has to. It&#x27;s not an extreme, &amp;#34;OMG my lips are on fire&amp;#34; tingle, but just a slight stingy feeling. Get it. It rocks.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I loved that this stuff goes on really glossy, but the shine only lasts for about 30 minutes before I need another application. The lip plumping simply DOES NOT WORK! I have used other products, such as Too Faced, which actually plumped but was really burny. However, Sally Hansen smells great and the glossiness is nice enough.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff , too bad they don&#x27;t sell in stores anymore!!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a collagen injection, folks.  It&#x27;s cinnamon and ginger oil (in a matrix of scary chemicals) which causes a harmless, mild, not-unpleasant inflammation.  Some people are more sensitive to it than others.  The first time I used it, my lips felt slightly swollen and pouty, which was good for morale even if not noticeable to the uninformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The genius of this lip gloss is twofold:  it can go on thick and icy as a topcoat, or applied in a thin layer, it is the perfect base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a base coat, it makes color *last*.  And it turns all my gorgeous matte lipstick into creme.  Since no one wears serious matte lips anymore, and the stuff really is very drying, I&#x27;m thrilled that I can keep using my carefully preserved perfect-color-they-don&#x27;t-make-anymore lipsticks.  And I hope Sally Hansen never stops making this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not much more than a cinnamon infused lip gloss. You get what you pay for, and $13 is on the low end of lip plumbers, but really I&#x27;d just purchase a $4 tube of lip gloss if I wanted this effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applicator is comfortable, does not burn.</li>
    <li> This product is not what I was hoping for.  It is just a lip gloss that smells and tastes a bit like cinnamon.</li>
    <li> plumps overnight, burns but its working,  you will notice a difference</li>
    <li> It is like a lip gloss, have to reapply, but does not fade any wrinkles or plump up lips as promised. I won&#x27;t reorder and would not recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful glossy finish from this product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! I used to buy it at Walgreens all the time, but I can&#x27;t find it anymore. Everything Sally Hansen that I find now at local stores is unfortunately only hair removal or nail products :/ I swear by this stuff though enough to search it out online to buy it. I see a major difference when I use it in the plumpness of my lips. I usually use it as a topical treatment. I have read some reviews of ladies complaining about it not being that effective, but I also noticed a lot of them saying they applied lipstick after applying the lip inflation and letting it dry. So in defense of this product that I find just downright amazing, think if it this way: if you were to apply an SPF sunscreen 50 and then apply an SPF 15 sunscreen over it, the SPF 50 loses it&#x27;s effectiveness (and some say the 15 would just cancel it out completely as if you were just wearing 15). I can&#x27;t help but wonder if applying the lip inflation followed by something else that has no lip inflation qualities would decrease it&#x27;s effectiveness. I have a few different lipsticks/lip gloss colors that I use, and I always put them on FIRST and then follow that with the lip inflation gloss. Not only do I end up with nice plumper lips, but you get that nice glossy shine as well :) Hope this helps other ladies out!</li>
    <li> This product does not work PERIOD. Try Physicians Formula Plump Potion Needle-Free Lip Plumping Cocktail, Clear Potion, 0.1 Ounce It worked for me, at least better than this product but shipping was reasonable.</li>
    <li> Not a super plumper but kind to my lips, slight cinnamon scent is pleasant, and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff and have purchased 7 or 8 bottles over the years.  I would have given it 5 stars except that the price is way too high for the amount of product that you are actually able to get out of the bottle.  It does plump your lips (a bit), but good conditioning formula.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference with plumping my lips; however, I bought this more because a friend mentioned that it would help my lips feel smoother.  It is tingly, but not terrible and after a while I got used to it.  The greatest benefit for me is that I use lip balm a lot less throughout the day when I apply this before my lip stick.  Just wait ten or fifteen minutes before applying lipstick.  I also use without lipstick because it seems to make my lips a little pinker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad this is still avialable and I could buy some.  I have used it for quite awhile now and do like what it does to my lips.  I use a lip stain and put this over it and gives a nice shine and soft feel.  I think it plumps up my rather thin lips somewhat, anything helps and I like the flavor.</li>
    <li> This product is okay its very watery not as thick as the original sally Hansen lip plumper but It does the job</li>
    <li> Is just a lip gloss, no plumping at all. It des work well as a gloss and tastes really good though, just doesn&#x27;t work as a plumper</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t find it at RiteAid! so I was very happy!!!</li>
    <li> This product really works!  It only takes a few minutes for me to get fuller, shinier lips.  I use it after lip liner and lipstick.  No need for lip injections, this product is easy and does the job.</li>
    <li> Nothing to yell about - I&#x27;ve used better lip pumpers in my time - this one wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
    <li> Great price and works well. Lasts a very long time. Recommend it for sure. Smells very strong of cinnamon so beware if you have an allergy don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I got some tingling so I dont use it.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would work at least somewhat, but it does absolutely nothing. It&#x27;s just an overpriced clear lip gloss. Should not be promoted as lip plumping at all.</li>
    <li> You can feel this working, it does work and you can notice the difference, may require a few applications, and it tingles</li>
    <li> i had an allergic reaction</li>
    <li> Has a slight burning sensation - physicians formula makes your lips plumper. Figured I&#x27;d give this one a try.</li>
    <li> I buy this occasionally and it is very useful in plumping up my lips.  Some people find the &#x27;tingly&#x27; sensation irritating but I actually like it because it feels like it&#x27;s doing something.  I think this gloss is best used alone rather than over lipstick as it has a tendency to disturb the color a bit.  Also it could be more moisturizing.  But overall it did work for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I put it on every morning, when I start my beauty routine and by the time I a ready to apply my lipstick, I simply wipe what is left off and my lips are super smooth and plump.  It even makes my lips a little pinker.  If I&#x27;m in a rush, I&#x27;ll just swipe this on and head out the door.  I keep meaning to post a before and after photo, because this stuff is amazing.  The tube has also lasted a long time.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It works, but it works a bit too much. Kinda too tingly for comfort. There is a strong cinnamon taste, that&#x27;s not quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see much plumping, but use as a clear gloss instead. Was hoping for a fuller lip. Probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> LOVE it,a girl at work stole this from my bag she was so jealous of my lips..then I couldn&#x27;t find it retail again. I was upset but was happy to be able to order it here. It makes such a  difference.</li>
    <li> This lipgloss is a tingly wonder.  It provides lasting shine while offering a slight plumping action.  The sensation is unusual at first but you get used to it and it is worth it fior the results you achieve.</li>
    <li> There was no visible change in the fullness or plumpness of my lips. All I noticed was a very slight tingle.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle. I have been looking for this in stores but never see it. It def adds some volume to your lips along with shine. The only drawback is taste isnt so good so use a flavored lip gloss too..</li>
    <li> It works! Smells of cinnamon and peppermint, and stings just a bit. Nothing big, but more like the tingly-stingy sensation of peppermint. Word for the wise: don&#x27;t put it on over lipstick, lipgloss or chapstick. Those will act as a barrier and keep it from working (I know, because I tried and it didn&#x27;t work, but when I put it on by itself, I got the tingly-sensation and they got bigger).</li>
    <li> It works better than others but doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference</li>
    <li> Everything perfect, thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this product and I could never find it at local stores CVS WALL GREENS does not carry it any longer. It is a slight tingle and a cinnamon taste to it goes on clear can put on top of any lipstick color you choose to wear. All lip plumping lip gloss are expensive this one is just fantastic for the price.</li>
    <li> This product actually works to some degree. Good for the price.  Would buy again. Sally Hansen&#x27;s products work well most of the time.</li>
    <li> I like this...it may sting some people at first (like a hot cinnamon feeling). That just proves it&#x27;s working.  I have &amp;#34;lipstick&amp;#34; lines.  This product plumps those out, just about completely.  Give it a try if you have this problem...it&#x27;s inexpensive enough and you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and affordable.  I wear it alone or ontop of my favorite lip liner.  The gloss is fun!</li>
    <li> Waste of money. It did nothing for my lips except giving some shine and being super sticky. No Inflation at all.</li>
    <li> Im not to suprised with the results..or lack of. This doesnt do much to plump at all, its just a gloss with a little sting (as with all plumpers..theres usually a bit more). Be smart &amp; spend a bit more for a better product, like Too Faced or City. I wouldnt buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am kinda picky when it comes to lip gloss but this has become my new favorite. It is clear so it looks great on top of any lipstick but since it is a plumping gloss, it draws the blood in your lips to the surface which gives your lips a gorgeous natural color even when the gloss is used by itself. It&#x27;s a very thick consistency which I love and it smells like cinnamon. I love it!</li>
    <li> Had a little tingle but i didnt see a big difference. Wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I do not know how good for my body it is but my husband loves the smell and my lips look so full when I wear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a lip plumper before so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. When you apply it you feel some tingling at first.  It has a nice taste to it. I haven&#x27;t seen any plumping on my lips that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.  It&#x27;s fine tho, I use it anyway as a clear top coat. :-)</li>
    <li> THANKS :) I would order again! Great product. I really love the cinnamon scent and high gloss shine. Very pleased</li>
    <li> Great Product.  I use it for 20 minutes before putting on my lipstick and it puffs my lips.</li>
    <li> IN THE PAST I&#x27;VE PURCHASED LIP INFLATION FROM SALLY HANSEN FOR ABOUT HALF THE COST AND I LOVED IT!!  I DO NOT SEE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE LIP INFLATION AND LIP INFLATION EXTREME OTHER THAN TO COST.  I&#x27;M GOING BACK TO PURCHASING JUST THE LIP INFLATION FOR HALF THE COST.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other cheap-ish lip plumpers before, but was curious if any other brands had better results. In the interest of saving like $40 compared to some others on Amazon, I thought I&#x27;d try Sally Hansens Lip Inflation and was underwhelmed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a typical lip gloss that hides behind a very strong cinnamon taste in the hopes that the tingling from the cinnamon will trick you into thinking it&#x27;s doing something to your lips. It&#x27;s not doing anything. It&#x27;s a very sticky gloss that wears quickly so you need to reapply it every 20-30 minutes to get more of that cinnamon flavored tingle that still doesn&#x27;t do anything to your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money. Unless you&#x27;re into cinnamon, which you can get a cinnamon lip smackers from the drug store for $2.50. You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
    <li> Not worth it. I&#x27;ve used the other plumping lip glosses by Sally Hanson before and loved them. I was so sad when they stopped selling in stores! This one though I felt no difference and saw no difference and I thought it was supposed to be the more extreme one. :(</li>
    <li> Not a bad product - but the jury is still out s to whether or not it is working.  Arrived in good condition and fast.</li>
    <li> I didnt notice any plumping at all..</li>
    <li> doesnt plump your lips, smells gross, hate it. dont even waste your time nor money!!!</li>
    <li> awesome,my gf loved it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Goos price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this product, but I recently discovered a lip balm with bee venom that is super softening, lightly tingly, and really feels &amp; looks good ! called Active Bee Venom lip plumper from Australia. (bought on Amazon)  it was expensive for 10 grams but love it. lasts quite a while. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> I remember the good old days, when I could just walk into my local drugstore and grab a couple tubes of this. The clear because it can be worn under any added color of your choice, and a pink one for when two different lip products seems like too much work. Nice shine with a refreshing tingle, and leaves your lips soft and kissable for long after the glossiness fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a beauty staple that embodies Sally Hansen products in general...decent quality (never amazing but never pure crap either), consistent, and easy to find. *cough cough* Well, usually easy to find.  Every drug store I&#x27;d ever been to has an ample selection of Sally Hansen...talk about a monopoly when it comes to nail care and polish. Gangsta with it, Sally&#x27;s shelf space is secure. Some time within the past couple of years though the lip plumper stopped showing up in certain stores...the red bullseye let me down first, and Not-Wrong Aid followed suit after a while as well. A tedious search through the aisles left me empty handed, it seems like lip plumpers in general are more of a rarity these days. I blame the recession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Amazon and Coty Beauty are smart. They took this plain little drugstore lip plumper and slapped a Sephora-like pricetag on it. It was hard to pay 14.99 for something that I used to pay 7.49 for. Doubling the price! But I need a lip plumper so...shut up and take my money. Begrudgingly.</li>
