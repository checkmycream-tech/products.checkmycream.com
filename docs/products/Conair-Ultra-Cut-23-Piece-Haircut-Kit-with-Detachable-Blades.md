      <li>Price was perfect and dont use any batteries just electric which is nice.</li>
      <li>They work great for me.</li>
      <li>This is a great hair trimmer/cutter for guys like me with brush cuts or burrs that get cut at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He tells me the quality is great and does just what he needs.</li>
      <li>Great price, and the comb attachments allow for a great variety of cuts.</li>
      <li>Awesome n very light</li>
      <li>I received it on time and in good working condition.</li>
      <li>Good deal and a fair price.</li>
      <li>love it!  </li>
      <li>, i cut my own and mine isn&#x27;t thick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it is kind of a pain to have it plugged in while using.  </li>
      <li>because there is nothing better than this at that price,&lt;br /&gt;1st off</li>
      <li>Has worked great this whole time.</li>
      <li>Cuts even very fine hair, easy to use...</li>
      <li>I feel it is easy to use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update 6/12: still going strong.</li>
      <li>High quality product for a really good price.</li>
      <li>Pretty nice</li>
      <li>The shears are fine</li>
      <li>Seemed to be working great, but halfway into my first hair cut the whole front blade unit fell off.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it works just fine.  </li>
      <li>Frankly, if I needed more than a quick buzz, I&#x27;d still go to a pro.</li>
      <li>Its SUPER Lightweight!  </li>
      <li>it cuts really fine &amp; smooth</li>
      <li>Item works as advanced.</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>but it feels light and cheap.  </li>
      <li>and he loved his old one</li>
      <li>I was really excited about getting this for him now</li>
      <li>I wear a military-esque haircut, with a clean 1/4\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Included are some cheap scissors, a very useful brush, and a DVD showing how easy it is to do spectacular cuts that pros spend months learning how to do in school (!).  </li>
      <li>light weight, at first i didnt think it was quality, but the light weight allows me to cut my hair well...</li>
      <li>But 5 or 6 years with no maintenance (besides oiling the clipper part with the oil it comes with), not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Despite the low cost, I think you are better off with a better quality clipper.</li>
      <li>It was perfect on my neck, but the very coarse beard left a heavier stuble than before.</li>
      <li>This thing costs about as much as one professional haircut, does the job pretty well (not as good as a pro, but good enough for me).  </li>
      <li>Well when I received my first set of clippers I was excited to receive them until I opened them</li>
      <li>The make a very soft noise, which compared to others I have tried is no louder than the purr of a cat laying next to your head (cat lovers like me should understand, lol).</li>
      <li>I received these as a Christmas present, and so far they have been great.</li>
      <li>These go very cleanly right through it.</li>
      <li>so I thought I would get him the same brand just more pieces</li>
      <li>blade got hot after afew mins, it isn&#x27;t ceramic</li>
      <li>I love Conair products use it to cut the back of my neck and around ears and beard.</li>
      <li>I love this product came earlier than exspected</li>
      <li>I just wish I would have bought the same one that he had before instead of trying to get him one that had more pieces</li>
      <li>I had to grind through the rest of the scalping before I felt confident to go out in public.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully I can still get a few cuts in and break even money wise.</li>
      <li>These did not give as clean of a &#x27;no-attachment&#x27; cut as my old pair however for my beard.</li>
      <li>Based on the positive reviews I purchased this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is smooth, quick, and gives somehow a better cut then several other clippers tried.  </li>
      <li>The machine cuts my hair very great and seems to be working properly and very quiet compared to other haircut machines.</li>
      <li>Doesnt give a clean cut and cleaning neck barely got cut hairs leaving most of them long even on the lowest setting.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t be certain.</li>
      <li>Cheap ordinary clippers, but what do expect for the price...wish I would have spent more money on a more quality shaver</li>
      <li>Bought one brand new in early August 2013, I buzz my head once per week with no attachments and then clean and oil the blades before I put it away.  </li>
      <li>These cut so much faster and cleaner and quieter than the ones I had.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I got this as a gift for my husband because he cuts his hair so much he had a Conair before</li>
      <li>I am really upset that the person I told this to did not even check model numbers.</li>
      <li>During the summer, I sometimes clean shave the sides and back.</li>
      <li>realise the motor burning out on the first use is clearly an anomaly and not something that will happen often, yet</li>
      <li>I have never tried any high price clippers, I have always just bounced from one sub-$30 set to another.    </li>
      <li>It works very well so far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are a ton of plastic pieces, of which we use three (normal cut at 1/4 inch height, left ear, right ear).  </li>
      <li>However the most serious issue stemmed from the motor burning out on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: I took it apart and cleaned out the hair buildup, and it&#x27;s working almost like new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so i needed new ones.  </li>
      <li>These two tiny pieces of metal are permanently warped and will never allow the blade part to fit back into the shaver</li>
      <li>Well the first time he used it he said that the smallest blade the one that was supposed to be for your beard was too big and didn&#x27;t work,</li>
      <li>They pinch you some and shears wont trim my mustache like my old pair ,this  brand .Inferior</li>
      <li>A complete cut just took me ~3 minutes start to finish.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed, sending it back</li>
      <li>then his old one,</li>
      <li>Bought it by an accident but was surprised by the quality.  </li>
      <li>These really seem like they are well made and should hold up, although I&#x27;ve only had them for about a month</li>
      <li>, it is a motor drive, not magnetic motor, so no vibrations, at all.&lt;br /&gt;FAST ENOUGH, not the FASTEST, try ANDIS if you want the REAL POWER.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is pretty much a non-issue though as the clean cutting for me is only something I do to shorten my beard before shaving it if I decide to clean shave again.    </li>
      <li>It is a little loud, which concerned my toddler at first, but he got used to it.  </li>
      <li>I have two young boys, and I used to cut their hair several years ago but for some reason stopped.  </li>
      <li>Last one that last for 10 years was Conair and started to make very loud noise when I turned it on.  </li>

<li> The entire blade assembly fell out on first use and it&#x27;s impossible to get it back together again.</li>
<li> (you know early on in the movie series before it got ridiculous).  </li>
<li> he said he went over his head at least 10 times and it still left long hairs every where so he has to just cut it without the blade piece and just cut it</li>

    <li> Awesome n very light n it cuts really fine &amp; smooth</li>
    <li> To start things off, my needs are basic and so is my experience. I wear a military-esque haircut, with a clean 1/4\\&quot; (#2) cut on my entire head during the winter. During the summer, I sometimes clean shave the sides and back. I have never tried any high price clippers, I have always just bounced from one sub-$30 set to another.    I received these as a Christmas present, and so far they have been great. I have very thick and oily hair, which tend to either not get cut in the worst cases jam up many clippers I have tried. These go very cleanly right through it. The make a very soft noise, which compared to others I have tried is no louder than the purr of a cat laying next to your head (cat lovers like me should understand, lol). A complete cut just took me ~3 minutes start to finish. I use the provided apron as a cover for my sink to catch all the hair so there is no clean up.    These did not give as clean of a &#x27;no-attachment&#x27; cut as my old pair however for my beard. It was perfect on my neck, but the very coarse beard left a heavier stuble than before. This is pretty much a non-issue though as the clean cutting for me is only something I do to shorten my beard before shaving it if I decide to clean shave again.    Also, being an engineer... I dissect every machine I can. These really seem like they are well made and should hold up, although I&#x27;ve only had them for about a month so I can&#x27;t be certain.</li>
    <li> I have two young boys, and I used to cut their hair several years ago but for some reason stopped.  I asked for this trimmer for Christmas 2010 and tried it out the next day on my five and two year-old sons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!  It is a little loud, which concerned my toddler at first, but he got used to it.  It even comes with a lightweight plastic cape.  If you have boys / men in your house, you should buy one of these and save yourself some money!</li>
    <li> light weight, at first i didnt think it was quality, but the light weight allows me to cut my hair well...</li>
    <li> The best things in life are the simplest. Cheap. Works well. Gets the job done. And now I can spend money on something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for my husband, and later, 2 sons, for about 6 years. Has worked great this whole time. It&#x27;s not working so well lately - I think it needs to be sharpened. But 5 or 6 years with no maintenance (besides oiling the clipper part with the oil it comes with), not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I took it apart and cleaned out the hair buildup, and it&#x27;s working almost like new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/12: still going strong.</li>
    <li> I received it on time and in good working condition. I like how quiet it is and how lite weight it is. Does a decent job cutting the hair. I have it for two months and have no compliants.</li>
    <li> no issues, used weekly. works as described. thanks</li>
    <li> Seemed to be working great, but halfway into my first hair cut the whole front blade unit fell off. These two tiny pieces of metal are permanently warped and will never allow the blade part to fit back into the shaver well. This is a serious design flaw. Tried to fix it with a pair of pliers but this is only a temporary fix. Hopefully I can still get a few cuts in and break even money wise.</li>
    <li> Its SUPER Lightweight!  I had to actually get accustoming to holding it because it was that Lightweight.  It is also cuts perfectly with ease and precision!</li>
    <li> It works very well so far. I have no complaints. For the money i would say i am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this haircut kit by Conair 4 or 5 years ago. At last a long time considering I cut my hair a couple times a week so I bought it again!</li>
    <li> These hair clippers have all sorts of accessories which work great!!  After just one haircut, the clippers have paid for themselves!!</li>
    <li> Junk.  The entire blade assembly fell out on first use and it&#x27;s impossible to get it back together again.</li>
    <li> Well when I received my first set of clippers I was excited to receive them until I opened them and I realized they were not the ones I ordered. So I contacted Amazon and they were going to exchange them. I even told them they have the wrong Model #&#x27;s . I wanted HC221GBW and they sent me HCC221CSZ. They look totally different. The one I want has the (hair length) adjuster on side as well as the power button. The one that I received has the power button on front and adjuster on back. Well needless to say I was sent the same one (which was wrong to begin with).  I am really upset that the person I told this to did not even check model numbers. How many times do I have to get the wrong pair?</li>
    <li> This is the one to buy !!! Cuts even very fine hair, easy to use...</li>
    <li> I got it last month, and cut my hair myself in 2 times. I feel it is easy to use. I like it!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband because he cuts his hair so much he had a Conair before but it quit working and he loved his old one so I thought I would get him the same brand just more pieces then his old one, Well the first time he used it he said that the smallest blade the one that was supposed to be for your beard was too big and didn&#x27;t work, and then he tried cutting his hair with the middle piece he said he went over his head at least 10 times and it still left long hairs every where so he has to just cut it without the blade piece and just cut it so short he is almost bald I was really excited about getting this for him now I just wish I would have bought the same one that he had before instead of trying to get him one that had more pieces</li>
    <li> Cheap ordinary clippers, but what do expect for the price...wish I would have spent more money on a more quality shaver</li>
    <li> Bought it by an accident but was surprised by the quality.  It is smooth, quick, and gives somehow a better cut then several other clippers tried.  At some point, I tried to use it on a travel at 220 volts and it sustained rather long (as compared to another brand-named clipper), although of course it eventually burned.  I wish it was dual voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE TO AMAZON: it would help if Amazon could specify the voltage for things like these in technical details section.</li>
    <li> I love this product came earlier than exspected I love Conair products use it to cut the back of my neck and around ears and beard. Price was perfect and dont use any batteries just electric which is nice. so thank you</li>
    <li> Great motor on this thing.  Powers through even thick hair.  Great price, and the comb attachments allow for a great variety of cuts.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace an old set that had broken. These cut so much faster and cleaner and quieter than the ones I had. A+</li>
    <li> These work great!  I have pretty thick hair and my wife who is not a professional cuts my hair and I don&#x27;t have anymore problems with the clippers pulling my hair and such.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for the price you paid. They&#x27;re not top of the line but for the low price they don&#x27;t have to be. They work great for me.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice but it feels light and cheap.  It works for what it should do even though the cord is short, I had to attach an extension to use it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair cut kit for my husband.  He tells me the quality is great and does just what he needs.</li>
    <li> Bought one brand new in early August 2013, I buzz my head once per week with no attachments and then clean and oil the blades before I put it away.  Last week when I turned it on I knew something was not right because it sounded like a gas engine week eater and when I tried to cut my hair it felt like it was ripping each hair out, leaving my scalp looking a bit like Jason Vorhees from Friday the 13th (you know early on in the movie series before it got ridiculous).  I had to grind through the rest of the scalping before I felt confident to go out in public.  Waste of money if you are planning to use them regularly.</li>
    <li> Based on the positive reviews I purchased this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is not suitable for coarse hair, and it is rather noisy compared to my Forfex Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;2. The number of attachments are impressive, however the quality of the accessories is suspect.&lt;br /&gt;3. However the most serious issue stemmed from the motor burning out on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realise the motor burning out on the first use is clearly an anomaly and not something that will happen often, yet it is also a sign of serious quality control issues. I cannot recommend this item. Despite the low cost, I think you are better off with a better quality clipper.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace teh shears I had.  The shears are fine but I broke a bunch of the hair attachments so i needed new ones.  The only con about this is that it is wired (which I knew going into the purchase).  I didn&#x27;t think it would be that big a deal when i bought it but it is kind of a pain to have it plugged in while using.  Otherwise it works just fine.  I only cut my hair once every couple of months so i&#x27;m not using it a lot.</li>
    <li> Received it in a day and picked two day shipping! The machine cuts my hair very great and seems to be working properly and very quiet compared to other haircut machines. I recommend this product for a household.</li>
    <li> i put ***** because there is nothing better than this at that price,&lt;br /&gt;1st off, it is a motor drive, not magnetic motor, so no vibrations, at all.&lt;br /&gt;FAST ENOUGH, not the FASTEST, try ANDIS if you want the REAL POWER.&lt;br /&gt;it PULL a few times because of the lack of power, i cut my own and mine isn&#x27;t thick.&lt;br /&gt;the blade got hot after afew mins, it isn&#x27;t ceramic so can&#x27;t complain there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, you want this, if you only have $20 for a clipper.</li>
    <li> Item works as advanced. Powerful enough to cut thick hair yet quieter than other models. Good deal and a fair price.</li>
    <li> I used this to cut my husband and my son&#x27;s hair.  Last one that last for 10 years was Conair and started to make very loud noise when I turned it on.  This new one I got weight less than my previous one.  I have used it for a year by now.  Every month I cut hair for husband and son.  Instruction said I should oil the blade before, during, and after cutting hair so I followed it.  The oil came with the kit is very small so I order another big bottle of blade oil for about $5 with this kit at the same time at Amazon.</li>
    <li> this is like my 3rd clippers bought . They pinch you some and shears wont trim my mustache like my old pair ,this  brand .Inferior quality I guess . I would rerturn it but I think after shipping I get maybe half my money ..</li>
    <li> Lighter than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s technology for you. High quality product for a really good price. I would just say to read the instructions and follow them; You have to let the clippers do the work and even on me and my boys thick hair- it works great.</li>
    <li> oddly shaped hard to hold. Doesnt give a clean cut and cleaning neck barely got cut hairs leaving most of them long even on the lowest setting. Very dissapointed, sending it back</li>
    <li> I have frizzy grey hair and a beard, so I need to cut about once every 4 weeks or it looks really messy.  This thing costs about as much as one professional haircut, does the job pretty well (not as good as a pro, but good enough for me).  The problem?  My frizzy hair jams everything, so every few times it should be disassembled and cleaned out, requiring a screwdriver and some patience to re-assemble (the little metal pointers must be in the little plastic holes or the height adjustment doesn&#x27;t work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s held up for about 6 months so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a ton of plastic pieces, of which we use three (normal cut at 1/4 inch height, left ear, right ear).  Included are some cheap scissors, a very useful brush, and a DVD showing how easy it is to do spectacular cuts that pros spend months learning how to do in school (!).  Frankly, if I needed more than a quick buzz, I&#x27;d still go to a pro.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair trimmer/cutter for guys like me with brush cuts or burrs that get cut at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a pain in the butt to have to find and use an extension cord so the cord will reach the wall.</li>
