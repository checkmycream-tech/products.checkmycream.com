      <li>These are great on my hair and I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;To be fair</li>
      <li>I had been looking for a good boars hair brush and searched Amazon.</li>
      <li>but I prefer my smooth hair with nice volume over the maintenance of the perfect curl.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with it .</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I am in love with this brush!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This brush has become so precious that I won&#x27;t put it in checked luggage!</li>
      <li>This is a nice brush.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t blow out my hair often but the way this grips the hair and hits the scalp I think it will do quite nicely.</li>
      <li>Good brush, needs better reinforcement for the bristles.</li>

      <li>I have ordered 3 more</li>
      <li>Ok, buyers beware....</li>
      <li>A thicker one or a padded rubber handle would be more helpful.</li>
      <li>Love love love.</li>
      <li>I thought a boar brush would help to more evenly distribute the oils.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I came across this one.</li>
      <li>I love bore bristled brushes for blow trying my hair.</li>
      <li>Just like the one at the beauty supply but cheaper in price, love it</li>
      <li>More?</li>
      <li>It is perfect for my long, fine hair.</li>
      <li>The brush met my expectations and is easy to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it makes it easy to lose grip.  </li>
      <li>(Kind of like hot rollers)</li>
      <li>Brush is for fine hair.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous brush for styling and smoothing the hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Ok...does it make a difference if the wife loves them and the price is cheap?</li>
      <li>This is a great brush for blow drying fine or long hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brush is great for long hair and provides a really smooth finish.</li>
      <li>Pretty sure bristle would not melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Excellent round brush!</li>
      <li>Had this been a direct Amazon sale, based on what I&#x27;ve experienced with their return policy, they would have taken it back, no questions asked...along with a host of other companies/stores with amazing customer service, who value making their customers happy to ensure their continued patronage.</li>
      <li>the right amount of softness on your head!</li>
      <li>This is true for both of the brushes I have, so it is not a fluke of one brush.</li>
      <li>I have been straightening it since Jennifer Anniston forced us all to do so in the 90&#x27;s and let&#x27;s face it, my 80&#x27;s curls looked great when Top Gun came out</li>
      <li>Perhaps if I had really short hair that didn&#x27;t require so many hits with the hairdryer, it would work better.</li>
      <li>Makes hair soft and blows hair out easily!</li>
      <li>note, as I was about to heat up the bristles the wife says you&#x27;re not pulling more bristles out of the new brush are you?</li>
      <li>The Italian Boar Bristle does not fall out, and stays strong for many months of use.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my wife,  it is great for blow outs works like no other brush apparently.</li>
      <li>This is a great round brush.  </li>
      <li>If the handle were fatter, then it would be worth buying.</li>
      <li>It is the first time in my life my hair dries quickly /</li>
      <li>This brush is perfect for straightening my thick, naturally wavy, shoulder length hair.  </li>
      <li>but it is soft and easy on the hair.</li>
      <li>Brush works well although it is a bit soft- even with my fine hair.</li>
      <li>This brush works really well!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The thicker SHINY bristles looked suspicious when I first looked at them.</li>
      <li>First let me say this is the Cr&amp;egrave;me de le cr&amp;egrave;me of hairbrushes.  </li>
      <li>but this one make it more distributed making my blowout last longer.</li>
      <li>Always been pleased with wooden handle Boar bristle brushes and this one, too!!</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t fully help my hair, but it is much shinier and softer than it was before.</li>
      <li>fast delivery.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to stress out too much if they ever stop making it.</li>
      <li>The boar bristles are so much healthier for your hair than any prickly, spiky plastic brush.</li>
      <li>As an extremely picky brush selector, these are fantastic!</li>
      <li>My hair is long, fine and curly.</li>
      <li>They allow for more air flow and less damage to hair compared to ceramic brushes.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t particularly make my hair shiny though</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made from high quality materials.  </li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>How did I live 51 years on this earth without one?  </li>
      <li>The brush is harder to clean out but that is the case with all boat bristle brushes.</li>
      <li>The bristles are VERY soft.  </li>
      <li>I have long, fine hair (but lots of it) that takes a long time to blowdry straight.</li>
      <li>First time I used this brush with a blow dryer (low heat setting)</li>
      <li>I needed to know who this brush was by but the price sticker was covering the entire name all I gathered at first</li>
      <li>and then my hair is much more even as far as oils go, usually with other brushes my roots stay greasy quickly</li>
      <li>Did not like at all--bristles are too soft to use in my hair--and not an inexpensive brush.  </li>
      <li>even natural bristle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>no where does it say 100% boar bristle, or even 100% natural bristle...</li>
      <li>Even still the shiny plastic bristles far out</li>
      <li>was &#x27;ornette and naturally started googling Cornette.  </li>
      <li>number the natural looking ones.</li>
      <li>what do you mean more?</li>
      <li>I also like the simple classic style.</li>
      <li>but my grand daughter 17 with long hair uses it so killed 2 birds with one brush ..</li>
      <li>but it does a nice job smoothing out my waist long slightly thick hair.</li>
      <li>Spornette 855 grabs and pulls straight my long hair and gives volume at the roots.</li>
      <li>I have long fine hair, down to my butt</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love love love. Round brushing is all I got so  this brush is great</li>
    <li> Ok, buyers beware....what you get is not what&#x27;s shown in the picture. The bristles fall out after one use, AND in the picture the brush is shown with rows and rows of bristles, not what you actually get. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to replace a ceramic brush I was using because my hair had suddenly become very thick, almost, but not really, greasy. I thought a boar brush would help to more evenly distribute the oils. It didn&#x27;t fully help my hair, but it is much shinier and softer than it was before. I would recommend the change to anyone!</li>
    <li> The handle is narrow and slips in your hand when wet.  My hand gets cramps in them when I blow dry your hair.  The bristles are VERY soft.  I have fine, thick, and long hair.  It is impossible to use this brush without using a comb first.  This brush would only work for fine, short, and thin hair.</li>
    <li> As other reviews, the hanger is too little and makes drying your hair a very difficult and laborious task :(</li>
    <li> Very nice brush!  Thick, full and just  the right amount of softness on your head!</li>
    <li> This brush works really well!</li>
    <li> Did not like at all--bristles are too soft to use in my hair--and not an inexpensive brush.  I will not use this.</li>
    <li> The handle on the brush is very thin which makes the brush hard to hold when pulling through your hair.  Would not recommend this product.  If the handle were fatter, then it would be worth buying.</li>
    <li> Some brushes are too dense to get through your hair, but this is perfect.  It reaches my scalp &amp; allows me to brush &amp; sculpt my hair.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever!! Makes hair soft and blows hair out easily!</li>
    <li> I love bore bristled brushes for blow trying my hair. They allow for more air flow and less damage to hair compared to ceramic brushes. This is the second brush of this brand and size. The pervious one lasted several years and I think this one will too. I also like the simple classic style.</li>
    <li> Did not realize how very long these bristles are. My fault for not visualizing better. Brush is for fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for blow drying fine or long hair.&lt;br /&gt;However, the handle is too small in diameter. It needs a&lt;br /&gt;large rubber piece put around it for gripping as it slips out of my hands very easily.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for many years to replace my hairbrush with the 3 inch diameter and this one works great for me!!!!!</li>
    <li> Several years ago I had a hairdresser buy a brush for me because I couldn&#x27;t find what I was looking for.  She brought me this one (at approx. $30/brush).  At first I wasn&#x27;t a fan because I, like other commentors, thought the handle was a little too narrow.  However, after using this brush I became hooked!  I recently decided to dump all my other brushes and replace them with this one.  I found these on Amazon at half the price and I bought four, three to stash in different locations and one serves as a backup.  These are great on my hair and I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  As an extremely picky brush selector, these are fantastic!</li>
    <li> but my grand daughter 17 with long hair uses it so killed 2 birds with one brush ..but the dog doesn&#x27;t like to share</li>
    <li> The brush met my expectations and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t particularly make my hair shiny though but it is soft and easy on the hair.</li>
    <li> These bristles were made of plastic, I returned it.</li>
    <li> It is the first time in my life my hair dries quickly / It is the best brush I have ever bought. My hair is thin and not long , this helps me dry it and style it quickly . I am very satisfied with it . When this get ruined , I will buy another one.</li>
    <li> First time I used this brush with a blow dryer (low heat setting) the bristles became bent and piece broke off. I do not have very thick hair. This is not a good brush for styling at all.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this style brush for many years from Spornette because it works perfectly  by letting her style with ease. The Italian Boar Bristle does not fall out, and stays strong for many months of use.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Spornette #855 brush for 12 years and I can&#x27;t live without it. My hair is long, fine and curly. I have been straightening it since Jennifer Anniston forced us all to do so in the 90&#x27;s and let&#x27;s face it, my 80&#x27;s curls looked great when Top Gun came out but I prefer my smooth hair with nice volume over the maintenance of the perfect curl. This brush has long bristles and they are spaced out enough to let the hair dry. Air moves better through it as you blow dry allowing the hair shaft to straighten with heat and close when you cold blast. Brushes, no matter how big the barrel, with tight bristles create the worst frizz and I end up looking like Rosana Rosana Dana. Spornette 855 grabs and pulls straight my long hair and gives volume at the roots.This brush has become so precious that I won&#x27;t put it in checked luggage! The boar bristles are so much healthier for your hair than any prickly, spiky plastic brush. I have ordered 3 more so I don&#x27;t have to stress out too much if they ever stop making it.</li>
    <li> I had owned this brush for a good 3 years and left it in a hotel room :( I immediately ordered another one because I knew of its quality and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for round brushing my shoulder length hair. Washes beautifully and I&#x27;ve never lost a bristle. Excellent round brush!</li>
    <li> If these bristles are boar, then I&#x27;m a nauga&#x27;s uncle. Look like plastic to me...expensive plastic if not boar bristle. I will be inspecting these more closely when I have a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If plastic I will complain to Amazon and get back to you on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/14/14: In my Forensics Lab the next day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, my wife LOVES these two brushes! However, upon close examination they are not 100% boar bristle, in fact they are not 100% even natural bristle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thicker SHINY bristles looked suspicious when I first looked at them. Thick, stiffer and shiny says plastic to me. I pulled a few out and heated them up over a candle and they melt just like plastic would. Pretty sure bristle would not melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said there ARE other bristles in there that look natural and may in fact be boar or piglet or whatever. Even still the shiny plastic bristles far out number the natural looking ones. I wouldn&#x27;t even say they are 50/50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair no where does it say 100% boar bristle, or even 100% natural bristle...but to me it&#x27;s still misleading to state \\&quot;boar bristle\\&quot; (which at 15 bucks would be a steal) - it should be touted as perhaps \\&quot;contains a small amount of boar bristle\\&quot; or even \\&quot;these brushes are manufactured on machines that also produce boar bristle brushes\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok...does it make a difference if the wife loves them and the price is cheap? Ethically/morally to me...Yes, but...there you go with that relative moralism. Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last note, as I was about to heat up the bristles the wife says you&#x27;re not pulling more bristles out of the new brush are you? More? No...only one or two...what do you mean more? Oh, she says...the brush loses bristles every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ARGGG..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You decide...I&#x27;m on the fence. Hope this helps you.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife,  it is great for blow outs works like no other brush apparently.</li>
    <li> Not a boar brush, too expensive. Buy only if you have long or very curly hair. Also the brush bristles are too soft for my hair and the handle is not easy to hold, nothing to grip on to.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great boar bristle brush for some time now. I am so glad I came across this one. It is perfect for my long, fine hair. This brush also cuts down on the time I have to straighten my hair as well due to it taming the frizz while blowdrying.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for straightening my thick, naturally wavy, shoulder length hair.  My only negative is the handle.  It&#x27;s so thin and smooth it makes it easy to lose grip.  A thicker one or a padded rubber handle would be more helpful.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for home and one for the station where I work and sleep a few nights each week. Brush works well although it is a bit soft- even with my fine hair. However, the bristles fall out! Every time I dry my hair, there are at least 5-7 bristles on the sink/floor of my bathroom. This is true for both of the brushes I have, so it is not a fluke of one brush. Good brush, needs better reinforcement for the bristles.</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush. Not all boar bristles perhaps but it does a nice job smoothing out my waist long slightly thick hair. Never gets snarled or stuck like with the vented round brushes. I did notice one or two bristles that came out at the beginning, but none since. I don&#x27;t blow out my hair often but the way this grips the hair and hits the scalp I think it will do quite nicely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for over 10 years.  Still works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made in Italy people!</li>
    <li> This brush is great for long hair and provides a really smooth finish. Blow drying the hair with a round brush can be very damaging especially depending on the type of brush but since these are boat bristles it really helps to cut down on the damage. I&#x27;m a stylist who works on other peoples hair and at time the brush seems a little un-ergonomical and hurts my wrist because it&#x27;s so big which could be alleviated with perhaps a soft cushioned handle. The brush is harder to clean out but that is the case with all boat bristle brushes.</li>
    <li> Great quality, exactly what I wanted!!</li>
    <li> Excellent for polishing hair with ergonomic handle.&lt;br /&gt;As a reference we can say that the bristles are of medium hardness.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the brush I received was not the same quality as the brush I was trying to replace.  They were the exact same brand &amp; model number (printed on the brush handle), but when I used this one the first and only time, the bristles were not as stiff as the ones on the one I already had, and in turn, it made my hair too \\&quot;static-y\\&quot; to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my attempt to return the brush, I contacted the seller.  Though the return policy loosely defines that beauty products can only be returned in new condition, I was extremely disappointed that the seller would not honor a refund to an unhappy customer, because the item I received was not the item I thought I had ordered.  Had this been a direct Amazon sale, based on what I&#x27;ve experienced with their return policy, they would have taken it back, no questions asked...along with a host of other companies/stores with amazing customer service, who value making their customers happy to ensure their continued patronage.</li>
    <li> This is a great round brush.  It&#x27;s made from high quality materials.  Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive as I like to use several in my hair at once (Kind of like hot rollers)</li>
    <li> I purchased the big one..disappointed.... the handle is way to small I just does not understand... usually italian products are well made ... not this. I am italian and will write to the company.</li>
    <li> When I first received this brush, I was skeptical that the bristles are even real boar hair. They feel like plastic, but after using the brush a few times, they have softened some and are now resembling the other boar bristle brush I have. As other reviewers stated, the handle is awkward and uncomfortable to hold. I have long, fine hair (but lots of it) that takes a long time to blowdry straight. I was hoping these bristles would be gentler on my delicate hair, but instead I wound up little random broken hairs poking out all over the place. I went back to the ceramic round brush after attempting several times to dry my hair with this brush. It&#x27;s just not good for my hair. Perhaps if I had really short hair that didn&#x27;t require so many hits with the hairdryer, it would work better.</li>
    <li> First let me say this is the Cr&amp;egrave;me de le cr&amp;egrave;me of hairbrushes.  I found this ugly lightweight gem in my drawers and used it on my bob that is growing out never thinking it would do anything as I needed to smooth out the flippant and unruly and uneven ends.  All of a sudden, voila, I go from choppy to smooth and inviting hair in literally seconds.  I needed to know who this brush was by but the price sticker was covering the entire name all I gathered at first was &#x27;ornette and naturally started googling Cornette.  Thank goodness for Amazon Prime!  I am in love with this brush!  I literally cannot wait for my next hair washing and something that never thrilled me before.  Now that I found Spornette International I am going to be investing in other Spornette hairbrushes from Amazon and the price is so inexpensive compared to the end result.</li>
    <li> love this product.  fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Too much nylon monofilament mixed in with just a few boar bristles. Was expecting a boar bristle brush per the listing. Had to return it.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I have had one for 10+years. Was time to replace it! Nothing compares to the boar bristles!</li>
    <li> Always been pleased with wooden handle Boar bristle brushes and this one, too!!</li>
    <li> I would not recomend this product. It did fall apart after only 10 uses. It is not a good brand.</li>
    <li> Big enough, so you don&#x27;t have to spend too much time drying your hair. Gives your hair great body and doesn&#x27;t pull your hair.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a good boars hair brush and searched Amazon. Turns out this was also awarded the best brush for blowouts and has great reviews everywhere. they didn&#x27;t lie, this brush is great. I have long fine hair, down to my butt and this brush goes through it like silk and then my hair is much more even as far as oils go, usually with other brushes my roots stay greasy quickly but this one make it more distributed making my blowout last longer.</li>
    <li> Just like the one at the beauty supply but cheaper in price, love it</li>
    <li> Awful awful awful! This brush came with the bristles already coming out and running your hands through the brush tons of plastic (non boar bristles) fall out. This is not authentic. Buyers beware!</li>
    <li> Must have!  How did I live 51 years on this earth without one?  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous brush for styling and smoothing the hair.  It&#x27;s lightweight too.  Love it!</li>
