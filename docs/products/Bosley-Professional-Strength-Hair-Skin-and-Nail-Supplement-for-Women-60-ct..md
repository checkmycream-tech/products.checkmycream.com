      <li>So far, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be doing any good --</li>
      <li>Really works!!!.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it, it really does work !!!</li>
      <li>did nothing for me found product that really works in a week!!!</li>
      <li>My hair is also very soft and feels healthier, I do use this supplement along with the Bosley shampoo, very pleased with both.</li>
      <li>I highly recommended I am so satisfied love</li>
      <li>My Bosley vitamins for women weren&#x27;t original Bosley products.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased so far.</li>
      <li>You also have to be very consistent with this.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s growing my hair back nicely</li>
      <li>Right now my hair grows about 1/2\\&quot; per month.    </li>
      <li>I rated it a 3 right now because I do not know the results yet.</li>
      <li>I know the product isn&#x27;t right.</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>I must admit that I am on my third month of the Toji vitamins and am experiencing better results.  </li>
      <li>Her hair is growing for the first time in years.</li>
      <li>just finished my first bottle.</li>
      <li>This product really works!  </li>
      <li>I will not be purchasing the second bottle for sure.</li>
      <li>I will write a review about it after I go through the first bottle.</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin hair and when I take these daily even my hairstylist can see the new growth and is impressed.</li>
      <li>Not as much hair loss.</li>
      <li>Another girl at the salon had 2\\&quot; of hair growth in one month (I saw it for myself), which is what really convinced me to order the vitamins.    </li>
      <li>Has worked really well.  </li>
      <li>They were promptly delivered and reasonably price.</li>
      <li>These really do the trick.</li>
      <li>My nails also began to grown much quicker than before</li>
      <li>Not to mention my fingernails are long and strong.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend but remember it does not work for everyone.</li>
      <li>Toji is more expensive but if they work better then it is worth the extra price.</li>
      <li>The pills are a little large but have a coating that makes them easy to swallow.</li>
      <li>I also took pictures to see how much my hair was growing about every 2 weeks and with the Bosley, my hair didn&#x27;t grow nearly as noticeably as with the Purvana.</li>
      <li>and I can see some new growth coming in.</li>
      <li>I am 85% gray and color my hair dark brown, so I can easily see how much my hair is growing since I only get a touch up every 4 weeks.</li>
      <li>vitamins which helped my hair grow back really fast, almost an inch ever couple of months</li>
      <li>So far it has made my hair healthier, but I have not seen any difference in the bald spots.</li>
      <li>However, with the Bosley, I would cut them 1 day and then need to cut them again a few days later, so I felt that the Purvana made my hair grow much more than the Bosley.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product before, and the results proved positive for my thin, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>The  color of the pill was not right, the pill is smooth this pill was rough and Bosley vitamin always has expiration date on bottom of container this container had nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Am only on my second bottle of these hair vitamins, but within the first couple weeks my hair was shinier, less frizzy and manageable....</li>
      <li>Myself and my roommate started to see a difference in my third week but not much yet, I was told its a long process, so I&#x27;m ready to get that second bottle.</li>

<li> I remember taking this product a few months back.</li>
<li> Ive been diligently taking these for over 2 months and aside from some acne got absolutely no change to my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product really works!  My hair felt stronger and healthier just after 2 weeks of taking this supplement once a day.</li>
    <li> Hair stopped falling out, and nails are super awesome!</li>
    <li> Has not seemed to cause any hair regrowth, but am keeping what I have. I am 87 and cannot expect miracles</li>
    <li> I had great success with the Bosely shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair, so I decided to order the vitamins. I have heard very good reviews about them at the salon. My stylist has been using them to treat her alopecia for over a year with good results. Another girl at the salon had 2\\&quot; of hair growth in one month (I saw it for myself), which is what really convinced me to order the vitamins.    I will update my review in a month and let everyone know if I saw any type of accelorated growth or change in quality of my hair. I am 85% gray and color my hair dark brown, so I can easily see how much my hair is growing since I only get a touch up every 4 weeks. Right now my hair grows about 1/2\\&quot; per month.    I rated it a 3 right now because I do not know the results yet.</li>
    <li> These vitamins are great! My nails And hair are noticeably stronger.</li>
    <li> did nothing for me found product that really works in a week!!!</li>
    <li> Helps hair and nails grow quickly and healthy.</li>
    <li> Along with using the shampoo, conditioner, and also the regrowth treatment it&#x27;s been working for me. I&#x27;ll keep using it, it really does work !!!</li>
    <li> I love it! It really works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken a couple bottles. My nails aren&#x27;t stronger and no change that I can see in my hair.</li>
    <li> delivered on time.  Was as expected.  Will see how it works.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to anyone 18and up. Its great for hair growth and nails. I&#x27;ve also notice I tend to have clearer skin and no breakouts at all to anything when I take them. Still continuing to buy.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great item.  It&#x27;s growing my hair back nicely and I will buy it again.  I loss my hair from stress and I had a couple of bald spots.  NOT any more, again Great</li>
    <li> My hair has started to grow after a few weeks of using this product. My hair has also thickened. this product works</li>
    <li> This transaction was excellent in every way, price, shipping rates and time taken, quality. I have only been taking the supplement about 2 weeks, so I cannot address its effectiveness yet. Quality seems excellent.</li>
    <li> These vitamins are okay and I did not find anything really wrong with them.  I must admit that I am on my third month of the Toji vitamins and am experiencing better results.  Toji is more expensive but if they work better then it is worth the extra price.</li>
    <li> Myself and my roommate started to see a difference in my third week but not much yet, I was told its a long process, so I&#x27;m ready to get that second bottle. One thing I did notice is my hair is stronger and shinier :)</li>
    <li> My Bosley vitamins for women weren&#x27;t original Bosley products.  The  color of the pill was not right, the pill is smooth this pill was rough and Bosley vitamin always has expiration date on bottom of container this container had nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying for years a I know the product isn&#x27;t right.</li>
    <li> Great delivery. Great product.</li>
    <li> Ive been diligently taking these for over 2 months and aside from some acne got absolutely no change to my hair. Its expensive as well, I would just stick to plain ol&#x27; biotin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and love it.. It works great!! Will continue using this product!!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT SEEM TO ME IS FEAKE&lt;br /&gt;I USE BEFORE AND I LIKE BUD THIS ONE WAS DEFERENT</li>
    <li> So far so good, my nails are stronger and my hair is fuller , my skin looks much better and it just works</li>
    <li> I could not tell that the hair supplements helped with my hair. The regrowth treatment did help but  did not order any more of the supplements.</li>
    <li> I like the results in my nails and hair.  was using another product but like the price and results better with the Bosley. I have recommended it to several of my friends that have the same issue as me.</li>
    <li> I remember taking this product a few months back. A friend of mine suggested this to help my hair loss and after a month I saw little hairs starting to grow and my other hair became a lot softer and stronger.  it does take time, so don&#x27;t get frustrated. Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> Did nothing. Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before, and the results proved positive for my thin, fine hair.  Am looking forward to continuing making future purchases of Bosley products.</li>
    <li> Have been taking this supplement for 30 days and am quite impressed with how it&#x27;s positively affected my skin, it appears smoother. My hair is also very soft and feels healthier, I do use this supplement along with the Bosley shampoo, very pleased with both.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair growth, for the price not really a good product. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle but some hair growth. I&#x27;m almost finished with the bottle and will not be ordering anymore. For the price you only get 60 tablets and you take them twice a day. It can get pretty expensive using this product, and without achieving any results it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
    <li> i will continue to purchase&lt;br /&gt;quality item and i can see the results&lt;br /&gt;super happy with the price as well&lt;br /&gt;love love love</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with hair loss for a while and the only hair growth you&#x27;ll get is in other places where you dont want it.</li>
    <li> I need to buy another bottle. I was no constant with it.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with hair loss after surgery and this helped immenseyl</li>
    <li> I had a little tummy trouble with this product and could not finish the bottle, in all fairness this just could have been my body and not the supplement</li>
    <li> just finished my first bottle. This product did not work for me. My nails are as usual, the hair is shedding a bit, grows out like normal. I will not be purchasing the second bottle for sure. Prior to Bosley I used Shen Min hair nutrient - I liked it a lot. But after I read that it gives side effects on liver I stopped using it. Though it was very good. Now I am on Toji. Hope it works..</li>
    <li> So far, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be doing any good -- but I guess time will tell...I&#x27;ll keep taking the supplement.</li>
    <li> Not the best, didn&#x27;t see results.</li>
    <li> I have not seen fast, dramatic results.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the liquid products as well.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder the vitamins again.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, new product, great job!!!</li>
    <li> After chemo I used a similar product which after a while stopped my hair from falling out but I was looking for more; fullness. I tried this brand and my hair started falling out again. I have since tried another brand and immediately my hair stopped falling.</li>
    <li> While this product helps your hair to grow, it didn&#x27;t thicken my hair which is what I needed. My nails also began to grown much quicker than before but I also need to thicken them as well. I recommend this product to those whose hair is falling out.</li>
    <li> I am growing out my hair after a terrible dye and perm experience so I bought this after my Purvana ran out. I am experimenting trying different hair growth vitamins. I gave this 2 stars because I felt that the Purvana worked better than the Bosley. With the Purvana, I would cut my nails 1 day and then the next I had to cut them again. However, with the Bosley, I would cut them 1 day and then need to cut them again a few days later, so I felt that the Purvana made my hair grow much more than the Bosley. I also took pictures to see how much my hair was growing about every 2 weeks and with the Bosley, my hair didn&#x27;t grow nearly as noticeably as with the Purvana. I won&#x27;t buy this again. I bought Hairfinity next to try it. I will write a review about it after I go through the first bottle.</li>
    <li> I can see small hairs growing, but my hair does not feel thicker. You also have to be very consistent with this. I can tell a difference in growth if I miss even a day of taking it.</li>
    <li> Love the vitamins &amp; my hair is growing</li>
    <li> Great vitamins! They help with hair growth and energy for me. I would recommend them to anyone thinning. Great prices and fast shipping on amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product...after 1 month, more hair loss!!;</li>
    <li> Am only on my second bottle of these hair vitamins, but within the first couple weeks my hair was shinier, less frizzy and manageable....also by my second month I see growth....didn&#x27;t think anything would ever work! Will keep ordering these. Not to mention my fingernails are long and strong.</li>
    <li> I just started using it for about 2 weeks and I can see some new growth coming in. so i give it another couple months and I&#x27;ll write another review</li>
    <li> I use this product because my hair is very thin and am losing hair.  It is doing what it is supposed to do but I would prefer to take only one pill a day.  This product requires you take it 2 times a day.  I would recommend it if a person doesn&#x27;t mind taking it 2 times a day.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I have bald spots because of radiation on my scalp. So far it has made my hair healthier, but I have not seen any difference in the bald spots. My Radiologist said that the bald spots might not ever get hair again. So I guess just getting healthier hair is all I can hope for.</li>
    <li> It was alright all body hair grows faster then the actually head hair :/&lt;br /&gt;...........................&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it would work for some one else&lt;br /&gt;We all have different bodies</li>
    <li> Has helped my hair get thicker</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! ❤️</li>
    <li> I Love it my Hair has grown</li>
    <li> Really works!!!. A lot of my hair fell out after taking medication but this product grew it all back and then some. My hair is thicker now and healthier and all those around me noticed.  It stopped my hair from falling out. Unfortunately it is a case to case basis as many of my male and female friends tried it after seeing my results but it did not work for everyone. I used this together with the starter set and i also took &amp;#34;hairfinity&amp;#34; vitamins which helped my hair grow back really fast, almost an inch ever couple of months, it speeds up the hairgrowth so fast that you will notice a difference after four weeks!!!! Highly recommend but remember it does not work for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this supplements many times and have always been satisfied with the product and the results. Unfortunately, the last bottle,although far from expiration, had pills with brown spots. It might have been oxidation but I had no way of telling. I contacted the company and their representative was poorly trained and offer no answers. I question the quality control of this product.</li>
    <li> Brand new and arrived in great time.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> When I turned 50, I noticed my hair and nails were just not as healthy as they once were. Surprise, surprise. Mentioned my concerns to my hairdresser, of all people, and he suggested this product. Taken over time, you have to stay faithful to it. It has improved my hair (a lot less hair loss) and my nails (less ridges and stronger). It seems to help me, too, with my energy level.</li>
    <li> Great product that really help you hair to grow, look thicker and healthier.  I even notice my eye lashes is growing.</li>
    <li> Swear by this stuff! Great for after you have hysterectomy!</li>
    <li> These vitamins are incredible and do a great job of keeping your hair healthy and full.  They were promptly delivered and reasonably price.</li>
    <li> I HAVE VERY FINE HAIR AND NOTICED I STARTED THINNING ON TOP. SO I STARTED TAKING EVERYTHING I COULD GET MY HANDS ON. SO I USED THE BOSLEY VITAMINS, BOSLEY SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITIONER, AND BOSLEY THICKENING TREATMENT.  I HAVE NOTICED SOME IMPROVEMENT. CANT SAY THAT THIS ALONE WOULD WORK BECAUSE I HAVENT TAKEN THEM ONLY WITHOUT OTHER PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> I love this product my hair is stronger n it&#x27;s growing . I highly recommended I am so satisfied love this</li>
    <li> My daughter heard about this from a friend who had been using it for a year, we decided to try it. It has been a month and we both are having less hair loss. Her hair is growing for the first time in years. I have short hair and now need a haircut every 3 weeks instead of 4.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle of Bosley vitamins and I can definitely see an improvement with my hair.  My hair looks healthier and doesn&#x27;t easily fall out.</li>
    <li> It gave me migraine headaches. But it works.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s working yet. I know the pills sure are cleaning my system out if my hair isn&#x27;t getting thicker and fuller. I will have to update later.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working for me will continue to buy</li>
    <li> did not help.. used 2 months</li>
    <li> t6hese vitamins replenish the hair and i strongly recommend it to anyone who suffers from thinning hair. If you want to see a change, this product can do it for you</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t taken it long enough to say whether it is working or not. The pills are a little large but have a coating that makes them easy to swallow. I will purchase another bottle.</li>
    <li> Has worked really well.  I have seen a difference in my hair. Not as much hair loss. Very pleased so far.</li>
    <li> I used up one bottle along with using almond oil on my hair to prevent breakage. I did not notice a difference in growth. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I like the results that I get from this product. Would recommend it to women who also share my hair problems.</li>
    <li> These really do the trick. I have fine, thin hair and when I take these daily even my hairstylist can see the new growth and is impressed.</li>
    <li> NOT IMPRESSED AND I DON&#x27;T BELIEVE THESE DID ME ANY GOOD AT ALL. NO LONG-TERM CUSTOMER FOR THESE THINGS HERE.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell</li>
