<ol>
      <li>This is amazing!!!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This stuff is great, goes on</li>
      <li>*Would be great for a darker tone person; but I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I did not just slap some of this gel on my face!</li>
      <li>I am an experienced self tanner by the way, and the left side was flawless, think I maybe prefer the lotion to the spray?</li>
      <li>I have gotten streaks before with this but as soon as I took a shower it came right off!!!</li>
      <li>Make sure and use the gloves that are included in the box</li>
      <li>Make sure to exfoliate and leave it on for the recommended time</li>
      <li>Definitely the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and will continue to use!</li>
      <li>I love this product.......</li>
      <li>I also love that when you put it on, it doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin for days and start to get blotchy.</li>
      <li>I have gotten so many compliments on my tan.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>Usually I love their products</li>
      <li>and it is even better than SUN brand.</li>
      <li>.....delivers nice, rich color.  </li>
      <li>I also noticed that this rubs off easily so be prepared.  </li>
      <li>but you can easily rub it in.</li>
      <li>Does not smell as strong as the original lotion formula.</li>
      <li>That would of been a huge mistake.</li>
      <li>By the time I am done applying to my whole body, the place I started with it is already darker!!!</li>
      <li>but they came right off with some water, no scrubbing at all!</li>
      <li>we&#x27;ll and very pretty color.</li>
      <li>I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND putting on lotion before this because it is much easier to rub in.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this to anyone !!!  </li>
      <li>It looks funny when you put it on, but it does not streak and everyone compliments my tan!  </li>
      <li>Very easy to apply and instant color.</li>
      <li>lotion is much more forgiving, I did apply the lotion on the left side of my body, the gel to the right.</li>
      <li>If you really take time and are very careful you will get good results.</li>
      <li>This one definitely gives the most natural color and I love that it doesn&#x27;t give such a strong scent.</li>
      <li>At first I thought this was like a lotion</li>
      <li>When you first put it on.</li>
      <li>Make sure your skin is not overly dry as it will absorb to fast.  </li>
      <li>Wear the gloves and rub in fast.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using all three products and after one use I look like so much darker</li>
      <li>It is also very sticky.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to apply to your whole body.</li>
      <li>but I really think they just missed the mark with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is HIGHLY pigmented, fast drying gel.</li>
      <li>But I highly recommend the liquid, much easier.</li>
      <li>I would definitely not recommend for beginners to self tanning as another reviewer stated you must work rather quickly to rub the product in.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would recommend the regular tanning lotion or the flawless spray from Fake bake.</li>
      <li>However if you are not careful with PERFECT application --- it leaves you with dark tan streaks :\</li>
      <li>Very natural looking tan.</li>
      <li>Ive had this about a year and have tried so hard to love it  </li>
      <li>the look is natural and it lasts.</li>
      <li>I think fake bake is good product...</li>
      <li>has to be mixed with ANOTHER lotion for it to even look normal....</li>
      <li>I apply at night because it has kind of a weird smell to it.</li>
      <li>IT DRIES FAST as other reviewers state.  </li>
      <li>or it is a close tie, but the gel left two blotches, nothing major</li>
      <li>I like the dark color I got from it, but it washed off much faster than the tanning liquid.</li>
      <li>Product ok , I will use, little messy and does not stay too long, but ok.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
      <li>This product is very dark so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Since its tinted its easy to see where its applied.  </li>

<li> The gel dried wayyyyy to fast leaving blotched and unevenly tanned.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s kind of weird to put on because it is thick.</li>
<li> I usually use the fake bake 60 min spray and that is much better, in my opinion.</li>
<li> It was also not easy to apply evenly and was very messy &amp; dried so quick.</li>
<li> Not real excited about Fake Bake Xtreme.....if you are a light skintone person such as myself, it goes on very dark almost black</li>
<li> Def nicer than some other tanning products I&#x27;ve used</li>
<li> and you have to be very careful to blend well.</li>
<li> If you let it dry for a few minutes, it doesn&#x27;t get on clothes or bedding, either.  </li>
<li> because I felt it might really look fake tanned.  </li>
<li> Because it&#x27;s so dark</li>
<li> It does make you dark in color.</li>
<li> It IS dark however and does have a brown tone....not orange.  </li>
<li> gloves, because hands get too black.</li>
<li> I felt a little &amp;#</li>
<li> but not sure about the gel.  </li>
<li> considering the small tube, the price etc.</li>
<li> I personally am addicted to tanning beds but after using fake bake products I can finally give it up!</li>
<li> Goes on thick and splotchy.  </li>
<li> 34;fake tanned&amp;#34; tho which is never good</li>
<li> I usually like Fake Bake, but this one is yukky...</li>
<li> The gel is so dark that you can not use it with your hands, and therefore need gloves which make it impossible to rub in.</li>
<li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
<li> Ill stick with St. Tropez....</li>
<li> I started out with fake bake liquid tanner</li>
<li> Take it from me, stick with the spray oil from Fake Bake.</li>
<li> People are shocked when I say it&#x27;s fake from a bottle  ha</li>
<li> It streaks and looks dirty on my skin...</li>
<li> This stuff is horrible.</li>
<li> I tested it on my ankles and they turned a disgusting orange color that lasted 5 days before it went away.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> For me it does not work as well as the spray or lotion. I would definitely not recommend for beginners to self tanning as another reviewer stated you must work rather quickly to rub the product in.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is much more forgiving, I did apply the lotion on the left side of my body, the gel to the right. I am an experienced self tanner by the way, and the left side was flawless, think I maybe prefer the lotion to the spray? or it is a close tie, but the gel left two blotches, nothing major ,both colors turned out nicely.&lt;br /&gt;But considering the small tube, the price etc. I would recommend the regular tanning lotion or the flawless spray from Fake bake.</li>
    <li> I usually like Fake Bake, but this one is yukky...It streaks and looks dirty on my skin...Ill stick with St. Tropez....</li>
    <li> I have gotten so many compliments on my tan. People are shocked when I say it&#x27;s fake from a bottle  ha</li>
    <li> I like the dark color I got from it, but it washed off much faster than the tanning liquid. It was also not easy to apply evenly and was very messy &amp; dried so quick. If you really take time and are very careful you will get good results. But I highly recommend the liquid, much easier.</li>
    <li> I just put this stuff on. I look like I painted shoe polish all over myself. It is also very sticky. The gel is so dark that you can not use it with your hands, and therefore need gloves which make it impossible to rub in. I usually use the fake bake 60 min spray and that is much better, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over a week and it is even better than SUN brand. the look is natural and it lasts.</li>
    <li> Ive had this about a year and have tried so hard to love it  has to be mixed with ANOTHER lotion for it to even look normal.... Def nicer than some other tanning products I&#x27;ve used I just feel for that price you shouldn&#x27;t have to mix it with something</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible. I tested it on my ankles and they turned a disgusting orange color that lasted 5 days before it went away. I am glad that I did not just slap some of this gel on my face! That would of been a huge mistake. Plus shipping took forever..</li>
    <li> Product ok , I will use, little messy and does not stay too long, but ok.&lt;br /&gt;Use gloves, because hands get too black.</li>
    <li> Not real excited about Fake Bake Xtreme.....if you are a light skintone person such as myself, it goes on very dark almost black and you have to be very careful to blend well. *Would be great for a darker tone person; but I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> IT DRIES FAST as other reviewers state.  I also noticed that this rubs off easily so be prepared.  I think fake bake is good product...but not sure about the gel.  It IS dark however and does have a brown tone....not orange.  I felt a little &amp;#34;fake tanned&amp;#34; tho which is never good because I felt it might really look fake tanned.  just my opinion.</li>
    <li> Do your research! This is HIGHLY pigmented, fast drying gel. Using the gloves does not help out the situation either. The gel dried wayyyyy to fast leaving blotched and unevenly tanned. Take it from me, stick with the spray oil from Fake Bake. Usually I love their products but I really think they just missed the mark with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again, or recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I love this product.......would highly recommend this to anyone !!!  Wish it would come in bigger tubes, but for the same price !!!</li>
    <li> This is amazing!!! I personally am addicted to tanning beds but after using fake bake products I can finally give it up! I started out with fake bake liquid tanner and then I recently bought this product and the air self tanning spray tan. I&#x27;ve been using all three products and after one use I look like so much darker then I did before, like I&#x27;ve been tanning for two weeks, multiple shades darker!!!! At first I thought this was like a lotion but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s kind of weird to put on because it is thick. When you first put it on. You think oh god!!! Because it&#x27;s so dark but you can easily rub it in. By the time I am done applying to my whole body, the place I started with it is already darker!!! It doesn&#x27;t take much to apply to your whole body. I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND putting on lotion before this because it is much easier to rub in. I have gotten streaks before with this but as soon as I took a shower it came right off!!! So don&#x27;t worry if you have streaks! I apply at night because it has kind of a weird smell to it. Great product! And don&#x27;t give up if you see streaks! I about did but they came right off with some water, no scrubbing at all!</li>
    <li> Wear the gloves and rub in fast.  Make sure your skin is not overly dry as it will absorb to fast.  Very natural looking tan.</li>
    <li> I am done with the tanning beds and I wish I had known about this sooner!  I have been using it for a year now and I absolutely love it.  It looks funny when you put it on, but it does not streak and everyone compliments my tan!  I do it once a week and it keeps me looking tan.  Make sure to exfoliate and leave it on for the recommended time, you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, goes on we&#x27;ll and very pretty color. Make sure and use the gloves that are included in the box</li>
    <li> It leaves streaks. It does make you dark in color. However if you are not careful with PERFECT application --- it leaves you with dark tan streaks :\</li>
    <li> works well.....delivers nice, rich color.  Does not smell as strong as the original lotion formula. If you let it dry for a few minutes, it doesn&#x27;t get on clothes or bedding, either.  I will definitely buy this again.  TIP:  refrigerate to extend the shelf life.</li>
    <li> This product is very dark so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Since its tinted its easy to see where its applied.  Only used on my legs.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff!! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years and have been using tanning lotions for 15 years. This one definitely gives the most natural color and I love that it doesn&#x27;t give such a strong scent. I also love that when you put it on, it doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin for days and start to get blotchy. Very easy to apply and instant color. Definitely the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Goes on thick and splotchy.  Opt for the regular formula.</li>
