      <li>Product smells strong but lathers well.</li>
      <li>Average foaming cleanser at best.</li>
      <li>Nice crisp, clean smell.</li>
      <li>Overall, product is really nice, but I feel the smell sometimes is too strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay if you have normal hair, it is a bit smelly!&lt;br</li>

      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried using this as a shampoo, but as a bath gel, it works very well.</li>
      <li>Mild rosemary and mint scent and gentle cleansing for my very dry skin.  </li>

    <li> works well with hard well water. cleans my hair nicely, I haven&#x27;t used a conditioner and it has left my hair soft. I also like the fragrance, I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the fragrance, I thought the mint would over power the Rosemary but it doesn&#x27;t. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The smell of most shampoos puts me off. My delicate sniffer is offended not only by how they smell in the shower, but how they stick with you for hours. Enter C. Booth Rosemary and Mint. The odor is pleasant to begin with, and not too strong, or too long-lasting. You can take it as a compliment to the product that when I could no longer get the product locally, I searched the product out on the internet and go to the trouble of buying it online.</li>
    <li> Have ordered/used many bottles of this body wash...LOVE the smell, produces great lather and rinses nicely.  Good, good stuff!</li>
    <li> I had no idea this could be used as shampoo as well which is a plus!  I was looking for something super minty, and this is a bit more mild than I was expected, especially after reading the reviews.  However, it is still a great deal, uses natural ingredients and is minty.</li>
    <li> I wanted this because it is hard to find the shampoo or shower gel with rosemary. You get it all with this. Love it will order again.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance, and this scent is hard to find at my local pharmacy. Great for sensitive skin. No parabens are in this product.</li>
    <li> Refreshing.  Gives me a clean spa feeling, if you know what I mean.  I also like Breathe Easy, if Booth still makes it.</li>
    <li> In General! Oily hair doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> formula changed ?to me it has worse ingredient than parabens , they are methylchloroisothiazolinone  and  methylisothiazolinone...if you google them you will find out that they can be harmful to your health.  I wont buy this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you the most bang for your buck... wish it was thicker.</li>
    <li> good product, smells fresh</li>
