### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works excellently.</li>
      <li>Hope anyone who purchases this will be as happy as me!</li>
      <li>and I am very happy I bought this razor.</li>
      <li>this is the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
      <li>the best shave of my life with a DE razor.</li>
      <li>The Merkur 39C is the greatest razor I have ever experienced and gives the best shaving experience I have ever had.</li>
      <li>What a joy.  </li>
      <li>best a man can get also use a non steep angle for it much better that way</li>
      <li>The reason everyone has nice things to say about slant razors is because they work!</li>
      <li>Just a smooth, perfect shave.  </li>
      <li>Good weight, good grip, quality craftsmanship.</li>
      <li>so; not my best shave, but no cuts, just fun!</li>
      <li>The best razor for your shave is a slant, very mild shave when used with a light touch, bbs shaves every time.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing razor.  </li>
      <li>Excellent razor, not for those who need to shave fast.</li>
      <li>delivery was fast and efficient , and I am very happy with the product .&lt;br</li>
      <li>I suggest truly taking your time with this razor if your new to it, but this was an EXCELLENT investment</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this razor gives the best results of any DE razor I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>Having wet-shaved with the Merkur 39C in the morning (with a Derby blade), when I go to bed at night, 17 hours later, my face feels about like the best shave I could get with my Norelco electric.  </li>
      <li>Simply the best imho!!</li>
      <li>Most reviews state that it isn&#x27;t for</li>
      <li>I would liken it more to an all-terrain vehicle.</li>
      <li>what more could I say.</li>
      <li>IT LOVE IT</li>
      <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
      <li>The whiskers disappeared like magic.  </li>
      <li>top notch, first class, well chromed, good shave.</li>
      <li>However, It gives good tactile feedback and will quickly tell you if you aren&#x27;t making smooth</li>
      <li>I only had Feather blades, so I knew going in to this that I was going to have a true scythe to deal with, and it was marvelous!</li>
      <li>One review I remember reading somewhere compared using the Merkur 39C to driving a wonderfully handling car with a well engineered suspension and manual transmission in contrast to other safety razors the person had used which were like automatic transmission clunkers.</li>
      <li>Follow the basic guidelines of DE shaving and you&#x27;ll be more than happy with the result.</li>
      <li>I slipped a Merkur blade in this finely crafted razor, lathered up and went to work.  </li>
      <li>Just a light pressure on the handle and let the razor do all the work.  </li>
      <li>The shaves are close and the razor is comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>The first shave I had with this razor was very smooth.  </li>
      <li>but my experience with it leaves me strongly suspecting that this excellent razor would be &#x27;hard to beat&#x27; at any price].</li>
      <li>Even with the first shave, the result is positively stunning.</li>
      <li>True with any razor, but find this will unintentionally level off high spots like a cheese grater if not using good technique or applying too much pressure.  </li>
      <li>(I have perhaps taken the image farther than he had due to my great enthusiasm for this razor).</li>
      <li>It is super close on head shaving.</li>
      <li>This razor is definitely worthy of all the 5 star reviews.</li>
      <li>This razor comes highly recommended by many.  </li>
      <li>went and every one afterwards - even, to my surprise, where I had lumps from reactions to deer fly and mosquito bites from working outside when my hands were occupied] and the rewards, at least for me with my skin and beard and hair type, have been great.</li>
      <li>I just got my Merkur in today and tried it out, this was the by far the best and closest shave of my life,  I am fairly new to the DE shaving, but I will never go back after today</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a great second razor in your rotation, making sure you use it at least once or week or more.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t make an &amp;#34;HD&amp;#34; version of the 39C that&#x27;s distinct from a non-HD version.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and I should have known better, but I was very keen to try this beast out!</li>
      <li>I have had some cuts while getting used to it, but once I got the proper use down, it is wonderful.</li>
      <li>This was my first slant razor and it is a closer shave.</li>
      <li>weight and long handle allow a comfortable secure grip while one just steers.  </li>
      <li>This razor is definitely at the top of my collection now.  </li>
      <li>Not a razor for a first time user.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with a DE razor for about a year now but only with the very mild Edwin Jagger de89.</li>
      <li>I was a bit too timid to really get close around the nose and mouth</li>
      <li>, the Merkur 39c gives a very close cut.</li>
      <li>So close, I am kissably smooth 36-hours later.</li>
      <li>First time out I got a little comfortable too quick and paid the price for it.</li>
      <li>I was intimidated at first because of other reviews but as long as you respect it and take your time, it will deliver a superior shave.</li>
      <li>I did the whole routine with hot towel and Proraso red (love the smell) and was definitely NOT in a hurry.</li>
      <li>I am much too new to wet shaving to have tried this safely, but I really took time and care.</li>
      <li>[I was surprised how smoothly the second shave with it</li>
      <li>But, you can shave with it on Sunday night, and then use a high end electric for days to save time.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this to people who desire a close  shave .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I was a little worried at first about the aggressiveness of it, but for me the shave was surprisingly smooth and irritation-free.</li>
      <li>Even in the middle of the day my face feels almost as smooth as if I&#x27;ve just finished shaving it with the un-slanted double edge razor</li>
      <li>The key is to be careful and not in a hurry around more problematic spots like Adam&#x27;s apple, moles, etc.  </li>
      <li>This was my first DE shaving experience and there is no going back.</li>
      <li>Good heavy duty razor, takes a little practice if you&#x27;re not used to old school, but more forgiving than other double edges I&#x27;ve had.</li>
      <li>(Think of the guillotine&#x27;s slicing action compared to the butcher knife is how it works.)</li>
      <li>Everyone has different skin and whiskers, but I&#x27;m really sold on the benefits of using a slant razor.</li>
      <li>But in the last month after several decades of using other razors I have found again this wonderful sense of control, thanks to the 39C but with a safety razor so there is not the same risk if one slips into using it less carefully or some outside factor disturbs one&#x27;s shaving.     </li>
      <li>Used this razor for the first time last night after coming back from a &amp;#34;non-shaving&amp;#34; vacation of four days.  </li>
      <li>nothing else seemed to offer; however,after two times when I was in a hurry and a bit distracted (and paid for it getting a lesson in why safety razors had been a great invention) I reluctantly gave up this control in the interest of avoiding another unpleasant lesson in the penalties of not being quite careful enough for straight razors.</li>
      <li>I appreciated the recommendation to try a blade that was not as sharp as the Feather.</li>

<li> long, including the head, and weighs 111.8 g (3.944 oz.).  </li>
<li> It does not take long</li>
<li> You shave the same way, with the same strokes, but instead of sliding over the hair and cutting it, the slant razor slices down and across hair diagonally, making for a more efficient, assertive shave.</li>
<li> I decided to go back to the DE due to the expense of cartridges and to reduce the amount of plastic I use.   </li>
<li> A few decades ago,I found that even an inexpensive second hand straight razor allowed a precision of cutting right up to the edge of a beard or moustache</li>
<li> I will not be spending any money on razors or blades for a very long time now.  </li>
<li> I think if one uses it properly, the 39C actually irritates the skin less and is less likely to cut.    </li>
<li> One can get cut, but the cut is limited by the safety razor design.</li>
<li> Letting the razor do the work - it effortlessly mows down one or several days of beard growth with fewer passes or touch up.</li>
<li> I learned how to shave with a DE and used them for years, finally switching to cartridges during a military deployment - cartridges take up less space and are easier to shave with if you don&#x27;t have a mirror.</li>
<li> If you are a person with some rudimentary wet shaving experience, do not be deterred from trying this</li>
<li> The result is that I feel that the 39C makes other safety razors or (especially) the plastic-steel multiple edge devices seem clunky and clumsy and</li>
<li> aggressive at all, you just have to be careful just like with other razors</li>
<li> It is like any other tool, if you use care you won&#x27;t knick yourself.</li>
<li> [I should add that, of course, I have not used every other razor on the market now</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t understand all the fear and warnings from the other reviews.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Assuming proper face prep and a slick lather</li>
<li> I will go back to my un-slanted razor for now, but when I rev up my technique in a few months I&#x27;ll be eager for round 2.</li>
<li> So if you see a higher price for a 39C that the dealer has given an &amp;#34;HD&amp;#34; designation than you see for a 39C without the &amp;#34;HD&amp;#34; designation, go for the less expensive of the two.</li>
<li> It may be that the risk of cutting if used inattentively is greater with this razor than with some other safety razors or other type razors being sold now,but on the other hand perhaps because of the greater amount of exposed blade and perhaps also its slant cutting design, one can vary how the cutting is done by changing angle.  </li>
<li> For this shaver it means less</li>
<li> I used previously - a Perfecto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is an amazing razor.  Having wet-shaved with the Merkur 39C in the morning (with a Derby blade), when I go to bed at night, 17 hours later, my face feels about like the best shave I could get with my Norelco electric.  Even in the middle of the day my face feels almost as smooth as if I&#x27;ve just finished shaving it with the un-slanted double edge razor I used previously - a Perfecto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, but don&#x27;t be fooled when checking prices - there&#x27;s only one model of Merkur 39C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur doesn&#x27;t make an &amp;#34;HD&amp;#34; version of the 39C that&#x27;s distinct from a non-HD version.  So if you see a higher price for a 39C that the dealer has given an &amp;#34;HD&amp;#34; designation than you see for a 39C without the &amp;#34;HD&amp;#34; designation, go for the less expensive of the two. You&#x27;ll get the same razor, either way, as long as it&#x27;s a 39C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 39C is described by Merkur as long-handled, slant, and chrome-plated.  And the handle has that barber pole look. The Merkur number model for this long-handled, slant design, chrome-plated razor with the barber pole look is &amp;#34;90 39 001&amp;#34;.  Its UPC code is 4045284012475.  Both numbers should appear on the bar code label affixed to the factory packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 39C measures 100.7 mm (4.0 in.) long, including the head, and weighs 111.8 g (3.944 oz.).  All Merkur 39C have these measurements.</li>
    <li> So aggressive, I had to learn how to shave all over again. So close, I am kissably smooth 36-hours later.</li>
    <li> There is an intimidation factor with this razor. Called &amp;#34;sledgehammer&amp;#34;, its described as aggressive and heavy. If you are a person with some rudimentary wet shaving experience, do not be deterred from trying this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight and long handle allow a comfortable secure grip while one just steers.  Letting the razor do the work - it effortlessly mows down one or several days of beard growth with fewer passes or touch up. For this shaver it means less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming proper face prep and a slick lather, the Merkur 39c gives a very close cut. The key is to be careful and not in a hurry around more problematic spots like Adam&#x27;s apple, moles, etc.  True with any razor, but find this will unintentionally level off high spots like a cheese grater if not using good technique or applying too much pressure.  However, It gives good tactile feedback and will quickly tell you if you aren&#x27;t making smooth passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this razor gives the best results of any DE razor I&#x27;ve used so far. Everyone has different skin and whiskers, but I&#x27;m really sold on the benefits of using a slant razor.</li>
    <li> The Merkur 39C is the greatest razor I have ever experienced and gives the best shaving experience I have ever had. A few decades ago,I found that even an inexpensive second hand straight razor allowed a precision of cutting right up to the edge of a beard or moustache nothing else seemed to offer; however,after two times when I was in a hurry and a bit distracted (and paid for it getting a lesson in why safety razors had been a great invention) I reluctantly gave up this control in the interest of avoiding another unpleasant lesson in the penalties of not being quite careful enough for straight razors. But in the last month after several decades of using other razors I have found again this wonderful sense of control, thanks to the 39C but with a safety razor so there is not the same risk if one slips into using it less carefully or some outside factor disturbs one&#x27;s shaving.     One can get cut, but the cut is limited by the safety razor design. It may be that the risk of cutting if used inattentively is greater with this razor than with some other safety razors or other type razors being sold now,but on the other hand perhaps because of the greater amount of exposed blade and perhaps also its slant cutting design, one can vary how the cutting is done by changing angle.

One review I remember reading somewhere compared using the Merkur 39C to driving a wonderfully handling car with a well engineered suspension and manual transmission in contrast to other safety razors the person had used which were like automatic transmission clunkers. (I have perhaps taken the image farther than he had due to my great enthusiasm for this razor). It does not take long I feel to learn to use this razor well...[I was surprised how smoothly the second shave with it went and every one afterwards - even, to my surprise, where I had lumps from reactions to deer fly and mosquito bites from working outside when my hands were occupied] and the rewards, at least for me with my skin and beard and hair type, have been great. [I should add that, of course, I have not used every other razor on the market now but my experience with it leaves me strongly suspecting that this excellent razor would be &#x27;hard to beat&#x27; at any price].</li>
    <li> Good heavy duty razor, takes a little practice if you&#x27;re not used to old school, but more forgiving than other double edges I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> top notch, first class, well chromed, good shave. what more could I say.</li>
    <li> I learned how to shave with a DE and used them for years, finally switching to cartridges during a military deployment - cartridges take up less space and are easier to shave with if you don&#x27;t have a mirror. I decided to go back to the DE due to the expense of cartridges and to reduce the amount of plastic I use.   After reading reviews on several razors I choose the 39C since it is supposed to give a closer shave. Most reviews state that it isn&#x27;t for \\&quot;Newbies\\&quot;. BS! It is like any other tool, if you use care you won&#x27;t knick yourself. The shaves are close and the razor is comfortable to use. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was my first DE shaving experience and there is no going back. I was intimidated at first because of other reviews but as long as you respect it and take your time, it will deliver a superior shave.</li>
    <li> The reason everyone has nice things to say about slant razors is because they work! (Think of the guillotine&#x27;s slicing action compared to the butcher knife is how it works.) Merkur nicknamed this 39c \\&quot;Sledgehammer\\&quot; because of its 4.25-oz. weight. And while it&#x27;s not my everyday razor, it&#x27;s the razor that gives me the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever received from any razor. You shave the same way, with the same strokes, but instead of sliding over the hair and cutting it, the slant razor slices down and across hair diagonally, making for a more efficient, assertive shave. Even with the first shave, the result is positively stunning. I think it&#x27;s a great second razor in your rotation, making sure you use it at least once or week or more. In the end, to know what I&#x27;m talking about, you just have to buy one and use it. Trust me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Don&#x27;t wait five or ten years and then try it, make this your next razor purchase.</li>
    <li> My third Merkur razor! Simply the best imho!!</li>
    <li> I bought a Parker before the Slant &amp; this shaves twice as close. Good weight, good grip, quality craftsmanship. Been using it for two years. It has paid for itself in blades I would have bought. I bought a hundred pack of blades &amp; still have fifty left. I shave my face daily &amp; my head twice a week. It is super close on head shaving. I started by using a dull blade after shaving my face for three days until I got it down packed, it would cut the skin off a scar I had if I got heavy handed</li>
    <li> Another review compares this razor to driving a stick-shift sports car. I would liken it more to an all-terrain vehicle. I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and I should have known better, but I was very keen to try this beast out! I did the whole routine with hot towel and Proraso red (love the smell) and was definitely NOT in a hurry. I could feel every move of the blade on my face. I only had Feather blades, so I knew going in to this that I was going to have a true scythe to deal with, and it was marvelous! I am much too new to wet shaving to have tried this safely, but I really took time and care. I was a bit too timid to really get close around the nose and mouth so; not my best shave, but no cuts, just fun! I will go back to my un-slanted razor for now, but when I rev up my technique in a few months I&#x27;ll be eager for round 2.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor, not for those who need to shave fast. If you don&#x27;t respect it, it will reach out and bite you. Used in conjunction with feather blades one of the closest shaves you can get.</li>
    <li> Very solid razor.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try a slant razor...this is the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
    <li> best a man can get also use a non steep angle for it much better that way</li>
    <li> what a razor!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;you will get the closest shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;not aggressive at all, you just have to be careful just like with other razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT LOVE IT ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT</li>
    <li> The best razor for your shave is a slant, very mild shave when used with a light touch, bbs shaves every time.</li>
    <li> Works excellently. I have had some cuts while getting used to it, but once I got the proper use down, it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This razor comes highly recommended by many.  Called the \\&quot;sledgehammer\\&quot; it is a heavy weight razor.  You are paying for a quality razor that does the job.  The edge of the razor is held at an angle so that a single pass across the face actually \\&quot;saws\\&quot; the hairs.  The first shave I had with this razor was very smooth.  Will take me some time to master shaving with this very traditional razor.</li>
    <li> The closest shave imaginable with a Feather Blade. Not a razor for a first time user. The slant is not a forgiving edge. But, you can shave with it on Sunday night, and then use a high end electric for days to save time. Worth the money. Put on your big boy pants and get it.</li>
    <li> This was my first slant razor and it is a closer shave. I appreciated the recommendation to try a blade that was not as sharp as the Feather. First time out I got a little comfortable too quick and paid the price for it. Now, use it for that extra close cut. I have been using Personna Blades to get used to the feel of the shave. Looking to move to my Astras that are my usually go to.</li>
    <li> Used this razor for the first time last night after coming back from a &amp;#34;non-shaving&amp;#34; vacation of four days.  I slipped a Merkur blade in this finely crafted razor, lathered up and went to work.  What a joy.  This thing glided like silk over my face.  The whiskers disappeared like magic.  Just a light pressure on the handle and let the razor do all the work.  I could feel the subtle vibration as the blade sliced through the stubble field of whiskers, like a hot knife through butter.  Not a nick, cut, or drop of blood.  Just a smooth, perfect shave.  This razor is definitely at the top of my collection now.  Would buy again and recommend to anyone.  I don&#x27;t understand all the fear and warnings from the other reviews.  This razor is a pussy cat.</li>
    <li> I received the product a few days ago and just started using it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was fast and efficient , and I am very happy with the product .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to people who desire a close  shave .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> I just got my Merkur in today and tried it out, this was the by far the best and closest shave of my life,  I am fairly new to the DE shaving, but I will never go back after today, i read and watched a lot of videos on you tube saying this is an aggressive razor, and yes it is, I got a few little nicks, but am not the slightest bit worried about that the benefits outweigh the &amp;#34;nicks&amp;#34; plus I ordered an alum block as well to help with cuts.  I suggest truly taking your time with this razor if your new to it, but this was an EXCELLENT investment and I am very happy I bought this razor. 5 stars. would give it 6 if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone, just LEARN the tool like I plan on doing. I will not be spending any money on razors or blades for a very long time now.  Hope anyone who purchases this will be as happy as me!</li>
    <li> This razor is definitely worthy of all the 5 star reviews. I was a little worried at first about the aggressiveness of it, but for me the shave was surprisingly smooth and irritation-free. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a DE razor for about a year now but only with the very mild Edwin Jagger de89. So the day my 39c came I decided to give it a go. I followed the same preshave routine as I always do. The result........ the best shave of my life with a DE razor. Three passes with no cuts and I&#x27;m left with the BBS shave that I&#x27;ve been waiting for. Don&#x27;t let the aggressiveness of this razor scare you. Follow the basic guidelines of DE shaving and you&#x27;ll be more than happy with the result.</li>
