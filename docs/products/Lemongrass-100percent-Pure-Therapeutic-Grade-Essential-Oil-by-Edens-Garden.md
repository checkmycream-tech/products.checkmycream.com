<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great  product! I love it</li>
    <li> A bit strong Kind of smells like Pledge furniture polish.</li>
    <li> Lemongrass 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil- 10 ml I mix in a tiny spray bottle from the dollar store with vinegar, or other and it rids bugs on you or near you.  Love it</li>
    <li> I mix a few drops with my shampoo and helps control the oil longer and adds volume I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I really love essential oils. I have blended several carrier oils lemongrass and rosemary. It is very pleasing smell and relaxed my muscles after a vigorous exercise.</li>
    <li> Fabulous Essential Oul without a HUGE price tag! This oil is awesome and it&#x27;s so inexpensive! I will never buy an oils and pay an obnoxious price tag EVER again :) SO happy!!</li>
    <li> I am always using lemongrass in my diffuser. Love the aroma and the &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Used to make foaming body scrub.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with outcome.  I love natural fresh scents and I will be buying more of this.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. A lil bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Perfect timing! Quick delivery! AND the product was just as it says. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend to anyone who make their own burner scents! Love the Light Lemony smell!</li>
    <li> Extremely low quality. Buyer Beware! Do not believe the good reviews, they are just fake reviews left by Edens Garden employees.</li>
    <li> Its ok but not 100%....</li>
    <li> This is a unique scent. Very grandma/homely.</li>
    <li> Have this scent from another company and Eden&#x27;s Garden version smells so much better! Would recommend highly.  All their oils are great.  Don&#x27;t let the price fool you! Ordered several times.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product under the intentions of using it to keep bugs away from my house.  I mix a certain amount of this oil with water, and add it to a spray bottle.  This stuff repels bugs, including ants, spiders, etc.  Great for anywhere bugs are, and the best part is, IT SMELLS AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Love this scent, I use it in my facial wash and I can definitely notice my skin clearing up.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents by far! Love all products!</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> Really like the way Lemongrass smells, was very happy with this essential oil. It has a very nice light citrus smell &amp; blends well with other oils. Love Eden&#x27;s Garden</li>
    <li> Love this oil. It is a perfect pure extract aroma oil. I am using it for bath, diffuser, and massage. Such a great quality. Would like purchase other oils too. :)</li>
    <li> Fresh smell and works well in tea light heaters.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells like lemongrass (go figure). My wife uses this with the organic seaweed powder from Azara. Work like a champ to give a fragrant aroma during the facial.</li>
    <li> Lemongrass reminds me of the steam room at a spa I recently visited!  It&#x27;s so relaxing and soothing.  According to a book I&#x27;m reading Lemongrass is a purifier, uplifter, good for oily skin and indigstion.</li>
    <li> I have a highly strong smell I didn&#x27;t really like it not my kind of smell,</li>
    <li> Love the clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You feel energized once you put it on.</li>
    <li> Good quality oil. I use it to get a good smell in my house - Just a few drops and the house smells good.</li>
    <li> This Lemon Grass smells so fresh.  I plan to use it along with Citronella and Tea Tree Essential Oils and a carrier base like Grapeseed Oil or Sweet Almond Oil to make a oil for a friends finger nail fungus, Yuck.  He has tried everything medical now it is time to go the natural way.  I think I will also use this in a sugar scrub as well.  Lovely smell.</li>
    <li> Great price for a super great product</li>
    <li> Use in my wash and makes my was smell divine.</li>
    <li> Perfect.. I&#x27;m using this as a swarm attractant for honey bees..</li>
    <li> Really like this oil seems to work well mixed with others to keep the bugs off.</li>
    <li> i bought this to repel bugs in the summer time.  I have not had the chance to use it that way (its winter now) BUT the smell is amazing! Even if it does not work as a bug repellant im still very happy because it smells wonderful!  It’s very calming to me.  I can just it in my diffuser if it doesn&#x27;t work out.  I buy lots of my oils from this company.  They are always fast and great products</li>
    <li> It came with a book explaining the health benefits for many essences and oils. This one is a natural alternative to pesticides indoors.</li>
    <li> I am just learning the uses for essential oils and ordered this for a specific problem.  Anyone planning to use this should be aware that it stains the skin much like a self tanner so apply with a Qtip only to the desired area.</li>
    <li> Fresh intense smell a few drops 3-4 in water is all I need to make house smell fresh and keep flies and Mosquitos away.</li>
    <li> smells great and can keep mosquitos away</li>
    <li> Smells SO good and shipped really fast.</li>
    <li> Great product. It was perfect for spring honey bee swarm capturing.</li>
    <li> Great value, and product.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite essential oil scents,...I really love the citrus scents. Lemongrass, lemon, lime, sweet orange, grapefruit,...the citrus scents are uplifting and help enhance your moods. This lemongrass essential oil has a slight earthy undertone while it still carries the fresh lemon scent too. It smells great added into a diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemongrass also has antiseptic, and astringent properties which when added to facial toners will help fight oily skin and acne. You can also add it to a small spray bottle of water and use around the house to help keep away bugs and make your house smell great at the same time!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I live in the Virgin Islands and the tea is a morning drink for us. I love the strong, true scent of the lemon grass. I put it in my skin and hair oils, my wax burner, my laundry, I put it on a cotton ball and place it in my trash bin and in the a/c vent in my car. Excellent price. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived quickly. I use quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a ton of essential oils lately, and this one is by far the most pungent and lovely.  It smells just like the lemongrass I cook with, and it is strong.</li>
    <li> First purchase from Edens Garden. I love the smell, came fast and packaged well. Excited to try more from them!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be exactly like Do Terra but no it&#x27;s not</li>
    <li> I have ordered from Eden&#x27;s Garden three times, and all three times they have messed up my order. The oils are good, maybe not quite as good as the really high cost stuff, but good enough for the price. Unfortunately whomever fulfills the orders does an absolutely terrible job... each time we&#x27;ve ordered quite a few, and every time we&#x27;ve received the wrong ones. The first two times they ended up shipping us the ones that we were missing. Well, the last time I ordered, I filed the same missing product report, and nothing ever received. Even if a replacement was received the last time around, it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to fulfill an order properly, the first time around. It really bothers me when a customer is treated this way. Word of warning to those looking to purchase from this seller!</li>
    <li> great service, will order again</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Very strong beautiful scent.  A must have for many uses.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got the package. I mixed this essential oil to my Shea butter (used olive oil as carrier oil), and finally made a wonderful face moisturizer, body cream and deodorant. Great product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am a fragrance oil junkie - yes I&#x27;ve admit it. I find burning oils in my soapstone oil/wax diffuser from Pier1 very relaxing. This oil is somewhat more on the medicinal smelling side - in a similar tone to spearmint, eucalyptus, etc oils. This is a good brand of oil. I only use it for burning in my diffuser. I like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am still using this stuff. I works well. It places a very strong scent in the entire room. you don&#x27;t have to worry about it not grabbing someone&#x27;s sense of smell at first entrance. It works great.</li>
    <li> Finally received the right oil (Lemongrass). Love the scent &amp; excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> I use essential oils in my Shea body butter concoctions. The lemongrass is good alone or blended with other fragrances. I&#x27;m please with the product and will buy more.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, It smells great. It should be bigger in size. I love the enclose book. It educate you on all other oils and its function. i will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Love this oil!  One of my favorites.  Have bought numerous oils from this seller and have been pleased with all of them.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite essential oils to use for cleaning purposes, in soap and candles. This has a strong scent which I love. These oils are not cut. Definitely worth the price. Price is reasonable. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good and nice smell...is nice to put and I loved  in the future I will order more ....  I was very happy</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this essential oil. So soothing when I added it to my Seaweed mixture. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is great for fragrances, cleaning, cleansing and just overall pouring a few drops in your bath.  I love this and will order a few more bottles...</li>
    <li> Very strong smell! GREAT PRODUCT at great price. One drop is all you need! Great value for the price. I&#x27;d recommend it anyone.</li>
    <li> This smells SO GOOD! I put a couple of drops my candle warmer in some water and it makes the whole house smell awesome!</li>
    <li> I really love the lemon grass, it has a nice calming smell. My son loves it, he likes for me to put it on for him before he goes to bed.</li>
    <li> I bought a collection of oils from this vendor because they had the most ones I wanted and were reasonably priced.  I didn&#x27;t want to deal with a bunch of different shipping charges and sellers.  I was not disappointed.  The price was right, delivery was fast and the oil seemed perfect.  A lot of the oils on the market were diluted but this said pure and seems so.  Lemongrass is one of my favorite oils for aromatherapy and cleansing.</li>
    <li> Make my own flea spray.</li>
    <li> Been using thia for more than a week now! It actually keeps bugs away!</li>
    <li> Fresh smell in the diffuser.  So far I have enjoyed the Edens Garden oils.</li>
    <li> Very strong. Good quality. Smell gorgeous mixed with lavender</li>
    <li> Received rancid/defective essential oil  - protective seal was broken on the lid  - seller would not replace it; expects me to pay return shipping charges and amazon.com sided with seller!  Beware Buyers!!</li>
    <li> Work great for my allergies</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is lasting, It last from morning to night . I really light it</li>
    <li> Lemongrass is one of my favorite essential oils. It has several uses and has a great aroma. Works wonders as a bug deterrent.</li>
    <li> I love these essential oils. They are a high quality oil and I will only purchase them from Eden&#x27;s Garden. I am newbie when it comes to using these oils but I did purchase a few from other companies and the quality was so horrible that they could not even be used. Purchase all of your essential oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden and you will not be disappointed. Thank you Eden&#x27;s Garden for your high quality products.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with Edens Garden. Not only is the Lemongrass Essential Oil divine, it came with a beautiful booklet that&#x27;s so loaded with information about their other essential oils and uses for them. It also came with a little pamphlet that&#x27;s chock-full of information. I am so impressed. What great customer service. The product itself is very high quality. A little goes a long way. I use it for aromatherapy and to freshen the scent of a seaweed scrub I use. I love it. And I will definitely buy from Edens Garden again. That little booklet is so beautiful and informative, it has inspired me to look into aromatherapy and buy more product.</li>
    <li> do not post my last name</li>
    <li> Perfect well packaged I like all of the scents I have purchased priced right I would recommend this seller and product and I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> used as bee attractant. good stuff</li>
    <li> This oil is really great.  I use it to mix cleaning solutions.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Mixed with Epsom salt in your bath water for a refreshing feeling.</li>
    <li> A required oil for the healing homemade balm I am making. Smells great. Works great! I actually put this on my dog after washing her and she smells fantastic. A wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> LOVE this scent.  A little goes a long way.  Made the entire house smell great.  Used in my bathwater, soothing.</li>
    <li> Lemon grass smells so good. Its refreshing and gives a &#x27;clean&#x27; smell. I use it when I mop around the house just fill a bucket with warm water, vinegar, some soap, and a few drops of lemon grass oil. This will leave you with that &#x27;pinesol&#x27; clean smell without all the harmful chemicals and much cheaper :)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the scents I purchased. I also purchased the organic lavender. It has a nice lavender scent instead of the woodsy ones I seem to find in stores. I also wanted to change items in my order and they did it with no extra charge. The company contacted me immediately and were happy to help with my request. I will absolutely order from here again. The quality is wonderful and items came faster than expected. Love!!!</li>
    <li> It does what it does as its name suggests.  Nice way to brighten a room, furniture, laundry, closed spaces.  I&#x27;ve mixed with other fragrances to  accent other essential oil blends.  Be careful as lemongrass does a good job keeping its punch; and it can overtake other aromas easily, similar to the power of lavender or peppermint or eucalyptus.  Good buy.  Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I have the lemon and the lemongrass Essential Oil and i like them both the only thing i notice is the Lemongrass has a stronger scent i dont need as much of this on the plug in ball just a few drops and the House smells so nice,</li>
    <li> Great for humans and puppy</li>
    <li> this is my favorite scent out of all of them I is awesome she also included a cool book about oils she will be my go to person for oils now thanks</li>
    <li> Good buy for the quality..hopefully the Bees will come.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s definitely a chemical and unnatural smell behind these. At first, a lemongrass scent. Great. Then after, a man-made, headache-inducing chemical smell. Similar to an aftertaste. Let&#x27;s call it an aftersmell. Next time I&#x27;ll spend a bit more to get a more pure, higher quality essential oil.</li>

    <li> Great product!  So much more inexpensive than buying in Organic Stores.  Wonderfully powerful Lemongrass. IVe used it topically, in sea salt scrub, and also in candles.  Very worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Smells awful, but is helping with a few other oils in a blend for my husbands joint pain</li>
    <li> I have bought essential oils from this company before and really liked their scents. I make guest soaps and this scent really is lovely. I also use a few drops in hot water to release the smell for aromatherapy use. It is awesome!</li>
    <li> Yep its lemongrass oil Allright</li>
    <li> I actually used this oil for a homemade deodorant that I made. It smelled really good and it&#x27;s perfect for fragrance.</li>
    <li> Always useful fro my crafting adventures!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it for various purposes.</li>
    <li> I love it, I use it to clean our bathroom. Add a few drops to white vinegar and the perfect blend to freshen up.</li>
    <li> Quick purchase.  Shipped and rec&#x27;d in 2 days.  Great item for the price.</li>
    <li> just what i wanted thankyou</li>
    <li> Mine was leaking when I received this pkg. I like directions and uses to accompany my health products, this pkgdidnthave that</li>
    <li> It smells heavenly, I add it to my seaweed mixture.</li>
    <li> Love this oil!!! The smell is amazing!  Will be purchasing again really soon</li>
    <li> I purchased this originally as an ingredient in my concoction for combating my mosquito and biting fly problem. YES! In combination with the other essential oils I purchased, the medium, and a simple diffuser, my patio is mosquito and biting fly free and I am back to being able to use it. This product arrived quickly and smelled really good. It is strong, and I blended it with the other essential oils and my medium and placed it in a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have psoriatic arthritis and there is little that actually helps except opiate medications. I was looking online for essential oils to blend for my mosquito problem and decided that I should give this a try for my joints. Back to google! I found a number of useful &amp;#34;hints&amp;#34; and some not so useful, like &amp;#34;buy my product,&amp;#34; not useful. Once I had a good-sized list of a few oils to blend together, back to amazon for the purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later, I was desperate for pain relief, and I grabbed the diffuser. I poured some directly onto my knees and legs and rubbed. I went to bed. When I woke up in the morning, for the first time in 4 months I woke up without any pain at all in my legs and hips. No meds!</li>
    <li> Recieved bottle 1/4 empty due to cap not properly placed. I ordered eucalyptus as well and that one was full. Other than that I love the product!</li>
    <li> not a regularly used oil, but need on hand for special uses. good quality.</li>
    <li> Good quality oil.  Bottle was larger than I find in health stores, which is a nice surprise and a better buy.&lt;br /&gt;I use 10 drops in a 1/2 gal of vinegar as a fabric softener in the washer.</li>
    <li> Love it and can&#x27;t wait to buy more essential oils! Shopping online was fast and easy and the product shipped within 2 days!</li>
    <li> I ordered Lemongrass 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil and when it arrive it was only Lemon Oil. I could not return it as I had opened the bottle. Very disappointed with product.</li>
    <li> Great scent. You don&#x27;t need much. I use with a mix of carrier oils and other essential oil to combat oily skin and acne.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my homemade bleach and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Love edens garden essential oils</li>
    <li> Nice scent for cleaning.  I put this oil in my vinegar/water mixture and use a spary bottle.  Dropper leaks a bit though.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Edens Garden essential oils, but this one is a bit too strong for my taste.  I mostly use the oils in a diffuser and though I find the scent itself fresh and pleasant, the diffused oil is actually so strong that it irritates my eyes and skin. I have stopped using it in favor of lemon, orange and bergamot oil from the same company.  I do find this oil useful in the bathroom and kitchen for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I am in love with Eden&#x27;s Garden oils.  They have such a large selection at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love how this smells.  I&#x27;ve been using this on my wool dryer balls in the clothes dryer.  It leaves a light scent on our clothing without being overpowering.  A few drops on each dryer ball usually last 4-6 loads as well.</li>
    <li> Liked this in my homemade insect spray.</li>
    <li> I used a couple of the recipes for making a couple of house cleaners with this essential oils.  Makes my house smell clean.  I am still experimenting but would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great product and good company</li>
    <li> Eden&#x27;s Garden never fails to deliver a great product at an even better price!</li>
    <li> It smells nice and I have used it a couple times. Nice packaging, well protected. So far so good. I got five different oils. They are all good.</li>
    <li> Love the clean, fresh fragrance. Its an oil that last all day. This is a real essential oil not a cheap knock off. This company even includes paper work on how to essential oils in many ways. Shipped super fast.</li>
    <li> Using this for my own anti-bacterial spray like found in Bath &amp; Body Works.  1 part water and 1 part vinegar and just add a drop or however many to your liking.</li>
    <li> arrived wonderfully, bubble wrapped, love the scent. Lemon dropish.</li>
    <li> Great product and great company!</li>
    <li> I love this scent. All their essential oils are very high quality, and have pleasant aromas for homeamse soaps.</li>
    <li> Not very high quality oils. Not much aroma and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Great for my diffuser. Love the quality!</li>
    <li> It has a nice, clean and earthy smell to it.  I like this product and its a great scent for just about any season.</li>
    <li> I love this on a cotton ball in the room I am working in and should a nice soothing fragrance! The orange oil too is great for that.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I use this product in my office. We own a travel agency and the lemongrass oil sets an \\&quot;island spa\\&quot; aroma. Very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Use it in the candle warmers</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> Put this in your CD player in the car and start the day off right!</li>
    <li> I use this every morning and it clears my head and is better than drinking a cup of coffee. It gives me the energy I need to start my day.</li>
    <li> Gift, friend was very happy and I will order more!</li>
    <li> this product was not what i thought it would be. I was thinking of this hand lotion that I had before with lemongrass in it, but this didn&#x27;t smell like the lotion. But it was still a nice smell.  It got here fast.</li>
    <li> Great to use in handmade soaps.</li>
    <li> The scent is ok, but it is very over powering. I am not sure I will buy it again or if I need to try using it another way.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Lemongrass. It has so many uses, can be added to a carrier oil for massages, can be used to rid your pet of fleas, infection, fever, digestion issues.  Lemongrass oil can also help relax and tone your muscles, as well as relieve muscle pain, rheumatism, period cramps, stomachache, toothache, migraines, and headaches. The seller packaged this so it wasn&#x27;t able to be broken, I received it in a timely manner and will not be without it.</li>
    <li> Very strong scent. I&#x27;m using it on my spider veins. The verdict is still out.</li>
    <li> The fragrance smells delightful.  You can put it on some cotton balls for a good smell throughout the house.</li>
    <li> I tried lemongrass with the seaweed. What a mess it was and didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent experience.  Originally purchased to be mixed with Sea Weed for a cellulite wrap....Sea Weed wrap was a very messy experience; and not repeated!  However the Lemongrass scent was wonderful.  I put a few drops in the bath each night. &amp; would recommend this to anyone who is seeking a relaxing soak in the tub.</li>
    <li> I bought multiple scents from this company and I am very satisfied with them all. This scent is not my FAVORITE scent, but that is just my preference. It mixes well with soaps and lotions which is all that matters to me. I will definately continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> Great product and very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I received my order on time it smelled amazing I liked the way it was packaged &amp; I also got a brochure &amp; different ways to use it.  I will be ordering this again &amp; I will also be ordering other oils from the same company, thank you</li>
    <li> This has a very strong, pleasant, fresh, lemony smell. It works well for aromatherapy. Have to see how it works with homemade hair products.</li>
    <li> love the lemongrass smells sweet its perfect as antiseptic bug bites. yayaya or just aroma therapy.  trying to make mu own theives old wish me luck thwnk u</li>
    <li> THis essential oil is already diluted which is not indicated on the label and I find this practice very unfair so if you need a pure oil -don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Small amount for price. Have found same quality and more product for less money.</li>
    <li> LOVEEEEEE Eden&#x27;s Garden oils, their company and their customer care. Fast shipping, excellent products, fair and customer friendly pricing. They have won a loyal customer in me!</li>
    <li> I am newly addicted to finding new and creative uses for lemongrass oil.  People are always asking me what is that great scent?  I look forward to washing my hands with the liquid soap I use it to fragrance. Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> The product is good But not as good as I can purchase here in Phoenix. I have to use more of the oil to get the desired aroma I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll purchase locally from now on.</li>
    <li> Very natural product that is good to use for the skin. It works for what it is intended to work for.Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this. I sprinkle it on clothes and put it in an atomizer. I love the smell when I mix it with other essential oils like lavender.</li>
    <li> This is difficult; I wanted an oil I could use as a fragrance oil, but even mixed with another oil, it made my skin red and&lt;br /&gt;irritated. (The other oil did not do so.)  The only thing I could do,was use it (both oils mixed together), to sent candles.</li>
    <li> I love these oils. I&#x27;m obsessed with these;)</li>
    <li> The lemongrass oil and all of Edens Garden products are great.  They have high quality products at a reasonable price and this one is no exception.  I love doing business with this company.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells wonderful. I am using it to create my own oil blends. Received my order quickly and it was packaged very well to avoid breakage. A generous amount for the price compared to similar products. Definitely will be a repeat customer!&lt;br /&gt;* Disclaimer I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this! Shipping was very fast and product is splendid.</li>
    <li> I love all of these oils. They are strong and last and do what they are intended to do! I&#x27;m a lifetime customer!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to oils and bought several of this brand to start with. They seem good to me, but I&#x27;m a beginner so take that for what it&#x27;s worth. They smell strong and do not look watery.</li>
    <li> this will be great in my soap making</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils.  Especially Lemongrass...it smells AMAZING!!!  Their oils are of the highest quality and absolutely the best prices around.  I could not afford to use essential oils if it weren&#x27;t for Eden&#x27;s Garden.  They have excellent customer service and the oils arrive within a matter of days.  I will only use another company if I need an oil that EG doesn&#x27;t provide.  They are an amazing company and I am a loyal fan.</li>
    <li> Love Eden&#x27;s Garden Products!!! Great prices and product!</li>
