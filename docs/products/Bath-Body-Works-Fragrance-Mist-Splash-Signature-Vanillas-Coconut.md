      <li>Love the smell.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of coconut and wanted a fragrance to wear, but didn&#x27;t want to smell like I was wearing suntan lotion.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Love anything coconut and vanilla.</li>
      <li>you will be ordering more when i&#x27;m finished</li>
      <li>I love this scent.</li>
      <li>Not overpowering, nice and light.</li>
      <li>Vanilla &amp; Coconut are my favorite scents.  </li>
      <li>sincerely wish B&amp;BW</li>
      <li>but it smells pretty good, more vanilla than coconut...</li>
      <li>There are many fragrances that are easy on the nose.</li>
      <li>I figured one would be better than the other, and this was the best, exceeded my expectations.    </li>
      <li>People comment on my scent &amp;#34;everyday!&amp;#34;  Light and refreshing.</li>

      <li>Coconut Vanilla is soft, pleasant and pungent without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>gentle yet effective.  </li>
      <li>so I  thank everyone one for there comments enjoy</li>
      <li>Light fragrance.</li>
      <li>The smell is soft and after about a good 5 hours it smells like a vanilla mist spray.</li>
      <li>I personally wish you could smell the coconut more, the vanilla stands out more than anything.</li>
      <li>I feel like I smell very pretty wearing this.</li>
      <li>The smell is just so perfect and mild for kids and last all day long.</li>
      <li>Great smell if you like a little coconut, even in winter.</li>
      <li>I get compliments all the time on the fresh coconut smell.</li>
      <li>Just yesterday, standing in line, someone next to me told me I smelled nice again.</li>
      <li>Couldnt be more happy with it, sad</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of fragrance, you smell lovely, and you won&#x27;t be bowling anyone over walking down the hallway.    </li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for and it arrived at a decent time.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping</li>
      <li>but I was very upset that one of the bottle came in the package was leaking</li>
      <li>This has such an appealing, soft, balanced blend of coconut and vanilla.</li>
      <li>To contrast the two, the VS lotion was way too strong, and I only put a little on.</li>
      <li>I order two of these bottles which I was a little sketchy because it wasn&#x27;t prime but smells almost the same as the original</li>
      <li>bringing a little summer into the approaching winter ;-)</li>

<li> Its discontiued at bath and body work, and I had a hard time finding it.&lt;br /&gt;Corinth, Ms</li>
<li> I had to wash it off because it was hard to concentrate.</li>
<li> so I ordered this and a Victoria&#x27;s Secret garden coconut passion lotion - to try 2 things out with coconut in it.</li>
<li> Not too much, subtle scent!</li>
<li> /&gt;Not too strong...it&#x27;s subtle with a hint of vanilla!</li>
<li> This smells horrible.</li>

    <li> I love this scent. Coconut Vanilla is soft, pleasant and pungent without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely wish B&amp;BW would bring this back!</li>
    <li> The smell is soft and after about a good 5 hours it smells like a vanilla mist spray. I love it wish I brought more at one time because I use if so much it&#x27;s almost gone!</li>
    <li> I order two of these bottles which I was a little sketchy because it wasn&#x27;t prime but smells almost the same as the original but I was very upset that one of the bottle came in the package was leaking</li>
    <li> Lovely scent, sensual coconut, takes you to the islands!</li>

    <li> favorite scent. Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> I constantly get comments about how wonderful this scent is.  gentle yet effective.  smells like summer or the beach. lasts awhile too</li>
    <li> Light fragrance. Love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leave the house without it!  People comment on my scent &amp;#34;everyday!&amp;#34;  Light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of coconut and wanted a fragrance to wear, but didn&#x27;t want to smell like I was wearing suntan lotion.  This fragrance hit the mark!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too strong...it&#x27;s subtle with a hint of vanilla!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and it arrived at a decent time. I had been looking for this fragrance in stores for over a year and I could only find it on this website.</li>
    <li> This has such an appealing, soft, balanced blend of coconut and vanilla. It&#x27;s not overwhelming at all, yet it lasts all day. I feel like I smell very pretty wearing this. It&#x27;s calming and pleasant.    I wanted something with coconut in it so I ordered this and a Victoria&#x27;s Secret garden coconut passion lotion - to try 2 things out with coconut in it. I figured one would be better than the other, and this was the best, exceeded my expectations.    To contrast the two, the VS lotion was way too strong, and I only put a little on. I had to wash it off because it was hard to concentrate. But this product is just the opposite. It&#x27;s just the right amount of fragrance, you smell lovely, and you won&#x27;t be bowling anyone over walking down the hallway.    Update: I have been wearing this for months now. I did end up buying a 2nd one to keep at work to spray on after lunch. I have gotten so many compliments from people. Just yesterday, standing in line, someone next to me told me I smelled nice again. Great smell if you like a little coconut, even in winter. Maybe that&#x27;s why I like it... bringing a little summer into the approaching winter ;-)</li>
    <li> My sprayer was clogged and it smells like self tanning lotion</li>
    <li> Never ordered perfume online but it smells pretty good, more vanilla than coconut...</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the scent, subtle but yet not too subtle. Definitely would recommend this to anyone wondering about getting it.</li>
    <li> Vanilla &amp; Coconut are my favorite scents.  I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect body spray that smells like true vanilla &amp; coconut. Either alone or combo. Haven&#x27;t found it yet. I detect pineapple &amp; other citruses in this spray. But smells nice, price is good &amp; shipped free.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful thank you will be ordering more when i&#x27;m finished</li>
    <li> Love anything coconut and vanilla.</li>
    <li> Love it! Would eat myself if I could</li>
    <li> I get nothing but compliments, everyone want to know where i get it. Its discontiued at bath and body work, and I had a hard time finding it.&lt;br /&gt;Corinth, Ms</li>
    <li> So glad I found this. It is my favorite but has discontinued. I hope I can find more before they are gone forever</li>
    <li> We have a reentry home for 18 women. There are many fragrances that bother people and I am in fact allergic to many perfumes. One spray of this works great for odors and we use it in place of bathroom spray. It lasts a very long time. There are many fragrances that are easy on the nose.</li>
    <li> I just love the smell of this!  That&#x27;s about all I can say about it, very nice scent and makes me smell so yummy</li>
    <li> Everyone enjoys the smell! I am in the Hospital so I  thank everyone one for there comments enjoy</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and had to order another one when I used it up. I love the smell! Not too much, subtle scent!</li>
    <li> This smells horrible.</li>
    <li> The smell is just so perfect and mild for kids and last all day long. I will purchase again soon</li>
    <li> Ehhhh. It&#x27;s okay. Not very tropical</li>
