      <li>I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for years and loved it.</li>
      <li>Good smell but falls into pieces at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>Because, nothing organic or otherwise does as good of a job as this.</li>
      <li>I have used almost every type of D.O. for my B.O. over the years and have settled on this for good, I hope they keep making it forever.</li>

      <li>This is my ALL time favorite deodorant, besides Aqua Reef, and it smells just like its scent, a Champion!</li>
      <li>No not the fuzzy kind you wear in winter,</li>
      <li>Smells good, works well, what more to say?  </li>
      <li>get my seal of approval, they both kind of smell like you just got out of the shower and</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say it doesnt do the job.</li>
      <li>Great product with great results thus far</li>
      <li>It works better than gels, as good as solids I suppose, but smells better.</li>
      <li>and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found at keeping the pits dry all day, and the scents are good.  </li>
      <li>The sweat Defense holds up well to major activity and the click type applicator is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Been a fan of this deodorant for many years now.  </li>
      <li>For most people you can go with one application for two days.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love them.</li>
      <li>and when I ran out of my favorite, started using it.  </li>
      <li>It uses holes in the top of the applicator to spread out the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt; 2.</li>
      <li>So in some respects it should receive more stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant, and this is my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>It might be the reason we have so many kids...</li>
      <li>3 clicks is perfect for each arm-pit and the smell is not over powering but noticeable when removing shirt even after an entire day of work.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t even able to twist the deodorant up into a usable position because it was stuck.</li>
      <li>it forces a semi-solid through holes in the top.</li>
      <li>Tried many others and none can hold a candle to these.</li>
      <li>Cat&#x27;s and dogs seem to like me more when wearing this deodorant.</li>
      <li>Works pretty good smells good applies and dries up quickly.</li>
      <li>The top is a smooth plastic in the shape of an arc to mimic the shape of your arm pit.</li>
      <li>Hands down one of the best products out there.</li>
      <li>It feels almost like a liquid going on because the holes are so fine</li>
      <li>Smells nice, but I&#x27;ve smelled better for Old Spice.</li>
      <li>and I notice a huge increase in under arm moisture throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Rubs on smooth without hurting.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different ones but this is by far the best I have found</li>
      <li>They are effective (for me) and the various &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; (scents) are nice.</li>
      <li>The scent is noticeable but not overpowering, and is pleasant enough not to smell like deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I can also confirm that they are maling the one w/ the red top and it doesn&#x27;t seam as good as the clear top</li>
      <li>Perfect dryness for a hard working man.</li>
      <li>is okay fast shipping</li>
      <li>My new favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>Good product, I like it as expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the application -</li>
      <li>The package says &amp;#34;extra strong sweat defense&amp;#34; but for me it didn&#x27;t live up to its billing.</li>
      <li>If anyone wants a true, manly scent for the ladies, this one should be in your inventory of deodorants.</li>
      <li>Pleasant scent, not over powering and a few minutes after application its invisible.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s packaged - the top of it has tiny openings, so when you twist the wheel to move it up, it has to go through the holes.</li>
      <li>This makes it so you don&#x27;t sweat in the first place, and if you do, it won&#x27;t smell.</li>
      <li>Avoid the red top.</li>
      <li>Rubs on consistent.</li>
      <li>normally buy the Fresh, Sport, Swagger or After Hours.</li>
      <li>This applies almost like a dry lotion-- absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>It also smells good, like a typical Old Spice product.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite after Old Spice planned on reformulating the Old Spice After Hours.</li>
      <li>I like this one the best out of all the other brands and scents that I have tried in the past.</li>
      <li>The extra strength worse great - smells fine.</li>
      <li>Goes on kind of wet, although it does dry pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>The instructions say that two clicks of the wheel are usually enough for each armpit, and I would say one or two is plenty, as there are times that two clicks made too much available.</li>
      <li>And because of the design of the applicator, you can&#x27;t do much about it except use it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works very well though</li>
      <li>I sweat a lot of under my arms for some reason, even though I don&#x27;t sweat much anywhere else.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like how it comes out.</li>
      <li>Also, while I don&#x27;t like the white chalkiness of it, the consistency is better than (clear) gels - which I dislike more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Definitely a no-go until the go back to the old, good scent.</li>
      <li>I love soft solid antiperspirants!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s by far my favorite deodorant simply because of the applicator design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice scent and works well for a heavy sweating person</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very difficult to find anywhere around here, so I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s available to buy on here.</li>
      <li>, okay, in the first half of the day after a shower, he smells like Old Spice.</li>
      <li>strength items that you can get, but half the cost and much better scent.</li>
      <li>This is my go to deodorant because it doesn&#x27;t get on my shirt and covers better than a regular solid.  </li>
      <li>decent product.</li>
      <li>I have no problems with sweat or odor, and the clicking action lets me evenly measure how much goes under each arm.</li>
      <li>It seems like people are trying to bring this up on Old Spice&#x27;s website, but it&#x27;s really a shame.</li>
      <li>The new red top ones are completely different than the old clear ones.</li>
      <li>Live this line of deodorant/antiperspirant...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the new &amp;#34;RED Cap&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this particular version of Old Spice anti-perspirant for a while.</li>
      <li>It works ok although the deodorant doesn&#x27;t always come up through the holes evenly, not sure if it&#x27;s a manufacture defect or not.</li>
      <li>Generally speaking, i get the Swagger scent over Champion, since this one is very sporty smelling rather than cologne-like.</li>
      <li>The advanced solid goes on like a gel, but is dry.</li>
      <li>I bought a new stick yesterday and they&#x27;ve completely changed the smells to the point where it doesn&#x27;t even smell good or even vaguely resemble the old smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m use to the clear deodorants.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for years and loved it. I bought a new stick yesterday and they&#x27;ve completely changed the smells to the point where it doesn&#x27;t even smell good or even vaguely resemble the old smell. It seems like people are trying to bring this up on Old Spice&#x27;s website, but it&#x27;s really a shame. Definitely a no-go until the go back to the old, good scent.</li>
    <li> I can also confirm that they are maling the one w/ the red top and it doesn&#x27;t seam as good as the clear top</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years but they&#x27;ve recently changed the product. Avoid the red top. Smells horrible and flakes really bad. The new red top ones are completely different than the old clear ones.</li>
    <li> I have bought this for husband for as long as I can remember and it works very well for him. Stops sweat and prevents underarm smell! He is also a soccer player and as a goalie he actually applies this to his hands before he puts his gloves on and it keeps his hands from sweating and extends the wear of his very expensive goalie gloves!</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry all day long, and doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
    <li> No sweat. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my boyfriend but received wrong item and the turn dial used to push product out is missing</li>
    <li> Mistook it for &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent. It&#x27;s nothing like it.</li>
    <li> Perfect dryness for a hard working man.</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot of under my arms for some reason, even though I don&#x27;t sweat much anywhere else. This is the best that I&#x27;ve found for it, but it still doesn&#x27;t work 100%. Smells nice, but I&#x27;ve smelled better for Old Spice.</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant, but it does tend to leave a residue on shirts that needs to be pretreated before washing. It works very well though so I would reccomend it.</li>
    <li> is okay fast shipping</li>
    <li> I like this one the best out of all the other brands and scents that I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soft solid for about 10 years. It&#x27;s by far my favorite deodorant simply because of the applicator design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like it :&lt;br /&gt; 1. Rubs on consistent. It uses holes in the top of the applicator to spread out the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt; 2. Rubs on smooth without hurting. The top is a smooth plastic in the shape of an arc to mimic the shape of your arm pit. So even after applying, this applicator does not have the sharp edges that dig into your skin like others do.&lt;br /&gt; 3. It also comes in several different scents, all of which are female approved.</li>
    <li> Best deoderant/antipersperant that I have found.</li>
    <li> I buy this deodorant for my husband. MMmmm it makes him smell amazing! It might be the reason we have so many kids...</li>
    <li> Good product, I like it as expected. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Been using for a year now.  I prefer the smell over other clinical protection deodorants These are half the price and work the exact same.  I am sold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big guy at all, but in the summer months find that I sweat a lot on the commute to work and when out. This is the old deodorant that keeps me dry-- even when I don&#x27;t wear an undershirt. I also like that its not a solid, and not a gel. Gels are gross and take forever to dry. Solids always leave gross flakes. This applies almost like a dry lotion-- absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> my husband says it doesn&#x27;t last long enough for him.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and works well for a heavy sweating person</li>
    <li> My new favorite deodorant. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing. Scent lasts all day and I got several compliments. No complaints from me!</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant I purchase anymore because it&#x27;s the only&lt;br /&gt;one that works extremely well all day long...&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different ones but this is by far the best I have found</li>
    <li> Cat&#x27;s and dogs seem to like me more when wearing this deodorant. keeps me smelling like i just got out of the shower all day.</li>
    <li> It works better than gels, as good as solids I suppose, but smells better. It&#x27;s basically the same as those &#x27;clinical&amp;#34; strength items that you can get, but half the cost and much better scent. Generally speaking, i get the Swagger scent over Champion, since this one is very sporty smelling rather than cologne-like.</li>
    <li> Been a fan of this deodorant for many years now.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found at keeping the pits dry all day, and the scents are good.  This will remain my deodorant of choice.</li>
    <li> decent product. The new smaller package, actually smaller amount in the same size package makes me run through them way too fast.</li>
    <li> Good smell but falls into pieces at the end of the day. It can last for about 30 hours or so without perspiration.</li>
    <li> Great job, great price right on time.</li>
    <li> on time delivery, product is good</li>
    <li> Live this line of deodorant/antiperspirant...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love them. Tried many others and none can hold a candle to these. They are effective (for me) and the various &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; (scents) are nice. Also, while I don&#x27;t like the white chalkiness of it, the consistency is better than (clear) gels - which I dislike more.&lt;br /&gt;I normally buy the Fresh, Sport, Swagger or After Hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sweater. No not the fuzzy kind you wear in winter, but I simply look at the temperature and can start sweating. I&#x27;m active at home and at work so I needed a deodorant that could keep up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look at the back of any deodorant there is one ingredient that stops you from sweating. (Aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex) this stuff has 19%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I buy regular old spice or another brand they have 14-17% and I notice a huge increase in under arm moisture throughout the day. I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years now and it has never let me down. 4 clicks under each arm in the morning and I&#x27;m good for 24 hours. Pleasant scent, not over powering and a few minutes after application its invisible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a fan of Old Spice products - I use their antiperspirant and body washes a lot. However, this one is slightly different and I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it works as an antiperspirant, so it&#x27;s not a matter of the product itself. It also smells good, like a typical Old Spice product. So in some respects it should receive more stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I won&#x27;t purchase it is the way it&#x27;s packaged - the top of it has tiny openings, so when you twist the wheel to move it up, it has to go through the holes. I prefer to have a solid piece that gets applied, not a bunch of tiny pieces that went through the holes. It feels almost like a liquid going on because the holes are so fine, it makes the material almost powdery. The instructions say that two clicks of the wheel are usually enough for each armpit, and I would say one or two is plenty, as there are times that two clicks made too much available. And because of the design of the applicator, you can&#x27;t do much about it except use it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why they felt the need to do it this way, but it&#x27;s incredibly inconvenient and while the product is fine, they should have just left it as a solid product that you apply as you see fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (8/11/14): I&#x27;ve been using this for two days, and I have a slight rash developing at the point of application. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to antiperspirants, so it might be due to the strength of this specific one. I&#x27;ve only been using 1-2 clicks per armpit, and the instructions say that two clicks is typical.</li>
    <li> I admittedly bought this to get my order over 25 dollars for free supper saver shipping, but when I used it I was shocked at how well it works. My other Adidas deodorant only makes the sweat not smell. This makes it so you don&#x27;t sweat in the first place, and if you do, it won&#x27;t smell. 5/5</li>
    <li> Sweat defense? No. I am a tough customer on this subject unfortunately for me and I can honestly say it doesnt do the job. I needed something stronger like Certain-Dri.</li>
    <li> Smells good, works well, what more to say?  Used to buy a spare stick every time went to the store just in case, but with Subscribe and Save - now I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m use to the clear deodorants. Thought I would give this one a try. It works ok although the deodorant doesn&#x27;t always come up through the holes evenly, not sure if it&#x27;s a manufacture defect or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been told this stuff works wonders... by everyone around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of no-stink sticks and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> The package says &amp;#34;extra strong sweat defense&amp;#34; but for me it didn&#x27;t live up to its billing. This comes out kind of the consistency of cold cream. So for now I&#x27;m back to the &amp;#34;bargain&amp;#34; stuff that appears to keep me dry and smelling nicer.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good smells good applies and dries up quickly.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY. I&#x27;m not sure if these are stored these in a hot room/warehouse or what but my deodorant was completely unusable as if it melted and then re-solidified. I took off the seal for the deodorant and I wasn&#x27;t even able to twist the deodorant up into a usable position because it was stuck. What am I supposed to do with a stick of deodorant stuck inside a plastic tube? VERY UNHAPPY. AGAIN - DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I have used almost every type of D.O. for my B.O. over the years and have settled on this for good, I hope they keep making it forever. The sweat Defense holds up well to major activity and the click type applicator is perfect for me. It is a mix of a gel and solid that is white in color. 3 clicks is perfect for each arm-pit and the smell is not over powering but noticeable when removing shirt even after an entire day of work.</li>
    <li> Great smell!  Long-lasting protection!  I love soft solid antiperspirants!  They are very hard to find...hope I can continue to get them on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is my go to deodorant because it doesn&#x27;t get on my shirt and covers better than a regular solid.  Scents are not overpowering either.</li>
    <li> This product works great. Controls odor and sweat for my 17 year old boy&#x27;s who are very active. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Have always been a big fan of old spice. love the smell, great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular version of Old Spice anti-perspirant for a while. I do not generally sweat a lot, but it keeps sweat and odor away all day without being irritating. The scent is noticeable but not overpowering, and is pleasant enough not to smell like deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the \\&quot;Champion\\&quot; scent, which is hard to find locally-- thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> The best deodorant for the money ever made.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* No skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* Does not defend against sweat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my son who&#x27;s going through puberty.&lt;br /&gt;This has no effect on stinky boy sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Well, okay, in the first half of the day after a shower, he smells like Old Spice.</li>
    <li> they shipped the redtop product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://oldspice.com/en/content/fresh-sweat-defense#ratings-reviews-wrapper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;look at all the bad reviews saying the same thing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;redtop is different product with different ingredients,... fix this problem.  people have allergies to different ingredients you know.</li>
    <li> Great product with great results thus far</li>
    <li> The extra strength worse great - smells fine. I&#x27;m not crazy about the application - it forces a semi-solid through holes in the top. Goes on kind of wet, although it does dry pretty quickly. Not that big of a deal. The only real problem I have is that the crank broke off. I had to jerry-rig a handle to continue using.</li>
    <li> The only product that works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of these scents from the Red Zone Sweat Defense, I&#x27;ve tried Champion and Fresh,&lt;br /&gt;both get my seal of approval, they both kind of smell like you just got out of the shower and they&lt;br /&gt;really do perform well in keeping the sweat inline.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant, and this is my favorite scent. It&#x27;s very difficult to find anywhere around here, so I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s available to buy on here. I have no problems with sweat or odor, and the clicking action lets me evenly measure how much goes under each arm. The advanced solid goes on like a gel, but is dry.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite after Old Spice planned on reformulating the Old Spice After Hours. So if you are looking for a replacement for the After Hours, go for the Champion.</li>
    <li> I had picked this up by mistake for my son [he wanted clear not white content] and when I ran out of my favorite, started using it.  ITT IS GREAT!  For most people you can go with one application for two days.</li>
    <li> Been buying this stuff for years. Always works, doesn&#x27;t cake, last forever. Hands down one of the best products out there.</li>
    <li> my choice for deo all the time</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the new &amp;#34;RED Cap&amp;#34; sticks.  They have changed the scents.  This item is a RED CAP contrary to the photo description.</li>
    <li> Does stain clothing, but protection does outweigh negatives. Suggest undershirts.</li>
    <li> This is my ALL time favorite deodorant, besides Aqua Reef, and it smells just like its scent, a Champion! For some odd reason, I can&#x27;t find this one at any store and if that persists, I may continue to buy from here. If anyone wants a true, manly scent for the ladies, this one should be in your inventory of deodorants.</li>
    <li> Probably the longest lasting deodorant I&#x27;ve used before, but I don&#x27;t really like how it comes out. It comes out grated and not like a typical roll-on. However, if that doesn&#x27;t bother you than you should probably buy this if you get stinky pits like I do. Because, nothing organic or otherwise does as good of a job as this.</li>
    <li> It used to be the greatest deodorant ever.  My last two deliveries, the smell was awful.  I am cancelling my subscribe and save for it.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant out there.</li>
