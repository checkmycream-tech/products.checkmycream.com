      <li>I loved this product the first time I used it when I bought the trail size kit but after using it as recommended (once or twice a week) for a couple of weeks</li>
      <li>i have had microderm and that honestly got me going in the right direction.</li>
      <li>This acne mask is strong - TOO STRONG.</li>
      <li>This is just too strong.  </li>

      <li>It has significantly cleared her skin.  </li>
      <li>Powerful stuff!</li>
      <li>Your skin will feel clean after use.</li>
      <li>Image skin care has amazing products this is no different!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re more sensitive, you&#x27;ll probably have a stronger reaction.  </li>
      <li>After that, my skin looks really clean and healthy the next morning.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING, TCA Peels, Obagi, special laser treatments, blue light, you name it.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this entire skin care line.  </li>
      <li>and it burns when you first put it one</li>
      <li>or esthetician first.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may get redness (and dryness) from using this, so make sure to moisturize properly.</li>
      <li>The item may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  </li>
      <li>Really tones down existing acne and does a good job preventing new break outs.</li>
      <li>this product is amazing to me and i only use it when i feel a breakout coming on or have a breakout and the next day my face is all cleared up.</li>
      <li>I use it as a spot treatment when I have cystic type acne pop up, and it shrinks really quickly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I gave it 2 stars because my skin was much smoother and softer afterward.</li>
      <li>product works very well, and this is much cheaper than at the spa where my wife used to buy this</li>
      <li>My skin is really clearing up with these Image products.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend for very oily skin.</li>
      <li>My face is clear!!!</li>
      <li>and for the girl who has sensitive skin i would have done a test trial first</li>
      <li>Brand new!  </li>
      <li>i highly recommend those who are thinking of buying this to see a phys.</li>
      <li>These products really do perform and have completely transformed my skin.  </li>
      <li>Instead, you would be better off to pick up a Queen Helene mint julep mask for a few bucks for oil control and use a Benzoyl Peroxide gel to kill bacteria.</li>
      <li>This is a heavy duty masque for sure.  </li>
      <li>This mask is too strong with for people with mild acne and it will be painful for people with inflamed more severe acne to use.</li>
      <li>It can be used sparingly which is nice, it will last me a few months.</li>
      <li>I kept it on about 7 minutes and it dried pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Eventually the more I used my exfoliator, the skin started to peel off from those spots but still even after that it was really dry and needed extra attention and extra moisturizer like around 3  times a day!</li>
      <li>4 months ago my dermatologist gave me a sample kit of the Clear Cell.</li>
      <li>I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still not 100 percent clear yet.</li>
      <li>my face is a lot clear now.  </li>
      <li>, I use the vital c line and the ageless face wash without any issues.  </li>
      <li>Product was probably old.</li>
      <li>At age 27 I had onset of adult acne which I have been battling for years, I just turned 34 this week.</li>
      <li>I use this Medicated Acne Masque with the Salicylic Gel Cleanser, Medicated Acne Lotion, and the Vital C Anti-Aging Hydrating Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>so yeah after that experience, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>i am 35 years old and have been to the dermatologist for years.</li>
      <li>Up my skin tremendously , I suffer from acne that doesn&#x27;t create white heads so they stay for a long time and scarring.</li>
      <li>It does leave my face red for a few hours, but that&#x27;s about it! :)</li>
      <li>After I took it off, I could see exactly where I had put the mask because my skin was pink.</li>
      <li>Although  I can say that I have seen a major difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve seen gigantic pimples go from huge to flat skin (and the old dry skin peels off with zero redness!)&lt;br /&gt;Works well for a once a week treatment, dries out acne, helps exfoliate dead skin.</li>
      <li>At first it can burn, but after a few mins that burning goes away.</li>
      <li>If I do, they are small and I attack them right away with this mask.  </li>
      <li>The first time when I used it, the pimples seemed to dry out by the next day but in like day or two I started to notice dark spots on the spots I used this masque.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for when you need you have excess oil.</li>
    <li> Your skin will feel clean after use. It can be used sparingly which is nice, it will last me a few months.</li>
    <li> product works very well, and this is much cheaper than at the spa where my wife used to buy this</li>
    <li> I am acne prone with oily skin. I have my acne under control but get the occasional hormonal or stress related breakout. This acne mask is strong - TOO STRONG. Like other reviewers said, it burned when I put it on and continued to burn. I kept it on about 7 minutes and it dried pretty quickly. When I took it off, it HURT. It literally hurt to try to remove it with water and a wash cloth. This mask is too strong with for people with mild acne and it will be painful for people with inflamed more severe acne to use. After I took it off, I could see exactly where I had put the mask because my skin was pink. I gave it 2 stars because my skin was much smoother and softer afterward. Honestly, I would not recommend this mask. Instead, you would be better off to pick up a Queen Helene mint julep mask for a few bucks for oil control and use a Benzoyl Peroxide gel to kill bacteria.</li>
    <li> This product does help with acne, but takes FOREVER, it dry&#x27;s the acne out so it looks worse then before.</li>
    <li> This product. To me is almost like a peeling. I use as spot treatment and mask all over the face every two weeks follow with a good hydrating moisture lotion... my face is a lot clear now.  I&#x27;ve been using for 2 months. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Smelled horribly.  Product was probably old.</li>
    <li> Great product with great results!</li>
    <li> I used it once, have what appear to be 1st degree burns on my face, this was last weekend.  My skin is peeling and hurts to put moisturizer on, forget about makeup it flakes off.  I love Image, I use the vital c line and the ageless face wash without any issues.  This is just too strong.  I would run this by a dermatologist before you buy.  I only left it on for a minute or two.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a week , I&#x27;m probe to really bad cystic acne on my chin and have scarring on my cheek , this is helping a lot no new breakouts skin looking better , using this 2 times a day 10 minutes</li>
    <li> As an Esthetician, I would only spot treat. Use it for the recommended time because its very active. Do not use over night, you will wake up with scabs on your skin.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST spot treatment for acne ever! It shrinks my hormonal cystic acne better than anything else!</li>
    <li> I love this mask. It definitely works wonders for oily skin. My face is never left too dry. My face feels really good after using this mask.</li>
    <li> Should have listened to other reviewers in regards to purchasing Image Skincare from Amazon.  I do not doubt that this is the authentic product.  It was however, resealed and only about half of the product is actually there.  The tube is creased where it has been squeezed and manipulated previously.  Would recommend purchasing these products only from an esthetician.  Will not purchase on Amazon again.  The product itself is quite fantastic!</li>
    <li> At age 27 I had onset of adult acne which I have been battling for years, I just turned 34 this week. I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING, TCA Peels, Obagi, special laser treatments, blue light, you name it. I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars trying any and everything. 4 months ago my dermatologist gave me a sample kit of the Clear Cell. I was afraid to try it initially, but in my frustration I decided it couldn&#x27;t get any worse, why not give it a try. IT WAS MIRACULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally!!!!!!!! My face has cleared up! Where I had 10+ blemishes, I now have 2. I&#x27;ve been using the whole system and at times while traveling or when I was too tired didn&#x27;t use the mask, I saw a difference and my face will get congested in 1 day. Needless to say I wear the mask every night and it must be working because my face is staying clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, give the sample kit a try - it&#x27;s worth a shot! I would have saved a lot of time and money had someone given me this years ago.</li>
    <li> I loved this product the first time I used it when I bought the trail size kit but after using it as recommended (once or twice a week) for a couple of weeks my skin felt so thin a fragile. My toddler barely scratched my cheek by accident and it left an awful scab. My skin was like paper and so dried out. Not to mention I got the biggest under the skin pimples (or I should probably call them lesions or boils) that I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. I was horrified. They said it would get worse before it got better but after 3 weeks of having to go to work looking like a monster (in my opinion) and the painful irritation, I refuse to put this on my skin again. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> nice stuff recommend to everyone this skin care line its a hidden secret that&#x27;s gonna blow all others away!!!! NO lie</li>
    <li> I am sad to report that I purchased this product and it made my acne soooo much worse. I had 3 very small acne lesions and they increased 10 times in size and they got infected!! YES, INFECTED!!!!! I used a very small amount (spot treated) and used only as directed on 3 seperate occassions and I could not believe what this product did to my skin. It was so bad that I&#x27;ve been to my estisican 3 times this week and it&#x27;s still not 100 percent clear yet. Also, buyer beware, not all the ingrediants are listed on their website, so if you choose to buy this product, be sure you look at all the ingrediants once you receive it. I&#x27;ve also tried to return the product and they won&#x27;t take it back...I will never buy any products from this company again and will be sure to spead the word to others about it..This product does not even deserve one star, but I had no choice, I had to rate it...BEWARE, I am an acne suffer and I truely thought this was going to be a good product and I am warning everyone, please look for a different product, don&#x27;t let their ad convince you otherwise, it&#x27;s no good nor is their customer service.</li>
    <li> I am a Licensed Esthetician in my late 20s.  I&#x27;ve suffered with breakouts (not acne, though sometimes my breakouts have been severe) and oily skin my entire life.  I was introduced to Image Skin Care by a friend of mine who is also a licensed esthetician.  I use this Medicated Acne Masque with the Salicylic Gel Cleanser, Medicated Acne Lotion, and the Vital C Anti-Aging Hydrating Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the masque, there will be a \\&quot;burn\\&quot; or \\&quot;tingle\\&quot;.  If you&#x27;re more sensitive, you&#x27;ll probably have a stronger reaction.  This is a very active masque.  It truly works and like another reviewer said, it&#x27;s almost like a peel because after you use this masque, you may notice some slight peeling of your skin, depending on how long you left this on your face.  If you follow the instructions and leave the masque on only for 5-10 minutes, the peeling effect should be minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this as a spot treatment overnight.  The blemish is almost always completely dry by the following day, sometimes I need another night of spot treatment.  The spot/blemish I treat always peels for a few days afterwards, but it&#x27;s nothing hideous or ugly and is easily covered up with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as an overall facial mask once a week.  I believe this mask has helped with my hyperpigmentation on my cheeks.  I am in love with this entire skin care line.  These products really do perform and have completely transformed my skin.  My pores are noticeably minimized, my oil production has decreased so my skin no longer looks oily or greasy, and I almost never, ever get blemishes anymore.  If I do, they are small and I attack them right away with this mask.  I&#x27;m obsessed with Image Skin Care!</li>
    <li> Love it! Started using it every other day because I am having a breakout. Once things calm down I will go down to once a week. I used it as a spot treatment as well for a few hours, until it started burning. Powerful stuff! I made the switch from Bio Elements and am very happy!</li>
    <li> Have mostly used this product directly on break outs to help heal them faster - works great for that!  Would recommend for very oily skin.</li>
    <li> Really tones down existing acne and does a good job preventing new break outs. I sometimes put it on problem areas and leave it there overnight. When i wake up the pimple is completely dried up!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has acne.  It has significantly cleared her skin.  We are very happy with the results.  She also uses dermologica for skin care.</li>
    <li> Yeah it burned mostly on my nose because I was pinching blackheads before I put the masque on. I know...gross.  But we all do it don&#x27;t we?  After just one use of the Masque, I can see a difference.  In fact I&#x27;m peeling on the corners of my nose.  This is a heavy duty masque for sure.  You can feel it sucking out the dirt and oil.</li>
    <li> I started using this my aesthetician  recommended  it. It has cleared. Up my skin tremendously , I suffer from acne that doesn&#x27;t create white heads so they stay for a long time and scarring. But this stuff is amazing. I use it twice a week and it burns when you first put it one but the beads give a good exfoliation . They are a bit hard so of you don&#x27;t like that you might not like this. Although  I can say that I have seen a major difference in my skin. I also use this as a spot treatment and they are usually gone by the next morning. I use the entire line and would never go for anything else</li>
    <li> Awesome. Love it, great cleanser and face wash trusted name brand and product I totally recommend it to face washers</li>
    <li> Works incredibly well. I use it as a spot treatment when I have cystic type acne pop up, and it shrinks really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may get redness (and dryness) from using this, so make sure to moisturize properly. And don&#x27;t leave it on for longer than noted, or your skin will be angry.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and get acne spots sometimes, like maybe around a 1-2 small pimples in a week or so. Still, that bothered me a lot!I heard about this product and decided to give it a try but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!!! The first time when I used it, the pimples seemed to dry out by the next day but in like day or two I started to notice dark spots on the spots I used this masque. and it was really uncomfortable and itchy and it looked burned for almost around a week. even layers of makeup didn&#x27;t cover it. Eventually the more I used my exfoliator, the skin started to peel off from those spots but still even after that it was really dry and needed extra attention and extra moisturizer like around 3  times a day! so yeah after that experience, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I have been using it for years...can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. So happ to see it on amazon!</li>
    <li> The item may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle of this item. Amazing. My face is clear!!!</li>
    <li> My skin is really clearing up with these Image products.  I love that I can use this mask just as a spot treatment every night.</li>
    <li> Image skin care has amazing products this is no different!</li>
    <li> Awesome ! Brand new!  Works amazing! Perfect for anyone with acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t bother my skin almost at all (I have sensitive/acne/rosacea). At first it can burn, but after a few mins that burning goes away. It does leave my face red for a few hours, but that&#x27;s about it! :) After that, my skin looks really clean and healthy the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;Is amazing for spot treatment, I&#x27;ve seen gigantic pimples go from huge to flat skin (and the old dry skin peels off with zero redness!)&lt;br /&gt;Works well for a once a week treatment, dries out acne, helps exfoliate dead skin.</li>
    <li> I had to write a review because i read the couple that were bad and thought maybe my opinion would help. i am 35 years old and have been to the dermatologist for years. my acne comes and goes. i have had microderm and that honestly got me going in the right direction. it helped with black heard and scars but i had about 20 treatments. i went to a spa and the esthetician used this product on me it did tingle and burn alittle but i noticed the next day the pimples i had demenished alot. i highly recommend those who are thinking of buying this to see a phys. or esthetician first. and for the girl who has sensitive skin i would have done a test trial first it sounds like you left it on to long. this product is amazing to me and i only use it when i feel a breakout coming on or have a breakout and the next day my face is all cleared up. something that might work for someone might not work the same for another person. it doesnt mean the product is horrible. it just didnt work for you. move on and try something else like i have done for 20 years. but i have finally found this and it works for me so i give it 4 stars.</li>
