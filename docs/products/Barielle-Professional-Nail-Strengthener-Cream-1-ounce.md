### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best nail cream I&#x27;ve ever found - at any price!</li>
      <li>Perfect.....</li>
      <li>Bottom line: very good product but seller</li>
      <li>My wife saw a lot of good reviews for this, so she decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product</li>
      <li>Love this cream!</li>
      <li>Best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>look much better</li>
      <li>I have just started on the bottle so can not be sure.</li>
      <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this nail cream, however, when it arrived</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the results; my nails are improving significantly.</li>
      <li>Based on past experience, I fully expect to have excellent results within a week or two.</li>
      <li>True to it&#x27;s advertising</li>
      <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s the only product that helps to strengthen my nails.  </li>
      <li>My wife uses it for her nails to keep them strong and she is able to grow them out very long</li>
      <li>To me this is the same as the straight lanolin you used to be able to buy.  </li>
      <li>I did not have much faith in this product at first.  </li>
      <li>Not so much.  </li>
      <li>a week 1/2 later, I have significant regrowth and recovery of a damaged nail and all the rest of my nails</li>
      <li>So far that hasn&#x27;t improved as much as my skin, but I&#x27;m willing to keep trying.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s when I started using the Barielle products and to my complete amazement, my nails have gotten stronger, and are looking pretty again.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about how strong and long this cream makes my nails grow.  </li>
      <li>This appears to be old product.</li>
      <li>If you want to grow natural nails or heal and repair your nails from acrylic damage, this is the product for you.  </li>
      <li>BARIELLE PROFESSIONAL NAIL STRENGTHENER CREAM.  </li>
      <li>So far, it seems to be doing the job of repairing my cracked nails.</li>
      <li>But when I started using it at least once a day, I was surprised and convinced that it really makes my finger nails grow strong (and long, if desired).  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this product - the only draw back is the amount you get in the jar.</li>
      <li>will re-order in near future.</li>
      <li>Maybe this is old stock, or Professional is different than regular Barielle Nail Strengthener Creme.</li>
      <li>, now as before, it works fast and extremely well.  </li>

<li> , now as before, it works fast and extremely well.  </li>
<li> I have very dry skin around my fingernails and the skin, especially the pads, around my thumbs dries and cracks in the winter.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for several months due to nail damage form acrylic nails &amp; &amp;#34;no-chip&amp;#34; manicures.</li>
<li> it was not a fresh, white cream.</li>
<li> but what I received is yellow &amp; dried out.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way!</li>
<li> Have to agree with several others - it&#x27;s yellowish and like a hard waxy substance.</li>
<li> I hadn&#x27;t used this product since the late 80&#x27;s, but I recently ordered it, as my nails were needing help, post acrylics.  </li>
<li> so I know that signals this product is past its prime.</li>
<li> Had to request a refund of the item as it came as a thick paste and not the usual creamy emollient product I&#x27;m used to.</li>
<li> I use it at least twice a day.</li>
<li> Mad such a difference in my nails and cuticles.</li>
<li> Because of Thyroid disease my nails are weak and brittle.  </li>
<li> sent me an outdated product.</li>
<li> For years I have had the artificial nails and when I decided to see how my natural nails were doing, I found them in horrible condition.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, although she used it for 3 weeks, it still didn&#x27;t work for her.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Have to agree with several others - it&#x27;s yellowish and like a hard waxy substance. It states on box to shake before using!!!! Would NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how strong and long this cream makes my nails grow.  This is the best nail cream I&#x27;ve ever found - at any price!</li>
    <li> If you want to grow natural nails or heal and repair your nails from acrylic damage, this is the product for you.  It WILL grow and strengthen your nails.  Period.</li>
    <li> Had to request a refund of the item as it came as a thick paste and not the usual creamy emollient product I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin around my fingernails and the skin, especially the pads, around my thumbs dries and cracks in the winter.  This is the only thing that has stopped the drying!  I ordered it for my thumbnail, which has a vertical crack that just won&#x27;t go away.  So far that hasn&#x27;t improved as much as my skin, but I&#x27;m willing to keep trying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Barielle product for years. Honestly, it&#x27;s the only product that helps to strengthen my nails.  I keep it by my bed, and apply it before going nite nite.</li>
    <li> My wife saw a lot of good reviews for this, so she decided to try it.  Unfortunately, although she used it for 3 weeks, it still didn&#x27;t work for her.</li>
    <li> For years I have had the artificial nails and when I decided to see how my natural nails were doing, I found them in horrible condition.  That&#x27;s when I started using the Barielle products and to my complete amazement, my nails have gotten stronger, and are looking pretty again.</li>
    <li> Have used this for prob 20+ years. Best I&#x27;ve found so far. Will continue to use- cant find retail anymore.</li>
    <li> Because of Thyroid disease my nails are weak and brittle.  Barielle helps to relieve these symtoms so I don&#x27;t have to hide my hands in puiblic!</li>
    <li> Perfect.....working well already and will re-order in near future.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used this product since the late 80&#x27;s, but I recently ordered it, as my nails were needing help, post acrylics.  True to it&#x27;s advertising, now as before, it works fast and extremely well.  The only change I see is the color, which used to be peach and now is white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now - a week 1/2 later, I have significant regrowth and recovery of a damaged nail and all the rest of my nails look much better and, I think, stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product - the only draw back is the amount you get in the jar.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this nail cream, however, when it arrived it was not a fresh, white cream. It was a yellowish, waxy type of consistency.  I&#x27;ve used this product for 25 years so I know that signals this product is past its prime. I did not return it, but I considered it.  Bottom line: very good product but seller sent me an outdated product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for several months due to nail damage form acrylic nails &amp; &amp;#34;no-chip&amp;#34; manicures. I apply several times a day &amp; always at bedtime. I am pleased with the results; my nails are improving significantly.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it for her nails to keep them strong and she is able to grow them out very long</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff; We have several settings where we have to pause and let her cover her nails with this for strength and thickness</li>
    <li> So far, it seems to be doing the job of repairing my cracked nails. I use it at least twice a day.</li>
    <li> Maybe this is old stock, or Professional is different than regular Barielle Nail Strengthener Creme. This was sort of waxy instead of creamy.</li>
    <li> Used for about 2 weeks and nails are no longer splitting.</li>
    <li> I feel it has helped my nails to be stronger.  I have just started on the bottle so can not be sure.</li>
    <li> BARIELLE PROFESSIONAL NAIL STRENGTHENER CREAM.  I did not have much faith in this product at first.  But when I started using it at least once a day, I was surprised and convinced that it really makes my finger nails grow strong (and long, if desired).  Recently, I have not been using it  (excuses, excuses...), and my nails have returned to their &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; breaking/splitting.  Started using it again. Based on past experience, I fully expect to have excellent results within a week or two.</li>
    <li> I am still using it...Unsure if it is helping</li>
    <li> This appears to be old product. It is to be a white  cream but what I received is yellow &amp; dried out.</li>
    <li> To me this is the same as the straight lanolin you used to be able to buy.  Is it the miracle cure for cuticles?  Not so much.  It&#x27;s a good product but if you find the same ingredients for cheaper go for that.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Mad such a difference in my nails and cuticles. I only use it at bedtime as I do find it a tad bit greasy. A little goes a long way!</li>
