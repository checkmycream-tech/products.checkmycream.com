      <li>If you love body butter (like I do) then you will love this rich creamy lotion.</li>

      <li>This cream is truly like silk, it just smoothes over the skiing easily.</li>

      <li>The silkiest most efficient cream ever ,it s not sticky and get absorbed by the skin quickly , like all dove product just excellent ,just wish we can find it in local stores</li>
      <li>good smell.good for normal skin.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes amazingly well, very creamy.</li>
      <li>This cream isn&#x27;t available in the stores where I shop</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, creamy not oily</li>
      <li>There is no scent and it makes my skin feel silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also lightly scented.</li>
      <li>It is smooth and creamy but incredibly light.</li>
      <li>It is a bit thinner than I imagined since it is labelled a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; but I am not disappointed in this at all.</li>
      <li>Very lightly scented and very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a good sized jar so it should last quite a while.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream and I am so glad it is now available on Amazon as I had to carry back from England with me in order to use it.  </li>
      <li>SUPER Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>use sparingly, nice big jar;  will last a good while.</li>
      <li>So nice my skin is so soft and it&#x27;s really noticeable.</li>
      <li>I usually prefer unscented, but this cream has a light, pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t offensive.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly but leaves a pretty sheen on the skin but isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>I used it for the first time while traveling in Italy</li>
      <li>Traditionally, I&#x27;ve been able to access this product through travel; whether at duty-free shops at airports abroad or at shops in the destination country -- until I shopped at Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although, I wish it came in a bigger jar so there would be more.</li>
      <li>and I really like this!</li>
      <li>It allows it to last longer since it spreads more smoothly and thinly but moisturizes amazingly well.</li>

      <li>It has a nice clean smell similar to other dove products.</li>
      <li>Its very moisturizing without leaving that greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Love this cream, it&#x27;s super thick but absorbs really fast!</li>
      <li>It is a super light cream and vanishes into the skin almost instantly leaving my skin soft without any dryness ( and I live in the desert).  </li>
      <li>It feels great going on and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>As I get older, I find I really need a cream rather than a lotion, which isn&#x27;t rich enough.  </li>
      <li>It smells lovely and conditions your skin perfect especially for those cold winter months and the smell and softness last all day.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have stated, it absorbs quickly and makes my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>What I expected, arrive on time.i have longed for this cream finally it is here am loving it.</li>
      <li>I was curious to see how this product worked since I am a huge fan of Dove soap.</li>

      <li>I am in a swimming pool several days a week, and this product really makes a positive difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as rich as some other body creams I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>Wow wow wow!</li>
      <li>I will definitely continue to buy for me and the whole family.</li>
      <li>and I was surprised to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I apply directly after I bathe and my partner loves to rub my skin now.</li>
      <li>and it leaves my skin feeling really soft.</li>
      <li>I use this once a day and it makes my skin so soft.</li>
      <li>You only need a small amount because it&#x27;s so rich</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin soft all day long, but never sticky or greasy.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m glad I was browsing amazon&#x27;s website.  I didn&#x27;t realize Dove made body creams.  LOVE LOVE this product</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I always keep a spare jar because I never want to run out of it!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and this cream is great - great scent and not greasey</li>
    <li> I love this product!! Too bad it&#x27;s not available in the States!!! I discovered this product during a trip to London. I walked into a drugstore and there it was. I was curious to see how this product worked since I am a huge fan of Dove soap. Within a few days my skin felt noticeably softer and looked extremely healthy. Its very moisturizing without leaving that greasy feeling. Oh! and it smells like Dove&#x27;s original soap, which I love!!!</li>
    <li> Will buy it over and over.</li>
    <li> I used this for my hands, its really good,,</li>
    <li> I do like this and by the reviews I thought I was getting something different.  No huge different than any other drug store lotion</li>
    <li> Really Nice, Buy for my younger sister and she recommended to buy this with having good quality @nd experience.</li>
    <li> Love this cream, it&#x27;s super thick but absorbs really fast!</li>
    <li> It is not what you advertised. I returned the product. It says Body Silk like I already have and you sent me Dove Silky. It is not even close to the same texture or product. Yours is the top one and mine is the bottom one in the picture below.</li>
    <li> So nice my skin is so soft and it&#x27;s really noticeable. Although, I wish it came in a bigger jar so there would be more.</li>
    <li> This cream is truly like silk, it just smoothes over the skiing easily.</li>
    <li> good smell.good for normal skin.</li>

    <li> Great moisturizing product!  Not too greasy and just a little is all you need.</li>
    <li> My family loves Dove Silky!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizing cream.  I used it for the first time while traveling in Italy and I don&#x27;t know why it is not carried in stores in the USA.  It is very light and not greasy at all!  It feels great going on and a little goes a long way. There is no scent and it makes my skin feel silky smooth.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Very lightly scented and very moisturizing.  I am in a swimming pool several days a week, and this product really makes a positive difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I hVe very dry skin and I really like this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many creams; however, this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried. All Dove moisturizing products are not as moisturizing as is this cream. Often, It feels greasy and heavy after application. With this product, I don&#x27;t experience, either. It&#x27;s also lightly scented. Traditionally, I&#x27;ve been able to access this product through travel; whether at duty-free shops at airports abroad or at shops in the destination country -- until I shopped at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that if you like Dove products, you should try Dove Silky nourishing Cream. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This cream is very moisturizing and is quite thick and luscious, a far cry from regular Dove lotion.  As I get older, I find I really need a cream rather than a lotion, which isn&#x27;t rich enough.  This cream is lightly scented with a nice feminine scent but it dissipates quickly and therefore doesn&#x27;t interfere with whatever perfume I choose to wear that day.  It absorbs quickly but leaves a pretty sheen on the skin but isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  It isn&#x27;t as rich as some other body creams I&#x27;ve used but it works well.  This cream isn&#x27;t available in the stores where I shop and I was surprised to find it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s more expensive than the body creams I usually buy from TJ Maxx but I decided to try it anyway. You only need a small amount because it&#x27;s so rich and it&#x27;s a good sized jar so it should last quite a while.  When I get to the end of the jar, I will likely decide to repurchase it. I definitely can recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wow wow wow! I absolutely love this stuff! I wish they sold it in stores! If you love body butter (like I do) then you will love this rich creamy lotion. It smells lovely and conditions your skin perfect especially for those cold winter months and the smell and softness last all day.</li>
    <li> love it so much its the BEST moisturizing lotion I have ever use. I love all dove products and it came as it said.</li>
    <li> Great customer service with this order and the product is superb!! I paid for shipping from the UK because they don&#x27;t package it like this in the US. Well worth it!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Moisturizes amazingly well, very creamy. its scent isn&#x27;t too strong, suitable for the face not just the body.</li>
    <li> The silkiest most efficient cream ever ,it s not sticky and get absorbed by the skin quickly , like all dove product just excellent ,just wish we can find it in local stores</li>
    <li> The Dove Body Silk Moisturizing Cream is an amazing product from the Dove series. This cream is nourishing and non-greasy. It is too bad that this product is not sold in stores so hopefully Amazon will continue to carry this product for purchase. I will definitely continue to buy for me and the whole family.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body lotion. It is smooth and creamy but incredibly light. It is a bit thinner than I imagined since it is labelled a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; but I am not disappointed in this at all. It allows it to last longer since it spreads more smoothly and thinly but moisturizes amazingly well. It has a nice clean smell similar to other dove products. I like that I can wear perfume with it and it doesn&#x27;t clash. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful! Leaves my skin soft all day long, but never sticky or greasy. I only wish it were fragrance-free. The scent isn&#x27;t bad, I just prefer fragrance-free for body creams. It is probably o.k. to use on your face but I don&#x27;t because my eyes are too sensitive to use anything other than coconut oil on my face. But this cream is excellent as a body cream. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this cream and I am so glad it is now available on Amazon as I had to carry back from England with me in order to use it.  It is a super light cream and vanishes into the skin almost instantly leaving my skin soft without any dryness ( and I live in the desert).  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream!  Skin absorbs it very quickly, makes it feel nice and silky.</li>
    <li> Awesome...I just love it....</li>
    <li> What I expected, arrive on time.i have longed for this cream finally it is here am loving it.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t a product that I will purchase again.  My skin is very dry and this is not greasy which is a plus but it doesn&#x27;t provide the moisture that I need.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! I ordered 2 and mixed Eden&#x27;s Garden lavender oil in it to give it a flower scent. I use this once a day and it makes my skin so soft. I apply directly after I bathe and my partner loves to rub my skin now. It&#x27;s light, creamy not oily what so ever. No more ash for me!</li>
    <li> The best European lotion one can ever have!!! Too bad it is not sold in the US. Hopefully one day it will be and it will have the same scent!</li>
    <li> One of the best creams I have used in years. It has a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> best skin cream  ever!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it&#x27;s smells really good and it leaves my skin feeling really soft.</li>
    <li> this stuff is luxurious. is no need to spend more. And it smells heavenly.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful, very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling!!</li>
    <li> Wish I had gallons of this to take a bath in!  It is that luxurious and heavenly.  As other reviewers have stated, it absorbs quickly and makes my skin soft and smooth.  I usually prefer unscented, but this cream has a light, pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t offensive.  I will never be without it if Amazon continues to carry it.</li>
