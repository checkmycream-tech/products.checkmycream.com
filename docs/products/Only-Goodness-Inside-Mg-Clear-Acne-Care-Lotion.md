### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is good!</li>
      <li>This is the best deodorant that I have used for many years and is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  </li>
      <li>both the area and my pores looked great when I used it.</li>
      <li>This might work great for some people, and I don&#x27;t want to discourage anybody from buying it for that reason.</li>
      <li>It works great without overly drying out skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great weapon to have in the arsenal.</li>
      <li>so I had a great opportunity to try it out.</li>
      <li>You will love it!!</li>
      <li>On the plus side, though, it is very effective.</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, and I&#x27;m happy for them!</li>
      <li>They might be \\&quot;pricier,\\&quot; but they are effective (and so luxurious!).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, and I&#x27;m happy for them!</li>
      <li>I, surprisingly, did not have any problems using it.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a good remedy.</li>
      <li>The My Goodness Deodorant is just as good as the one</li>
      <li>She was asking to get more, so that&#x27;s a good sign!</li>
      <li>She also likes another acne treatment she was using that was effective in reducing her persistent acne</li>
      <li>I liked that my skin seems brighter, fresher after I used it.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would be effective for blackheads.</li>
      <li>It is organic, it is in a convenient applicator, it has great packaging ... and, most importantly ...</li>
      <li>I wish I liked this product more, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The reasons I deducted two stars is I thought it would be more effective given its concentrated formula</li>
      <li>Effective, safe, and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a safe, effective product to help control acne,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bummer that this (the deodorant) doesn&#x27;t come with an applicator since this is a pretty great product</li>
      <li>I think this is a better treatment for aging skin that still gets some acne as it is gentler over time.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
      <li>think the packaging could be better designed</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a person who goes for the more</li>
      <li>is more when trying to get rid of a blemish, so I applied this liberally and often.</li>
      <li>I love that this product is all-natural and is even labeled as edible.</li>
      <li>I used this on the T area, as this like for many women is where my face gets oily.</li>
      <li>That jar lasted for many, many months - perhaps over a year.  </li>
      <li>and I suppose it&#x27;s safe to say that I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the elusive miracle cure.</li>
      <li>I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>I am totally in love with this product</li>
      <li>With the cracking and peeling, I&#x27;m almost sure to scar.</li>
      <li>When it came time to get some more, we were both heartbroken to find that that company had since gone out of business</li>
      <li>Maybe others will have better luck :</li>
      <li>or you can use more and use it as a mask over an area.</li>
      <li>I was really pleased with this acne lotion...</li>
      <li>Otherwise I do think that it&#x27;s a good product and definitively worth a try if you&#x27;re suffering from acne.</li>
      <li>It probably depends on what brand you might have around as to the comfort and shape, but I&#x27;ve got an old Tom&#x27;s of Maine that works great.</li>
      <li>because again, I know my skin dries out so easily.</li>
      <li>In a welcome change from most acne treatments, this one actually helps.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it will help heal your breakouts, but the smell is really strong.</li>
      <li>However,  did smell a bit strong for me.</li>
      <li>used Mg Clear as a spot treatment successfully.</li>
      <li>It arrived just before a huge cystic acne popped up on my chin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth &amp; rounded.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s chemical free-salacylic acid free</li>
      <li>However, it does cause a stinging sensation upon contact and it wasn&#x27;t comfortable.</li>
      <li>It makes my face smooth &amp; clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and plastic, and non-porous, so</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or breakouts since using this product as part of my daily routine.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>Clear Acne Care is something that I feel good about using.</li>
      <li>have fair and sensitive skin</li>
      <li>good thing was that there were no bad reactions and no dry skin, etc.</li>
      <li>It is more effective than the Neutrogena blackhead facial scrub that I used to use and this product seems more gentle.</li>
      <li>Lucky for me, I got a blemish when this arrived</li>
      <li>The scent is not unpleasant, but it will announce to the world that you&#x27;re treating a skin problem.</li>
      <li>After all if you are looking at this product you&#x27;re probably pretty familiar with them yourself or you&#x27;ve seen them erupt and invade the face of your teenaged child.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and looks healthy.  </li>
      <li>This is why I love Ole Henrikson, Juice Beauty, and Lush.</li>
      <li>I really liked My Clear because products like this work really well with my skin.</li>
      <li>That is pretty much true of any deodorant for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The print is too tiny for my eyes to read effectively and the label design makes the bottle look like it came from a swimming pool store.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I think it&#x27;s worth the result.  </li>
      <li>I started using it right away.</li>
      <li>Granted, the product *does* say to moisturize right away after using it....</li>
      <li>I went off birth control after a couple years because it seemed like my face had finally tamed, and I had also been eating (and still do eat) very clean (whole foods, gluten free, no processed junk, etc).</li>
      <li>My first response the first time I used</li>
      <li>It must be mentioned that this product now listed is the acne cream, not the deodorant, though most of the reviews are for the latter.</li>
      <li>make it go away fast!).</li>
      <li>FAST!</li>
      <li>I found this to be more effective than Clearasil for me because I seem to need multiple reapplications over multiple days with the Clearasil and the Mg Clear</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I saw no difference in this product and any other I have used.</li>
      <li>a week or so later, I realized that my face had more redness to it in my T-zone than normal.</li>
      <li>It certainly helped me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, I really wanted to like this product.</li>
      <li>Mg Clear is worth considering.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, I really wanted to like this product.</li>
      <li>As stated in my title, I really appreciate products that try to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and keep the ingredients to a minimum/clean.</li>
      <li>It reduced my acne along my neck reasonably fast.</li>
      <li>Still, I don&#x27;t really like talking about them with people I don&#x27;t know very well...</li>
      <li>But...it isn&#x27;t helping with the redness I have as much as I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
      <li>products containing Benzoyl peroxide really did not help me much.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>this one seems to work gently.</li>
      <li>so I can control how much comes out at one time -</li>
      <li>Do not use this with any additional acne creams or even face washes (just use a gentle soap or beauty bar and water to wash your face) in order to prevent over-drying and skin reddening/irritation.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing to reduce the size or redness of the acne and it continued to grow until it reached the size of a pencil eraser.  </li>
      <li>It dries up the pimples and reduces redness very well.</li>
      <li>really did stop my zits in their tracks.  </li>
      <li>I bought it as more of a deep cleanser and because it promised to clear up redness.</li>
      <li>The first main problem with the product is that I could not read the directions on the bottle, not even with my new glasses.</li>
      <li>I do get the occasional breakout, and this product seems to be drying them up quite nicely, and I&#x27;ve only tested it on my adult skin -</li>
      <li>It really is effective in reducing oily skin and small blemishes.</li>
      <li>I started with the spot treatment on some new cysts, and noticed that it was very drying.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I sadly get breakouts still, even though I&#x27;m in my 20s. I used this as a face mask (though it says you can leave it on spots overnight) a few times a week, and I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference. I&#x27;m rating it three stars because it didn&#x27;t work for me, but I liked that it didn&#x27;t have a lot of weird ingredients and also everybody is different. This might work great for some people, and I don&#x27;t want to discourage anybody from buying it for that reason.</li>
    <li> This will be our go-to blemish cream from now on.  It works great without overly drying out skin.  My tween daughter has sensitive skin, and it caused no irritation or redness and her pimple was gone by morning! Amazing!</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I saw no difference in this product and any other I have used. I used it as a spot treatment overnight, and there was no significance difference compared to Proactiv, which I have used for years.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product at first, but I&#x27;ve used it every night for a couple weeks, and I&#x27;ve noticed softer, clearer, less irritated skin, so it must be doing something right.  Usually when I find a product that works this well, I wind up with chapped skin or my eyes swell shut.  None of that has happened with the Mg Clear lotion.  I apply a thin layer before I go to bed, and I don&#x27;t rinse it off 15 minutes later.  It&#x27;s gentle enough, at least for my skin, that I just leave it on all night.  Smell-wise, it isn&#x27;t unpleasant.  It definitely isn&#x27;t medicinal.  Its smell vaguely conjures up memories of art class when we&#x27;d work with clay.</li>
    <li> I opt for natural products in all situations where the product is comparable or better than the conventional version. This is why I love Ole Henrikson, Juice Beauty, and Lush. They might be \\&quot;pricier,\\&quot; but they are effective (and so luxurious!). Ditto for less glamorous products. Still, here, it&#x27;s difficult to find any way to justify the price. After numerous uses, I did not see any positive effects (at all). (And, the bottle looks like something I would find sitting atop a fish tank ... maybe redesigning the packaging could also help?)    For me, I am always willing to pay extra for natural/organic products. However, they MUST work and they MUST work well. I just did not find that to be the case here.    If you are seeking an alternative to this, try [[ASIN:B001I83RHG Juice Beauty Blemish Be Gone, 0.27 fl. oz.]]. It is organic, it is in a convenient applicator, it has great packaging ... and, most importantly ... it WORKS ... FAST!</li>
    <li> Lucky for me, I got a blemish when this arrived so I was eager to try it(and make it go away fast!). I&#x27;m in my mid-30s and just hate that I still have breakouts now and then. I liked that this was natural and was a big fan of the ingredient list since it&#x27;s all natural things I typically use, like zinc and apple cider vinegar. I started using it right away. While it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin too badly, it also didn&#x27;t help my zit(which wasn&#x27;t cystic but still not pretty). I&#x27;m a person who goes for the more is more when trying to get rid of a blemish, so I applied this liberally and often. I tried it a few other times for different levels of breakouts but honestly it doesn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
    <li> I used this on the T area, as this like for many women is where my face gets oily. It really is effective in reducing oily skin and small blemishes. I was hoping it would be effective for blackheads. It has made a slight difference on my nose, so it might continue to shrink them over time. It is more effective than the Neutrogena blackhead facial scrub that I used to use and this product seems more gentle. The reasons I deducted two stars is I thought it would be more effective given its concentrated formula and I thought it was a bit overpriced for this size bottle.</li>
    <li> I really liked My Clear because products like this work really well with my skin. It&#x27;s similar to Mario Badescu in that you can use a bit on a q-tip and dab it on and have the spot dry up or you can use more and use it as a mask over an area. It&#x27;s white and opaque so you might not want toleave the house with it on and it probably won&#x27;t go well under make up (I didn&#x27;t try). It&#x27;s chemical free-salacylic acid free so it&#x27;s really dead sea salts and manganese that&#x27;s shrinking the spots but both the area and my pores looked great when I used it. It&#x27;s a tiny bottle so using it as a total face mask, well, it won&#x27;t last long. It can be drying so they recommend using a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My 18 year old daughter really likes this product.  She had a breakout, and after using this product, was clear within a day or two.  She was asking to get more, so that&#x27;s a good sign!</li>
    <li> It must be mentioned that this product now listed is the acne cream, not the deodorant, though most of the reviews are for the latter. It&#x27;s a bummer that this (the deodorant) doesn&#x27;t come with an applicator since this is a pretty great product but personally I have improvised by using the cap of an old deodorant stick. It&#x27;s smooth and plastic, and non-porous, so if you squeeze a small amount of the Only Goodness onto the curved outside lid of a regular deodorant cap, you get a reasonable &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34; with no wasted product and a smooth, thin, even application of the product. It probably depends on what brand you might have around as to the comfort and shape, but I&#x27;ve got an old Tom&#x27;s of Maine that works great. It&#x27;s smooth &amp; rounded. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> But...it isn&#x27;t helping with the redness I have as much as I&#x27;d hoped for. Oh well. I do get the occasional breakout, and this product seems to be drying them up quite nicely, and I&#x27;ve only tested it on my adult skin - no teenagers around my household to test it on. The product does go on very dry (with a slight odor) and can be used as a topical treatment, or thinly spread as a mask of sorts for about ten minutes and then rinse and have a good moisturizer ready afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the packaging could be better designed, I&#x27;d prefer a pump so I can control how much comes out at one time - I either don&#x27;t get enough and then I end up getting too much, and it is a fairly expensive skin product. I was also glad to find the instruction on the Amazon page, because the font color and background on the bottle were impossible for this oldster to read.</li>
    <li> Product seem to work well. It reduced my acne along my neck reasonably fast. However,  did smell a bit strong for me. It&#x27;s a tad expensive,  but seems to be well worth the price.</li>
    <li> In my opinion the product is a little high priced considering the small amount that you&#x27;re receiving.  Otherwise I do think that it&#x27;s a good product and definitively worth a try if you&#x27;re suffering from acne. it has a mild pleasant odor, and even though he&#x27;s only been using it for a few days it has almost completely cleared up my hubby&#x27;s back acne.</li>
    <li> As stated in my title, I really appreciate products that try to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and keep the ingredients to a minimum/clean. I wish I liked this product more, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, let me say that I have very stubborn, cystic, adult acne. It didn&#x27;t start for me until mid-college, and I tried just about everything from a dermatologist, except Accutane. When I went on birth control, it finally helped ease the flare-ups. I went off birth control after a couple years because it seemed like my face had finally tamed, and I had also been eating (and still do eat) very clean (whole foods, gluten free, no processed junk, etc). This past summer, my face started to spaz out of control again, and so I went back on birth control and topical creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;m using BC &amp; creams, my face still isn&#x27;t as controlled as it used to be. I had the chance to test out this product (with the expectation of leaving a review in return) and jumped on the opportunity- I am always in desperate searching of acne products that work for me (and don&#x27;t have scary ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This acne cream can be used as a leave-on-then-wash-off face mask, or you can use it as an overnight spot treatment. I started with the spot treatment on some new cysts, and noticed that it was very drying. Granted, the product *does* say to moisturize right away after using it....but I noticed that was almost too drying for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even try the recommended amount of use for the face mask- it seemed excessive- because again, I know my skin dries out so easily. I used it as a mask here and there.....a week or so later, I realized that my face had more redness to it in my T-zone than normal. I couldn&#x27;t figure out the cause other than possibly this product, because I was using nothing else new/hadn&#x27;t changed my routine otherwise. I stopped using it for awhile and the redness went away; I started using it again and I just noticed the redness was back today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I really wanted to like this product. I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, and I&#x27;m happy for them! But if you have skin/acne like me- very stubborn acne and easily dried out skin- I can&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Herbal Blemish Stick on cysts that I can feel forming, and while it&#x27;s not an instant fix, it does seem to help (and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year as needed).redness was back today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I really wanted to like this product. I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, and I&#x27;m happy for them! But if you have skin/acne like me- very stubborn acne and easily dried out skin- I can&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Herbal Blemish Stick on cysts that I can feel forming, and while it&#x27;s not an instant fix, it does seem to help (and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year as needed).</li>
    <li> In a welcome change from most acne treatments, this one actually helps.  However, it is a bit more trouble to use than the typical cream.  After washing your face, you apply this to the effected area, leave it on for 15-20 minutes, then wash the area again and apply moisturizer.  So you can&#x27;t just &amp;#34;apply and forget&amp;#34; like the cheaper lotions (that don&#x27;t work anyway).  Also, don&#x27;t use this in conjunction with any other treatment.</li>
    <li> I cannot use things with Salicylic acid as it will give me a facial peel!&lt;br /&gt;Using products containing Benzoyl peroxide really did not help me much.&lt;br /&gt;But this one seems to work gently. Haven&#x27;t had a breakout or any burning sensation since I started using this. It makes my face smooth &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;It has a bit an unpleasant scent though.&lt;br /&gt;I have only tried this for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Will update if needed in the future.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with this acne lotion...but why am I a little embarrassed to talk about pimples? After all if you are looking at this product you&#x27;re probably pretty familiar with them yourself or you&#x27;ve seen them erupt and invade the face of your teenaged child. Still, I don&#x27;t really like talking about them with people I don&#x27;t know very well...so I&#x27;m going to be somewhat vague about the specifics of my pimples.  Let me just say that I noticed three on my face one night before bed and I put this lotion on and the next morning they were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair and sensitive skin so your results and experiences may vary from mine.  This lotion does sting or slightly burn when it&#x27;s first applied to the skin.  But I think it&#x27;s worth the result.  I have used Clearasil for decades and the sting from it is similar.  I found this to be more effective than Clearasil for me because I seem to need multiple reapplications over multiple days with the Clearasil and the Mg Clear really did stop my zits in their tracks.  It&#x27;s a great weapon to have in the arsenal.</li>
    <li> I have occasional out breaks though not any form of persistent acne.  I seem to break out after a cold or a stressful time when I believe that my resistance is low.  I received this product at just the right time (after finally fighting off the &#x27;flu and having the resultant break out.)  I liked that it was a very gentle product since my skin usually reacts to harsh chemicals.  I used as directed and it worked.  It cleared my skin in much less time than it ordinarily takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for how it works with severe acne but for someone like me, who breaks out on occasion, I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Adult onset acne is no joke. Having had clear skin as a teen, I was left with no idea how to treat acne in my 30s. I&#x27;ve used different products with varying degrees of success and I suppose it&#x27;s safe to say that I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the elusive miracle cure. This is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This it a small bottle. The price for what you receive is ridiculous. But, had it been the miracle cure the other reviews claim, I would have paid twice the amount listed to continue using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this twice as a mask and quite often for spot treatment. I saw no results as a mask, using a 1/4 of the bottle each time. It did seem quite effective in drying my skin out in spot applications, leaving the pimple area dried out, cracked, peeling and painful, even with liberal use of moisturizer afterwards. But the pimple itself remains. More angry and noticeable than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t care if a product is natural or full of chemicals, as I&#x27;m only interested in the end result. My skin is worse than when I started using this product. With the cracking and peeling, I&#x27;m almost sure to scar. Natural does not mean better in this case, just more expensive.</li>
    <li> Yes, it will help heal your breakouts, but the smell is really strong. I would only use this at night and when I didn&#x27;t need to be around other people. The scent is not unpleasant, but it will announce to the world that you&#x27;re treating a skin problem. On the plus side, though, it is very effective. If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, and you don&#x27;t use it so often that it dries your skin out, it&#x27;s a good remedy.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. It arrived just before a huge cystic acne popped up on my chin so I had a great opportunity to try it out. I applied it twice a day after washing my face.  It did absolutely nothing to reduce the size or redness of the acne and it continued to grow until it reached the size of a pencil eraser.  I didn&#x27;t have any reactions to the product.  After a week I gave up and used some Retin A on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I did not see any benefit from this product but on a positive note I didn&#x27;t have any bad reaction to it.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is all-natural and is even labeled as edible. A nutritionist once told me to never put anything onto my body that I wouldn&#x27;t put into my body. It is hard to find natural skin care products that truly are natural. This Only Goodness Inside Mg Clear Acne Care is something that I feel good about using. It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin screaming for relief. It isn&#x27;t overly drying and I had no adverse reactions when using it on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I do know that sometimes natural products take a little longer to work than chemical products, but the health benefits are worth the wait for me.&lt;br /&gt;Good price for a nice size bottle, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This item was given to me for my review.&lt;br /&gt;Only Goodness Inside, Mg Clear Acne care is an odd product, and I am not actually reviewing it as an acne product. I bought it as more of a deep cleanser and because it promised to clear up redness. The first main problem with the product is that I could not read the directions on the bottle, not even with my new glasses. I cannot tell if I was using the product totally correctly. I put it on, let it sit for several minutes, about five, and then I washed it off. My first response the first time I used it was, &amp;#34;Aaaaargh!!&amp;#34; It burned. I think I got a concentrated dose of whatever the key ingredient is that is in it (ginger, it smells like). Other uses did not burn like that. The product did leave my skin feeling smoother, and I, surprisingly, did not have any problems using it. I liked that my skin seems brighter, fresher after I used it. I am not sure if I would buy it....maybe, if it comes in a bottle where I can read the labeling.</li>
    <li> I used this product as a nightly mask treatment. I have some persistent adult acne, that comes and goes, and occasional redness.  This product contains some ingredients that I like for treating inflammation on my skin: aloe vera, dead sea salts, and witch hazel.  This product has a pleasant odor and a small amount treats my entire face.  It stings a little on application and dries quickly.  It does take a little work to get all the product rinsed off, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any over-drying or other problems.  My skin feels soft and looks healthy.  So far, so good.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or breakouts since using this product as part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Mg Clear is an acne drying mask or spot application treatment using all natural ingredients. It has a light fragrance that reminds me slightly of Noxzema skin cream. The liquid is white, spreads thin very easily, and can cover a large area with only one drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Mg Clear as a spot treatment successfully. Whenever my face would get an itchy spot or tell-tale redness showing a new pimple is trying to emerge, I dab a spot on it. By the next morning, I no longer have the irritation and any pimple that was trying to form has disappeared. This is good! I continue to use it with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re concerned about the size of the bottle. Don&#x27;t be. This stuff goes a LOOOONG way. One small drop can actually be too much for spot treatment. This little bottle will go the distance if used wisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are superficial. The print is too tiny for my eyes to read effectively and the label design makes the bottle look like it came from a swimming pool store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goods on Mg Clear:&lt;br /&gt;- Effective, safe, and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way. You are definitely getting a lot of bang for your buck despite the small bottle size.&lt;br /&gt;- All natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;- Quick results on less severe problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not so great:&lt;br /&gt;- Tiny print/instructions&lt;br /&gt;- It looks like something you would buy at Pinch-a-Penny Pool/Spa store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a safe, effective product to help control acne, Mg Clear is worth considering.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have not noticed any results when using this. Tried it like a mask and as a spot treatment, according to directions and it was like not treating the pimples at all. No results what so ever. Maybe others will have better luck :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing was that there were no bad reactions and no dry skin, etc. It was basically like just not using anything at all.</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by the idea of a 100% natural product for acne treatment, so I ordered this to give it a try. I have occasional breakouts and this product seems to work for me. It dries up the pimples and reduces redness very well. It has the consistency of a thick white cream. I put a small dab on my hand and apply it to the acne on my face. However, it does cause a stinging sensation upon contact and it wasn&#x27;t comfortable. It takes a short while for the sensation to go away. The scent is not unpleasant and does not really bother me..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product that does what it advertised, without using harsh chemicals such as benzoyl peroxide or alicylic acid. The bottle is small but only a small dab is needed, so it will go a long way. The price isn&#x27;t bad neither. The only gripe I have with it is the initial stinging sensation on my skin. Other than that, it does dry up the breakouts and reduce the redness somewhat. Good product.</li>
    <li> This was written by my stepdaughter who was dealing with issues of adult acne:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;If you have had poor success with acne treatments at your local pharmacy or grocery store, you may have better results with this one. Unlike your average acne cream, which contains salicylic acne wash as its active ingredient, this treatment contains active ingredients such as Dead Sea minerals, which “draw out” the acne bacteria that is deep within your skin. So if you have adult acne, (usually caused by hormonal changes in your 20’s and 30’s) or if you’re a teen who has had poor luck with over the counter acne treatments, give this one a chance!  It certainly helped me.  However, I caution you to try this medication SEPERATLEY from other treatments. Do not use this with any additional acne creams or even face washes (just use a gentle soap or beauty bar and water to wash your face) in order to prevent over-drying and skin reddening/irritation.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This mineral preparation has a helpful drying action and minerals that provide a hostile environment for infection. Simple and useful.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant that I have used for many years and is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  One  drop on a fingertip under each arm lasts for days!  There&#x27;s no scent, no mess, no deodorant stain to ruin my clothes and the beset part is you stay stinky-free for days!  The only caveat  to this product is make sure that it isn&#x27;t applied to broken skin - I would avoid it for at least a day after shaving.  That is pretty much true of any deodorant for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several years ago, at an herbal conference,, my herbal mentor and I happened to get some deodorant that was in a  cream-form and was  in a very small jar. That jar lasted for many, many months - perhaps over a year.  When it came time to get some more, we were both heartbroken to find that that company had since gone out of business and there was no product to be found anywhere.  The My Goodness Deodorant is just as good as the one my mentor and I had used before. I am totally in love with this product and  I highly recommend it .  have let my herbal mentor know about this product and I am definitely going to reorder it for myself!  My advice is to just get some! You will love it!!</li>
    <li> There is no salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide in this product, usually the main ingredients in any acne treatment. It has natural ingredients including dead-sea minerals. Magnesium is the main ingredient, followed by potassium, calcium, aloe vera, jojoba oil, grape seed oil, witch hazel, silica, dead sea salts, Himalayan pink salt, apple cider vinegar, zinc etc. It claims to dry out acne but also nourish and detoxify the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on the bottle are hard to read, but the Amazon page gave the instructions that it is to be applied for 15-20 minutes only on the whole face (up to 2 times a day) or it can be left on overnight for spot treatment. This is key for this product to work and not irritate the skin. Since the product goes on white, it is advisable to put it on at night but remember to wash it off before you go to sleep. I would not leave it on for more than half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;The spot treatment works for a pimple to dry it off but is not as quick as salicylic acid based products that act as a drying micro-peel and bring results overnight. It does work over time to smoothen the skin, absorb excess oil, reduce redness and make your face smoother. It’s overall gentler for the skin that the salicylic acid based products.&lt;br /&gt;In 2-3 times of using it, my daughter’s face is smoother and she has reduced redness. She also likes another acne treatment she was using that was effective in reducing her persistent acne but this one is gentler. I think this is a better treatment for aging skin that still gets some acne as it is gentler over time.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
