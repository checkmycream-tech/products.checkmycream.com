      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>Now my short haircuts are much easier to do and look good.</li>
      <li>Snapped right onto my Wahl trimmer that I have had for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is also made a little thicker and stronger ... more durable for sure ...</li>

      <li>After a few months, it&#x27;s still effective.  </li>
      <li>This is the only comb I use on my 2 dogs and they have destroyed the one that came with the original</li>
      <li>I have an older Wahl Home Cut model.</li>
      <li>brand new in plastic</li>
      <li>Finally an actual whal guard and not some off brand generic guard that doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>Wanted to have a second one just in case the first one broke.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little wider than the one I had before, but it seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>My Wahl is about 20 years old.</li>
      <li>One haircut so far.</li>
      <li>This works just like the old one.  </li>
      <li>It is just like the old one in every way.</li>
      <li>nice replacement for my broken onel</li>
      <li>Looks to be a slightly different material (or different manufacturing process) than the original one that came with my clippers (that mysteriously disappeared) but it clips on properly.</li>
      <li>I am only replacing it because I lost my old one.</li>

    <li> Was as stated and works as expected</li>
