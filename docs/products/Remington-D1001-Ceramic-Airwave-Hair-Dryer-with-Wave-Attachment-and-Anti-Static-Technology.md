<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have medium-long medium-thick hair with some natural wave.  This unit is a very nice hair dryer but I am not sure that the results from the wave attachment are worth the trouble.  It takes considerably longer to fix my hair this way, because you have to separate the hair into small sections. Each section is twirled inside this wind tunnel which twists it into a rope - a la dread locks.  But once you run your fingers through it the waves are very gentle/minimal/sublte, not strong waves and not anywhere near curls.  I could get this same degree of wave by just applying product and scrunching with a diffuser or letting it air dry.  If I&#x27;m going to spend 30 minutes styling my hair I would rather use hot rollers to have more of an effect.  Maybe because my hair is already somewhat wavy this didn&#x27;t make a big impression.  If your hair is very straight and flat then perhaps the waves would be more noticeable.  My results were very similar to the picture on the box (very subtle waves, but more volume) and the video example.</li>
    <li> This dryer is amazing!! I have naturally curly long hair and it has always been a challenge to a get a good curl that holds all day. This works like magic.. just make sure you use plenty of product and start drying when hair is still wet. I&#x27;ve noticed that the longer you wait to dry your hair, the more natural frizz you may end up with. Also, I&#x27;ve experimented with the size of the piece of hair you dry and you can do as few as 4 or 5 pieces and end up with large curls, or do numerous small pieces and end up with a ton of small curls! We also played around with a friend&#x27;s straight hair and ended up with beautiful waves that looked nothing like curling iron \\&quot;waves\\&quot;. I highly recommend this dryer--- it is totally affordable and IT ROCKS!!! :D</li>
    <li> I have stick straight shoulder length hair and was thrilled at the thought of having any kind of wave.  I was skeptical about this working on my type of hair but read many reviews from people with my hair type that loved it so I gave it a try.  It took me 30 mins to dry my hair with the wave attachment (my hair usually dries in 10) and I was left with a tangled matted mess!!  I did not think I&#x27;d ever get the knots out.  I ended up having to rewash and restyle my usual way.  A waste of time and money :(</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews and doing my own research about this product, I decided to finally purchase it. Not only was it a GREAT deal, but it actually worked! At first I was skeptical, but when I tried it I was blown away. It works fantastic! It was easy, fairly fast, and it gave me the perfect look that I&#x27;ve always wanted. I even slept on the waves overnight and they were still intact the next day (without any product.)   In my opinion this works better to create waves than any other product I&#x27;ve tried (curling irons, crimpers, etc.) I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;m SO glad I got it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sooooooooooo happy that I purchased this item! It works great at creating waves...I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my hair after I&#x27;ve used it. I would recommend this to everyone! :)</li>
    <li> This is a decent hair dryer - though after several months it seems to be less effective than it was when we got it.  Just considered as an ordinary hair dryer it works quite well.  The fan blows strong, the heat level is just right, there&#x27;s a nice button for switching to \\&quot;cool\\&quot; blow for a moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are handy.  The thin one gets the air moving focused and hot.  The \\&quot;wave attachment\\&quot; works quite well, and adds quite a bit of waviness and body to long hair.  My daughter liked that feature, and it added some flair to her ordinarily quite straight hair.  We are all happy with the dryer overall.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer will make your hair wavy if you have medium length straight-ish hair. It takes a long time to do it. You have to go all around your head, dropping chunks of hair into the tube attachment, which whirls them around till they have a wave. My husband thought my hair looked good. My daughter thought my hair looked messy. I haven&#x27;t repeated the process, though I don&#x27;t rule it out.    I also purchased a waving iron around the same time as this product. The waving iron works faster but the results of the Remington airwave are much more natural-looking.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer really does give those beachy waves. I have thick but fine, straight hair. When I use this dryer I have soft waves and lots of volume even in my long hair. It does take a little longer than a regular dryer but worth it!</li>
    <li> If you want voluminous wavy hair, this dryer is fabulous! The only downside is that it takes 45 minutes to 1.5 hours to style my medium length fine hair using the wave attachment. The waves are soft, look great, and hold all day. If you can set aside the time to use it, it&#x27;s a great investment!</li>
    <li> Totally skeptical when I saw the videos for this hair dryer but got my sister one anyways. The first time I tried it out, I was somewhat happy with it but the more I use it, the more I love it! I bought one for myself and all of my roommates love it and use it too. I can do my hair in 5 min and have it looking great!</li>
    <li> I have long wavy hair that I usually blow dry with defuser and am able to make soft curls.  I thought by purchasing an using this hairdryer it would cut my drying time and create effortless curls as advertised.  This was not case.  The hairdryer is awkward to hold and my hair kept popping out of the tube which only cause frizzy curls.  I returned the Remington D1001 Ceramic Airwave Hair Dryer with Wave attachment.</li>
    <li> This is a nice and useful dryer to have. The hair dryer itself feels solid, drys the hair well and and feels light. It has 3 heat settings and the hair dries pretty quickly; the cold air button is also useful for touch ups to avoid frizzies. The attachment does create some waves but don&#x27;t expect salon style result. It&#x27;s minimal and one needs to have some practice to curl really well. I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t review this product since it never arrived, and there seems to be no other way to clear this from my Vine \\&quot;products to review\\&quot; page. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember the last time I used a machine to dry my hair. Usually I just towel dry it or let the air take care of it. I am a guy with shoulder length hair and it&#x27;s generally complimented on so I&#x27;ve stuck with my usual pattern for years at it&#x27;s never done me wrong.    I picked up the Remington D1001 to review simply because it was outside my usual comfort zone. Why not try something new? The price here on Amazon seems like a great deal compared to other hair dryers I have seen, especially with all the attachments that comes with this one.    The hair dryer worked nicely. It never fried or frizzed my hair. However the fun came with the attachments. To test out the wave attachment on my already naturally wavy hair, I enlisted a few of my female friends to style my hair, which they have all been waiting to do for years \\&quot;Can I put your hair in a french braid?\\&quot; &#x27;No, I&#x27;m a guy. Why would I want a french braid.&#x27; So my friends from the other gender persuasion loved the wave attachment and the following photos they now have of me for blackmail or other nefarious reasons. The wave attachment didn&#x27;t really do anything more my hair but make it a bit poofier, but I generally have to straighten my hair when it&#x27;s not in a ponytail, so I&#x27;m sure it will work better for others.    All in all, an excellent purchase for the dollar amount, but it will probably be better off in the hands of a lady than a gentleman.</li>
    <li> The Remington emi worked just like the ads said it would.  For the first time, I have curls.  And they last all day.  I found it easy to use.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does, creates waves. I would have preferred a little bit more wavy instead of the tousled look a little bit more. It doesn&#x27;t have as much power and I would like. Overally though, it does deliver what it says.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! You just put a section of hair in the little attachment and move the dryer up/down. Your hair isn&#x27;t actually wrapping around anything--it just has this tornado effect from the dryer. I shoot it with cold air and after a few minutes I fluff my hair &amp; have beachy hair waves. The curl lasts all day! It is amazing &amp; works so easily. My hair actually seems healthier &amp; shiny. Love Love Love It! PS: Use some beach spray like Philip B. Maui Wowie or Blow NY Beach Spray...makes the dryer work even better.</li>
    <li> I needed a new hairdryer but kept telling myself my old one was good enough. I finally got this one, and it&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s small and lightweight, yet sturdy. It has multiple settings, including a great \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting that works well on wavy/curly hair.  The hairdryer also comes with what I would call a diffuser -- a snap-on device for drying longer waves and curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got everything I needed in one hairdryer, and am really pleased!</li>
    <li> The nice thing about the Remington D1001 Emi is that, for women who are looking to get some curl into their long hair without having to use a lot of other chemical products, they can just pop on the Wave attachment and put those strands of hair and get them all swirly and wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, there&#x27;s not much that&#x27;s really innovative, but it&#x27;s a good solid buy.</li>
    <li> The Remington D1001 Emi hair dryer is a specialized hair dryer. It can be used as a basic hair dryer, and it does include a concentrator attachment, but its selling point is the wave attachment.     The attachment is supposed to replace your curling iron or hot rollers. You slip an inch of hair through the attachment, turn on the drying function, and then finish it with a cool shot.     So how does it do? For my hair, not well. First, it was hard to get my hair through the attachment, especially the back strands. Your hair kind of spins in the attachment, which is supposed to lead to waves, but they left me with mostly straight hair with a few tangles in there.     As a basic hair dryer, it&#x27;s fine. It feels solid in your hands and is powerful. I like that it has three heat settings rather than the usual two, and there are real differences between the heat settings, unlike some hair dryers in which low and high feel basically the same. A diffuser would have been very nice to include to give it more versatility.     But you can get a good basic hair dryer for much less. I currently have the [[ASIN:B00005O0MZ Conair Full Size Ion Shine 1875 Watt Hair Dryer]] which includes a diffuser and concentrator and costs significantly less.     Bottom line: I think your money would be better spent on a less expensive basic hair dryer with a concentrator and diffuser, along with some heated curling rollers.     *Disclosure and Possibly Relevant Info*    I received this product to review for free. I was not paid for this review, but I did get the product free.     I have thick straight black hair about four inches longer than shoulder length.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!! This is the best dryer out there! I&#x27;ve never had an ionic hair dryer before so I was totally surprised by how silky my hair felt after using it. The curling attachment is super easy to use and absolutely works! Just dry your hair near the roots till it&#x27;s just damp and section your hair evenly, the resulting little dreads are almost too adorable to comb out! Go slowly as you finger comb each dread once its cool so that you don&#x27;t cause knots, then presto! Your hair turns out as though it was braided root to tip, very beachy and natural. This was a great purchase and the best price out there!</li>
    <li> I have stick-straight fine hair that NEVER curls unless I spend a whole night and day in old fashioned sponge rollers. And I didn&#x27;t expect this dryer to work... but it does!!  I just finished using it for the first time to see what happened and even with my less than perfect sectioning, my hair has great, relaxed, natural looking waves!  It was really easy, I LOVE this dryer. Only next time, I might start or finish by drying the top of my hair as usual for a bit more body.  But I look forward to experimenting.   In addition to the curling feature, the dryer itself is nice--it&#x27;s powerful and gets the job done.   If it can get my hair to do something other than hang there, it will work for you too!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have lots of fun creating cool looks with this dryer.  I especially like to use it to separate her hair so that we can make long spiral curls with the curling iron.</li>
    <li> Item is being used by my 16 year old daughter.  She has naturally wavy hair to begin with but this gives her super wavy curls.  Wife is please with it as just a regular hair dryer.  It worked well getting the wrinkles out of window covering kit as well.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would help me get out of the door quicker with more fantactic hair than my normal ponytail or completely wet head I let dry out during the day. I think because my hair is longer, it takes too long to dry. I found that if you don&#x27;t dry it completely, your hair comes out looking like bedhead which I could have achieved on my own. It also looks frizzy and knotted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use it on my neice who has short hair and it worked fantastic on her and of course because of her short hair it dried very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the blow dryer without the attachment. It is a nice blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I may still need to tweak around with using it. I&#x27;m trying different products to avoid the frizz factor, letting the hair set longer and different techniques to get the whole hair shaft dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars because if you like expiermenting and have the time to do it, this might just work for you. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it however if you are looking for a quick easy way to style your hair.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this dryer, but I needed a new one and I figured that it would be worth the $25.00 even if the attachment didn&#x27;t work. I was pleasantly surprised by how great the wave attachment works. It really does make pretty waves with very little effort. I will say that you should probably allow your hair to dry a little before using the attachment so your hair is not soaking wet. Also, using some mousse helps the curl last longer. I am really impressed by how much you get for the money!</li>
    <li> I love this blowdryer so much. Ive tried everything to get those beachy effortless waves in my hair. I have tried curling irons, straightening irons, 3 barrel wavers, pillow rollers, bendy rollers, braiding, bunning.. This BY FAR does the best job with the least effort. Dry your roots with the concentrator provided then the dry the rest of your hair until it is 85% dry. Then I just section my hair into 8, place them in the barrel for about 30 seconds and it looks great after. It takes me around 10 minutes to do my entire head from stepping out of the shower. The bigger the sections placed in the barrel the looser the waves are. I scrunch them with hair wax after and it lasts all day! By the way, I have pin straight, thick hair that is up to my chest.    BEST INVENTION EVER!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice blow dryer, and does add volume to my hair, which is difficult to keep waved or styled.  Every little bit helps and this dryer does the job.  It does take a little getting used to, and I&#x27;d be happier (5 star) if it weren&#x27;t so bulky and awkward.</li>
    <li> If you want the look of curly ringlets, body wave and don&#x27;t have the time to use rollers or a curling iron. This is great for making straight hair curly! Can also be used as a regular hair dryer, but FYI the curling attachment only fits this hair dryer. It also has 3 heat settings (low, med, high), a cool shot button, and low/high speed air flow.  Durable construction except be careful of the attachment when storing as it&#x27;s a bit more fragile so don&#x27;t put or store anything heavy on it or with it or protect it somehow when traveling. I highly recommend this product. I even bought one to have on hand if they ever discontinue it.</li>
    <li> I had stick straight hair when I was younger, and then post-puberty, it got some wave, but not an attractive amount.  This hair dryer makes my hair look amazing.  With wet hair, I add some curl spray, then let it air dry 50% or more. Then I divide it in 4 sections and within 4 minutes, I&#x27;m done.  I used to blow out my hair maybe twice a year before I found this dryer - I hated going to all of the trouble.  This makes life so simple.  Thank you Remington. I am buying a back up in case this one dies.  I can&#x27;t live without it!!!  BTW, my hair is pretty fine (thin) and past shoulder length.</li>
    <li> I needed a new hairdryer and this was on special, so I thought why not. I read through all the other reviews to get a feel for how this worked before I tired it out. It actually worked the first time I used it. My hair is almost shoulder length, fine, and thin. I washed and conditioned my hair like usual. I used phomoliant with a drop of anti-frizz serum, mixed them up, and applied evenly throughout my hair. I pulled out my longer side-swept bangs  and put them where I wanted them and just let the rest of my hair air dry until it was slightly damp. I did not section off my hair. I have no patience or coordination for that type of thing. I did lift the upper layers and put them over the top of my head as I dried 1-2 inch sections with the wave attachment. I used it on the hot setting for about a minute and then I used a cold blast for a few seconds. I did the sides and top of my hair first. Then I moved to the back of my hair, which i found to be more complicated because I could not see it. I started at the top and worked my way down. I used a mirror to make sure I got the entire back of my head. I noticed that some my hair was in longer wavy strands and some of it was in little bun like curls. I am not sure why it was so random. It could have been the angle of the dryer? I left my hair like this while I got dressed. Then I ran my fingers through my hair. Wow! Did I have the most amazing waves and body ever! Nothing ever curls my hair, but this did it for me. The smaller the sections, the curlier the hair. The larger the sections, the wavier the hair. It was surprisingly easy to use and didn&#x27;t take much longer than a regular blow dry. It was certainly much quicker than drying and using a curling iron. I recommend this tool for anyone that is not talented with using hair tools and has a hard time getting their hair to curl. My waves last three days at a time!</li>
    <li> These are no longer for sale, and I want to buy one so badly.  My friend lent me her Remington D1001, and now all I want is find one for sale somewhere.  If you want to sell yours please reply to this comment and we will work something out.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because I cannot buy one!</li>
    <li> Noise level is very low.  The antistat feature works great. The wave attachment we have only been able to try minimally because both of us have relatively short hair, so we have to defer that to other reviewers.  It can&#x27;t give waves to hair as short as ours.    Overall, this is a fantastic hair dryer. Don&#x27;t plan on taking it in your carry-on luggage, and don&#x27;t expect it to fit in a small place, it is bulky.      A quality hair dryer with great features that is a delight to use.</li>
    <li> While my hair is unfortunately too short to use the waving attachment (and might look goofy on a male!), I deferred to the expertise of my sister on the ability of the dryer to dry long hair.  She is really not just an expert in name, as she has owned a number of hair dryers, including the expensive types that I have no experience with.    She was really blown away (ha ha, sorry) by the Remington D1001.  The most impressive feature was the ability to quickly dry the hair without causing damage.  It is also a good weight, though the large size may be offputting to some.  Still, as this model is not advertised for travel, I can only give it my highest recommendation.    Thanks sis!  If any issues arise over time with durability, I will update this review.  Things have gone well so far with months of heavy use.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used the concentrator and it feels like the one the lady at salon was usin. i haven&#x27;t use the other attachments. I&#x27;ve an ionic dryer i hate cuz it dries my hair out and i get breakage. This one isn&#x27;t like it and since i got it, i haven&#x27;t used my old dryer. Things i love: it&#x27;s easy to use, quick drying for thick hair like mine, and it&#x27;s so easy to use i sorta straigten my hair hair while using it and i only have to use the flat iron once. I haven&#x27;t found anything i hate so far but if i do, i&#x27;ll come back and edit this review. For the price, it&#x27;s sooo worth it!</li>
    <li> Upon reading the reviews on here, I decided to give this a try A - because it was cheap and B -  I like the wavy hair look. I have really long highlighted hair and I must say, even using it without the attachment, my hair dries much smoother than my other hair dryer, and fast! The Airwave attachment takes a little getting used to, I agree with tips from previous reviewers, and I do dry the bangs/roots first before using the Airwave. But it really makes nice, full waves that last through the day even with very long hair! Excellent find :)</li>
    <li> I bought this to help my eternally straight hair. The thing is, it takes SO long to do every twist. Plus your arms get tired. Not fun. Kind of sucks. I think it would be easier to twist strands, bobby pin and sleep!&lt;br /&gt;It works great as a hair dryer and the &#x27;cold air&#x27; shot helps to not damage my hair but all in all, not worth it to me!</li>
    <li> This was touted on online forums as *the* way to get lovely beachy waves. The machine does twirl the hair into the vortex area and it does apply heat while it&#x27;s being spun. My super-long fine hair did not appreciate this treatment, and I was very afraid that the machine was going to snag the ends and cause breakage. If I had shorter hair (hair that I could gently feed a section into the machine) it might work better, but I don&#x27;t... so it didn&#x27;t. Use with caution, my long-haired lovelies. You don&#x27;t want to ruin 6 months worth of growth on this contraption.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after reading all the glowing reviews about this product.  She likes it, but it does seem to be made for people with medium-long, fairly straight hair.  Her hair is almost shoulder length and she doesn&#x27;t quite get the same results as some of the other ladies that have posted their results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is going to continue to grow her hair because she is excited about the potential and is looking for a change.  I guess she wants to look like a mermaid.  I will say she was impressed with the overall look and feel of the quality of the product.  She loved the box it came in and said it would make a great gift.  She liked the fact that it had 3 heat settings, not to be confused with normal 2 settings that aren&#x27;t heat settings at all.  They are usually high and low, both being the same temp, but one blowing harder.  This has the 3 heat settings PLUS 2 speed settings.  This product is very lightweight, which is great because it will take you a bit longer to do your hair in sections as instructed.  If you fit the right profile, I think you will love this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the money as a hair dryer, we didn&#x27;t have the best of luck with the twirly beach waves, though. My hair is waist length, and one of my daughters has thick hair and the other two have very fine hair, it worked best on the daughter with shoulder length thick hair.  To be fair, my hair is a challenge anyway, it&#x27;s incredibly limp. I&#x27;m not used to blow drying, I prefer air drying, and the intake kept sucking my hair into it.  Other than that, I would say it&#x27;s an excellent dryer, I like the variety of options, including the cold air blast button.  Don&#x27;t let the fact that the beach waves didn&#x27;t work on me deter you, perms also fall right out of my hair. I am just destined to have straight hair. Can&#x27;t fight destiny. I still like the dryer.</li>
    <li> I have natural wavy hair, but I wanted more controlled waves. I love this product; however, I found it works best with shoulder-length or shorter hair. When my hair was longer, I had problems getting the entire length wavy with this...the top half would be OK but towards the ends of my hair it was straight and limp. So, I would recommend it only for medium or short hair. I think the type of styling products you use also greatly affects it - make sure your hair is well conditioned, because otherwise you will end up with a tangled mess. Halfway through, you might want to lightly spray the remaining damp hair because if it gets too dry, you won&#x27;t get good results.</li>
    <li> Like others have mentioned, I like the fact that this dryer is not too heavy.  Some leave your wrist aching before you&#x27;re done using them.      As someone with natural curl, it&#x27;s nice being able to choose the wavy option and still eliminate the friz.       One dryer that still allows me to use it for smoothing my hair too.     Great concept.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t have long hair (though I do have very bushy, wavy, George Lucas-type hair when I grow it out), so my mother worked with me to review those aspects of this dryer I could not assess, and she loves it. It&#x27;s easy to honestly say that this dryer not only looks great, but it performs everything it&#x27;s supposed to very well too. However, as an added bonus, it is way lighter than our other hair dryer, even though this one might be a bit bigger. Having arthritis, my mother really likes the lightweight factor. And, yes, the two attachments that come with the dryer, the AirWave and the Concentrator, work well and come with simple to follow instructions. I found them easy enough to attach and remove also. This dryer has two speed settings, 3 heat settings, and a \\&quot;Cool Shot\\&quot; button. There&#x27;s also a removable filter on the back (cleaning instructions are in the Use and Care Guide, it is a simple matter). A very impressive dryer from Remington, and the big package makes it look great if you want to give it as a gift.</li>
    <li> As a mom to 5 girls, I spend a LOT of time doing hair. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for faster, easier ways to do hair. This dryer has earned a permanent spot in my vanity. I have to admit my first use started with a quick read of the directions. It&#x27;s very straight forward, I pressed the attachment on, stuck a clump of my hair in, and watched for the swirl... nothing. My hair just shot straight out. It did take me a moment to realize I had incorrectly attached the attachment. I didn&#x27;t realize it will snap on the end - I thought it worked like an old dryer I had that attachments were just fitted over the end. When I reversed it - my hair started spinning. Now, I have hair about 4-6 inches past my shoulders and it did an OK job giving my hair long, loose waves. The curls weren&#x27;t as full as I was hoping for and the ends stayed pretty straight. The roots lacked body too. It also added a few tangles to my hair.  I tried it on 4 daughters. The 2 and 3 year olds hair is too short, a few wispy waves. The 10 yr old has some natural wave, not thick hair, and just past her shoulders - and this worked well on her. The 9 yr old has thick hair, slightly wavey, and just past her shoulders and this technique knotted her hair awful. Won&#x27;t do it on her again, and that experience has kept me from trying it on my 6 yr old with hair to her bottom.  I will keep using it and experiment a little more.  I like the temperature options, cool button, and high or low settings. One design \\&quot;flaw\\&quot; is the location of the cool button. It is too high up on the handle - a little akward while styling with a brush in the other hand. For me anyway.</li>
    <li> When I selected this product, I had my best friend in mind...since I don&#x27;t have any hair to dry! I gave it to her and told her that I needed her to review the product after she had used it for a while. I completely forgot to follow up and had not even thought to ask her today until it came up today. Come to find out, she has been using it constantly (at least every other day) for the past year and a half. After we started talking about it, she could not stop praising the hair dryer. She kept saying again and again how happy she is with the product. While she does not use the attachments, these were her thoughts on the dryer itself:  Positives:  * The heat is consistent and never gets too hot to burn the hair,  * The fan moves just the right amount of air,  * When the cool button is pressed, it cools down immediately,  * Lightweight, which is nice if you have lots of long hair to dry,  * Has lasted much longer than previous hair dryers  Negatives:  *Bulky  *No folding handle  The positives far outweigh the negatives, which are just minor inconveniences. And at least I know the product is being well loved and used! Based on her opinion, which I value as much as my own, you should not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This product works better on longer hair! (To or passed shoulders.) I&#x27;ve been working with this blow dryer for about a month now trying different ways to do it and i&#x27;m noticing that the more I use it the more I love it!!!! Even my boyfriend has said he loves it when I use this to do my hair! Make sure to let the curls cool down and once they are, turn your head upside down and separate each curl. then toss and to finish use a scrunch spray like herbal essence&#x27;s tousle me softly or aussie&#x27;s scrunch spray. However you do it, just remember DON&#x27;T get discouraged! This product takes practice.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness this works so well! I was concerned because my hair is short(chin length) but it still gave my hair tons of volume and is super pretty. Totally worth the 20 bucks for the dryer, it is also a huge time saver, it is so nice to have my hair dried and styled at the same time!!</li>
    <li> I love this blowdryer! My sister and I coincidentally bought the same one, and we both rave about it! Very easy to use, curls come out as if I had used a curling iron! I have medium length hair, just below my shoulders, and it worked really well! Definitely use when hair is damp and product helps, too. On my first try curls came out great - but practice would definitely perfect them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairdryer for quite a while now and I&#x27;m pretty pleased. I like how it&#x27;s nice and lightweight and easy to travel with. Some hairdryers are not powerful enough to dry my thick hair in a reasonable amount of time but this one has been great. It does take about 5-10 minutes for it to completely cool off after use but that seems normal.     I was however hoping that the attachment would dry my hair with a nice wavy finish but it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as I expected. Nonetheless, this product dries my hair quickly and is a great deal!</li>
    <li> this advertised itself as curling your hair or creating waves while you dry your hair.  all it did was twist my hair in a circle like you would do if you twirled it with your finger.  when the hair dried it had some wave but the ends were straight and dried out looking.  try to think of what your hair ends look like after a bad perm, when the ends are straight because you did not get them wrapped around the curl well enough.  Very sorry I wasted money on it.  I put it to the side as a spare hair dryer.</li>
    <li> My most favorite appliance in the world.</li>
    <li> This product gave me static. I have very fine hair and it wasn&#x27;t great for my hair type but for most other people I think the affect is pretty cool.</li>
    <li> For the most part, there isn&#x27;t anything terribly unique or special about this hair dryer.  As a male with VERY simple hair styling needs, it suits all my purposes without any complaint on my part...but then again, almost any dryer that was actually functioning would!  It&#x27;s noisier than some I&#x27;ve used...but to offset that, it is compact without feeling flimsy.    So I turned to my long-haired, fashion conscious 16-year-old daughter for evaluations of the wave attachments.  She eagerly tried it all out.  Her verdict is a very modest \\&quot;thumbs-up.\\&quot;  The attachments allow you to essentially put portions of your hair through the tubes that attach, and through various contortions and twistings, your hair is to dry with a wave.  This turns out to be very time-consuming, and I&#x27;d say the results are more in line with making the hair \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;wavy.\\&quot;  My daughter liked it okay, but agrees that it really takes FAR too much time to go through the process...absolutely not something she&#x27;d use every day.    My wife likes the dryer fine, but it&#x27;s nothing special to her either.  If you shop around for price, and find this one to be reasonable, than it&#x27;s a safe bet.  But I wouldn&#x27;t pay extra for the attachments unless you&#x27;ve got LOTS of time and LOTS of need to wave your hair.</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair, and have had none of the issues the previous poster had.  This works like magic, and takes the same amount of time as blowdrying my hair with a regular blowdryer.  It&#x27;s so easy to use, it&#x27;s practically foolproof.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this dryer!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m tempted to say that the Remington Airwave does what it was intended to do and leave it at that.  After all, how much can be said of a hair dryer?  If it dries your hair, it&#x27;s fine, at least in my opinion.  But it does deserve a bit more attention than that.  It does come, after all, with attachments which focus the heat on sections of your hair, something I don&#x27;t normally make use of.  However, for the purposes of this review, I did give them a shot, and found them a bit confusing, and difficult to affix to the dryer.  Still, if I had longer hair that needed any sort of serious styling I suspect they might come in handy.  It requires a lot of power, and might well trip a circuit breaker on a loaded line, but most decent dryers do.  There&#x27;s a price for all that heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty, I don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;d ever need much more than this.  It&#x27;s a decent unit and can be easily hung out of the way via a handy hook on the handle.  That clutter-busting feature alone makes it worth your consideration.</li>
    <li> Powerful hair dryer.  The hi/low settings allow for different airflows.  What really surprised me is how cold the cold air button is.  Having had a few hair dryers I&#x27;ve never expected much.  This one really is cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely balanced, feels good in the hand.  Buttons and switches all logically placed and easy to use without reading the manual.</li>
    <li> What a great little hair dryer; I love the multiple heat and blower settings and the long (5 ft+) power cord is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to change my normal hairdryer for a while now, but never bothered to. Old theory was once it works do not spend any more money on another. However, this hairdryer changed my mind, even about new technology. The makeup of this dryer - ceramic ions, is really different. My hair is much softer and shinier, and much more manageable. No need to use frizz lotions anymore.     I did not realize that the problem was with my dryer, therefore I was constantly trying various hair products to get the manageable feel I get when I go to the professionals, but I realize that I am now into one of their secrets - ceramic ions and of course the right products, but I can no longer go back to my other dryer.     This dryer has a switch to cool it down if the heat becomes too much and there are separate settings next to the on switch that can remain static so the next time you use it you do not have to test it every time you use it.    It is not heavy and it is slim enough to be comfortable in your hands. What is also great is it is almost silent.</li>
    <li> I have long, thin, stick-straight hair and I have always envied the beachy wavy hair look that some girls get naturally.  I&#x27;ve tried everything in the last 10 years to get this effect:  sleeping in sponge curlers, three-pronged curling irons, sleeping in braids, etc, etc.  They all either made my hair look crimped, or just didn&#x27;t hold at all.  This dryer is great.  It give me that all over mermaid look without looking unnatural like the crimpers do.  I had read reviews saying this worked for girls with naturally curly hair and wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for straight hair, but I&#x27;m happy to say that it does!  I&#x27;m going to experiment with things like using bigger sections of my hair for bigger waves, and starting out with my hair a bit more damp!</li>
    <li> I love LOVE this hair dryer! It works great. The waves that are promised in the advertising, I was kind of skeptical about, but after trying it, it almost reminds me of those dolls I used to have where you use hot or cold water and their hair \\&quot;magically\\&quot; changes color...you \\&quot;magically\\&quot; get waves! It has great drying time, and I don&#x27;t get frizzies from it either!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It delivers on its promise to create loose beachy waves.  I have very fine straight hair cut in a bob, and it took a few days of practice and experimentation to get the look I wanted.  Make sure sections of fine hair are big enough -- the recommended 1\\&quot; may not be big enough -- and that you&#x27;re getting a solid twist when you remove the strand.  A texturizing product (I used Surf Hair) worked much better than mousse. Drawback -- it took longer to dry my hair than a conventional hair dryer, and it works best if you section the hair first, so there&#x27;s quite a time commitment.  Results are great though, and the price is a bargain.</li>
    <li> Going back to basics: a fun little hair drier that does the job that you can just throw in your travel bags.  Very light, which is what one forgets with all the push with the more professional hair dryers.  Functionalities include hot/cold and two speeds: All you need.  Also included are a nuzzle that provides an intense action and a funkier wave attachment, which works well for non-strong hair types!  Not sure about the ionic aspect, but at least one&#x27;s hair does not get caught in the hairdryer, which happens a lot in the much cheaper cuts.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer has lots of power and settings. There&#x27;s a button (or what I would call trigger) on the handle that you can press to instantly turn the heat off.  Overall this hairdryer simply has a good, sturdy \\&quot;feel\\&quot; to it.  Some I have had in the past are too lightweight and not constructed nearly as well as this one.  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks and have been very happy.</li>
    <li> I think this dryer is great. I bought it specifically for the wave attachment. It gave my fine limp hair spiral waves that lasted all day. This is a great tool for the money.</li>
    <li> This thing is so easy to use, if you have a problem with it, something is wrong with you.  I have below shoulder length hair.  It takes me 10 minutes to do.  I use larger sections than 1\\&quot;.  The waves look so natural that my DAD asked me if I had naturally wavy hair.  WHAT?!?  The wave lasts until you wash your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get body on top of your head, hold the dryer straight up above your head instead of to the side, it will produce great amounts of body!  I just use a light leave in conditioner with no other styling product &amp; it works great.  Just remember to use the cool shot before removing each section of hair.</li>
    <li> It took me a couple of tries to really get my hair to look the way I wanted.  Now that I have had some practice, I love it! It does take about 20-25 minutes to do my hair as opposed to normal drying about 10 minutes.  I enjoy the way my hair looks after using the airwave, so I don&#x27;t mind the extra time 1-2 times a week.  Maybe after I&#x27;ve had it longer, I&#x27;ll figure out some shortcuts!</li>
    <li> I have been needing a new hair dryer and I&#x27;m so glad I was able to pick this one up. I always have an issue with static and I typically let my hair air dry and straighten but often, especially in winter months, I still end up with static hair. This hair dryer really does help with that problem. I don&#x27;t have to sit around and wait for my medium thick hair to air dry and I don&#x27;t have to deal with frizz and static when I dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wave feature really does work though it is a bit time consuming. Having little ones around, it has been difficult for me to get through the entire process without interruption, though what I have managed to accomplish when everyone is asleep is nice, long waves that really make it look like I just got back from the beach. My hair has a bit of natural wave when allowed to air dry but I also get a good bit of \\&quot;poof\\&quot; when I allow it to air dry as well, so I almost always use a straightener after. Though with the wave attachment, I don&#x27;t have to wait for my hair to air dry and I get the waves without the poof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t plan to use the attachment, its a great value for this wonderful hair dryer. It&#x27;s lightweight compared to its size (it can be a bit bulky, especially with the attachment which almost doubles its size) and I love that it has the hanging hook. It feels very durable and appears to be made of high quality materials. It&#x27;s been well worth it&#x27;s purchase price and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer has a powerful cyclone type effect and will take your hair into the airwave and curl it. I have long hair and had no issue getting my hair into the \\&quot;tunnel\\&quot;. Unfortunately however, the curl result was quite limp and looked perhaps like after you braid your hair and then take it out. Perhaps this might work for people with thick hair but for my hair, which is very thin, the cyclone effect was wasted. I ended up removing the attachment which easily comes off and using the hair dryer just as you would any other average hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  When used just as a hair dryer with the concentrator attachment, it dries hair very quickly.  Three temperature levels are great.  The high level gets hot!  The two speed levels are wonderful for drying and styling.  The wave attachment is very simple to use.  Just section off hair, the smaller the section, the tighter the wave.  I suggest using a thermal spray to protect hair from heat and use a spray gel or wave enhancing spray on damp hair and style with the waver.  You will want to blow dry until slightly damp, then use the waver.  This will create the \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; waves you are looking for.  I finish my style off with a shine enhancer.  Looks wonderful!</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time today and I think it was the first time I have ever giggled while drying my hair!  I have waist length highlighted hair with medium coarse texture and some natural wave.  When my hair dries naturally, the wave is uneven and looks icky.  First of all, totally agree that you should dry your hair until it is almost dry before using the wave attachment!  That was a genuis suggestion by others that have posted.  BUT if you have long hair like mine, you can totally not bother with any sectioning.  Just feed a hunk of hair into the attachment, and it will whip itself into exactly what you need.  so so so easy.  the smaller the section, the tighter the wave.  if you feed in irregular amounts i think it looks more natural anyway.  DID NOT HURT OR TUG HAIR ONE BIT!    You should spray the heck out of it with some hairspray when you are done after scrunching in a little shine serum.  use lotion or mousse for styling not serums otherwise there will be no hold.  a volumizing spray would probably work, too.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, straight hair. And this airwave attachment gave me the beachy waves everyone is talking about. I&#x27;m quite impressed. My hair will hold a a spiral curl pretty well with a heat tool (twisting a flat iron works best). But when it comes to getting loose waves like this - nothing usually works. Braiding gives my hair weird kinks. Scrunching while drying - that only works for girls who actually have curl to begin with! I would recommend using a little product before stating.</li>
    <li> I used to have naturally wavy hair that I could just let dry to get these waves.  Unfortunately, as i have gotten older and colored my hair more, leaving my hair to dry is a hassle.  It is very thick and doesn&#x27;t dry for a few hours.  The whole time it is drying I am obsessive about it.  I don&#x27;t let anyone touch it, i constantly have my fingers in it, and somehow it always still turns out bad.  This hair dryer was great.  It cut my drying time in half, and i didn&#x27;t get bored or tired.  all you have to do is stand there with a piece of your hair in it.  It does all the work.  It created great beachy waves for me, and it lifts at the roots for a lot of volume.  I recommend not using too much hair product, or else the waves don&#x27;t separate very well at the end of it all.  Overall, i love it.  It makes my life easier and it boosts my confidence.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought me this blowdryer for christmas because I saw it at Target, but then they discontinued it. So, I ordered it online.   I totally love this hair blow dryer! It creates really nice beachy looking waves. It takes less time than a curling iron and looks more natural too!    The only downsides to this are that it can be a little to loud (but what kind of hair blow dryer is totally quiet?) and that you have to section your hair evenly to get really nice curls, which can take a little time. But overall, i would recommend this product for those trying to get nice wavey hair.</li>
    <li> This works decently. It does give your hair waves, but the ends are a little more straight than what I hoped for. It is fairly easy to use after you try it a couple of times.</li>
    <li> Note: I have long straight thick Asian hair. I do not know how this works on other types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I received a similar Remington model with wave attachment years ago as a Christmas gift and used it for several years. I bought this particular hair dryer and wave attachment because I loved my old one so much and learned that Remington discontinued dryers with the wave attachment. Unfortunately, the attachment cannot fit on other types of hair dryers so I bought this one as a back up just in case my old one dies one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wave attachment will not &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; your hair, so if you are looking for bouncy tight curls use a curling iron! Using the attachment will simply give you loose beachy textured waves...&lt;br /&gt;It simply twists your hair into spirals while drying your hair. It&#x27;s kind of the same concept as when you were little you would braid your hair while it was wet and after it dried and took your hair out of the braids it was textured and wavy.&lt;br /&gt;Section your hair and stick the section of hair through the tube, move the hair dryer up and down the length of the hair section until dry and then move on to the next section. Wait a few minutes after your done until your hair cools down, then lightly run your fingers through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I style my hair with this attachment I get complements.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful trying to remove the attachment from the dryer after you&#x27;re done because the tube may be very hot still from the hot air.</li>
    <li> I should start out by saying that unlike the previous reviewer, I have a bob that is past my chin that I&#x27;m trying to grow out. It&#x27;s getting boring, so I saw this in a magazine and bought it immediately, and it is the BEST investment I&#x27;ve made in a year! No more curling irons, straighteners, expensive product to give me that wave I like so much, I have the Airwave! It&#x27;s super easy to use (even easier than using a round brush and regular hair dryer) and gives gorgeous beachy waves every single time! An 11-year-old could do it, and in fact, I&#x27;m planning on giving this as a gift to several young ladies I&#x27;d know that love that look! This is worth the money, because you&#x27;ll get a lot of use out of it and love your hair!</li>
