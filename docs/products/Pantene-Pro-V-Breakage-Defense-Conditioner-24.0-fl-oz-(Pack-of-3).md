    <li> Great shampoo great price</li>
    <li> I have been using Pantene for many years, and this is the first one I really don&#x27;t care for.  It does not smell bad.  It may or may not strengthen my hair, but I never use it when I am going out of the house.  When I use it it seems to make my hair sort of flat and  a little greasy maybe, so I only use it when I am not going to see anyone.  When I am going anywhere I use Pantene Volume conditioner,  It leaves my hair very shiny and with a lot of body.</li>
    <li> My hair is past my backside, and therefore the ends get a bit shaggy.  This new Pantene really works and everyone has noticed and commented on how more healthy my hair looks.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has long hair.  Also, use the shampoo and you get double results.  One last thing, if you get it on auto-ship you will never run out and you can&#x27;t beat the price per unit that you will pay.</li>
    <li> They had fast and prompt service and is exactly what they described!! Love their product, great quality and will buy again!!</li>
    <li> Smells good but I find alot of pantene drying.</li>
    <li> Good deal fast ship better than store pricing.</li>
    <li> I color my hair and we have extremely hard water- This conditioner is great, doesn&#x27;t fade my color, helps with static in the winter and the extreme hair loss/breakage following my pregnancy.

    <li> Amazing for your hair!! This is the best conditioner I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my hair feel soft and silky</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo, I bought the pack because it minimizes trips to the store and at a sale price I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! Pantene is a top notch brand in my eyes! I love the Pro V anti breakage formula! I have long thick hair but tend to sufffer from split ends. Since using this I have noticed not only is my hair more strong its also super soft and silky!  Pantene has always been my go to Shampoo and Conditioner product as I always feel my best after using it. It leaves my hair looking Amazing!

    <li> To me all conditioners are the same, they moisturize your hair. So when i saw it was anti breakage formula, i thought jack pot! But disappointingly it left my hair dy and brittle. And if your sensitive to strong scents i&#x27;&#x27;d advise you to stay away from this product. i give it 2 stars because it some what defined my curls</li>
