      <li>but I am sure he will love it.</li>
      <li>One of my biggest gripes with scented lotions is that many of them sacrifice moisturizing abilities for scent.</li>

      <li>I receive lots of compliments on it as the guys love it.</li>

      <li>AND I LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS CREAM,</li>
      <li>I had purchased this lotion because a youtube guru that I love recommended it</li>
      <li>Received quick and I love it!</li>
      <li>Received it as a gift and loved it so much that I bought more.  </li>
      <li>We could reapply, but that runs the risk of the scent becoming overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is just as awesome as I remember it and the lotions came fresh and individually wrapped.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer with a terrific scent.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent great mosterizing lotion left my skin nice and soft, not much more to say just great lotion.</li>
      <li>so hey I&#x27;m down for smelling good !</li>
      <li>I really like is that the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet, like vanilla, but with a hint of berry.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>Good quality and lasts for a really long time.</li>
      <li>It feels so good on dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Dark Kiss Triple Moisture Body Cream is an extraordinary cream with extremely pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>moisturizes very well for a scented lotion and good for some of the regular over the counter lotions as well.</li>
      <li>Worth the money</li>
      <li>So fresh and fragrant.  </li>
      <li>I said to myself this can&#x27;t be right.</li>
      <li>The entire line of Dark Kiss is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>BUT I ALSO ENDED UP SPENDING $12.00 ON TOP OF WHAT I PAID INITIALLY  </li>
      <li>thanks so much for helping me have my favorite scent back!</li>
      <li>Great quality body creme, nice and thick, with a long lasting scent.</li>
      <li>I only wear it on special occasions</li>
      <li>I had previously purchased it in store and knew I wanted more.</li>
      <li>THIS BODY CREAM WAS VERY OLD</li>
      <li>Smell stays on you all day and leaves your skin soft.</li>
      <li>BUT I GUESS “the splurge shop” WAS TRYING TO SELL OLD STUFF TO PEOPLE, SO THEY CAN JUST GET RID OF IT.</li>
      <li>I will suggest that if you plan on layering this with other products such as the Dark Kiss body scents, that you use the body scents sparingly as this smells just strong enough to where it&#x27;s really not necessary to apply the body scents until later on when the lotion&#x27;s scent begins to start wearing off.</li>

<li> This does have the typical \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; feel in that you need to be cautious of lotion hands for a few minutes afterwards, but this absorbs fairly quickly into the skin</li>
<li> My skin isn&#x27;t bone dry a few hours later, although I will note that if you have exceptionally dry areas such as elbows you might have to apply the lotion a little more frequently for those trouble areas.</li>
<li> It still creeps me out wondering how long it sat on the shelf</li>
<li> Bought thise for the unbelievable price and my fiance wanted a new scent on me.</li>
<li> It only took two days to receive Dark Kiss.  </li>
<li> Dark Kiss smells so romantic.</li>
<li> I know the smell and this one smells as i expected.</li>
<li> I tend to have to do this with multiple lotions, so if you typically have to use the heavy duty lotions then you need to know that despite its moisturizing capabilities, this isn&#x27;t going to be a heavy duty moisturizer.</li>
<li> I have never used dark kiss lotion sprays or anything before</li>
<li> and if it REALLY is dark kiss..some reviews say it&#x27;s not</li>
<li> I ordered it from here and was slightly disappointed at first and just threw it aside for a couple days.</li>
<li> Although it&#x27;s dull to me</li>
<li> Although the plastic lid was broken, the seller immediately replaced sending overnight (2 days).  </li>
<li> AND IT SMELLED AWFUL.  </li>

    <li> Received quick and I love it!</li>
    <li> THIS BODY CREAM WAS VERY OLD AND IT SMELLED AWFUL.  USUALLY IT IS A VERY POPULAR PRODUCT AND I LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS CREAM, BUT I GUESS “the splurge shop” WAS TRYING TO SELL OLD STUFF TO PEOPLE, SO THEY CAN JUST GET RID OF IT. IT WASN’T ENOUGH THAT I FOUND MYSELF CHEATED, BUT I ALSO ENDED UP SPENDING $12.00 ON TOP OF WHAT I PAID INITIALLY  TO SEND IT BACK.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT A SHAME!</li>
    <li> Great quality body creme, nice and thick, with a long lasting scent. The smell is heavenly. It&#x27;s sweet, like vanilla, but with a hint of berry. If you like Brittany Spears perfume Midnight Fantasy, it&#x27;s similar.</li>
    <li> Dark Kiss Triple Moisture Body Cream is an extraordinary cream with extremely pleasant fragrance. After you use it the skin is smooth and it smells great.Worth the money and I will be sure to have it from now on :)</li>
    <li> She loved it the fragrance is very appealing too</li>
    <li> Love it! Smell stays on you all day and leaves your skin soft. Non greasy. I always get asked what im wearing. Great aroma.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion. For daughter after one of my co worker&#x27;s had this on.  This fragrance has been discontinued from bath and body works</li>
    <li> A wonderful product.  It feels so good on dry skin.  It only took two days to receive Dark Kiss.  Dark Kiss smells so romantic.</li>
    <li> I know the smell and this one smells as i expected. Good quality and lasts for a really long time.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased it in store and knew I wanted more. I receive lots of compliments on it as the guys love it.</li>
    <li> I have never used dark kiss lotion sprays or anything before so I did not know what to expect. I must admit when I received the lotion it looked..old. I opened it and the scent wasn&#x27;t very strong I said to myself this can&#x27;t be right. I had purchased this lotion because a youtube guru that I love recommended it and I went to bath and body works and it had been discontinued. I ordered it from here and was slightly disappointed at first and just threw it aside for a couple days. One day I decided to just put it on and I was getting complimented on my fragance..I was amazed. Although it&#x27;s dull to me and I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell people seem to love it so hey I&#x27;m down for smelling good ! It still creeps me out wondering how long it sat on the shelf and if it REALLY is dark kiss..some reviews say it&#x27;s not and I believe that. So be cautious.</li>
    <li> Felt like I had just ordered the lotions and they&#x27;re already here! The smell is just as awesome as I remember it and the lotions came fresh and individually wrapped. Would definitely buy from here again!</li>
    <li> this lotion is VERY VERY Strongly scented.. there is no way i could use it as a lotion or the smell would be to over powering.&lt;br /&gt;fortunately I&#x27;ve had this lotion before and knew that. I ordered it specifically to use as a perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it every day!</li>
    <li> Received it as a gift and loved it so much that I bought more.  Great moisturizer with a terrific scent.</li>
    <li> Great, all of my Ladies love it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazingly gorgeous!</li>
    <li> a gift for my grand daughter who is away from home.  Although the plastic lid was broken, the seller immediately replaced sending overnight (2 days).  No complaints and she loved the gift.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent great mosterizing lotion left my skin nice and soft, not much more to say just great lotion.</li>
    <li> Bought thise for the unbelievable price and my fiance wanted a new scent on me. He has yet to be indulged by it but I am sure he will love it.</li>
    <li> The entire line of Dark Kiss is wonderful.  This lovely body cream is no exception--and at a really great price!</li>
    <li> Man will I ever stop loving this scent??? not even this lotion is just as luscious as can be smells great and is sooo creamy....I only wear it on special occasions thanks so much for helping me have my favorite scent back!</li>
    <li> Best smelling cream in the world!  So fresh and fragrant.  Hope they never stop making it!  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Smells kinda like cotton candy. Got it as a gift and they loved it. I guess it hasn&#x27;t been in stores for 2 years or so.</li>
    <li> wonderful body lotion.</li>
    <li> smells good not on me thoe</li>
    <li> One of my biggest gripes with scented lotions is that many of them sacrifice moisturizing abilities for scent. This means that some of us with drier skin have to apply two different lotions or forego the scented lotion altogether. We could reapply, but that runs the risk of the scent becoming overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizes very well for a scented lotion and good for some of the regular over the counter lotions as well. My skin isn&#x27;t bone dry a few hours later, although I will note that if you have exceptionally dry areas such as elbows you might have to apply the lotion a little more frequently for those trouble areas. I tend to have to do this with multiple lotions, so if you typically have to use the heavy duty lotions then you need to know that despite its moisturizing capabilities, this isn&#x27;t going to be a heavy duty moisturizer. This does have the typical \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; feel in that you need to be cautious of lotion hands for a few minutes afterwards, but this absorbs fairly quickly into the skin so it&#x27;s not going to be mega-oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like is that the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming. You can tell it&#x27;s there, but it&#x27;s a softer scent that won&#x27;t overpower everyone. I will suggest that if you plan on layering this with other products such as the Dark Kiss body scents, that you use the body scents sparingly as this smells just strong enough to where it&#x27;s really not necessary to apply the body scents until later on when the lotion&#x27;s scent begins to start wearing off.</li>
