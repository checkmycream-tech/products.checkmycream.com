      <li>I have sensitive skin that dries very easily with most cleansing products.  </li>
      <li>It sounds counter-intuitive, but this rich, non-foaming, gentle cleanser took my irritated, greasy skin and made it soft and smooth and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>Light clean smell.  </li>
      <li>I used a popular dept store brand since high school</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products by Dr. Hauschka, and definitely the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is a creamy cleanser, and not soap based, so don&#x27;t expect it to suds up.  You only need to use one pump each time you cleanse, so the product actually lasts quite a long time.  It is very gentle, and makes your skin feel very soft.  It also removes makeup nicely.  I have been using it consistantly for about a year, and I love the way my sensitive skin does not react to it in any negative way, but rather feels soothed and healthy.  The cleanser feels very luxurious and nurturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is a good cleanser for removing make-up..the only thing about it is that it does not remove mascara. However it does leave your face moist and soft!</li>
    <li> Have used the products for a long time ands like them. The only issue with this particular bottle was a flaw in the pump portion of the bottle. It was stuck together and broke when I tried to get it apart. I had to transfer the cleanser to a different container.</li>
    <li> This is my second or third time ordering.  I am about to turn (gulp) 40 and try to use very little on my face.  This cleanser is gentle and I always get compliments on my skin and how young I look.  :)</li>
    <li> Dr. Hauschka Soothing Cleansing Milk is one of my favorite facial cleansers.  It&#x27;s extremely gentle and really hydrating.  The consistency is very creamy and kind of melts on my skin as I&#x27;m washing.  And it smells so good!  It&#x27;s a must-have in my rotation of facial washes.  My face is a little on the oily side, so sometimes I&#x27;ll use a deep cleaning cleanser first and follow up with the Soothing Cleansing Milk.  Apparently it can also be used as a make-up remover (I&#x27;ve only used it as a facial cleanser).  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, so you can be sure I will scrape out every last drop I can before ordering more.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for a few years, always satisfied with it.  H has sensitive skin and this line of products is great - you just can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I have typically had fairly average skin: fair, a little oily in the T zone, occasional break-outs, and slight sensitivity.  All of a sudden last fall my skin began to FREAK. OUT.  My best guess is that it was due to extended air travel back and forth across the country coupled with some minor stress.  My normally placid skin got itchy, flaky dry patches.  It was red and inflamed in places.  I went to my old stand-bys at the department store to try some heavy duty moisturizers but they did nothing--they either felt like they didn&#x27;t absorb, or stung when I applied them.  I finally emailed my sister, who has battled super sensitive skin her entire life--that is, until she discovered Dr. Hauschka.  Figuring I had nothing to lose, I got some Cleansing Milk and a couple of different moisturizers (the Moisturizing Mask and the Rose Day Cream) and had at it.  That very first night when I rubbed the Cleansing Milk onto my face I actually sighed.  It felt AMAZING.  Smooth, comforting, and moisturizing without being heavy or greasy, it was wonderful.  My skin issues cleared up in less than a week.  I have been using the cleansing milk ever since, and honestly can&#x27;t imagine going back.  Notes:  -Despite what it says, it does NOT remove make-up.  Not eye make-up, at least.  You&#x27;ll need a separate make-up remover for that.  No biggie, in my book.  (Someone once said to me, \\&quot;If a cleanser removes all that make-up, imagine what it does to your skin.\\&quot;)  -The price tag is a bit hefty, but one 4.9 oz bottle has lasted me a little over two months, with two pumps per use and using twice a day. For me, it&#x27;s an indulgence well worth the cost.  -I like to rub this on with my fingers and remove it with a warm, wet wash cloth for some extra exfoliation.  Bliss.  -For those coming from traditional foaming cleansers or drug store varieties, the texture might take some getting used to.  I had been using Neutrogena and Purpose, so this was definitely a change.  A glorious, glorious change.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!  It&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin(freckles-easy redness). I originally bought this at Whole Foods because an older man who worked there saw me and said it would help with the redness in my face. So I bought it thinking hmmmm wonder if it will work. Well it&#x27;s been 5 months and the redness is gone. I am just now needing my second bottle. It truly has been great for my skin. I also use rose water as a toner which helps with redness also.</li>
    <li> absolutely the BEST product line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this product, but I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the other Dr. Hauschka products (toner and day cream) that I thought I&#x27;d give it a try - and I&#x27;m glad I did. I was never one to spend a lot of money on bath and body products, but I am starting to understand why people do! This cleansing milk leaves my skin so amazingly soft, and I swear I can see a difference even just after a week of using it in conjunction with the toner and oil. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about the Dr. Hauschka Sensitive Skin products. I have tried SOOOOO many different products in the past couple of years, so was excited to read such great reviews on these sensitive skin products. I purchased the cleansing milk, toner and rose day cream. After 2 days my face felt like it was on fire and since has been extrememly flakey all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had problems finding a good facial treatment since cutting out parabans, sulfates, etc from my products. I found out the reason... just bc it&#x27;s organic or \\&quot;natural\\&quot; does not mean you can&#x27;t be allergic or sensitive to it. Apparently you can develop just as bad reactions to them (maybe even more likely) than others unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tons of seasonal allergies, so makes sense that I&#x27;m allergic to ingredients in the natural products with herbs, tree extracts, etc. This cleanser also has alcohol! I have no idea how alcohol is acceptable in a sensitive skin care line. Dermatologists will tell you to stay away from alcohol, especially if you have sensitive skin. Disappointed in this line.</li>
    <li> I am super disappointed in this product. All the reviews talked about how it would take my makeup off but no such luck. I had to use astringent to get the rest of my makeup off. I also felt like there was a film on my face after using this product.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d discovered this in my teens!  It sounds counter-intuitive, but this rich, non-foaming, gentle cleanser took my irritated, greasy skin and made it soft and smooth and beautiful.  Within months of using this product, I started getting compliments -- lots of compliments.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup.  I don&#x27;t exfoliate.  I don&#x27;t get facials or do anything fancy.  The cleansing milk just makes my skin beautiful, and people notice.       It is such a pleasure to use, too, with the soft, floral fragrance.  I use it sparingly, once a day, and a bottle lasts me about six months. I know it&#x27;s appropriate for both oily and sensitive skin (as I have both) and I can tell by the feel of it that it would be very soothing on dry skin.  It doesn&#x27;t even hurt if you get it in your eyes.  It&#x27;s that gentle.    The one drawback of this luxury product is its luxury price.  When things got tight around my household a while back, I stopped buying it and switched to cetaphil gentle cleanser -- a perfectly adequate budget substitute for those pinching pennies, but not as high a performer as Dr. H&#x27;s cleansing milk!     So don&#x27;t go into debt to buy this product, but if you can afford a little decadence, then I highly, highly recommend this cleansing milk.  It&#x27;s truly a cut above the rest.  The best skincare product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I wear a very light powder, which I apply only once in the morning (bare-minerals).&lt;br /&gt;This does not even remove the tiny amount of make-up that I must still have on in the evenings (I checked using witch hazel).&lt;br /&gt;The spout has also gone mouldy from being in the shower and there&#x27;s still about 20% left in the bottle that pump can&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this as a facial cleanser. It&#x27;s gentle, moisturizing, and smells lovely.</li>
    <li> A very gentle face cleanser. It works quite well for combination skin and doesn&#x27;t strip the oil entirely. I have been using it in the summer and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for winter also.</li>
    <li> Works well to take off eye make-up and does not have harmful ingredients. I am on my 4th bottle of it. Easy to use</li>
    <li> Have used this facial cleanser for years &amp; will continue.  Light clean smell.  Takes off any foundation &amp; leaves face soft &amp; clean.  I always use a clean face cloth to remove rather than trying to rinse off.</li>
    <li> Nice feel to my face, but I still use makeup remover.  Alone it won&#x27;t get the mascara off.  I don&#x27;t wear other make up, so I am not sure how well it works on other kinds.  I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price, but if you have extra money, buy it.  I also use the cleansing cream before it or sometimes after if I feel like it.  I do like them together.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a local Whole Food store, quite satisfied with it so I think I gotta share my experience. I wouldn&#x27;t rely on this to remove make-up (I don&#x27;t wear make-up but I wear water-proof sunscreen, and this thing doesn&#x27;t remove it). What I do is that I use this cleanser only once a day. After using DHC Deep Cleansing Oil to remove my sunscreen, I use this cleansing milk as a follow-up, to make sure I remove any traces left of the cleansing oil. Unlike other cleanser products (either natural or non-natural) which dry my skin to no end if I don&#x27;t \\&quot;immediately\\&quot; apply some kind of oil or moisturiser right after cleaning my face, this product doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all. I am pleasantly surprised, since this cleanser contains a large percentage of alcohol which is well-known for drying your skin. Now I can clean my skin, wait 20 minutes for my skin to restore its pH balance and then apply my Vitamin C serum, without having to worry about how painfully dry my skin is during that 20-minute interval!&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars? It&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t remove make-up (or sunscreen in my case), which forces me to have to use another product to remove my sunscreen. I wish there is a product out there that doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, doesn&#x27;t contain harsh ingredient such as sulfate, contains no paraben or phenoxyethanol, only contain a small, safe amount of preservatives, and can can still gently remove oil residue (from skin care products) and water-proof sunscreen from my face, but I have not yet to find one, after spending 4 years searching.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing milk it suits my skin removes any make when I wear make up and leaves my skin ready for the toner and moisturizer.  It&#x27;s creamy and lush without being gooey or sticky it goes on easy removes away the dirt and grime and leaves your face prepped for toning and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> makes the face red, possibly the alcohol base.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing milk.  Not only does it have no toxic substances in it, it is a fantastic eye makeup remover/face wash.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
    <li> Very soothing, but be aware - this product will not remove your makeup! I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing again... I can&#x27;t seem to justify the price since this product doesn&#x27;t remove makeup or really cleanse the skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is really sensitive and I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of cleansing crèmes.  It&#x27;s special formulation (beyond organic) is excellent and made with the finest of ingredients.  It also lasts a very long time so one large container will last me for about 6 months or more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It was recommended to me to treat my once acne-prone skin which seemed counter intuitive at the time as my skin was super dry and broken out and this is a very emollient product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleansing Milk is a gentle, natural cleanser that leaves my skin feeling moist and protected. I use it twice a day - I use it with my Clarisonic brush in the morning and I use it to remove my make up and as a general cleanser at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to move away from it (mostly because of the price), but I always come back to it because it is such a great product!</li>
    <li> I use this on dry skin to emulsify my makeup.  I rinse off with water.  Then I cleanse with another foaming cleanser  after. It is great for taking off makeup.  But I found that I go through a bottle too quickly so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in my budget to keep using this.  Also, it is really difficult to get the last bit once you start to get to the last 1/4 of product left.  I had to flip the bottle over and then scoop it out with a little wooden stick (a coffee stirrer from Starbucks actually).</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 3 years, and I simply can not do without it.  Price is a little high, so I use it sparingly (2 times a day) and it will last me quite awhile.  Tones down the redness that I can get on my face, and makes it feel much smoother.  I feel it is very gentle on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping:)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser!!!! Hands down I converted to hauschka products after using this. Just know that a washcloth needs to be used to remove otherwise a residue may linger. so worth it though! (I have sensitive, combination skin)</li>
    <li> This dehydrated my face. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Dr. Hauschka Soothing Cleansing Milk by my mom who was looking for a cleanser without all the harsh chemicals you see in so many. I LOVE this stuff! In fact I left it in the shower and when my husband took a shower he washed his face with it too. He came out and started going on about how soft his face felt. He couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be switching back to any other cleanser honestly. This stuff beats them all. My favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest using it with some type of light scrubber or brush...to get the dead skin off your face seeing as how fingers don&#x27;t really do much when it comes to that.</li>
    <li> I am buying it again! This is a great product!I clean my face with this milk. I first spray a little bit of water on my face then I lightly rub my face with about 1 tea spoon of this milk then I use a tissue to remove it. This milk smell delicious and clean well !. This is German made, completely natural in a glass bottle to keep it fresh (it doesn&#x27;t have preservative). I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a decade!  Zykes!  It is so gentle on my delicate skin.  I use it just once a day and I never get a break out. If I use it twice, I get a break out, but that&#x27;s with every product!  So, I use it once along with Rose Day Cream and my skin is HAPPY.  Seriously, I feel like my skin cells sing when I put this on my face.  Very good vibes on my skin!</li>
    <li> This is great for dry skin.  It does not leave your skin taut, but as a makeup remover, it is a bit lacking.  I found leftover eye shadow and foundation after I washed with this.  Best to remove the makeup with a stronger makeup remover, and then follow with this for more moisture.  I like that it is organic.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Hauschka skin care products and as well the cosmetic products. This cleaner is the best and i highly recommend it for all skin types.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude.  I really like this stuff.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Dr. Hauschka products to begin with, but I have to admit this stuff is dope.  Knock a star because Dr. Hauschka is stupid expensive across the board.</li>
    <li> Excellent to remove my eye concealor which is why i bought this cream.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that results in peri-oral dermatitis generally with any cleanser I use. I love Hauschka&#x27;s philosophy and the lack of synthetic chemicals in their products. This cleanses my skin without making it irritated, red and bumpy. I am very happy to have found an organic, healthy skin care line that allows me to wash my face without fear!</li>
    <li> Great product!!!!!  I have had trouble with my skin for the longest time until I realized I was OVER doing it with my sensitive skin.  After using this product and using a moisturizer regularly, my skin has cleared up, looks healthier and more luminous.  I particularly like this in the mornings, though it isn&#x27;t bad in taking off makeup too - just need a wash cloth or cotton pad as well.  If you have sensitive problem skin, this is definitely worth a shot.  I&#x27;ve already purchased another for when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> I bumped into a Hauschka saleswoman stocking her shelves at a Whole Foods and she explained how to care for my skin with the product line. So I ordered the Cleansing Milk, Cleansing Cream, Facial Toner, Normalizing Day Oil, Daily Moisturizing Cream and the Lavender Oil from Amazon since it was a better deal than at WF. As she instructed, I filled a basin with really warm water and added the Lavender Bath Essence to it, then soaked a facecloth in it and held that to my face for a bit.  Then cleaned with the cream in the morning, the milk at night.  At night, per her instructions, I only applied the Facial Toner and patted that in. In the morning, I applied the toner, then squirted a bit of Moisturizing Cream into palm and mixed that with 2 drops of the Normalizing Oil.  Within a week, people were complimenting me on my skin. I could see that it looked brighter, healthier, younger. But after reading on the Haushka website that mature skin like mine (I&#x27;m 59) should be treated with the Regenerating Serum and Cream, I plunked down the big bucks for those items.  My skin immediately went back to looking dull and older.  The serum leaves the skin feeling sticky; the cream reeks of mocha and doesn&#x27;t seem to add any moisture.  As soon as I use them up, I&#x27;m going back to the other products.  And my daughter, who is 25 and battling some acne, is now using the other products, too.  Her skin is improving daily, hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy and clear in several years.</li>
    <li> A very satisfactory product particularly in the dry climate of Denver area.  I use it as a part of my daily facial cleansing routine.</li>
    <li> Everytime I put a few drops of this cleansing milk on my skin it feels like if my face is covered with flowers!. This product is so gentle and smells so nice! And because it&#x27;s very fluid you don&#x27;t need to use lot of it. Dr.Hauschka product are one the most natural products I have found on the market. It is German quality and you can feel it. It&#x27;s not the cheapest product but your skin will thank you for giving it so much goodness!</li>
    <li> I love cleansing my face with this Dr. hauschka cleanser. I have been using it for a month now with the clarifying toner and normalizing day oil. It does feel a little oily while washing your face, but it does not make your face oily. The homeopathic principle of oil for oil really does work. However, I did find that it does not completely remove my makeup (mineral powder foundation, finishing powder, and bronzer) on the first wash, I usually have to wash my face twice at night, once to remove the makeup and then again to get the rest. This, however, does not outweigh the positive things about it (it will still last several months). I started using the translucent bronzer about a week ago and have since stopped using face makeup everyday, most days I just put that on top of my moisturizing day oil, and this washes my face of that on the first wash. It has a pleasant smell and refreshes my face. The Dr. Haushcka system has completely changed my skin for the better in just a month. My face looks healthy and feels wonderful! The only negative is that this product was eligible for subscribe and save so you could save money and have it come automatically, now the option is no longer there....please bring it back, amazon!</li>
    <li> This does not remove makeup or eye makeup for me. I use it as a gentle cleaner in A.M. and love it. It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of oils. It&#x27;s a delicate cleanser that soothes my skin after using retinol the night before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  When I&#x27;ve tried something else, it&#x27;s never been good enough so I always go back to it.  My skin likes it, I love their products.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> Very soothing to the skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, easily irritated skin. I like that this cleanser is milky and feels nourishing and light. I have to remain mindful of my rosacea and I find that this cleanser does not contribute to any irritation or flare ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell, texture and I even find the product bottle helpful and convenient. I like a lot of Dr Hauscka&#x27;s products, but this is one that I return to time and time again.</li>
    <li> This has been an excellent product for me for approximately 5 years.  I periodically try other products, but always seem to go back to this cleansing milk.  It goes on in such a smooth way and does not affect my eyes.  I have very sensitive skin and there has never been a negative reaction for me.&lt;br /&gt;My feeling is that it is an extremely pure product that can be worked deeply into the skin with very positive results.</li>
    <li> This product feels amazing. As with all if Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products, most who are not satisfied are not following directions properly. He has a certain application technique which feel uncomfortable ta first, but you adapt. Now that I have formed new habits, I love using his products. Both myself and those around me see a skin difference. FYI there are Youtube videos showing how to apply which helped me.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for my skin. I read a lot of great reviews but it did nothing to help. I tried it for 4 months with no luck. I know everyone is different so this may work for you.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and effective cleanser.  I have been using this product for years.  Wonderful organic scent as well.  ALL of Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products are spot-on.</li>
    <li> All Dr Hauschka&#x27;s products are superior....but pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Save up for them if you want to buy them on a regular basis</li>
    <li> The tube is broken and the cleaning milk leaked everywhere when I received the package.Be sure to make the package strong enough.</li>
    <li> I tried using this product and it just didnt meet any of my expectations. I didnt see any negative or positive improvement.</li>
    <li> Dr. Hauschka Cleansing Milk is a terrific product. It washes my face clean, including eyes, without drying my skin. Good daily face cleaner.</li>
    <li> I am new to these products and they are wonderful. It is amazing when you stop using the harsh products. My skin feels great.</li>
    <li> BEWARE!! This product is super sketchy. The package came in today. I found it unusual that the box wasn&#x27;t sealed and instantly noticed that the Hauschka product box had been, not only opened, but ripped! Ripped and jagged. Now- one may say that I am overreacting and that PERHAPS the soothing cleansing milk itself hasn&#x27;t been compromised. Nonetheless, there is no way in hell that i&#x27;m taking that risk. I&#x27;ve purchased this product solely because i&#x27;m looking to improve the s***ty condition my face has become, I succumbed and scrapped up any money my broke college self could come up with and lo and behold, a potentially used/fake product. The one star I gave is to the jerk-face that sold me a used/damaged product that will (hopefully) be returned.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that dries very easily with most cleansing products.  I love the quality of this and how it makes my skin look and feel.  Very highly recommended for dry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t great for someone who&#x27;s washing off heavy makeup but for me it&#x27;s perfect. After massaging this into your face and rinsing, it leaves your skin soft and the best part is you&#x27;re glowing like you&#x27;re nine months pregnant. My favorite time to use it is in the morning when I&#x27;m not washing off makeup. I barely have to moisturize and put on powder because my face already has this glow that actually makes it look a little tan, which I&#x27;m guessing from all the oils. By the time I get into work and sit at my desk I&#x27;ve already gotten compliments on my skin. It&#x27;s worth the money and the time to make this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr Hauschka for almost a year now. The difference in my skin is definetly noticeable. My husband has even confirmed the difference. More even color and smaller pores, less blemishes, when they do occur (not often anymore at all). I used a popular dept store brand since high school and when I looked up the ingredients, I was really disappointed and stopped using the products as quickly as I could afford to switch. I now use all Dr H, including make up. This lotion has a unique, real smell, is light and refreshing and goes on smooth and completely with one pump, sometimes two when covering my neck and eyes. The larger bottle lasts months and being able to find different sellers on amazon allows for finding a great price. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, if a little pricey. It really improved the look and texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> Has worked better for balancing my facial oils and reducing breakouts. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I love this prodcut line. Great creamy cleanser, I alternate this product with the cleansing cream at night. My skin tends to be dry and this line helps with moisturinzing. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by wife before deciding to buy this myself. I&#x27;m glad I bought. It&#x27;s different than anything I ever tried on my face. I&#x27;ve had oily skin all my life and problems with acne and this cleansing milk takes care of both. It took awhile to get used to because it doesn&#x27;t lather, smells ok (not soap like with other cleansers), and doesn&#x27;t leave your face tingly (not even sure that&#x27;s a word)...anyway, I like it. It is expensive though but I believe its worth the cost in the end.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love the cleansing milk and it takes off makeup.  Love the feel after washing and i don&#x27;t need a moisturizer at bedtime.</li>
    <li> How did this product get such high ratings? I am currently using Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s revitalizing eye cream and I like this product so I decided to purchase this cleanser which most people described as gentle and good for dry skin. The product arrived out of the box with the pump broken.  I tried it anyway by screwing the top off and putting a small amount in my hand. As soon as the cleanser touched my face it started burning. Not &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; but out right burning. I splashed water on my face immediately to remove the product. My face was red and extremely dry. I thought maybe I was allergic until I took a look at the ingredients. Alcohol is the second ingredient. Well, no wonder!! Alcohol will peal the paint off the wall. Why the f**k would you put that in a face cleanser for dry skin? Last time I will be trusting and not read ingredients. Stupid me.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this cleansing milk after reading a lot of good reviews, but I am really disappointed.  The product did not get my skin clean at all.  It just smeared my mascara around my eyes, and when I went to dry my face, I wiped off foundation with the towel.  I was shocked at how poorly this product tackled makeup considering that it says on the box it is also a makeup remover.  After washing with it 2x in a row, I was still toweling makeup off on my towel.  I had to switch back to my old cleanser to actually get my face clean.</li>
    <li> I do enjoy this product so much that I have it on auto-order. I like the way my skin feels after I cleanse with it. I pair this product with another face cleanser by the same company, Dr. Hauschka.</li>
