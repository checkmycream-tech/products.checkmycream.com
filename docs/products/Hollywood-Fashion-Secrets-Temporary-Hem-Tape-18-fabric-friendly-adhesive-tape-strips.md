      <li>These did the trick of hemming the pants perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this, I gave it to a bridesmaid at my wedding</li>
      <li>This stuff is great!  </li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>This stuff is great!  </li>
      <li>(I wear infrequently) and it&#x27;s held up great!</li>
      <li>Awesome product used this tape for my toddler&#x27;s holloween costume pants and it worked great</li>
      <li>Great concept-not so great in results.</li>
      <li>This is The most AWESOME product!!!</li>
      <li>This tape is perfect for a quick hem when you don&#x27;t have time (or don&#x27;t sew period) to get out the thread and needle.  </li>
      <li>so each packet doesn&#x27;t give you very many wearings as you have to remove before each wash.  </li>
      <li>Just amazing.</li>
      <li>This product is especially useful for altering the length of your favorite jeans so that the length can be adjusted according to the shoes worn with them--flats or heels.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more excited that they carry ALL the items in this brand!!</li>
      <li>Does just what it says worked fine until I washed it by mistake!</li>
      <li>Tape is extremely easy to use and holds up nicely.  </li>
      <li>OK, I tried these.</li>
      <li>To be safe just pay to get your pants hemmed.</li>
      <li>Bought for pageant to make sure there are no wardrobe malfuctions.  </li>
      <li>LOVE the Hem Tape as well, and the Sweater Brush to wipe away piling</li>
      <li>I found the tape lasted through about 2 wash/dry cycles (meaning I was able to refold the hem</li>
      <li>Also wish there were more than 18 tapes in a package.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have time to get my pants altered for an event, and this did the trick and held on for a couple of more wearings until I took them off myself.</li>
      <li>prolly need more in a week or so</li>
      <li>When I got home the tape came right off and no sticky residue, which was good.</li>
      <li>My first problem with this tape was applying it to my pants hem and one of the reasons was because it was really sticky and too flimsy to get the tape onto the pants perfectly.</li>
      <li>It seems to come off easily.</li>
      <li>Great since I&#x27;m petite and pants are always a tad bit long</li>
      <li>I originally bought this because I wanted to hem up my scrub pants.</li>
      <li>Took out tape to clean per instructions and there was no evidence of my use of the tape.  </li>
      <li>After following the directions perfectly, they barely lasted about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>This product is such a good idea--I wish I had thought of it myself.</li>
      <li>I bought this hem tape for a quick solution to fix my dress pants for a school event.</li>
      <li>Very first pair of pants, Ann Taylor slacks, and it wont even stick.</li>
      <li>good on light materials, do not recommend for heavy fabrics</li>
      <li>then I replaced it with fresh tape.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it, can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner.</li>
      <li>The pants wouldn&#x27;t be worth having tailored, and this worked well as a solution.</li>
      <li>Quick and easy fix - stronger than double sided tape and better than staples or glue for someone like me who can&#x27;t sew and doesn&#x27;t have the time or doesn&#x27;t want to pay to have someone do it professionally.</li>
      <li>it works but is very very expensive&lt;br /&gt;too</li>
      <li>This tape is great, although I pretty much use it like an extra wide version of the fashion tape that is also available</li>
      <li>I used around 8 to 10 pieces to make sure the entire hem was taped up.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works &amp; will even stay on through a couple of washings!</li>
      <li>The way most blouses are made these days you either wear a camisole or let it open up.</li>
      <li>So, you&#x27;ll be spending more money using this tape then actually getting them hemmed from a tailor.</li>
      <li>Was a perfect solution to a quick fix on a prom dress that was owned by someone else and was very difficult fabric.  </li>
      <li>This is good if you only occasionally need a temporary hem, but less effective if you need an every day solution.  </li>
      <li>The material was light enough I could have used regular tape for a better stick.</li>
      <li>However, with jeans, I did need to pretty much line the hem with the tape to get it to stay up</li>
      <li>Sooo thin but sooo strong!!!</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this before and it works really well.  </li>
      <li>Really help getting all my pants to the correct lenghth when I where heels ....</li>
      <li>The tape worked very well</li>
      <li>These really do the job.  </li>
      <li>NOT wash your clothes with this tape on them, which is kind of a pain, but I&#x27;m not sure they make something that can hold up through washings.</li>
      <li>I did spend 3 hours dancing away in the dress, so maybe this was made more for pants or less movement of the body.</li>
      <li>I wanted a heavy silk scarf to stay flipped across my shoulder all of my 9 hr work day and by the end of that shift, I had to PEEL it Off, because the tape was still so secure!</li>
      <li>I used this to make temporary drapes out of a sheet for our new home until we can decide just what we want there permanently.</li>
      <li>It is EXTREMELY sticky and strong enough to hold up a large hem on jeans.  </li>
      <li>Its also good for hems that sometimes you want shorter (for flat shoes) and other times longer (if you want to wear heels) as you can just remove the tape and bring the hem back down.  </li>
      <li>The tapes are strong enough to hold the hem of heavy denim until removed.  </li>
      <li>Once I got the sticky adhesive part of it onto my pants hem it ended up not being long enough to stick to the whole pants hem.</li>
      <li>If you want to use this to hem pants, be prepared to use a lot, otherwise you get sagging areas...might be useful for other purposes like keeping a shirt closed, etc.</li>

<li> The hem unfolded in less than 8 hours</li>
<li> DIFFICULT TO USE IF YOU NEVER HEMMED PANTS BEFORE, Instructions were not clear enough.</li>
<li> What a mess!</li>
<li> I was very embarrassed and disappointed in this product.</li>
<li> You need at least 4 strips of tape for each pair of pants (</li>
<li> at least 2 on each leg)</li>
<li> If the temporary hem tapes were less expensive, this would not be a concern.  </li>

    <li> These really do the job.  I didn&#x27;t have time to get my pants altered for an event, and this did the trick and held on for a couple of more wearings until I took them off myself.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this tape.  It works very well.</li>
    <li> Every women should have this.  Not only does it hem pants temporarily but in an emergency, it can replace a lost shirt button or a gaping blouse.</li>
    <li> Really help getting all my pants to the correct lenghth when I where heels ....prolly need more in a week or so</li>
    <li> Used this on a pair of suit pants and it did not hold. The material was light enough I could have used regular tape for a better stick.</li>
    <li> Very first pair of pants, Ann Taylor slacks, and it wont even stick. Maybe they work on something else.</li>
    <li> Bought for pageant to make sure there are no wardrobe malfuctions.  Worked well</li>
    <li> I used this on a pair of pants with the hem coming undone at the bottom of the leg. The pants wouldn&#x27;t be worth having tailored, and this worked well as a solution.</li>
    <li> I am short, under 5&#x27;4&amp;#34;, &amp; it seems that pants always have to be hemmed.  This stuff really works &amp; will even stay on through a couple of washings!</li>
    <li> This tape is perfect for a quick hem when you don&#x27;t have time (or don&#x27;t sew period) to get out the thread and needle.  Its also good for hems that sometimes you want shorter (for flat shoes) and other times longer (if you want to wear heels) as you can just remove the tape and bring the hem back down.  I found the tape lasted through about 2 wash/dry cycles (meaning I was able to refold the hem and it still stuck) then I replaced it with fresh tape.</li>
    <li> It seems to come off easily.</li>
    <li> DIFFICULT TO USE IF YOU NEVER HEMMED PANTS BEFORE, Instructions were not clear enough. I originally bought this because I wanted to hem up my scrub pants. I initially thought that this tape would save me convenience and time. However, this hem tape did not give me any convenience just the opposite. My first problem with this tape was applying it to my pants hem and one of the reasons was because it was really sticky and too flimsy to get the tape onto the pants perfectly. Once I got the sticky adhesive part of it onto my pants hem it ended up not being long enough to stick to the whole pants hem. Then after I got the tape onto my pants hem, I walked around for a couple hours and the adhesive would wear and then it would unfold the pants hem. The hem unfolded in less than 8 hours and I was even sitting for some of the time. Thus, I will not be purchasing these again, they were expensive and you could easily pay $10 to get your pants hemmed permanently. I had to use two strips per pant leg and you&#x27;re suppose to take off the tape before you wash it. Which means you cannot re-use the tape because the adhesive wears. So, you&#x27;ll be spending more money using this tape then actually getting them hemmed from a tailor.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Used it to keep my jeans rolled up. I was testing out different lengths and meant to sew them in place once I like the way it looked but I never got around to the sewing and they&#x27;ve stayed in place for a couple months!</li>
    <li> I use these all of the time on my clothes for work.  The way most blouses are made these days you either wear a camisole or let it open up. The tape holds well.</li>
    <li> I threw these out when I received them.  It is for a one time use.  Not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it works really well.  It is EXTREMELY sticky and strong enough to hold up a large hem on jeans.  However, with jeans, I did need to pretty much line the hem with the tape to get it to stay up (so it was essentially an unbroken line of tape between the outside part and the folded-up part).  With other lighter fabrics, you probably don&#x27;t need so much.&lt;br /&gt;Can NOT wash your clothes with this tape on them, which is kind of a pain, but I&#x27;m not sure they make something that can hold up through washings.</li>
    <li> Tape is extremely easy to use and holds up nicely.  Both pants stayed hemmed all day.  Wish it were permanent instead of temporary.  Also wish there were more than 18 tapes in a package.</li>
    <li> This product is especially useful for altering the length of your favorite jeans so that the length can be adjusted according to the shoes worn with them--flats or heels.  I have had no problem with the quality.  The tapes are strong enough to hold the hem of heavy denim until removed.  My only negative is that you have to remove the tapes before laundering the jeans which necessitates the use of a new set of tape (There are only 18 tapes in a box).  If the temporary hem tapes were less expensive, this would not be a concern.  Nevertheless, I will keep buying them because of the versatility and convenience they provide.  This product is such a good idea--I wish I had thought of it myself.</li>
    <li> If you want to use this to hem pants, be prepared to use a lot, otherwise you get sagging areas...might be useful for other purposes like keeping a shirt closed, etc.</li>
    <li> I had a foot surgery and had to wear flat shoes.  I didn&#x27;t want to permanently hem my pants so I tried the tape.  The tape worked very well - I had no problems with my hems staying in place.  You need at least 4 strips of tape for each pair of pants (at least 2 on each leg) so each packet doesn&#x27;t give you very many wearings as you have to remove before each wash.  This is good if you only occasionally need a temporary hem, but less effective if you need an every day solution.  I wish the strips were reusable.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I wish I had this years ago.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this, I gave it to a bridesmaid at my wedding and she tried to use a lot of pieces of it to last minute hem her dress (she wanted to try and wear flats rather than the heels she had brought). It fell back down almost immediately. This product didn&#x27;t match what I wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> I used this to make temporary drapes out of a sheet for our new home until we can decide just what we want there permanently. Works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this hem tape for a quick solution to fix my dress pants for a school event. After following the directions perfectly, they barely lasted about 10 minutes. Some of the tape started falling down, and my pants were lopsided even before I got to the event. I was very embarrassed and disappointed in this product. To be safe just pay to get your pants hemmed.</li>
    <li> OK, I tried these. What a mess! The flimsy little thing are hard to peel off and when you finally get them off of the backing, the start folding up onto themselves. I wasted thee and finally pinned the pants him in. Great concept-not so great in results.</li>
    <li> it works but is very very expensive&lt;br /&gt;too expensive to purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s about a buck worth of double sided tape in a fancy package</li>
    <li> Used these for work pants. Great since I&#x27;m petite and pants are always a tad bit long</li>
    <li> good on light materials, do not recommend for heavy fabrics</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have the luxury of getting a pair of maternity pants properly tailored prior to wearing.  These did the trick of hemming the pants perfectly.  Stayed put through two days of trade shows.</li>
    <li> This is The most AWESOME product!!! I&#x27;m more excited that they carry ALL the items in this brand!! Your life will change once you use the Double-Sided tape for the 1st time!!! I can&#x27;t imagine wearing a scarf without this product!! Sooo thin but sooo strong!!! I wanted a heavy silk scarf to stay flipped across my shoulder all of my 9 hr work day and by the end of that shift, I had to PEEL it Off, because the tape was still so secure! LOVE the Hem Tape as well, and the Sweater Brush to wipe away piling is FAB!! Will tell ALLL my gal pals about you!!!</li>
    <li> This tape is great, although I pretty much use it like an extra wide version of the fashion tape that is also available</li>
    <li> I bought this tape to hem up a dress over my knees. It was about 2 inches that I was hemming up. I used around 8 to 10 pieces to make sure the entire hem was taped up. The back kept coming undone of my dress. The rest stayed up. I did spend 3 hours dancing away in the dress, so maybe this was made more for pants or less movement of the body. When I got home the tape came right off and no sticky residue, which was good.</li>
    <li> A temporary solution...it works briefly.  But I think scotch tape worked just as well.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy fix - stronger than double sided tape and better than staples or glue for someone like me who can&#x27;t sew and doesn&#x27;t have the time or doesn&#x27;t want to pay to have someone do it professionally. Used it on a pair of work pants (I wear infrequently) and it&#x27;s held up great! Totally worth it, can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner.</li>
    <li> Awesome product used this tape for my toddler&#x27;s holloween costume pants and it worked great the pack comes with plenty of them I totally recommend it. You just peel and stick and also you can use this for gasp in your shirts, ect.</li>
    <li> Does just what it says worked fine until I washed it by mistake! Next time I will try to remove it and see if it is reusable</li>
    <li> Was a perfect solution to a quick fix on a prom dress that was owned by someone else and was very difficult fabric.  Took out tape to clean per instructions and there was no evidence of my use of the tape.  Just amazing.</li>
