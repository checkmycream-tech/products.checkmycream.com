<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my daughter loved them and still getting to know them</li>
    <li> Only got this set thinking they would all be pink... was for a gift! And dissappointed in the sides that are the same size. :(</li>
    <li> Some balls are unevenly rounded, but they have helped me create many beautiful designs! They even came quicker than I had expected</li>
    <li> Be careful! When I received my order I was excited until I used the blue tool which the point came out and ruined my nails.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good and exactly what you see in the photos.  I use these all the time.  It take s bit of practice and finesse but pretty easy.</li>
    <li> Awesome set. Cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> For the price of these, I would say they&#x27;re not too bad! They come in a set of 5, each one a different color: blue, orange, yellow, pink, green. I gave them three stars because similarly to other reviewers, all five pens were the same size... disappointing. Also, after you dip the pen into the polish, you&#x27;re only able to make two dots at most before having to dip again. I would prefer if I could make more dots without having to reload as frequently. However, this does not affect the results of the finished product. I would probably not purchase these again in the future.</li>
    <li> I think i would have liked it if i actually got it. But I didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> These are great for decorating your own fingernails. Very inexpensive and they are pretty.</li>
    <li> The pens are very nice for doing your own designs! Makes it much easier for decaling.</li>
    <li> At less than $2, this entire set is really worth the purchase. There isnt anything really complicated about a dotting tool set that requires it to be extra sturdy, so the build quality is fine for this product. At one end of the tool, they are all the same size dotters, but other end is all graduating sizes, so you dont get 10 different size, , more like 6 sizes which is more than adequate. If you need a set fast, you should be aware that shipping takes a couple of weeks at least coz it is shipped from Hkg/China.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to use and it doesn&#x27;t create good dots. They are a waste of money and won&#x27;t make your nails look good.</li>
    <li> Dotting tool for manicure. Its exactly as it says eight differernt size balls for all your dotting needs. Or take it to your manicurist and have them use it.</li>
    <li> Just received them &amp; I already love them. The price is amazing. They don&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. The only negative thing was that she had to wait more than 3 wks for it to arrive (From overseas).  She uses it all the time and loves it.</li>
    <li> Got here quick.  awesome, thanks!!  One tip came off mid use, but I just glued it back and they&#x27;ve all worked well</li>
    <li> Perfect For Nail Art! Very Sturdy!</li>
    <li> I love this product it came a week early which made my day and the dotting tools are great i don&#x27;t know why people complain so much maybe they don&#x27;t even know how to use them but anyways i recommend this!</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are perfect, I have used them twice now. I highly reccomend them. They are very well made and easy to use, very easy to clean and they come in a convient plastic storage envelope.</li>
    <li> I bought these dotting pens for a little girl&#x27;s birthday party. We set up a manicure station and let them design their own nails. Total hit! The dotting pen set is well made and dual ended.</li>
    <li> Excited to use they are exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are very nice. there are a variety of different sizes and you can do just about any style with these.</li>
    <li> Great assorment of sizes to be used for all nail art projects.  Easy to use and clean, comfortable to hold.  GREAT PRICE and arrived in a timely manner.  I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Love the pen set; truly makes applying my dits faster &amp; better.  Love the colors of the pens also.  Shipping does take sometime, which is expected since its coming from China.</li>
    <li> this product is working very well, I&#x27;m happy with it, I&#x27;m just still in the process using it, so I&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> when using a dotting tool, for nail art, the doting tool will need to be cleaned and i use nail polish remover to clean the polish off and the dotting tool will break in half or the dotting part will fall out of the plastic</li>
    <li> I love using these dotting tools! They help make things easier for me when I do my nails. And I love how there are different sizes to use</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product, looks just like the picture. The price is also great! thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Dotting 5x2 Way Marbleizing Dotting Set arrived before time which was great. The only thing I did not like was that the tools were not in a bag. I would have prefer the tools in a bag then I would have felt that the tools was new. However, I would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I like them... It does what is supposed to do. Perfect and fast delivery. Satisfied!  Thank you! Good quality! Nice</li>
    <li> HAVING TROUBLE CREATING PERFECT POLKA DOTS WITH A SHAKY HAND??!!! WELL FEAR NO MORE! I love these dotting tools. Its an easy way to make several different dotted patterns and designs. They have several sizes and you can create everything from girly polka dots to edgy and fun designs depending on what you choose to do. I absolutely love these and will most likely will be purchasing more in the future as gifts.</li>
    <li> i love the assortment, the sizes. i was happy when they came, took these the longest to come, i would like to say, almost a month was passiing by. i ordered them the last week of May, i didnt get them until last week</li>
    <li> These are great and so many size dots to choose from! And the set came way before the date it said it would be here. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I these dotting tool are awesome says my grand daughter, I can do so much with these. I&#x27;d say thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Ok the reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because 5of the dots are somewhat the same size but i did not care much because it is still a good price rather then buying it in person.I don&#x27;t know why people are giving it such bad ratings like get over it cheapos still a great buy. Do not listen to much when people give bad reviews overall this is a great product for such a low price .people are just being dumb so what if 5 of them have similar sizes its not like you need all 10 sizes 5 is perfect.</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of money. The product is so poorly made, the heads came off when I tried doing my nails. Not to mention it took forever for me to receive it. Sometimes in trying to save some money one ends up spending more. I will not recomend this product to fellow manicurist.</li>
    <li> Hmm there is nothing much to say except they are true dotting tools. They do exactly what they are suppose to. I&#x27;m actually getting ready to use them again now for my blue design I&#x27;m doing. I also love the fact they have different sizes at each end.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted something like this for a long time! They are perfect! I have no idea why anyone is giving these such negative ratings. They are extremely sturdy, well put together and yes, they ARE ten different sizes.</li>
    <li> they are so pretty look. Very well set so it wont fall apart.. The material is really good for taking the nail polish off when you use it and the price is great!</li>
    <li> Great set of tools! Good quality!</li>
    <li> Kind of disappointed when this one showed up. One of them was broken when i received them. but i guess for the price, they weren&#x27;t bad</li>
    <li> The style of them is fantastic and they are great quality.  They are a great deal and a great product, I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I received my order very quickly. I have never used the tools- bought them to do crafting. My husband already took one set to use for painting his model kits. He has also told a friend about them who also does model kits.</li>
    <li> These are great for different size dots on nails. Haven&#x27;t used it yet for marbelizing. Very easy to use with a comfortable grip.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. If you like to try different nail art then cool product. also cheap. try it</li>
    <li> I placed my order reluctantly after reading so many bad reviews but the product came in 11 days, just as seen in the picture and they were not broken, in fact they seemed pretty sturdy. I am very relieved and very satisfied with these dotters!!</li>
    <li> Came fast, exactly what I wanted. They work great and they are fun for all ages. I have three preteens that love these tools</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these pens. They work very well for creating nail art. I have had mine for a while now and i use them all the time. I would buy these again. They are also very nice quality as well. They are worth the money.</li>
    <li> Loved the price including the product. I use them all the time doing designs on my nails and my clients. The only downside was it took close to a month to receive it. But then again it was coming from a great distance.</li>
    <li> These are great for the $$. As others have commented it&#x27;s not 10 different sized &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; but for the money you cannot beat it</li>
    <li> My daughter is an expert at nail art and was looking for dotting tools.  When I gave these to her, she was so pleased.  She uses them all the time and finds that they really add to her abilities.</li>
    <li> Definitely a great tool that pays for itself,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for them to do the same designs that you can do yourself at home with this tool!</li>
    <li> These are a fun tool for making uniformly sized and shaped dots on your nails. There is a good selection of sizes so you can make what you need. They work well and are easy to clean!</li>
    <li> First off, these dotting pens came weeks before they were scheduled to!!! I got exactly what was in the picture and they work amazing. They are perfect for any nail art designs that include dots! These tools are also very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> one of them (the orange one) snapped on me. but otherwise I think there are plenty of sizes and ive been able to do tons of new and fun designs. i like them!</li>
    <li> when i got this item in the mail my face lit up with sun shine because i knew that this product was goning to work and has never let me down. so i think you should by this product.</li>
    <li> These are great! I love the way they look but they do seem a little flimsy. I purchased almost the exact same set and they broke the day I got them but these haven&#x27;t yet so I&#x27;m keeping my hopes up! They cam in about 2-3 weeks but I don&#x27;t know for sure because they came when I was on vacation. Anyway, very good product for the most part!</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I got these. The wait was not long and it was so worth it. I will always cherish these and will buy from you again. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Nice tools for the money can not complain about them at all they get the job done! Can&#x27;t wait to have some fun seeing what nail art I can come up with</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a great deal of fun with these.  They work great and are easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the different sizes</li>
    <li> When i recieved the pacakage one of the metal pieces wasn&#x27;t attached to the pen. Then I only had the pens for a week and one of them already broke.  Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools. They are easy to use and you get a professional look! I use this in almost every manicure I do! For this price it&#x27;s a great buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter who is loving nail art, is having so much fun with these. It is a lot easier for her to make her nail creations with these!</li>
    <li> Great tools for lots of use, and love love love how cool the colors are and I can use lots of flowers</li>
    <li> These nail dotting tools are really good!  They were also incredibly cheap and arrived faster than I expected even though I didn&#x27;t even pay shipping for them.  The sizes are all pretty good and I can decorate my nails every which way with these things!</li>
    <li> Excellent tools that work like a charm! Received products just as described and couldnt be happier!! Highly recommend to anyone interested in nail art!</li>
    <li> These dotting tolls have multiple sizes which is great for nail art and designs. I use this tool all the time.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Perfect condition and works great would tell anyone who does nails to pick these up all different sizes there great! And ya can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Liked this it works well for designs</li>
    <li> This was one of the items my daughter wanted for her birthday. A good item for nail design. This was a good buy.</li>
    <li> I got these because they were super affordable and I needed real dotting tools rather than using a toothpick.  While it ends up being more like 5 or 6 different sizes rather than the 10 advertised, it&#x27;s still worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fast shipping, product as described, will purchase from again, I got these for my daughter and I and we love them...they saved our pencils from having paint on them...lol yes we were using pencils as dotters...</li>
    <li> I just tried these yesterday and I have to say, practice before you decide what design to do! I thought I would be able to know exactly what to do but it didn&#x27;t happen.  Not that this degrades the quality.  I like that they come in different colors so you won&#x27;t get confused with which one you just used.  Quality is great, they don&#x27;t feel cheap at all. Definitely a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m gonna get the best of this dots because I&#x27;m very artistic  I just order one and I got two</li>
    <li> These make its so simple for polka dot designs. The different sizes help you get creative and it&#x27;s so easy. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased these tools.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for these items I love them! I realize I had troubles the first time but now it&#x27;s all good thank you.</li>
    <li> I received this about 3 days after i ordered it which was a PLUS.  I love how it came packaged in a little plastic case.  I also like how they are smaller than the typical dotting tools.  Comfortable, and colorful.</li>
    <li> Nicer in person. Better quality than expected. Great selection of sizes. Easy to grip for more accurate designs. Very happy! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> They came earlier than expected and I love the variety of sizes given. One end of each pen is the same size however.</li>
    <li> They are great! when I do my nails each design comes out more prettier then the last. Over all its nice!</li>
    <li> love the price, the different colors but two of them broke and two of the silver end pins just came out. I only used a couple times and they are stored in a safe place and still broke on me. recommend something eles not these.</li>
    <li> I received my package sooner than the expected arrival date. I have since tried them out and I love them.  It was a great deal since I only paid $1 for them.  Would definitely recommend as a cheap nail art tool!</li>
    <li> I like te heavyness, the colors, it doesn&#x27;t slip of your hands when you are using it, good quality and pretty :)</li>
    <li> These are great...to decorate your nails!! Bought 2 extra sets for granddaughters!! Nice sturdy plastic and wide assortment of tips !!</li>
    <li> These pens work great. You dip the ends in mail polish and gently dot your finger or toenails and you&#x27;ll get a perfect dot every time.</li>
    <li> Stuff works as advertised,  comes in different sizes, cheap, worth the dollar spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the flashiness is pretty cool too.</li>
    <li> More teen trending videos promote this product.  For the price - almost nothing with free shipping - these are a bargain.  When they are not on sale, consider using pin heads or nails as replacement products.  But they speedily came from China and make the girl happy...</li>
    <li> I love them they are just great and easy to use they are perfect!! And the colors and soo pretty too it&#x27;s a must get</li>
    <li> I do really like these and they don&#x27;t feel/look cheap even though they are. One of the dotting tools though the metal end popped out but I think I can super glue it back. Just be warned.</li>
    <li> So I looked at all the youtube videos about making your own dotting tools out of toothpicks, etc.  The downside of those was that those little DIY tools would end up breaking down (wood does not play well with nail polish remover).  I finally broke down and decided to get actual dotting tools because I was so fed up with having to  re-construct a tool every time I did my nails.  Imagine my delight when I found out these were suuuuper cheap!  The downside is that the shipping from Asia took FOREVER, but patience is a virtue.</li>
    <li> I love constantly changing my nail color and putting different designs on my nails. These dotting pens have made it possible for me to effectively create unique art on my nails.</li>
    <li> I bought this exact same set for my daughter and paid quite a bit more. Very versatile, sturdy and quite easy to use.</li>
    <li> Two of these broke rather quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product, allowed me to easily take my art skills and apply them to finger nails, all my clients are lovingthe qualit of the product. Easy to apply and long lasting. Highly recommended and will be getting more Immediately. Works perfectly with templates or free hand, very affordable / excellent price. I would say alot of bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> I love my Dotting Pen Set. Its a set of 5 and it comes in a white plastic case. Each end has a different size. They are good quality.</li>
    <li> My set came all pink :) Delivery was faster than most. They make the perfect dots and in many different sizes, i have no complaints here!</li>
    <li> I redo my nails at least 2-3 times a week and I never just paint them a solid color. These make the process of finishing my designs so much faster. They work great for putting dots on your design as well as using them as a paintbrush alternative for larger areas. They are so much better to use than a toothpick like I had to use before purchasing these. I highly recommend these to everyone who has trouble making precise dots and designs on their nails.</li>
    <li> i ordered this set for my daughters christmas gift  it came in plenty of time &amp; was well packed for shipping  she just loves it [[ASIN:B004OHQR1Q 5 X 2 Way Marbleizing Dotting Pen Set for Nail Art Manicure Pedicure]]  linda h</li>
    <li> This dotting tools are great when you have a hard time dotting. I normally use a toothpick and I hate it so I purchased this set and it cuts the stress of making cute polka-dots. Great product!</li>
    <li> I received this in less time I expected! They are good for the price it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Works great and had very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Some of the heads popped out but I repaired them with super glue, other than that They work just fine, got them different sized &amp; same colored.</li>
    <li> I had several break withing just months of buying them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no professional, I just have a mild hobby of doing my nails. Did my nails last night, after I received them and had the time to do my nails. VERY easy to use!!! Kiiiinda wish the rod was longer, so I could just dip it into the bottle of polish, but putting one drop of polish at a time on a piece of magazine or foil works pretty well too. Lots of great ideas to use all over the internet, and tutorials on youtube :) I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> exactly like picture each end was a different size i got them super super fast non were broken love them they are overall great for the price.</li>
    <li> I loved these so much I had to buy a set for my mom. They make perfect dots for your nails and are super easy to do even on yourself!</li>
    <li> Takes a long time to arrive but the price and quality is great!</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. I ordered the dotting pen set and ended up with some little bow tie things I assume are supposed to be nail decorations. I did not want those I wanted the pens</li>
    <li> They are the same color and took to long to get them.</li>
    <li> These items broke very quickly</li>
    <li> Paid 2.05 and when the package was opened they also sent me a $1 bill along with my dotting tools so it&#x27;s like I got them for almost free. Also got them earlier than expected delivery. They look very nice and I can&#x27;t wait to use them. I&#x27;ll definitely recommend to friends and family!</li>
    <li> Received it the quality is very good.  Built tuff and they look so delicate I absolutely love this,  I highly recommend this product and the seller received it sooner than anticipated.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The tips loosen up easily and quickly and fall off. Buy some super glue along with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to be delivered but they were inexpensive and do the job.</li>
    <li> These dotting pens came about 2 weeks earlier than expected so I was very happy to begin with. The packaging was fine and they arrived in great condition. The other reviews saying there are really only 6 different tips rather than 10 are correct. However, I knew to expect this and don&#x27;t know what other types of tips there could have possibly been since the 6 were such a wide variety, so I&#x27;m fine with it! Nice quality, nice price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!! Shipping took a while ( 17 to 18 days) but I say it&#x27;s worth it! After about two weeks after I got them, one end of the green fell off and same with the pink one! I just glued them back together and everything was fine. Definitely recommend if u r looking for some good quality dotting tools!</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars if it had come with examples of designs to create. I love using them, but I had to look up design ideas on my own. There are some people that are not creative and might need more options. Otherwise great product, fabulous price, and fast shipping</li>
    <li> these look exactly like the picture shown. As mentioned in other reviews, there are only 6 different sizes, not 10- but I don&#x27;t see this as a problem, since there is a good range of sizes.  This item shipped really quickly, considering it came from the other side of the world.</li>
    <li> All of the tips broke on my dotters. These are cheap and I don&#x27;t recommend wasting your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I love using them and I really like them, so I do recommend them to nail fashionistas. Also awesome for making flowers.</li>
    <li> They work nicely. It has a nice range of sizes even with one of the ends being the same size on each.</li>
    <li> I got these really quick in the mail and was really excited to use them. They&#x27;re excellent for drawing dots, flowers, etc....very convenient how it&#x27;s double sided with a smaller dot. I don&#x27;t even need to get any nail art brushes.</li>
    <li> not just for painting nails, great for other art projects too</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for these dotting pens.&lt;br /&gt;you get 5 of them for such a great price :) !</li>
    <li> These are some good quality nail dotting pens.  i think there are five or six different points from extremely small to rather large.  I even use these instead of my nail brushes.  And the price?  It cant be beat.</li>
    <li> They arrived sooner then excepted and they look amazing. Plus I can now do so many amazing desgins. I think what I got is good for what I payed so overall im happy.</li>
    <li> This is the best ever. You can do so many designs with these tools.&lt;br /&gt;I it really a great investment. I only paid $1 and you just cant beat the prize.</li>
    <li> Great set of dotting tools. Not every end is different sizes (one half is all different but the others are all the same) but I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast. Started using it the same day i received them. They all have different sizes and make perfect dots. I had been used to making dots with an item from home, once I used this product, I found it hard to make my dots from largest to smallest. After using this product several times I figured the best way to make the same effect.</li>
    <li> I started using it for home pedicure.  It helped me with simple flower design in doing my pedicure esp when I try to do my own and miss a trip to the nail salon.</li>
    <li> very fun idea to do nails at home.  I like the twirly pattern and the multi sizes are great ....</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Easy to use tools with a great variety of styles.  Grips are pleasant and sturdy.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t stop designing with these things. Their awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Super cute, work well, and you can&#x27;t beat the cost. The only issue I have is that the sizes aren&#x27;t labeled and its hard to tell some sizes apart.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews that the set doesn&#x27;t come with all different ball sizes. However, that was NOT the case for me. All five pens came with decending ball sizes and no two sizes are the same. They work great for nail art, be it using it for dotting or picking up decals to press on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material&#x27;s quality is good for what it is (hard plastic handle and metal points). I can see that if taken cared of, this could last years - until I sit on it, haha! Overall, a great buy :)</li>
    <li> Very fun way to make several designs my kids can spend hours painting there nails with different designs. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my dotting tools, thanks so pretty much!</li>
    <li> I purchased these about 2 days ago and recieved it today. I came to realize that some of the reviews are true. There are 5 dotting tools yet, only one size on one end and 4 different sizes on the other end. Reason I say 4 sizes is because 2 are alike. But you cant beat it for the price nor the designs you can create! Otherwise im happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you see here, but the shipping was god aweful</li>
    <li> These work perfect for dots and making detailed designs. They have a solid feel to them, very sturdy. Plus they look really neat too!</li>
    <li> i have used mine many times it is very useful for tiny writing or symbols on my nails also good to do children&#x27;s nails</li>
    <li> Bought these on a whim.  Its a new toy, don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing but having fun (and getting compliments).  How can you go wrong with polka dots?</li>
    <li> I love these nail pens!  I initially thought they would be passed on to my teenage goddaughter, but not so fast!  The 5 pens I received have a variety of tip sizes.  I went to a cocktail party last night and used the smallest tip to put silver dots on the tips of my neutral colored nails.  They looked elegant with my black velvet dress.  Today I wore a red sweater and painted larger red dots on my nails.  I teacher young adults, and I think I have a couple of new clients for these pens! You can go as subtle or dramatic as you want, and the pens are fairly easy to hold and keep steady.  I did find that I needed to play around a bit to get the feel of the different size tips and the degree of pressure needed to make perfect circles. Holding the pens at a 90-degree angle to the nail worked well for me.  You have to have little containers for each color nail polish you are using, so I bought tiny plastic cups like the ones that are given with pills in hospitals.  The only downside I can see with this item is that if you already have a manicure, you have to be pretty careful when painting on the dots, or you will have to re-do your entire nail from scratch. Just practice for a couple of minutes first.  This is a very fun product for young and old!</li>
    <li> i love these very high quality a lot of sizes!!! good price for such great products! very easy to use i have nothing bad to say at all!!!!!</li>
    <li> It gave good designs and is very easy to use even for a beginner</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase, they arrived pretty quickly, and the price was very reasonable as well, and the quality of the dotting pens seem pretty sturdy</li>
    <li> Good service, attention, and I&#x27;m satisfied! Buy it! Pret a la porter! Enjoy! ;-). I painted my nails with my creativity and looks wow!</li>
    <li> I always wanted dotting tools and these were the only ones I found online. Although  they came all the way from Hong Kong and took almost a month to get here, they cam out to be awesome. all the different size tools are nice to make designs for my nails.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the pens because they are a gift for my oldest daugther.I hope she likes them I just have to find the stuff to go with them.</li>
    <li> This came in much sooner than expected.  My daughter has been using them on her fingers and toes.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!!!  I have even ordered her some brushes.</li>
    <li> I am pretty new to doing my own nail art but am pretty handy with artsy stuff, so I thought I&#x27;d give these tools a go. Their swirly design is super fun and it helps to have multiples of the same dot in case you are going back and forth between two colors of polish.    What I didn&#x27;t like was that the dot sizes are all very close to one another in size - I have ridiculously tiny hands (and fingernails) so I thought small dots would be best, but honestly, some of these are like the tip of a blunted pencil. A dot that size could barely be seen on my hand. I was disappointed there weren&#x27;t some meatier-sized dots in case I wanted to do a bold polka dot or an oversized flower.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmotologist who does nails and nail art. These are the perfect tool for dots and any design made with dots including making a straight or curved line. They were so cheap and work just as good as anything purchased at a supply store for much more money. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> They dont sugar coat anything with selling this product. Don&#x27;t give a bad review over things that are clearly stated in &amp;#34;customer questions &amp;#34;. Also in the pics it shows that some of the sizes are more than likely going to be similar. Great product, and price!</li>
    <li> Love these tools,does what it says</li>
    <li> These were a great bargain! They appear well made and look like the picture. One of the stylus is missing the ball but for the price it wasn&#x27;t worth complaining or sending it back $1.65 including shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my own homemade dotting tool but it&#x27;s great to actually have a set with defined different sizes.  Shipping took awhile but it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy these dotting tools.  Great price for handy tools.  Did have one tip fall out of the plastic handle, but easy fix to super glue it back in...good as new.</li>
    <li> I love these dotters! They look cute, and have added a lot to my nail designs :) I&#x27;m also very happy with having 10 different sizes to chose from :)</li>
    <li> I dont like that the other end is all the same size on all of them and they dont tell you that! Other then that I like them and they work well!</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for teenagers and they absolutely loved it. THey are able to add neat designs with this pen set! Great item and great gift!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been able to create some neat dots using these tools, but the handle is a little to wide to fit into my gel polish bottle.  My work around for this issue is to dab polish from the polish brush onto the dotting tool.  The good thing is that gel polish doesn&#x27;t dry out, so I can take my time with using the dotting tools.  They are easy to clean. I just use alcohol and a paper towel.  Really good product for beginners.  My YouTube video can be viewed at: http://youtu.be/WCiJFH9vg1U  AND another video can be viewed at: http://youtu.be/yvP2jl7ebQo</li>
    <li> These are perfect for dotting or doing little things with nails. I am not good at doing fancy nail stuff so these helped a ton because of the different sized dots.</li>
    <li> perfect for use doing nail art!</li>
    <li> NOT WORTH ANYTHING.   I received these dotters after a month long wait and to top it all off as soon as I opened them  2 OF THE 5 were already broken! I used one of the non-broken pens and the needle slipped out!   complete trash. SO INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> Perfect for nail art and a great price. Love these tools!</li>
    <li> im kind of just starting doing nails , and this product was amazing it make it way easier to do my designs . there also very beautiful</li>
    <li> I love it! It is very nice. I like the colors they come in. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have already used these multiple times with many different designs. They&#x27;re so easy to use and always produce the desired result!</li>
    <li> I have ordered several of these and they work great! Give them a try. Arrival was a bit slow but worth it.</li>
    <li> Just like in the salon! Good tools, especially for the price. The different colors and sizes will fit every need.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet but I&#x27;m leaving 5 stars anyway. They came earlier than expected, and the quality for the price is outstanding. I also received a dollar with my order. Haha, not sure why and it&#x27;s only a dollar but I am very pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> the tip keep falling off</li>
    <li> Got it thanks! Will be perfect for Christmas presents for my neices! They will love it for nail time with mommy.</li>
    <li> When I received the dotting tools one of the tips was completely loose (I figured because it shipped all the way from China) No biggie though, I just threw some super glue into the tip well and returned the tip to its place until it dried. Most of the tips are relatively the same size, but I haven&#x27;t complained since it was less than $2 INCLUDING SHIPPING!!!! They&#x27;ve lasted me over a year already and will probably continue to service me as long as they are kept clean.</li>
    <li> They are not very small to get really delicate designs.</li>
    <li> Just amazing! And for that price! Just go for it you won&#x27;t regret it! :D I&#x27;m actually buying another set to give as a present to my manicurist.</li>
    <li> Im not very artistic but I started doing my own nails about a year ago. These tools have helped me come up with creative designs that look professional done</li>
    <li> These dotting tools work great! The only complaint I have is that I expected there to be many different sized dotting tips considering there are 5 double sided dotting tools, but really there are only 3 different sized tips (that I could tell, and that others I asked could tell). Some of the pictures even make it look like there&#x27;s a wider variety of sizes. Despite this, I would still buy this product again because of the great price.</li>
    <li> these dotting tools are great!!! I would refer these tools to anyone who loves to do nails... Easy to hold... I love the different sizes that you have to choose from. I would buy these again,again...</li>
    <li> This is a great set of nail dotting tools.  It takes a little practice if you haven&#x27;t used them before.  But, the price is great and the tools are of good quality!</li>
    <li> got these for my sister and she likes them :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my niece (teenager) I have seen amazing design she made on her own nails, a do it self, and she is very happy with the resuls</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent set of dotting tools ever since I bought a nail brush set. The dotting tool that came with the set was way too small for any design. These dotting tools do their job perfectly. I&#x27;d recommend these to any nail art enthusiast. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t use these very often, if you have the time to do some interesting nail art, these are a great tool to have. There is a size &amp;#34;dot&amp;#34; for everyone, and they are easy to clean with a quick wipe.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved her new set!</li>
    <li> Love love love! Every size I need is there, they arrived right on time, and I can&#x27;t get enough of them. They are so easy to use and are just perfect.</li>
    <li> Got these in the mail and one of the metal pieces was detached from the plastic part.  Also most of these are the same size. I wont even bother returning or complaining since they are so cheap.</li>
    <li> Thought they were alot cheaper than sallys and other brand stores. Definitely worth every cent of my money. Would definitely buy again from this user.</li>
    <li> Great items, super cute and surprisingly sturdy. I love using the different colors for different purposes!</li>
    <li> My girls are pros now with nail art.  Fun and all different size dots/drops.&lt;br /&gt;It did take a little practice to know exactly how much nail polich to use - but the learning curve was still fun.</li>
    <li> Great for decorating fingernails</li>
    <li> These are great! I got these for polymer clay, And for that they work great! no marks or anything on the tips! I also used them for what they were made for (nails) and they work great too! Can&#x27;t think of anything bad with these!</li>
    <li> They work great, good price and good product. Exactly like they described. Pretty and they are not cheap and brittle.</li>
    <li> Works great, just what I expected. Got here early</li>
    <li> Easy to use, pretty too!  looking for an easy way to do nails at home, and this was in expensive tool that make it super eash</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift. She loved them.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it, but it was a little below our expectations. It was pretty easy to use, but sometimes when dotting, there would be a hole in the middle of the dot. Overall, good product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> lots of options in sizes, easy to use and clean, small they do not take up much space for storage</li>
    <li> One of the best nail products I could have bought. Sooo worth it and I already recommended it to my two co-workers who are not professionals like myself.</li>
    <li> I probably should have just stuck with a bobby pin. One of the ends on the white one came out as I was taking it out of the package. But they are cute and for 2 bucks quality was not really a priority.</li>
    <li> good quality for the price</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and they came in on time! They do exactly what they say with no disappointment I would recommend to buy this! I mean for the price they actually work!</li>
    <li> It took forever to get here considering it came from China but nonetheless it arrived in great condition and in appropriate packaging.  The picture shows that they are all pink when in reality they are all different colors other than that I am satisfied with this product and will refer people to it.</li>
    <li> Great buy. It waa delivered very quickly.  The dots are amazing. And reusable. I love the product. Now I can do the nails myself instead of going to get them done.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS PERFECT.  IT CAME ON TIME AND IT WORKS.  THIS IS A GREAT GIFT IDEA OR SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF.</li>
    <li> These things are so great and convenient to have. You can create so many designs with your own nail polishes which is what I love the most. No need to use those felt tip nail art brushes that are so awkward to use.</li>
    <li> I use the dotting tool for cleaning around the cuticle when using gel.  It gets everything off nicely. Use to clean away under the nail as well.</li>
    <li> If you are interested in doing nail art and would like to ditch the toothpicks then this is for you.  Several options of sizes will help with dots and designs of nails.  Well made and received in a timely manner considering they were coming from Hong Kong.  Would recommend this product. Makes a great gift for girls of all ages.</li>
    <li> my daughters and I do each others nails, I got these really quick in the mail and was really excited to use them. They&#x27;re excellent for drawing dots, flowers, mickey mouse, etc....very convenient how it&#x27;s double sided with a smaller dot. I don&#x27;t even need to get any nail art brushes.</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools! I love making designs and now My nails are look super cute these work pretty good!</li>
    <li> Just what you would expect, good at making dots and saves on me running to the toothpicks for every little detail.</li>
    <li> i find it hard to get a circle i wish it was a flat bottom then it would be amazing</li>
    <li> She loved it &amp; all the many sizes.  I loved the price.  She can&#x27;t wait to start using them ASAP!!</li>
    <li> Items arrived within 2 weeks of placing the order. However, the dotting pens I received were not the same pens that are shown for sale. Instead of being all pink the ones I was sent are all different colors. Not really a big deal but something the buyer should be aware of.</li>
    <li> I have not get my dotting tools i order so if u can let me know what&#x27;s going on with my order plz and thank u</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product for a great price. I received before they told me and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I got 5 tools of the same size I thought they were suppose to be 10 different sizes not 2 different sizes on all 5 of the tool</li>
    <li> I would give it a 5, but one of the ends constantly falls off although I&#x27;ve tried to super glue it back on. These are great tools for designing.</li>
    <li> A few of my dotting tips slipped out of the handling area...other than that this dotter works great for designs</li>
    <li> These tools make doing my own nail designs and adding rhinestones very easy. They seem to be well made and just as described. I have no complaints with my order. I received it earlier than expected. I do wish tracking would have been available. Good product and a good price.</li>
    <li> when i pay for this item i think original but it is made in china , bad quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Meshal</li>
    <li> I love it! and it is true 5 of the dot sizes are the same but i can live with it...</li>
    <li> these are heavy and thick and sturdy and 10 different sizes in nice plastic holder,&lt;br /&gt;wasn&#x27;t expecting much since paid so low of a price but these are great</li>
    <li> Love them!!! I&#x27;ve already done sooo many cool designs with them</li>
    <li> This is a very useless product. I tried using it, and overall it just looks messy and you can use a toothpick to get the same effects. I do not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this is good for. It didn&#x27;t make perfect circles on my nails either. I might have been using it wrong because it did not come with any instructions or anything.</li>
    <li> Great set for the price. My daughter uses them all of the time for various nail designs. The only con and reason for only 4 stars is that a lot of the balls on the ends are exactly the same size. There&#x27;s no pattern to it either because some are the same on both ends and then that same tip will be on another handle with a different size on opposite end.  They are still a great price and though they came from China they were shipped out quickly and showed up quickly. Plus the design is really pretty &amp; mesmerizing! I&#x27;d recommend these to a friend.</li>
    <li> got them on time looked great but with in one da the big green one lost the dot tool, like it just came off. other than that you get what they say.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product and very glad I purchased it at such a great cost! I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a dotting pen and you get five with different sizes. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I got my order today and I was surprised to say that it was awesome to know my stuff came in one piece and it looked new.</li>
    <li> Maybe it was just my order but I didn&#x27;t get many different sizes dotting tools. I was hoping to get a variety but didn&#x27;t. I will still use them just not exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I used them to put dots on toes. Only thing is on the 2nd end all of them have the same size ball.</li>
    <li> Great product, helps the granddaughters to make awesome designs on all our nails.  Lots cheaper for me to get a pedicure</li>
    <li> Used it twice, and rusting at the tips. Do not get these kinds.</li>
    <li> These dotting pens work great. I have really enjoyed them. I&#x27;m not very good at dotting so these have been great and made it so easy.</li>
    <li> These dooting tools are great, and incredible simple to use. The come in a range of sizes which helps with a multitude of designs.</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools! They were very cheap in price and very pretty in person.</li>
    <li> what a bargain price for these! just got mine but haven&#x27;t used them yet. they look just like my avon ones so im sure they will do the job. they are not pink like the picture they are multi colored but still happy with them.</li>
    <li> they are easy to use and make nice designs. i love them im not good  at doing designs but when i use these it looks great.</li>
    <li> Good quality and variety of sizes.</li>
    <li> Finally received the dotting pen, but one of them was broken. I am not sure if thats b/c the extremely weather? Or during the shipping?</li>
    <li> I loved this dotting pen set, they come in a white case that you can keep them in and they are a good quality. Also my pen set came in very fast, it came to my home 2 days before the expected arrival. So I think that this is a very nice dotting pen set to buy.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description of the product well enough.  It wasn&#x27;t what I thought.  Probably will not use it, at least not for it&#x27;s intended use.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools work great, and are a great price, I have no complaints. I am able to do many designs with the different sizes available.</li>
    <li> I love the price for something I use constantly on my nail art. It is made of very nice material. I would definetly buy from again in the future if needed. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great deal, but be prepared to take 4-6 weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> Came in quickly in a cute little clear pouch to keep then together. Awesome &amp; does job, but one broke almost immediately, I&#x27;m not sure how. Otherwise I&#x27;ve had them for months and always work very well.</li>
    <li> I am always painting my nails. I use these to make dots and free hand designs. They give you much more control than a brush and it&#x27;s easy to use with your non dominate hand. If you want to take your nail art to the next step, buy these.</li>
    <li> I like using the dotting pens but I was a little disappointed that you actually only get 6 different sizes, not 10. All of them on one end are the same size. I was also disappointed that my pink one arrived broken. I almost sent it back but I just glued and taped it and hope this will hold it together. They do work well and are fun to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really not that useful unless you are really into doing nails.</li>
    <li> First off, these look adorable. Mine happen to be pink and I love the way they look.&lt;br /&gt;I would say I use these about every other day to every three days.&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be very durable and I have had no problems with them.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy these for a friend.</li>
    <li> i love doing my nails and these are perfect though two of  pens seem like they are the same size. other than that i love them.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect tools for nail art! I love how simple it is for dotting and other art. I can finally say goodbye to my toothpicks!</li>
    <li> very good. thank you. dont know much how to use all the different sides, i mainly bought it for the dotting but so far so good</li>
    <li> These nail dotters are amazing, and yes, i would definitely buy them again. But before you buy them, let me just tell you that although there are different sizes, on each nail dotter there is one end that is the same size. So unfortunately you&#x27;re not going to get ten different sizes, but instead you&#x27;ll get six.</li>
    <li> Really enjoying these dotting tools, just recently purchased them for a friend, too! You get double the tools for a cheap price :)</li>
    <li> This item shipped on time, great product.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love using these for creating a fun look to your nails. Can&#x27;t beat this price too!</li>
    <li> Perfect Amazing&lt;br /&gt;Wow . The most Perfect the best dotting tool ever! MUST BUY! I love it! great price Perfect!</li>
    <li> Granddaughter very happy and surprised that I got her this gift.  Fun for the kids and their friends.  They love it.</li>
    <li> I would have to agree with every single past review because these tools were a disappointment. I have been waiting for over a month to get them and when I finally do, 2 needles just slipped right off as I was taking them out of their packaging! Plus I only had 5 dotting sizes instead of the advertised 10!!! What&#x27;s worse is that I got 2 packs, one for myself and the other for a friend who also has been wanting dotting tools for some time. Both sets had needles falling off and their sizes were not as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed and one thing is for sure, I am not buying from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product, it was a great price, so you can&#x27;t beat it.  my sister and I like to do each other&#x27;s nails and play with different designs.</li>
    <li> This is a must if you are into nail painting, arts and crafts, or just regular painting. It is so helpful when you know how to utilize it properly. I do a lot of nail painting so this works very well for me. This is a must buy product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many dotting pens for months now and these are the best dotting pens for me.</li>
    <li> These work great,all different sizes,I&#x27;m no professional but I was able to use these with no problem</li>
    <li> Bought this for my tween daughter. She loves them. Trying so many designs. Even using them to design her younger sisters nails. Having so much fun!</li>
    <li> I have been able to do so many new and cool designs to my nails. I absolutely love these things</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my daughter. They didn&#x27;t come with instructions. I&#x27;m going to have to go online to find out how to use them.</li>
    <li> Great tools for many designs . Nail art without being a pro . Sturdy tools</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, she uses them all the time to decorate nails. Has so many different sizes.Good price and quality.</li>
    <li> I got my product right on time and i love the fact that theres different sizes but there not as durable two already broke although i love the variety of the sizes the fun color and the speed that my product got to me i wish they wore metal so that i wouldn&#x27;t have to buy more again</li>
    <li> Love these! This is as cheap as it gets, and it&#x27;s great quality!</li>
    <li> Use them all the time.  Perfect price.</li>
    <li> For something so cheap...it&#x27;s really good quality. I STILL have mine in top shape till this day! Worth every little penny..same product in Sally&#x27;s for 5x the price if more. Great find an buy!</li>
    <li> The items are very well made, though they ripped the packaging they were in and no instructions on how to clean or use them came with it.</li>
    <li> Love these dotting tools! They are fun and easy to use. I have seen people comment on only 6 different size tips instead of 10 (since there are 5 tools) but I have not lacked in making some fun designs! Also, you can get a great variety of dot sizes from just one tool based on how much nail polish is on it. If you are on the fence about buying them believe me they are worth it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful Idea. Gives you many different sizes of dots for your nail art. I recommend this over bobby pins. Would buy again</li>
    <li> 5 sticks came in a cute pouch.  Shipping was pretty quick.  Only thing is I wish all dotters were different sizes.  5 of one side are all different, but the other side is all same size.  Other than that, they&#x27;re cute and enables you to be creative with nail designs</li>
    <li> I love these so much!! Some of the dots are the same size, but there is a great variety and they come in a cute little case</li>
    <li> Before purchasing I read the reviews and I was at least expecting six different sizes.  I actually got two sizes only.  I basically got the same pen five times.  It works fine but overall I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Cheap and comes apart easy</li>
    <li> I use these all the time! They&#x27;re great and cheap!</li>
    <li> Looking forward to using these. My nieces are young and like having their nails done. Now Auntie can do something extra special for them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to nail art so it will take some patience, but this does exactly what I expected.  Thx for the prompt service.</li>
    <li> Most of the dots are similar in size. I wish it came with some larger dots, like maybe one the size of a pin bubble head. Nonetheless, great value for $1.49!</li>
    <li> I love them, to easy to work with them.</li>
    <li> This is a great assortment of dotters - there&#x27;s one on each end.  I have a lot of fun using them and creating different designs.  They clean up really well with regular remover.</li>
    <li> Love using these on the girls and myself! Took a few tries to get the hang of it, but at this price and so many designs to try, you can&#x27;t go wrong! Purchased a set for my niece too!</li>
    <li> I was getting pretty sick of using toothpicks, so I gave in and got these dotting tools. They are a really great deal. However, as other reviewers have said, you only get different sizes on one size of each tool. So rather than having 10 different sizes as advertised, you have 6 different sizes. But anyway, they&#x27;re great, sturdy, look pretty, and I get a lot of use out of them.</li>
    <li> You just simply cannot beat this price. My estimated shipping was almost a month long, which is typical with anything shipping from China or any other place out of country, and I actually ended up receiving them in under 2 weeks! Can&#x27;t beat this kind of quality and quickness in delivery for a little over a dollar$$!! Whooo-hooo! I&#x27;ve seen dotting tools elseware that look exactly like the ones I received for almost 10 dollars! It&#x27;s incredible what you save if you can just be patient enough to wait for shipping! I love the colors, I love the design inside the pencil, I love the variation in dotting sizes! I read some of the 1 star reviews before purchasing, but I figured, EHH what&#x27;s a dollar just to see how they are. The 5 stars and even 4 stars farrrrr surpass the 1 and 2 star reviews! I am extremely happy with my purchase! So glad I ordered them!</li>
    <li> what can i say i love dotting tools great no complaints here thank u very much to who ever invented them</li>
    <li> These came fast! They&#x27;re nice quality, and I love using them. I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far. It says that it&#x27;s 5 x 2 so 10 when really there are 10 tips in 6 sizes. 5 of the tips are all different but the opposite sides are all the same. Not really a problem, there&#x27;s still a lot of sizes, and it comes in handy if you&#x27;re doing multiple colors at once.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these. Dotting set always comes in handy and these were cheap, cheap, cheap!  ( in a good way) :)</li>
    <li> My thirteen year old daughter has created some amazing nail art since she got these. They are coming from China so it took almost 3 weeks to get these, but the price is great.</li>
    <li> My dotting pens are great I love them!! I work with kids and do the kids nails all the time they love it and the price was great!!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome I use them all the time and they are great tools for manicure/pedicure designs! If you love doing your nails, I think it&#x27;s definitely necessary to buy these!</li>
    <li> love these!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re super cute and every dotter has a different size so it brings you an awesome variety of what you can do with your designs!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them. Very durable, gets the job done perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools, I use them all the time. Its usually hard for me to do designs on my nails because I can only really use my right hand, but these made using my left hand super simple.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t break in packaging and I have used them a lot I would definitely buy these for a friend</li>
    <li> I didn´t use them much, cause I got a lot of them. But as always, they work great. You need to see what works best for you on how to use it, but its a good product for an excellent price. After use, you can dip the top in nailpolish remover and the polish comes of right away.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would make perfect polka dots, but it doesn&#x27;t. I would not buy this type of product again.</li>
    <li> If you like to do nail art these are perfect. It may take you a bit to learn to use them to do more than dots. Just make sure as you are doing your nails to have some cotton balls dipped in polish remover to clean the tools every little bit or you get gooey polish dots and lines and the polish will string out like gum.</li>
    <li> these are great! they are a quality product and have the perfect variety of sizes. Perfect for nail art  :)</li>
    <li> I USED THESE TO PUT DESIGNS ON MY TOES, AND I JUST LOVE HOW I HAVE A CHOICE TO USE DIFFERENT SIZES. I JUST LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This product is good to have, but one of my pens arrived and the tip is croocked. It works, but I have to be careful with it!</li>
    <li> The pack is exactly as shown, with all the sizes included. the design is also very pretty. It works well and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised people still complain considering the great price.</li>
    <li> Look nice but started falling apart right away selling wouldn&#x27;t replace without a picture I don&#x27;t have a camer phone</li>
    <li> This dotting set is the set that everybody has, because it&#x27;s the best. Takes a while to get here, but they are a tenth of the price online as in a beauty supply store. I do recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> Very high quality for the price. No complaints.</li>
    <li> They are perfect for my Tux nails!&lt;br /&gt;They are so cute!! I&#x27;m going to do tiger nails next so awesome&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I got these THANK YOU SELLER haha</li>
    <li> its a great tool to use ive been on youtube looking at all the different art work on nails and now i can do my own at home.</li>
    <li> This is a great cheap doting tool ideal for every single nail art you want. They  come in 8 different sizes.</li>
    <li> love this dotting tools i dont know for some reason was expecting them to be bigger kind of like the size of a pen but they are smaller they look super cute.and work perfectly! Shipping took about 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> My daughter turned 14 last month and wanted nail painting/designing supplies. She was so excited when she got these, she is still learning how to use them but she says they work great! They were a great price and we are so glad that we got them!</li>
    <li> i got 5 different tip sizes - contrary to someone saying they got all the same sizes. very cute and simple to use. gave a few out to friends</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure why all of the other reviews say that they got tips that were all the same- mine were all different shaped! I was kinda hesitant to order these because I wanted a variety, and all of the reviews said that they didn&#x27;t get one- but I did!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a couple years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these dotting tools for years and they are still being used today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Everyone has them so it&#x27;s easy to follow nail art tutorials on YouTube&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-Come in 8 different sizes&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to remove old polish&lt;br /&gt;-Fair price&lt;br /&gt;-Endless designs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-As time goes on, some of them will break, but thanks to the great price you can easily repurchase them</li>
    <li> I love the design of these Dotting Pens! They are super cute, and are exactly like they look in the picture! They come in this somewhat durable plastic package, so there is no need to buy a package to keep these together. They are also easy to clean with nail polish remover. This arrived early, in a bubble wrap bag--good service! A great product.</li>
    <li> I love the dotters! I got them in just a few days of ordering and I am saving myself tons of money doing my own nail designs.</li>
    <li> Well built tools.  One end of each tool is the same size, while the other ends are all different, lending being used for a variety of designs.</li>
    <li> These are actually pretty sturdy.  Way more well made than I thought they would be for the price.  I use them for my nails and my paintings.  They are great.</li>
    <li> I love this product they came in on time it works excellent I have been using a toothpick for years I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of sooner to go to Amazon great price and they&#x27;re very cute too</li>
    <li> I love this set of dotting tools and use them all the time. HOWEVER. One end of the dotting tool has the same size tip as all the other pens...so really you are only getting six sizes, not ten as it would seem. So its kind of a rip-off in that sense. You can also find this set way cheaper on Ebay. I paid about $2 for mine. The pictures on here are deceiving- they have the yellow pen backwards to make it look like the tip on the bottom is different from all the other tips on the bottom. But it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s the same size and shape.</li>
    <li> Love the tools...they came super fast and are great quality!! GREAT PRICE!!! :) i will be ordering more items soon :) Thank you again!!</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are awesome! I just got the package and already busted them out to make flowers on my toe nails. You really can&#x27;t beat that price. The package arrived on the first day of the expected delivery time frame and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. They&#x27;re cute to look at and very functional! I would definately recommend these to anybody thinking about getting into nail art. They are awesome.</li>
    <li> Great quality and came quickly in the mail.</li>
    <li> So, in the picture you can clearly see the pens have different size endings. and I got 5 pens exactly alike. why would i want that??</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter is having a blast using this to enhance her nail creations.  The good part about the tools is that you can use them with any nail color, rather than the pens that only have one color in them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning the art of nail art but these tools really do help to make it easier to create salon quality art easily. Great price, quality, all fit my large hands well. Much better dotting than the toothpicks I was using. Shipping was pretty prompt considering the holidays. ( I ordered these around Christmas. Love the pretty pink swirls on them - all of mine are pink.</li>
    <li> When Ordering these, I thought the sizes would be different. When received all 5 are the same size. I guess the good thing-now I can split up the set and give as gifts.</li>
    <li> the dotting pens where all the same size not like in the image at all .... would not buy from again</li>
    <li> Bought this for someone and i was surprise that it came on time and it is exactly as how it is shown in the picture. I love the colors and design :)</li>
    <li> Not satisfied.  The 5 dotting tools, although multiple pretty colors, are all the same size.  If i had wanted just one size i would have ordered just one. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> When I recieved the small package I couldn&#x27;t believe that the dotting pen set was in there. It was unbelievable how small and how convenient they were. They work very well and they look amazing! Each pen has a different size and none of the pens have the same size. Very great for nail art.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I got these. I&#x27;ve been wanting to get the different sizes and I am so happy I found them at the great price I got them for!</li>
    <li> I absolutely looove these! They are so easy to use. These make dots perfect and you can do the simplest designs with these that look complicated! When I ordered these, they came weeks before they were supposed too! The dotting tools are so easy to use, and so cheap! THey have so many different sizes, I absolutely love them! Also, since they are steel, they are so easy to clean. These are a great buy!</li>
    <li> I love love love these! I did read the reviews and knew not to expect 10 different sizes with the 5 dotting tools. You get 6 different sizes since one side of all of them is the same. However, I am not the least bit disappointed. For the price, the quality is great and I use them all the time. My daughters have even gotten pretty good with them and have become very creative with their nails.</li>
    <li> Got my dotting pens after about 2 1/2 weeks, totally forgot about it so it&#x27;s was a great surprise . They are true to the picture and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! THESE DOTTING TOOLS. I saw them youtube a lot and when saw how cheap the were I though it was worth the risk of seeing if they were any good and they are great and easy to use. It is so  much fun to experiment with all the endless possibilities. Would give as a gift for a friend :)</li>
    <li> The one of the dotting pens broke the very first time we used it. definitely got what we paid for.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT I received very early very good i do thank you so much it really make my nails look very nice with all size of the dotting pens you can mix any dotting size on your fingernails there are so awesome to have .</li>
    <li> my daughter loves the dotting marbleizing dotting pen set. she can do designs on nails and she is happy with the set.</li>
    <li> I have wanted these for a long time and was excited to get them. They worked fabulously until the tip broke off of one of the tools the very first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Only one end of the dotting tools has graduated sizes.  The other ends are all the same with giganto size balls and the white one tool was broken - so it didn&#x27;t even have a size - that was annoying because it was the the size I actually needed.  I have used these for home manicures and it does the job, but it would have been better if were NOT broken and both sides were graduated sizes.  Not impressed, but not hating it...</li>
    <li> The dotting tools are very comfortable to use and am glad I ordered them. Am crazy for nail and this is helping me so much for different nail art ideas I have. The description of the product was true and the shipping was fast</li>
    <li> After waiting an extremely long time for these to arrive, I finally got a look at them and they are wonderful.  Just what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> So you do get 5 dotting tool. They&#x27;re double sided but the bottoms are exactly the same. The top are extra wide ,wide, medium,  extra medium, and small ,and all the bottoms are extra small  so just be aware that you&#x27;re only getting 5 one side that is cool</li>
    <li> The dotting tools work really we&#x27;ll,.. They were a bit smaller than I expected . The larger dotting tool is a little smaller than I thought but overall it works great .! The colors are really pretty and I recommend this product to anyone who is intrested on nail design</li>
    <li> it didnt come with 10different size of dots but it is useful and has different colors which is really pretty ..</li>
    <li> everything went smoothly, delivered on time if not early, items are es described and work great. would reccomend this to anyone, works just a well as more expensive options</li>
    <li> Im so very happy i bought this product from you. The nail tools are great and they got to my home faster than i thought. Also i feel that i got an awesome deal on them. Thank you for the great price and great item.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive like only a few dollars. Totally worth every penny. Despite coming from way over seas, it arrived in a short period of time. Probably one of the most cost effective purchases I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I loved this ! Arrived on time and I just love it ! I use this mostly every day in my nail technology class!</li>
    <li> For the price, these are a steal of a deal!  I embellished them with my own rhinestones for a little glam touch, and I use them all the time when I do nail art.  I even prefer to use them instead of nail art brushes sometimes because I feel I get more control over the design.  Wonderful purchase</li>
    <li> My sister loved them for a Christmas gift! She likes to do her nails so it worked out as a perfect gift.</li>
    <li> They had came earlier than expected but they all looked the same size but they worked beautifully. but the bad this is that they are glued on so they break easily and fast so i would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this item super fast.  The one thing the buyer needs to know is that the one end of the dot pens are all the same.  The other end ranges from large to small.  This shipper is very fast and items arrive with very good packing material.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good dotters, but they are all the same size.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured. Smaller than I expected, though</li>
    <li> Product was a little late due to weather condition but now that it&#x27;s here I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> Love this item. Makes cute, perfect designs. The package took over thirty days for it to arrive though. Makes it hard when the item is a gift. Other than that, perfect nail art pens!</li>
    <li> They work great and they were also super cheap, you can do so many different types of designs with them!</li>
    <li> I bought this item through Amazon via one of the third party sellers. Amazon only sells it as an add-on item for $6.43 (at the time of this review) whereas the third party seller had it for $0.60 with free shipping. I admit that the extremely low price made me wonder what condition it would be in when/if it showed up, but I was happy to receive an unbroken set with no loose metal ends. As other reviewers have noted, you won&#x27;t actually get 10 different sizes since some of the ends are the same. I used a pair of digital calipers (accurate to +/- 0.02mm) to check the diameter of each end. The set I received had the following sizes (in mm):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green: 3.00/1.56&lt;br /&gt;Blue: 2.58/1.57&lt;br /&gt;White: 2.28/1.56&lt;br /&gt;Orange: 1.54/1.57&lt;br /&gt;Pink: 1.06/1.53&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that there are really only 5 distinct sizes since the ends in the 1.53-1.57mm range are close enough that the difference is pretty much negligible and can probably be attributed to inconsistency in the measuring device or manufacturing process. While I would have liked to see 10 distinct sizes, the price was low enough that I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase and would go ahead and recommend it to others as long as they know that half of the ends are basically the same.</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e been looking for dotting tools everywhere, I finally found some! These are the best, no other stores sell them.</li>
    <li> working perfectly. very colorful.I love the dots I can make on my nails and in different sizes! I love this set of dotting tools and use them all the time.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any dotting pens for nail decorations at local stores.  For the price, these pens are great, and they work very well.  It has been fun decorating both my nails and my granddaugters&#x27; nails.</li>
    <li> Though one side is the same on mine, im so glad i bought mine for $1.97 included shipping. One of my tips came off buy nothing that crazy glue cant fix. I would tell anyone to buy this for yourself.. What a great deal! Buy them and buy extra, they would make great gifts for family and friends.</li>
    <li> U can mk ur nail look like u had them done at a salon we r looking forward to buying them again</li>
    <li> These are so awesome! Very easy to get used to using and so much fun to use! Definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received these in the mail but when I opened them the tip of the blue dotting tool was bent. It doesn&#x27;t show this in the picture so I&#x27;m wondering if I should send them back or if it is supposed to be bent. Did anyone else receive a bent tip on the blue tool?</li>
    <li> I love my dotting tools but most of them are the same size balls on each end.&lt;br /&gt;they took forever to come i for got that i had even had ordered  them</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools! I have never used dotting tools before, and these were so easy to use. I also love that they are double sided.</li>
    <li> I had no problems with this product. The 5 parts are different as are their double points. There are several that look alike but no, they are not. I really liked this herammienta.  buy it again with eyes closed</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS. it&#x27;s so easy you just put a splash of nail polish on a piece of paper or plastic, and you just dip your dotting tool in there and then poke your nail and done, you got a dot, i love making flowers on my nails with this. i over thought this at first. anyway, it looks like it wont dry but relax [literally] it will dry eventually.</li>
    <li> These are great and very pretty they come in great sizes bests one that I have found and they are cheap which is a big plus</li>
    <li> Arrived just in time for christmas! Nice quality- good variety set.  My daughter will have hours of fun doing her nail art... thank you.</li>
    <li> I ordered pink but I got blue colored dotting pens... I would be fine with it if one of the metal ends didn&#x27;t pop off on the first day of using it. The other ends are fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it! This product came in on time and works really well! She enjoys doing her nails now knowing the design will turn out better than doing it with a tooth pick or the actual brush. Good product :)</li>
    <li> Not so Great the tips have fallen out on all but 1</li>
    <li> Love them. I like doing my own nails, I&#x27;m not a professional and these are the perfect dotting tools for creating designs on my nails</li>
    <li> Was everything I had expected, they have allowed me to really get creative in my nail designs, so much fun.</li>
    <li> I started out with this and found out there are for more then making dot I use them for all kind of design</li>
    <li> I have been using these dotting tools for about 6 months now. I was very pleased with the product &amp; it helped me to achieve amazing nail art designs. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thank you! It comes with different colors. It is kind of hard to use this tool. Doesn&#x27;t really stick good.</li>
    <li> I got what I ordered.  You can make nice designs on nails, but not many different sizes to make but still ok.</li>
    <li> they got here fast, and theyre all different sizes theyre great! theyre also a great size. i couldnt ask for a better product</li>
    <li> Great item for designing nails. We&#x27;ve already used two different ones to make all kinds of cute designs on our nails. Each stick has a different size ball at the end of it allowing you to be creative on your artwork.</li>
    <li> All dotting tools were different sizes which was awesome. They are pretty tools as well. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product, and such a good price too! :)</li>
    <li> These are beautiful. I wish I&#x27;d purchased more. They are neat and come with several different sizes for any project.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools fulfill all the dotting needs I require. I just need this sentence to fill space up, don&#x27;t read.</li>
    <li> These are great, they arrived quickly, look just like I expected them to, and do just what they are supposed to do, though maybe I should try to order steadier hands...</li>
    <li> I thought that these were very cute and I really wanted to use them on my nails, so I decided to buy them. They are nice, but they break very easy :( One of mine is broken,and I don&#x27;t even know how it happened!! still, they are cute enough &amp; work enough to purchase them for such a cheap price!&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with the product itself.  I bought a set for myself and for a friend, of which she immediately went home and started playing with fun designs on her nails.  She has already done perfect flowers, daisies, lines &amp; squiggles.  I can&#x27;t wait to start playing with designs myself when I do my nails this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5, is due to how long the shipping took.  I ordered on Feb 15th and it didn&#x27;t arrive until March 10th.  23 days, when I&#x27;m used to 2 days and it was a birthday present that ended up being a month late.  It would have been worth it to me to find a seller that offered Prime 2 Day shipping and pay a couple dollars more in this instance, but if I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry, then no big deal.</li>
    <li> Poor Quality. I barely used them before they broke. The tips would either broke off or fell out and had then less than a month.</li>
    <li> Probably one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made ever. I use these tools every time I do my nails. I highly recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> Despite how long this took to receive, the quality is great &amp; I don&#x27;t know how I lived without these</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the different sizes for the dotting. I can make cherry blossoms, polka dots,  or mickey designs easily. The different size ends allow me to make large or small designs. Especially on my niece little nails.</li>
    <li> I use these dotting tools for a lot of things. Most times I use the smallest dotting tool to draw most of my designs out. Very useful and convenient, also fun colors!</li>
    <li> My daughters loved these and have enjoyed being able to make patterns in their nail polish so easily.</li>
    <li> The dotting pens work well, but as many other reviews stated I had pens that were the same size. 1 side of all 5 pens were the exact same size and two pens were duplicates. So in total instead of receiving 5 pens with 10 different dotting sizes, I received 5 pens with only 4 different dotting sizes.</li>
    <li> Mine came in Pink. They also shipped really fast. I really love this product, all sizes were there and they&#x27;re really good quality. I know you can use toothpicks and other DIY tools to get similar designs on your nails, but these are just easier to use and handle. I would recommend these nail art dotting tools</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product, however I was disappointed that I order what I though was blue and got a multi color pack instead.  I also ordered a pink pack and got another multi color pack..  I have two girls and was going to put them in their stocking for Christmas.  Now there is no way to tell them apart.  No real big deal.. Just color issue&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Shipping took a lot longer than expected.. I got two of the same pen and the metal part of one of them fell off as well.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I was able to put it back together.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still pretty happy with this product though, for the price it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them. I actually broke one, but I dont think that they&#x27;re easily broke, i was just using a lot of pressure when I was cleaning them, so just be careful with that. Other than that, they&#x27;re a great product and I would definitely by them again.</li>
    <li> All the dotting pens have the same sized dots.  The picture shows many different sized dots but mine were all the same.</li>
    <li> Probably the best thing I have purchased on amazon they work great just one side has different sizes the other has all the same size</li>
    <li> My feedback isn&#x27;t too good as I have not used these yet. I am waiting to polish my daughters nails with some fun designs</li>
    <li> I am new to nail art and these have been a huge help.  Anyone that has a little time on their hands can easily use these.  They are cost effective and worth the wait in shipping.  They are stylish and easy to work with.  I would recommend these to any aspiring or current nail artist.</li>
    <li> I do like these, the only issue that I have is yes, they come in different size BUT only on one side. In the image the ones along the top vary in size big to small, but the second tip on each dotter is the SAME size. So really you are getting 6 sizes, not 10.</li>
    <li> Different colors then shown. They took a long time to arrive and the metal tips separate from the plastic quite a lot.</li>
    <li> Was looking around for a dotting tool. And this one had the best price. I love them. Anyone can use these to make their nails look pretty.</li>
    <li> Getting 5 dotting tools for this price is great.  I like all the different sizes that some in the set.</li>
    <li> First of all it took along time to get to my house. They came from China. Second no instructions came with the pens and I had a hard time getting the color out.</li>
    <li> I love my nail art pins they are so great and fun to do your nails with you can do what you like to do and have fun with them all at the same time . Thank You !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used dotting tools before and these are fantastic.  They come in lots of different sizes and are very sturdy and pretty.</li>
    <li> I use this to paint my nails. Nice variety of dotting sizes for the cheap. Like this product a lot!</li>
    <li> The set has a variety of dotting sizes.  The tools are balanced and are easy to hold and manipulate.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a handful of times. You have to practice a little to be good at it, but that&#x27;s true for any tool. It works well and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This is a great set for decorating the nails. It makes it so much easier than trying to work with your fingers.</li>
    <li> These are great to work with when doing dots and adding designs to your nails. My favorite one is the slightly pointed (almost a teardrop shape) because it allows me to maneuver my polish into pretty swirls and scrolls. It&#x27;s a bit misleading in the picture because it makes it look like you get 10 different styles, but it&#x27;s really only 6 because you get the small same size end on one side of all of the tools and then a different size on the other end of each. I would still buy these if you&#x27;re looking for one because they are very versatile and useful.</li>
    <li> Only two stars because when I used one for the every first time and it was the pink it broke :(</li>
    <li> great product great price! this was shipped fro hk/china and i was not expecting too much out of this product, but this is a great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Do not know how to use it ,no instruction came with that ,these are of different color one ,but no color comes out of it.,I will not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> Product came in early.  Looks exactly like picture. Great price for all five of these.  Overall I give them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have used these several times now.  I have great results now that I am developing good technique.  look forward to using them in the future</li>
    <li> OMG i cant wait till it comes it there is only 4 days till its here :) i want to use it everything about my nails when i get better (i suck right now but my nails are about medium right now) i want it nowww lolz i will wright another review when it comes it bye :)</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m a nail art freak and I&#x27;ve been using bobby pins before buying this dotting tool. I regret not getting it earlier because they come in all sizes and are very helpful when doing my nails.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, my tool set has 5 different tips on one end, and 5 same sized tips on the other end.  They were rumored to take months to ship (based on other reviewers, friends, and other first hand accounts)  But despite the estimated shipping time of almost a month, they arrived two weeks before expected during the Holiday season even.  For paying only a couple bucks (price+shipping) I feel like I got what I wanted.  Even with the mistake in labeling/different sized tips, it&#x27;s worth it and was cheaper than buying at a beauty store.&lt;br /&gt;As far as use, they&#x27;re easy to use and clean, though I wish the thin metal parts were long enough to dip strait into my nail polish sometimes.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on my varied manicures and I&#x27;ve been enjoying practicing my designs.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this product. she is a teen that uses it every day. she does all kinds of nail art with it.</li>
    <li> I love these so much they got here quick and are very useful i would recommend these to ANYONE!They have a very nice size vereation</li>
    <li> I love to play with different nail art styles. These dotting pens will make it easier and fun to come up with new designs.  I was pleased with the price and fairly quick shipping.</li>
    <li> What a great buy...great overall and fantastic price. They arrives far quicker than I expected which was an added plus. A few sets for the girls in the house and a few extra for one studying cosmetology.</li>
    <li> This product is great only thing is that the end of each dotting tool are all the same size... i mean the price is great and thats its only MINOR flaw.</li>
    <li> it is kind of hard to do little designs with the dotting pen. even dots sometimes. the biggest size&#x27;s dot is still pretty small.</li>
    <li> The product came in different sizes only on one side, but so far I like them and would suggest them to anyone. They are small and compact, great for traveling, which I like. :D</li>
    <li> this product was ok when it was first shipped  one of the pieces was broken can be better made next time</li>
    <li> I got them as a gift and the price was great! I know my daughter will like them! There are a variety of sizes of tips for all types of nail art, they can even be used for craft projects!</li>
    <li> well... it said 4 piece set and when i got mine in the mail, i received only 3. a blue, yellow, and pink. i was excited to get them and i am happy but im not happy about the 3 piece and not 4. happy yet disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like these tools. They are easy to use and clean and work to make nice round dots for nail art. These tools don&#x27;t have 10 different size tips, though. The smaller size repeats on several end of the tools, so you probably only have 6 or 7 (I think) different size tips. It&#x27;s worth it though since they are cheap and seem well made.</li>
    <li> Wonderful tool set, it&#x27;s variety helps me achieve all the nail art I could hope for. Very nice tool set.</li>
    <li> I love the dotting tools! They make nail art easier to do. There is a variety of sizes included and the shipping was fast</li>
    <li> I used these all the time and I love them I am like a nail fanatic and these were cheap and did the job..</li>
    <li> I purchased this dotting pen set and it was exactly what I was expecting. I read other reviews after the fact, and saw that some people felt they got all the same size or a couple sizes. The ones I received if different from others are all one size on one side and then five different sizes on the other side. It is slightly hard to see the difference, but you can tell. Very Happy!!!!!</li>
    <li> Came in a timely matter.I love using my dotting tools.  They come in handy for many designs. Yes I love this purchase.</li>
    <li> Each dotting pen has two different sized tips instead of the same size on both ends like other brands out there.  Very easy to grip which makes it very easy to use.  Super durable and the design (clear with swirly) is very neat.  If you are in need of new dotting pens or are even just starting out doing nail art, THIS IS THE DOTTING PEN SET FOR YOU!  Very cheap and very fast shipping!  Every girl who does her own nails (even if only time to time) should have this set of pens!</li>
    <li> My 9 yr old loves it and thinks I&#x27;m the coolest mom ever for all the amazing things we can do to her nails!!</li>
    <li> Variation of dot sizes. Great buy especially for the price. I really recommend anyone who is looking to change up their nails a bit to buy this.</li>
    <li> I use this for nail art designs, and I love it. I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere else and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> When I saw the price of these sets, I bought several for the nail techs at the salon that I go to.  I like to give gifts for them during the holidays, so this will be a small part.  I&#x27;m sure they will love them.</li>
    <li> Cosmetology student must buy, sister in law enjoys this product and price. Already was helping with her practice on nails for future customers.</li>
    <li> To be honest I was thinking that maybe I was going to loose the money, this isnt the case. These are useful dotting pens, very easy to use and also I really like the design, they look like marbles :)</li>
    <li> Used once before tip came out.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but  i like the look and feel of them ...</li>
    <li> I love these. I use them all the time. Would repurchase them.</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are the best! took a little while for the shipping but totally worth the wait. I have done my nails three time since getting them</li>
    <li> The dotting tools are great! I can make so many designs on my nails, flowers, polka-dots, and more... Great product!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and they work well :-) impressed! Also arrived earlier than expected</li>
    <li> I really love this product!! It&#x27;s everything I wanted and was hoping for! I always see nail tutorials on YouTube, and the nail artists always use these tools while I was stuck using a toothpick or a hair pin; that wasn&#x27;t fun considering I couldn&#x27;t make different sized dots.. But these are amazing, and I&#x27;m sooo happy to have them! Shipping was also fast and easy! I recommend this to all the people who have the same struggle as I did !!</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t have a lot of different sizes and a lot are the same size dot. They do seem durable and well made though.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this.</li>
    <li> Bought as gift for my wife. She is happy with them.</li>
    <li> It really works to creat polka dot nail style with this pen set. Good tools for nail art but need to practice :) Love it by the way</li>
    <li> All I can say is that the package here soon them what they and in mint condition. Love the different size and they made very durable my little two year old dropped them and they didn&#x27;t break. All around five stars..</li>
    <li> Shipping took a long time, but still a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product, creates such beautiful design&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Works good for making dots. I have tried numerous times to make dots unsuccessfully with the nail polish brush. These work great for various size dots.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the products I received. I was expecting the handles to be the same color but other than that I like the dotters and am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I think these are pretty decent. They work like they are supposed too.&lt;br /&gt;Good for someone starting out I guess.</li>
    <li> They were just as I expected them to be. A bit late but still awesome product.. you know like what theyre supposed to be, dotting tools.</li>
    <li> One of my dotters was loose and came out on arrival.... packaging was shotty.  But it was nothing E6000 couldnt fix!  I have not used but one to test it out a bit, but not really worked with the.  However I see no reason they cant do the job.  Great buyx if you want toplay or use them with clients.  Each end is a different size, and each wand is a different color.  Cool beans...</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of nail tools.  Good variety in the sizes of the tips.  Took awhile to get here from China.</li>
    <li> not sure why I bought these, other then the great price... have yet to use them....  any suggestions?</li>
    <li> One came apart getting out of the package. The rest were great.</li>
    <li> Sizes were repeated and I&#x27;ve had 2 tips break off. The multiple sizes are fairly different and I&#x27;ve gotten use out of all of them</li>
    <li> These worked perfectly for nail designs.</li>
    <li> Excellent！This product is full of high quality. It is a better choice to select the similar products from this seller.</li>
    <li> Tricky to use at first but I love that there are so many different sizes and for a great price! Really happy with the product and price!</li>
    <li> This price made me give the set a try....I bought it for my daughter who is 15 and does her nails almost daily!  She loves it and makes the most amazing designs with it!  Ideas easily found on-line!</li>
    <li> ok for price, nothing of any real quality here, good for 6 year old doing her and her daddys nails, have a tip or 2 that have come out, just push back in, is all good.</li>
    <li> I love this product it is very nice and looks like will last. Dotters range from size and are easy to hold. Differently recommend purchasing if you are into nail art :)</li>
    <li> the set is double pointed but only 6 different sizes in total.  one side is a range of &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; from super small to large, and the other ends are all the same size. so you can do 2 different dot sizes with one tool for speed.</li>
    <li> The product was amazing and it makes perfect circles! I use the dotting tool to make cool designs like mixing in different polka dots together and it came out really pretty!</li>
    <li> Very cool product!  I can hardly wait to do my nails and my daughters nails with her friends. As teens, they will love these tools.</li>
    <li> I love this dotting yool. It is exactly what I wanted! this product is affortable and does the job. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love them!! My manicure has never looked better. They were so easy to use. I would recommend them to my friends.</li>
    <li> I love the dotting tools. Its much easier to do dots or hearts and flowers. I ordered two sets. One for me and one as a gift.</li>
    <li> Can use these for modeling clay, painting tiny details or on nails for detail work. Cute tools at a good price</li>
    <li> So glad I ordered these. They are an amazing value.  I also use them for craft painting as well as my nails.  I&#x27;m a nail polish fanatic and these are awesome tools.</li>
    <li> The only problem I have with this is that two of the sticks have one end that are the same size. Though this doesn&#x27;t really mater since there are already plenty of sizes on these.</li>
    <li> I ordered these via a suggestion on a YouTube nail art tutorial. I was very pleased with the price of my products, and more so the value! I also, really liked how quickly my dotting tools arrived! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for easy, inexpensive, professional nails!</li>
    <li> excellent product, loves that comes in different sizes and really cheap. it helps nail art a lot and makes making designs easier and faster instead of making your own tools</li>
    <li> I used to use a bobby pin and the back of sewing pins to get my dots right... Never again!  Happy day!</li>
    <li> I have already done so many things with these.  They are one of my best purchases! I am in love with these tools!</li>
    <li> I ordered the pink set but really wanted the colorful set. I was on a tight budget and when my order arrived it was the colorful set. I was more happier with the product I recieved than what I ordered!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these pen much but when I do, they work well and their good quality. I do have to dip them well enough for each dot otherwise they&#x27;re great. The price is awesome, you have to wait bit long to receive it since it&#x27;s shipped from overseas. I would recommend these to someone who enjoys doing nail art.</li>
    <li> The tips occasionally fall off.</li>
    <li> This helps to do so many different designed on nails. If ut in to doing nails then you should get some dotters. This item came before shipping date. Would use seller again for sure.</li>
    <li> Good product, especially for the price and quality.  Mine arrived about 2.5 weeks after I ordered them.  It&#x27;s true, there are only 5 different sizes since the opposite ends are all the same size.  But then again, how many difference sized circles do you need?  5 is more than enough.  I use one side to make designs, and the opposite ends to grab the rhinestones.</li>
    <li> My girls seemed to like this set.  One of the tips broke off after only one use.  For the price, I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> They work great, everything is in excellent condition. Great price, and they are even cuter and smaller than I expected!</li>
    <li> My wife and daughters use them all the time.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s gơod, but tơo many small size&lt;br /&gt;It came faster than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;Have not tried it yet but the colors are pretty.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Dots come out perfect if i use the right amount of nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;I am still practicing, but I like it so far.</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery, Great product. For the price I thought it was going to be a cheap material but is it really good.</li>
    <li> love the colors and they work very well. so many ways to use them. the colors are bright also thanks</li>
    <li> These are great.  Very easy to use.  Don&#x27;t seem cheap at all; you get a good product for the price.  Not much more to say about it.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This was definitely worth the $5 shipping!! I&#x27;ve done so many designs and creations on my and my daughters nails! Super fun to use. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I was iffy about buying these because it seemed completely unnecessary and there are tutorials everywhere for using pin heads and bobby pins and so on.  I was never too impressed with any of the alternatives, and for $2.15, I eventually figured I&#x27;d give them a try. They&#x27;re AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting perfect little dots of polish every time.</li>
    <li> They are just the right size Try these for  yourself, you will  not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these nail dotting tools. They are so easy to use and are super cute. A must have for the do it yourselfers.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this Product to anyone who loves nail art as much as I do. I loved how efficient the shipping was.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are great.  Different sizes.  Although one has a slight imperfection at the base of the handle they are still in great condition, bright colors and I will be ordering more to add to my collection.</li>
    <li> Great little tools in a great pouch.  Make big dots, little dots, draw lines, clean up cuticles, apply decals, these work great!</li>
    <li> I do many polka dots on my acrylic nails and my toes, I really love them and much easier than a tooth pick!</li>
    <li> I love these!  It&#x27;s amazing what you can do with your nails with these!  And, I got them fairly quick.  Said they would be here August 21-Sept 9th...I got them the week of August 7th so I&#x27;m pretty impressed!</li>
    <li> i very much enjoyed these products they have helped me create multiple designs even though i just got them last week i love using them. Just a heads up the do not come in the plastic casing shown in one of the pictures but i am fine with that. The only problem i had was that today while using the pink one i was holding it using one side without even touching the top when the top dotter just fell off. I&#x27;m sure this wasn&#x27;t a problem with the product it probably just got banged around during shipping or maybe i did something wrong i don&#x27;t know. I will say as far as i see it this was a good product even though shipping was longer than anticipated it can do the job as good as anything else.</li>
    <li> The dotting tool arrive earlier than the estimate but the tips only have 5 tips te other side was the same it look exactly like the last pic!</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;ordered&amp;#34; the all pink ones but when i got them they were the rainbow ones... It didn&#x27;t matter what color they were for me cause they all work the same but it&#x27;s whatever so totally worth the buy. Anyone whose thinking of getting these, do it i was looking for some for the longest time and the only ones i found were $25 even with my cos. discount. So when i saw these i was like $.11 and like $1.00 for shipping for sure...</li>
    <li> This product took 3 months to come to my house. Although, once I finally got it, the colors I ordered were not the same ones I got. The knew that I got were the expensive ones that cost $6 and are multicolored. At least they messed up and gave me a product with better colors, but it was not worth 3 months of a wait. And for the people that say the sizes were the same on the dots, they are completely different, so do not bring that up</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and every size tip you could need and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Lots of sizes of dots to choose from. So much easier than what I was doing. Shipping was not too bad</li>
    <li> Great Price! Very Functional! Arrived Quickly! What else would you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware when you are buying this that on all five tools one side is the same size on all of them. Its the other end that varies between the tool. But you cannot beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> They do what they say.  Like everyone else said, there are not 10 different sizes there are 5, (one side is all the same sizes for each), but you can only have so many sizes of polka dots to begin with.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture.. On one side all of the dotting sizes are the same for every piece and on the other side they vary from smallest to biggest.. This product is Very easy to use</li>
    <li> I like these they come in different sizes and are easy to use. Will order again if I need them again.</li>
    <li> When I got them,I first of all loved the colors&amp;design! When I used them(straight away:)I couldn&#x27;t figure out how I&#x27;d lived without them! If ur used to any other tool,ur gonna love these perfect dots of all sizes! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I use to struggle to make dots on my nail designs, but now it&#x27;s a lot whole easier to do. Love it love it!!</li>
    <li> These look just as pictured. They are perfect for nail art and feel like they are made from high quality materials. I&#x27;ve been using these for two months and they are easy to clean and show no signs of wear and tear.</li>
    <li> You get whats pictured. two of mine were exactly the same and the rest were all different. They work well and are easy to use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could use this but once I try to do all those designes I realized how usefull this tools are, it&#x27;s so easy to make fun designes now</li>
    <li> This one of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made. I love these nail dotting tools so much and I&#x27;m so glad I got these. I recommend!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get my dotting tools . !&lt;br /&gt;I need it when is it gonna be here ? Huh .</li>
    <li> I bought these to start doing my own nail art and they have come in handy for most of my designs. A definite must have.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for contacting me and settling this problem. You were extremely nice and east to work with. I will definitely do business with you again!!!! Excellent!!! My thank you again!!</li>
    <li> Best deal ever. Came fast and work great</li>
    <li> These tools are great and easy to use. You can do much more than make polka dots with them. Gone are the days of toothpick nail art! :)</li>
    <li> I LOVED THIS! Its cheap and affordable! Plus I always do my nails and this really helped me paint cool designs- especially polka dots, flowers, and strips. These tools are easy to clean after for later use! And I was a little worried about the price... what if it breaks easily? BUT IT IS TOTALLY DURABLE! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SOO MUCH!!!! I HIGHLY recommend and I am sure that I will buy more soon!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I was very pleased with the product and the service received. I ordered two; one for my sister as a surprise gift and one for myself. I was happy with the quality of the product. I would definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> For the price these are amazing... But I wish I would have listened to the other reviews and chose a different set. I only got 5 different sizes instead of the 10 advertised. Only one side of the tools are different the rest are the same size.</li>
    <li> All of them have one of their tip in common. Pretty good use. Great for dots, ideal for beginners to professionals!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter used these on my nail and they looked great, cheaper than paying a salon to do them. The more you use them the better you get at it.</li>
    <li> these are a nice compliment to any design on your nails and toes.  I would recommend this to a friend to give to her children.</li>
    <li> These are the PRETTIEST marblers I have in my collection!!! My clients even notice them!!! And they work GREAT...love the detail I can accomplish with them...</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got these in the mail. There are different sizes for different uses. And the price was great! They did take awhile to get here, but it was coming from China, so it&#x27;s understandable. Don&#x27;t waste your money &amp; buy from a regular store like Ulta or Sally&#x27;s. These are inexpensive &amp; do the same job!</li>
    <li> Love these tools. There are 5 tools with 2 different ends, just as described, but every tool has one end that&#x27;s the same as all the others. I wouldn&#x27;t let that dissuade you though. Six sizes are plenty for most people, and having the same size ends allows for you to switch between tools without having to clean off the other you were using if you want to use a different color.&lt;br /&gt;The tools themselves seem pretty sturdy. They were a little shorter than I expected, (I was expecting no. 2 pencil length), but the fit quite nicely in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they&#x27;re great and they came 12 days before the expected delivery date. And I don&#x27;t think I have to mention that these can be used for more than making just a plain polka dot. They&#x27;re also very useful for doing various designs that you need a fine tip for.</li>
    <li> I hate that they all fall apart days after receiving them! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all. But you get what you pay for....</li>
    <li> Great price and I can&#x27;t find anything to complain about! I&#x27;m not very rough with manicure tools but these seem pretty sturdy. They also come in a convenient clear carry pack. No complaints here!</li>
    <li> Well worth the cost, which, btw, is minimal.  They do the intended job and look nice as a bonus.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> These these dotting pens are great for my at-home manicures and pedicures (I never go to a salon). They&#x27;re great quality for such a low price!</li>
    <li> I love it. It makes the nail art that I do a whole lot easier. I am totally satisfied.Thank you</li>
    <li> We have six daughters and nails are painted almost daily around here. Perfect choice. I just wish I could figure out how to be creative.</li>
    <li> Makes nail decorating super easy. Love the design, super cute and definately recommend for someone who wants to decorate their own nails (and save a load of money!).</li>
    <li> I have been seeking out for these nail dotting pens for quite some time and when I spot them here on amazon I made sure to grab them at this steal of a deal. I started doing my own nail to save myself the extra money and began to build my very own \\&quot;at home nail salon\\&quot;. These dotting tool are a must have is nail art. The items are exactly as advertised and will fit in well as a addition to any first \\&quot;do it yourselvers\\&quot; out there. Good product and shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Work great, and I use them a lot, but some of them were the same size, so I didn&#x27;t get 10 different sizes. I maybe only have four or five different sizes.</li>
    <li> Packaging was sub-par on this item.  The dotting tools were poking out of the edge of the bubble envelope.  One tool was damaged--the tip came out of one end but was intact on the other end.  A nice little set.</li>
    <li> I got it yesterday and I got to use it for my nails. I love it I did all type of design.</li>
    <li> I absoutely love my dotting tools!!! I use them all the time (create dots, flowers,hearts, use it to pick up stones and soo much) Whenever, I do a manicure for a customer they always say how pretty the tools are and love the marble effect. It was a GREAT BUY</li>
    <li> Got these and started playing with my nail polishes imediately. I have never owned any nail art tools and have never really used any. Yes all the points on one side of the tools are the same but the difference of size on the other sies are fine. Great Deal!</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast shipping and the tools worked great. I used these tools to make polka dots on my nails and they made them perfectly.</li>
    <li> These dotting pen are awesome they come in 8 different sizes and are really easy to use, my daughter even uses them.</li>
    <li> Well,  my daughter was upset bc the dotting tools suppose to of been all Pink, since we bought other dotting tools with other different colors. She was hoping for these to be all pink. So, when her dotting tools came in she was a little upset , but, it&#x27;s all good. She&#x27;s happy now!! She&#x27;s painted my nails and put all kinds of designs. So, we are very happy!</li>
    <li> For minimal cost, we can do the design on our nails. The tool is good quality! It&#x27;s like having a nail salon at home!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Each end has different sizes, from very tiny to very large. They make nail art SO simple! I am very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> I got these tools to assist with the nail designs that I wanted to achieve. The only problem is that the &#x27;neck&#x27; part of the tool is thicker than the neck of the nail polish. So it can be difficult to get nail polish on the product, I end up having to tip the polish to get the color on the dotting tool.</li>
    <li> They are all in a package as described in the picture. They are all the same size though and I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> have not used these yet, but they are pretty basic nail decorating tools - different size heads... exactly what they look like.</li>
    <li> Love these! They are really cute for flower designs</li>
    <li> i love these things. This is the second pair that i&#x27;ve bought and i still love them. The first pair was the different color ones and the second pair are the all pink ones. Both are cute.</li>
    <li> satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when i got mine in the mail. unike the others on here mine did come with all the right sizes so i was a bit scared at first but i went a head and ordered anyway because whats only 1.67 so worth it love doing my nails and came way before the date it was exposed to thanks amazon a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> These pens are easy to use, very durable and versatile in their sizes. I&#x27;m surprised how many more patterns I can come up with using these than just polka dots. They function as a brush in their own way, and you&#x27;re able to make flowers, stripes, swooshes, smiley faces, characters, and just about anything. You need a bit of a steady hand if you&#x27;re working on yourself, especially with your non-dominant hand, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the tools themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need or use these often enough to warrant purchasing them in a store, but I saw this price and couldn&#x27;t resist. They&#x27;re a staple in my nail art collection, and I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. Definitely worth it, and would make such a neat, surprise gift.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! I love all the different sizes. You can make so many different designs with these. Love them!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter since she likes to use nail polish.  She likes them and I will probably use them in the future as well.</li>
    <li> I love this set.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and so easy to use.  I find I use them for a lot more art than just my nails</li>
    <li> I love the fun colors of this dotting pens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they come in different sizes of dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nice material, and size of pens</li>
    <li> The pen set is great; it comes with a nice variety in sizes. The only thing that was disappointing is that on one of the pens the dotters fell out. I glued it back in and it was fine. I just didn&#x27;t expect it to come that way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product as I&#x27;m an artist and these dotting tools helped me tremendously in my painting!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and easy to clean. They&#x27;re great fun. I&#x27;ve bought a few more to give my friends. And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for making the flowers on your nails like the people do at the nail salon, just as long as you know what your doing! I Love These for my nails, and they are not over priced! Perfection......</li>
    <li> It take to long for the shipment to come. Price is ok. But if you can wait then this is a buy for you.</li>
    <li> These help me to put decals on  my nails and make my nails look professionally done. I love playing with the different pens.</li>
    <li> Its very nice product and good quality. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Good quality for the price. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Love my dotting tools it works great especially doing dots it easy to hold and handle and work with it comes in a package in a little case that you can keep them in and its very easy to wash them off after you get done!</li>
    <li> You can use these for really great designs and its quick!  I like to use them when I&#x27;m short on time for easy yet pretty nails!</li>
    <li> Great quality and amazing price....my wife loves the set. Comparable to retail items at a fraction of the cost...buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> I am an oil/acrylic painter, and I use these to make dots or other marks on my paintings!  Better than using the wrong end of the paint brush. It was a great &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; purchase.</li>
    <li> Did not last long at all. They break very easily and are way too fragile.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for new tools for doing manicures and this set is perfect!  Also for a great price!</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO. MANY SIZES FOR YOUR MONEY. MY NEIGHBOR TEEN LOVES IT ON HER NAILS.  DOES A GOOD JOB</li>
    <li> Wonderfully and priced and it is what I ordered price was very expansive dose great dots easy to clean thank you</li>
    <li> I love these, I use them for my manicures all the time, they are also really cool to look at when you spin them in between your fingers.</li>
    <li> These are great dotting tools and they have lasted me so long that I would never buy any other kind but these. They also clean very well and are very inexpensive</li>
    <li> These are so useful! I have used them for several different types of nail designs. They are definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> These were cheap to get, but you get what you pay for. They do the work, but the ends fall off easily. A couple of mine when I got them were already loose.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping love it that.</li>
    <li> I love that there are many sizes on these dotting tools to create countless designs on nails or any surface that will take nail polish. The shipping was fast and arrived safely wrapped.</li>
    <li> I love it. its amazing the variety of different colors and style.&lt;br /&gt;The minute i got it, i started to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Im happy and was worth buying it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used these or anything like them before so I&#x27;ve been practicing with them. I did use them to do my daughters nails and she loved the different designs.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools have worked wonderfully! We use them for painting and crafts! they are super fun! I also plan to use these for artwork on my nails when I get around to doing them! Great price! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I love how the tool looks like but I had to wait quite a while for the product. I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s because I live far away.</li>
    <li> They arrived in perfect condition. I was worried because other reviews said there were duplicates but the end of each one I received is a different size. Would order again.</li>
    <li> Brand new great quality for what i paid. Exactly what i wanted and it is exactly what i expected.great job</li>
    <li> These took forever to get here because I think they shipped from China... But they are so fun to use! And definitely worth the price! If you&#x27;re not willing to wait about a month for them you can always get them from Sally&#x27;s for $10-$15.</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are great.  Each side has a different size and it gives you good variety for your designs.  These are really useful.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these! I use them almost all of the time. Got exactly what I paid for: the pink ones and 10 different dotting sizes. I&#x27;ve had them for about 3 months now and they&#x27;re still great. Nothing broken, nothing chipped. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because they arrived about 2 weeks after the estimated arrival date. Other than that, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product :)</li>
    <li> Had been going to school for nail technology and these were a gift for that, they where amazing and exactly what I needed for class. (Yes I now have my licence!)</li>
    <li> I love them.&lt;br /&gt;Putting dots in my nails has never been so easy</li>
    <li> They are adorable and work really well I love them to death!!</li>
    <li> It says ten sizes but you get six. Not a real big deal to me because it works just fine and the six sizes are all you really need.</li>
    <li> I love using these marbelizing dotting pens to make polka dots on my nails! They make it easy to create cute nail designs.</li>
    <li> These came in the mail before the expected date, so thumbs up already on the shipping. They came in a nice clear bag- good for storage. They all seemed good and I&#x27;m pretty sure the dot sizes are different on each. Just not on the other end of the one pen. I think these will come in handy for the future when I want to design my nails a specific way for a party or when I go out to the mall with my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for these. They came way before they were supposed to and I am glad they did. There was a nice little note with the packaging.  I can not wait to dot my nails all over.</li>
    <li> do what i need to with my nails and good for other stuff to .very good super happy with they.</li>
    <li> exactly what the picture shows. although one was missing an end but i dont need that many sizes i really only needed 2 but this was cheap.</li>
    <li> For the price, this tools are amazing! But also because of the price the are kind of cheap packaged. I had to hot glue a couple of parts back together, but overall they are fantastic :-)</li>
    <li> They are perfect for doing your nails. You can do polka dots or cheetah print and it looks so cute. You def need to get them</li>
    <li> I love it!! It&#x27;s a little hard to get used to but once u get it figure out its super easy!!!!</li>
    <li> These dotting sets retail for $10 at my local beauty supply.  I paid a fraction of the price for the exact same thing!  Takes awhile to arrive, but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> work great! they do a amazing dots! Ilove this! Cheap and works great. I would get this if I were you!</li>
    <li> I would have given it a 5 BUT my product was a different color from the pink ones. It so didn&#x27;t go with the collection I had with the pink.  DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE DOTTING TOOLS. THERE ARE DIFFERENT SIZES PLUS THE COLORS ARE CUTE. I USE THE COLOR OF THE TOOLS TO MEMORIZE WHAT SIZE OF THE DOT IM TRYING TO MAKE. IN THE END, IT DOES ITS JOB.</li>
    <li> Came fast and better quality then I thought they would be!  I love how easy they clean off with nail polish remover.  I also love how creative you can get with the different size dots you can do.</li>
    <li> The dotting tool I received are all different size even though like 2 out of the 5 seem so alike but they are different. What I did not like was that I ordered them for all of them to be pink but instead received one pink, white, blue, green, and yellow. But the price was unbeatable got them for 13cents, well can not complain.</li>
    <li> My daughters love these for their nail art!  Was skeptical because they were so inexpensive but they work great!&lt;br /&gt;Item was delivered quickly!</li>
    <li> these are very inexpensive and there&#x27;s a reason for that.  The metal tips are constantly coming out of the plastic handles and I have to glue them back in.  As far as nail art, it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Pretty darn good product for what I paid for. Overall good. Not 5 starts because there is room for improvement and they end up falling apart after some time (months).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my marbleizing dotting pens for about 6 months now, and they are still in excellent condition.  They&#x27;re made of metal and plastic and have held up quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the tips are a different size on each pen also.  You get a lot of choices here for the small amount of money they charge for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping takes about two weeks for these, but I didn&#x27;t mind waiting.  They arrived in excellent condition, so no worries there.</li>
    <li> These tools are easy to use and work great although there were no instructions or samples to go by.  I had to go online for that but they do work nicely.</li>
    <li> This is a cute little set with all different sizes for dotting. Easy to clean. Inexpensive, good buy. . .</li>
    <li> Priced just right,  Color are perfect - product is of good quality. It was packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;My grand daughter was very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I am very excited to be able to use these, the dotters are a wide variety of sizes. I have been trying to use things I have around the house, but they just don&#x27;t compare. These make very symmetrical sizes, and at the price, well worth it. I was very surprised to receive them earlier then expected, and got right to creating. I recommend this product for anyone that does nail art, professionally or for personal.</li>
    <li> When I got the product everything was in tact, but when using it the silver part came out. It&#x27;s nothing that some glue won&#x27;t handle. For the price you really can&#x27;t complain overall it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
    <li> Variety in sizes is perfect for nail designs. Sturdy construction. My tools came in multiple colors vs all pink but not a big deal. Shipping was quicker than expected considering it shipped from China. Comes in a handy pouch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who loves to experiment with nail art and different designs but hate spending a ton of money on it. I&#x27;m also not the biggest fan of nail salons. That is why I love this product so much. It&#x27;s quite versatile and user friendly, especially since I didn&#x27;t have any experience doing my own nail art like this until I first used this product. There&#x27;s a bunch of different sizes to try out and play around with different ideas from the comfort of your home. You really can&#x27;t beat this product for affordability, quality, and versatility.</li>
    <li> these dotting tools are awesome! they are double sided and one end will have the gradation size where it might be bigger or smaller, and the other side will have a really fine tip for details. they are really cute and super useful for doing nail art!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I need as many different dot sizes as this set comes with, but there sure is a variety. I gave another set to my friend, and we both use them frequently. They arrived early, which is always good.</li>
    <li> The tools them selves are wonderful for the designs.&lt;br /&gt;But the tools are smaller then I thought they would be and I got 2 of the same tools with the same size dotter. Also, expected bigger sized dots they they are also. 1 is big the rest are very tiny..&lt;br /&gt;But for 2 bucks it&#x27;s expected.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my little sister, and she loved them. Really nice to play with</li>
    <li> Nice points and can easily be used for other things . I use them for setting rhinestones in jewelry making.</li>
    <li> These are really nice gifts for your nail polish guru.  They are pretty and pack well into any nail station.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use and came with no defects. how can you complain with the amazing price? love them!</li>
    <li> For durability, shipment, price, results of nail art, I rate it all a five. I will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with these dotters. They work well for tiny little designs as well as a leopard design. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;Makes nail art fun!&lt;br /&gt;What more can you ask for? I love the designs I&#x27;m able to create with these.</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are perfect!  Now I don&#x27;t have to spend $40 on a pedicure, when I can create designs on my toes for free.  Great items!</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are very cheap and a great investment because they come in different sizes and they are small. The didn&#x27;t take much time to arrive. I recommend you to buy these. I watch a lot of nail youtube videos and now I can recreate the nail art with these dotting tools!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice and well-made product.  I Can&#x27;t wait to try them out.  The products Shipped and arrived as described.  I even bought 2 so one could be gifted!</li>
    <li> My daughter likes to experiment and these are great.  they are easy to use too.  This will help her learn without spending a llot of money.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and ordered this. Shipping took a while but what is the hurry if you want to do nails! Packaging was good and the dotting pen set works good too. Just that you get only 5 different sizes of dots and not 10. But it costs less than $1.50 including shipping. So overall a good purchase!</li>
    <li> About 7 different sizes in all... &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; are 5 different sizes and the &amp;#34;bottom &amp;#34; are 2 different sizes. I thought I&#x27;d be getting 10 different sizes but still an awesome product. I definitely recommend them they are easy to use and sturdy</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools! they make my manicure look cute! :) &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> first off.... i ordered these expecting there to be 10 different sizes.... but now im reading in the reviews that there are some the same size.... i have been waiting and waiting, but i still havnt seen them, and its passed the ETA. (estimated time of arrival)</li>
    <li> This item hasn&#x27;t reached us yet. We ordered over a month ago and continue to wait, hoping it didn&#x27;t fall out of the plane over the ocean.</li>
    <li> These do not have 10 different sizes of dots. There are two tools that are duplicates. I really wanted a larger dotting size than what I got, that&#x27;s why I ordered a set with &amp;#34;10 different sizes&amp;#34; as advertised. I am disappointed with this purchase but since it only cost $2 its hard to get too upset over it. Just a waste of my time, waiting on it to get here and then seeing that 2 tools are duplicated and they&#x27;re all small sizes ....was very disappointing. It didn&#x27;t come with a pouch either.  Only have it 2 starts instead of one because it did arrive a week early.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a nail artist by any means, but these are not useful to work with.  The paint did not stay on the tip well to apply to the nail.</li>
    <li> I would recommend these dotting tools to anyone who is a nail art enthusiast or crafter. There are several different sized dotters. And the price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This item worked wonderfully for me. I have seen similar products used in my local nail salons and I was in search of something similar to use on myself when I do my own nails at home. I cant be more satisfied with my purchase. I have had them a while now and they are very durable. They have lasted through countless uses as well as the acetone that I use on it regularly to clean off any left behind polish. Other brushes that I have used in the past have not been able to withstand this wear and tear long!! I would recommend this product to anyone who loves to make their nails look beautiful and are looking for accessories to assist them in doing so.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are wonderful for creating any design on your nails. Why stop there? You can use these for anything, they are lightweight, beautifully colored, and come in different size points. The small points are great for making those teeny tiny circles. Just love them! Highly recommend these dotting tools. Amazon shipped them very quickly, almost the next say they were on my doorstep.</li>
    <li> This set are all small dotters - rainbow set you&#x27;ll find on Amazon are a bit larger.  I got both and I&#x27;m glad I did.  So far, they appear to be good quality and they come in a little clear case that you can keep them in.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THEM THEY WORK GREAT I USE THEM ALLL THE TIME AND THERE VERY COOL I ALWAYS WANT SOME AND GLAD THAT I GOT THEM FROM HERE</li>
    <li> pretty and they work pretty good. Big variety of sizes for all kinds of different designs and stuff like that</li>
    <li> these makes nails designing so much easier. Cute colors and different sizes. i use mine all the time ! !</li>
    <li> I bought these as a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter.  She loved them.  Thought they were really cool.  She loved the design and the colors.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this purchase! I received my product extremely quick (I only had to wait a day or two to receive it!) and the price was great!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re doubtful about buying this because of the bad reviews, DON&#x27;T MIND THAT. There are different sized dots to do any nail design !! :) And they&#x27;re really easy to use !</li>
    <li> I LOVE these dotting tools and they are the perfect size for any thing you could want to do. I would say no nail collection is complete without this set.</li>
    <li> I got the all pink (which were cheaper) and I got a variety of colors which makes me happy because I&#x27;m not a huge pink can. The top dots are all different sizes but the bottom ones are the same. So there are 6 sizes VS 10, but I got more than I bargained for.</li>
    <li> I like the different sizes of the dotting tool but some of the tips did come off. I just used super glue to put them back on and they work fine. if u like bargains like me then these are worth the price.</li>
    <li> I oreder these for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and her and her friends used them right away and they worked perfectly. they love it! thank you</li>
    <li> I got these two weeks before the estimated delivery! They are perfect. People are complaining about the tips but you can clearly see in the picture that all the ends are the same on one side. I got five different ones no doubles. The price was great and coming from China I got them very fast.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product, they were just what I were hoping they would be. Glad I purchased these. They&#x27;re great for creating perfectly round dots for nail art design.</li>
    <li> I love my dotting tools. I have been waiting so long to get one and i finally bought one. Now i can do my nails perfect. :)</li>
    <li> nice too even though it arrive late i still liked it very easy to use and clean worth waiting i definitely recommended</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected but there fun to use, hard to write letter with because if the ball on the end.</li>
    <li> I used these tools for the first time this past weekend &amp; they are AMAZING!!!  So easy to use &amp; it makes nail art/designs so simple!  I will thoroughly enjoy having these tools within my supplies.</li>
    <li> My order arrived om the first expected date. That&#x27;s the good part. The pens, although made out of glass, are very durable but one of the tips from the pink one would slip out if hold the pen without any support to the tips. one of the other pens tips were kinda loose too, but it would stay in if i just let it be there without any support. Pretty disappointed with the pink pen, but overall satisfied...</li>
    <li> Does its job and it was very cheap. I was happy with the price, Would like one of the dotters to be bigger but its cool.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and at a very cheap price! They even came in a cute little holder. Arrived on the first day of expected delivery. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I love nail art! this was just what I needed to make circles and dots. I also like the marbelized detail and the little puch that they came in. It took forever to get here but when they did I was completely satisfied with them!</li>
    <li> Bought these but dont really know what they are lol...gonna go in my sisters stocking, hope she knows what they are used for lol</li>
    <li> I received the wrong dotting tools . But they work the same , so doesn&#x27;t matter . I would recommend</li>
    <li> I really like these each has a different size at both ends . Making it easier to design beautiful nails. My only complaint was they come unscrewed.</li>
    <li> Came damaged, but was able to glue dotting parts back in plastic pieces and able to use them to do my nails.</li>
    <li> They are amazing i had my eye on them for a while now and they are just what i had hoped for not expensive, do a good job, and have a cute design to boot!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be all different sizes.</li>
    <li> These are the best dotting tools ive used so far! Very well priced, fast shipping, good quality. I had originally thought they came multicolored and didnt really like that but when i got them and seen they were all pink i was extremely happy. they fit perfectly in my nail art box compartments so it makes it easy to take everything on the go with me. They are way way way better then me trying to use a toothpick to do my designs!</li>
    <li> Awesome, my daughter uses these ever week, changing out her nails. She uses them to make all kinds of designs and faces.</li>
    <li> Very nice product lot of creative nail arts we can do with it&lt;br /&gt;very good quality and we recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller is nice also bit slow shipping but overall i am happy</li>
    <li> Love the different tip sizes</li>
    <li> I tried them as soon as they arrived and I love them! Nice tools I was able to do the designs I&#x27;ve been wanting too.</li>
    <li> I really like what I can do on my nails!  I get compliments all the time.  You don&#x27;t get a variety of tip sizes, but I&#x27;m happy with it and I definitely like the price.  They are easy to use, and you can get a good grip on them so you have a lot of control over making your designs.  My sister doesn&#x27;t have the steadiest hands, but she is able to work with them and get nice designs on her nails.  If you&#x27;re an amateur at nail design these will work well for you.  The only problem I ran into is that I am constantly doing my nails now, and changing the design.  Might not seem like a bad thing (it&#x27;s A LOT of fun), but I&#x27;ve found my nails were getting dry and brittle from constantly removing polish and reapplying.  If you have this problem with your nails, I found a skin care product that turns out to be excellent for my nails.  [[ASIN:B007VEPVZC Bel Essence - (2oz) 100% All-Natural, Organic Anti-Wrinkle Oil Treatment with Argan, Grapeseed and Avocado Oil]] - After I take off the nail polish, I put the oils on my nails and let it be absorbed.  It has made a huge difference in my nails after a couple of weeks, (and my hands too!)  I don&#x27;t worry so much any more about redoing my nail polish frequently.</li>
    <li> This product was not user friendly. This product does not last and was not able to open without breaking the container.</li>
    <li> okay so i know some people have been complaining that all dotting tools have one side that is the same as the others ,which is true . Being that i just want it to make dots im satisfied as it is</li>
    <li> Great!!!cheap and great!!thanks!def 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> love the bright colors and that they are easy to use. the spirals inside are really cute and am happy i got these dotting tools then a plain color.</li>
    <li> These tools are awesome. I am no professional at nail art but used these as soon as I got them. You can do so much with this!</li>
    <li> The product is great!...I like it. I&#x27;m very happy because I&#x27;m practicing my manicure with beautiful dots and another design in my nails.</li>
    <li> Shipping took two weeks and I only payed $1 for it. Better than using toothpicks or bobby pins. With this product you get different dot sizes.&lt;br /&gt;-- Love them!! --</li>
    <li> I love the high quality of the ink. It doesn&#x27;t dry quick like other brands. The best part is how thin it releases the ink. Great for intricate designs</li>
    <li> The work youst fine , they are bery usefull . Youst wish there wre a difrent size,but besides that they are great !!!</li>
    <li> All four come in one package. different sizes. I really like this. Good when doing nail art to place gemstones, Etc. so you won&#x27;t mess up.</li>
    <li> I am a card crafter and when I saw these on an add on deal, decided to buy them to add to my embossing stash.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are really nice. Their easy to clean, you can dip nail polish in them easily, and they bring many oppurtunities for cool nail designs. I love doing my nails, and i do other people&#x27;s all the time. These tools make the perfect circles on your nails and are great. The price was also amazing. Plus, they came in quicker than the expected date of arrival. Yes, i know that the dots aren&#x27;t all different sizes, but still, i&#x27;m not disappointed. I love these dotting tools and you should definitely buy them!!! I will never go back to using tooth picks again!!! :) :) :) :) :)</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I am SO happy that I finally decided to buy them. The price was right and the quality is fantastic. I certainly suggest this to any nail lover!</li>
    <li> I love Tht the dotting tools are different sizes and they work great and love Tht they have a nice handle too</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter because she loves to do her nails.  She loves this set!!  It is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> these things are amazing and such a great price, i have already bought two sets! love, love, love! only downfall is they take forever to get to you.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them. they work great and many designs can be made with these pens. Good quality, all of them in pink which my daughter loves the most</li>
    <li> I havent tried using these but I don&#x27;t see how they could fail me. They took a while to get to my house but at that price, I didn&#x27;t mind!</li>
    <li> These tools are awesome for nail techs or beginners. These tools make it easy to make designs on nails! I may be ordering some more for gifts for others.</li>
    <li> It is great we really are enjoying using it so easy to work. Everyone who does nails should have one</li>
    <li> Amazing dotting tools to use. SO easy to use. Already did creative designs on my nails. Thanks love love love it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the dotting pen set.  They work very well in creating art on my nails. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Came late but is a great tool to have if ur into doing designs it&#x27;s a great size and great quality for starters</li>
    <li> this is  great product  I have the coolest nail art around easy to use with easy handle I can make my dots in any color</li>
    <li> I liked the dotting pins, they got the job done and they were all in the pack and none were missing. I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> i cant simply put these dotting pens down i use them every time i do my nails and is fantastic, good quality and promt delivery thank you :D</li>
    <li> i use this in painting...</li>
    <li> This set has 5 well made and very pretty tools with varying ball tips for nail design. Excellent value, I am very pleased and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It is as advertised and worth more than the cost. They work well and you have lots of size options. It just took a long time to get. I wasn&#x27;t in any hurry for them but, I forgot I had ordered them by the time I got them.</li>
    <li> I really loved these dotting tools. They&#x27;re the perfect sizes, it&#x27;s REALLY easy to use. You can be a professional nail artist or a beginner and they turn out great. 10 out of 10 for sure.</li>
    <li> I really like these dotting tools. They&#x27;re pretty and fit nicely in my smalls hands. BUT one end of the dotting tools has the same size tip as all the other pens. So instead of 10 size tips, you&#x27;re really only getting six.</li>
    <li> This came quick and was just what I had ordered. Was at a very reasonable price also, I look forward to my daughters review.</li>
    <li> one fell apart when I opened it up. Not completely glued well! However it does well for what I need it for I just need to glue together the one that fell out. Don&#x27;t have a lot of time so slightly annoying to have to take the time to do that.</li>
    <li> Recieved all five I was able to gave one to my friend. Just what I needed to make those pretty little flowers. Not a bad buy</li>
    <li> Work great with the rhinestone to line them up</li>
    <li> This work like a charm! and comes with great size options for all kinds of looks (I use them to make Mickey Mouse heads!)</li>
    <li> exactly what it says it will be perfect and definitely worth the money and wait couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else this cheap</li>
    <li> I purchased this pen set to help me to do different designs on my daughters nails. She&#x27;s only 7 now and her nails are super tiny still so it&#x27;s difficult to do anything amazing on her nails. The pens DO have different size ends on them so I could do different size dots on her nails and more often than not I did ladybugs or just a simple polka dot with the holiday theme which was super easy (you can google designs as well). I&#x27;m attaching a picture of the ends so you can see how small they get as opposed to how big they are. My set did come with different colored pens so it&#x27;s easy to decipher that &amp;#34;oh the purple one has the smallest end&amp;#34; when doing nails.</li>
    <li> best ever. variatey of sizes and super easy to use. I would definetly recommend this product to more people. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
    <li> Ordering and shipping was fast and easy.  They arrived ahead of schedule, only down side is that one of the end pieces was loose but I just glued it back together.  I love my new dotting tools!</li>
    <li> I forgot I ordered this because I still haven&#x27;t gotten it I ordered this months ago I don&#x27;t know where it is</li>
    <li> They are awesome! They work great!! I have used all sizes in in each nail design and it looks awesome!</li>
    <li> I gave these to my two 12 year old granddaughters.  They have loved them.  I&#x27;ve been impressed with their creations.</li>
    <li> I love doing nail art and these dotting pens are great! I was iffy due to the cheap price, but they were much better than expected!</li>
    <li> Great product arrived on time and is of a great quality.</li>
    <li> Works as should and is a great tool for nail art people like myself, not a waste, really nice tools :D</li>
    <li> Its horrible dont get it ever! The size is so small and no different size change they were all the same size!</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for one of my nieces.  She loves to paint and decorate her nails.  She loved these tools.  She and her friends are having a great time with them.</li>
    <li> I would almost give it four stars since one of the tips has fallen out, but can&#x27;t really complain at this price and it&#x27;s nothing a little super glue can&#x27;t fix. The smallest tip even helped me open the sim card slot on my iphone (since I don&#x27;t have any paper clips, but I happened to have these on my desk, lol). I&#x27;ve used these to paint leopard print on my nails. But I guess they&#x27;re most useful for painting dots. But it is just a metal tool, so I could see myself using these with clay modeling or whatever else comes up.</li>
    <li> I love these. They are great for making tons of fun designs! I would recommend to anyone who loves doing nail designs. A great staple for your kit!</li>
    <li> They are good but they took like a whole month to get here which really annoyed me but they are cheap since they are from China but you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> pretty quick shipping and feels to be of high quality, I have used them a few times and hold polish on them pretty good</li>
    <li> I do not understand idea of those pens. I only like price. I will not recommend it. It has not good quality of material.</li>
    <li> I liek having these around for picking up gems &amp; different rhinestones. They are nothing super fancy but they do the trick &amp; are easy to store away. Definitely a must have if you do a lot of rhinestone work!</li>
    <li> These are great! As a crafter I have various uses for these and love the different sizes!</li>
    <li> great product! worth every penny</li>
    <li> Works great I am able to do cute and fast designs. Love it! Amazing price and it arrived faster than it said it would</li>
    <li> Dotting tools, do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. Allow me to make cute nail art on my nails. That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Hmm well I thought the dotting tools would look like what they look like in the pic above. Perhaps I was wrong? It&#x27;s still GREA and all but I thought it was gonna be the same in th pic. I got diff colors with almost the same sizes, but I&#x27;m still happy. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be troubled by this....</li>
    <li> Works very well, I would buy this again and from the shipper! They work great and clean up great!!! Recommend if you like this sort of stuff!</li>
    <li> If your into nails great to purchase</li>
    <li> As promised. One side has varying sizes of dots and the other end has all the same size dots. Very easy to hold. Looks of good quality. Nice product, great price. I recommend for nail fun! Super fast delivery-way faster than estimated!</li>
    <li> These are great! But I was expecting like 10 different sizes. Instead I got 5ish. But. They still work great!</li>
    <li> Love them. There pink!!! So happy with them.</li>
    <li> Love it. Multiple sizes. Quality product snd a great price. Looking forward to buying more stuff to fo nail art.</li>
    <li> Very cool! I love how easy to use these things are! Not to mention they&#x27;re neat looking when rolled around. :)</li>
    <li> I love these alot more than other one&#x27;s i&#x27;ve purchased! I just recieved mines today and used them, they work great :) and they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
    <li> These are definitely worth it! I would buy them again. Great quality and gets the job done. No complaints! and they&#x27;re very pretty.</li>
    <li> I think the price is very reasonable .&lt;br /&gt;I love these for making polka dots, little patterns on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously you can re-use them, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re the same as pictured only the color is not the same (i.e.: who cares).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally would buy again but i doubt i&#x27;ll ever need to.</li>
    <li> the dotting tools have been great nail tools I have been able to design my nails many different ways with these.</li>
    <li> I love the dotting pen because I have been able to do my nails in so many ways thanks to this dotter. Absolutely beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> I freaken love it. They are great value for money! :)&lt;br /&gt;The colors I got varied than those shown but I didn&#x27;t mind at all!</li>
    <li> These have made doing my nails so much more fun. Lots of different sizes and you can do more than just make dots!</li>
    <li> The price is great for the quality that I get. The shipping taking a little while but surely I still get it after a week and half. I could creat many perfect design with it. No need to make ur own tool for that price.</li>
    <li> These were super cheap, but they don&#x27;t feel cheap. They are well-made and work well. I like the range of tip sizes - the smallest size really is small and is perfect for detailing. I don&#x27;t think there are actually ten different sizes, but there are several and I haven&#x27;t had the need for other sizes.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ve come in handy for other delicate tasks besides nail art.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed other people only getting one size - I ordered the &amp;#34;5 piece dotting set with 10 different sizes&amp;#34;, maybe they ordered one of the other options. All five pieces in my order were pink.&lt;br /&gt;When I bought these they were well under a dollar and free shipping. I think the current price ($2.06) is still reasonable though.</li>
    <li> They work great, and are easy to clean! I did have one metal tip fall out of the handle but I just super glued it back in and it works great. I have had them for over a year now, and they are still going strong. They come n every size you need. I love them.</li>
    <li> I Love These! Shipping came 3 weeks early! Perfect for nail art, from big to little dots. Totally recommend These!</li>
    <li> Item came in reasonable time line.  Product is as advertised.  Various sizes of dots is good and product seems to made okay.  It was inexpensive so certainly not high quality.  Having said that, some sizes of dots are so close in size, I was hoping for at least one dot to be large.  It will work for its intended purchase purpose.</li>
    <li> Cheap price just the right tool to have,I I&#x27;m really happy with this tool&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product with 5 stars</li>
    <li> I love them. So much just what I needed. And it came early than expected . Love what you can do with them different types of dots.</li>
    <li> Finally got them and I&#x27;m happy about it!</li>
    <li> I was watching tutorials online for nail art and everyone had these pens and now I know why! They make the job super easy and without a mess! The pens all have different size dots from very small to large. If you are a nail art fanatic these pens are a MUST!</li>
    <li> This are excellent for the price, I bought them for my daughter she likes them. I would recommend this excellent price!</li>
    <li> Shipping was great. Of course I got these to do styles on my nails because I love nail art. They help alot &amp; not to mention they are cute. The price was great as well.</li>
    <li> Received these super fast. These dotting tools are great. Many sizes for nail art. My daughter and I have been having fun with these. Awesome deal.</li>
    <li> I loved these when i first got them, and i still do, except that the metal parts of these have started to fall out of their casings. Its very annoying. This has happened multiple times, once when i was in the middle of doing a clients nails. They don&#x27;t stay unless you reglue them, If they hadnt started falling out of the casings i probably would&#x27;ve given this a 5 star review, but that problem is very annoying.</li>
    <li> The quality is much better than I expected to get. these are very good interments. i highly recommend them. Great price too.</li>
    <li> This set of dotting tools will fit all of your needs. Loved that so many sizes are included in this set.</li>
    <li> shipping was a bit slow but well worth it... i actually thought it only came with one dotter but i was pleasantly surprised :)&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much</li>
    <li> I  love it.it is not expensive.  you  could  design your nails. I am practicing a  lot  and  it is not difficult.</li>
    <li> My sister is a nail tech and always does fun things on my nails.  These were another hip2save posting and so I got them for her to use on me and her customers.</li>
    <li> The dotting tools came much earlier than expected and though there are only 6 different sized dots, the tools are definitely worth the price! This was a great value!</li>
    <li> I bought these specifically for my daughter as she loves to do her nails. She loves them. Turns out I am using them just as much! They were just as described. I did contact the seller on a different order (in regard to others who didn&#x27;t get what they expected) and heard back within a day and they fixed the problem ASAP. Would definitely order from them again!</li>
    <li> Great for making designs on your nails, they work much better than toothpicks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only this is, there are NOT 10 different sizes as advertised. There are 5 pens but each one of them have a same size tip on one side, so there are actually only 5 different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like it is a big problem because there are enough size differences among the 5 sizes for use. I really like the size of the &amp;#34;repeated size&amp;#34; as well so I don&#x27;t mind having those extra tips since I use them most often. Nice product for a great price!</li>
    <li> I just love this product. It is very helpful and easy to use. I use them all the time. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I got five different sizes.  But I&#x27;m lucky that I noticed that because three of the five of them had the tips fall out as soon as I took them out of the package.  I had to get down on my hands and knees to try to find them.  Not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to complain too much, because the price was good! However, the plastic it&#x27;s made out of is very cheap, it start to crack inside, around the metal part and then the tips would break off. Cheaply made.</li>
    <li> :) they were what I expected. .. I like the color.  And that they were different sizes of dots.  Excelente product</li>
    <li> These are a Solid set of dotting tools. They work and are cute. Plus they were very inexpensive.Works for me!</li>
    <li> These were a lot of fun and a great value. They should sell them in the craft section too. They would be great for embossing work or sculpting. For nail work they are great for making different size dots of a contrasting color of polish over a base color. They also clean easily with polish remover. I was glad I found them. :)</li>
    <li> These pens are intended for creating dots in nail art, but they will do just fine in regular art projects as well. They can be used to add paint dots to paintings or mixed media projects. They can also be used to create lines in wax and other soft substances on canvas or boards. Very cool!</li>
    <li> They are so helpful with designing your nails, very easy to clean and are great ti try new styles. search a tutorial for max use and you&#x27;re set.</li>
    <li> I love nail art and recently I saw a friend with some very cool designs on her nails. She said she used dotting tools. I went to my local beauty store and they didn&#x27;t have any so I figured Amazon has got to they have EVERYTHING! I came across these and immediately ordered them it did take about 2 weeks to reach me. I am very impressed they are very easy to use and are made to dip in acrylic paint or nail polish to create all sorts of designs not just dots. They are well made and do not feel cheap at all If you are hesitant order these you wont be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are well made&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun to create designs with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;  none</li>
    <li> I love the way that the look. They also have different sizes which allows me to make different size dots. Now all that is left is for me to master the use of these.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people make dotting tools at home when you can purchase these cute ones for so little(convenient and uniform). I haven&#x27;t painted my nails in awhile but I like them. Just be aware that it&#x27;s only 4 different tools, with 5 tips(2 tools are the same, one is flipped to the bottom dotter to make it seem like they&#x27;re all different). For this price though there isn&#x27;t any need to complain :)</li>
    <li> I already had a set of these, but because I do my own nails ALL the time, my co-workers and daughters started doing theirs.  But weren&#x27;t getting the results they wanted, because they didn&#x27;t have the right tools, so I ordered a few of these.  They are multi-colored (Green, white, yellow, blue and pink).  I received these today.  There are 6 different sized dots, that&#x27;s fine, will work for what they are needed for.  But delivery, HOLY COW!!! Estimated from Dec. 26th - Jan 14th.....2 weeks early!!!!! Which is great because they are part of Christmas baskets!!!! Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> Product was okay, took a while to come, and when i received it, one of the dotting heads fell off, i can glue it back though, pretty cheap price, my beauty supply store sells it for almost 5 bucks so i came out winning, just a little patience and a little glue lol</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved these!!!! They were even better than I expected them to be and the colors are fantastic. :)</li>
    <li> These are great!! I use them all the time. It took a little while to get them but for the price it was worth the wait. The only down side is the opposite end of each one is the same size. If there were 10 different sizes instead of 5 I would give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Great item, even better price! This tool is great for my mani pedi&#x27;s and makes a great design tool! Works great with the mani sized ends. thanks</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of using the doting tools they are easy to use.  I&#x27;ve done several different designs and people think I got my nails done at the salon.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.  The pen&#x27;s I got were a green color.  Got a 2nd set for a gift &amp; it was appreciated.</li>
    <li> Ordered about 2 weeks ago, got them today I am really excited to use them! So many youtubers recommend them for nail art.</li>
    <li> yes it works good but I&#x27;m not happy because I paid for 10 different sizes and I got 6 the same sizes which is ridiculous. Just please beware!!</li>
    <li> Did my nails for the first time with these dotting tools and they came out amazing! They weren&#x27;t hard to use either. I see some people in reviews of dotting tools complain that they are all the same size but these ones have a good variety and the dotting tools themselves are really pretty. Totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This products metal spoke broke after one use.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. You get what you pay for. M</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I bought something for my nails (besides nail polish) and I was surprised with these! The pen set it&#x27;s really easy to use, I use them to make flowers</li>
    <li> I love to do my own nails, and these tools have helped me step up my game from solid colored nails to nails with some dots, lines, or other designs. I love them and the price was perfect!</li>
    <li> these dotting pens are awesome there easier to use than others. there not too big not too small and they come in different colors</li>
    <li> these dotting tools are great! really high quality for such a low price! I love it! the tools are very durable and perfect for all sorts of nail art!</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend and form what she says it work great no issues and would definitely recommend it to any one who like to make their nail look all pretty, or does nail art as their occupation or hobby.</li>
    <li> Love the item. Helps me to decorate my young daughters nails just like her mommy. Great for mommy daughter time.</li>
    <li> Was excited to receive these so I could use them on my daughters. They fell apart as soon as I took them out of the package. The silver tips are very loose.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal and they arent cheap like I thought they might be. I love these. You get a lot of different sizes so you&#x27;ll definitely be able to do whatever it is you want.</li>
    <li> Very good quality! I love how they come in different sizes and colors!!! I really love them very nice!! Great material😀</li>
    <li> These are great! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since they were so cheap, but they went beyond my expectations. They&#x27;re easy to use and have a wide range of sizes. None of them came broken, and they arrived before the arrival date. I would highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> Although it took two weeks to come it came a week and a half before the estimated date which made me very happy! They are indeed all different sizes unlike some reviews I read. Nothing seems broken and all is good.</li>
    <li> Well made.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for making flowers and designs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a Master pedicurist for 26 years.&lt;br /&gt;I know my stuff. :)</li>
    <li> So not use with acetone ate right through the glue holding in the metal parts and cracked the plastic</li>
    <li> i love the different sizes,how colorful they are and how useful they have become to me,if i ever need a new set again,i will purchase these again</li>
    <li> Cheap and work perfect!</li>
    <li> Unlike some other reviewers I actually received differently sized 5 x 2 as the product description suggests. I am happy with the product</li>
    <li> I purchased to give to my daughters as stocking stuffers for Christmas but they saw them before I could hide them. They are enjoying their new nail design tools.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done so many designs with these and get a lot of compliments.I read the reviews before buying and was skeptical because most people said all one size but the ones i got were actually different sizes. I guess i was a lucky one.. :p</li>
    <li> It took awhile to get but when I got it, it was great and the price was great too!!! And I just started getting into doing my own nails</li>
    <li> Great pruduct ,great shipping, great dots  i luv my dotting tool when i heard of it i thought it was stupid untill i  got more in to nails using a bobby pin or a  tooth pick anyoed me but this makes all types of dots great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty obsessed with all things manicure-related, and it wasn&#x27;t until recently that I started getting into my own nail art designs instead of those stick-on decals and stick-on polish kits. I figured that this kit would be a great start, and I believe that I made an excellent choice. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dotting tools are perfect for simple designs, such as marbleizing or basic art, such as the &amp;#34;quilt&amp;#34; look, or even constellations. I&#x27;ve done quite a few different designs with these bad boys, and they&#x27;ve all turned out perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you should know before purchasing these dotting pens is that they are just that: Dotting tools. None of them have any fancy tips; they&#x27;re all just small spheres used to create different sized dots, or to swirl your nail polish around to create beautiful designs. The more you use them, the more you&#x27;ll fall in love with them. Just don&#x27;t forget to clean them with a cotton swab and nail-polish remover after every use!</li>
    <li> If you want the perfect polka dot nail art then these are the babies to buy! Super cheap &amp; I use them for about everything, hearts, flowers etc! Makes the PERFECT circle! You can choose from 10 different sizes, I can&#x27;t see myself using anything else.</li>
    <li> they were in excellent condition when i got them and i just love them they come in all the right sizes for all the right occasions!</li>
    <li> These are a definitely needed tool if you do nail art, they handle very well and have every size you need.  It just adds more fun and creativity to doing your nails!</li>
    <li> Excellent for theb price</li>
    <li> Works great, very sturdy material.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my sister for Christmas, I orderd the Pink set but when they arrived they were all different colors.. I would return them to possibly get the pink set but it took so long to get here i&#x27;d be scared that it wouldnt show up in time for christmas.. They are very nice pens I just wish I would have gotten what I orderd.</li>
    <li> These work great! I use them all the time now when doing my nails. It comes with a variety in sizes as well!</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. They work great and are exactly what I ordered. Definitely would recommend these to anyone looking to buy nail art dotters.</li>
    <li> Really good for the price, yes some of the sides are the same, but that is great for doing multiple colors in one size :)</li>
    <li> Great price and very useful. I am beyond pleased with this product. You can not get them for this price any where eles</li>
    <li> they are very good! It is very easy and useful to be used. I like it! But it will be better if the set is made of same colore</li>
    <li> was very excited to have a fun way to decorate my nails, but to this day have not seen the product. I believe I ordered in over 3 months ago. I got one email from the company saying they are sorry and they have no idea when or if product is coming. Product should be taken off if item cant be mailed out.</li>
    <li> Got these pretty fast was surprised I used them once just got to get use to using them but not too bad as a product</li>
    <li> My teen wanted to start doing her own nails..as part of her tools needed to do nail art painting these are a good choice..well made..strong..good grip..</li>
    <li> I was given a set of theses for Christmas two years ago and love using them. I loved them so much and have fun decorating my nails with them, that I bought my mom some. She loves them as well. They are good little dotting pens</li>
    <li> Great for dots and lines when painting fingernails. Easy to use.arrived faster than stated.great price. Fun. Was actually 9 sizes,not 10 , since 1 size was a duplicate,but still a great set.</li>
    <li> I love variety when it comes to dotting tools. I still use them and it&#x27;s been a year now.</li>
    <li> These work just as well as the \\&quot;high end\\&quot; dotting tools and are a fraction of the cost with the same quality and results!</li>
    <li> Great fun for girls who do their on mani&#x27;s and pedi&#x27;s.  Easy to work with.  Tips are varied in size.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my nieces to do their nails. They love to use the different sizes. Not bad for $1</li>
    <li> I just do nail art for fun. I am definitely  not a professional and not even that good. But I wanted to try to do polka dot designs and flowers and was not having much luck with toothpicks, etc that you use at home. I got a little nail art kit at walmart for kids, but the dotting tool included was very very tiny. These contain the bigger ones that are really cool for simple designs. One thing I noticed though is that I thought there would be ten different sizes, because there are five double ended tools. In reality, there are I believe 6 different sizes. Each tool has one side with different sizes, and then the other end all five of them have the same basic small size. I guess this is intended so you always have that small size on hand? But in any case, there are NOT ten sizes. Other than that, these are great and look really well made, don&#x27;t look like they will fall apart or anything at all and they&#x27;re cute! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This item came here way earlier than it had said.Everything came in Perfect condition.I would recommend this item to anyone if your obsessed like me on doing any time of nailart!</li>
    <li> Love doing my kid&#x27;s nails and she loves designs.  So I purchased these babies and they work great.  Have used them numerous times.</li>
    <li> I just received my dotting tools in the mail today and immediately started to use them, of course! I have about six different sizes and that&#x27;s all I really need. Gave it four stars because I did notice one of the dotting tools tip was loose. Other than that I love this product! Also, it came 12 days before it said it would. Very happy nail art beginner :)</li>
    <li> It does an adequate job and is very easy to clean.  They seem to be made well.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t go to get my nails done often but I do create designs myself when I polish my nails. I love these tools. I have made make-shift dotting tools before, but they are temporary. These com in a good variety of sizes and clean up easily. I like the little pouch they come in.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these a whole lot, but for what they are they are just fine. TOok a while to get them, but I expected that,.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting them to be feel so heavy.  Much better quality than I expected.  I&#x27;m considering ordering more for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> I bought these to make a nail design i saw on youtube. All i can say they are just like any other design tool. One thing I did notice is that its very hard to get a handle of them. It most likely I just need practice. I did not like how they came packaged though, Seemed very cheap but I guess its you get what you paid for. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> One of the tips was completely broken off but a little hot glue will put it back. Don&#x27;t appreciate that this is my 3rd bad review in a row on Amazon</li>
    <li> Seem sturdy and has different sizes on the tips which helps with making designs on nails.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle.Good price.</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools.  They are definitely a good bang for the buck! I use them all the time.  Pretty self explanitary</li>
    <li> Superb product. The Dotting Pen Set for nail Manicure is strong and easy to use I recommend it 100%. The order arrived ahead of schedule. I was very satisfied</li>
    <li> These make nail designs so easy!  My daughters and I love to create new nail designs and this made it easy!</li>
    <li> I ordered about 3 weeks ago and just got it today.. the product itself looks very sturdy and not breakable but very time consuming</li>
    <li> I could not wait to receive these tools, but...When I pulled them out, one of the metal dotting tools end fell right out .very disappointed. Gave it 2 stars because the price was good for how many tools came n the pack .just hope I can use the rest without any more falling out.</li>
    <li> Reliable to make different designs on nails. The pack brings 5 and it is exactly how the advertisement says it. The tips have different sizes for different types I designs you want to make.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, I use it more than once a week. It is good quality and great colors, really cool.</li>
    <li> I love this. it comes in many different sizes that can create designs from small polka dots to flowers and mickey heads! Most deff worth it</li>
    <li> i have nothing but good things to say about this product. i love how they are all different sizes so you can get the perfect design for your nails every time. i would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered these a whilllleeee ago but i still use them to this very day. They are easy to hold and are very cute. They make A LOT of nail designs easy now and it is worth it.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very useful. I love them. I use them for most of my design and they perform very well. I definitely reccomned this product.</li>
    <li> These work alright and weren&#x27;t too expensive, but they&#x27;re extremely delicate. Three of the five broke within the first couple months of usage. One of the tips detached from the handle (they&#x27;re skinny metal tips inserted into either side of the plastic handle), and the other two had snapped plastic handles.</li>
    <li> These tools help me dot like they are intended for and also help me with my water marble. Love these tools</li>
    <li> I really like these dotting tools! :) They have different sizes except for one of them, this would be the yellow tool. It has the same size on both ends. However, it doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest. Since where I live, I can never find dotting tools. The shipping came in quicker than I thought it would. (A few days before the estimated date given by Amazon)I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase, especially the price. If you&#x27;re like me, a little wary about money-spending but still want their item, look no further! This is the product to buy. :)</li>
    <li> I ordered the dotting pens on November 8th. It is now December 27th and they still have not arrived. I will NOT order from this merchant ever again. I&#x27;m totally disgusted with having to wait so long. True, I spent next to nothing for them but money spent is money wasted. I chose one star because there wasn&#x27;t anything lower I could choose. Total waste of time and money. Not to mention if/when they arrive they may not be the product as shown in the pic as some other buyers have stated. Might be better off winning the lottery than getting this thing anytime soon and it being the product as shown.</li>
    <li> These came way faster than I thought they would. I got multiple colors instead of just pink, but that is not an issue for me. They do what they are meant to do.</li>
    <li> Everything about these brushes has been ideal for what I need! Love the availability of so many different sizes and the price is perfect! Have held up to being dropped on a tile floor multiple times, too!</li>
    <li> Like the different sizes of the dotting pens. Can save money at the nail salon by doing my own designs.</li>
    <li> The tools come in different sizes on the tips so you can create a different look when you want to change up the design on your nails great tool for any type of nail design.</li>
    <li> It was exactly how it was described,  all of the little ball were a different size, I got the different color one and they are very pretty.</li>
    <li> amazing works great and does what it id suppose ti do. pretty colors as well. very happy with it .</li>
    <li> A nice selection of sizes with some funky twisted handles to make them stand out for easy locating in a nail bag!</li>
    <li> The dotting tools came at time expected so that is always a plus. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that they were not the color shown, but were multicolored. Quality was good but I do like to get what I see.</li>
    <li> The product is of a good quality. The tools are heavy and made of a good material. Only issue I had was that in the discription it says they are a pack of multi-colors.. However, when I received the order.. They were all Pink! This is a gift and I am glad that the recipient is a fan of pink because I am not! So it still works out but I do wish that they wouldve come in the multi-color pack like stated in the description.</li>
    <li> This product came exactly as the picture, and work well. They are sturdy and pretty. Also its definitley worth the cheap cost! you&#x27;d see this at like target for at least 6 or 8 $</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s very convenient to use. I use it to make several beautiful nail design. You really should try this product if you are a nail artist.</li>
    <li> There were a few of the dame tips, but, my daughter found that it makes it easier to use multiple colors simultaneously. Not bad idea after all.</li>
    <li> First of all, I received the wrong color of the pens (I had ordered the pink). I had to email the seller to send a replacement. After the replacement came, I found that the tools were different than the picture; I had wanted the needle tool that was pictured but received the wrong set. The reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because the tools were good quality and did not break apart.</li>
    <li> I love using thse dotting pens for my polish but also for my regular art paints on paper it has been fun experementing.</li>
    <li> I thought my set was supposed to be all pink the advertising was a gag I received doffrent colored tools but well they do the job so okay great I guess</li>
    <li> They work really well and all but one of the dotting tools lost there dot and i was able to fix it though</li>
    <li> Great dotting tools, they came in different sizes and are really handly, also not bad for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> These are a great set for the money.  I keep them in the plastic carrying case they came with in my nail art bag along-side my stampers/scrapers.  I use these for dotting, applying rhinestones and fimos, marbeling, and other nail art tasks.  I would recommend these to any nail art enthusiast.</li>
    <li> Great tools. Like mentioned before, one end of each pen is the same size across all of them so you&#x27;re really getting 5 sizes, which is fine. Took awhile to ship, but that&#x27;s understandable. Good product so far!</li>
    <li> As a gift I cannot answer this. the giftee seemed too like them but had not used them.  She is an artist so i am sure she does by now.</li>
    <li> only problem i had was the second side of all of them were the exact same size also bought a set for my friend</li>
    <li> for some reason i think that they would look big but the work perfect small but perfect! my sister loves them i do too</li>
    <li> These are fantastic! All sizes you need, super cute, super cheap, work perfectly, good quality. No problems. I love it.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my tiny little nails. It creates perfect little dots. I usually don&#x27;t even use all of them. one or two tips are enough to make multiple size dots. You just have play around with how much polish you&#x27;re dipping on and etc.</li>
    <li> to be honest i hate them its a waste of money because they were  bad quality broke within a few days</li>
    <li> it is over a month over due and there is nothing i can do about this stupid thing errr&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62;:(</li>
    <li> The dotting tools were delivered on time, and they are what was shown on the picture on this listing. Had them for a few months now, and I have had no issues with them.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. Trick is to hold the dotting tool straight while dipping into polish. I like it.</li>
    <li> Love them great price and love all the different sizes I can choose from when making designs with dots would recommed</li>
    <li> Took a while to receive but i expected that coming from China....Didn&#x27;t use them till few weeks after i got them. I do the water marble on my nails once a week and sometimes do other friends and family members nails. These work great adding dots around swirl lines in the water marble designs. my nails look great and different (:</li>
    <li> Although I just realized I did not get the color advertized but that doesn&#x27;t matter. These dotters work great and hold up well. The only reson for 4 stars instead of 5 was the slow shipping. Don&#x27;t order them if you need them in the next week! Haha.</li>
    <li> Love the dotting tools. I got these for my sister and she loves them and so excited to try them out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech and this was a great deal. Usually one dotter will cost you at the least $3.00. So to get 5 for less than the price of 1. I would have been foolish to pass up that offer. Great quality material and very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> They all came in pink (not as advertised) and one of the tips are broken nothing super glue cant fix, They are not all the same size thank god, Shipping Was Average a week and a half. Overall A good buy</li>
    <li> The tools are useful and create wonderful dots but the tips keep falling out of the tool. I have to glue them back into the tool in order to use them.</li>
    <li> These are super easy to use and they pay for themselves after just one use. A polka dot manicure at a salon can easily cost $20. I&#x27;ve saved 100s with these and I love the multiple sizes so I have options to vary my look.</li>
    <li> They took a while to get here but I&#x27;ve been able to polish and use these to dot my own designs.  Even my nail tech was so surprised and thought I did a good job designing my own nails when I went back for my fill.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. wished it came with simple diy nail design picture book....love it. its so simple to use and the results are amazing!</li>
    <li> I love it it makes your toes and your hands look so much cuter and now I don&#x27;t even have to go to the nail shop to just get a manicure and pedicure now I can actually do it to myself and it looks fantastic I totally recommend it to anyone and everyone does it matter if you&#x27;re one-year-old or you&#x27;re an 80-year-old it looks fantastic on everyone and it comes with like all sorts of sizes and is just great</li>
    <li> I got these today and they are not all pink and some of the other reviews say that there all the same size but i got diffrent sizes so that kind of made me happy</li>
    <li> I finally used these, and they worked like a charm.  I got a design close to a salon, and was pleased with the ease of use.</li>
    <li> Came way before the shipping said it would. The pens poked thru the plastic holder it was in but no big deal I just threw it out and put them in my nail tool box :) Does a good job putting little dots on my nails with the polish :)</li>
    <li> Love them they work for what I need them for</li>
    <li> came as described, its a fine product.</li>
    <li> I love these tools. It took me a bit to get used to but now I can do soo many designs. It looks cool if you lay the tools on a hard flat surface &amp; roll them, looks like those poll things at the barber shop. Good price too</li>
    <li> if you love doing nails, this product is great. good quality. bought for my little sister. took a while to get here, but the end result is good-as well as the price! can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Other reviews say that the tips come off, I have had them for almost a year and they are still in perfect condition. I do have to say that one side of the tip they are all the same size, but the other end does have a size variation. The size of the dot also depends on how hard you press on the nail polish. I love them!</li>
    <li> These were much more useful than we thought before ordering.  Very easy to use and clean.  I ordered this for my daughter, a 21 yo friend of ours and me, we all have fun doing nails together.  We still have them, and all of us enjoying using them making nail designs we find on YouTube.com</li>
    <li> I am not a professional but I like fun and trendy nails, so this set will be useful in learning new styles.  I am going to enjoy practicing on my daughter&#x27;s nails.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Wish I could put into words how much I love my dotting tools! I use them for dots, and other art designs, because I have a hard time holding a brush. These are a MUST for anyone who is interested in nail art. Pick up a set, watch some videos on YouTube, and do your own fancy nails!</li>
    <li> Great  over all just love it can&#x27;t say anything bad about it just love it so much yay! Lol u</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to try some fun nail art and this seemed like the perfect set of dotting tools. I really love the design of these and the fact that both sides of the dotting pens can be used (although they are different sizes). As far as price, these can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality, my only qualm is that when I was doing my sister&#x27;s nails it was my first time using on of the dotting pens and the metal tip (the whole metal piece that has the &amp;#34;dot&amp;#34; sphere at the end) came right out of the pen base (the clear/pink middle section). I am just going to superglue it back in, but it makes me wonder if this will happen to the other ones. In any case, In any case, this is not a deal breaker for me because I don&#x27;t mind that I will re-glue it back in.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to someone looking for a nice, compact set of dotting tools.</li>
    <li> love these tools. they are fun and great if u have an imagination to can do anything with these tools...</li>
    <li> Nice for the price, even though one of the tips broke off after a couple of uses. They are nice.</li>
    <li> Love this item....I purchased this along with Nail art gems and set of 10 nail tape stripe. I am getting great use out of all of the items.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> These are easy to use. Gets the job done and creates some cute nail designs. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> One Of The Best Dotting Tools I&#x27;ve Ever Had The Chance To Use. I Love Doing Polka Dots With This Tool.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast. everything was in one piece when it got to my door  and these guys are so much fun! My nails never looked so good!</li>
    <li> This product is just as advertised, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I bought 2 sets and they only send me one and it tool too long for them to understand when I made the complaint, finally got a refund but the product is good.</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are AMAZING, 10 different sized tips for doing perfect nail art. The dotting pens are well constructed and will give me many many uses for many years to come.. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product for anyone who loves nail art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> the dotting tools came much earlier than I expected. I love them but I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because there is at least 3 that are the same size.</li>
    <li> These pens are an excellent bargain at this price. I purchased them for a gift for my daughter-in-law to be.</li>
    <li> I like that they are dual ended! I am trying to do nail art for the first time and thought that this would help me with making simple designs as I learn!</li>
    <li> This product is extremely late I&#x27;ve been looking forward to using it but it never showed up I&#x27;m very frustrated and angry. This was a complete waste of money. I would have rather spent the extra money buying a product that actually came in on time. I am so upset and frustrated /:(</li>
    <li> I use these to apply nail polish patterns to my nails BUT also to apply paint in several crafting activities (painting fabric, painting gourds) and they&#x27;re great for that too - and cheap!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought it would to receive the product. Works great and gives you many size options.</li>
    <li> Honestly you can&#x27;t get a better deal on this item. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but you can tell they are made very well and great quality, and you cannot beat this price!</li>
    <li> they work really good and I love all the sizes</li>
    <li> These are great and I love that they come in different sizes. I have only used them to make polka dots on my nails, but my daughter used the biggest one and red nail polish to make cherries on her nails.</li>
    <li> The nail dotters work very good and come in a variety of different sizes, but some of them have started breaking! The good thing is though, I can fix them with super glue. Yay! Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> love the way these look, and am very satisfied with the service. I had some regular brown ones, but these have a lot more different sizes of dotters. Very pretty and easy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect when I&#x27;m doing my friends design.</li>
    <li> This item came faster than expected . I&#x27;ve used them multiple times already . They are easy to use . The only problem is some are the same size .</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the Dotting Pen Set for nail art, I actually bought it to use for doing my ceramics.&lt;br /&gt;The tips are perfect size for many smaller jobs that I need</li>
    <li> Very good products, just as shown in the picture. I&#x27;m so satisfied with them. Also, it didn&#x27;t take that long to receive it. Roughly took only 2 weeks. Love it!</li>
    <li> bought these for my daughter for christmas but couldn&#x27;t wait so i gave them to her, she loved them. so many sizes. shipping fast. will buy again</li>
    <li> Love this product. Cute colors, very sturdy. Handy for small finishes on manicures! Adds character and color to a simple manicure!</li>
    <li> We are using these dotting tools for face painting (tiny white dots around our face paint designs).  Several of them make the same size dots.  Not much difference in size of the dots, but pretty handles!</li>
    <li> Simple tool, exactly as described.  A variety of sizes is included in the package.  I have already used them several times.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT every size very good perfect for nail designs they are great quality thank you so much. (:</li>
    <li> These are great if you like to put designs/rhinestones on your nails. I haven&#x27;t used them much to tell you how durable they are, but for the price...great buy.</li>
    <li> Great product. These dotting pens are good quality. All of them have one side in the same size and the other one is different on all of them.</li>
    <li> Well what can I say, this is a great product, it&#x27;s good for it&#x27;s price and the shipment was faster than I expected!</li>
    <li> These nail art tools worked very well! They did exactly what I expected them to do and they were very easy to use. I would highly recommend this if you like doing nail designs</li>
    <li> Amazing for doing designs, details or polka dots on your nails.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to do her nails in designs she finds on pinterest. These tools are quality and give her more control and detail.</li>
    <li> I wanted these for Easter gifts but they arrived after Easter. They were for my granddaughters so they have not been used yet.</li>
    <li> Not really bad quality...just two of the tips I had to glue back in myself because they had fallen out. They aren&#x27;t bad for the price if you&#x27;re just starting out doing your nails.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for daughter-in-law.  I put together several nail art items in a box and she loved it!</li>
    <li> I love these.  The only problem is that the smallest one breaks easily. I didn&#x27;t care for them we&#x27;ll I guess.</li>
    <li> Some of these are the same size. Not what I wanted. It showed they was all different sizes but they aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly for any kind of dotting work. The size variance gives them awesome versatility. I use these almost every time that I paint my nails; as long as you clean them off in between each color, these work like a charm. A great buy, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> bought it as a stocking stuffer for a creative person that wanted dots on her nails. it is well liked</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product, however it was sent in a purple coler rather than the pink so it would be helpful if the picture was correct for the item.</li>
    <li> I loved them! I got them pretty cheap, I Thought they were going to feel cheap, but they don&#x27;t! (:</li>
    <li> they pretty cute i havent use them but i use to have some on the past and they work really good i bought it for a gift ... hope my sister in law likes  it&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> My first time dotting, these worked great and you can&#x27;t beat the price.. I&#x27;ve just recently started doing designs on my nails, I normally would just paint them a solid color, but now I&#x27;m into trying different things. These are great for the price and enjoy using them!!</li>
    <li> Have yet to receive my product dont no whats the hold up but it almost been 3 months I keep getting the run around.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Too good for my nails! The dotting tool is a real help for events and party&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> These are pretty fun to play around with. It took me a while to figure out how to use them to get the desired nail art, but I seem to have it down now.  So don&#x27;t worry if it doesn&#x27;t come out perfect the first time you try. Some of the tips are nearly the same size as some of the others, so it seems like you don&#x27;t get as many options as you were expecting.  Overall though, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love these nail art pens, I can&#x27;t wait till I can actually use them though and do peoples nails for fun :D</li>
    <li> These work pretty nicely. You just dip the ends in nail polish and then dott your nails. I made my toe nails ladybug colors:)</li>
    <li> These are great and really pretty to look at. They&#x27;re easy to clean and came in a neat little package for storage.</li>
    <li> Super awesome easy now to make poka dots on your nails:) shoppin kinda took a while but this is so cheap and awesome I don&#x27;t really even care</li>
    <li> I love these there&#x27;s so many designs you can do. Snowmen for winter. Sun for summer. Leaves for fall. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets of these.  We have already put them to use.  They have worked out great.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> one  side  is  all  the  same  size  but I  knew that  when I  bought  it  plus  you  don&#x27;t  need 10  different  side  dots  five  is  plenty  trust  me ...  great  quality great price just a  good  product, I  recommend  it</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are amazing i would recommend them. they came in and work great. but for begginers instructions on how to do dotting would work</li>
    <li> These are very well made tools. I was surprised on how heavy they were. I had ordered a set before and since I like them so well, I ordered a second set for my daughter in law.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertized, pretty good quality. Arrived on time as expected. Happy with my purchase, I&#x27;m off to play with nail polish.</li>
    <li> I got my dotting pens about a week before they were supposed to arrive so i was pleasantly surprised by that. They also are made very well and none of the tips fell out during shipping, or while being used. They are so cute and make beautiful designs. I&#x27;m SO happy i bought these and for such a great price!! I definitely recommend these to anyone who likes to do their nails</li>
    <li> I find these dotting pens are great for applying nail designs wether it be nail polish or using them to apply stickers or glitter to my nails</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe there are other websites selling these for $8-$15!  These make the most perfect little circles on your nails and so easy to do on yourself.  Just wipe clean with nail polish remover when your done and that&#x27;s all.  I&#x27;ve used these a ton of times and nothing bad has ever happened.  Great great item to have in your nail art stash!</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I expected and they are so much fun! It was at a great price too. It makes doing nail art so much easier with these tools.</li>
    <li> Perfect tool for dotting as well as use for picking up gems when needed.  Great price.  Great as a gift to for that person who is into nails like me.</li>
    <li> I was so surprised when I received the Dotting Set!  The photo didn&#x27;t do it justice...it is beautiful and very well made!  I bought the set for my daughter and was so excited to surprise her with such a cool item!</li>
    <li> love, love, love these dotting tools. so easy to use and the marble coloring on the handles is pretty. very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and value for the price. The quality is unbelievable for such a low cost.  I have shared this along with other products to my local nail salon to save them a lot of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will save me money by allowing me to do my nails at home.</li>
    <li> I have used these over and over again. They work like a charm. I would tell anyone who does their own nail art to invest in these.</li>
    <li> I was getting tired of using the head on a needle to do dots, so I decided to get these. They work sooooo much better than a needle. I love how they come in different sizes and I love the design in the dotting tool itself.</li>
    <li> When buying these you don&#x27;t think you will actually use all 5 dotting tools but you actually do.&lt;br /&gt;they are well made and a bargin for the price you pay... i would highly recommend this product to any nail art lover!</li>
    <li> I love these tools I use them all the time in my field and they came in great condition and have held up well through the daily abuse I put them through!</li>
    <li> Now I won&#x27;t have to use same one for different colors.  Arrived sooner than expected and works great!</li>
    <li> Very good with an even better price!</li>
    <li> Poor quality broke after just a few uses. Thank goodness they are cheap.</li>
    <li> My daughter enjoys using them and makes a lot of projects with them</li>
    <li> There great. Hard to use if you&#x27;re a beginner</li>
    <li> These are nice to work  with.</li>
    <li> I ordered Dotting 5 X 2 Way Marbleizing Dotting Pen Set for Nail Art Manicure Pedicure, 4 Ounce. In the picture of the product I ordered, it showed all pink tools, which I didn&#x27;t care for. I placed this order on June 26th 2014, and it arrived on July 14, 2014. Given that it is shipped from Shen Zhen, China to Hawaii, this is pretty quick. (Roughly 2 and 1/2 weeks). I plan to use these tools for both polymer clay crafting, and nail art. Here is my Pros and Cons upon opening the package and first sight impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*False appearance advertising - colors: My first impression was the fact that I was expecting all pink tools. When I opened my package, I received tools that came in green, blue, white, pink, and orange. Although the color of the tools don&#x27;t bother me, this is just a generalization awareness that imagery posted on the product page is not accurate, so if you&#x27;re concerned about color, this is to let you know that imagery posted and product received is different, color-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*False appearance advertising - dotting size: If you look closely on the product image (one with all the pink tools) that was posted, both ends have different sizes that would escalate from small to big. This is not true. I lined up my tools from the dot size being small to big on one end, but when I looked at the other end, all the dot size were the same. I even measured it with a ruler, and they were all the same size that measures 1/16 inches. I ended up with 6 dot sizes being 1/16&amp;#34;, and the rest being different size. Just to forewarn ahead of time that you are not guaranteed 10 different dot size.  I guess this depends on the merchant as I have read from other reviews saying they received pens that came in 10 different size??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Packaging - material: My package came in a very small bubble envelope mailer. I couldn&#x27;t rip the envelope open with my hands, so I decided to cut it open with a pair of scissors. I cut off the top of the envelope, and not knowingly, I&#x27;ve also cut off a small portion of the case that holds the tools. The case that holds the tools is a cheap quality plastic case. The best way to describe this material is probably a plastic beach bag, but more flimsy. A tip for those looking into keeping the plastic case: If you also need to cut open your package, cut from the side carefully, then pull the envelope apart. I do not plan to keep this case, so damaging the case upon opening the product did not bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, these are all the cons. I will update if there are more I find later, but these cons are general first contact with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for crafting: As mentioned above, I plan to use these tools as a part of my crafting needs. Polymer Clay in particular, so for a cheap price of $2 this is not all that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sturdyness: I was worried about the tools falling apart as some other customer reviews had mentioned, but my tools were sturdy. The dot heads sit firmly on top of the pen shaped tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size: The length of this pen fits nicely in my hands. (holding length is about 3 and 15/16&amp;#34;, total length from tip end to tip end measures 5 and 1/16&amp;#34;) I have very small hands and holding these tools don&#x27;t seem to be a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Variety colors : As mentioned above, I expected my set to come in all pink, but the variation colors that was sent to me would help me recognize the dot size easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, there are pros and cons to these dotting pens. Surely, it is cheaper than to go out and buy expensive tools. If you&#x27;re looking for variation of dot sizes, it&#x27;s a gamble whether you&#x27;ll receive what you see in the images that were posted. Keep in mind that shipping speed varies, so if you&#x27;re in a hurry, this may not be the best option for you. If you&#x27;re looking into using these tools for your crafting needs, they make wonderful dimples, dots, and sometimes, better thanusing a paintbrush. Although the case is not the best case out there, I do not plan on keeping the case, because it has this rubbery nasty smell to it. I hope this review will help you determine your decision on purchasing this product.using a paintbrush. Although the case is not the best case out there, I do not plan on keeping the case, because it has this rubbery nasty smell to it. I hope this review will help you determine your decision on purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Great product and price!</li>
    <li> Got them really fast!  But after the first try, one of the tip came off, had to use crazy glue to put them back together.</li>
    <li> The tools have the same size ball on one end of all of them but on the other side the sizes vary from smaller to larger. I get a lot of use out of them when I do designs and none of the have broken on me (yet). They are pretty durable if you take care of them and the price is great!</li>
    <li> They arrived early and everything was intact! I used them as soon as I got them. All the tools are different sizes there were no replicas! I wild definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product although there are some that are the same size. I don&#x27;t mind at all so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Overall good quality.</li>
    <li> Really cute design and loved using them until I lent it to a friend and she lost them</li>
    <li> Love these, they work exactly as I expected, and I love the color.</li>
    <li> ecellent,my daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my pre-teen daughter to paint her nails and her freinds&#x27; nails.  She was thrilled with this set!  It helps her to do the detail that she wants.  One of the tips did loosen and came off, but we just super glued it back on.</li>
    <li> The kit has all sizes, so my daughter has been practicing more on her nail art :) She sends me pictures when she is done</li>
    <li> Works great so far.  Different size heads assist in making different designs. Comes in a good package that helps keep them stored together.  Pretty design of the sticks themselves.</li>
    <li> Have yet to receive my product dont no whats the hold up but it almost been 1months I keep getting the run around.</li>
    <li> these dotting tools are great they have different sizes. its perfect! plus it was the right price for these tools</li>
    <li> I find these dotting tools great with a good variety but just like everyone else said, some of the points are the same size.</li>
    <li> They are made very well and are professional grade. I am still unsure how to use the tools, but I am sure others will find them useful for nail art.</li>
    <li> surprisingly nice set of marblezing dot pens  I was able to use them comfortably will be returning to buy more items</li>
    <li> i like it very much ,its work well and its beautiful. BTY  its chap lol. i use it make a wonderful nail art!</li>
    <li> To my surprise these were actually great quality. Great deal. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I think I paid like $1.</li>
    <li> i thought the tools would have been taller but not bummed. Overall great, what i was looking for. people should buy this</li>
    <li> There are six different sized tips, as I was expecting from other reviews of the product.  The plastic body and metal tips are all of sturdy construction.  Very happy with my purchase, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I received my first ever dotting tools this week, and as soon as I took it out of the package one of the pieces fell off. It didn&#x27;t cost much so I&#x27;m not complaining, I just dabbed some nail polish so that it acts like glue, and glued it back. It&#x27;s a great starter kit for a beginner like me. Overall, I&#x27;m okay with this purchase, I don&#x27;t think I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love using these with my gel polish. I can make fun polka dot designs and hearts. They are well worth the small amount I paid.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what i want it to do and hasn&#x27;t broken. If the ends fall out, just use a little super glue to out them back in and no worries! I love the different sizes also. I recommend looking up how to use them if you don&#x27;t know though.</li>
    <li> There are so many different sizes, that in can create any nail design!! I love the 10 different sizing choices!</li>
    <li> Amazing deal, this product is a must have and at such an amazing price it won&#x27;t hurt your budget.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools make perfect dots of all sizes. Each end has a different size. They&#x27;re easy to use,nicely made,and pretty to look at</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! NO PROBLEM AT ALL!! :D Thank you!</li>
    <li> These tools do exactly what they are supposed to do! I was excited to get them and also extremely surprised. I ordered them on the 16th of June and completely for got that I had ordered them for myself. To day is the 20th of September! So excited to receive them, not sure if I would order from the seller I got them from again.</li>
    <li> My child is happy now.</li>
    <li> Product was great and very inexpensive! Shipping takes a while but you can&#x27;t expect anything else for how much you&#x27;re paying! So if you don&#x27;t need it immediately this is a good quality tool set! I love it!</li>
    <li> I totally think its amazing i got it for my little sister and she loved it and its good for the price</li>
    <li> I am into doing my nails and needed a new dotting set. The price was great. They work great with nail polish. So glad I bought this set.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful little dotting tools, however the description is misleading - while there are tips on both ends of all 5 pens as seen in the photo, only one side of each varies in size while the other is all the same size ball tip. So in actuality you&#x27;re getting 6 sizes - one of each of 5 and than 5 of the same smallest size. BUT, still a good value and handy tool for the cost if you&#x27;re finding them on the low end. (I spent $1.00ish)</li>
    <li> These will make doing my nails so much more fun. All the different designs I can do with these is gonna be fun</li>
    <li> These dotting pens work really well for nail art! You don&#x27;t need very much nail polish on the pen to make the dot so it&#x27;s pretty efficient...it would be good to put top coat after everything has dried so the design stays longer but other than that, get this product!</li>
    <li> Easy to use for nail art and various arts and crafts. The ease of using these Dotting Pen Sets I have found myself able to use them to design cards with them as well. I would use this company again.</li>
    <li> cheap, easy to use, kid friendly love them i don&#x27;t have to make my girls&#x27;s flowers or stars on their nails anymore ...</li>
    <li> Tips all fell off within a few uses.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and perfect for all levels</li>
    <li> As shown. I received all 5 colors. These are going g to be great for nail art designs. The price was perfect.</li>
    <li> When I go and get my nails done and decide to get some sort of decoration and they charge a fortune.  I bought these for a great price and there is different sizes and they work great.  I always use them on my friends for free!</li>
    <li> They are a bit smaller than they look. But are pretty.</li>
    <li> i really like them now if only i could wear nail polish to work</li>
    <li> Great!! Much easier for me to put rein stones on my nails!</li>
    <li> first of all these tools are very cheap.you can do so many things with them. its a must have if you like to do your nails on your own.</li>
    <li> although the picture shows all pink, they came in a variety of colors. I think the colorful One are almost more fun than just the pink. They work well and so far have not broken or deteriorating anyway.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for these to come in the mail and I&#x27;m actually happier that they&#x27;re all different colors, not all pink. They&#x27;re perfect!</li>
    <li> I love them! They&#x27;re amazing I love all the different sizes. Makes doing nails so much easier. I would definitely recommend getting them.</li>
    <li> These are really great and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat them! Got extras and am going to give them as gifts for Christmas too!</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive and the dotting pen seems pretty sturdy for the price! 5 different sizes on one side, 5 tiny dot sizes on the other.</li>
    <li> This tool is a little harder to master than I thought it would be. It would have been helpful to have instructions or examples.</li>
    <li> wonderful, great condition came before shipping date. I honestly do not know what they are for but my daughter wanted them so I bought them for her</li>
    <li> Love the product but it took forever to get to me! I was waiting a couple of weeks for something I thought I would get in a few days. Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t need the product desperately.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to these. They have 10 sizes of dotting and a little case that they come. They do exactly what i need them to do and that&#x27;s make polka dots for my pedicures. Great purchase and I always recommend these when I&#x27;m asked about my polka dotted toenails</li>
    <li> thank you for this item...my daughter is having fun with this...i just ordered some rhinestones and stickers to add to her collection of nail art accessories...thank you again</li>
    <li> Very happy with these good quality and great price.</li>
    <li> I love these tools. They look just like the ones at the nail shop, mine are a different color then the picture but who cares, love them.</li>
    <li> I am a successful nail technician and work from home meaning I place orders and need otems to arrive asap this item did its job got here qyick and great conditions</li>
    <li> I have recently started doing my own gel polish nails at home and yes I missed the designs so decided to do some myself and these are GREAT! I&#x27;m very glad that I got them and I have checked mine are actually all different sizes except for 2 tips that are the same. So I am very happy!</li>
    <li> I was not expecting much with these, but they&#x27;re not too bad. They make round dots, but if you press with even slightly more pressure than you did with the last dot, they will be different sizes. That&#x27;s annoying. But, overall, good product.</li>
    <li> The product is as shown I just have to learn to use it :)!  I want to add about the seller, they contacted me just to see if I got the package!  I found that so thoughtful and professional.</li>
    <li> these are great! so easy to make great looking nails with these. An amazing value, and they look nice too</li>
    <li> These make nail art designs so easy! I use them all the time to make flowers, swirls, polka dots, etc.</li>
    <li> I know lots of people comment that they are all the same sizes which is true and false. The one side on all of them is the same exact size (probably so you can have similar dots in lots of different colors without having to clean off the dotter between each), but the other side has 5 different sizes. They are also very bright and fun. I love them.</li>
    <li> They work 100x better then toothpicks and the design it cool. I don&#x27;t use them often and bought them specifically for one design that matched one outfit.</li>
    <li> Works well. Their good nail art tools. It&#x27;s just what I expected. I am completely satisfied with this product. Just Awesome!</li>
    <li> these are so cool if you do nails these work perfect without a problem i think they were priced perfect and i would order them again.</li>
    <li> Thought these were actual nail polish dotting pens....&amp;#34;pens&amp;#34; meaning you put nail polish in them to use. What you actually get are 10 of the same metal ball tip sticks that you can dip into nail polish and make dots on your nails...not sure why you would need 10 you can make dots with a cue tip or tooth pick. I don&#x27;t see anything unique about this item at all. Luckily they were cheap otherwise I would have returned them.</li>
    <li> The dotting tools are just as described. I have no complains. Great quality for the price too. I absolutely love them and I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> works great for wax and nail polish great product</li>
    <li> Love these, they are sturdy and easy to clean.  Makes wonderful designs on nails.  Love the different sizes, makes it easier to do my young daughters nails.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excelente el articulo me llego en buen estado y funciona a la perfección!</li>
    <li> Someone previously had said there were I believe 6 different sizes? But when I got mine, there was only like 4.. Because most of them are at least identical in size.. To say the least, these are VERY affordable, I mean who can go wrong with $1.00? :P Not me! So it&#x27;s awesome to at least have 5 dotters and if I ever lost one, I have another to use so I guess there&#x27;s always a use for them at the end of the day. I can&#x27;t really complain, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase overall. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I just love this product I can use them for multi things they are great..makes great designs must have if u do nails</li>
    <li> took a lil while to get here but its great and easy to use. makes my nails look very pretty</li>
    <li> I purchased my dotting tools from Case2 and it shipped from Hong Kong and I got it earlier than the expected arrival!! All the dotting pens are different sizes as well. I&#x27;m so excited to use them!!!</li>
    <li> Great products! They&#x27;re everything they claimed :)</li>
    <li> Every util and nice to use. Easy to Manuel and work with it. I will recommend this product to any body an fir the price wondeful</li>
    <li> These nail pens are not accurate sizes to use at home, also a lot of the point sizes are the sasme.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like these at all, the balls on the ends are different sizes, but I thought they came with design stuff on the inside of the pen. It doesn&#x27;t, you have to pour out some nail polish, dip the ball in the polish and then try to make a design. Too much work.</li>
    <li> Recieved my dotting tools in the mail today, I made a great purchase I do my own acrylics and these are great I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviews meant by they got the same tool over 5 times because ALL of mine have different sizes! ! Guess I was the lucky one because they are all totally different I have really big dots and really small dots they should let pictures be uploaded to show the condition and sizes of things I made a great but at $1.36 &amp; free s/h!! I will be buying from this company again in the future</li>
    <li> My wife uses these all the time to make decorations on her nails. The variety of tip sizes allow for different size dots and designs. She makes some great stuff!</li>
    <li> i just used one of the and already the head is loose.. and  it doesnt draw as well as i thought it would</li>
    <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Alot of different sizes too</li>
    <li> Daughter loves these to do her nails</li>
    <li> The dotting pen set is well packaged. Good assortment of sizes to use. Holding up well so far. Does not hurt that they look cute as well.</li>
    <li> I loved these. Also, the shipping was free! If you enjoy doing your nails, and being creative, these tools can help you accomplish many designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate</li>
    <li> good price for the product</li>
    <li> I love these! It beats using toothpicks and other things to decorate. I have gotten at least 4 throughout the years both as personal use and as presents.</li>
    <li> love to use these music very often makes doing your nails with details really easy to go about a month to get here but so worth the wait</li>
    <li> The dooting tool sizes are all the same and the tools themselves are very small. I will never buy from this seller again because the keep scamming people...</li>
    <li> Very precise. Perfect for nail art.</li>
    <li> Decent, just like every nail dotting tool.</li>
    <li> I still use them after 2 years of having them</li>
    <li> Love them. Work great! Got different colors not all pink. Not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Use them all the time, great product</li>
    <li> I just received these in the mail yesterday! They came a lot faster than expected. They also came in 5 different colors and you do get different sizes with this set. I&#x27;m no nail pro but I just did a flower design on my nails with easy with these dotting tools. I would highly recommend these to anyone who loves doing their own nails.</li>
    <li> For the price these are great love all the different sizes</li>
    <li> Shipping took a very long time but what arrived was very nice dotting tools for far cheaper than elsewhere so it was worth it. It made dotting much easier having a specialized tool. They are incredibly sturdy and well made especially at their price. They were not all different sizes but the amount of variety was still great and useful in my designs</li>
    <li> Excellent tools, makes my work look close to professional status!</li>
    <li> These are great for nail art. Didn&#x27;t take too long to get to me and it came with a lot of tools. Love this!</li>
    <li> for the price, you cant beat these. they do what they need to do and do it well, with any kind of nail paint. the only reason i gave it four stars is that the tips are not all different sizes. yes, they are double sided but you only get five sizes anyway.</li>
    <li> I actually received the multicolored set but they work just like they are supposed to. They feel nice in the hand and give great control making different sized dots and even lines.</li>
    <li> The item wasnt pink, they were mixed colors. The sizes were still the same, but theyre kind of hard to use. Overall, it doesn&#x27;t really matter, it was just the color. But, for the price it was great...... and also its hard to use at first but after a while, its easy.</li>
    <li> amazing set for such price! I use them a lot for my polymer clay creations, I totally recommend this set I&#x27;m so glad I found this!</li>
    <li> They did not all come one color as pictured...they came in multi-colors! That was a pleasant surprise because I really didn&#x27;t care what color they were as long as they did what I want them to do. I haven&#x27;t tried them out yet but they are a good weight...not light or flimsy. I&#x27;ll be trying them out soon!</li>
    <li> Stellar pricing and really useful for crafts as well as nails! I really recommend these, and for the price, grab a couple sets!</li>
    <li> The best pens! They do exactly what they are supposed to. Different sizes and awesome length. most def worth my money!!</li>
    <li> These are exactly how I pictured them to be. All the points of the pen are different sizes so I can have many different size dots. They look sturdy as well.</li>
    <li> One end of the sticks is all one size. I knew that prior to my purchase from reading others reviews. 2 Sticks broke apart after opening package. Cheap, fun to use. I would search for a different brand prior to buying. TIP: these are actually embossing sticks... Michael&#x27;s takes 2 coupons now... use your coupons at Michael&#x27;s for a better deal! ;)</li>
    <li> These are perfect for many styles and easy to use.  I have only used them a few times, but the end results were cute.</li>
    <li> I can not wait to see the amazing nail art that my daughter and I can create using all this fun nail stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Very cute and fun. Liked the product a lot should have bought more, great gifts for girls with like doing their own nails.</li>
    <li> Product was just as stated in the ad. I would purchase again if needed. The items met my expectations completely</li>
    <li> A nice quality for the price!  I would recommend this product to my friends!  I have yet to use them on my nails but I can tell the quality of the product is nice and will work perfect.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery worked great no problems</li>
    <li> Got for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them!  Has already used them.  Made fun Christmas trees on her nails.</li>
    <li> Great for nail art,  purchased 6 months ago..  Still good shape! I wld suggest these to friends &amp; family! Have fun!</li>
    <li> Not really sure what all this is used for, but my girlfriend who I bought them for seems to like them a ton. Constantly using them, so good I&#x27;d say.</li>
    <li> I could not believe the quality of this product. I might need to get another. I love the polka dots I now can put on my nails!!</li>
    <li> They are okay but the picture shows the all pink and they came multicolored. Disappointed. I have to add more words here.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only 5 diffrent tips, the opposite side of the tools are all the same.  It&#x27;s a good deal for the price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great price for all the sizes included in the set and they worked great too! Would recommend ordering.</li>
    <li> Shipping was a bit slow, but the price was right!  Good quality for such a cheap price.  Would recommend product to non-professionals</li>
    <li> These worked great, they seved their purpose and are of great solid quality. the tips are of all different sized so many decorative styles are possible with these!</li>
    <li> I truly loved the dotting pen set. All the sizes you need in one affordable set, easy to use and they work beautifully...what more can you ask for!</li>
    <li> I use these so much when doing nail art. There are so many different sizes...the possibilities for designs are endless lol&lt;br /&gt;They are of great quality.</li>
    <li> Some of the heads are not glued on the pink stick to well. So they come off. If you glue them back they work fine.</li>
    <li> Works but after a few days the dotting part broke off</li>
    <li> Now I can stop using the bobby pin method 😂😂😂, and I just love having these dotting tools, it just makes everything easier for designs, etcetera. Also, it comes with varied dotting tool sizes, which it&#x27;s great. I have no regrets for purchasing this, thank you!</li>
    <li> Worked well for creative nail design.</li>
    <li> Use them for my nails &amp; craft projects!! Great variety of sizes at great price!!</li>
    <li> This product came in sooner then expected and when I got them I was expecting them to be all pink but instead was a variety of different colors they&#x27;re great although on one of the tool the metal part was loose . after all i was happy for what I paid</li>
    <li> excellent great product</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Very cute and work fantastically. Easy to clean, I dont have anything bad to say about them. 1</li>
    <li> Love them and love the designs i can make,</li>
    <li> These are cute little crafty products. They seem to be made of high quality materials, and also come with nifty designs. My nieces are always intrigued by the inner designs every time I do their nails..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come in a multitude of sizes which is even better and give you more freedom in creating nail art.</li>
    <li> My daughter will enjoy using.</li>
    <li> Love these! My kids use them also!</li>
    <li> I love these, I use them all the time. There are several sizes included, they are easy to use and the result is always clean and beautiful.</li>
    <li> These Dotting 5 X 2 Way Marbleizing Dotting Pen Set for Nail Art Manicure Pedicure By Dotting are a must have for doing any kind of nail art.  I was so excited to get these.  I had normally for years been using wooden cuticle sticks or tooth picks and while they do work good, these work so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly could not believe the price and how darn cute they were.  I really love the design inside.  So cute.  They work perfectly and I highly recommend them for anyone wanting to do designs on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorites in my nail kit.

    <li> We love to make lots of designs with these dotting pens. Great girl bonding moment when doing nails together. Fun!</li>
    <li> Nice weight to them just took awhile for them to come but, Overall I am satisfied with the results ok buy over all</li>
    <li> Love tbem i use them all the time. Price was even better. Sbipping took some time but it was fine.</li>
    <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.</li>
    <li> i got all different sizes, which i really liked. matches description and picture exactly, got it quickly also, gave it as a present</li>
    <li> easy to use and very cute after your done , and easy for my 4 year old to use as well without a mess love it</li>
    <li> I love sitting around and doing my nails sometimes, so these are very handy. The tips come in different sizes  an the spiral design is cute.</li>
    <li> i think i use these almost every time i paint my nails! so easy to work with &amp; clean !</li>
    <li> Works great and seem to be sturdy; has graduating size tips. I was elated to have the item arrive faster than I expected. I am going to buy more of this item for gifts.</li>
    <li> These are great but being double sided there aren&#x27;t ten different sizes lol there is about 5 or 6 but they work great for making animals and fun creative designs.</li>
    <li> finally got them. they are as described.. haven&#x27;t used them yet.. they are dotting pens.. what could go wrong right?!</li>
    <li> These nail art pens are great. I&#x27;ve never used one until now, and I dipped an end in nail polish and was able to draw hearts, flowers, and spell words with it right away. They are super easy to use! Very worth the money. I practiced on a piece of paper to get better at it. In no time I will have cute manicures and  pedicures without spending the time and money on going to a spa.</li>
    <li> i love these so very much they work so well i just wish the bag they came in would not have broken but other wise i love this product!!!</li>
    <li> i gave it one star  because the dotting tools are small  and one of them was broken so i would not recommend these tools for nail art .</li>
    <li> I could not wait until these came  they were smaller then I thought that they would be but they work wonderful  thank you</li>
    <li> They work great &amp; it&#x27;s fun to paint all my friends nails and make cool designs! One complaint would be that one of the heads fell off but I easily fixed it by putting hot glue at the bottom and sticking it back in. Other than that, beautiful color &amp; fun to have!</li>
    <li> Only a few of them are actually different sizes but they look pretty great. I wish they had been all different but it&#x27;ll keep me from having to clean too often when using different colors</li>
    <li> I have used a few times now mostly to apply gem art to nails. So far so good cant wait to try designs next</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! I only with that the pens were labels or sized. It too hard to tell which dots are smaller then others. Other then that, no complaints! Great investments.</li>
    <li> I took a star  off because they claimed that there were different sizes on each side but one side on all of the dotting tools was the same. Other than that they work fantastic!</li>
    <li> One side of the 5 dotting tools are all the same. I looked at a different product by a different seller and it looks exactly like the ones I got mine look nothing like the picture showed. So half are not very helpful but the other half are great.</li>
    <li> I would just like to say that these are absolutely wonderful! I ordered these on July 27 and got them July 31st! Upon opening the pouch that the items come in, I could immediately tell that these were sturdy. The design is pretty on these! I got the colorful set and they all come in different shapes and sizes, which is great for different kinds of designs! $2, free shipping, AND only 4 days to get it? I would buy another if I need two!</li>
    <li> Love that I can make some many designs for my nails with these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s came in a promptly manner and I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected, and these are beautiful! Nice and sturdy, good quality for the price. I have yet to use them but I have no doubt in my mind they will work fabulously!</li>
    <li> Metal dotting heads fell out of plastic handles, had to glue them in myself. Other then that just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Nice! Simple and love the different sizes</li>
    <li> Must have, love these.</li>
    <li> I ordered the pink Shany  dotting pen set and got a pink dotting pen set like the pink dotting pen that is pictured with the set that also contains a green, yellow, white, and blue dotting pen. I was really disappointed because the only reasons  ordered  them were for their color and they didn&#x27;t look cheap. They looked really cheap and didn&#x27;t have Shany printed on them.</li>
    <li> All the dots make pretty much the same sized mark. Nothing special...</li>
    <li> These are good for those creative people out there. You can make lots of spade signs with these, but I usually just use them to make lines or circles.</li>
    <li> I like it it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services and i like to give 5 stares</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are absolutely adorable and easy to use! Definitely worth the buy! I got these for a great deal.</li>
    <li> Easy too use. Good quality. Good price.</li>
    <li> i have made hearts, dots, eyes, faces, this is so much fun and my daughter loves it she is able to learn</li>
    <li> Item was NOT as described. Item did not have 10 different shapes - only five.</li>
    <li> I love this dotting pen!  It makes my free hand nail art so much simpler.  It creates perfect dots of different sizes.  The pens are of a nice quality and good price!  I definitely recommend this product.  It exceeded my expectations.!</li>
    <li> This product got here almost 3+ weeks earlier than expected!! Im so happy the dotting tools are cute and serve their purpose. They actually came in individual diffrent colors rather than pink but thats better pinks ehh one of the dotting tools poked through the pouch it came in but overall good:)</li>
    <li> Overall good dotting tool, great price for it as well. Try going to sallys and purchasing this the cost will be pricey</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift to my niece and she loved them.</li>
    <li> Great for nail polish addicts!</li>
    <li> It made the best designs on my little cousins nails! They loved it! They called me the nail polish queen!</li>
    <li> Like it! we cannot find these in America for sell,&lt;br /&gt;I like doing my own nails designs. It came quicker than shipment date. Boy was i the wifey excited. Polka dot toes everywhere lol</li>
    <li> although I have to say it took about three months to get here and did not look like the picture at all I&#x27;m very happy with what I did get five pens blue,orange,white,pink,and green no brand but still the beautiful swirl look the Shany&#x27;s have in the pic.</li>
    <li> These are the same exact tools my American nail girl uses in her nail art. I&#x27;ve seen them for way more in the beauty supply stores. Shipping took close to a month but being that I was in no rush it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some people get annoyed with the slow shipping... for such a small amount of money I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of the pens. I ordered the pink set and that&#x27;s the one I got. As other people have pointed out: only one side of the pens have different sized dots. I think that they offer plenty of options for different designs. Just clean the dotting tool on a cotton ball with some nail polish remover if you&#x27;re using different colors and it will speed-up the process.</li>
    <li> Love them! They are a life saver</li>
    <li> Solid dotting pen. Cute pink dotting pen for nails.  So far so good.  Used it couple times now and it works great for dotting designs.</li>
    <li> I was expectong 5 pinks. But i received the colorful. I guess thats fine. Its  still working great. So useful. Happy to have this. I learn more style uaing this. U should get this sonce most of people hu taught how to do nail art uses these.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are amazing. If you love decorating you nails then these are defiantly for you. The order also came just when it said it would. It was worth the wait!</li>
    <li> When I first received the dotting pens I tried it right away and loved it. It&#x27;s  super easy and fun to use. There are so many things to learn how to make. if your thinking about buying them DO. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I recieved these dotting tools a week before its estimated shipping date.They arrived in a small package with little protectective bubble wrap.I was happy to see they had all made it intact when i opened the padded envelope which they arrived in.After one use the pink dotting tool broke in half and i noticed they were all cracked upoun arrival.Not a bad buy, you get what you pay for,these are great for nail art begginers.They work very well there just extremely fragile after arriving partially cracked</li>
    <li> I love my dotting tools the only thing I would say negatively is that they aren&#x27;t that long so it&#x27;s hard to handle but other then that they are awesome and they get the job done.</li>
    <li> took a little long to get here. but they work grate and they are really cute and I didn&#x27;t pay more then $2 for them...</li>
    <li> The white one, one of the tips just fell out, I went to glue it and it just got all rusty on the inside. It did stay though. I mean they work.</li>
    <li> When I found this product I wasn&#x27;t in a rush to get them. I knew they were shipping from Asia so I knew it was going to be a bit of a wait.. It turned out to be like 6 weeks (felt like 10)!!! The price is amazing but I think I would have just spent a little more and got them locally. The tools themselves were nice and the package was in great condition. I would recommend buying this if you are not in a hurry to receive them!</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are as same as the other dotting tools. It work well and so far none of the tip broke so its great~</li>
    <li> The dotting tools are awesome awesome awesome! There super easy to use, the dots are perfect looking, and maintenance is great as well.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, good quality as well. They came in really fast in the mail and i&#x27;ve been using them a lot. Love them :D</li>
    <li> These are so cute! I would recommend these tools for anyone who wants to try or that does nail designs. They make it a mess free &amp; hassel free experience!</li>
    <li> Dotting tools! oh my. I was so excited to get these because i was tired of making dots out of my toothpicks haha. Now because i dont want any of my orders to have mistakes most always opt for the seller which is fulfilled by amazon. That costed me a few bucks more. The reason why this review is getting 4 stars out of 5 is because I did not get the 5 different colors ( green, yellow, etc..) instead i got a full 5 pack of pinks! and from shany..( which i did not buy from). Now aside from that, the dotting tools i received did have the different sized sizes so i wasn&#x27;t THAT disappointed. I just wanted variety in color. Will upload pic of my tools asap.</li>
    <li> This item arrived on time and the dotting tools are true to the provided photo. The different sizes allow you to get as creative as you&#x27;d like, while doing your nails. I&#x27;ve used them a few times so far and, not only are they good quality, but I keep getting compliments on my nails! I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I use them all the time to make simple designs. They come in different sizes which makes for a great variety.</li>
    <li> I got them and used them on the same day! They are great.. The price was also a great price</li>
    <li> I do not know if they&#x27;ve changed their products around, but when I received my set, I did not notice any duplicate sizes. I am new to nail art and it took a couple of tries, but I was able to create perfect dots soon enough. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> The dotting tools are pretty much what I expected and work very well for me. The dotting ends on mine have five varied sizes, which seems unlike some of the other reviews on here. They are a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my dotting tools! Great purchase :) lengthy delivery but it&#x27;s to be expected coming all the way from China and for the price, I was totally fine with waiting.</li>
    <li> I reeeeeally loved this item! Tok it a while for me to receive but once I got it I have been doing my nails w/ it almost every two days lol! Best investment ever .!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, greater price but they come from Hong Kong so I waited almost 3 weeks. The sizes don&#x27;t vary a whole lot but the biggest one I haven&#x27;t been able to find here so it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> It took a month for these to get to Chicago from Hong Kong, but it was totally worth it especially for the price! I saw some reviews that people felt that they had gotten the same size tools, but I did not. It came with 5 tools and each end has a different size dot at the end so technically you are getting 10 different tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them for nail art but I also use of them as a tool for clean up around my cuticles. Just dip the dot into the nail polish remover, which was nice because then I don&#x27;t have to buy more brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them!</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly, no flaws.10 different sizes and easy to use! Came in 2 weeks and in good condition for the price.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my daughter.  Came in when they said they would.  She is very excited about doing her and her friends nail.</li>
    <li> I can not find any fault to these nail art tools, I use them almost every time I do my nails. Almost everyone doesn&#x27;t believe me when I said I did my own nails and didn&#x27;t go to a salon to get them done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend them. They are cheap, but high quality!</li>
    <li> take a bit long to arrived..but  merchandise are in good condition, expected quality!</li>
    <li> You get a lot more for the price you pay. Very good build quality. Only downside is that they ship it from China and it might take 3-4 weeks to arrive. You just got to be patient. If you need to buy it sooner, choose a USA seller but it&#x27;ll be comparatively pricey.</li>
    <li> Gave it a one star because the picture clearly shows that there pink and the ones I received were different colors</li>
    <li> I ordered pink ones for my roommate as a gift and when I got them they were all different colors. I was slightly dissapointed that they were not what I expected. The metal piece also fell out of 2 of them. So I had to glue them back in. But she really liked them. Not sure if I would buy anything do&lt;br /&gt;Lose from them.</li>
    <li> Shipping time was great! For the price, the quality is really really fantastic! I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for dotting tools! The designs inside them are really cute too! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Got here fast!! Dotting tools do their job :)</li>
    <li> Totally recomend it love it i have more than 2 years with them an they are in perfect conditions great price arive on time love them.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work good but it&#x27;s bearable but I wasted my money on this I don&#x27;t even use it. Also it&#x27;s pretty small it&#x27;s looks big and long like a pencil but it&#x27;s pretty small and hard to hold good.</li>
    <li> I have the same complaint that others have. with the set I got I ended up with the same pen x&#x27;s five. so really I only got 2 different sizes because the pens are identical to each other save for the fact that they are different colors. I like having some extras so I gave 2 of them to my niece (who I was going to buy a whole new set for) and kept 3 for myself. they work great but I wish they would have been all different sizes so I had to buy some brushes too. all in all good deal now I don&#x27;t have to spend extra buying another set for my niece.</li>
    <li> Grandaughter having so much fun with these!</li>
    <li> For $2 my daughter has been using them for a year, can&#x27;t beat that</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools! The sizes are great and I love how they are all different colors. They make very clean dots and they are easy to clean!! So happy I bought them and they are such a great price! You can&#x27;t beat the price. The other dotting tools I looked were way more expensive, not as many sizes and they were wood, which I didn&#x27;t want. If you&#x27;re looking for dotting tools purchase these! THEY ARE AWESOME!</li>
    <li> great tool for nail decorating</li>
    <li> In love now can make perfect designs</li>
    <li> Good quality, I recmended to a friend</li>
    <li> I love mine, but they are fragile, first time I used mine it broke instantly. But the rest worked fine.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> thought they would bigger, but that&#x27;s oaky!!! I still love it</li>
    <li> I would give it 5 stars b/c it works perfectly but its not the color I ordered so I gave it 4</li>
    <li> I love them,, everything I expected them to be, works great, good buy, I would buy again if I had to</li>
    <li> i like them.. they come very handy</li>
    <li> Well made tools for your nail art needs! I love them for dotting, and mixing colors for unique effects.  The plastic handles are super cute too. Great shipping experience.</li>
    <li> Instead of 5 different size dotting pens I got 5 of the same.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loved it</li>
    <li> I love them. They&#x27;re exactly how I imagined they would be. Other people complained how they got the same size. But mines came just as they advertised.</li>
    <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;takes a while lelgar&lt;br /&gt;all were of different size</li>
    <li> Everything I expected it to be, really enjoy using it!!</li>
    <li> Really useful and sturdy, easy to clean, makes beautiful designs. Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very helpful and a great price!</li>
    <li> I havent gotten a chance to use it yet but they are not cheaply made and are a great price. They are so expensive at the store and these are just as nice at a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> A nice variety of tips, only two being of the same size out of the 10 sides available.  A bonus is the pattern of the handles--I primarily paint childrens&#x27; nails, and they stay endlessly entertained just twisting them around while I work!  :)</li>
    <li> I love them n they work amazingly</li>
    <li> When to do it it makes the nail polish come of and it was not worth the time or money</li>
    <li> Great price, do their job.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they would probably break after the first use..However, I was very surprised that these are very well made and I have no doubt they will last a long time!</li>
    <li> One broke first day I got it, but I glued it back together</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are great! They took a long time to get here but they are fun to use. One of the tools broke before I even used it but with super glue it can be fixed.</li>
    <li> these work very well. nicely made.</li>
    <li> These arrived faster than my other orders out of China and they did not disappoint. The dotting pens are nicely made and have a good variety of tip sizes.  They are nicely balanced, light and easy to handle. The attractive colors help me to find the tips I want quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this. It makes beautiful dots and there is different sizes which makes it even better, The colors are pretty too!</li>
    <li> Just as described, speedy shipping!  Thanks</li>
    <li> they seem to be great and work great and they look like they will last me a long time ....:)!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> great dotting tools, the different sizes make it easy to create all kinds of nail art.</li>
    <li> Great Delivery, i had all different sizes. Only negative they did come a loose. Easy fix. I put Gorilla Glue on them and there fine.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased these as tracing &amp; embossing styluses, not nail art tools. They do seem sturdy enough so far.</li>
    <li> We love them.&lt;br /&gt;Def would recommend to anyone that enjoys doing their own nails.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and kid friendly too.</li>
    <li> these are really awesome dotting pens for a great price. they are very durable and easily cleaned. i would deff recommend this</li>
    <li> I received one broken.</li>
    <li> perfect loved it! worth every penny</li>
    <li> they all broke so I was disappointed but they work if you glue them back on. overall it was an okay product.</li>
    <li> I had the tools that were each a different color. I also ended up with six different sizes; five of the ends are the same size. It took forever to get here, but it did arrive within the estimated dates. Can&#x27;t really beat that price, though. Free shipping is free shipping for a reason, I guess. The tools seem sturdy; I don&#x27;t anticipate any problems using them or having them last.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I love these dotting tools! I can create all sorts of cool designs without finding the right sized toothpick, bobby pin, etc.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved it.</li>
    <li> Not as big as I thought but still like them</li>
    <li> I thought they came in pink, but better they came in colors. I use them and never get the sizes confused</li>
    <li> I bought these from an Amazon partner with Prime. It was a little more expensive from them but at least I didn&#x27;t have to wait a month for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item: I got what I expected. They do what they were intended for. However, when rinsing them off after using them with nail polish, I noticed they are rusting from being cleaned off with just water. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed by this since this was a good variety set and I enjoyed using them. Two of my ends aren&#x27;t usable anymore because they pretty rusted now. I thought I dried them  well but maybe I didn&#x27;t?</li>
    <li> I love doing my own nails and these were SO CHEAP! I love that I spend what? A dollar on them and now I can do the flowers that the nail ladies do at the salon! I would give this review a 5 except when I recieved it one of the metal parts keeps falling out of the holder and I&#x27;m gonna need to super-glue it back in. It&#x27;s not big deal just throwing it out there. Good variety of sizes in the ball points too!</li>
    <li> Using for acrylic dot painting on rocks. Excellent product for crafts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a novice beauty buyer and was looking to grow my nail art collection so I bought these dotting tools. They are so cool and the design is absolutely rad! The sizes are perfect for many different kinds of dots. I would recommend these to a friend!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten the items yet. It is taking way too long. I am tired of waiting. This is bad service.</li>
    <li> Awesome sizes and work great!</li>
    <li> Not sure why it took forever to get the set but it was what I wanted after it finally got here</li>
    <li> It took a while to get to me but overall I am happy with the product. I rate 5 stars.</li>
    <li> What a bargin!  I am IN LOVE with my dotting tools and cannot belive I waited so long, plus the great price! People say they are the same tips I think only the standerd size one was doubled, which makes since because you use that one most.</li>
    <li> These tools work great. Very Happy</li>
    <li> These nail pen tools are great for creating all kinds of nail art. Easy to use durable and just like their picture.</li>
    <li> i got her the dotting pens so she live mine a lone but she love them and now i have to buy some for my mother ever good paging came earl so ever happy on it thank you</li>
    <li> Very nice, great quality.  They are heavy and nice.  I thought they would be cheap by looking at the pic of them on site.  Very pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Great sizes, better than expected. The price ins unbeatable and so is the selection. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Their fine I guess I never use them so...</li>
    <li> Great product, will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> Probably have more options than you really need. You can do so much with just one or two of these, so 5 is an amazing deal. Super fast shipping. I&#x27;m loving these! 5 ends are the same, but the other 5 ends are super different sizes so there is lots you can do!</li>
    <li> I loved this product, I bought these to do my own manicures and I love them. They are great and so easy to use. They have different sized dots on each size so you have several different sizes. I can&#x27;t wait to watch some videos on them to find more ideas.</li>
    <li> I do nails and these help me with placing jewels and sparkles on my own nails at home they are easy to use and good quality. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Perfect, as advertised, easy to use, easy to clean. So fun to experiment with even as a beginner.</li>
    <li> I was expecting 10 different sizes for these tools, however, there are only 6 as one side of all of the pens are the same size. But I think that the sizes you do get are adequate for any design you want to make on your nails. With these pens you can make thin lines and tiny - large dots. It would have been nice if the description was more clear though.</li>
    <li> Product was just as advertised, really cheap and worth the buy! The tools are sturdy and well made I am glad I found this when I did! I had been dying for nail dotting tools but everywhere I looked it was just so expensive for just two! Recommended it to all my friends. :)</li>
    <li> Love!  Great service!</li>
    <li> Love them, different dot sizes to accommodate my designs.</li>
    <li> This makes decorate your nails much easier if you ever decorate your nails yourself you need this in your life</li>
    <li> Product as described, perfect for nailart.</li>
    <li> They all came in pink though, not rainbow like the picture. But they do what they&#x27;re meant to do so it&#x27;s fine!</li>
    <li> ah-ma-zing! Wow what an amazing tool! I wish I would have ordered it sooner and I use it every time I paint my nails. I LOVE these tools</li>
    <li> Great buy! I use these all of the time!</li>
    <li> Very good product but it takes a WHILE to ship.</li>
    <li> I love them!! Highly recommended😊</li>
    <li> Nice! Good for nail designs!!</li>
    <li> I have this set and love it. When I saw the price for a penny, I had ordered more and a few for my friends at beauty school. Great service and prices especially when you don&#x27;t pay for shipping!</li>
    <li> Very nice better quality than I expected. Its a steal for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of dotting pens.  I use them not only for nail art, but for my arts and crafts.  I also use them for anything that may need this type of tool - probably some things I shouldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handles fit nice in the hand and I experience no fatigue during or after use.  The only con I can think of is that I wish the dot sizes were more spaced - that is to say it seems like some of them are the same size, but I know they are not.  I could have used two bigger dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product and I would reommend.</li>
    <li> I just got them today. I ordered them October 18th and got them today. China to Kansas in 10 days it pretty dang good!! I agree with some customers about the sizing. The bigger dots are sized differently but the smaller ones are the same. Thats not a big deal to me but thats why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I think they are good and cheap :)</li>
    <li> goes longer than a month and my product has not arrived. was supposed to and had to have come an do not say anything</li>
    <li> You will not believe what you get for the price! I love these! I think they are even glass! Worth it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how cheap this was. it works great, you just brush your polish on the tip and dot. You get salon quality for basically free.</li>
    <li> Have used these twice so far and love them.... Was able to do great detailing with them. What more needs to be said?</li>
    <li> These dotting tools work very well. I love the quality and the design on them. It&#x27;s a perfect tool whether you use them for nail art or clay charms</li>
    <li> They work well, but they&#x27;re poor quality.  One of the tips fell out the first time I was using it.</li>
    <li> I really liked these. they are very great to use if you are looking to have poka dot nails! I am still finding cool and new ideas with these.</li>
    <li> Just used these for my manicure design today and they worked great! The low price makes it extremely worthwhile :)</li>
    <li> i love how the end of each side are all different. 10 different sizes!! other sites sell them with 5 different sizes  and the opposite side of each are all the same size... thats only 6 different sizes. and these are very easy to clean</li>
    <li> Do not buy these............ The arrived broken.........they are alright but broken seriously.........other  than that they are good.......... crazy glued them back together and voila</li>
    <li> I ordered these to try to start nail designs, the sizes do different, slightly, but they do differ! I would recommend getting it, got here before shipment date.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for an unbelievably low price. Before I bought these I had been trying to use toothpicks, pencils, etc. to paint fine details on nails and was never happy with the results. I haven&#x27;t used anything other than these tools since they arrived in the mail, and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with them. I plan to buy a few more of these to give away as gifts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It&#x27;s true that the sizes of the tips don&#x27;t vary that much, but this wasn&#x27;t a negative issue for me. The smallest tip is about the size of a fine-point pen tip, and the largest is the size of a small round seed/bead.)</li>
    <li> For what you pay for the dotting tool looks just like the pic, just took forever for it to come.</li>
    <li> These are my 1st set of dotting tools &amp; I&#x27;m very pleased with this item especially for that low price.. They arrived a week early &amp; the packaging was great... I&#x27;ll add some pictures...</li>
    <li> My daughter has created so many wonderful things with  this product. It is amazing on what one can put on nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my set for about a day now. Like the other reviews say, only one end of each pen is a different size from the others. The yellow one is actually two sizes though. I bought these knowing that, so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed. I used them on my toes to make polka dots, which was challenging because I&#x27;ve never owned a product like this before, but I think it came out ok. The pens are easy to clean with some nail polish remover. So far, I don&#x27;t have any complaints. However, if you are looking for 10 different sizes, this is not the product you want.</li>
    <li> Graciia s s s s s s s s s s s s&lt;br /&gt;Thank Y o uuuuuuuu u u u</li>
    <li> I loved the selection that I received. I can do a lot of different patterns on my nails and they are very easy to handle and use.</li>
    <li> These were nice. When they arrived, one of the tips had fallen off, but no big deal. I simply glued it back on and voila! Good as new. That being said, one side (the &amp;#34;bottom&amp;#34;, as seen in the picture)had various tip sizes while the other side&#x27;s tip sizes were all the same. That being said, the repeated size of the dotter is a fairly good size to repeat, not too large or small, and if one is lazy, then he or she can simply put off cleaning his or her tools. Overall, I am quite pleased. I am giving it four stars instead of five because the tip of one fell off, but as i said, its no big deal. The package arrived quite early, approximately two weeks. Additionally, I quite like the color of the tools themselves.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Not sure why I thought I&#x27;d be the special snowflake who&#x27;d actually get what I ordered when so many others complained about not receiving the correct items from this seller. All my pens have the same end on one side and then two have the exact same end on the other. So, I have two exact same pens and three different tops on the remaining pens.  The price is worth it, I suppose, but I&#x27;m aggravated that I had to wait so long and then my items were wrong anyway.  Buyer beware, I guess.</li>
    <li> Love it very convenient</li>
    <li> so I got my dotting tools 2 weeks after i ordered it which i was ok with bacause this was my first purchase and i think that&#x27;s regular time. but once they got here they weren&#x27;t the ones i ordered. i ordered pink dotting tools but instead i got rainbow colored. that doesn&#x27;t change the dotting tools but still i wanted pink.</li>
    <li> One of the dotting tools broke the first day of use. But fixed it with super glue and heat, looks okay now. It&#x27;s useful for my nails. The price is great. So I&#x27;m not complaining. It may of broke but it was under a dollar. And it was easy to fix.</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price.  I thought that they would be plastic and flimsy, but they are not, they are actually quite heavy.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> They are so great. Love them</li>
    <li> I use the all the time to make different designs perfect for peginners</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this and I recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Great price! I have been using these dotting pens for over a year and they are still working great!</li>
    <li> I love these! i used to use toothpicks to make my fingernail flowers, so these are so nice! Great deal!!</li>
    <li> Love the dotting pens, would love to use them right away. They are a christmas gift looking forward to using them.</li>
    <li> My grandaughter and I do our nails every weekend. This pen set has made it SO easy to have the most unique paint jobs you&#x27;d ever want to see!  I highly recommend getting a set of these if you love being one of a kind!</li>
    <li> I want a set for every girl my daughter buys a present for during the school year.  This set is a beauty!</li>
    <li> They nice but the picture I picked showed them all pink and when I received them they were multi colored.</li>
    <li> These products were bad to me.  It took over a month to arrive and when they did they were broken.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail junkie, and these are a great set of dotting tools. You can go wrong with this set</li>
    <li> They work great, only downside is that they are random and don&#x27;t go biggest to smallest. Other than that they&#x27;re awesome</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend and she loves it. She uses it to make extra cash in her spare time.</li>
    <li> Works well, had no problems. You get what you pay for. Just keep in mind since it&#x27;s coming from china it will take a while to get there. So remember that before you give less stars for how long it took to ship.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 3 stars.  This product wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was but will work.  If you can wait a while, I would recommend this seller and the product.  It took a while to get to Georgia.</li>
    <li> but i will be giveing this to my nail tech she will love it just like i will love them used on my nails</li>
    <li> thought by the pic the handles would be diffent colors but they were all pink. oh well they still do the job.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here but Is amazing and worth the price 100%! I gave this to myself as a birthday present :)</li>
    <li> I love these pens! Does the job and the end result is great! the pens are made very well high quality and are very pretty</li>
    <li> i love doing my nails and this makes it a lot easier. it makes perfect circles and they come in all sizes!</li>
    <li> I do nail designs and these dotting pens make all the difference. They are beautifully designed and work great! I would reccomend them 100s over. You cannot beat the price for this kind of quality.</li>
    <li> The reviews for this were good so I took a chance and ordered it as a stocking stuffer for my 17 year old daughter.  She can&#x27;t figure out how to use them.  The pictures posted looked fun and easy but it&#x27;s just not working for her.  Most likely will wind up in the trash.</li>
    <li> If I could add a photo I would. These make perfect polka dots or center dots for flowers. Fantastic for any nail art enthusiast! I love them!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent timing, was shipped 4 weeks early. Only bad comment is one of them came with a broke point lucky I don&#x27;t use that size!</li>
    <li> I got my set yesterday and began using it right away. I LOVE it! I got exactly what I wanted and in new, perfect condition. I also got 10 different sizes, so I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Daughter wanted these to do her nails.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s been using them for 8 months now so I think they&#x27;re a winner. At least her nails look it!!&lt;br /&gt;Plus how can you go wrong for a $2 investment?</li>
    <li> I love them. They work perfectly!</li>
    <li> I ordered this expecting pink and I ended up with multi-colored tools. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I love these! I love to do my nails and make designs on them and these are perfect and really cute!</li>
    <li> Amazing item! Better than expected! I am a traveling nail artist (so I carry my entire salon around in a box), and these pens are perfect for what I needed! Will purchase again from seller in future, awesome experience!</li>
    <li> I love them they make beautiful dots and more!!! 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so far and it seemed to work well.  Once my eight year old realizes we have that, I will be using it a whole lot more!</li>
    <li> If you have time to sit and do your nails for a long time, they are good. This is a product I would recommend to someone who has some experience in manis.</li>
    <li> super cheap, cool tool for people who love doing nails. i only gave 3 stars because it takes several weeks to ship from hong kong. if there was an option for the same product that was made in america, i would pay a lot more for it... this was basically pennies and i&#x27;ll be honest that i feel uncomfortable because it was probably made in a sweat shop :-(&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I really think this is a quality product and I would buy it again. Really good!! Loved IT! So happy I got this!</li>
    <li> worth every penny dont waste your time using anything else just buy them you wont regret it. they take a bit to get to you,but worth the wait</li>
    <li> Ordered my 5 nail art dotting pens on Wednesday, received them on Friday. And for the price, definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY DOTTING TOOLS!!!!!! Thank you soooo much. They make my nail art a lot more easier. :) can&#x27;t wait till the holidays so I can make more nail arts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve played with these a few times and have created some fun designs. I do really love them I think they are a great investment for someone who is looking to spice up their nail art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products came as pictured and they clean well. Easy to use and maneuver. I recommend them and they are super cheap but the quality is there, it don&#x27;t get no better than this!</li>
    <li> Thanks for these tools I just got then today. These are fort sister and she loves them. I thank you for that. But my only problem is the shipping that took really long to get here. Other than that it&#x27;s ok. Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on my nail art. There are so many different designs that you can use these tools for. Love the diffent sizes</li>
    <li> This product was all it said it would be. I love the nail tools! The heads come in different sizes.</li>
    <li> my daughter loved the product so much we bought my niece the same one for her birthday! Creative and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are great. Work wonderful. One side on each is the same on all 5 sticks. You don&#x27;t get 10 different sizes. Great for price. Delivery on time and come in case.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the pens contained&lt;br /&gt;color to be applied to the nail.&lt;br /&gt;They are just pens.</li>
    <li> I agree with all of the other reivews... mine are exactly the same size, unlike pictured.  It&#x27;s helpful if you are doing multiple colors and want the same size dots, but I really wanted different sizes &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I thought they&#x27;d all be the same color but they&#x27;re five different colors. Also one end of all of the are the same size so that&#x27;s a bummer. I thought I&#x27;d get 10 different sized dots.</li>
    <li> - Ordered in pink , came in different colors which didn&#x27;t bother me any ; I like the dotting tools a lot : but downside when opening package one dotting tool was broken &amp; didn&#x27;t come with all sizes as shown above.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good product and on amazon it&#x27;s pink but when I got it, it was all different colors!! I was amazed and all of you out there should try getting this. (Girls)</li>
    <li> It is great. I got the colorful ones not just one color. I used it right away and it works great.</li>
    <li> To start with im so happy I purchased this item. It makes dotting my nails so much easier..Although the item took a month to get here, and when received on of the pen tips was broken off. Still useable though so 4 stars.</li>
    <li> From the photo and description I was expecting several different colors - so was disappointed that I only got one color - pink.  I have no idea how to use them and there were no instructions at all - hopefully my granddaughter will know, I bought them for her.  These were and \\&quot;add on\\&quot; item, so I didn&#x27;t spend much for them or I would be MUCH more irritated.  I know several others have complained about the variety of tips - didn&#x27;t even notice that and they are wrapped under the tree now.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on them again.</li>
    <li> always trying to buy a dotting set for nail, but couldn&#x27;t find it at any beauty product store. i am happy to found it online. very good quality.</li>
    <li> Although we haven&#x27;t actually tried the tools yet, I am disappointed that the tools I received are all one color, i.e., pink, even though the description says &#x27;multiple colors&#x27; and the picture shows five different colors.  I gave it three stars because the colors are not as shown.</li>
    <li> They told me this was going to take or a month to get here but it came a week later.it has a lot of different points and it works good</li>
    <li> These are fun and colorful and a must have for any girl who likes doing her own nails. They arrived quickly and were just as advertised. They appear to be fairly well made and with proper use would last a long time. great find and good seller</li>
    <li> My 5 set ended up being all pink, however, I don&#x27;t mind that. It looks better on my set that way. I am not sure if they are supposed to be all different size dotting balls but I did get 3 different sizes that I can tell and I have been using them daily. Easy to clean and sanitize. I recommend this to all nail technicians and nail enthusiasts.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are easy to use with a nice variety of sizes, and they feel like good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I havn&#x27;t tried them, but my girls are loving them.  They can create a lot of unique nail designs really quick.  They do dots, lines, squiggles, flowers and any picture they think they can create....much cheaper than at the salon.</li>
    <li> I just love this set! From cleaning excess polish to designing, it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Really worth for the price! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I love these handy little dotting tools.  The make nail designing so much more simpler.  There are 5 dotting tools with 2 tips (one on each end) in all different diameters.  I absolutely love using them when im creating the dot in dot effect.  I would totally reccommend these handy pens to everyone.</li>
    <li> These little babies are perfect for simple dotting manicures. For just a couple of bucks, you cannot beat this deal! Yes, there are only really 6 different sizes (all of them have the same size on one side, and different sizes on the other), but still, awesome.</li>
    <li> I started playing around with painting nails on a whim and ended up absolutely loving it. These are so reasonably priced pretty much anyone can afford them. And the end result is beautiful artsy nails! c:</li>
    <li> While the product did arrive within the estimated time it took a month to arrive. But I got all the colors and sizes correctly and they seem sturdy to me. Great for the price I payed.</li>
    <li> These work great and are very pretty! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> First of all, I must say that I really disliked there was no tracking info on this. With a arrival estimate at nearly a month away I would have liked to see where this was and make sure it was headed my way. They just arrived today in a tiny little package. I took them all out and inspected them thoroughly. First I gave all of the ends a gentle twist and a pull, only one end was loose, but it took more than a gentle pull to get it out, so I am not worried. The green and blue dotting tool are exactly the same. They all seem to have one similar end but the rest are different. So I am sad to report that yes you are getting 6 and not 10 different dots. These were really inexpensive when I bought them, so I don&#x27;t feel I got ripped off because I still have 5 sturdy dotting tools, and the dot that was repeated will probably be the one I use the most of anyway. In general, I am really happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These are great. With a steady hand and light touch you can get the most flawless dots however there is no need for some of them because some of the middle sizes makes the same size dots as the larger tools and some of the smallest sizes make dots the same size as the mid-sized ones so it&#x27;s hard to gauge which ones to use sometimes when 3 of them pretty much are redundant. I&#x27;m glad to have these though.</li>
    <li> Shipping very slow for small package, but the product is great overall, the pens all do have different sizes, very sturdy and heavy, so they cant easily break. Thank you</li>
    <li> They are very good for decorate your nails! Super excited to use them!&lt;br /&gt;Like like like like like like like!</li>
    <li> Very handy...good priced!</li>
    <li> im not super happy with it! to begin with it took longer then it said to arrive which is no big deal i guess since i didint really need it however it says you will get different size and you really dont... its prety much all the same size just diff color</li>
    <li> Wow, I ordered these on October 10th and they were slated to come between November 5th-26th and they came NINE DAYS after I ordered them (over two weeks BEFORE they were supposed to come)!  I was so surprised to get them in my mailbox!  I haven&#x27;t used them, but they feel like perfectly fine construction and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!  Oh, and the swirls in the center are really cute.</li>
    <li> This tool holds up great and is great to use for nail art. I have been using it for months and I love it.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for home use to add to a regular manicure or pedicure. They are both stylish and functional and I would recommend them to anyone looking to amp up their typical home nail look!</li>
    <li> Very low price - some are the same tools but can&#x27;t complain. Easy to use and make cute dots for my nails.</li>
    <li> First it arrived within a week of ordering! Second the quality for such a cheap price is awesome. Cant wait to stet using them.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality, I&#x27;m very excited to use these. Took about 3 weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, I received the product before the schedule date. Thanks</li>
    <li> For my crafting needs also, thanks for the fast ship, I really liked the wands, they help when doing intricate work.</li>
    <li> really like these dotting pens it make designing my nail fun and easy and less mess when I use these pens</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are cute and fun to us for designing nail art.  I love there colors in identifying the size of each ball.  I received them in days after placing my order.</li>
    <li> I use these only when I am in need of perfectly shaped dots on my nails, but when I do, they work perfectly. Shipping took forever though.</li>
    <li> I totally loved the product. I can&#x27;t go wrong with what you pay for with the Dotting. It&#x27;s fun and easy doing my nails now. I received them as promised.</li>
    <li> These Dotting Tools Work Good They&#x27;re Soppose Too Do What They Do. Good Conditons</li>
    <li> These are the best things ever AND they are super cute! There are several different shapes to work with. They look exactly as pictured. Did take awhile to get here though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting dotting tools for a while now but I didn&#x27;t want to pay to much for them and found these here great value!</li>
    <li> These work very well and worth the money.  They have different size dotter on each end so you have 10 different sized dots.  I have seen the same product in sally beauty supply for alot more.  Would re buy</li>
    <li> Loves these tools. They do exactly as the seller advertised. My daughter and I love doing our nails and these worked perfectly by creating lines, dots, zig zags, etc... would be a great basket or stocking stuffer idea.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth getting! Some look like they are the same size but the quality is good and it does the job! They also come in different colors! So don&#x27;t expect all pink ones!</li>
    <li> I never ever recived it...it was horrible I message the people and still nothing. .I should never ever purchase nothing. ..It won&#x27;t get sent to you the lie..saying it be here but never got it and its been a month...</li>
    <li> I LOVE these tools -- they make designs on your nail super easy to do and they are a cute and fun color. I like the variety in the pack from really small to really large. Overall great!</li>
    <li> If you enjoy designing intricate nail painting patterns, these tools are terrific. They are great for dots, marble patterns and many, many other designs.</li>
    <li> These were great! I loved using them. The dotting tools are perfect to use for nice, neat, round circles. Just make sure to clean off the nail polish once you&#x27;re done! There are different sizes of dots, too.</li>
    <li> Eh.  Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but it&#x27;s a pain to get polish on them from the bottle.  I have to tip the bottle to get a good amount of polish on them and then they get all polish.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these dotting tools. They&#x27;re very nice and useful and pretty to look at. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and use it very frequently and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it so far. All sides were different sizes and I&#x27;m super happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. I had it for about a year and one of the tips fell, just one. But it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price, just what I was looking for and love the variety of sizes it comes with! Perfect for personal just or in the nail salon!</li>
    <li> This product is cheap in price and is simple to use. I have had so many complements on my nails that they look professionally done. Great shipping too.</li>
    <li> great specially for the price,&lt;br /&gt;easy to use, yo learn how to use it, just youtube, learn and apply, ,</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter with a bunch of other nail stuff for Christmas. She loved it! she did her nails with al kinds for stripes and rhinestones for New Years. Great product and inexpensive.  These dotting tools come in different sizes for what ever you want to do. Nice feel to them, not too heavy and not too light. Overall well made. make sure to order at least a month in advance to get it on time. shipping from overseas and it took for ever to get but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong with five nail styling pen things for $2. They make an awesome girl-gift. Go for it.</li>
    <li> When I first got these I could not stop doing dots on my nails of course the excitement has gone now but I must say this was a good buy. Oh and they are very strong I&#x27;ve had them for a bout five or six month I think.</li>
    <li> at first I bought these for myself, I loved them so much I bought another set as a prize for a nail art contest im having</li>
    <li> Nice i got them in time, but three of them are the same size. But for the price is nice. Im happy</li>
    <li> So I just got this maybe a few days ago and I really like it so far. It hasn&#x27;t broke or anything yet so I guess that&#x27;s a good thing. :)</li>
    <li> I love this product so much!  I am always painting my nails and painting others nails and they always ask if i can make dots.Ever since i bought this I never regretted it.What i love abot it is that inside the package it comes with a little note saying &#x27;&#x27;Suprise!&amp;#34;.If anyone claims this product is awful,ignore it its Amazing!!!</li>
    <li> the tools were great for the low price and shipping was fairly quick regarding the distance... however, I find with these dotting tools it&#x27;s pretty hard to make evely sized dots. the first dot comes out huge and the next come out tiny or with strange dents in the middle. either way, it was cheap so it was worth it.</li>
    <li> 3 of the tips are almost exactly the same size. Some tips were loose in the handle. Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> I like this set however I have had to glue in a few of the tips because they were not staying in the handles. A small price to pay for the price so I can deal with that. The tips are nice and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> very useful, practical and work well. has good grip, appears to be resistant, variety of the pointer is ideal for various decorations. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just receive this today...came from Hongkong...it took almost 3 weeks to a month...but hey it was so cheap and free shipping too..it came nicely package...product looks great...i have not tried it yet...but I am so excited that it finally came..the seller included a thank you card which was nice..i would recommend it to anyone..and would buy it again</li>
    <li> I really like these. It took a little while to receive them, but they were worth the wait! I used them last night and that make great dots on my nails. They do not seem cheaply made, they are sturdy. I love the colors. I only wish that the metal part was a little bit longer to reach into the nail polish bottle. I kind of have to put it into the bottle and tilt the bottle sideways so that the polish gets onto the tip. Overall, I am satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> bought them about 2 years ago and until now i still have them, great prodcut love them. they work great</li>
    <li> It does the work right i just love it....i have being using it very often n all my frnds get amazed</li>
    <li> Would be a good product but you do get what you pay for! The metal tips fell off 2 of them before I even used them!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I loved that they were different colors and colorful, when I received mine they are all one color and there isn&#x27;t any directions on how to use them or tips for making designs. Thank goodness there is youtube videos. If they came the colors shown and with some kind of how-to directions i would give it a 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The only reason why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the plastic handle is too wide for some of my nail polish bottles so I have to manipulate the bottle so the metal tips can reach the polish inside the bottles. I wish the handles tapered in or the metal parts were a little longer to help with this problem. However, considering the price, it is really worth the little I spent. I love it! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it was inexpensive and I liked the design on the actual tool. It was delivered SO FAST. I ordered March 2nd and it came in today March 13th, very happy about that. My ONLY problem and the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I thought they(the tips of the set) were all different sizes. They&#x27;re 5 double sided pens and I counted 5 different sizes thinking there would be 10 different sizes. All in all, Im happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> it came before the actual due date very pleased, its not cheap and very sturdy product i am very happy</li>
    <li> these are cool, but they do have some issues with the silver ends popping out of the glass holders.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the glass holders break. I know that&#x27;s obvious but I&#x27;m just putting it out there.</li>
    <li> I love them especially how easy it use to make designs....i didn&#x27;t get the pink ones I ordered, but I am still happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I love these they are so much fun and such pretty colors! Great deal for the money I paid! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Gave as a gift and recipients loved it.  Asked for more.  May have to get some for myself too.</li>
    <li> these pens work great. i gave them to my daughter and she used them right away. i would recommend them to anyone wanting to play around with making designs on your nails. :)</li>
    <li> packaged well.  received quickly.  seems to be a good value for the money.  have not used, but look way better than a dollar store version.</li>
    <li> This works great. Dots and swirls of all sizes. Daughter getting good at nail art, these are good tools for her to use</li>
    <li> Great kit for creating lots of different designs.  Can get very small details that still stand out.  Easy to hold in hand.</li>
    <li> they make really nice designs i like the various sizes you get perfect for everyday people too not just for proffesionals.</li>
    <li> The tools were very good quality, but came in different colors than shown in the picture. The colors were nice however.</li>
    <li> im having so much fun with these dots making desing almost ever day... and love the fastthat i got them fast</li>
    <li> I love these colorful dotting tools to do my nails.  I have used them so many times.  I have made santa hats, easter eggs, not only on my nails but my grandaughters nails also and she is 5 years old.  I like the veriety of the sizes of the dots that you get.  The price was wonderful.  Will purchase these again if I need to</li>
    <li> This is my second set i am getting as a gift for a friend. I love mine they work great and are even cute. took a while for mine to get here but all in all i love them.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and arrived long before I expected it. FOR PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN THAT THEY ARE ALL THE SAME SIZE: ONE END ON ALL THE TOOLS IS THE SAME. THE OTHER END HAS VARYING SIZES. MY PRODUCT WAS PERFECT.</li>
    <li> If you love nail art these are a must have. You dont receive 10 different sizes but the other side of the tool is the same in all 5. Any way great for the price.</li>
    <li> I have a renewed interest in painting my nails after buying these pens. They are a lot fun and pretty easy to use and clean. The product was shipped pretty fast.</li>
    <li> These are great dotting tools, I know there are really only 5 sizes, BUT considering the price paid, they are great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to superglue one of the tips, however this was such a minor thing. They are neat to look at, arrive nicely packaged in their own plastic case(reminiscent of a pocket protector ;-)) and do the job...what more could you want?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because of the price, I am just fine with my 12yr old using them with her friends, although they seem pretty indestructible outside of maybe being stepped on-which is avoidable thanks to the bright colors ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had them for a couple weeks, they&#x27;re awesome. I use them for nail art, but also to clean up extra polish on the sides of my nails :)</li>
    <li> they work but u have to keep constantly redoing the dotts i still like it thow  and i like how it has alot of sizes</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools! Shipping wasn&#x27;t long(: they all work perfectly! I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it. Thank you for and easy transaction and a great buy(:</li>
    <li> these make the perfect dots for your nails, I also use them for picking up my rhinestones. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Most of mine broke the metal tip came off so was a bit upset but not bad for the price</li>
    <li> I love these.  My first actual nail art tools and I can see myself using them constantly.  They took quite a bit to arrive but I had been warned that it would take a while when I made the purchase so I have nothing to complain about.  Everything came as they&#x27;re shown in the picture and I can&#x27;t be happier with what I&#x27;ve got.  I do really like the swirl design inside the hard plastic (acrylic?) and the metal is easy to clean once I&#x27;m done decorating my nails.  Some of the tips (2 I think) are way too similar in size for me to distinguish and some of the other ones, even though they different sizes, have such a minute difference I can&#x27;t really understand why they bothered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do love them though, and for the dollar I paid for them I&#x27;m extremely happy I bought them and have zero complaints.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, colorful, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dots are the in look on nails this year- for this price I can be trendy</li>
    <li> Love the array of colors and the different sizes of the dots. Arrived earlier than expected and looks sturdy enough to do the job.</li>
    <li> easy to use can use them for other things as well. different size pen set for different size rhinestones. thanks.</li>
    <li> I love these, not to mention the price. I was looking for some at the beauty supply stores and the cheapest I found was $20. Don&#x27;t hesitate to get these.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the reviews before I bought these, seems like it just depends on what brand of dotting tools you get. I received pink dotting tools and all different sizes. Maybe I lucked out, idk, but it is easy to say they are all the same size on one end. The larger dots are very close in size. Anyways, love them, thanks &amp; just what I needed to do all the nail art my daughter desires!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves experimenting on my nails with this dotting set.  It has such a unique look to the.  It was a great product, had great price and fast shipping - couldnt ask for more.</li>
    <li> Love them now I can do my flowers and lil dots on my nails much easier when doing nail art.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools make it soo easy to do different nail designs. They are easy to grip and simple to use.</li>
    <li> Received in excellent condition.  Although I was hoping to receive some type of paperwork with directions, I did not receive any, but my daughter was well pleased.  So I am pleased.</li>
    <li> they are good but the only thing is if you need this item in a rush please buy somewhere alse because they take from 3 to 5 weeks to arrive</li>
    <li> Must have for home nail kit! Quicker shipping than expected :)</li>
    <li> Does not work that well. Very hard to get the dots to go right. Although when they do work they are really cool.</li>
    <li> There was a time I did so much polka dot on my nails because of these tools, that I was begged to do something else. I love it and use it weekly.</li>
    <li> I got these and they were all pink. The only other thing that bugs me is the strap broke on the plastic case they came in, so I can&#x27;t close the flap right. I didn&#x27;t have the problem of all of one side being the same size. Maybe two are, but maybe I just can&#x27;t tell their difference apart. But there are definitely 9 different sizes in mine. They do exactly what I need them to do and I&#x27;ve already made holly for Christmas and fireworks for New Years, both came out great! I love how much easier they make doing intricate designs, much better than toothpicks.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to create fancy nails, this was the answer to help her add all those special finishing touches. Thank you!</li>
    <li> the product is great and its good for the price! they were a gift and my sister loved them! im glad i got them for her</li>
    <li> These things create perfect polka dots and are really good for almost any nail art design. Be creative with these. They are worth every cent and I absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> i love these, work great!!!!!</li>
    <li> Granddaughter will love and they are so much fun and funky.  Know she will have a great time while doing her nails, her mother&#x27;s nails, her friends nails.......</li>
    <li> You can use these for anything. I use these for nail designs and they really come in handy. Some of the tips werent secured in place so i super glued them so they wouldnt come out.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across these tools while looking for a gift for my daughter, who is really into to nail art.  Much easier to paint designs on the nails with these tools, and a great price.</li>
    <li> I love making different size dots on my nails. So these different size points work GREAT. Learning a lot of different designs.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my grand daughter to add to her kit for her apprentiship. She likes the style and the color which matches another part of her kit.</li>
    <li> These pens are amazing! I love how I can design my nails with them so easily. The set doesn&#x27;t come with many different sizes but for the price I paid, having them is so worth it!</li>
    <li> These tools are a lot of fun for someone who wants to add some design to their nails.  They are easy to use and create professional looking nails while also being easy to clean.  I really love this product, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> It came two days after my early due date&lt;br /&gt;There was 5 different sizes I&#x27;m kind of dissatisfied with this product</li>
    <li> It does its job and the price was right. The handle design and colors are really nice.  I like that it has different colors so you can associate the color with point size. Would have been perfect if it had 10 tip sizes but this was still a good purchase.</li>
    <li> My dotting tools arrived in perfect condition. I had all different colors and dotting sizes. I&#x27;ve already done several designs with all of them. Excellent quality for the price I paid :)</li>
    <li> For something that costs so little, it is amazing!  I think you will love the choice between 10 different sized dots for your nail art designs.  Can&#x27;t be beaten for less than 2 bucks!</li>
    <li> Loved the set. I would recommend this set to anyone doing nail art...thanks for the good tools of our trade!!!</li>
    <li> These work well, but 2 of my 5 broke within minutes of using them. The plastic was almost shattered near where the tips were set, and the tips fell off and broke. Luckily, there are 2 sides and they are still usable. For the price I paid they aren&#x27;t bad, but I would have paid more for them to be made a little better.</li>
    <li> These make doing dots SOOOO much easier and they look really great! I&#x27;m so glad i purchased them. It took quit awhile to get here as i&#x27;m in the USA but for the price I def didn&#x27;t mind and the customer service is good too</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m new at decorating my own nails and have seen these in YouTube tutorials... Found these bought them and absolutely love them. Wish I could upload pictures of what these have helped me accomplish. Worth the money. To me if you look close in the picture you can tell the bottoms are all the same size so there isn&#x27;t 10 different sizes but still this is a definite buy</li>
    <li> Ok so they came way fater than i thought ! i was so excited to get these! they are not what i thought though they are pretty much all the same stick , BUT hey i paid like $2 for it . came in good packaging also</li>
    <li> I love the dots I can make on my nails and in different sizes! It opens the door to a lot of nail design possibilities!</li>
    <li> Thank you I loved it just came in today excited to use it looks in very good condition and come on time</li>
    <li> I love using these marbleizing dotting pen set for nail art manicures. I recently used the product on my daughter she loved the dots. Overall great product and cool designs</li>
    <li> This item arrived within 3 days of ordering and I choose standard shipping!! This made me very happy and I love that these can be used in various ways, I use them every time I do mine and my daughters nails!!</li>
    <li> I finally got these tools! I understand that it comes from China so it does take a while. And it actually came before the suggested date of arrival. I just got impatient. lol These tools are awesome. You can do so much with them! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love inanimate objects, but I really like this. I would recommend to anyone who asked. I use these quite often. The colors of each are pretty as well.</li>
    <li> so one end of them are same size but my daughter uses and like them . they are cute colors and what do you expect for such a cheap price? they are better than the ones in our discount stores so it&#x27;s fine</li>
    <li> I guess all these are good for are making dots, as that&#x27;s all I have accomplished with them, works great for dots tho</li>
    <li> Why pay a fortune for expensive dotting tools when you can buy these and they&#x27;re perfect! I love them no complaints here!</li>
    <li> The only con is that one of the metal pieces fell out the on the second use, but a little super glue fixed it.</li>
    <li> Each pen is double sides and all have different sized dotting utensils.great value. Shipped quick for the expected date I was given</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools. They come in a pack of five, but there are actually 10 dotters (one on each end). The diameter ranges in size from large to extremely, almost microscopic, small. LOL Anyway, they arrived much more quickly than expected, the price was very reasonable compared to what I&#x27;d have to pay for ONE dotting tool locally, and I didn&#x27;t have to take time to go to a store to get them. It was a WIN WIN situation. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Initially I ordered a set and one of the pens was broken. I wrote to the company and they immediately sent a new set to me which was perfect! I really enjoy my dotting tool and its working great. Cool item for nail freaks!</li>
    <li> I love them, they work great most def worth the money! They are just as good as expensive ones! I&#x27;d recommend them</li>
    <li> This dotting pen set for nail art manicure is a brilliant addition to your home kit for professionally manicured looking nails. You will love the possibilities it offers.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my little sister who is getting into designing her own nails. I chose this one because the others I saw were 10-15$  for one tool! Afterwards I realized this shipped from Hong Kong. It came within 2 weeks which is the average time any amazon shipment takes for us. We were happy with this time frame because it was estimated at 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the tools.... it came as described. 5 tools - each tool has one standard dotting size and the other side of the tool ranges in sizes by color. They are very pretty and arrived in good condition. It comes in a little pouch that we find convenient to store them in. For less than $3, I though this was perfect! I would order this item again for sure and I would purchase from this seller again as well (amtopseller).</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools. Everyone is right though...one end has the same size tips on all dotting pens, but I&#x27;m still happy with what I got.</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools! They work great and the variety of sizes are great also!</li>
    <li> These are fun to fancy up your nails.  They are 5 different sizes so creativity is definitely possible.</li>
    <li> I thought they were going to be different sizes, they weren&#x27;t. 3 were the same</li>
    <li> My daughter and g. Daughter loved these</li>
    <li> I bought them to try my own design on my nails. It&#x27;s kinda hard to get a even circle on your nail, so i don&#x27;t know if there is a special way to use them. I&#x27;m still working on making a perfect circle.</li>
    <li> The picture shows multiple colors and they all arrived in pink but other than that they work great.</li>
    <li> I said this was just okay because I still haven&#x27;t mastered the art of using them yet.</li>
    <li> Nifty! Good quality! Get what you pay for! Worth it</li>
    <li> While one side of each pen, are the exact same size dots, the other sides are different. They go from teeny tiny, to very large. I use them every other week, and I am very impressed</li>
    <li> item as described, i loved them</li>
    <li> These have gotten me started on nail art, and I do not know what I&#x27;d do without em! they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
    <li> Everything you expect in a dotting tool. Various sizes for ultimate look. Took forever to arrive, but worth it. Highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> This was a great savings~  I am using these for crafts! They are a little on the cheap side (made) but that is ok~</li>
    <li> Never received  they canc order . So sad ,had already brought other things to go with these as a theme gift, I wish they could of told me sooner that they could not get them</li>
    <li> Shipping was supper fast but I was really disappointed that they started to fall apart as soon as I took them out of the package. The glue that held the tips in wore off,causing them to fall apart. I wasn&#x27;t unhappy with my order. They are extremely cute, just that they had fallen apart before I could even use them.</li>
    <li> Got 3 sets of these for my teen daughters.  They love these. Made well and work perfectly. At this price with free Shipping it cant be beat. Received 4 weeks after ordering. :D</li>
    <li> Works great I had a problem with one of them breaking but I just glued the end back in but I love the price</li>
    <li> Was hesitant at first based on some reviews that people said they were cheesy. Well I&#x27;ve used them about four times and have owned them about six months and nothing has gone wrong. They are perfect!</li>
    <li> I was kind of iffy about ordering from the site since it was being sold for such a good price. And my friends sometimes get things from other amazon sellers that are not what are said to be. But I was so happy that exactly what was described is what I got. And YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT THE PRICE!!!  Great product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. What can I say. They make round dots... Theirs only 6 sizes tho. Kinda misleading. On All of them one side is the exact same. On the other size they increase in size.</li>
    <li> I love my dotters. I like that it has different sizes. They are easy to grip and has a cool swirly design. Great purchase and a must have.</li>
    <li> Ive made some very cute designs with this but I will admit when I first got these it took a lot of practice to perfect and sometimes involves a lot more time than Id care to take</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get why everyone is complaining about not having more variety of sizes but i think it&#x27;s fine. There&#x27;s enough&lt;br /&gt;dotting tools in different sizes and i love it!</li>
    <li> All pens had different ball sizes so I am grateful for that.  My only qualm is I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to the fact it would take 6 weeks+ to arrive.  Finally arrived in a tiny package and works just fine.  Creating Easter Eggs today!</li>
    <li> These are the first nail art tools I have gotten and am so happy I did. It lets you dip your toes into the world of nail art with something easy and simple: dots! From dots you can go from there and make flowers and many other cute designs. Very happy!</li>
    <li> My 15 year old daughter got these for Christmas last year and has been dazzling us with her professional looking nails ever since.</li>
    <li> getting for stocking stuffer ... don&#x27;t know how they will work yet...they look good and feel good...hope my DNL likes them!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these tools! I use them almost everytime I do my nails. You get five and they are double ended. Which means you get ten different sizes of dots! one of the ends is a marbaling tool! which is always helpful, along with the very largest end which is perfect for making big dots,cirlces, faces etc! I love them and would suggest buying these especially for the price!</li>
    <li> When I was getting into styling my own nails- I got these. There Great honestly. I think if they would have arrived faster it would have been better.. But I am still using these when I paint nails for others and it really does help when doing design.</li>
    <li> These things are cool. I&#x27;m still learning how to use them but just making dots are so easy now. Easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> I have been doing all kinds of experimenting with these tools ever since I got them in the mail!! GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this thing and loves it! She uses it all the time on herself and our girls. Yay!</li>
    <li> they were cheap and awesome for making really cute nail art designs I use them on kids a lot they are easier than brushes</li>
    <li> I use these all the time and love that there are so many different sized dots for decorations.  This was an awesome buy for anyone who has fun with nail art!</li>
    <li> Pretty easy to use with a steady hand, well made and easy to make beautiful designs with! I love it, I love giving my sisters and their friends manicures with these! Extremely affordable and fun to use!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these tools,so easy for her to make her designs, does the job, very happy with our choice!</li>
    <li> My daughter who is 11 loves doing her finger nails.  She wanted a way to add some designs to her nails, this product helped her to come up with a few designs such as lady bugs and hearts.</li>
    <li> this is just fabulous.. my daughter is using them all the time and her nails look so cute...worth the money</li>
    <li> Perfect. Anyone who wants to start doing nail art should invest in these dotting tools.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! Thank you</li>
    <li> I just rec&#x27;d  marblezing dotting pens in main. Product description is inaccurate ,they are all one color &amp; not multiple colors as advertised.</li>
    <li> Just the first time i used and one of them felt down from my hand and broke up! The plástic is no good</li>
    <li> My 13 year old loves decorating her nails with this set! Great quality and great price!  Will last a lifetime!</li>
    <li> I love my Dotting tools. They are easy to use, easy to clean, and come in many sizes. Whatever size dot you need, you can find it in this set. They can be used for things other than dots. I use them to make free hand hearts or if I have small area in a design that needs to be filled, I use one of these in a dabbing method. Very versatile and they will last you forever. They are made of metal (I think) so they won&#x27;t wear down or lose their shape of any of that nonsense.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY great! They came super fast, and work amazing on my nails. So excited to show the beautiful designs they make.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses these things a lot, she change her nail color every weekend so that she can put designs on her fingers</li>
    <li> I buy matching brushes so I thought I&#x27;d try these and they are fabulous</li>
    <li> Love these. I obviously use these for my nail art, and it&#x27;s great bc they were inexpensive unlike some other vendors and sites. you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought my dotting tools about a year ago. I specifically waited a year so that I could make sure they would last long enough. What&#x27;ll you know its been about a year and I still have every dotting tool working perfectly. Also the packaging was very safe I was highly appreciative of that because the plastic is fragile and so carful packaging is key. Wonderful product</li>
    <li> Variety of sizes, good price, works well.</li>
    <li> Takes 3 weeks to get them, but worth the wait for the price. The other reviews are correct, many of the tips are the same size, but they work well for dotting and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I do arts and crafts, this is what I plan on using them for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jean Loos</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected, and a great price too.</li>
    <li> As expected . Good quality</li>
    <li> Two of them broke while using them, and not even putting any pressure on them... but they served the purpose. Especially for the price that was paid for them.</li>
    <li> Great Item. Shipping was Great! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping, and sturdy product! Love mine!</li>
    <li> These are great for the price. I wish I had gotten all different colors and not just pink. But they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Gave it three stars cause 5 of the dotting tools are the same size. The description said there are ten different sizes. Oh well. It gets the job done. It came two weeks early but the shipping still takes forever since it is shipping from overseas. Overall it&#x27;s a good product, very stable.</li>
    <li> I really like what I can do on my nails! I get compliments all the time.  I&#x27;m so happy with it and I definitely like the price. They are easy to use, and you can get a good grip on them so you have a lot of control over making your designs. My sister doesn&#x27;t have the steadiest hands, but she is able to work with them and get nice designs on her nails. If you&#x27;re an amateur at nail design these will work well for you. This is so easy to use that I am able to change my designs on my nails more often! These are a lot of fun to use and really high quality craftsmanship.  Good variety of designs can be attained with this set as well.</li>
    <li> Good dotting tools, I love it.</li>
    <li> They arrived promptly, and I love them! Easy to use, and easy to clean! I was looking for a dotting set, and these have reached my expectations.</li>
    <li> 1) Super Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;2) Product is just like the picture&lt;br /&gt;3)I love my new nail dotting tools I use them all the time&lt;br /&gt;4) I 100% recommend this product :)&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OHQR1Q/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> Two of them broke shortly after I got them. The others are showing signs of cracking after very little use.</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are great. They&#x27;re very useful, well made, and super affordable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set includes five different dotting tools, each one double sided. Some of the middle sized dotting tips, as mentioned by other reviewers, are very similar and size and are a bit redundant. I wouldn&#x27;t say this is completely useless or a disappointment, though. It&#x27;s nice to have multiple tools if you&#x27;re working on a design that requires more than one polish color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these are very well made, considering the affordable price. I have not had any issues with them breaking or the tips coming loose. The metal tips are sealed directly into the plastic handles. They&#x27;re very durable, very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are also very easy to clean. I&#x27;ve used mine a lot since I&#x27;ve gotten them and they still look as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these if you&#x27;re passionate about nail art. It&#x27;s so much easier to dot with these than to try to make due with toothpicks or other substitutes. I&#x27;m glad I bought them!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re even looking at these, just buy them.  I had doubts about dotting tools, thinking I could use something, anything!, else, and I&#x27;m sure you can.  But your designs won&#x27;t look as nice and you won&#x27;t be as thrilled with how easy it can be.  The five sticks come with a single size on one end and multiple sizes of round dots on the other.  I&#x27;d say the smallest looks like the head of a needle (curved tip in my pack) and the largest is a dimple in a golf ball.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re well-made, they came quickly from their origin, and I love creating new looks using them.</li>
    <li> I just got these in the mail today after ordering them Saturday. Pretty quick delivery. Love these. They truly are 10 different sizes. I was worried after looking at other similar products for sale and seeing reviews stating that even though the picture showed 10 different sizes that there were doubles in the pack when they got their order. I HAD to test these out as soon as I got them and LOVED them. I&#x27;d been using my own home made dotter which was only 1 size and was just a flat head sewing pin stuck into a pencil eraser. These are MUCH easier to use. Anyone who does a lot of nail art and likes the dotted look on your nails should buy these tools.</li>
    <li> these are great for many designs love the quality and overall very easy to use, absolutely favorite utencil to have inmy nail art collefction</li>
    <li> they got here supper fast. way before the shipping date. well packaged and fast delivery. i was so excited to get them so i could do designs on my nails, i love these dotting tools, they are amazing and have a good affordable price.</li>
    <li> They look cheap. And on one end they&#x27;re all different sizes. And on the other end they&#x27;re all the same :/</li>
    <li> i took a chance on these hoping they wouldnt be cheaply made..and when i opened the package i was sooooo shocked at how thick and professional they looked!! for the price i was blown away at how great they worked and i believe they will last for a very long time!! i usually pay around 8 dollars for just one of these and to get a pack of them for a penny!! WOW!! i will reorder again and again! the shipping was also very quick and no problems at all!! thanks!!</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are good for decorating nails. I never personally used them. I suspect it takes some talent and expertise to make the decoration look good</li>
    <li> Awesome, I would recommend cleaning them after every use! don&#x27;t be lazy like me and let the polish dry on the pens because it is a pain to get off!</li>
    <li> The metal parts just started falling off, these are very cheap, would not buy again.</li>
    <li> The dotting pens are easy to use and have different sizes. Although on one end of the pen each size was the same, but it is  still a great purchase for something inexpensive.</li>
    <li> the girls spend hours doing their nails with these tools.  used these tools the entire summer when they were in their nail phase.  did some real cute designs with them too.</li>
    <li> very easy to use 10 different sizes you can choose from&lt;br /&gt;when you go to use them its not hard to hold</li>
    <li> Sure, I received five double tipped pens.  Five of the pens have the same size tips on one end, four have the same size on two ends.  What I got was only four different sizes. I use these for making dots and hearts on decorative painting and was expecting ten different size tips. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> i love the product and was also very cheap .Good for doing nail art and much more! i love it</li>
    <li> I ordered pink ones and when I got them they were all different colors.Which was okay but i was expecting pink. I was slightly dissapointed that they were not what I expected. The metal piece fell out of 1 also where the metal piece was at it was cracked so that explains why it fell out. So I will have to glue it back in. But I do like them, Not sure if I would fully recommend them.</li>
    <li> Takes a while to receive</li>
    <li> These pens are way too cool.  They are light weight and work great.  I am glad I purchased them.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been waiting for this item for a month now and still nothing. it says it should get here in 17 days is a lie.</li>
    <li> Bought a set for myself and a set for an 11 yr old in our family. She loved the set and was able to practice creating cool nail art.</li>
    <li> I really do like these.  Not only are they great for Manicures, they also work wonderfully for working with clay that I use to make beads with.  Double your pleasure.  :)</li>
    <li> These pens are just what I needed. They are perfect for nail art of any kind, perfect. Great product too.</li>
    <li> I can make different designs.  Love it</li>
    <li> I love it too much, it can help me make a beautiful painted fingernails, very convenient, but also make the pattern change a lot, very cute.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and have the right variety of sizes. Easy to clean. They even look good for display. Thank you</li>
    <li> So many different sizes! Perfect for all uses and marbelizing! Thanks!</li>
    <li> ITS THE BEST EVER ! ITS THE BEST GREAT ITS THE BEST! ITS THE BEST! ITS THE BEST! ITS THE BEST! ITS THE BEST!</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are awesome. Very cute and easy to use. I haven&#x27;t much skill but they look great and are way better than using the toothpicks I have been.</li>
    <li> I love these tools...the only thing is that they are all the same size. I gave some to my friends.</li>
    <li> I love the different colors and the different size tips for easy change of sizes. THey are a great buy!</li>
    <li> Them items come in a small plastic carrying case. None of the pens are made the same for every order. You can get anywhere from 5 different ends to 10. My pens have 8 different ends (a few of them have the same). I got these pens for only a few dollars so I can&#x27;t say that I expect them to last for a long time. For this price, you can&#x27;t beat what you&#x27;re getting. It works great for now. I&#x27;d easily recommend this product for anyone that enjoys nail art. This works for pretty much any nail polish/paint and are very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It was supposed to be an assortment of colors but all that came was pink color. It was a gift and I didn&#x27;t have time to get another one sent. Some were different sized tips. I told her maybe she could give the extras to her friends. :/</li>
    <li> Came in the mail sooner than I had expected, the quality was very nice, for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend!</li>
    <li> Set arrived as shown, on time.  I was skeptical because it said almost a month before I would receive it, but I got it right away.  Maybe within 5 business days and still working with them.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, pretty set of tools and was exactly what I was looking for.  It only took two weeks to get to me from Hong Kong.  I highly recommend them if you need help with nail dotting like I do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail diva on a budget, so these were a great step up from my home-made dotting tools. I thought the tips would be in 10 different sizes, but there&#x27;s actually only 5 different sizes; one side of each tool has a different size, then the opposite ends are all the same size, which is a size that&#x27;s already on the other end of one of the tools. Still totally worth it.</li>
    <li> first time I used one of the dotters, it broke. I don&#x27;t think the metal parts are supposed to come off. After a little krazy glue, they are just fine..</li>
    <li> Great kit for nail heads that love nail design! Perfect for someone like me who is starting out with dotting design! I enjoy it and the tools are cute!</li>
    <li> First of all, they came 9 days earlier than expected. That was a pleasant surprise :) I immediately tore my package open and saw exactly what I had imagined. They&#x27;re a little smaller than a pencil, but feels natural in my hand. The dots that were included were on the small side which is good for intricate dot patterns, but not if you&#x27;re looking for large polka dots or whatever. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product :)</li>
    <li> Please locate my order,can&#x27;t tract on it.Until now I don&#x27;t have it,please just wondering where&#x27;s my order.thanks hoping for your reply soon.</li>
    <li> Got these for very cheap and free shipping. They were exactly what I was looking for. I can&#x27;t wait to do new designs on my nails without using empty ballpoint pens or toothpicks!</li>
    <li> Took a little bit to arrive from China but it was just as described and couldn&#x27;t be priced any better!</li>
    <li> Shipping was right on time. I have been wanted one of these for so long to do nail art. Works just as I wanted it to. Love it!</li>
    <li> My wife at first had no idea what they were. Now that she has used them she likes them. Can&#x27;t complain for the price. Just a little long for shipping.</li>
    <li> Every nail art enthusiast needs a set of dotting tools.  These are great, especially as a starter set.  I have not had the issues like other reviews I&#x27;ve read with the priduct being cheaply made, mine have held up great.  Keep in mind that there are not 10 different sizes, there are 5 different sizes (one on each tool) and the other ends are all the same\</li>
    <li> i got 6 sizes, i had read reviews that other people were upset there were going to be more sizes but honestly i dont know why it matters. its easy to make bigger or smaller dots by just using less polish or lighter dots. good quality, easy to clean, easy to use.. a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> These are great. I just started doing my own nails to cut down on my beauty budget. These work pretty well. Just make sure when you&#x27;re using these for dotting during a design, that you cover the tips with a little extra paint, nail polish, or whatever you&#x27;re using. Really easy to clean and I love the fact that they are double sided.</li>
    <li> I love these. They work great and are very easy to maneuver, and they come in a nice little storage packet. When I received mine, they were not green, yellow, clear, blue, and pink, they were all pink. I don&#x27;t mind this though, I think they look really pretty, and I love how they work. They can also be used for nail art designs and lines and pictures as well as dots, so they are just all around great in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It works good enough were I could use it for my everyday life and works still  today and hasn&#x27;t given me any trouble.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my daughter.  They are a great price for the quality.  I received the purchase on time.</li>
    <li> Love this set! works great for making polka dots. I just struggle with my non dominant hand. Maybe practice on a piece of paper first.</li>
    <li> This came exactly as explained in the description. I love these and use them all the time.</li>
    <li> This set of dotting tools are super helpful to my manicures! I know that they have made an improvement to my nail art. The one con is that one side of all of them are the same size, but for the price you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, no other product can compare to it. I will continue to purchase this product as long as its available and refer this product to others. Just knowing this product was so useful I have been happy to purchase and know I have not wasted money. This product is not just long lasting but show great results that I have not seen in any other product that I have purchased. If your trying to find your solution to which product would be best. You can stop your searching this product will not only impress you, but have you with the best outcomes. You will not have to look any further nor will you be thinking about any other product like.</li>
    <li> These took a while to come in, but be patient, they are so inexpensive it is worth the wait! I use these for pairing glasses.</li>
    <li> Received these yesterday, 9 days before the earliest expected arrival date :D I tried these out last night and I really like them!! I like the different sizes of dotters and the range of sizes. I really like the design of the handle, it&#x27;s cute. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product at a great price!!</li>
    <li> The tips crackes off:( but other then that they work perfect!</li>
    <li> Soo much I can do with these tools. Im really pleased with the timing on when it showed up.&lt;br /&gt;Ready to make so many designs!</li>
    <li> fast shipping, and great price. at the store you will get one dotting tool for that price but here you get 5 that are double sided. really great product. would deffinately recommend.</li>
    <li> I have looked every where for dotting tools at the stores that are close by my house before I finaly just went to online searching. This product has gotten to me in a timely manner. It has helped me with my own nail art and at the fraction of the price any where else I have found. I love the swirl of color through the handle it is awesome thank you! Definatly will  be recommending to my friends and family!</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my 12 year old daughter and she uses them all the time. Great value. Good quality.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. Fast shipping, and when I got the product it was not damaged or broken in any way. The colors are different from in the picture though. I got purple, light blue, white, pink, and dark blue. But the tools work great for me, and they come in a nice variety of different sizes. I would recommend this to anyone who wanted to have some fun with their nails, whether they are a proffesional or an eight year old. Over all, this was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Best purchase on amazon. Came in two days and it was exactly as described. I use this every time I do my nails. Love it!</li>
    <li> I had been using hair pins for dots. Decided to give these a try. Love them!! Much easier to hold and the dots come out round and not drippy.</li>
    <li> When I received my tools in the mail. Two or three of the little end pieces had fallen out. It&#x27;s nothing a little super glue it hot glue can&#x27;t fix though. I did notice that some of the dots seem to be the same size, but for the price I paid (1.95 w/s&amp;h) that&#x27;s no big deal. As far as the outcome of the dots. They look really nice. I&#x27;m no artist, so coming from me...that&#x27;s GREAT! And clean up was a breeze too. I just used a little acetone and hand rag and the polish came of very easy. If you&#x27;re looking for something like a salon would use, keep scrolling. Otherwise, this is a great set!</li>
    <li> Have not tried them yet. I am sure they will work for art design well. They are just what I expected by the pictures on amazon.</li>
    <li> The dots on one side of the pens seem to be the same to the naked eye but once you put nail polish on it and make a dot on your nail it is evident all dots are a different size. I absolutely love these. Took like 2 weeks to ship.</li>
    <li> I love this dotting tools.. They were in a really good price.. And they came earlier than i expected.. Best of all they are brand new, not broken,.. All perfect..  ;-)</li>
    <li> I love this tool! I use it to make flowers on my big toenail, and use it to make flowers on my nails, Depending on what size flower you want you can use the different dotters they have! They are cheap, didnt take but 2 weeks to get here, and well worth the wait! I owed a pair before this but misplaced them so glad I found these again though!</li>
    <li> I love them! They are adorable, they arrived much quicker than I expected so that was a pleasant surprise, affordable and work wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;My nails are always adorable now, I love what these tools are capable of.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend, my friends want them as well!&lt;br /&gt;So perfect. Thank You.</li>
    <li> I was using toothpicks and smashing the ends of them and it just didn&#x27;t work until I discovered these dotting tools in m any different sizes.  They are great for making dots on fingernails..A very great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time with help from youtube tutorials I can decorate my nails like a pro.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Very useful for my job manicure,do many drawings!</li>
    <li> They do what they&#x27;e supposed to do and they&#x27;re pretty.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves these, uses them daily with all her nail gems.  Great stocking filler for Christmas.  Highly recommend.  Order now because coming from China.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. I like having them. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I got these just as the picture shows with the same colors and same size tips.  In the picture the orange is turned around because all the balls are the same size on one end and vary at the other giving you six total sizes.  They came in a small plastic pouch and seem sturdy enough, though I haven&#x27;t had them for long.  Basically, for anyone who isn&#x27;t doing very detailed and very specific nail art who need more than six size dots on a nail, these are perfect.</li>
    <li> Loved them!!! Arrived before actual date set!!!</li>
    <li> great for nail art design as well as a good tool for sculpey clay when you are looking to do very detailed work</li>
    <li> I used these for less than an hour and one of the tools broke in half, I went to wipe off the polish and it snapped off.  I barely put any pressure on it.</li>
    <li> I just got mines in the mail and i love it. Makes it so much easier than using a toothpick or other things.</li>
    <li> These are great for nail art and for the price you get all the different sizes so you get to design so great nail art.</li>
    <li> This came on time but wasn&#x27;t in tip top condition, I suggest you find a different seller so that you don&#x27;t have to receive a broken item. I fixed my item easily with a hot glue gun but it was disappointing to have received a broken product.</li>
    <li> One of the pens broke off after using it a few times but it is still pretty good I just crazy glued it back together.&lt;br /&gt;Now all I need to do is learn how to use it.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are wonderful. They work perfectly and do the job. They are really cute too! I love them!</li>
    <li> These are awesome, made well, styled cute.... easy to grip. love the different size ball tips. thank you for prompt service!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for my granddaughter who is completely involved with nail art.  She tells me that the set is &amp;#34;awesome.&amp;#34;  She LOVES it.</li>
    <li> i love the different sizes plus it is double sided! Also easy to clean i would recommend!And for the price...PERFECT!</li>
    <li> these are really nice I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they&#x27;re the same quality that they use at the nail salon and I love how they look</li>
    <li> This product came in early and was great from the start and I love it! So glad that I got it!</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time. It was very affordable and better quality then other products I have bought.</li>
    <li> Got It 5/21/13....Fast Shipping...Wasnt Expecting To Get It This Soon Since It Said It Would Get Here In Like A Month....I Love The Colors...I Cant Wait To Use It...</li>
    <li> i like it. nice stuff but only has 6 points not 10. one side of each &amp;#34;pen&amp;#34; has the same size</li>
    <li> This set of dotting tools is exactly what I wanted and what I expected. They are great tools and very affordable. The only negative is that the shipping takes several weeks. The price and effectiveness of the item outweighs that inconvenience. I would buy this again, or recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> These are as the should be. I love them. Mine are pink. My niece loves polka dots.</li>
    <li> I use them all the time; I love that they are all different sizes. It makes it very helpful when I need it.</li>
    <li> For Nail lovers, this is a great tool, perfect product. Dots of different sizes, they are excellent. As described above, are inexpensive products. Great!</li>
    <li> i am still learning to use these. but they come in a huge assortment of sizes on each end. there super cute and easy to use for polka dots. still learning other things but its fun to try!!</li>
    <li> I am finally able to design my girls nails like they do at the salon.  It makes great dots and I am learning how to do other designs as well.</li>
    <li> I got this way before it said it would come I can do designs on my nails a lot easier now I definately recommend buying this</li>
    <li> It came in great form. The came a week earlier that supposed and they work really good, i recommend getting them</li>
    <li> we do nail art all the time , they are perfect.,you can do so many different  drawings with them,love them</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with how fast they got this item to me! I wasn&#x27;t supposed to get it for another week and a half! I would defiantly recommend this item to anybody!</li>
    <li> Coming from someone who always used toothpicks as &amp;#34;dotting tools&amp;#34; this was a godsend. The set of 5 cost me less than two dollars and was so worth it. I love having the different sizes to make different dots. Lastly, they just look good too.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time helps out with my designs that I do at home.  Using them is simple and can turn a boring manicure into something exciting! A simple dip in the polish with these things can you many compliments on your manicure.  I love these things!! All the tips are different sizes so you can create lots of different designs.</li>
    <li> I love it the colors are beautiful and mesmerizing I love it so much and it came a week before it its due date</li>
    <li> They arrived on time, and they are nice colors! On the contrary, I don&#x27;t happen to think there are special, expensive, high quality dotting tools that will do anything special besides.... Well... Make dots! They are durable and come in a good variety of sizes to fit any design I choose to paint. However you must clean them if you want the sizes to stay the same throughout their use. Just wipe them off with polish remover and they are as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they do the job well and for a cutting edge price for a nail fanatic like me</li>
    <li> I honestly could not wait to receive this in the mail. I would check everyday for them. Once I got them it was time to use them. Use them all the time to make dots, leopard print, flowers and other good nail art.</li>
    <li> My daughter (17yo) loves doing her nails, and she&#x27;s been looking for tools like these to help the polish go on the way she wants. She&#x27;s very excited about these tools. She has only used them once, and they were great. If needed, we&#x27;ll update later (as in, if there&#x27;s a problem after repeated use). For now, we&#x27;re QUITE pleased - such a great value!</li>
    <li> i use these about everyday so easy to use and gives plain manicured nails a salon effect!!!! love the diferent size dots you can create.</li>
    <li> Nice for dotting flowers onto the nail or painting decals with them. I also use them to place little pieces of glitter on my wet nails!!!</li>
    <li> *Shipping took around 2 weeks for me to receive that&#x27;s cool with me though because it was FREE SHIPPING :D&lt;br /&gt;*Condition they were perfectly in shape nothing got broken on its way here.&lt;br /&gt;*Product over all, I love. It was very affordable compared to other beauty supply stores and does the job! Yes some of the tips are repeated but I actually like that because I can do multiple colored dots at once.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this for a beginner (like myself).&lt;br /&gt;♥</li>
    <li> This product is fun to use and is cheap :) I would recommend this product to a friend :) what are ya waiting for ??? Buy now :)</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this as a backup two my original.  My daughter constantly uses my nail care tools, and forgets to put them back.  I ordered this set for her.  When I received them I decided to keep them for myself.  They where better quality, and prettier than the old set.  The price and shipping was the best part.  Cheaper price than my old set and I received everything by mail within a few days.</li>
    <li> I purchased for myself thought how hard could this be.  Once I practiced a few times its easy.  I have gotten comments on my dotted toes.... Like it and it would make a fun gift for someone who has everything.</li>
    <li> Okay so I got this product 2 days ago and I looooove it! The only thing I wish they would have told me was that alll of the toting tools have the same size dot on one side!!! So it&#x27;s like you  are only getting three actual dotting tools instead of 5!!!! Just something to consider..... I o love the quality of this product though!</li>
    <li> the ends are the same on all the tools, i was under the impression that they were eight different sizes</li>
    <li> These are awesome&lt;br /&gt;I love using them and they&#x27;re easy to use&lt;br /&gt;They are very inexpensive which is great and a nail guru&#x27;s best friend if you are not good at making dots or any kind of circle lol.</li>
    <li> This is very very nice. I satisfied and I can use now for decorating my nails. Thank u very very much. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Picked the pink color and got rainbow instead. Otherwise good quality. Shipped fast. Just annoying I paid extra for pink and didn&#x27;t get it</li>
    <li> I like these dotters but I was disappointed that only 3 were different not all 5. And they were all different colors but that isn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
    <li> I use these for everything. Polymer clay, nails, even paiting. They&#x27;re cute and light, easy to store away. Will be buying from yoou again</li>
    <li> Get these before they run out. I know you can make one at home but these are so cute to look at and they do a great job.</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools, I&#x27;ve learned to do my own designs.  I save myself some trips to the nail spa.</li>
    <li> Yes I have no experience decorating nails, so take my review for what it&#x27;s worth. Just could not &amp;#34;draw&amp;#34; with these.</li>
    <li> Good conditions, it has all the perfect sizes that I wanted, even though it took a while to receive them I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with them</li>
    <li> Love love love I seriously couldn&#x27;t say anything else I mean there dotting tools but to tally worth it love them</li>
    <li> These came in within a week, and were perfect for painting on polymer clay and details. :) Very happy that there were 2 sides to all five dotting tools a total of ten sizes to use!!!</li>
    <li> Some of the tools are the same size. Can&#x27;t complain. Overall, it&#x27;s okay if you just want a simple design on your nails.</li>
    <li> It came in great condition . When I used it on my nails the design that I wanted came out and it really works.</li>
    <li> It took it a while to get to me but came just as described. I would buy again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I bought these dotting tools for my daughter to do her nail art with.  I quality of these dotting tools were great.  The price - great.  She has gotten good use out of these tools.</li>
    <li> Wow! I was soooo surprised when I opened this package!  I cannot explain how nice and versitile these are. They first are just so cool to look at. Then the dotting tools have all different sizes and they are double sided.  I really felt happy,  and still do, about these dotting tools. They&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> They are beautifully crafted and also so easy to dot , used and amazed of how great they are and easy to keep clean</li>
    <li> the order was fine. the product was fine. came earlier than expected. each pen is a different size and color.</li>
    <li> I just recieved mine in the mail I was excited to open but when I did I only saw 5 different sizes. I am quite dissapointed but I guess cheap price means cheap products? Other that that it came in great conditions I would suggest to begginers and not proffesionals.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for. Love how it gives you many different options on the size. Nice very pleased.</li>
    <li> These are okay to use alone as you do your own nails but I think a helper could really do some very artistic work on your nails using these.</li>
    <li> One of the tips is not secure in the barrel. Shipped lousy. No protection for the item. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for this.</li>
    <li> This tool is awesome! the price is wonderful as well. I like this tool because it can used to make designs and because they are durable, i am sure this tool will last a while</li>
    <li> i paid less than $2.  variety of sizes is something to think about, if you&#x27;re wanting 10 to choose from...</li>
    <li> It is so great. I it helps me to create so many designs on my nails and I bought for a chap price. Thanks</li>
    <li> These are great and such a good value.  The pens have multiple sized ends so you can get pretty creative... or if you&#x27;re like me and not that creative, it&#x27;s super easy to make cute polka-dots.  I already bought more for a friend!</li>
    <li> Love it ..good price and arrived early than expected ,good quality my 5 year daughter wants some designs righ away ..</li>
    <li> The set is not only good for making dots, but connecting the dots, making flowers, lines, etc.  good for detail work too. You can use anything to make dots you have a home, but for the small price, you don&#x27;t have to find a pencil with an eraser, or use a pen, etc.  which after a while they fall apart.  these are sturdy, pretty and easy to find if they fall to the bottom of your nail works.  Good tools.... - good results.</li>
    <li> gave my sister for her birthday and she loved it so much she uses these all the time and she knows a few things about fun creative nail art products due to her having to learn it all in cosmetology she love this item and would recommend to alot of people</li>
    <li> These are great tools for more than just nail art.  They are helpful in many other craft areas and to top it off, they are really cute!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I saw that that this product was only 99 cents AND was shipping from China with no shipping fee. However, it&#x27;s the real deal. These dotting tools work really well, are easy to clean, and are quite sturdy (by now I&#x27;ve dropped then often enough to know!) . I definitely recommend them to nail art enthusiasts.</li>
    <li> They are so freaking cheep, you can&#x27;t really complain at all. They work perfectly fine. I&#x27;ve loved using them and really recommend them to anyone that likes to do nail art.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for when you want little, simple drawings on your nails and they were so cheap but good quality!</li>
    <li> some of the tips were broke on mine</li>
    <li> Was curious about these, but once I received them and began using them, I realized why people use them. Makes painting nails easy and fun.</li>
    <li> Item arrived within 4 days of placing my order. Exactly as it is in the pic. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> great! fast shipping had a very good deal...</li>
    <li> Some of the tools broke within a month. An okay product</li>
    <li> love it, great gift item</li>
    <li> I was so excited to order these, I&#x27;m big on nail designs and wanted to be able to make intricate ones. The first time I used it, however, the metal piece actually fell out of the handle and I had to glue it back in. It still works and does the jobs right, but I&#x27;d rather not have to put something back together before I can use it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and I had no problems with the shipping process.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re so great and easy to use! I love the dotting tools and the cute design is awesome. I use them all the time</li>
    <li> Use these all the time for specific dots and doodling in art work.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and well constructed.  Many uses.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are the same dotting tools I saw at Sally&#x27;s. I got them for a lot less on here and they arrived in good time! You get 10 different sizes and they are a very good quality material.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Product as described. Thank you :)</li>
    <li> These are made well. They are so pretty and they work so well to add special details to your nails. If needed I would re buy for sure. Worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I love baking and needed small tools to depress fondant &amp; icing. These worked perfectly and were so inexpensive. However, they are well made. I have used them dozens of times and have washed them just as much. Great!</li>
    <li> If you love to do your nails or anyone elsess and always do dots or anything then these are the product for you. I just started doing my own nails since I have stopped biting them and these come in handy so much for when I wanna do dot designs</li>
    <li> The dotting tools where just as pictured, they seem very sturdy and will probably last a lifetime shipping was faster then quoted, I have used them and they seem great. Would purchase again if I ever needed too but I have a feeling I will have these forever.</li>
    <li> I bought these not only for the amazing price,but because they would actually come in handy.When i make a design on my nails.For am not too good at using a bobby pin when designing.So this helps a lot for me.Although i thought they would be bigger, but their not it&#x27;s  actually small,but descent size.</li>
    <li> Awesome for nail art. Love that there are a lot of different sized metal tips to create different designs and shapes.</li>
    <li> I like the dotting pen set to do my nails. There are different sizes, though some of the sizes seem to be the same. Either way, I like that these dotting pens give me different size options (still) of the dots on my nails.</li>
    <li> It work perfectly it got here on time and it was easy to use but u do have to clean it after every use or it won&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I totally love these dotting tools but it took a while to get here so i was like WAITING day and night for them to come!</li>
    <li> These are beautiful. Easy to find in my basket of nail supplies. They have a wide variety of dot sizes. I bought nail tape too. Those combinations make great nails.</li>
    <li> A birthday gift for my girlz and they sure loved them , thanks again cheap price and they will enjoy them</li>
    <li> These are spherical rather than being flat on top. They don&#x27;t actually put a dot on your nails the size of the ball, they just put a tiny speck of polish from the top of the ball. You can sand down the top, and they&#x27;re certainly cheap, but they&#x27;re poorly made.</li>
    <li> Thes are very colorful and really fun. It did not take long to get the nail design pins in. You should get them.</li>
    <li> chose 5 stars because these dotting tools are pretty sweet. when I find more time to decorate i&#x27;ll do more! definitely worth price.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my daughter nails and it great!! I had another one it collects too much lint. I will tell other customer to buy it first to see if they like it.</li>
    <li> It came just as I thought it would, in a white bag with all 5. I have made many nail designs and it is really helpful(:</li>
    <li> they are pretty cool, they are double sided which is sooo cool, they make doing your nails a little easier than using toothpicks, worth it if you love nail art</li>
    <li> I use this on my nail clients.&lt;br /&gt;These tools, made dotting, nails ,designs, complete with ease, and comfort&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, recommend anyone to purchase</li>
    <li> I got all my items before the time frame given.  I have seen the items in stores or salons for up to three times the amount.  Use them frequently and am finding new non traditional ways to use them also. Great items great price.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, doesn&#x27;t work all that well but I can manage. The tips seem to smudge a lot more than anticipated.</li>
    <li> I like the variety of sizes that came with this set. They are absolutely beautiful to look at. They come in a nice clear little bag that helps to keep them all together. The shipping was super fast, and the quality of these dotting tools are superior.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a great set for an amazing price. It&#x27;s perfect for the nail &amp;#34;art&amp;#34; I want to create. The shipping was quick and I was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using the Dotting Pens. My daughter and I had a &amp;#34;mani/ pedi&amp;#34; day for back to school looks and were able to try many different nail art. We enjoyed ourselves and it was simple. Many other sellers sell this same product for a much higher price so I smiled and clicked &amp;#34;checkout&amp;#34; when I saw the chance. The only thing about the products is that it took so long to get to us that I&#x27;d forgotten that I purchased it until it was delivered at my door. But it could have different had I rushed ordered. All in all it came right on time. Keep up the great work sellers. I will be purchasing quite a few more for my other nieces, who enjoyed using the pens also.</li>
    <li> they work well but they arent that special, I could get the same results with a pen! but i would recommend them if you are into nail art</li>
    <li> They arrived way before they were scheduled too! I tried them right away and loved them. I love the different sizes and all the designs i can make with them :)</li>
    <li> I will never be able to stop saying enough amazing things about these dotting pens.  I bought the set for next to nothing &amp; split them with a girlfriend of mine when they arrived (I got 3 pends, she got 2.  Hey, I paid!)  We&#x27;re pulling off nail art we never though was possible.  Last month I met up with another friend as she was leaving her nail salon &amp; her nail lady asked where I got my nails done.  Best.  Feeling. Ever. :)</li>
    <li> It was a great tool I love and I will end up using it like every single time I do my nails or someone else&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I like them a lot. They are the right size for nails.  Good and sturdy construction. I ordered these for my daughter for her birthday. I did not realize that, they were coming from China.  So delivery time was almost a month.  All in all, I am happy.</li>
    <li> It was ok but I would never recommended this to others unless it better and something new comes to replace the look and make it work a whole lot easier to work with.</li>
    <li> The sizes vary from small to extra large, making them perfect for any art design that you have in mind. I use them to do simple designs such as french tips or just anything that comes to mind. I would definitely suggest this to any nail art lover!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love using these tools.  It makes it so much easier to add designs to my nails.  They are very stylish and very easy to use.  I would use this seller again, very prompt in receiving order and a great buy.</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal!! I was looking at this product here in the states and found it was a much better deal online. They are worth the wait!!</li>
    <li> very good..they make wonderful dots and very sturdy..well worth the price and wait..love all the different size they  come in</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift to a friend that like nail art. She liked it. I also bought one for myself and use it as a clay tool</li>
    <li> love these tools! comes in a total of 6 different sizes which is more than enough to create many different designs</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with them. Maybe long shipping wait but it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> really nice and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My wife bought these and is disappointed in them. They don&#x27;t really do that great of a job.</li>
    <li> These tools are amazing! It took a while for them to ship to me but they were definitely worth the wait! I would recommend this! The design is very cool and they are the perfect size for my hands.</li>
    <li> These are so fun and make manicures easy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy. They did come like pictured. They are different sizes. There&#x27;s a few that seem the same size but I still have a variety.</li>
    <li> Tips fall off really easily</li>
    <li> Love them just wish they where numbered</li>
    <li> These let you make more detailed designs!</li>
    <li> Works great. Over time the tip came out of the handle but it is easy to glue it back in.</li>
    <li> This item was everything I wanted it to be. When I had read other customer reviews some people said that they only came with one size but mine came with 6 different kinds!! This item was VERY reasonably priced and a great buy! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> These would be good but they don&#x27;t fit into the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love these! They also work great for painting and using with polymer clay!</li>
    <li> These are really neat, attractive design and easy to use. I am a novice and think are perfect for beginners.</li>
    <li> They took a while to come in the mail (2 weeks) but the nail dotters are great! You only get 6 sizes instead of the promised 10 though , however , I had already known that prior to purchasing the nail dotters. I think that the price was also very cheap! I definitely recommend these nail dotters. I love them!</li>
    <li> love love love these tools&lt;br /&gt;It workds great and I would recommend if you love doing your nails like i do</li>
    <li> Works great. Nice solid construction. Cheap price. what&#x27;s not to love? I will even be using these in my regular art paintings :-)</li>
    <li> This is just what I expected and it came within the expected time! Keep in mind it ships from Hong Kong so it take a really long time to get here. It&#x27;s so cheap! Keep in mind that there are actually only six sized, not ten like they say.</li>
    <li> I just got this product on Saturday, and I really like the designs and how the detailers themselves are working out. Haven&#x27;t gotten to really do anything amazing with them yet, but as soon as I do, I know I&#x27;ll love these!</li>
    <li> The dotting tools were very cheap but you get what you paid for. There were some repeated sizes but they work just fine. I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This is perfect. On nail art videos you always see that you can use other things like bobby pins or tooth picks; I&#x27;ve tried them all, the result doesn&#x27;t compare to what the actual dotting tools create. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say that they aren&#x27;t 10 actual different sized dotting tools, that&#x27;s so that you can use different tools rather than have to use the two ends in the same manicure. It&#x27;s easier and much better to have these. I&#x27;ve used them in multiple nail art designs and they are perfect. I also like how they&#x27;re the same ones that many of the nail art tutorials on YouTube use, so it&#x27;s easier to pick out which size/color tool to use. I&#x27;ve had them for a while and they haven&#x27;t broken or anything. The pouch they arrive in is great for storage and keeping them together. It&#x27;s a perfect product quite honestly.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re pretty and they work great. There are a lot of different sized dots you can make with them. Cheers!</li>
    <li> great product but the large dots and the medium dots turn out to be the EXACT same size other than that i would have given it 5 stars</li>
    <li> It did take a while to get here but when i got them they worked perfectly c: i recommend this to anyone who likes doing their nails c:</li>
    <li> They are perfect and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I&#x27;ve been using&lt;br /&gt;Them since I recived them and they are supubre. I bought an extra one&lt;br /&gt;To give away as well because I liked the way they worked and I&#x27;m sure they&lt;br /&gt;Will too.  The delivery was even faster than what I expected. So I give it a&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up and if I even need to buy more I will buy from them. :))</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. It came quicker than things shiped in this country. They work really well and are cute easy to use. Even my daughter of 8 had no issues using these.  You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Really cool! Too bad i dont know what it is for. But love the colors! Looks really elegant. Cool for people that know how to use it.</li>
    <li> These work very well to do any size dots or designs. I would definitely recommend them! &amp;#60;3 I love them!</li>
    <li> smaller then expected but ok i guess.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE GREAT. THEY WORK OKAY BUT I DON&#x27;T CARE THEY WERE LIKE A DOLLAR</li>
    <li> great for nail art!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
    <li> These are sturdy pens that I can use for my Zentangle art. Excellent seller &amp; prompt shipment. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone else got but I received 5 different sized pens. thanks! can&#x27;t wait to start usimg them!</li>
    <li> Not used yet, but looks cute</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say that I didn&#x27;t like it just that I never got the ithen :/</li>
    <li> Can not rate because I did not receive this item as of yet ordered on 30 December 2013 so who knows if it comes it ever comes in the mail then I would be able to do a rating</li>
    <li> One of the dotters broke when I went to use it for the first time...I glued it back in place and I am probably gonna have to do it with the rest of them shortly.</li>
    <li> i love it and the exact item ive asked for but the only thing im kinda disappointed at is that its kinda small but it can work perfectly tho.</li>
    <li> It claimed to be originally $14 at first and I bought it for basically $2 which makes this a steal. But it may be worth that much considering it came directly from China. I&#x27;m thinking the cost of shipping cost more than the value of the actual product. The product works well for what it is intended to do. Some of the sizes look very similar from each other. They are sturdy and seem well made.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t appreciate this product, but I don&#x27;t see what the hype is about. After using it once, I think you can probably achieve the same results with a toothpick or a cotton swab stick with the cotton removed.</li>
    <li> These are great! Actually better than I thought they were going to be.I am  Very happy with them. Thank You</li>
    <li> Not pleased due that it didn&#x27;t do what was expected of this product.</li>
    <li> These were just what I was looking for at a great price.  The ends are all different sizes and they&#x27;ve proven to be just what I needed.</li>
    <li> could not ask for a more better set of pens for art design. They work wonders.A real good investment. I would suggest anyone to buy these.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I would definitely recommend. :)</li>
    <li> They are good if you know how to use them but they were a great deal for the price. Great</li>
    <li> I thought for the little price they would be crappy nail art pens, but they are wonderful! Easy to hold, come in diff sizes and color! I would definitely recommend them to a friend :)</li>
    <li> Soo cheap. Really good quality. Not much to say other than buy them they are worth it</li>
    <li> Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these tools compared to the price.  I definitely recommend these.  Great product for sure.</li>
    <li> Work better than my expensive ones from Sally. They work well and are super cute. I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> There is lots of variety in the size. The service was excellent and the product is too. I&#x27;m hally with my purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sophisticated enough to tell the difference between the sizes of a couple of them, but for the price I&#x27;m EXTREMELY happy and got to share with my friend :) Win-win!</li>
    <li> I dnt see how these can be used for polka dots. I&#x27;ve tried many times  to do so. When someone is successful please let me know</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are so easy and great to use. The only thing I have to complaint about is that they broke easily, in my first usage of them, the blue one dotting just fell apart :(</li>
    <li> Beautiful tools for a great price.  They do a nice job of adding designs to your nails.  Worth a try.</li>
    <li> Different sizes allows for many size dots.  Easy to hold and use.  Steel balls make for easy clean up.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Worth the couple of bucks I paid.  I have used it and one of the tips fell off, but considering what I paid, it didn&#x27;t both me.  There were 5 of the same size, so they are disposable if need be.  Shipping took a while, but that didn&#x27;t bother me either since I was notified up front when purchasing.</li>
    <li> Its what my daughter really wanted and loves using them everyday and changing the design on her nails to match her cloths</li>
    <li> Teenage granddaughter thought these were pens at first glance. When she looked at the book I bought to go with these she&lt;br /&gt;squealed with delight. She then proceeded to &#x27;do&#x27; everyone&#x27;s nail, even her dads! AND they do look professional!</li>
    <li> I love this so much. it makes it so much easier to do dots. this product is very cute and very simple to use</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them.. They work great &amp; I love how it has all the different sizes.. Anything is better then a bobby pin I guess</li>
    <li> Pretty and functional.  Makes perfect dots.  Can also use for my regular art projects, painting and making indentations in my clay pieces.  So many sizes of dots to choose from.  Good Value.  Good Price.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The product was as expected and shipped quickly. We have used these tools and they work very well. I look forward to placing an order in the near future.</li>
    <li> This is really fun.  I have to practice more, to get something beautiful going.&lt;br /&gt;This makes doing your nails at home really fun and practical.</li>
    <li> These are cute and colorful, come in a plastic bag for storage. Bought as a gift and did not come for forever.... She will be happy  to use these for her nail art though.</li>
    <li> Really great product.  Very satisfied.  Have a great time experimenting.  Just wish it had come with some type of instructions showing different types Of designs that can be done with the tools</li>
    <li> The product itself is a bit cheaply made, but it serves its purpose. One of the tips broke off the 2nd time my daughter used it,</li>
    <li> I like doing my own nails at home and this is a great product to use! The price was great as well!</li>
    <li> Wonderful price, wonderful product. Easy to use and sturdy. I use these all the time now.  Great buy and quality.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> I started seeing cracks at the base of the dotters and after a few uses a few fell out. Not to happy I have to buy glue to fix it</li>
    <li> The dotting metal parts are not glued to the plastic handles, they come out when I&#x27;m dotting and mess up my work.</li>
    <li> I got this set to replace the 1 double-ended dotting tool I had bought for much, much more at Sephora ($7! now it seems almost like highway robbery to pay that much for just 1!).  Great thing is that my set had different sized wands &amp; no repeats.  The item seems to be just as sturdy as my Sephora one, and cleans up just as well (I just dip the tip in a little bit of nail polish remover &amp; then wipe on a cotton ball).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I can think of for this is that since I didn&#x27;t get any repeats in the set, and since I didn&#x27;t buy a 2nd set, I&#x27;ll have to order another one for my sister-in-law who is a nail tech &amp; wait for that one to arrive. :-) Not bad if that&#x27;s the only complaint, right ladies &amp; gents?</li>
    <li> They so helpful with the decoration of your nails make it easy for you to create flowers and much more . They are different size with it will help more</li>
    <li> these, I really enjoy doing new things to my nails and this made designing them much easier. would recommed  these to others.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described! Quality is superb! Easy to clean! Easy storage! I love using these to create different designs. The possibilities ae endless!</li>
    <li> They work amazingly!!! The design and the product overall was fantastic!!! I really enjoy this product!!! I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> These are really nice, but they took several weeks to ship. The inexpensive price makes it worth it. I saw some like them for way more money.</li>
    <li> I wanted some dotting tools for my nail art. These were a good price and seemed useful in the photo. Took less than a month to get to my home, but the dots are much smaller than in the photo. They are mostly the same size, there&#x27;s truly only 2 sizes. But it was inexpensive and does the job OK.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to use because it comes in different styles and shape of the ball. I like the multi color so I know that the product is mine from everyone else&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are so cool! I was tired of using toothpicks and bobby pins for dotting tools and for the price of tese dotting tools, they are WELL WORTH THE PRICE! I love them.</li>
    <li> I originally  bought it for my co worker I use them more she does haha gonna have to reorder a set for myself.</li>
    <li> Some people have complained that the double ends aren&#x27;t different sizes, but they actually are. I bought these since I just use them at home about once a week for myself.&lt;br /&gt;The balls at the ends are already small so the differences between one size to the next is very slight.&lt;br /&gt;If you put them next to each other and have a good eye for sizing things, you can tell that each one is slightly bigger than the next.</li>
    <li> Love dotting tools second package I bought but this one was for my mom. One thing I did not like is that some come out of the hard plastic holder stick thing so then u have to glue it no biggy but its annoying.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. And its a great deal for its price! It is definitely a must buy for people who love to do their nails.</li>
    <li> These are the best dotting tools. They are easy to use. And when I couldn&#x27;t find any locally  I bought these They get here pretty quick.</li>
    <li> I bought these on a whim, have never used dotting/marbling tools before. They worked really well! I was shocked at how perfect the dots really do turn out. Works best with quality nail polish, but that&#x27;s to be expected. They&#x27;re all the same size on one end, but honestly, I can&#x27;t imagine needing a wider variety of sizes than what they supply.</li>
    <li> Love this product so easy to use great for doing detailed work on nails even on the little ones nails would recommend to any one Happy Nanny</li>
    <li> Exactly what expected. They are wonderful quality. I was very happy overall. I would suggest these to anyone who loves nail art.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this tools! We actually purchased some for my niece as well...they are both enjoying the ease with which they can make cool designs on their nails</li>
    <li> I love the fact that they&#x27;re different sizes, the only complain that I have is that one of them arrived broken.</li>
    <li> What you see isnt what you get. Mines didnt come in all pink it came in all different colors. It works as its supposed to. It did come early though.</li>
    <li> Very neat  nice grip good design would buy this a long time would recommend to anyone that look for a nail artist.</li>
    <li> I order a replacement since I couldn&#x27;t find my own set and picked out a pink set but turns out they are just like my old ones... Orange, blue, yellow, and green not pink at all...</li>
    <li> One of the sides of one came in broken... BUT!! If you still want it, was was able to fix it with super glue, and it still works like new. So if it fixable :)</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works well for dotting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Half of the tools broke or the metal detached from the plastic shortly after receiving my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there are 10 options for dotting, there are only 3-4 actual size differences.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this kit, ladies, if you&#x27;re looking to design your fingernail or any other object, which is what you need!</li>
    <li> I loved that I received this item before the time frame and it came well packaged. I have been wanting this kind of tools to help me in my pursue of my nail art hobby and it is just perfect because it has different sizes and they work as I imagined.</li>
    <li> Cmon guys...no instruction booklet? A few starter tips to lovely nails? These have proven worthless to me. I am disappointed!</li>
    <li> I ordered a few packages and every one had several broken pieces in it.  The metal separated from the plastic :( other than that,  they work nicely.</li>
    <li> VERY surprized on this product. Thought it would be very cheap and terrible. But its a great product. Happy Customer!</li>
    <li> Love! so cute and different sizes for different designs. Cant wait to do my nails! takes a while to come in though!</li>
    <li> Perfect, cheap and just what I needed for nail designs.  Great little products and cute pink ribbon design.  Love it</li>
    <li> I am enjoying creating designs with my new set of dotting tools, its easy and fun! The different sizes are perfect.</li>
    <li> I like this set a lot it is easy to use n it is very pretty and you can&#x27;t best the price</li>
    <li> Awesome set ,arrived early. Nicely made</li>
    <li> I love these tools! I like how there are different sizes on each end, it&#x27;s a great price, and just what I wanted for my nail art.</li>
    <li> I am happy to have purchased this. I love the colors and they are very useful when doing my nails. They are even great for other projects.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and they do the job. Nothing more to ask for in this product that I can see.</li>
    <li> These were cute but the one with the biggest ball was broken on the tip. Any who my 6 year old loves them she likes to use them on her crafts and the clean up is super fast</li>
    <li> Works great for what I needed</li>
    <li> I ordered these about 5 months ago for a Christmas present and they still have not come. Waste of money. DON&#x27;T GET.</li>
    <li> the item actually came sooner then I expected and works just as it should ive used it a few times now to make cool nail designs</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these! The different size of dotting. I just starting doing my own nails and now iam addicted! Lol</li>
    <li> Idk why it is in my reviews if I did not purchase this product that is so weird but ok</li>
    <li> i was excited to get these but when i opened them up they were broken. one tip was broken off, another was cracked across the middle and is about to break anytime now and the 3rd one has a big chip in it. yeah they were cheaply priced but they should of been in better condition. i was very disappointed in the quality of these :(</li>
    <li> So cute and works great! I loved the sizes and it came in perfect condition. I recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> Low quality - the metal points on most of the pens come out out the plastic body and had to be glued back in.</li>
    <li> Took a while to receive, but it shipped from far. This is my second set I order and its just what you expect. If you&#x27;re looking for good dotting tools without having to pay the expensive tag, and don&#x27;t mind waiting a while, definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> i had to go on my account to remember what i ordered, It has no instructions, well no title at that.I didn&#x27;t recognize what it was.</li>
    <li> I loved these! Sure some of them were repeats of sizes but for a penny?! A PENNY?! Who cares?! Not me!! I was so happy with these and none of mine are falling a part like others mentioned. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have 3 girls that love to have their nails painted and &amp;#34;polka-dotted&amp;#34;.  These are great.  I was just using a bobby pin that I pried open and it works about the same.  We like these because they look more &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;.  These were just a fun purchase... so, when the tip fell out of one I wasn&#x27;t too upset.  There are plenty of others to use in the packet.</li>
    <li> My budding nail tech daughter love them! They were well packaged, very reasonable in price and it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love mine and will be reordering to give away as gifts and as promotional products for my business!!! Amazingly helpful and creates gorgeous designs!!!</li>
    <li> These are so nice! They make perfect dots ad there is one that works like a tooth pick, they are so pretty too!</li>
    <li> My daughter likes doing her nails a couple times a week, so she asked for these tools to help with her designs.  She says they work great, and it was a great price</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy that my green tool was missing an end. (it didn&#x27;t break off during shipping, it came with and empty hole on one side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; but I do use the entire set still. its great even for drawing and lines, not just dots. Took a while to be shipped but I was definitely pleased with the purchase. :-)</li>
    <li> They work great, just as expected. They are all different sized with&lt;br /&gt;fun vibrant colors. they do amazing polka dots and straight lines.&lt;br /&gt;Very recommended</li>
    <li> it was broke before i got it, they are not well made and was a complete waste of my money. save your time and buy something better</li>
    <li> most of these are the same point on the end but that is okay so that i can do multiple colors at once. do not clean with acetone though. it made the colors wear off of the handles.</li>
    <li> Learning how to use them.  They do make a good dot with nail polish.  Can also make kind of a line</li>
    <li> I love this dotting pens.  Every size I need was included and I get so many complements on my marbleized nail art.</li>
    <li> I live in NY and I received it TWO weeks earlier than it was estimated. They are so cute and pretty easy to use, love them so much!</li>
    <li> Just as described. One side are the same size tips but the other side are different sized dots. Great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The dotting tools are good for nail art, but I agree with the other reviews. They are not all different sizes and at least two of them were the same size, but they are easy to use and they came in a week and a half early. Though I wish I could have had a way to track my order.</li>
    <li> I received my dotters yesterday, haven&#x27;t tried them out yet, but they look great.  Do make sure that you realize that one end on each is exactly the same size.  So, you will get 6 different sizes.  I don&#x27;t imagine needing any other sizes, so I&#x27;m not disappointed at all.  They seem like pretty good quality, especially for the price.  They took a while to get here, but it was within the estimated shipping time.  Overall, very happy with my purchase, and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Just received them today and can&#x27;t wait to use them. I will be doing many artsy designs with these!! Great purchase/investment for Nail techs or hobbyists!</li>
    <li> This is a really cool product. I will probably buy more from this website. It came very fast. Great Job(:</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> Um....these aren&#x27;t that great becausw they don&#x27;t really work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking everywhere for these. I got exactly what was described and it came well before the estimated arrival date. I&#x27;m so happy I bought these. It was definitely worth it(:</li>
    <li> Very good quality.  Our daughter got them for Xmas and has used them to make fancy nail designs.  She is quite happy with them.</li>
    <li> My product took at least two weeks to recieve. Along with the fact you can tell they are cheaply made, so far they havent fallen apart.</li>
    <li> Liked it but one broke but still working. ..</li>
    <li> is exactly like the seller say is very usseful for make desing in nails&lt;br /&gt;the quality of the product is perfect , come on time and in perfect shape&lt;br /&gt;too I recomend this one</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over a month and I still haven&#x27;t received this &gt;__&amp;lt; horrible I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever ordering again SO UPSET</li>
    <li> I got my pens after a delay which is why they didn&#x27;t get 5 stars. Yes, they are all the same size on 1 side, but can you really beat a few bucks for them? I have so much fun with them, and can&#x27;t wait to try new things!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. I do my nails all the time and like to do different styles often. These helps a lot with that. They took a while to get to me, but that&#x27;s okay. Lol at first I didn&#x27;t realize they came from Hong Kong. Anyways, I love them they help a lot, they work much better than the one i made. Def glad I bought &#x27;em! GREAT DEAL :))</li>
    <li> Very durable and do what they are made for. Great for the price</li>
    <li> I got it so pretty colors yay can&#x27;t wait to try them out</li>
    <li> This product took forever to come, but I love the different sizes, although one came apart, I can&#x27;t beat the price nothing a little super glue can&#x27;t put back together, great dotters!!!</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re cute and all, but the tips fell out as soon as i opened them , so now i have to figure out how to repair them .</li>
    <li> They got here quick, they are nice, and they were cheap! I love how they work and I am really glad I put my money into them!</li>
    <li> This pen set is everything I imagined it would be.  Ive been dotting myself into a frenzy.  Goodbye bobby pin...youve been replaced.</li>
    <li> I rate this product 5 starts!! I love it!! I&#x27;ve been wanting some of these for a while now. I recommend this product to EVERYONE!!!</li>
    <li> The dotting tools are a great product, the pricer when even greater and they arrived on time, overall great product and great value</li>
    <li> These are my best buy yet. I made little ornaments on my christmas tree nails. I made flowers and hearts. great quality.</li>
    <li> Does the job and is decent quality for the price!</li>
    <li> i love this you should totally buy it totally recommended if you make nail designs like me this will make it so much easier well t did for meee and i have created so many more with these helps full tools and also it has great variety of sizes.</li>
    <li> these dotting tools are a great product for an even greater price they are comfortable to work with for a long period of time</li>
    <li> all five were different colors, but as stated on the other reviews, the top side is all the same size.  but still, I saw these at Sally&#x27;s for 10$....Who needs ten different dotting sizes? I do nail art all the time and don&#x27;t even use the six it comes with.. BUY</li>
    <li> I have waited so long for this and it&#x27;s perfect. I love doing my nails its so fun. My sister lines it to.</li>
    <li> One was already broken when it showed up and they&#x27;re not all pink like the picture. I do like them, but also would like to return them if it wouldn&#x27;t take an entire month.</li>
    <li> No more using bobby pins. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re very lightweight and they look cute as well. I&#x27;m pleased with them. .</li>
    <li> Really like this product,  a few of the tips are the same size but can&#x27;t really beat the price.  Overall I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So far I love it .  I do my own mani and pedis. This makes a cute simple design. I&#x27;ve only made dots so far. But will go on youtube for more DIY NAIL suggestions. Good quality. Fairly quick shipping.</li>
    <li> These came very fast for free shipping, two weeks early. They work fine (good thing because I don&#x27;t know how&#x27;d they&#x27;d be able to mess this up), and for the cheap price they&#x27;re really nicely made.</li>
    <li> All my item go to me in one piece, and on time thanks</li>
    <li> I just got these dotting tools today, they&#x27;re very cool &amp; as described &amp; pictured above. My mom will love them! My only complaint is that the shipping was very very slow. It&#x27;s not like I live in China! I live in America. Standard shipping is 3-5 days, not 6-8. This was part of my mother&#x27;s birthday present, her birthday was 2 days ago! I check my orders daily &amp; this said \\&quot;shipped\\&quot; just a few hours after I bought it, DON&#x27;T MARK THE ITEM AS SHIPPED IF YOU HAVE NOT SHIPPED IT OFF YET!!! For the last 3 days I&#x27;ve been thinking \\&quot;those dotting tools will be here any day now\\&quot; nope. They just arrived this morning. I know I didn&#x27;t pay for expedited shipping, but it&#x27;s not like standard shipping is for an eternity. A little advice for the seller, send off the package as soon as you can, just to satisfy your paying customer &amp; once again, don&#x27;t mark the item as having been shipped off, if you have not shipped it yet! But other than the shipping issues it&#x27;s a good quality product for a good price. I just wish people were more punctual.</li>
    <li> Works amazing. They helped a lot!</li>
    <li> Dotting pens are exactly as they look in the picture. Great price and not a cheap product.&lt;br /&gt;I would deff recomend to anyone looking for dotting tools. Shipment even arrived ahead of time which is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;Ive already done my nails and absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> I love the colors of the pen set. And love the effect of marbleing. The dotting comes out great. Love all the dots and different sizes.</li>
    <li> This dotting tool works as expected. I purchased it for my daughter who draws designs on her nails hands free. Great for any artist or nail tech!!</li>
    <li> I am a professional nail technician and i live this it comes in different sizes and a variety of colours and does the job well</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for  will make designing nails lots easier in the future thanks for offering them to the public</li>
    <li> Great tools. They really make it easy to decorate your nails. Great variety in sizes.</li>
    <li> Had seen reviews on this product and now that I have tried them they work well, and are easy to use.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price</li>
    <li> I really loved it! Gonna order one for my daughter she really likes to do designs so I&#x27;m going to order some in couple days for her birthday❤️</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t do perfect dots without these.  Great product.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> i order this produck as gift for a girl friend it has not arived yet i have contested sell has not resonded yet i am up set that idid not get tracking info on it it the firts of April and order it feb 6 and has not arived yet this up set that was a gift and i am un a bull to gave it i will naver buy form this sell again i am so mad i am trying for a refund now and i gave know stars if i could will i have an update now after exjaing emails with the seller i got replacement of the order the person who i was gaving it loved i am happy now with it and the seller made and her happy</li>
    <li> Bit disappointed that most are the same size but I figured that would happen from reading everyones reviews. Oh well, they are easy to use!!</li>
    <li> She likes them, they work good.</li>
    <li> Omg...so if your a nail Diva like me... it is a MUST you get these. These are so much more helpful for me then trying to create dots or circles or any design for that matter with the tip brush. These pen sets helped me put clean dots on my nails. Even if my hand was a little shakey, the ball point on the edge of the pen was thick enough to hold my design in place. this is my first time buying the pens, and i like them. I am now interested to check out the other nail products you guys have for designs. I hate wearing plain nails, and i always try to make design or dots with the tip brush, but because the brush is so brittle sometimes its hard to keep the polish in tact! Love the pens. Definitely have a happy customer. will be ordering more sets in the near future. trying to build a larger collection for this summer. thanks again.</li>
    <li> i love these little tools. they make putting designs on my daughters and I&#x27;s nails easy and cute. plus I received them in about 2 weeks. pretty quick from what i was told in the first place. thanks.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are easy to use and easy to clean. If you&#x27;re just getting into nail art, these tools are a great way to get started.  They&#x27;re incredibly easy to manage and will make you look like a professional!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to finally have these dotting tools and attempt to do my own nail art.  I usually do my own nails and only go to a salon when I want art.  Now I can do some myself.  I have watched them carefully to see how they do it, and I&#x27;m sure it will take a little practice but these tools are exactly the same as the salon has.  I like that there are so many of them so I can do all different sizes and styles.</li>
    <li> These dotting pens work great...Great price, buy, and shipment was fair.  Each pen has 2 different size at each end...I Recommend.</li>
    <li> This product was for my daughter who loves fashioning her nails. Originally, we though that the paint would be inside the dotters but you have to dip it in the desired color. The dotters are thin which means that the paint you use will haave to be thicker. It takes time to actually get nice polka dots on your nails but soon, you will get used to it.</li>
    <li> Arrived within 2 weeks of ordering, comes in plastic for storing set together. Decent variety of small size dotting with 1 just pointed tip</li>
    <li> These came a week sooner than expected, which was very exciting. They&#x27;re alot smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be, which at first was disappointing, but I realized it was more convenient and alot cuter too! These dotting tools are so much better looking irl. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Definitely in my top 10 must have for nail design ... Trust me this nail art tool will make your life a lot easier.</li>
    <li> These took a little long to ship, but the price cannot be beat. Some of the dotting heads are the same size, but you do get a nice variety. I use them often and they always clean up well.</li>
    <li> One of the balls had fallen out when I received it, it was very easy to super glue back in. For the price of this item you cant really complain. They did however take over a month to ship so if you are in a rush for the product chose a different seller, these come from China.</li>
    <li> My dauhter finally has the tools to help her make the designs she needs. She was using bobby pins, but I kept on vacuming them up.</li>
    <li> Item was as described, was received right on time. It made a great gift for my sister who is learning to do nail designs.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I love to work on my nails and I would recommend this if you do as well.</li>
    <li> So happy these shipped earlier than expected! And they make perfect dots so I&#x27;m happy with them :) they&#x27;re different sizes and I like it.</li>
    <li> I love how they were super cheap! They also have 10 dotting parts, not just five! They take a long time to come in, but it&#x27;s totally worth it! They make perfect dots, and clean off really easily with nail polish remover! Great for nail design lovers, like me! :)</li>
    <li> Love these dotting tools for my nails. :) The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this kit is that sometimes I find that the tips break off. However, it is fairly easy to fix. Other than that, this is a great set of tools for someone who likes experimenting with nail patterns.</li>
    <li> I had to wait a while for them to arrive, but it&#x27;s kinda normal since they come from China and I live in Italy. By the way, when they arrived, I was so happy: they are so colourful and they are very cute, and they work perfectly. To try them I made two little flowers on my toes and my sister asked me if I had used stickers, because they looked perfect! They are just perf and for the price really really worth it! :)</li>
    <li> Anyone who is into nail art needs dotting tools. These have a variety of different size dots to choose from. They&#x27;re inexpensive and work perfectly.</li>
    <li> They work great and I use them all the time to do my nail art with. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Good for the price but falls apart after awhile</li>
    <li> Did the job and cute, too! Love nail art. Lots of sizes, sturdy, easy to hold steady.</li>
    <li> I must say, I am not a pro when it comes to nails, but other than making polka dots I have no use for these tools.  I did get them at a reasonable rate, but really what else can be done with them.  Leave these for the professional manicurist.</li>
    <li> The only downside was that it took a while to get to my house, but the wait was well worth it! The delivery time was balanced with the amazing price. I got a multi-colored set, double sided like in the picture. On one side there are a variety of sizes and on the other side of all of them is a medium size. It works perfectly, the dots are perfect, and nothing has fallen apart, it is very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I totatly forgot that I had ordered this, but the dotting tools came in and they work great. I love the various sizes andthe different ideas that I&#x27;ve coe up with. Packaging was awesome as well...comes in its on carrying case.</li>
    <li> Good price and practical.</li>
    <li> Terrible quality. The tips of these dotting pens broke off during regular handling and then the entire ends broke off- the plastic itself, just in a hanging case on a wall.</li>
    <li> These came after the brush i ordered. The only reason i gave them a 3 star because one of tools are loose other than that they work really good.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it the second time I use it three of them broke.</li>
    <li> My dotting tool are awesome. They came on time and I enjoy using them I had to order an extra set for a friend</li>
    <li> These came early and are overall a great buy for a beginner . Dont think your going to receive great quality ones or else you will be disappointed. You get what you pay for. One of the heads popped out but is easily put back in place. WARNING- The heads are much smaller points then you would think. Good for very small details not things like big polka dots.</li>
    <li> absolutely great. I Love them and use them all the time</li>
    <li> tips broke wouldnt really recommend but its your choice</li>
    <li> Sitting tools are cool...from big to little dots..my daughter has fun with them too...cool item for your nails.</li>
    <li> Its beautifully designed and comes with all sizes. I enjoyed making designs with all different sized designs.&lt;br /&gt;However one of the tools that came to me was broken. The tip was fallen off.. However there were multiple tools so I was not at loss!!&lt;br /&gt;With this price, its worth a buy :)</li>
    <li> These tools are great for doing nail art and they are the cheapest price that I have found!</li>
    <li> Awesome, but they were smaller than I expected them to be.</li>
    <li> Do not work well at all.</li>
    <li> Make designing my nails so much easier! Very fast shipping</li>
    <li> They work really well and the dots do not run. I really enjoyed working with them on myself. I can hardly wait to use them on others.</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are great. The plastic is sturdy and the metal tips are smooth. I didn&#x27;t wait a month for them to arrive.</li>
    <li> All temps are so close to the same size that it&#x27;s silly to have included so many in the package.</li>
    <li> I received this set very quickly and was excited to try it. I was imagining all of the ladybugs, zigzags, stripes, animals, etc. I could paint on my nails. Well, I&#x27;m not very artistic and it shows on my nails lol. The tools are great but they aren&#x27;t magic! If you have a steady hand and patience to really concentrate, these tools will help you create all the designs I can only dream about :)</li>
    <li> This product works nicely and is a steal for the price!  Got myself and my niece each a set and we love it! Each end has a different size ball to make perfect dots of different sizes.</li>
    <li> These are a great value!  The have all the sizes you need and are of really high quality.  A great value!</li>
    <li> I bought these bc I wanted to see how they work.. I got them and did my nails and they work great nice dotting tool easy to handle they have different sizes to choose from.. I really like these dotting nail art tools..</li>
    <li> worked perfectly. look fun and do exactly what I want. After a time the metal part of the tool started to fall out and I had to super glue it back on.</li>
    <li> I wished they had more different dots. Id say 3 out of all of them were jst a tad bigger then the rest but mainly all the same size. But still gets the job done for the most part</li>
    <li> Fun for doing nail art at home!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves having polka dots on her nails and these have a great variety of sizes to make the dots. I like doing a larger dot one color, then a smaller dot within it a different color.&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to clean and are pretty. They are inexpensive and don&#x27;t take up much room in my nail polish area.&lt;br /&gt;Great for people just wanting to experiment with their nails and not pay salon prices!</li>
    <li> Got these in the mail and was surprised of the quality. I know it takes awhile for shipping but if you don&#x27;t need it right away its better to save some money! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are great, they are small and comfortable in your hand making it easy to dot precisely where you want to.  The sizes are all varied so that you can use just the right size dot in each application you choose.</li>
    <li> Not as pictured.  All the tools are pink, but at least I got different sizes. I think having the various colors would help identifying the dot dizes.  Any ideas on how to label the tools?</li>
    <li> They come with many sizes and they work well to help with the placement of the colored  rhinestones.! ! !</li>
    <li> I am a grandmother who ordered these pens for my granddaughter, who is VERY talented at nail art. She really wanted them in her stocking, but was so disappointed to open her stocking and find no marbleizing dotting tools.</li>
    <li> New favorite way of decorating nails! I love these! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I ordered these as a Christmas gift.  There are 5 pens but like others have said there are not 10 different sizes.  Also, all of my pens came in the same color, I was expecting a variety as shown.  There was no place to choose a color but I got all pink, which would have been my last choice of the colors shown.  I feel that the seller should have been more specific in the description.  I won&#x27;t return them but they also were not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Nice and convenient .</li>
    <li> I bought it for my sister as a gift and she likes it very much. the quality is good and they paint symmetrical dots :)</li>
    <li> i didnt think i would use these as much as i do, i never do my nails without a design anymore!</li>
    <li> I got it in perfect condition</li>
    <li> I love the fact that these are not the same size.</li>
    <li> Love these tools. Perfect for making dots on my nails. Easy to handle as well. I just wish I could find them locally.</li>
    <li> I just got these today very surprised ,because it came a bit early. If you look at the picture very closely you could see the other end all the same and the other end different sizes SO CALM DOWN! it was like what 3 dollars. I am very happy with the product. very easy to use, simple size i love it! The only thing i didn&#x27;t like is the shipping i know its from Hong Kong which is a different continent i live in but it took a month.... woah.... but if your pretty patience then i guess this is for you!</li>
    <li> The bigger ends arent to bad but the small ones wont seem to dot, dont know if its because they dont hold much polish on them or what but they wont dot</li>
    <li> The price on these alone should encourage you to buy, amazing! I bought these for my mother, not for her nails but for some art that she does and she was SO excited! I didn&#x27;t realize that the set came with a carrying case but it&#x27;s just awesome that it does! There&#x27;s no way she&#x27;s losing any of these!</li>
    <li> Love nail art and these dotting instruments have added to my creativity. The product arrived in good timing and before Christmas!</li>
    <li> I bought several of these for stocking stuffers and it was exactly what I expected. Everyone was happy. thank you.</li>
    <li> Good value, good price,  have gotten lots of use, very sturdy, none broken yet. Easy to use, fun to use.</li>
    <li> I thought this had nail polish in it. It&#x27;s a tool set!!  It&#x27;s just a metal pointed with different size dots. I know I can apply polish to the end and then put it on my nail.  Just remember to wipe it of.</li>
    <li> They look great! Only one side of each dotting pen is different but I don&#x27;t mind there are plenty of varying sizes.</li>
    <li> With these dotter I am able to make so many new designs on my nails with ease because of the multiple sizes!</li>
    <li> you get in the package 5 dotting pen set, different points in all of them, the only difference that I receive is the color of them was the same. I receive pink ones, but different sizes in them. So for the price is good.</li>
    <li> These are great for doing any kind of poka dots or flowers or whatever creative things you wanna do to your nails! It&#x27;s nice how it comes with different ones and different sizes for doing designs. Good product highly recommended for anyone who loves having cute nails! (:</li>
    <li> These work great for nail art! There are different size dots so you can do all sorts of things. They work great for other things too. My mom keeps stealing them to decorate cookies and paint with, so I went ahead and bought her her own set. She was so happy. I am very please with this product, and have recommended them to many of my friends.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for not only my daughter but also my nieces and they all loved this product.  They couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out and the endless possibilities for design.</li>
    <li> I am very happy. product came faster than expected and does exactly whats it ment for. Great quality for the price</li>
    <li> they are great and are all different sixes and the have two different ends. they come in the colors shown and came around stated time. Thanks very Much!</li>
    <li> So happy I got these. It makes dotting on the nails so much easier. No more using a pencil point here...LOL. Dottie dot dot dot:)</li>
    <li> They look exactly as pictured. High quality like the more expense nail dotters found in beauty and nail supply stores.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughter and she loves them. They are just as they were described. Nothing more, nothing less.  I tried to pull out one of the metal tips from the acryllic and it wouldn&#x27;t budge, which is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I really love this dotting pen set! I am not good at making nail designs free hand, but these make it so easy!</li>
    <li> I Absolutely Love These#! I Think Some Sizez Are The Same But They Get The Job Done!# Yay For These!!</li>
    <li> Thank You!!!  They match my other stuff i ordered from somebody else so thats a plus!!!  Thank You will do business again</li>
    <li> My girls love to paint their nails and create designs.  They had no idea about these tools so I surprised them with these excellent price tools.  They love these and are improving their art.</li>
    <li> Great product, works very well. Arrived in good time. Good quality product, made very well! I would recommend these as a great tool for a numerous amount of art projects.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are great they have different dotting sizes and have two different dot sizes on each end. Shipping wasn&#x27;t fast but they came and not broken, so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> These work great! I can make designs on my nails, just like at the salon! I use them on my daughter&#x27;s nails too!</li>
    <li> these tools are not just great for nail but also painting as well. but I mostly love these tools for the price i got them for.</li>
    <li> For 2 dollars these are incredible! Im not a big fan of pink but ill deal since they work great. I use them for sculpting and my nails. I like that every one has one side thats the same on each tool so if i want that size And a bigger size I just have to flip it around. Fast shipping, got here almost two weeks before expected date. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> The colors of the dotting pens, led me to believe that each pen contained the nail polish of the specified color.  Not so!  They are just pen points.  The gifted recipient was a bit disappointed that grandma did not know what she was buying.  Not much of a creative gift.</li>
    <li> It is a great tool for nail art!&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use, can do a lot more than just dots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting to receive my purchase \\&quot;( When I receive my item , I will be happy to do another review .</li>
    <li> My daughter ordered these and they were not what she was expecting. This is mostly our fault for not knowing exactly what they were when she ordered them. But the biggest disappointment is the quality of these pens, they were fairly cheap and now we can see why!&lt;br /&gt;There are two of these pens that the metal tips just fall out of the plastic handles. Then there are a couple others that are loose but at least they don&#x27;t just fall out. The old saying is...\\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;...I guess that is true!</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are beautiful. Beautiful handles and a variety of ball sizes for dotting.  It shipped from China so the estimated delivery date seemed far off, almost a month for expected delivery.  It came in 10 days and even the nail salon that I frequent was impressed and ordered 20 sets on the spot from my laptop!  Enables a creative and imagineable person to make gorgeous designs, not just dots but flowers and sprays as well.</li>
    <li> Just got my set today. They are very easy to use, light weight, great price. Perfect all the way around. I opened mine up as soon as they got here and started using them. I am so very pleased with this product! 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! I used them for over a year with no problems. Recently, one of the metal parts came out when I dropped it, but that&#x27;s okay because they&#x27;re double sided. I recommend these highly!</li>
    <li> I love these dotting pens.  They are very pretty and functional.  The only negative is that one of the tips has come off but just plugs back in. It only came off as I was cleaning it.  I&#x27;m sure if I just put a bit of glue or silicone in there it will be fine.  For the price, they are worth it.</li>
    <li> Amazing dotting tools. I love the variety of sizes on these. Very sturdy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I like these better than the  brushes</li>
    <li> Since I won&#x27;t know until Christmas how they really do I have no reason to doubt they are OK.  I&#x27;m hoping the will be fun to go with the nail polish sets I ordered for my great granddaughters.</li>
    <li> omg so fun i have done so many different designs love all the different sizes- only thing i think would be easier to handle if not so thick</li>
    <li> Pieces that arrived are not the same color as the picture, and are made with low quality plastic. That said, they do what they are supposed to do, and come at a good price.</li>
    <li> They have come in handy very happy with it</li>
    <li> they are ok. don&#x27;t really do a good job equalizing the size of the dot compare to other dotting pens i have.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Great pens for the price one pen will cost what the set cost at a beauty supply store; same pens they use at the nail salons.</li>
    <li> Great purchase for a good price, they work Well and are juSt what I wanted (:</li>
    <li> Arrived much quicker than expected and exactly what my daughter wanted &amp; needed for cosmetology class!</li>
    <li> Very useful tools, for the price i find it a great deal but you can do better if you want to spend a few more dollars for a higher complexity design</li>
    <li> Took a little bit of time to arrive but was worth the wait!</li>
    <li> LOVE! Work great and can make some amazing designs!!:)</li>
    <li> Got these for my nail tech as a little thank you gift. She loves them. Very cute and very well made</li>
    <li> Shipping was bad! They broke like nothing waste!</li>
    <li> Perfect, innexpensive nail art tools!! Easy to clean as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the f&#x3D;price, one tip comes out but a little glue fixed. These are great. I use for nails, clay, arts and crafts, embossing. So worth it.</li>
    <li> Just like the ones they use in the nail shop. These are sturdy and help  make good designs.</li>
    <li> These tools work great but the mailing time from China makes it a bit of a wait!</li>
    <li> These were a very handy. I liked the results of putting on jewels to dotting on paint and nail polish. I was very happy with my ending result, so this product is well worth your money!!!!</li>
    <li> Everything they are cracked out to be!!! I admit I was overly excited to buy them. But I was not disappointed when they came. They work as well as they should and are super easy to use</li>
    <li> i love it came like displayed comes in 1-2 weeks and perfect for designs</li>
    <li> These work great and were a great deal. My daughter and I use them often and they have held together great. Get them!</li>
    <li> I love these..doing creative nail art now..</li>
    <li> Great way to design your nails</li>
    <li> I agree with all of the other reivews... mine are exactly the same size, unlike pictured. It&#x27;s helpful if you are doing multiple colors and want the same size dots, but I really wanted different sizes &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I really like what I can do on my nails! I get compliments all the time. You don&#x27;t get a variety of tip sizes, but I&#x27;m happy with it and I definitely like the price. They are easy to use, and you can get a good grip on them so you have a lot of control over making your designs.</li>
    <li> These are great!!!! I got them faster than expected and they are so beautiful! They arnt too light or too heavy they are perfect. And the design is great!</li>
    <li> I saw a friend of mine having so I searched here and found this one. well I can say that this nail art pens works and I am happy with it considering that I did not spend so to have this nail art pens and I find it worth it.</li>
    <li> I like these as a backup dotting set, but have had to glue all of them back inside of the handle. Normally, I would not complain because I use my tools a lot and they do wear out, but I had only used the set once when the ends started coming loose. Otherwise, the dots are all different sizes and the handles are the perfect weight. For the price, I would buy them again ;0)</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, really.  They&#x27;re good quality dotting pens, but there aren&#x27;t as many sizes as it would appear. I think I got 3 different pens &amp; the rest were repeats.  They do the job, though.</li>
    <li> it was a very good purchase</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and a great product. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this at all.</li>
    <li> you get 6 sizes because one side is the same for all, nevertheless you get all the sizes you will ever need. Great buy!</li>
    <li> These are great for applying tiny drops of glue to paper toys. They came with one end being different sizes while the other end is the same side.</li>
    <li> i love doing design&#x27;s on my nails and this is a very helpful tool! i have told all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Great tool, arrived a few days early and works great.</li>
    <li> I have to say im impressed with these dotting tools!! They are great price and work amazing, now i can do perfect dots on my nails!! Really recommend!(:</li>
    <li> I used these to decorate my nails with many many different designs and i love them!! Theyre all different sizes!</li>
    <li> the price was extremely cheap, i am very happy with my purchase. convenient for the different sizes that come in the pack.</li>
    <li> These are really nice dotting tools, but unfortunately mine are all pink with basically the same sized dots on each one.</li>
    <li> i couldnt find instructions anywhere online or with the product they do not work at all if you dont know how to use them</li>
    <li> My 9 year old picked these for a birthday present. We used them as soon as they got here and she was very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> The different size allows you to create mant desogns on your nails.  I would have given it five stars but one end on my pink utensil fell out.  Nothing a little super glue can&#x27;t handle. It&#x27;s like brand new and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great price! Fast shipping! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> These are amazing! They make doing nail art so much easier. They have so many different uses, and I love using these when I do my nails!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT, IT CAME IN GREAT SHAPE IT WORKS SO GREAT AND IT DIDNT HAVE ANYTHING BAD I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Good price, takes awhile to get as it comes from China. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> These tools work great! They are so much easier to use than a toothpick, and they are very inexpensive as well as cute!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and gives you good design control.  The different colors work with a bunch of different nail polishes.</li>
    <li> This product  makes so easy to put dot on the nail!!!! It has different size for me to choose and it is cheap!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The product received is exactly as the description says. The handles are also in cute different colors to identify the different sizes easier.</li>
    <li> get them!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very cheap&lt;br /&gt;can do details&lt;br /&gt;so so so so so so many designs you can do&lt;br /&gt;10 different size dotters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;none really. once i got past user error, they are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did get all 5 different colors, so no complaint on that. and i have all different sizes, so i can do a lot with them.</li>
    <li> Although these took a month to arrive - despite the fact that I was informed that they would arrive for Christmas - we are very happy with these. There are great size options and they are made from sturdy materials.</li>
    <li> On top of waiting almost 3weeks for my item, they&#x27;re poor quality. I was better off using a  toothpick or</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. If you are using it for home use, you can do the same thing with tooth picks or ball point pens. When we opened this product one of the dotters was also broken. I would not recommend this product for the average person to use for in home use for your own nails.</li>
    <li> These are so handy!  I don&#x27;t know how I managed before I had them.  They make my nail art so much better and I love the variety of sizes.  They are exactly as described, and way cheaper than any I could buy locally.  I would purchase from seller again and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Overall pretty good except I got all the same color --pink. I wished they were in different colors as shown here. I read the reviews and some mentioned they only got 6-7 different sizes instead of ten. I decided to give it a try and  I did get different sizes, all ten. I guessed it was by luck. Haven&#x27;t try them yet but for $5, I think they ok.</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t need so many sizes, but I have found other uses for them. Painting (as in art paintings), crafts and especially for embossing. They charge like $5-$7 for embossing stylus&#x27; and that&#x27;s exactly what these are, just mulitsized!</li>
    <li> LOVE THAT THEY ARE DOUBLE-SIDED!!CAME IN PRETTY PASTEL COLORS!!GREAT QUALITY AND CAME IN PERFECT CONDITION.CAME SOONER THAN EXPECTED!ARE SO PRETTY.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve tried a few designs on my nails using this instrument. I recommend checking out YouTube videos to get ideas on how to use it. Great price too!!</li>
    <li> They are great. Really pretty design, and a lot of size options. Amazing deal for the price. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> i am very disappointed, the dotting tools are all the same size. i ordered these thinking they were all different just as the picture shows, so i am not at all happy with the dotting tools. and above all they have HORRIBLE customer service, i will never again buy from them, and i do not recommend buying from them, you can find the same items with other sellers, trust me save yourself the hassle and buy from a different seller!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these tools they are sturdy and good</li>
    <li> I got two of these, one for my daughter and one for my neice. They are great!! Heavy, good quality. I feel like I got a great deal!</li>
    <li> These are going to my granddaughter for christmas, but I am sure she will love them. They were delivered quickly and were exactly as shown. Great price and reasonable shipping costs.</li>
    <li> Worked as stated. Came at a good time. Better than using bobby pins. Good price and lasts long time  :)</li>
    <li> these are so easy and fun to use, but def designed to make designs as dots. dont intend to try to make straight lines.</li>
    <li> I really like how many options there are for dotting. Very good. Thinking I should get a few more for some friends. I would recommend this product to those interested in nail design!</li>
    <li> With the nail art, that my daughter and I do, this was a must. The price was just right..or even better then I could find them out. These are a must for anyone that loves nail art like we do.</li>
    <li> daughter was very happy to receive these for Christmas in her stocking.  She loved using them already too. Good gift.</li>
    <li> The picture clearly show 5 different sizes, but the ones I got were all the same size. :( Don&#x27;t waste your money on these unless you&#x27;re okay with that. I will be returning these and using the money towards a better set.</li>
    <li> These are perfect, colorful and so useful for anyone who enjoys nail art or who wants to start getting in to it. I use them with both nail enamel and acrylic paint and they work great! They are easy to keep clean and use. My boyfriend got me these and I love them!</li>
    <li> I just received mine and I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to use them.  Do I have to break the top off?</li>
    <li> Very cute , different sizes . But the sizes are very simular , if the sizes werent so much simular i would love it even more !! (:&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars .</li>
    <li> Well I purchased these for a friend at work to go with a nail care basket that I got her for our office pollyana and she loves nail stuff as do I. I figured it would be win win bcuz she gets something new and I would too bcuz I could borrow it. She loves them...me on the other hand... well I can&#x27;t really get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> this tools are amaizing to draw your nails, there are perfect to do cicles in all sizes. Really amaizing, I recomend it</li>
    <li> A fun way to spend the afternoon playing with nail art.  Now I just need to go buy more polish and sparkle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard of dotting tools for nail design, so I wanted to try them. I tried it once, and the design was alright. Don&#x27;t have the patience for this kind of stuff. So it&#x27;s just OK for me.</li>
    <li> it is very hard to talk to the company. (can not reach them) i will never buy any products from this company</li>
    <li> i got my dotting tools almost 2 weeks earlier than est. delivery time! Reading other customer&#x27;s review prior to buying this product, I already know that instead of 10 different sizes, there are technically only 6 different sizes because its the same size on the other end on each one. But for $1.90 who cares?  It&#x27;s still a great deal. They all came in once piece and I just use them and they work well. Very satisfy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchsed these for my 11 year old niece( gonna be 12) for her B-day. I kinda played with them, but I will say that these tools DO have different sized &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; on the ends, so I think it will make painting nils for her and her g-friends VERY easy and they are able to get different designs USING Them</li>
    <li> 3 stars for ordering the pink and getting the multicolored tools. But at least they&#x27;re not all the same size as some reviewers have commented. One side has all the same size dots, and the other side as different sizes. So 6 different sizes in all. Haven&#x27;t used them yet so I can&#x27;t comment on how long they will last.</li>
    <li> And they are GREAT!!! I absolutely love these. Love that there are different sizes and it&#x27;s exactly what was shown on the picture. No surprises and works terrific!!</li>
    <li> These are beautiful just like the picture and what I payed I wish I had bought more. I have used them and they work great and clean up easily.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the products to be so easy to use but the dotters are extremely easy to use for making nice designs on my nails. I love all the different sizes, the price I paid for the product, and the speed in which it came.</li>
    <li> This was really cheap and I got every size that I needed! I also love the colors! It was a great purchase!!!</li>
    <li> The day I opened this package one of the pens was already broken but since this product was so inexpensive I didn&#x27;t expect much. I did use these to make different sized dots on my nails and it was really helpful for that. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> My wife likes them, puts a finishing touch on her nails.</li>
    <li> use for various stuff</li>
    <li> I am so happy to get these dotting tools and well before the estimated time of arrival. Of the five tools I got two of them are the same size but no big deal. For the price and the fact that there was no tax and no shipping fee.. who cares?? I wanted tools for big dots medium dots and small dots.. so I got what I wanted. I just ordered this exact set for my sister since I got such get customer service and I will be purchasing from this seller again ,</li>
    <li> these give you plenty of sizes to work with- whether you want large dots or tiny ones, you get it all. love that you get alot for the price.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s fun for my daughter we do each others nails and it&#x27;s very easy to pack in a plastic bag</li>
    <li> She loves the designs.  When she goes to school, all the kids want her to do them.&lt;br /&gt;She will be getting more of this.</li>
    <li> These are so great! I bought them after a person who does nail tutorials also used them. Easy to use and handle and easy to clean!</li>
    <li> My daughter has had so much fun with this product. It is easy to use and works great... we love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the dexterity to paint the greatest dots ever but when this was about $2, I snatched it. It&#x27;s been great &amp; provides a variety of dot sizes. My husband was concerned when it came straight from China but we&#x27;ve enjoyed this product &amp; are glad we purchased it!</li>
    <li> The set came in a cute little carrying case..there are a range sizes from the tiniest most delicate dots to the big dots for making flower centers. The tools have a substantial weight and don&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy in you hands. You get a total of 6 different sizes...one side of the tools have the same size ends as the others. That isn&#x27;t a problem because I don&#x27;t think you can ever need another size dot ever.....There was nothing broken or faulty with my package....if I break any of these I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I like to do my nails but when i try to dots with my nail art pens and brushes i mess up my nails thats why I like to use dotting tools but when it takes to long to get here thats when I get mad and I payed money for it BUT IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT TO USE WHEN MAKING DOTS!!!</li>
    <li> Got them for cheap and they arrived quickly. They came as described by the seller. and I have an urge to just use them to put dots on everything. lmao wondering if i can hold a dog long enough to do their nails...</li>
    <li> I Got these yesterday and I fell in LOVE with these omg their just so pretty, I tried them and they are amazing and so cheap. :D</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;d recomend it to any girl who loves to do nails! it works perfectly on any nail size.</li>
    <li> Cute dotting pen set that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I love the different sizes so I can make lovely dotticures.</li>
    <li> One of the dotting ends was loose but that is nothing a little dab of superglue won&#x27;t fix. They arrived in just over a week which is SUPER fast for something coming from Hong Kong. I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected.</li>
    <li> I just got them, did take them a while to get to me but it&#x27;s understandable considering it said they came from China but I am in love with them, I use them for my nails and my polymer clay creations :) Inexpensive as well, happy with my product.</li>
    <li> Great price! I can use these dotting pens to create so many things! I&#x27;ve used them for art work on other projects not just nail art. They work fine.</li>
    <li> Fun and had an excited niece!</li>
    <li> Love these dotting tool set, so easy to make designs on the nails. I would so recommend this to everyone who loves to do nail art.</li>
    <li> They work pretty good. I use them on my toddler&#x27;s toes when she wants the polka dot look. They do the job.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know why people are complaining about the sizes! it comes with 6 reasonable sizes! and for the price?!!?!?! Thats absolutely just fine with me!!! and it came at a reasonable time!!! totally recommend this.(:</li>
    <li> they were package nicely in  they were package nicely in a cute plastic container I love  them.each of the pens are sized differently</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have these... been using them a lot and they are so much fun!!  They also came earlier than I thought they would and I&#x27;m grateful for the wonderful service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy I bought these. So many things you can use it for and it&#x27;s only $2 bucks! Can&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
    <li> I received varied sizes, but I don&#x27;t really like pink and I received all of mine in pink.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I can do all kinds of nail art now and there&#x27;s so many different sizes. Works great!</li>
    <li> Love the product I&#x27;ve used them they work well.</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I was expecting to get.  These dotting pens looked great and I can&#x27;t wait to get started using them.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the pens I brought they work very well and they are easy to use the only problem I had with them is when I got them in the mail one of the end where missing and I message them about there product and I have got answer</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> They work great and they look great too! I recommend buying!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly how described</li>
    <li> dots dots and more dots</li>
    <li> I found them good for me.Low price a plus</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I love these! They do their job. The end! :)</li>
    <li> They are good and do what they need to do but if you watch nail art videos and want to do a good job, you have to have the skills not just the tools, if you know what I mean.  It seems easy to make a dot with the dotting pen but if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand you&#x27;ll still struggle.</li>
    <li> This product got to my house way faster than what I expected. The packet came with a cute small letter and the dotting tools look sturdy. I haven&#x27;t has the chance to test them out but by the looks of them they look like they&#x27;re going to create many awesome looks. Can&#x27;t wait. I would definitely buy from here again.</li>
    <li> these are such cute things.&lt;br /&gt;i love it. the dotters are so adorable, and the way that they&#x27;re made, you can definitely tell that they are not cheap stuff.</li>
    <li> These tools are absolutely perfect for anyone who loves doing there nails. These specific nail dotters are very nice, and easy to clean! They habe so many different uses then just dots! I have used them to make flowers on my nails, lines, hearts and so much more. I recommend these for everyone!</li>
    <li> Purchased these different size tip pens for nail artwork.  At first you might feel they don&#x27;t work, but you will find the pens are great with some practice on your part.  Would recommend the purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend got them and she seems to really enjoy them, I would recommend To everyone who likes designing nails.</li>
    <li> My tools came in all one color. I have no problem with that but the photo does suggest they are multi colored. Having them multi colored would help with quickly identifying sizes.</li>
    <li> I like the colors and I can make dots on my nails and flowers with them, the price is awesome</li>
    <li> I bought these for my girls to decorate their nails. My husband made off with them, noting they are a better selection and better quality than the sculpting (he sculpts in clay) tools he orders from our local art store. I&#x27;ll be ordering another set!</li>
    <li> Great quality, Great price. I reccomend &amp; would buy again :). . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I have these on my wishlist for a while now but, I had held off on buying them because I was waiting for my local beauty supply store to restock theirs. Obviously I was impatient! I ordered these with a couple other things, which is probably why they took a little longer to be delivered. I had read some of the reviews about these being all the same size on one end, I however, don&#x27;t have this problem. They are all different sizes and seem to be sturdy. They all are pink though so, the picture is a little misleading. I can love with pink but, he different colors would have been helpful when remembering what size I was using. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. Would definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> One of the tips had fallen out of the tool but the ones that didn&#x27;t fall out worked great</li>
    <li> I had seen a lot of nail artists on youtube using these dotters, so I thought, why not buy them for myself? In general, they do the job fine. They make dots. There are, however, a few downsides to the ones that I ordered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The shipping time is LONG. Extremely long. Took a month to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Several of the dotting tips were not glued in, so they fall out if I try to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) 4 of the dotting tips are the same size, which means that you are not getting as many sizes as advertized. Luckily, the defecting dotting tips that I received were all redundant sizes. One fault makes up for another I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, they do the job and I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> Amazing tool. So many different options. They look and feel well made and the spirals are a bit trippy. Would recommend buying these.</li>
    <li> These had a lot of different size tips for nail detailing! They worked great for what I needed them for</li>
    <li> These are great! I love all the different sizes. You can do a lot with them! Good purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Where I live, it seems impossible to find these little tools.  Every time I go to the beauty supply store, they are out.  I saw these on Amazon and given the ridiculously low price, it was a no-brainer.  Please note: these tools arrived MUCH sooner than promised.  In case you are wondering, all of the tools feature bulbs on the end, with one being smaller than the other.  However, each tool is a duplicate of the next, so you are not receiving 8 different sized bulbs, but instead 4 tools with the same 2 bulbs.  Overall, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if you are using them for simplistic nail art.</li>
    <li> i expected it to be much better, and it was shipped wayyy before estimated ship date. it does help with dotting you nails and if you don&#x27;t know what to do search it up on youtube!</li>
    <li> Nice price &amp; came faster then the expected delivery date :-).  They are handy tools for making 6 different size dots. Would have given a 5 star if there were more sizes. But one end they all are the same size. So the discription wasnot right led me to believe I was getting 10 different sizes.</li>
    <li> Still learning all the things I can do with these but the are awesome they also came in with a little extra gift was so sweet</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for nails! It&#x27;s exactly as shown in the pictures too! I love how it has a cute like traveling holder! It&#x27;s a mist have!</li>
    <li> These work well. I am happy with them. I use them all the time, to put designs on my mothers toes.</li>
    <li> I received them and was so happy.  The blue dotter bottom piece broke completely off.  The yellow dotter had the metal piece slide out.  Not happy that now I have a broken product in such a short time and now will have to obtian replacements.</li>
    <li> For the price its something you cant complain about. They came when they were supposed too, the only sad thing is that one of the ends on the pink doting tool is loose and I had to secure it with a little nail glue that will hopefully hold.</li>
    <li> So many things you can Do with these tools. They arrived quickly. The nail art options are endless. I recommend these for everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but unforchantly there is no tracking information and it takes a lot of time to ship so that&#x27;s a big downer. But i wouldn&#x27;t worry about that because you get a wonderful product that lasts you a really long time and is inexpensive, and shipping is free!</li>
    <li> I am loving these tools. They are exactly what I need to bring my nail art to the next level</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these.  I had no idea what they were for but she uses them to decorate her nails and they come out fantastic.  Great item!</li>
    <li> Pretty different variety of dotting size.  Great for making flowers and other decorations as well on your nails.  I use with both UV gel nail polish and regular polish.</li>
    <li> works well i like how easy they are to use my kids like how easy pokodots are to make on their nails</li>
    <li> came like shown, shipping took forever.. i almost forgot about the item</li>
    <li> I was using toothpicks and other homemade dotting tools. Finally gave in and bought a set. Totally worth it. Love them.</li>
    <li> I just started to do my own nails.  I love to paint, and am a very detailed orientated person.  For the price of these nails pet set, made the deal seem almost to good to be true but it is true.  They are double tip&#x27;d , different sizes just like different brushes, will help you achieve a unique line/look for your nails.  Just dot, and dab.  It&#x27;s really that easy to use.</li>
    <li> Polka Dots made easy!  The tools are easy to use and have different sizes to customize a nail design.  Product was received as described.</li>
    <li> I chose 5 stars because the pens appear sturdy, cheap, free shipping, and cool looking in all honesty. Plus if you are bored or waiting for a text or something to load, you can twirl it around and be entertained. The product works great, a steady hand is just required.</li>
    <li> I really like these nail dotters! They we&#x27;re packed we&#x27;ll and are pretty . By the reviews they look like they would work for me :) but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Tip was not attached to one of the tools when received.</li>
    <li> nice to work with, can use  this product by yourself, Recommended  anyone that likes art  worked nails would like them.</li>
    <li> I was soo excited when I saw these online.  I do my nails all the time, and have been looking forever for a set of nail dotters! I received my items several weeks early!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t beat the price. Arrived quickly. Worked well. Only complaint is head of one of the tools can come out but does not cause any problems</li>
    <li> The dotting pens are really really great and so fun you can dot away big or small you can also see these at youtube.com GOD Bless.</li>
    <li> Thought I was going to get 10 different sizes,but I got six still like  that i have the tools now</li>
    <li> If one of them didn&#x27;t split in half on me. I was using one last week, and I don&#x27;t use a lot of presure. I use it like holding a pen or pencil. Well, it had split in half on me, but it&#x27;s not like it wasn&#x27;t fixable. I was able to super glue it back together. Other than that, it works on my nail designs!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these dotting tools and so many sizes to choose from. Go from polka dots to flowers to making goggly eyes. Designs are endless. Thank you for shipping so quickly and easy transaction.</li>
    <li> This set of 5 tools is great for dong your nails in the summer!!! i love them!!! its a great buy.</li>
    <li> If you love painting your nails I highly recommend dotting tools!! I love doing my own nails at home and doing different nail designs.</li>
    <li> Would be better if all 10 tips were different, but at this price I can&#x27;t really complain at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the design in the middle is fun :)</li>
    <li> These little tools are really nifty. They&#x27;re the same one&#x27;s the Cute Polish uses. They&#x27;re really pretty too. Great buy, Make sure you wipe of the nail polish from them with remover when you&#x27;re done or they&#x27;ll get all gunky.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails at home and these dotting tools are awesome and work very well!!!!! I would definitely purchase these again.</li>
    <li> These are the best for nail art!! I love them and use them almost every time that I do my nails! They are the best value, my only complaint is that one end of one of them wasn&#x27;t glued completely.. but for the price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Great price for fun nail tools. I think some of the ends are the same size, but the price makes up for that. I love using them for nail art.</li>
    <li> I love these and the different sizes of the dotting ends. They have made certain nail designs a bit easier for me since I got them. I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> These little tools are exactly what I needed. The make perfect dots, flowers etc. Prior to purchasing these I used toothpicks as a quick dotter but these are more precise. Thank you for the tools</li>
    <li> I am not a nail artist by any means, but these little dotting tools help! I had tried using household things, such as toothpicks and bobby pins, but these work better. And for that price, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
    <li> cheap, easy, fun, well made product.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered another set of these for some friends.&lt;br /&gt;everyone has fun using them.</li>
    <li> Grand kids really love this to do their nails. Easy to use and good quality product for the price. Thanks</li>
    <li> a lot of fun and easy to do use and to clean you can do so much more then dotting with these</li>
    <li> Just as expect it work for me</li>
    <li> it came in perfect condition and mine was even colorful still using them works great i have had them for a year now</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice n very easy art</li>
    <li> For some reason it came in five different colors and not in the pink it showed...but if you don&#x27;t mind it...it&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> Super cute. I ordered all pink but was pleasantly surprised when I got multiple colors. Shipping took a little longer than expected but I&#x27;ll live.</li>
    <li> HAD TO THROW THEM OUT DIDNT NOW HOW TO USE THIS ITEM</li>
    <li> my girls love these!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> as described. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These do just the trick. Thank you!</li>
    <li> there are 6 sizes total. Each all have one same side paired up with a different size.</li>
    <li> As a beginner with painting and decorating nails, these tools make it fun to come up with new unique designs</li>
    <li> Received these much sooner than expected, and love them.  The different sizes make it easy to really customize your nail art, and they&#x27;re super easy to use.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great for designs in nails, my daughter loves to use it when doing my nails and hers. Gets a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> my girls have a lot of fun with these tools great shapes to make would tell my friends about it</li>
    <li> Made some cute designs with them so far. There do seem to be repeated ends so 5 is probably more than necessary but it&#x27;s not really a big deal. I lose things all the time so that may just benefit me later. The one thing is that on one of the tools the dotter wasn&#x27;t fully secured in the base so it came right out, but some super glue will fix that I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> it helps in doing my case and putting some designs</li>
    <li> I seriously love these! They came in a nice package and they work beautifully! The only thing is that the white one only had one of the dotting things inside one side and the other was off. I had to hot glue it but it works fine now! I love them!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with doing my nails and I love making them look cute these are all different sizes and easy to use</li>
    <li> I read some pretty bad reviews of this product after purchasing.  Firstly, the dotting tools are advertised as 10 different sizes. When actually, on one end of each one, they are all the same.  I don&#x27;t care about that. I got this product for really cheap anyway.  I was so excited when I opened it...the company had put a little butterfly magnet in the package with my product!! It took a long time to get to me, as it was coming all the way from China.  It&#x27;s like the little butterfly magnet was a thank you gift for me for waiting ever so patiently for my product.  I will order from them again.  Thank you for my magnet!!!!!</li>
    <li> Gets the job done when needed; no complaints</li>
    <li> This was ordered for my daughter for her to experiment with doing her nails. Exactly what was advertised is exactly what we received</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughters and they love them!!  Very neat idea.  They love to do their nails!  Makes it fun!</li>
    <li> It took a while to get to my house but I had already know that it was going to take a while. It is made of good material and does what it&#x27;s need to do and more. I was worth paying a dollar for them plus it includes a case. So I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
    <li> I have nothing to complain about, the item arrived 3 weeks earlier than I anticipated (it takes a long while, just know that going in and you won&#x27;t be bummed). It&#x27;s sturdy, I can create precise nail designs, the dots are not globby/messy. My only complaint is they don&#x27;t label the sizes or anything, so I had to do that myself.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more eco- friendly way to make cool designs. I was using alot of toothpicks when I started my nail buisness, and my grandmother got tired of me taking her toothpicks. These tools look professional, and give great results in nail art. There are so many different things you can do with them. I love them.</li>
    <li> Really is a great product can not go wrong with this price either. The pen set is also super easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I ordered both the Dotting tools and nail art brushes an  they both work really well for a low price!! Love them. And the order arrived around 2 weeks before the expected date!!</li>
    <li> I have never considered polka dots before, but that are adorable!  I get compliments at least once a day. Found tons of ideas on Pinterest and other sites. This tool is easy to use and has different sizes on each end. They are exactly as pictured and came in a cheap, but handy carry case. Definitely worth the couple of bucks I paid for it.</li>
    <li> These are really great, and well worth the money, very happy I ordered them.  You will not be sorry here!</li>
    <li> Ive always wanted to try these tools to make dots and other designs on my nails. Ive finaly got to try them. I need practice other than that they are great!</li>
    <li> These are so cool, can&#x27;t believe got all of these 5 tools for so cheap and free shipping. Have done my nails twice already and can&#x27;t wait to do again and try some different designs. I have had several people compliment me on my poka dot nails. Must have for fashion! Love them.</li>
    <li> You really just get 6 sizes, but for the price it is good enough plus how big your nail can be!</li>
    <li> Great for dotting but doesnt work as well as I thought it would. You would have to use a lot of polish which is harder to execute when detailing. Marble is a little difficult. Great Price!</li>
    <li> These are great tools for doing designs on nails. I love the diversity they bring to different designs, I use them for much more than just dotting tools!</li>
    <li> I sent for the dotting pen set and got the wrong item.  I got a set of five different brushes, the handles look the same, but the opposite end of the brush looks like something you can push your cuticles down with.  I&#x27;m gonna keep the brushes, they are worth the 2 bucks I paid, and really not worth paying to send back.</li>
    <li> cheaply made, looks as though they were hot glued together.</li>
    <li> The dotting tools feel very sturdy, like others have mentioned only one side has real different sizes. They have 5 different sizes and they are great I can not wait to make some great nail art with it. I ordered these May 14 and got them May 29th, even though they said it would arrive between june 10th-26th.</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted really nice one thing i don&#x27;t really like is its hard to clean the nail polish off it but i still would reccomend buying this</li>
    <li> I am what some may call a nail-polish-addict. I am obsessed with buying nail polishes of all brands and colors, and for a while just a plain home manicure was enough for me. However, more and more I wanted to experiment with trying designs. These dotting tools are perfect, and especially for the price! While I&#x27;m still just an amateur nail artist, I found doing a simple dot-flower very easy to do, even on my right hand! I think I will definitely enjoy using these for a long time.</li>
    <li> shipping was fast and they were not broken, happy I order them, but they all didnt come in pink, it came in different colors.</li>
    <li> I loved my dot set.. People think I get my nails done at the shop. I just tell them..&amp;#34;No I did it myself and got them from amazon at a really good price&amp;#34;. I love shopping on amazon now!</li>
    <li> Polka dots in all sizes😍😍😍</li>
    <li> These are awesome for making different sized polka-dots and flower shapes.</li>
    <li> Several of the tools were the exact same tool rather than it being all of the tools shown here</li>
    <li> For the price &amp; coming from China, exactly what was expected and got the job done. Been using them for a few weeks now &amp; find new ways to use different sizes.</li>
    <li> Took a very long time to arrive and all the handles are pink. Different colors, as pictured, would make finding the correct sculpting tip easier. Other than that, they&#x27;re fine.</li>
    <li> Love these! Great for nail art and adding blind or decals</li>
    <li> They work they are very nice. Much smaller than i expected and not much variety on the dot size but they work great and clean up nice. I would buy from this vendor again. It comes from China so shipping is slow but dependable. I only gave it 4 stars beacuase of the size. Everything else is cool.</li>
    <li> It did not come with all the sizes in the picture. 7 of the ends are exactly the same size, there&#x27;s no big one, all of the balls on the tips of mine are very small.</li>
    <li> Came in good condition and I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> loved doing my nails with this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy, good seller, I will buy another time</li>
    <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
    <li> Really cute and work well.</li>
    <li> Great tools! Buy them! :D</li>
    <li> Thank you very much!!!!</li>
    <li> 2 of them were broken when I got these...</li>
    <li> Maded do my nail even easier.</li>
    <li> The worked great!!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> great item recommend this</li>
    <li> Bought this as a present to my friend who loves doing her own nails.  She said she loves them!  And when I went to the nail shop and saw the same products was being used by the nail person it made me smile.  Really strudy for nice a nice price.</li>
    <li> So happy! They came with every size i expected! Love these</li>
    <li> work good and good quality for great price</li>
    <li> Great products and shipping were fast</li>
    <li> Super cool! Love them!!! will purchase again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Shipment was on time. Great product.</li>
    <li> Love  these for the price it was great.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my younger sister and she uses them all of the time. She said they were easy to use, and much more effective compared to dipping a toothpick in nail polish and trying to apply gems, and polka dots. :)</li>
    <li> Perfect for designing the nails as expected</li>
    <li> use them all the time. super cute. and very useful for all you dotting needs lol great for making flowers and stuff</li>
    <li> This is the first set of dotting tools I have ever purchased and I am satisfied. I have used them with acrylic paint to do my nails and they turn out prefectly. I haven&#x27;t use with nail polish cause I don&#x27;t want to ruin them by not being able to clean them off as good as I can with the paint.</li>
    <li> I love these tools! My only problem with them is when you go to remove nailpolish from the ends the metal always breaks free from the plastic stick!</li>
    <li> one of mine was broken when I recieved it.</li>
    <li> I used these dotting pens not for manicure but to do art painting on wine glassed. I volenteered to paint 150 wine glasses for a charity and by using the dotting pens to make pokkadots&lt;br /&gt;or other designs saved time and gave me the exact design I was looking for. Love them and easy to clean up.</li>
    <li> i like these dotting pens...there were multiple sizes and are rather pretty but keep in mind they do come from hongkong so they will take a loooong time to get to you. Still, they do the job they were made for.</li>
    <li> I purchased the dotting tools and it hasn&#x27;t even been a week and the pieces are coming apart. I guess the glue there using is very cheap. Don&#x27;t Waste YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived in great shape, exactly like the picture. I would recommend anyone to buy it, it works great. It&#x27;s a fantastic gift idea.</li>
    <li> These are awesome dotting tools. I&#x27;m glad that I decided to purchase these. They don&#x27;t seem cheap and look to be very well made. There is a range of dotting sizes for pretty much any design that you would need to make. If you are wanting to purchase some dotting tools, then you should definitely purchase these!! Enjoy dotting!</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t NEED dotting tools, you can use toothpicks, or straight pin heads or anything spherical...&lt;br /&gt;But these do make life easier and prettier and you feel less primative using this hee hee.</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed with this product. I bought it as little stocking stuffer for my niece who has been getting into nail art. I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll be able to figure out how to use it even without instructions.  However, the product picture displayed a pack of various colors. All I got was pink.  All of them were PINK.  Like others said - luckily it wasn&#x27;t that expensive. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying anything from this supplier again.  Ugh.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a friend and she was THRILLED with them. They we inexpensive enough to be a &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift and she was really excited about them so they served their purpose perfectly. I haven&#x27;t heard from her whether or not they&#x27;ve held up but she seemed to think that they were just what she was looking for.</li>
    <li> Bought for my preteen. She loves it. My toes are done right now.</li>
    <li> Love them!!! Got to me in a timely matter and very excellent quality!!!</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter because I has seen her trying to use toothpicks to create designs on her nails! She really loved them and has used them several times already! Good item and good value.</li>
    <li> The product serves its purpose and was a great buy. I would recommend this item. Also, the product is high in quality.</li>
    <li> Very pleased, and these tools work great! ;) Also, because they&#x27;re metal, the clean up process is easy... When nailpoish is on the heads of the dotting tool, just get nailpolish remover and clean them off. I&#x27;m so happy I recieved 10 different sizes of dots I can choose from to make some really cool flower designs, lines, and even shapes on my nails. I&#x27;ll never have to go to a nail salon any more, or buy nail stickers, because my nail salon is right at home and it makes me proud to say I even did by own nails any nobody else did or I didn&#x27;t buy stickers to get an awesome design :)</li>
    <li> ive been looking store to store and glad i bought this product at an affordable price will shop again soon</li>
    <li> They worked just fine</li>
    <li> I ordered this along with my LA Colors Nail Art Polish Set so I could achieve some nice dotted designs but this product first of all came with some of the same size dot on more than one of the tools. I am glad I got it for this price because it can&#x27;t really be beat but I am really disappointed with the quality and make of the porduct. :(</li>
    <li> So, I had ordered this product and it did come. Shipped Dec 28th, arrived Jan 14th. And I was at first dissapointed that the tips on three of them were the same size, I was happy either way. I guess they saw my review and of course they want the best reviews possible, contacted me. Even asking me if I would change the review. Well I said sure I would change it, Since they made every effort to ensure my happiness. They will be sending me out a new one. So, let&#x27;s see what happens. Thank you. L.E.</li>
    <li> The title speaks for itself. The set is great and I use them in almost every nail art design. Awesome!</li>
    <li> Great price! These are great for creating little dots, flowers or whatever you want. several different sized &#x27;tips&#x27; with some being balls, and others being more of a pointed tip shape.  I really like the feel, and quality of these. I&#x27;m using them for Shellac Gel nails and they are great!</li>
    <li> the dotting set comes in this great little convenient plastic case that i&#x27;m still using to keep them in and a multitude of sizes. i do wish that the biggest dotting pen was a little bit bigger but it&#x27;s still a good size. i feel as though a lot of the sizes of the dotting pens are the same, though, but i have all i need. all in all it is great for the price!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works well and it&#x27;s comfortable to hold.  Not all of them are different sizes but I love them.</li>
    <li> My five year old and I love spending out Sunday afternoons designing her nails. We use these tools for little hearts and of course polka dots.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter, she loves them!</li>
    <li> They are very pretty that&#x27;s why I purchase them they are all different sizes and they work great for mani pedi parties</li>
    <li> I dont believe the description says 10 different sizes, it says 5x2 in the tittle. it is 5 different sizes, the small ones are doubled. still a great dotting tool. descent shipping time, it arrived from china.</li>
    <li> They have different sizes and I just got them today it makes it easier to make dots with I can&#x27;t wait until I get my brushes</li>
    <li> I like the product a lot and it works really well but when I got it in the mail one of the heads was already loose and I could pull the head in and out. Not a big deal because it can be fixed with super glue but I just expected it to be in perfect condition since I did buy a new product and not a used one. Besides that everything is well and the shipping was really fast. I would recommend this product much more if part of it was not already broken, manufacturing should fix that.</li>
    <li> Just received these in the mail and two of them are broken. Cheaply made.</li>
    <li> i really loved it! it is really cool! Very nice! So neat! Wow amazing Wow! Liked it bunches! So neat!</li>
    <li> i like the colors and i like the feeling of it in my hands but its hard to design i constantly have to dip it in the nail polish</li>
    <li> This package did take a while cuz it was shipped over seas but it was well worth the wait. First of all there are so many diff sized of dotting that the possibility are endless. Totally worth the money, Ive used mine alot if not every time i do my own nails every week or so and they are in perfect condition. Deff recommend!</li>
    <li> i choose this rating because these dotting tools are awesome. I would recommend this product to anybody. love this product</li>
    <li> I got these earlier than expected. Unlike other reviews on here, they all came different sizes. One side of each of them is the same, the other different. Although i thought they would be different colors, but theyre all pink.</li>
    <li> not really sure why it&#x27;s needed I can get better dots with any other object. too sharp and always messing up the polish.</li>
    <li> The tips fall off when trying to use the item. I ended up having to super glue them in. It took awhile for my package to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying these again, nor will be buying from this seller.</li>
    <li> I havent used them but I tested them and can&#x27;t wait.  I love desiging my nails and these will definitly help me get better polka dots of different sizes.  They came earlier than expected too and are worth the price.  They will definitly get used a lot.</li>
    <li> The set arrived in great condition and was just what I needed. It works perfectly to create beautiful nail art.</li>
    <li> Comes in variety of sizes. The tip always comes out because of the bad glue. Hard to use when tip keeps falling off.</li>
    <li> I just use these for doing my nails at my home, so I don&#x27;t necessarily need ten different sized dotters. That being said, some of these are repeats of the same size.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected but they are pretty nice but kinda small</li>
    <li> These are so fun!  I didn&#x27;t even know something like this even existed, to be honest.  But as I became more and more addicted to Pinterest (who hasn&#x27;t!), I looked into different tools we could use for creating those beautiful manicures we see on there...but at home.  These are great.  We have had so much fun creating different designs with this pen set, and they are a great value.  Try them!</li>
    <li> I had no problems with this product. got it pretty quick, and it was in good shape. A++ I will use them again.</li>
    <li> gift for her nails to experiment and she loves them sh copiise nails that are done on pinterest and can with these</li>
    <li> easy to use, a great variety of sizes, pretty as well. Can do a lot with these. Am very happy with this order I would recommend and buy again if I lost them or for a gift. I must for someone who is into nail art! :)</li>
    <li> The dotting tools are made well and came in a nice clear plastic soft holder. Shipping took a little while but it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering 2 more for gifts.</li>
    <li> Great price! They are amazing! I usually try to make dots/round stamps with an orange stick, but these, are freaking amazing! There is virtually no POSSIBLE way you can mess up. There&#x27;s so many designs you can make with these too!</li>
    <li> i am very happy with this product. not only did it arrive fast, it is also good quality. couldn&#x27;t be happier with all the different sizes</li>
    <li> After making my own home made dotting tools I finally decided to buy real ones. These are cute and inexpensive. A must have</li>
    <li> I love the different sizes! There is so many sizes to fit any design and/or nail. Highly suggest for anyone looking for dotters.</li>
    <li> Arrived only 10 days after I placed the order. So fast considering it shipped from hong kong. Love the tools--really easy to make fun designs. And best part of course was the price!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and cute and works great! I like the variety of sizes you get and the fun colors. Nice addition to my nail art sets.</li>
    <li> Disapointed I didn&#x27;t receive exactly the same as pictured.  Its not the variety of colors.  It should be in description that you may not receive same as in picture.</li>
    <li> Need to learn how to use these things.</li>
    <li> the dotting tools are satisfactory and do the job they are meant to do, the only thing is that the tips on one side are all the same instead of having 10 different sizes you have only 5.</li>
    <li> this is very nice item and arrived on time,i really like it and i was really in need of this product because i like to try different nail art on my nails.</li>
    <li> This product came super quick and the nail dots are all different sizes, plus the design is super cute! I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Alright so I purchased this after a trip to the nail salon. I loved how the manicurist did it and figured why pay so much when I can do it myself. I have to say that the results were professional. Easy to use and everyone thought it was done at the salon. Absolutely recommend it. The item arrived immediately after purchase and in great condition.</li>
    <li> good product good price overall like it they should of offered black in the bundle its an important color too</li>
    <li> These work great. No complaints so far except some of the balls are pretty much the same size. Otherwise, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Arrived on the 10th day of the expected delivery days. They are so much smaller than I thought they would be! Not bad, it&#x27;s just I didn&#x27;t know what to expect! My friend and I were doing hair and makeup to get ready for a school dance and the package arrived so we decided to paint our nails! She did her toenails pink with tiny dots and I did my fingernails black with large white spots. Perfect dots every time. There aren&#x27;t actually 10 different ones, just 5. The ones on the other end are all the same size. Otherwise, super cute, buy buy buy!</li>
    <li> Perfect tools for dotting. These will take your manicures to the next level! Create perfect circle or dotted nail art desings</li>
    <li> I love these!  I use these all of the time and get a ton of compliments on the designs made from them!  Plus, they got here very fast and are great!</li>
    <li> They work as they should and clean up well. If quick, then just wipe off with a tissue. Rounded ends make nice even dots. Pretty too, with the twirled ribbon of color going through the stick.</li>
    <li> I love my new dotting tools!  I just would like a set of sable acrylic application brushes to match and they would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m crazy for this dotting tools. Polka dots are the easiest nail art ever but you need to buy this wonderful tools for it I love them. Would totally recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is a new tool for me to use on nails. It is a little awkward to dip and apply the polish. However with practice, it will become a fun way to add some pizzazz to a manicure.</li>
    <li> These were just as in the picture and arrived when they said they would! They are very sturdy as well.</li>
    <li> The package took about 2 weeks to arrive, but since it started in Hong Kong I feel like that&#x27;s a good time period. When I got them, they were all in really great condition. Theres different sized dotters on each stick and I&#x27;ve already used it twice. I highly recommend this product if you like to do designs with your nails. I love it.</li>
    <li> It took forever but this was worth waiting for!&lt;br /&gt;Everything was perfect and flawless.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to start doing my nails and making my nail tutorials with them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered on the 4th and received them on the 17th :(</li>
    <li> this is a great product for what you pay for i&#x27;m so happy with my purches!!!very cute i would recommend this</li>
    <li> When I got these dotting tools, on one side of ALL of them the size is the same. But on the other side of them, they are different sizes. I am ok with this because I only paid one dollar and some change for them, so of course I&#x27;m not expecting that much quality with these. Overall, I am ok with what I have. If you want something simple, I would recommend these, just know that there are only six sizes.</li>
    <li> I dont understand why my nail salon doesnt buy these instead of using orange sticks.  Theyre pretty, work well, and Im sure theyll hold up for awhile.  Cant best the price either.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price this tool is especially easy for first time people who want to start designing there own nails why pay expensive prices at beauty supply stores when you can buy it here!</li>
    <li> very affordable and fun!</li>
    <li> It shipped for free.  It was cheap. It works great. Easy to clean.  Arrived early.  Not broken.  It&#x27;s not rocket science.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  What more can I say.</li>
    <li> These nail dotting tools work wonderfully! They make great polka dots and can be used for many different designs. The colors are very fun and bright and they are exactly as pictured. I would for sure recommend these to anyone considering the price is so low and the product is great!</li>
    <li> These work great for nail art.  There is a variety of sizes, they do exactly what they are supposed to do.  I am very satisfied with product and price.</li>
    <li> It was great. They were a gift for my mom. She enjoys them. Although she won&#x27;t share with me lol</li>
    <li> These came just exactlya s described. They are in a little pouch so that&#x27;s a bonus and they&#x27;re quite attractive. Yes, one side is the same size for all of them and that size is also on the other end of one of them so the second side is really redundant. That&#x27;s ok, though. There are still 5 different stylus sizes and the price was outstanding.</li>
    <li> I know these are cheap and all, but the first time I used one, it snapped in two ... I&#x27;ll probably go back to using bobby pins for my dotting needs :-/</li>
    <li> I got these a lot quicker than expected. They&#x27;re super cute and seem pretty well-made. I haven&#x27;t yet, but I can&#x27;t wait to try them!</li>
    <li> Great product! I have been using these for over a year now and very satisfied. I wanted to wait to see how long they&#x27;ve lasted in terms of holding up together and the like. The tip hasn&#x27;t fallen out just yet so that&#x27;s a good sign! They work marvelously if you take good care of them and clean them after every use.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Good dotting tools liked them and my sister also loved them and they are easy to use. Recommend them if you like doing nail designs</li>
    <li> As in some of the reviews the sizes are duplicated unlike in the photo where you see all different but I do like them and got them for a great price.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 sets of these one for a girl I work with and one for me.  I love them.  Good quality, got them pretty quickly (being they came from China to the US).</li>
    <li> awesome little tool. works great for dotting . Not only for dotting  let your artistic imagination run wild and the possibilities are endless.</li>
    <li> good item...no issues</li>
</ol>
