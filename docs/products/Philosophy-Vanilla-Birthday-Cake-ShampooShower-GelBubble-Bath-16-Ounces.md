      <li>I love it!  </li>

      <li>I assumed she liked</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s nice sudsy soap.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for a friend after she smelled this on me - she was so surprised and very happy.</li>
      <li>I like the smell although it smells more like carmel with a hint of vanilla.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>One of my daughter&#x27;s favorite scents.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better scent since.</li>
      <li>But I thought it would smell better once using it, but it turned out to not make any difference.</li>
      <li>I lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair.  </li>
      <li>My family loves the many choices of smells</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love anything vanilla scented</li>
      <li>I think the smell is more of a mix of cocoa butter and vanilla.  </li>
      <li>has a nice sweet scent.</li>
      <li>AND TOLD ME HOW MUCH SHE LIKED THIS GIFT WHICH WAS NICE.</li>
      <li>However, the scent is nothing like a cupcake, more like a cheap vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>No matter the reviews bemoaning the scent, what could be more fun than giving Vanilla Birthday Cake as a birthday gift!</li>
      <li>I was super excited to purchase this because the reviews were so amazing on it, however I have experienced something totally different!</li>
      <li>I love these products...for what it is, I use it as a shower gel and the lather is great, doesn&#x27;t dry me out.  </li>
      <li>I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t have a very powerful scent.</li>
      <li>This stuff makes bathing fun!</li>
      <li>But I was excited for a Vanilla Cupcake sented experience...</li>
      <li>(I took off one star since this is full of chemicals).</li>
      <li>It is so sweet.  </li>
      <li>If you want a good Philosophy 3-in-1, get the \\&quot;Cinnamon Buns\\&quot;, \\&quot;Pumpkin Pie\\&quot;, \\&quot;Eggnog\\&quot;, \\&quot;Spiced Apple Cider\\&quot;, or \\&quot;Double Rich Hot Cocoa\\&quot; variations.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>Its addicting to use in the shower as bath gel and come out smelling so fresh.</li>
      <li>&quot; one right.  </li>
      <li>This right here was not.</li>
      <li>You literally smell like sweet cake batter, more like yellow cake than vanilla.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic and makes your skin so soft!!</li>
      <li>I love the smell of cocoa butter which is why I like this product, and I will keep using this product unless I find a more natural product that smells similar</li>
      <li>I know there are several reviews that say this stuff is wonderful, but I was not impressed at all, and I am being honest.</li>
      <li>I would strongly recommend no one buy this product...as many other reviewers said it smells nothing, absolutely nothing like a vanilla birthday cake, or any cake for that matter.  </li>
      <li>I am very likely not to try any more of their products.  </li>
      <li>My whole family loves the Vanilla Birthday Cake \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; by philosophy!  </li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was hoping this product would be.</li>
      <li>Smells good enough to eat--will buy again-makes terrific gift</li>
      <li>Pretty much smelled like soap with a dash of almond extract.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made with REAL vanilla beans and smells EXACTLY like vanilla cake mix.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase this bottle - I just received the free small bottle from Sephora.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Has a nice vanilla-y smell, but it is very short lasting.  </li>
      <li>It does have a wonderful lather, especially with a loofah, and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I have given to several of my friends, and it brings an immediate smile to their faces.</li>
      <li>I love philosophy,but this one has very little smell to it,which is one of the reasons I buy it.</li>
      <li>I would recommend the other products, the fruity ones, ice cream ones, Key Lime pie for sure..</li>
      <li>I expected it to smell so good, but when I opened it, I could barely small the &#x27;&#x27; vanilla birthday cake.&#x27;&#x27;</li>
      <li>but this one is my least favorite.</li>
      <li>I even wrote to complain and was told that they only return \\&quot;gently</li>
      <li>I gave this product three stars for lathering well and making my skin soft, but there&#x27;s no scent.</li>
      <li>However, I have nearly all of the Philosophy</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this does smell good and feels soft going on your skin.  </li>
      <li>This smells so good that I have a hard time using other shower gels now...</li>
      <li>Whereas \\&quot;Vanilla Ice Cream\\&quot; smells (strongly) like the plastic used in shower curtains, this one smells pretty much like the base used in all of Philosophy&#x27;s</li>

<li> The smell dosen&#x27;t last very long though.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t understand how their products can vary so widely in quality, but they do.</li>
<li> used\\&quot; products, what a rip-off (I want to use a more eloquent term, but rip-off is what it is).  </li>
<li> I certainly do not detect a bit of the \\&quot;Vanilla</li>
<li> Let me start by saying that the product works as well as Philosophy&#x27;s other products.  </li>

<li> I must say that I am not impressed with Philosophy&#x27;s new 3-in-1&#x27;s at this point.  </li>
<li> I can smell a slight hint of vanilla when I sniff from the bottle, but once I use it in the shower I smell NOTHING!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few years</li>
<li> Surprised anyone is disappointed in this at all!</li>
<li> Cant go wrong with Philosophy.</li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think you can ever go wrong with a Philosophy bath product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry, but this shower gel missed the mark.</li>
<li> I was not impressed and would never by that brand again.</li>
<li> Cupcake\\&quot; stinks and the \\&quot;Mimosa\\&quot; smells like Pina Colada to me.  </li>
<li> The one time I accidentally bought a 3-in-1 that didn&#x27;t have conditioner in it, my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m also crazy about Philosophy products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t nearly as great as I hoped. Pretty much smelled like soap with a dash of almond extract. Try L&#x27;Occitane almond shower oil instead! It was exactly what I was hoping this product would be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase this bottle - I just received the free small bottle from Sephora. I just wanted to warn people that this does not smell like vanilla or birthday cake to me at all. It almost smells like cigarette smoke or plastic.</li>
    <li> This review is for the vanilla birthday cake scent.&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with the other reviewers who say this does not smell like vanilla.  I think the smell is more of a mix of cocoa butter and vanilla.  I love the smell of cocoa butter which is why I like this product, and I will keep using this product unless I find a more natural product that smells similar (I took off one star since this is full of chemicals).</li>
    <li> No matter the reviews bemoaning the scent, what could be more fun than giving Vanilla Birthday Cake as a birthday gift! I have given to several of my friends, and it brings an immediate smile to their faces. And the price is reasonable enough to keep a few on hand for all the birthday girls in your circle of friends. I don&#x27;t think you can ever go wrong with a Philosophy bath product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells just like vanilla CAKE.  I&#x27;ve read all the reviews stating that it doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla.  I think it smells just like vanilla cake.  I love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff. If you wash your hair with it you will smell like a Krispy Kreme store. Yummy!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend after she smelled this on me - she was so surprised and very happy.</li>
    <li> I love anything vanilla scented and I&#x27;m also crazy about Philosophy products. I&#x27;m sorry, but this shower gel missed the mark. I can smell a slight hint of vanilla when I sniff from the bottle, but once I use it in the shower I smell NOTHING! I gave this product three stars for lathering well and making my skin soft, but there&#x27;s no scent. I wish Philosophy would sell the Eggnog all year. Now that&#x27;s a scent that you can smell!</li>
    <li> Has a nice vanilla-y smell, but it is very short lasting.  It does have a wonderful lather, especially with a loofah, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re disappointed because this product doesn&#x27;t smell like a vanilla cupcake, try Perlier Vanilla Cream Bath.  It&#x27;s made with REAL vanilla beans and smells EXACTLY like vanilla cake mix.</li>
    <li> I would strongly recommend no one buy this product...as many other reviewers said it smells nothing, absolutely nothing like a vanilla birthday cake, or any cake for that matter.  I am very likely not to try any more of their products.  There is only 1 3-1 that I would recommend, the Double Dutch Chocolate (I think that&#x27;s the name, it is sold here at the Amazon site.  I even wrote to complain and was told that they only return \\&quot;gently used\\&quot; products, what a rip-off (I want to use a more eloquent term, but rip-off is what it is).  If I could rate this at less than one star I would.</li>
    <li> Delicious scent, great bath product. One of my daughter&#x27;s favorite scents. I like it because it&#x27;s not overpowering yet has a nice sweet scent. It is a great birthday or holiday gift</li>
    <li> You can use as a shampoo (you dont need conditioner) or body wash.</li>
    <li> I was so intrigued by being able to shower and come out smelling like a cupcake, but was disappointed.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this does smell good and feels soft going on your skin.  However, the scent is nothing like a cupcake, more like a cheap vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend trying another scent or buy a cheaper vanilla if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sephora is great as always with prompt shipping and nice packaging.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that the product works as well as Philosophy&#x27;s other products.  However, I have nearly all of the Philosophy 3-in-1&#x27;s and I keep hoping that they will get a \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot; one right.  This \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; is even worse than their \\&quot;Vanilla Ice Cream\\&quot; in the sense that it barely has a fragrance at all.  Whereas \\&quot;Vanilla Ice Cream\\&quot; smells (strongly) like the plastic used in shower curtains, this one smells pretty much like the base used in all of Philosophy&#x27;s 3-in-1&#x27;s.  I certainly do not detect a bit of the \\&quot;Vanilla Cupcake\\&quot; fragrance they claim the product should have.  What I do detect as a slight fragrance vanishes immediately after the product leaves the bottle.  I must say that I am not impressed with Philosophy&#x27;s new 3-in-1&#x27;s at this point.  The \\&quot;Vanilla Cupcake\\&quot; stinks and the \\&quot;Mimosa\\&quot; smells like Pina Colada to me.  If you want a good Philosophy 3-in-1, get the \\&quot;Cinnamon Buns\\&quot;, \\&quot;Pumpkin Pie\\&quot;, \\&quot;Eggnog\\&quot;, \\&quot;Spiced Apple Cider\\&quot;, or \\&quot;Double Rich Hot Cocoa\\&quot; variations.  And always remember that if you use these products as a shampoo, you will need to use a good conditioner afterwards.</li>
    <li> I use the Philosophy 3-in-1 WITH CONDITIONER.  It works great and keeps my hair luscious.  The one time I accidentally bought a 3-in-1 that didn&#x27;t have conditioner in it, my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends.  After only three applications I had to throw the bottle out.  I lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair.  I don&#x27;t understand how their products can vary so widely in quality, but they do.</li>
    <li> I like the smell although it smells more like carmel with a hint of vanilla. Also, it washes my hair really good without leaving residue. The smell dosen&#x27;t last very long though. But, I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My whole family loves the Vanilla Birthday Cake \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; by philosophy!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> GAVE AS A GIFT TO A TEENAGER AND SHE CALLED AND TOLD ME HOW MUCH SHE LIKED THIS GIFT WHICH WAS NICE.</li>
    <li> This Vanilla Birthday Cake multi- purpose product is wonderful. It smells just like cake and everyone that I come in contact with always compliments me.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a surprise gift for someone a while ago and they loved it. If you know someone or you yourself are into the Philosophy products then this is a good choice. Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I love these products...for what it is, I use it as a shower gel and the lather is great, doesn&#x27;t dry me out.  But I was excited for a Vanilla Cupcake sented experience... I was dissapointed.  I would recommend the other products, the fruity ones, ice cream ones, Key Lime pie for sure..I would not buy this again for the smell.</li>
    <li> This smells a lot more like cake than vanilla, but I like it!  It is so sweet.  The smell sorta goes away after the shower, but I can smell it even with an unopened bottle sitting in the shower.  If you can get some of Philosophy&#x27;s chocolate frosting 3-in-1, you could wash once with this and once with that - and you&#x27;d be washing with a piece of cake!!!  I love it!  I use this exclusively as a shampoo (I like my soap for bathing), and it is very good.  I also use an additional conditioner, though, but I don&#x27;t see this as a drawback.  This stuff makes bathing fun!</li>
    <li> This smells so good that I have a hard time using other shower gels now...this might be my favorite smelling and feeling of all time!</li>
    <li> This is the best body wash I have ever used. I started using this back in 2006. I haven&#x27;t found a better scent since. You literally smell like sweet cake batter, more like yellow cake than vanilla. It is truly amazing.</li>
    <li> My family loves the many choices of smells Philosophy has. And it&#x27;s nice sudsy soap.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t have a very powerful scent.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is not as great as I hoped.</li>
    <li> Smells good enough to eat--will buy again-makes terrific gift</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product it smells like dawn dish soap it dries the skin out something terrible</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift item for my mother. I assumed she liked it didnt hear elsewise. Cant go wrong with Philosophy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few years and I love it!! It smells fantastic and makes your skin so soft!! So thankful I found it for this price! Hope they never run out of it!!! Would highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Love this all-in-one!</li>
    <li> I adore this scent. It&#x27;s so lovely!!! Its addicting to use in the shower as bath gel and come out smelling so fresh. Surprised anyone is disappointed in this at all!</li>
    <li> I love philosophy,but this one has very little smell to it,which is one of the reasons I buy it. Sorry but this one is my least favorite.</li>
    <li> It is a good quality shampoo that nourishes my colored hair.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to purchase this because the reviews were so amazing on it, however I have experienced something totally different! I expected it to smell so good, but when I opened it, I could barely small the &#x27;&#x27; vanilla birthday cake.&#x27;&#x27; But I thought it would smell better once using it, but it turned out to not make any difference. One perk was that the soap itself was thicker and did lather up well, but once I got of the shower, the smell had already faded away as if I hadn&#x27;t even washed with it. I was not impressed and would never by that brand again. I would suggest Warm Vanilla Sugar from Bath &amp; Body Works if you want something worth your money. This right here was not. Maybe my bottle just was the bad one out of bunch, and I know there are several reviews that say this stuff is wonderful, but I was not impressed at all, and I am being honest.</li>
