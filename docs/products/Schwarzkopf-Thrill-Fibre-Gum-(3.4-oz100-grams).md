      <li>This is a great product for short hair.  </li>
      <li>Helps you &amp;#34;sculpt&amp;#34; you hair into place with a light hold.  </li>
      <li>The product is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Love it, exactly what I was expecting from this product.</li>
      <li>Using more will not add more hold, only more shine.</li>
      <li>OSIS Thrill smells almost exactly like that factory, and it&#x27;s just as overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I like the mild control it gives me with my hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and controls my fly aways.</li>
      <li>I have a short funky cut, and I love this product!</li>
      <li>I have straight fine hair.</li>
      <li>right out of the box</li>
      <li>The picture shown is not the exact product that is shipped through amazon&#x27;s fulfillment from ASAPbeauty.  </li>
      <li>...so expect this to last for more than a year</li>
      <li>fast service!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products similar to Schwarzkopf Thrill</li>
      <li>Too much work to get the right texture.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell and just the right consistency to hold the style you want, without leaving your hair feeling sticky or hard.</li>
      <li>Schwarzkopf Thrill fibre gum is perfect to use to slick back the sides of long hair to calm down hair fly aways when you need create a ponytail or updo.</li>
      <li>Most people wouldn&#x27;t, but its a strange world.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great for my very short hair, keeping it in place without stickiness or residue, and giving it a little heft that I want.  </li>
      <li>Works very well lets you spike your hair like you want</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I smelled like a cheap candle until I washed my hair over 24 hours later.  </li>
      <li>Better than what I expected even.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE --- I am really liking this product now that I have used it a bit.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t capable of noticing any improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll have to experiment to find how much you need.</li>
      <li>I have very think, kinky hair.</li>
      <li>Nice hold, not hard and crispy or too heavy in your hair.  </li>
      <li>I use a smidge of this gel/cream styling pommade, warmed between my hands, and then apply it throughout my short hair for a soft-sculpted, super shiny look for my silver hair.</li>
      <li>I love how it can essentially replace a spray wax, or possibly even a hair spray.  </li>
      <li>Only thing your hands will get really sticky but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>The amount needed is less than the size of a dime for each application ( I do have thin hair and significant hair loss on top so others might need more).</li>
      <li>Or maybe it killed off so many brain cells</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of other OSIS products</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a dude with fine hair in a high and tight cut, and when I put this in my hair, it looks like Cameron Diaz from &amp;#34;Something about Mary&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how the people who worked there dealt with the strong, perfumy smell because just driving past the factory on certain days</li>
      <li>First let me say this can is tiny.</li>
      <li>It has been over 5 yrs since I bought the small tin and just now getting more.</li>
      <li>This product provides a strong hold for your hair without making it stiff or leaving any residue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s versatile in that, I can style my hair while wet for a glossy finish; or I can let my hair dry then use the product for a more natural look.</li>
      <li>It is quite hard to make it look polished and elegant without putting a lot of product.</li>
      <li>I have short hair and it really stays in place.</li>
      <li>It is never gooey or greasy and looks totally natural.</li>
      <li>I wear it in a spike and this make it stand up naturally</li>
      <li>This product works in the same way as it used to (quite well), but the smell changed, and now it&#x27;s much girlier.</li>
      <li>But so far no luck on styling products.</li>
      <li>and it is soft.</li>
      <li>What I usually do is style my hair with warm water when I get up in the morning, then dry it off.</li>
      <li>Be careful not to use too much though</li>
      <li>Very affordable compared to other products.</li>
      <li>I had tried every high end product and spent thousands over the years.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best I have found for body and styleability.  Love it.  WW</li>
    <li> Without my Schwarzkopf I am a lost man. I spread roughly a pea size amount evenly throughout my hair at night after shampooing. When I wake up its style and go without grease or excessive shine. Even when you apply on a wet head in the am and go it spreads evenly and doesnt leave a part of hair looking different than the portion without the product. I buy three at a time to reduce the % of total paid on shipping.</li>
    <li> The picture shown is not the exact product that is shipped through amazon&#x27;s fulfillment from ASAPbeauty.  See pictures I uploaded that indicates that this is the European version of the OSIS+ thrill 3 product (multiple language label, made in italy, AL can designation, measured only in ml and different ingredients/formulation).  This product seems to have slightly less hold, and has a slightly different fragrance than what you buy in the salon here in the USA.  If you do not mind slightly less hold for less money, then go for it!  It is not the same product though. I gave this item 3 stars because it is misleading.  I have no real problems with the product, but I will probably stick to the salon-purchased version after I finish this can because I need more hair control.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has been in my arsenal for the past 2+ years.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and controls my fly aways.</li>
    <li> Best smelling Hairgel ever!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for short hair.  It textures well, keeps \\&quot;flyaways\\&quot; in order and works great for texturing.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product. It styles your hair in any way you want it. It is also non-greasy. I love the scent too.</li>
    <li> This product works in the same way as it used to (quite well), but the smell changed, and now it&#x27;s much girlier.</li>
    <li> I have long hair to the middle of my back but the top is sometimes lank and will not, can not&lt;br /&gt;do what I always want it to do...I got OSIS THRILL today and right out of the box it did what I have wished&lt;br /&gt;for and it smells wonderful and stays soft....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to reorder more and had to post a recommendation....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+10 and I am hard to please.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M</li>
    <li> I discovered this product from a hairdresser years ago and have been using it ever since. I love that it is not greasy and you don&#x27;t need but a little bit to style hair. Very affordable compared to other products.</li>
    <li> I ordered what was pictured.  Instead I received a product with the same name but different quality product that.  What turned me off most and why I returned it was the change in scent.</li>
    <li> I was big fan of Schwarzkopf for a few years now but I haven&#x27;t used it for a while. I decided to buy this one cause it was priced a few bucks cheaper than what I remembered. Anyway, the stuff is not what I remembered. It now comes in light red color, smells different, and worst of all, has a very weak hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have unruly hair that needs a strong-hold product to keep in place, this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product over the past several years. It was the best. I had tried every high end product and spent thousands over the years. Then my salon discontinued it. They even wished they still sold it! I tried to buy it from supply houses and was told it was from Canada and couldn&#x27;t get it unless I got it through a salon. What a wonderful surprise to find it on line. It is so good at keeping away the frizzees. It also comes back to life the next day with just a bit of water. It is never gooey or greasy and looks totally natural. I paid twice the price at the salon than is offered on line.</li>
    <li> This puts the finishing touches on the styling of my hair.  A little goes a long way and give my gray hair body and a lot of shine.</li>
    <li> First let me say this can is tiny. I mean maybe 3&amp;#34; tall. Second, let me say, its gum. Would you put gum in your hair? Most people wouldn&#x27;t, but its a strange world. I&#x27;m a dude with fine hair in a high and tight cut, and when I put this in my hair, it looks like Cameron Diaz from &amp;#34;Something about Mary&amp;#34; if you know what I mean. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using OSiS for over a year, and I haven&#x27;t found anything better. This product provides a strong hold for your hair without making it stiff or leaving any residue. I can touch my hair throughout the day, and it will stay for 12+ hours. The jar seems small, but all I need is a bit (probably around the size of a quarter) to style my hair. It&#x27;s versatile in that, I can style my hair while wet for a glossy finish; or I can let my hair dry then use the product for a more natural look.</li>
    <li> Have used for many years! Love this product! I am so glad I found it on Amazon! I have straight fine hair. I have a short funky cut, and I love this product! I can twist,twirl mess up.....and this does the job! A little goes a long way! Washes out and leaves no scalp residue! That&#x27;s a plus in my book.</li>
    <li> 5/5 Stars!! Was perfect! Better than what I expected even. Will buy again someday!</li>
    <li> This product works wonderful on short hair for styling.  A little goes a long way.  The price is far less than what I was paying in the salon.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I got this product here for less than my stylist pays for it. It holds my thin hair in place yet still has a lite feel and look to it. The amount needed is less than the size of a dime for each application ( I do have thin hair and significant hair loss on top so others might need more).</li>
    <li> Cheapest price anywhere and in my opinion the best fiber out there. Only thing your hands will get really sticky but it&#x27;s worth it. Great stuff</li>
    <li> This is a good product to give your hair style, while still looking natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hold is subtle, so you&#x27;ll need to style your hair before you use it. What I usually do is style my hair with warm water when I get up in the morning, then dry it off. This allows your hair to find its place before you rub in the fibre gum. You can use this product with slightly damp hair, but dry hair is ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need very little of this product to style your hair. Using more will not add more hold, only more shine. I use less than a dime for my hair, which is usually one inch long. You&#x27;ll have to experiment to find how much you need. For this product, less is always better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3.4 oz size lasts over a year and a half for me.</li>
    <li> I read some mixed reviews, so I decided to go forward with the purchase.  Well, it definitely isn&#x27;t the same as the one my hair stylist uses, which was disappointing.  The jury is still out as to whether I will repurchase or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE --- I am really liking this product now that I have used it a bit.  Definitely I&#x27;m changing my start rating to a 4.5. I love how it can essentially replace a spray wax, or possibly even a hair spray.  I definitely like the idea of minimizing any aerosal fumes at every chance I can.  This is a GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I always buy this product and was very disappointed with this purchase! The package is different than what is advertised and the product doesn&#x27;t hold at all. I bought 2 to get the free shipping, so I now have 2 useless containers! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have responded three times to this. I love the product and will continue to purchase it. thank you again</li>
    <li> Was great and just the product my hair stylist had been drooling me before she quit carrying the brand.  Happy,happy,happy to have the two I ordered!!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a recommendation from my sister, and after I started to use it my daughter started &#x27;borrowing&#x27; it from me!  Nice hold, not hard and crispy or too heavy in your hair.  We all have different hair types, from thin to coarse to thick and wavy, and it works well for all of us.</li>
    <li> The product is great. However, when ordered through Amazon, I considered the $10 shipping charges on an $11 item to be totally unreasonable and unacceptable! I will not be using Amazon to order this product again.</li>
    <li> reorder this product often as we use it daily. great product.</li>
    <li> great product.... not at all all greasy and all you have to use is a drop...so expect this to last for more than a year</li>
    <li> I used to drive past a candle factory to and from work.  I don&#x27;t know how the people who worked there dealt with the strong, perfumy smell because just driving past the factory on certain days gave me a headache.  OSIS Thrill smells almost exactly like that factory, and it&#x27;s just as overwhelming.  The only time I used it, I wondered if it would weigh my hair down, so I tried a VERY SMALL amount.  I smelled like a cheap candle until I washed my hair over 24 hours later.  I didn&#x27;t see any styling benefits, but I assume it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t use enough.  Or maybe the smell blinded me to the styling power of the product.  Or maybe it killed off so many brain cells I wasn&#x27;t capable of noticing any improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of other OSIS products ([[ASIN:B001CN5S4C Schwarzkopf Osis Dust It 10 gm]] comes to mind), so I&#x27;ll stick with them.  This one was donated to a deserving friend.  I hope she forgives me.</li>
    <li> Works very well lets you spike your hair like you want brings life to your hair great product</li>
    <li> This made my hair gummy. Schwarzkopf has an extensive line of styling products and I think I&#x27;ve tried just about all of them because I&#x27;ve always had luck with their hair products. But so far no luck on styling products.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It works well on my short hair.  I can style my hair to do what I want it to do when using this fibre gum.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000BW5XQI OSIS Thrill Fibre Gum 3.4 oz]] I use a smidge of this gel/cream styling pommade, warmed between my hands, and then apply it throughout my short hair for a soft-sculpted, super shiny look for my silver hair. Use more product for a more punked-out look.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant fragrance and this little jar lasts for months of daily use.</li>
    <li> Just beware - if you have dyed dark hair it WILL strip the color out - I use(d) it for my front fly away hairs and its ORANGE now. My hair was dyed two weeks ago and now needs to be redone.</li>
    <li> my wife has been using this product for many years. it was actually recommended to her by a hair stylist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products similar to Schwarzkopf Thrill but I ALWAYS go back to it!  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff and a little goes a long way!!!  Won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Great service, wonderful product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Ideal product for fine hair.  Holds well without giving the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34;.  Best product I have found for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Schwarzkopf Thrill fibre gum is perfect to use to slick back the sides of long hair to calm down hair fly aways when you need create a ponytail or updo. Can use on wet or dry hair, just takes a small bit.</li>
    <li> Love it, exactly what I was expecting from this product. Not heavy and sticky, works awesome. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have very think, kinky hair. It is quite hard to make it look polished and elegant without putting a lot of product. This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I can now manage my hair without it looking greasy and heavy.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this.  The product is fantastic.  Helps you &amp;#34;sculpt&amp;#34; you hair into place with a light hold.  Be careful not to use too much though or you&#x27;ll have a greasy look.</li>
    <li> fast service! Found this to be cheaper than buying it from hairdressers. use it daily. I like the mild control it gives me with my hair.</li>
    <li> I used this for a couple of weeks and ended up giving it to a friend.  Too much work to get the right texture.</li>
    <li> This product works great to do a spike.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  been using it for years and it&#x27;s great for my very short hair, keeping it in place without stickiness or residue, and giving it a little heft that I want.  it&#x27;s a terrific product.  my hairdresser uses it, which is how I came to know of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff while in Russia and use it often. It has been over 5 yrs since I bought the small tin and just now getting more. It has a pleasant smell and just the right consistency to hold the style you want, without leaving your hair feeling sticky or hard. Hopefully this product will remain available!</li>
    <li> My go to product for hair--gives you that messy/control factor, yet brushes out when you need to. Washes out well to. Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this!!</li>
    <li> A super product, ideal for fine hair, thanks.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I used some over the holidays that belonged to my sister. Even though this was described exactly like her&#x27;s, the consistency is too thick and sticky. Would return it if I could.</li>
    <li> Use this item every day! I have short hair and it really stays in place. It, also, was recommended by my hair dresser.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff in my hair.  I wear it in a spike and this make it stand up naturally and it is soft.</li>
