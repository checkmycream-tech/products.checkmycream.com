      <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
      <li>I give amazon 5 stars for customer service they took care of it and threw in the shampoo for free thanks amazon and in a way thanks guy who misled me</li>
      <li>Great product, worth the $, last a long time</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is probably the best shampoo I have ever tried. I typically blow dry my hair every day to keep it frizz free, but since I began using the Moroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner I haven&#x27;t had to blow dry my hair and I am loving it. My hair is naturally wavy and thin, and I have not had any frizz and my hair feels amazing. I thought the Moroccan oil in the shampoo and conditioner would weigh my hair down and make it thinner, but it doesn&#x27;t. I love, love it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I absolutely love about this line is the smell. The smell is amazing. My son is 3 years old and for the first time, he told me the other day that my hair smelt nice :) I was pleasantly surprised. I love that I can smell the shampoo and conditioner even after my hair dries. Some shampoos and conditioners smells great in the shower, but after your hair dries, you can&#x27;t smell the lovely scent. With the Moroccan line, you can smell it all day long, even into the next day :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love it. I am going to buy the huge 32oz size pretty soon :)</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a really good shampoo for awhile, now.  It shouldn&#x27;t be so hard. I want clean hair without dryness; I want shine without greasiness; and I want to retain the color that I&#x27;ve spent a fair bit of money upon.  Since I have been using Argan oil for my skin and have become a big fan, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try for my hair, as well.  The result is that I think I&#x27;ve found the shampoo I&#x27;ve been looking for: it&#x27;s gentle, safe for colored or treated hair, and moisturizes without weighing down the hair. Other reviewers have mentioned the fragrance -- it is distinctive but pleasant. Take note, though, if you&#x27;re sensitive to perfumes -- it does tend to linger.</li>
    <li> Love it. The smell is heavenly.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best shampoo I have ever used.  My hair is softer and shinier which is a great accmplishment for older hair (over 50).</li>
    <li> a nice size bottle at a great price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon. Great product for over treated hair. I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it and it easily tangles....with this shampoo and Moroccan oil conditioner plus the actual Moroccan oil....no more tangles!! My hair feels incredibly soft yet styles well and isn&#x27;t at all flat.  I ran out and bought some bumble and bumble coconut shampoo and I was back to tangles.  I won&#x27;t stray again!  I reco the Wet Brush as well to make a tangle free experience.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very,very drying and the pump on it was broken!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you buy this from the original maker to know if you&#x27;re&lt;br /&gt;really getting the real product!! Don&#x27;t buy from this place because&lt;br /&gt;they will not work with you on a refund!!!!!</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil Moisture Repair Shampoo 16 oz. didn&#x27;t come with the pump as advertised. It had a pump top without the actual pump. I have to unscrew the top and pour the product into my hand and rescrew the cap each time.</li>
    <li> I was mis-lead by this product purchase, when I ordered the product it showed a shampoo and conditioner, when I received the box it was a only 1 large shampoo. I was expecting a shampoo and conditioner (1 of each). I love the shampoo and conditioner together but now I have to purchase a conditioner to go with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this product, make a my hair look great!</li>
    <li> I was wondering why my MOROCCAN OIL products were not giving my hair the same results as before , REASON :&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS NOT MOROCCAN OIL the shampoo and conditioner are FAKE , I purchased the same MORROCANOIL products from salon HUGE difference ! Do YOURSELF A FAVOR and compare I did from reading a previous posting !&lt;br /&gt;EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED ! SHAME ON YOUR COMPANY !</li>
    <li> Great product for my dry, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The woman that cuts my hair reccomended it and it was a really good call. Doesn&#x27;t take much, so it last a good bit longer than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. Makes my hair feel thicker and smoother. Will continue using it.</li>
    <li> its false your only gonna get 1 shampoo! the picture is misleading you should take it down asap. I thought it was the combo pack. I give amazon 5 stars for customer service they took care of it and threw in the shampoo for free thanks amazon and in a way thanks guy who misled me</li>
    <li> The image of this product shows a bottle of conditioner and a bottle of shampoo. Naturally, that leads one to believe that this is a 2-in-1 product. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Yes, the heading says shampoo only, but then why show a photo of a product that is not delivered? This is clearly an example of false advertising.</li>
    <li> Great product, size, and delivery time I am very happy about my order.</li>
    <li> I have tried many shampoos over the years and I must say this is one of the best.  I have dry, brittle and over-processed hair.  This shampoo works so well that it leaves my hair feeling very clean and shiny. I don&#x27;t have any split ends.</li>
    <li> If you have hard water, this product is for you and it smells great too! Don&#x27;t let the price deter you....it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love Moroccan oil but as my title states it&#x27;s not 16 oz, but 16.9!  I use an APO type address and the limit is 16 oz!  I bought this SPECIFICALLY because it was 16oz then I find out that is incorrect.  DESCRIPTION IS NOT CORRECT!  IT WAS REJECTED.  SO ANNOYING!  The smaller size is over 8 oz so I have to buy shampoo and conditioner separate, I thought this would be better since I would be getting a larger size.</li>
    <li> The product came with a broken spout making it very difficult to use. Therefore I am not happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to my mom. She loved it. I hadn&#x27;t used this, but my mother liked so is ok</li>
    <li> Not as good as products purchased from MO website.</li>
    <li> Be careful - the picture shows both the shampoo and the conditioner - beware this is only the shampoo it Does NOT include the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love the Morrocan Oil products!  My hair is in the best condition ever.</li>
    <li> I am African American and my hair is natural. Not the afro natural but more like a Jerry curl natural. I used the shampoo in my hair and it made it poofy. I used my same conditioner and heat protectant but when I began to style my hair it was just really puffy. It could be that the products didn&#x27;t mix well together, but I doubt it. The product is to expensive to buy the set and see if works better with the same brand of product.</li>
    <li> I rated this at a 2 because when I bought the shampoo there was a pic for a set of both shampoo and conditioner and I paid thinking that&#x27;s what I was buying but I was fooled and just got the shampoo... NOW ON TO THE ACTUL SHAMPOO.... It&#x27;s amazing the best thing ever it is the real thing so idk what the person before me is talking about .. Shipping was not bad came in about  week or so.. But again I wish that I was compensated for my misfortune..</li>
    <li> Pricey but the results are worth it. My hair color does not fade as fast. Especially because I color my hair often.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo have been using it for some time and I have curly hair so I love the smell and the way it controls my curls</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting both shampoo and conditioner.  That&#x27;s what they show in the picture so be aware it&#x27;s only shampoo.</li>
    <li> I do love the normal Moroccan shampoo.  This was not it.  Also the pump was broken.  I had to pump it over 7 times to get enough shampoo out and sometimes I had to do more.  It was hard work!</li>
    <li> The top of the shampo was broken, when I receid it. To much hassle to return it by post.&lt;br /&gt;Regards A. Nyback</li>
    <li> Everything great as always.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for my curly hair and I feel like it smooths my hair out so nicely. .Finding great products for curly hair is difficult. ..I really love this product. .</li>
    <li> Be careful - the picture shows both the shampoo and the conditioner - beware this is only the shampoo it Does NOT include the co</li>
    <li> Great product, worth the $, last a long time</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this shampoo on my hair, and I love how soft and smooth it is. I&#x27;m over 50 and my hair is longish and it is color treated, so I need shampoo that will treat it gently.  This stuff works great!  I highly recommend it - along with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hair just look amazing using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> A Poor quality shampoo with a false label - a cheap, fake version of the original MoroccanOil Shampoo (which I like very much). I bought the conditioner and shampoo - and am very disgusted at being deceived - and paying a high price for an inferior product. Buyer Beware!</li>
    <li> i have wavy and damaged hair. So I expected this shampoo to be good for me but it turn out to be like regular shampoo. With that price range I could buy any two regular shampoos which will do the same job. May be good be fine hair type.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair looks and smells!! It makes your hair very silky and shiny--always get a lot of compliments</li>
    <li> Been a huge fan and love the product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not my fav shampoo. For the price I expected my hair to feel softer, shinier, healthier, but it didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but I&#x27;ve been told by many salon owners to only by hair products directly from the salon.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, it makes my hair looks more healthy and silky, also very maneageable.  I would really recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo on the market. My hair stylest said my hair has never looked healthier. Highly Recommend, Best Product EVER!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair nice and shiny and smells good. I don&#x27;t use it every day as that would be too heavy for my hair, but use it about twice a week. Good product</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product if your hair has a tendency to lack moisture. I looked at the sample kits in the salon for weeks wondering if it could work for me. I was introduced to this product last year as a complete gift set from my Dominican hairdresser in the Washington Heights area of Manhattan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a woman of color, the texture of our hair has a tendency to be dry, course and always in need of moisture to remain healthy looking. As I learned years ago, lack of moisture often leads to dryness and a brittle texture which results in split ends and breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first because I always used another product line for years and it worked well for me. I never knew that there was something else out there. After the first treatment using the Moroccan Oil shampoo, conditioner and hydrating mask I immediately saw a change in the texture of my hair. I have been using this product line for over a year now and will not use anything else. I am living proof that African American women can have long luxurious naturally healthy hair that shines and has bounce. Don&#x27;t let the word \\&quot;oil\\&quot; discourage you because you think it will weigh your hair down. It does not. The Moroccan Oil product line is the best way to go. Give it a try and see the results. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting both products for this price and all i got was the shampoo, which I would not have purchased for this price.  I think they should only be able to show exactly what you will get so people do not make the mistake I did, but I am all the wiser now....they will not fool me again with this tactic.</li>
    <li> Its totally a fake and the products info even written by Tai language!!!!</li>
    <li> Product as advertised.</li>
