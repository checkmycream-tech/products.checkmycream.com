<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought as a replacement for my dads razor.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I recently got a hole in the foil of my shaver. Since it is about 3 1/2 years old, I got the combo pack with the new blades, Now my shaver works much better. Love it!</li>
    <li> This combo restored my shaver to new condition.  What a great way to get a new shave, and cost effective too.</li>
    <li> Always hate to purchase replacement parts for any brand razor but the Panasonic razor and replacement parts make it feel like a new razor. Can&#x27;t say that for other brands.</li>
    <li> There is not too much to say about this product.   The Panasonic Arc IV series razors are the best in my experience.   They give a closer shave than other electric razors, and they are easy to clean because they are fully immersible.  However, it is important to replace the foil on about a yearly basis.    With repeated use, the razor gradually gets louder and seems to cut just a little less effectively.  The changes are easy to miss because they occur gradually.  Installation of this blade and foil brings it back to the very quiet performance and close cutting of the new item.   While most of the advantage is probably gained by replacing the foil only, I opted for this combo offer.</li>
    <li> This OEM foil/blade replacement cut my skin in 5 places. It&#x27;s a bit sharper that the 1 year old original foil/blade that came on my shaver, but not as sharp or smooth as the original was when new. I&#x27;ve heard that shaver companies sell their reject blades as &#x27;replacement&#x27; accessories as a way to recoup losses, and my experience seems to support that theory.   Anyway, considering the expense and bleeding, I opted to return it and replace the entire shaver, which isn&#x27;t that much more expensive when you get free shipping on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a tough one to review, mostly because they&#x27;re not as good as the originals that came with the razor. That&#x27;s not to say they suck by any means, not at all. But, I don&#x27;t feel like the razors are as sharp - the cut isn&#x27;t as close. I&#x27;ve heard there are a lot of reasons for this, some say Panasoic uses imperfect blades as replacements, which seems difficult to believe but whatever. Either way, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s AS close as the original that comes with the razor.    With that said though, it&#x27;s still pretty close, even if you have to spend a bit more time shaving. You don&#x27;t really have much option for replacements, it&#x27;s not as if there are other blades and foils you could use, so, if you&#x27;re gonna buy it - no better place than Amazon.    Also, be warned, do not press hard onto your face when using your razor and foil. Not only does it prevent a closer cut and wear out your foil, it also can make the blade nick the foil and put a small gash into it. I&#x27;ve done it twice and I&#x27;m usually very gentle.</li>
    <li> Bought these replacement blades for my husband for Christmas.  Excellent product his razor is like new.</li>
    <li> I do replace the foil on my shaver (ES8249) annually, and following the suggested maintenance, needed to replace the blades as well after two years. This combo replacement pack was reasonably priced and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the replacement process was. Razor working like new again and the skin on my face is happy about it!</li>
    <li> Replaced original foil and blade with new panasonic replacement set for my es8243 panasonic shaver after one year. Shaves closer and faster. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought these as replacements and they are not as good as the original blades that came on the razor.</li>
    <li> Panasonic shavers have very thin foil for closer shave (I guess!).  As a result foil is very fragile.  But it works very well, and changing the foil and blades was no brainer!!</li>
    <li> Perfect Replacements at a great price.</li>
    <li> Dull when I received.  Very disappointing for almost $50.00.  The original blades lasted more than a year but I&#x27;ve gone through three sets of replacements, all dull.  Mostly use a blade again.</li>
    <li> Its exactly what I ordered at a good price.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well (close shaves, but takes a while), but the major problem at least in my case is that the foil and blades do not last long at all. I have found that I have to replace them within 2-3 months of dry shaving. Beyond this time frame, I have a difficult time shaving and I start to get cuts on my face. This is unacceptable in my opinion especially when one considers the expense involved to replace the blades and foil. By the way, I like to have real close shaves and even when the foil and blades are brand new, it takes me a lot longer than 3-5 minutes (more like 20 minutes)to shave to my satisfaction. I have never tried wet shaving and perhaps that is the problem. I plan on trying it with a shaving gel in the very near future and perhaps I can then provide a more satisfactory review.</li>
    <li> Snapped right in and razor is good as new.  Not much more you could ask for a replacement head and blades.</li>
    <li> The packing is a pain to open, did  not open easily, I had to use garden shears. Poor packing design. The product is fine, no problems.  2 stars deducted because the product could be damaged if not carefully opened.</li>
    <li> This replacement foil and blade set was sharp for about a week and then declined rapidly. My last time buying a Panasonic foil shaver.</li>
    <li> Wrong blades in replacement pack. Foil was correct part number on pack was right, but blades where wrong!</li>
    <li> Cuts smooth and required to replace periodically. Comfortable and easy to replace.</li>
    <li> Panasonic products are high quality, precision manufactured items.  I&#x27;ve been using these shavers for years, and I&#x27;m impressed with their durability.  Generally, I&#x27;m able to utilize a foil / cutting block combination set for six months prior to replacement.  I usually begin noticing a degradation in shaving quality just a few weeks before Amazon sends my next automatic six month replacement.  I&#x27;ve owned Braun shavers, as well as additional brands.  While Panasonics are not as popular in the States, I would not choose another razor.</li>
    <li> Purchased a Panasonic Shaver about a year and a half ago and it is the first time I am replacing the blades.  My Panasonic shaver is shaving like new again!  Best shaver I have ever had!  and I suspect I can get another year out of these blades.</li>
    <li> Verry good product fantastic  product super top classe quality end no expansive price top top panasonic razor combo shaver foil</li>
    <li> My husband has had this razor for a several years and loves it. (for his work he has to shave daily). I  just purchased this replacement kit for him, it was just time.</li>
    <li> very overpriced but needed for a good shave in the shower. some of us older guys need moist steam to get narly hairs to stand up. only lasts a few months but razors cause irritations.</li>
    <li> Makes my razor like new</li>
    <li> Fit my husband&#x27;s panasonic Razor, he is thrilled with it.  We will be looking for a replacement some time in the future.</li>
    <li> I found that the price was standard no matter where you attempted to buy it.  There was no discount.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the parts fit with no problem.  However, I found the original foil and blade to be&lt;br /&gt;much sharper, giving a better shave.</li>
    <li> The reason I choose this item is because I am very satisfied with the original Panasonic shaver.I have used this shaver for the last 10 years and will continue. Thanks</li>
    <li> The Panasonic shaver is great.  This replacement made it as good as new.</li>
    <li> What can I say. I needed new blades and foil, so I ordered these. They only took two days to arrive. everything worked like it was suppose to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Panasonic ES8249B for over 6 years now. In that time I believe I have purchased 3 of these replacement kits. Panasonic recommends you replace these items every 6 months but I average 3 times that before replacement. Now I only dry shave with it and rinse under running water at least every other use so your replacement time may vary but this has worked out well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dread the day my ES8249 battery wears out. Once that day comes hopefully it can be repaired and continue on as I have absolutely no complaints with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Good quality with good price.</li>
    <li> Keeps my old shaver working like new.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old blades were. Getting fresh new blades makes a huge difference. If you have a Panasonic razor that uses this type of head and you&#x27;ve had it more than a year, do yourself a favor and get new blades!</li>
    <li> Very good if you are shaving daily but it is not good for long beard.</li>
    <li> Have had my razor for lots of years and always buy these replacement parts.</li>
    <li> Very simple: if you own a Panasonic razor that uses this blade/foil kit, it will return the razor to like-new performance. Painless installation: snap in the blades, clip on the new head with new foil, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> This replacement works as advertised and I should change mine more often than I do ordinarily. I&#x27;ve never taken advantage of the regularly scheduled distribution.</li>
    <li> The original foil developed a hole in it after less than 2 years. While this was a bit pricey for the set, it certainly made for a better shave (and no biting!).</li>
    <li> After about 40 days, the outer foil developed a small hole, which nicked my neck. I can&#x27;t believe this replacement foil failed after such a short time when my last replacement lasted an entire year. Buyer beware. Unfortunately I love the shaver and will try to buy just the outer foil. I certainly don&#x27;t have a rough beard.</li>
    <li> Great replacement.  Much better shave.</li>
    <li> The only reason I rated this item a 4 star is because of the price and I know it&#x27;s not because of the item. I just feel like a lot of things are overpriced nowadays. That&#x27;s probably the reason so many people elect not to shave anymore&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s an excellent product and being the Panasonic shaver is well made I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had this razor (ES 8249K) for 4 years - no problems even with shaving in the shower every day. Th razor is always getting soaked - Panasonic&#x27;s engineering with this has been first rate imo.  Last month the shaves were not as smooth so I begrudgingly bought the replacement foil and blades combo for $50 - expensive - but has transformed the razor back to like new condition. The shave is faster and closer as compared to the older foil and blades. I did price out a new razor and always want the latest technology, but the price of the 5 blade arc models are too high, so imo this is the best deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I have posted this before but if you are  fan of wet shaving, def try Proraso&#x27;s tube shave cream [[ASIN:B00837ZOI0 Proraso Shaving Eucalyptus Menthol Formulation]] - menthol or sandalwood. Spread  a little on your face and keep it wet, the razor glides over your face while iINCREASING the lather. Absolutely the best for this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vito</li>
    <li> These blades work perfect on my Panasonic ES8243A.  Replaced my original blades after a year and notice a HUGE difference in cutting ability.</li>
    <li> The blades and foil were easy to replace and the razor is as good as the day I bought it.</li>
    <li> Replacement head easily installed, good quality, works fine, but is expensive.</li>
    <li> I buy these at least 2-3 times a year.  I didn&#x27;t know that they would need replacing so often.  It gets expensive!!!</li>
    <li> This product brought my razor back into a comfortable shave. I went 4 years without replacing these parts. Dumb mistake.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this set 3-4 times before and all have worked properly except this one.  The cutting bars on the Shaver Foil cover were not making proper contact with the moving blades.  The blades slipped inside the cover sounding like a nest of angry hornets!!  I looked at the cutting bars with the razor on and saw that they were not moving.  Very disappointed and a damn shame that I need to toss out my 5 year old razor, but I won&#x27;t miss paying over $50 every 6-7 months!  I though electrics were cheaper and gave a more comfortable shave than blades but, after reading the high praise for this safety razor [[ASIN:B003987CL0 Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, 1-count Package]] , I&#x27;m going back to manual shaving!!! Giving it one star because I can&#x27;t give it zero!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my razor.  Nice packaging, easy to install.  Price a bit high. Great shave.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Very expensive but in the long run, cheaper than razor blade. Definitely  need to replace these every 6 months for a smooth shave without the razor burn. Works great with replacement. I recently started to use soap lather and find that it works so much better than regular shave cream because the soap lather brushes on so much closer to the skin.</li>
    <li> Decided to try this before buying a new razor, and I&#x27;m glad I did. Like new. A little pricey, but much cheaper than a new expensive razor.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly and works great.</li>
    <li> Fits my Arc IV Nano perfectly.  10 second installation.&lt;br /&gt;I knew my blades were worn after a year, but didn&#x27;t realize just how much until now.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement set gave me a minute faster shave, and a better cut as well.&lt;br /&gt;If you feel like you&#x27;re not getting the performance you used to, this is the answer.</li>
    <li> New life to beloved razor.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you want to save some money and repair rather than replace.</li>
    <li> This is clearly the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It provides, with a new blade, a one-pass clean and close shave.  No going over areas and bearing down to get it to shave off all those whiskers.  Once the blade becomes dull, you need to replace it about once per year of daily shaving.  Recharges quickly, charge will last about a week and then you need to recharge.  Easily portable to travel with, lightweight.  I&#x27;ve owned Remingtons and Norelcos before, but this one is my new razor for life!</li>
    <li> These replacement blades are expensive, but the work. I find the quality to be about like the original blades.</li>
    <li> I will replace again in 1 year rather than waiting 4 years.  My shaver works like it did when new.</li>
    <li> What a difference! I knew that was supposed to replace the blades and foil on a regular basis, but had never gotten around to it. I replaced my originals with the pieces from this set, and WHAT A DIFFERENCE! I went from feeling like I had to plow through my beard to shaving with no effort at all. The razor runs more quietly, and I get an incredibly close and smooth shave now. It&#x27;s like I had forgotten how good this my razor could be.</li>
    <li> Gives a better shave provided you haven&#x27;t  changed in over a year .  Way to expensive. Costing half the price of a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Not much to say - does exactly as it should do, considering it is a Panasonic replacement part for a Panasonic shaver!</li>
    <li> My Panasonic razor was not getting the job done.  With the new blades and foil, it is working again.  I didn&#x27;t love spending so much, but I was able to make the original set last for several years.  These seem the same and might last too.  That would make the cost per year $25 or less, and that isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> Authentic Panasonic product made in Japan</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now had my Panasonic shaver for a year with excellent results. Decided to replace the foil/blades as recommended. Good price, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I brought open case item, but it looked like new. Now I replaced package to use the product. It really good for me.</li>
    <li> Quality as original one, never thought I need to change my old foil and blades, what a difference , glad I bought it !</li>
    <li> Works great and is very quiet.</li>
    <li> I love my Panasonic razor. This is the third (or fourth?) set I have purchased. Every time I need a new set, I start looking at new electric razors. Then, I come to my senses and buy another blade/foil set and wonder how I could have even thought about buying another razor.</li>
    <li> The blades and foil are great and make my panasonic electric razor like new again. The Nano arc iv is the best electric out there, braun pulsonic (which I own) doesn&#x27;t come close to the shave you get from the panasonic. I have owned every brand and keep coming back to the panasonic, plus you can shave in the shower with your favorite foam.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on hyped products like the pulsonic or norelco. Even the lower end panasonic models in the $99 range are better than the $300 pulsonic. Don&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t warned!</li>
    <li> This was purchased to replace a long used head unit.  However, the new item was not very sharp at all and did not seem to cut through my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow well.  It gets 2 stars for continuing to work, but it is certainly NOT as sharp as new.</li>
    <li> Good replacement and easy to use. Came quickly and I assembled it in less than a minute. Good product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Fit like a glove on the old shaver. Hubby is not cutting his face any more with the broken screen.</li>
    <li> I shave my head and face using the Panasonic Vortex razor. First time I have replaced blades and foil in 18 months. New replacements are like having a brand new razor. Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Nice new item, no issues with replacement, now my shaver works same as new. I love my Panasonic shaver and highly reccomending it.</li>
    <li> While about half the cost of the entire original razor, they are in my opinion worth it. They have brought the razor back to like new performance. It was taking about 3 minutes to get an adequate shave. With the replacements it takes about a minute and a half for a better closer shave.</li>
    <li> It does do a good job but it is a little expensive. But we like this shaver so we needed to get this!</li>
    <li> Good quality replacements. Worked as the originals.</li>
    <li> This must be a fake Panasonic product.  The replacement blade after a few shaves is not as sharp as the one year old blade I threw away.  I&#x27;ll have to buy a new shaver but it won&#x27;t be Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I was concerned when my shavers light came on (saying I needed a new cutter head) after only 5 months of use. I own the 8249S panasonic.  So I bought the complete cutter and foil assembly on the subscribe plan.  This did a very good job restoring the shaver to better than new. I guess I must of been pressing too hard when shaving. Maybe that sort of wore down the old one.  I was disappointed that the original did not last very long.  Happy camper now though!!</li>
    <li> replacement blade was good, however the prices panasonic is charging retail is a ripoff. the blade cost 1/2 the price of a new razor. Panasonic is giving the razors away and ripping us off.. Just like computer printers.. cheap machines,  expensive black ink...... cost more than gas for a car for colored water.&lt;br /&gt;oh thats the game and life</li>
    <li> This is the second set of replacements I have bought. This means I was satisfied the first time. The foil and blades fit perfectly and do the job well.</li>
    <li> Replacement foil and blade set has made a big difference to the quality of my shaving. The fact the Panasonic ES8243A shaver has a warning icon on the led display is also very helpful to assist  in knowing when to replace these parts. The order was &#x27;lost in transit&#x27; for a little while but Amazon went to great lengths to make sure all went well.</li>
    <li> This was a total waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;It maybe improved my shaving by a factor of 10%, yes 10% which is negligible!&lt;br /&gt;If your unit doesn&#x27;t shave well, save more and just buy a whole new unit.&lt;br /&gt;I think at the factory the calibration for the head unit is measured very very accurately by lasers so when you replace the head unit, you eff up that precise measurement and you barely see a difference&lt;br /&gt;At least that was my experience</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He says it&#x27;s like a brand new razor.  He returned the new one I bought him for Christmas.  The old razor just needed these new heads.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item with the thought that it would fit the shaver model ES-LA63. (If you have this model you will understand as it seems to be a bit of an oddball in the panasonic shaver lineup) Unfortunately it will not fit. The opposite side of the silver plastic housing rather than being rectangular has a five sided angled opening where the trimmer would be. Also the entire housing is several millimeters narrower that the LA63. The correct set for the ES-LA63 should be WES9025PC. Interestingly Panasonic&#x27;s own support site does not seem to know about this replacment set. Hopefully this will help someone else avoid making the same mistake I made. In regards to the product I recieved, I can say that it is a genuine Panasonic product that says it is stainless steel and Made in Japan. This is encouraging after reading some comments questioning the quality of the product. I had to arbitrarily rate the item so kindly disregard that. I never opened the package seeing as I could not use it.</li>
    <li> I waited far too long to replace the shaver foil and blades, so I was stunned at the difference the new set made. I had gradually gotten accustomed to shaving being mildly uncomfortable and even a little painful, and finally realized my blades had gotten dull. The change with these new ones was stunning. Painless, effortless gliding over the skin allowed me to cut my shaving time in half. Am making a reminder to myself to replace every ten to twelve months.</li>
    <li> This blade will Not fit the ES8243A razor.  Neither will the WES9068PC, which did fit when I last bought it.  Did Panasonic redesign the razor and leave those of us with older models stuck with a paperweight?  OR maybe the overrated Japanese manufacturing excellence is a myth and their products are 3rd world quality.  Amazon has replaced and finally refunded 3 orders in the past ten days and as done so without hesitation.  Bravo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to Braun</li>
    <li> Best move I have ever made. I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old blades were. I strongly suggest replacing the screen along with the blades for maximum performance.</li>
    <li> Good as new, original packaging, prompt delivery. Not sure why these have to be quite so expensive, but it is like having a new shaver again for about half the price, and its one less gadget in the landfill. I&#x27;d unquestionably buy from Panasonic over Amazon again.</li>
    <li> The blades fit the razon but not the cover.&lt;br /&gt;Too much trouble to try to get the correct part now.</li>
    <li> my beard is not ripped out anymore.  hooray for sharp new blades</li>
    <li> Great shaver and replacement blades last a decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> I bought a new Panasonic shaver (Panasonic ES8249K Arc IV Nano Vortex Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaving System, Black) in february 2009, and in may it had already developped a hole in the foil, which rendered it unusable. It is my belief that i treated the shaver and the foil \\&quot;by the book\\&quot; and that the foil is extremely fragile (is it the price to pay for a very thin foil ?) I nevertheless had to buy these replacement parts but they cost me close to half the price I paid for the new system, so bear in mind that the Panasonic shaving system is very good, but that it will cost you a lot to maintain it in top notch operating conditions.</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price. Information was accurate. Thanks, John</li>
    <li> Took 10 seconds to install. Old blades just snap out and new blades just snap in. Now works just great.</li>
    <li> Let me say that I love my Panasonic ES8243 shaver.  This foil is overall a good product and it produces a close shave with the ES8243 shaver. For whatever reason, my original foil wore out and was breaking down after 7 months. It is supposed to last one year. I had to purchase a replacement foil 7 months after getting the shaver.  The replacement foil however has lasted for 14 months now with no sign of breaking down.  I have had good results with the cutter head which has been durable and maintained sharpness  The price is painful; for the cost of 2 replacement combos, you could almost buy a new shaver.  5 stars for quality, minus 1 star for expense.</li>
    <li> The cover did not fit-- wrong model</li>
    <li> 10 second replacement.  Great to have a close shave for my husband again.  This was a reasonable price combined with free shipping.</li>
    <li> I forgot how much I love this razor. With the new blade and screen it&#x27;s like new.&lt;br /&gt;Product was delivered quicker than expected. Very satisfied!!!!</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly and in good shape.  The shaver now shaves like a brand new one.  Thank you for making this available.</li>
    <li> This set absolutely restored the quick, close shaves I got from my Panasonic when it was new. (Much faster and closer than the Braun shavers that came before it) After a few weeks however, the sharp edges on the blade unit seem to be getting dull.  Makes me wonder if they have switched to some softer steel for them.?.  More time will tell.</li>
    <li> Fits Panasonic shaver perfectly.  Restored like new shaving feel.  Wish I had changed them out sooner.  Identical to original equipment.  Great product.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I switched to Panasonic due to the poor quality of another manufacturers replacement blades. These blades are sharp and reliable. This is my second set and I recommend Panasonic razors to anyone that uses electric razors.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly for the Panasonic electric shaver.  The shaver works as good as it did when it was new.  Also changed out the blades.</li>
    <li> All is fine, quickly and efficiently. Thank you. if so always have all worked! And so was rushed and all very very good.</li>
    <li> The parts work, and restore function to the razor, but I cant but feel abused by the price they charge.&lt;br /&gt;This was an expensive razor when purchased new, there is no way the pricing on these parts from Panasonic is anything but gouging.  All shaving products are priced to gouging levels for consummables, and it ticks me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this review pertains to pricing, not performance.  Which is of high importance to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boo Panasonic, and all other shaving product manufacturers.  I feel ripped off, and because of this crazy pricing, I am switching to double edge safety razors.  The handle I pay for, and blades can be as cheap a nickle.  I dont feel nearly as ripped off, and as a bonus your get a better shave.</li>
    <li> Panasonic makes the best shavers, bar none......it now works like it did when it was brand new.....not sure why it cost so much but I don&#x27;t mind paying for quality</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a replacement blade assembly. What can I say. It works.</li>
    <li> had it before and it is great</li>
    <li> I have ordered this blade set twice from this retailer. Reasonably priced, good shipping time and easy to use. Excellent.</li>
    <li> The shaver does a nice job, but the blade assembly needs occasional replacement.  Replacement parts do the job, but are just a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> If your razor is taking longer than 3 min to trim your beard then you need this. Makes the razor like new again. No pull or drag. Mine was taking forever to cut and the old foil was getting hot. Totally worth the money to have a close, clean shave every time!</li>
    <li> very well I use ES8243A</li>
    <li> The razor head and blades are great. They work very well. The one complaint that I have is that they get dull too fast. They are noticably duller within a month. At around $50 in two months you could buy a brand new razor for the price of two sets of heads and blades. They can still be used when dull it justs takes more time and passes.</li>
    <li> This shaver has proven to be one of the best I have owned.  Replacement foil and blade set every six months keeps it as good as new!!</li>
    <li> I think next time I will just get a new razor.  This item works fine but costs way too much.</li>
    <li> This kit contains the two shaving blades and the foil shield.  Easy to swap out, I could hear the shaver run at a higher RPM afterwards.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but for some reason, FedEx left the package with US post office to deliver instead of at my door...I ended up getting the delivery about a week later.</li>
    <li> Average results. Got it on a special discount so that is happy news. Like the shaver and needed to change the parts. 3 Stars.</li>
    <li> Great product, now my razor is just like a new one.  The replacement blades are a little expensive, but for now I think its worth the cost and they are a genuine Panasonic product.  I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> Blades were good. The foil didn&#x27;t fit the shaver. :( I have ordered this product before with no problems. However, this time a different foil set was sent out.</li>
    <li> These last me about a year and a half, maybe two years. I shave every day with the same electric razor, but I don&#x27;t have much to shave off. It always stinks to bite the bullet on replacing your blades, but I&#x27;ve trusted Panasonic for the past 10 years and they haven&#x27;t let me down yet.</li>
    <li> Just what was needed, exactly.</li>
    <li> New blades and foil for the daily razor, works like new again.</li>
    <li> Positively like a new razor. What a difference it makes after having replaced this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my shaver for over two years and this is the first replacement foil and blades. I expected a fairly significant increase in both closeness and comfort, but got neither. The foil feels scratchy to my face and, if anything, I have to spend more time to get a close shave. Not at all impressed.</li>
    <li> Nice replacement. These are expensive but work like a charm.</li>
    <li> The blades seem to not last very long. Have to go over your face many times to get a clean shave. It seems to take longer each time. This is not the fault of the seller but rather Panasonic the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> If you are reading this you&#x27;ve already got the exceptional Panasonic Arc4 and want to get it working like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased two of these sets in the last 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one in early 2012 had sharp blades, but the outer foil quality was off - it both nicked my skin at times, and left hairs too long at others.  I swapped the original foil back on with the new blades and it worked sufficiently well.  Amazon is great with returns, I honestly didn&#x27;t feel like dealing with it once I got a workable solution, though I was disappointed that I basically spent $50 on new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I shave every couple of days and pre-shave with a beard trimmer so they lasted longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second set, purchased last week, was night and day to the first replacement.  The razor feels brand new again, and I&#x27;ve cut 45-60 seconds off my shave time according to the timer on the razor - it usually takes ~3 minutes and I&#x27;ve been managing 2-2:15, occasionally under 2!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newer set provides the same incredibly close shave that lasts all day that I&#x27;ve come to expect, only way faster and with virtually no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refuse to buy an entire new razor when mine is still fully functional.  Even if some of these sets are partially bad you could by two of these for the cost of a new razor, environmental impact of trashing a perfectly good razor notwithstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you compare the cost of one $50 replacement kit every 9-18 months (depending on shaving frequency) vs the cost of disposables, it&#x27;s really not that bad.  I hope my arc4 holds up for years to come.</li>
    <li> Works fine, good price</li>
    <li> Work as expected and still shaving with it.</li>
    <li> Works well. Easy to replace old blades and foil.</li>
    <li> No choice, only replacement cutter for the shaver. If you choose to use electric, the parts are expensive. This shaver is one of the best I have owned and recommend it for the quality.</li>
    <li> Not sure about five stars, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, but I do use the shaver daily.  The new blades seems to get closer than the old ones they replaced. They were easy to install.  Time will tell if they hold up.</li>
    <li> Prices for replacement parts for shavers seem to be consistently going up and up.  At times, it could be cheaper to just purchase a new shaver.  However, these parts are of high quality given the price.</li>
    <li> FITS PERFECT...WORKS PERFECT</li>
    <li> This product is what it claims to be.  I have been using it on my Panasonic Wet/Dry since purchase and have had no problems.  It was shipped promptly and is as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with my Panasonic shaver since day one. It gives me a close, smooth shave with little effort and minimal skin irritation, performing better in both regards than the Norelco models I&#x27;ve used for years previously. It&#x27;s also far easier to clean and maintain.    I purchased this replacement foil and blades set not out of necessity -- the originals that came with the shaver weren&#x27;t worn out yet -- but to save myself the hassle of having a day come where the foil DID eventually wear out and I&#x27;d be without a shaver until I could get a replacement. I&#x27;m happy to say that changing out the blades couldn&#x27;t be simpler (just pop off the old ones and pop on the new), and the replacement foil comes as part of a complete new plastic head \\&quot;shell\\&quot; assembly, the same one you routinely remove and replace while cleaning the shaver, so it&#x27;s no problem to replace, either.    I do notice some improvement in shaving performance since replacing the originals with this kit -- not that the shaves I was getting had degraded badly at all, but I can tell the difference that brand-new blades make. Since the originals are still perfectly usable, I&#x27;ve put them away in the packaging from the replacement kit for safekeeping, as an \\&quot;emergency backup\\&quot; just in case I do something to damage the new ones.</li>
    <li> Panasonic WES9020PC Combo Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set (Purchased on 02/08/2011) - the foil was fine, but the blades were dull &amp; worse than those replaced - very suspect!  In the future, I will use the Panasonic store for replacement.</li>
    <li> Great original replacement for my razor. Works perfectly! Just like new again after I replaced these. Had no issue with product.</li>
    <li> My Panasonic 8249 razor provided an alert on the LCD that the foil needed changing.  Certainly the foil screen was separating.  I&#x27;ve replaced the blades 2 times before now the combo pack brings the razor back to like new performance.</li>
    <li> Too Expensive, but no competition!</li>
    <li> Excellent service from Amazon and excellent product! Now my two year old panasonic shaver is working like the first day!</li>
    <li> Nothing more to say.  It&#x27;s a replacement foil and blade.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned and the replacement foil and cutter always work brilliantly.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and parts were simple enough to replace.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to restore my Panasonic razor to like new operation.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, lasts long time.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for both foil &amp; blades. I&#x27;ve had terrible luck with Panasonic replacement batteries, the ones I&#x27;ve received were total junk. So I was VERY nervous having to order any type of Panasonic replacement item, but this worked out so well I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another right now just to have it on hand.</li>
    <li> Good replacement.  As advertised.</li>
    <li> Great replacement blades.  Work as good as the original.</li>
    <li> You can make your razor like brand new with these replacement blades.  They also cost much less than buying them locally and you have the option of a further discount by using Subscribe &amp; Save.  I think this is the perfect combination; quality, efficient and affordable.</li>
    <li> This foil set caused some damage to my face, unlike the original foil set that came with the shaver. There were spots of abrasion that caused bleeding and never healed due to daily shaving. Either this foil set was defective or it was counterfeit. Tossed it and bought a new one from a local factory authorized retailer for a bit more money. No further issues.</li>
    <li> Made my shaver like brand new. Really easy to install and worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Thanks for continuing to carry this item for my old razor, makes it like new!</li>
    <li> The replacment foil and blades were origional equiptment and made my shaver perform like new. I perhaps avoided replacement longer than I should have so the first shave with the new parts was great.</li>
    <li> Works perfect now. Replaced 3 year old foil and blades. Now my razor works much better. Should have done this a while back.</li>
    <li> I like my Panasonic razor, but it had stopped shaving as closely as I wanted. I purchased this replacement set, and my razor is like new. Just make sure it is the proper replacement kit for your razor. If it is, you&#x27;ll be happy. I wish I had bought this sooner!</li>
    <li> So the last time I bought this set was June 2012. In between I purchased just the blades. Basically I got 9 months on the original set that came with the shaver. 11 months on the next blade/foil combo. 10 months on just the blades.  The shaver has been adequate but certainly not like when it was new. I think these replacement sets are not quite as good as the ones that came with the original shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically at nearly $50 a copy x 2,almost equals the cost of a new shaver every other year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like I either have tough hair, and sensitive skin, or these shavers just aren&#x27;t made like they used to make them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the shaver is still available new, and basically the same price I paid in Jan 2012. That may be my next choice rather than blades or foil, or I&#x27;ll switch to another shaver that doesn&#x27;t have blades that add up to the cost of the shaver in 2.5 years.</li>
    <li> Had my Panasonic razor for 5 years now best ive ever had.</li>
    <li> It works makes Razor like new again</li>
    <li> Excellent seller and product , fast shipping, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Quick shipment. The last set lasted approximately two years and rather than buying just the cutters I prefer to change both the head and cutters at the same time.</li>
    <li> This is my third set of new blades with foil and my shaver just keeps on getting the job done.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of a shave is like night and day when old worn blades are replaced with new ones.</li>
    <li> expensive, but works great</li>
    <li> Nice refresh to my razor...like new again!</li>
    <li> The replacement for my Panasonic electric shaver came sooner than expected. The packaging kept the part from any damage that might occur. When I need another one I will use this means of replacement. Amazon did their job.</li>
    <li> 1st set I received (May 2011) was poor, 2/5 stars.  Didn&#x27;t cut nearly as well as the blades that came with my ES8243A.  The foil started rusting after a week.  2nd set I received (Nov 2011) was very good, 4/5 stars.  Pretty close in performance to the original blades.  NOTE: Both times, I purchased directly from Amazon and not a 3rd party seller.  Seems like Panasonic has a quality control issue with these blades.  Which are you going to receive, a good set or a bad set?  No way to tell.  Since these are fairly expensive, it can be a costly gamble ... but the Arc IV is so good (and so much better than Panasonic&#x27;s 3 blade electrics) that you just have to order it and hope for the best.</li>
    <li> These are replacement parts that work perfectly well with my Panasonic shaver, which I&#x27;m still happy with.  Not cheap, but cheaper than buying another shaver of comparable quality.</li>
    <li> good price, shaver works like new.</li>
    <li> These blades may be a bit spendy, but in my case they turned an unusable shaver into a just like new one. I had a Panasonic shaver that I had pretty much worn the blades down because my beard is tough as nails. One of the hardest things to do was to make sure that the blades I was ordering were the right ones for my shaver. It turned out that they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, they slipped in to the shaver with no problem and the horrible sound that the worn blades were making was completely gone with these new blades in place. In order to cut down on some of the friction and maybe make these blades last a bit longer than the year that the other blades lasted, I now use a small coating of shaving cream on my face when I shave which helps the razor slide over the beard much easier and cuts the friction down by quite a bit. That should have the dual bonus of giving me a much more enjoyable shave as well as help blades to wear down less quickly. That is why I love this wet/dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have heard it over and over but I will repeat that putting a new foil and blades set into a good shaver like the Panasonic will make it like a virtually new shaver and improve the shave tremendously. These replacement items have saved me from having to buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> the replacement told me I really needed to replace the old head and blades.  Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Quality replacement parts for a reliable and durable Panasonic electric razor.</li>
    <li> Moved on from years of Braun.I was tired of dry shaves. There is no better system out there hands down. Some day l might need this replacement but in the meantime shaving in the wet just like a blade makes the sharpness last seamingly forever.</li>
    <li> Their easy to change and well put together ...but the shaver has a high pitched sound that is hard to listen to that close to your ears and is definately made for those that have a light weight beard. If you let your beard go fo anything longer than 3 days this combo fails miserably. The shaver cannot be used while plugged in [ a real negative ]. I&#x27;ve had it quit [run out of power] while shaving which leaves the shaver stuck to your beard and hurts like hell to pull off you face. The charge does last a long time but the shaver also takes a very, very, very, very, very long time to get the job done. It usually takes 15 minues or more to shave with it, think I&#x27;m done, only to feel my face and to have to continue longer. A 15 minute plus shave is the norm. and the plus being a key word.  It easily bogs down on a heavier beard by just skipping heavy parts. The power cord is a real pain in the patuttie to plug into the bottom of the shaver. The Braun line seems to do much better overall [i wish i had gone that route again] live and learn and let others know through reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my shaver for number of years and guess you get use to the reduction of cutting over time, but after I put these on boy was that shaver working like it was bran spanking new again!</li>
    <li> A perfect OEM replacement that makes the razor feel like new. I knocked a star off only because the price feels a touch steep.</li>
    <li> Helps to continue to provide a great shave.  At a reasonable price.  This shaver provides a good close shave and extends its life.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard so didn&#x27;t think I needed to follow the guidelines for blade replacement.  However, I went ahead and bought this and realized that the old one hadn&#x27;t been cutting as close.  What a difference!  It was easy to install, probably took less than 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> This was for my friend.  He never replaced the whole shaver foil like this one before, so it was much easier to replace.  He really likes that, but not the price!</li>
    <li> It was great until my new puppy got to the razor and destroyed it. I will not be purchasing this item again. Thanks Miss Lucy</li>
    <li> The price is a little high but brings back the closeness in my Panasonic ES8249.  It says to replace yearly but I seem to get the notification to replace it much sooner than a year.  I have replaced the foil and blades 4 or 5 times in 3 years and its still working good.</li>
    <li> I bought my shaver 3 years ago and it was one of the best things I did!&lt;br /&gt;Now, after this time, I replaced the blades and for sure will have more 3 years to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money invested</li>
    <li> Replacing the heads of my shaver gave it new life.  As they advertise, the heads should be replaced annually.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It makes the razor new again.  Better shaves and quieter (for some reason).  I have had the razor 4 or 5 years and this my 2nd replacement.  The 1st replacement was blades only.  2nd replacement was blades and screen.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement part. No problems at all using it.</li>
    <li> The old head was getting old and I saw the symbol on the Shaver to change the head, so I replaced it and wow what a difference in the volume of noise and it cuts great again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over a year since I originally purchased my Panasonic razor from an Amazon Deal of the Day. As with most electric razors, the blade quality degrades slowly over time so its easy to keep going with a dull blade and forget that you need to replace it. Decided that it was finally time and ordered the replacement foil &amp; blade set for my ES8249S model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades were quick to pop out and replace with the new set. The foil and plastic housing snapped right into place. I immediately gave it a test shave and what a surprise to have fresh blades. You tend to forget how hard you&#x27;re pushing the razor against your skin until you have brand new blades and the difference is noticeable. After shaving, skin felt smooth and the shave was much closer than from my old blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an easy purchase. Its recommended to replace blades every year, but I think I may have to do so sooner just because the shave quality is vast improved with new replacements.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Panasonic electric razor for over a year now and it was time to change the foil and blades although I did not think I was getting a bad shave, just thought one year was about the right time. What a surprise, I got a much better shave once I installed the new foil and blades. I love this razor. So set an automatic popup on your calendar to order a new foil and blades every 12 months.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but like having a brand new shaver! One of the best shavers I have ever bought and the replacement blades make it even better. I bought the shaver about 2 years ago and finally decided to get replacement blades. Just like new!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this replacement because it was cheaper than any I could find locally. I will purchase again, the replacement was just as good as the original.</li>
    <li> Bought it to replace the blades on my Panasonic arc electric razor and it did just that. It&#x27;s working like a brand new razor again. In general the product seems expensive but when you compare it to buying blades for a manual you definitely save money in the long run.</li>
    <li> These make your shaver feel like new again. They are somewhat expensive here and everywhere else.</li>
    <li> This set of foil and blades makes your shaver like new! It is made in Japan and has a great quality.</li>
    <li> completely compatible with my system. comes in a nice sealed container. new ones simply snap into place could not be easier.</li>
    <li> As expected, they say to replace every year (I recall) which is a little pricy. But considering the options not so bad. My original blade last ed 18 month and then went down hill fast. Nice to have a clean soft save again. In another 18 month I&#x27;ll probably just buy a whole new shaver. Which Im sure is there business model. Maybe I should switch to a straight edge.</li>
    <li> This replacement restored the quality of my shave.  I will keep replacing the foil and blades until the razor battery gives out.</li>
    <li> ...and that&#x27;s pretty important, since this is the only source for it. There&#x27;s no a whole lot of choice with this.</li>
    <li> After trying several electric shavers over the years this one is the best.  A close shave and no irritation for a very sensitive face.  After more than a year of use I used this package to replace the foil and blades.  After an extremely easy installation, pop the old blades off and the new ones on, my favorite shaver is like new again.  So why only 4 stars?  The price of a simple foil and 2 little blade inserts was quite pricy.  I just think almost half the cost of a brand new, foil, blades, motor, battery, charger, carrying case, and all is a little steep.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid for these blades and foil, could I have simply purchased an entirely new razor? Of course, but not THIS razor. Until the motor dies, I will continue to purchasing this set to maintain the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had out of an electric razor.</li>
    <li> Worked as a perfect replacement, identical to the orignal on my razor. They make several models, check the manufacturers website to make sure you get the right ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At around $50, or about half the cost of the new razor, I found these blades to be very expensive. And I did not replace my originals for 3 years because they seemed to be doing ok. I know the manufacturer recommends every year or something like that....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 years, I decided a new set would probably cut better and faster, so I bought these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice the new blades seemed &amp;#34;sharper&amp;#34; on the first few shaves. But the did not save much time at all. I let my beard grow for 3 days while on vacation, then received the blades and did test. I shaved one side of my face with the orignal (3 year old blades) and the other side with the brand new blades. It took 1:15 to shave (half) with the old blades, and 1:08 to shave the other half with the brand new blades - in both cases shaving until I got &amp;#34;the closest shave&amp;#34; possible with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using these for a few weeks, I think they are now pretty much identical to the originals in how they cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion - I didn&#x27;t really need these and could have kept going with the originals and saved $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have damage to your originals or they are just not cutting well, these will do a fine job. The product is an exact match (assuming you get the right one for your model razor) and does what it is supposed to. I gave it 4 stars because it is very expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my ES8243A</li>
    <li> Great blade replacement.  Beats buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> The only replacement to use.</li>
    <li> My old foil had holes in it that caught my hair, and the blades were dull. Overall, this was a quick, and easy to install fix for my Razor.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric shaver and I have had it for several years now. I love it. The replacement heads go on easily and work great. I replace the pair every year and find I never feel there is a problem with the razor&#x27;s shaving.</li>
    <li> Nice - works great. Smooth shave.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly and a great fit for the product, I couldn&#x27;t be happier as this is hard to find on the shelf</li>
    <li> Not the quality of performance as the original which was disappointing. Also, at this price the consumer should expect a consistent performance. Poor quality replacements, don&#x27;t throw your originals away, they may perform better that these expensive replacements!</li>
    <li> It is working good in my skin</li>
    <li> The product arrived in good condition and works well. Amazing the difference a new set of blades makes. Shaving time reduced, therefore more shaves per battery charge.</li>
    <li> I had never replaced my original blades and after nearly two years of constant use replacement was desperately needed. After placing the order the blades arrived quickly and the simple replacement made the shaver like new.</li>
    <li> Made my razor work better and, much to my surprise, also made it quieter and made the battery last longer.  Seems expensive, but at least it does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> I purchased the electric razor several years ago &amp; it still works flawlessly.  I recently shopped the new panasonic models &amp; after comparing those prices with the price of the combo replacement shaver foil and blade set the decision was a &amp;#34;no brainer&amp;#34;.  My razor now shaves like new &amp; I am quite pleased.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Good to have on hand when the shaver needs replaced.  The price is right for the product.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> The housing cracked within month of purchase. Replacement in warranty cracked at the same place within few days. I purchased Norelco 3D shaver to avoid further Inconvenience, and it works better than Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This set did such a fantastic job I didn&#x27;t think it was working.  No pulling or tugging but close shave. It&#x27;s been about a month or more sand is still doing a great job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the razor with its original blade for over a year and began to be frustrated with its effectiveness. Once I purchased the new blade, it was like night and day! Really cut like a razor blade.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know how dull my Panasonic shaver was until I replaced the blades/foil recently (on my 3rd set).  Now my shaves feel the same when I use my Merkur razor, at 1/3 of the time it takes to do traditional wet shaves.  We&#x27;ll see how long until this set lasts.</li>
    <li> an improvement from worn out cutters I had.  Just like getting a new razor but at 1/2 the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you will see the difference</li>
    <li> Replacement parts were easy to install and they work just fine! Now my face isn&#x27;t so irritated anymore! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I skipped the first recommended change display and kept using the old foil.&lt;br /&gt;When I finally got the new ones, it made a big difference in comfort and shave quality.&lt;br /&gt;Could be cheaper.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do everytime.  Close, clean, quick shave.  Easy clean up.  Recharges in no time flat.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised, and is simple and easy to replace.  I was happy to find it cheaper online than in stores.</li>
    <li> I keep 3 of this razor.  One at home, on in my travel case and one in my other city office.  Very happy with them never a problem. Never an irritation and always a close shave</li>
    <li> I change my foil and blades about once a year.  What a dramatic difference it makes.  Once I put the new items on, I shave in about half the time and the results are much better.</li>
    <li> it is good replacement but original was better</li>
    <li> This product brought new life to my shaver. For the price of this replacement I receive a safer and more affordable shave than ever.</li>
    <li> The shaving blades worked as expected. I did not rate them five stars as they seemed to increased in price recently.</li>
    <li> Actually, the shaver&#x27;s head and cutters last a bit longer than the shaver&#x27;s signal to replace them. I have tried numerous competitors&#x27; shavers, none are as good as this Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install. Makes it feel like a brand new shaver.</li>
    <li> I will buy it again whenever I need some more, I have tried others electric shavers in the past and nothing comes close to my panasonic!</li>
    <li> These used to last longer. I use it 3 to 5 minutes per day. In the past i was able to use it comfortably for 2 years ( perhaps longer the the averave user) This last one did not last one year. I did just order two more direct at half price. We will see if it works more like average.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for years and like it very much. The replacement parts are high quality as they should be. No problems.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping.  Perfect fit.  Will use again.</li>
    <li> Received As Described</li>
    <li> with the replacement foil/blade, my 2 years old shaver works like new, simply great, plan to hold on to this shaver for many years to come.</li>
    <li> These started to give a not as smooth shave only after 3 months, I am not sure if I will be buying another set anytime soon, due to not liking the shaver unit anymore, and wanting to replace it...</li>
    <li> This replacement foil and blades fit my shaver perfectly and works great!  I didn&#x27;t realize how badly I needed new ones until I felt the difference in shave between the old vs. these new ones!  Highly recommend both the shaver and these replacement blades/foils!</li>
    <li> The WES9020pc has the 3 parts needed to restore the ES8243 to like new condition.  The new shaver foil comes mounted in a new head.  The 2 old blades pull easily off and the new blades easily snap on as replacements.  For a lot less than half the price of a new shaver you can have a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Just like the original parts that come with the shaver and work just as good as the original. Good buy</li>
    <li> I didnt get a chance to use it as they shipped the wrong razor but, i gave a 4 stars as i didnt think there should be an issue with the product itself.</li>
    <li> A bit expensive, but the improvement in the razor&#x27;s performance was obvious the first time I used it. It was one of those things you don&#x27;t notice because the degradation in the original razor parts was slow and imperceptible. With the replacement parts, I&#x27;m back to getting a good close shave again.</li>
    <li> It was a pefect fit for one of my all time favorite shavers and at a way less price than I had been looking around for.</li>
    <li> This product is the exact fit. It&#x27;s nice to be able to get one from the manufacture. My razor works like it just came out of the box even though it&#x27;s almost 5 years old.</li>
    <li> After breaking my shaver head during a trip I had to wet shave. It so nice to get back to a decent electric shave and the Panasonic is one of the very best.</li>
    <li> For the cost of the blades &amp; foil (around $40 I think) You get a HUGE... improvement! Just like buying a new shaver for hundreds of dollars less. I have owned a few of these Panasonic shavers, &amp; not a single one has ever failed. The battery just keeps working! The only reason I have bought new ones was to upgrade from 2, to 3, to 4 blades! I can say that the extra cutters really do make for a better shave with less chance of &amp;#34;Pulling&amp;#34; which really hurts. If you don&#x27;t like shaving with the foam &amp; the mess, it is hard to beat these electric shavers. I might upgrade to the 5 BLADE one next, but the new blades &amp; foil brought this 4 blade back to NEW!</li>
    <li> Keeps my face clean shaved and my beard away. I would recommended this product to all that has this type of razor</li>
    <li> This goes with my husband&#x27;s razor.  He loves this shaver and we replace the razor a couple of times a year.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product and gives him a very, very close shave.</li>
    <li> My razor shaves like new again.  Will buy again when the blades get dull.</li>
    <li> Received product quickly. Original Panasonic product, works great, easy to install. Combo pack was not in the manual but found it on line at Amazon, beats buying seperate items.</li>
    <li> They were the parts that I needed for my razor, and I didn&#x27;t need to go to stores to try to find them.</li>
    <li> A one minute restoration to &amp;#34;out-of-box&amp;#34; condition.  Easy, and inexpensive way to achieve a new razor.</li>
    <li> razor does not work very well even with the new blades. Wouldn NOT purchase razor again!!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years, I wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re perfect but I think it&#x27;s as good as it gets when it comes to shaving.</li>
    <li> Restores shaver performance to brand new.  High quality item but can now be found for a lot less on the &#x27;bay (along with cashback rewards.)</li>
    <li> I dropped my shaver and luckly the only thing that broke was the head. This was the exact replacement I needed and it shipped fast. Works Great. Just double check part number as I believe there is a similar but different model.</li>
    <li> I never realized how dull my blades had gotten and am now fully convinced that they need to be replaced yearly.</li>
    <li> I use it for my Panasonic ES8249S Nanotech 4-Blade (Arc 4) Electric Shaver. I replace it every half year but it might be better to replace it more often.</li>
    <li> I used the original blades and foil for almost 3 years (yikes!) Man how time flies...lol...well I thought at first this replacement seemed great, but it seems after a couple of months it&#x27;s not quite as good as the original. Not terrible, but takes a little more effort to get a good shave. Maybe it is still &amp;#34;breaking in&amp;#34; as I know new blades need to do that...we&#x27;ll see...</li>
    <li> Works well with the Panasonic electric shaver.  Foil could be smoother feeling to the skin.  Blades could be sharper to allow for faster shaving.</li>
    <li> For a reasonable price made my shaver is like brand new. I just replaced old parts but if they were damaged I received the new ones fast enough I wouldn&#x27;t have missed a shave.</li>
    <li> Hubby seems to go through these quicker than he should, wondering how good they really are, this is the 3rd one we have ordered, might consider new razor</li>
    <li> These new parts produce shaving better than the original parts that came with the purchase of my electronic shaver. I often had problems with my shaving, either not smooth enough or if I pressed too hard, I would end up with rash. I had to get new Foil because I dropped mine and broke it. But, I decided to get both. And to my surprise, my face had never been as smooth after shaving. And I don&#x27;t have to shave twice a day since these new parts produce very smooth and clean shaving.</li>
    <li> Made my shaver work like new again!!!</li>
    <li> Tried a new Electric Razor and then I asked myself, I really miss my old trusted Panasonic ES8243 Wet/Dry Razor. So I decided to purchase a replacement Foil and Blade set at a cost above a newer razor. Am I glad I did, I have my Shaver back and I am tickled Pink!</li>
    <li> razor is new again, wife loves it</li>
    <li> Well, this is just blades and a screen to refurbish my Panasonic shaver. I have been using Panasonic shavers shaving wet in the shower for something like 35 years. Nothing, but nothing shaves like a Panasonic. They are generally well built, meaning that they run for around four years. My last one was an anomaly in that it died after one year. I spent so much time trying to find one in a new city; I broke down and went for a Norelco. What a piece of garbage. Finally found another Panasonic. I will never stray again. Well, since these things are as rugged as battleships, I replace screens and blades every year, which means a lot of replacements in my lifetime. It&#x27;s just like a new shaver when you do that. I should add that screens and blades are never more than a couple of clicks away, which adds further to the ownership experience. All the stars that shine in the heavens for Panasonic Shavers.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD SEVERAL ELECTRIC RAZORS OVER THE YEARS AND I KEEP GOING BACK TO THE PANASONIC LINEAR MODELS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY ARE QIUCK AND ALWAYS GIVE ME THE CLOSEST SHAVE POSSIBLE&lt;br /&gt;AFTER 18 MONTHS I NOTICED IT WAS TAKING ME LONGER TO GET A SHAVE, SO I BOUGHT A NEW FOIL AND BLADE PACKAGE&lt;br /&gt;NOW IT IS LIKE A BRAND NEW RAZOR&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I have not used the replacement foil and blade set yet, because the razor that I bought it for is too new!&lt;br /&gt;It is convenient though, having the cutter head and blades together in the same pack.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to join the &#x27;automatic shipment program&#x27; as soon as I see how long the blades last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed in Iowa</li>
    <li> I love my Panasonic shaver. It is the only method of shaving that I can do everyday without irritation. I bought the replacement blades &amp; foil after 2 years and 4 months usage of my shaver. The replacing blades &amp; foil was not like the original one. Now after 2 weeks I put my old ones back and I feel they are better than the new one.</li>
    <li> As was my experience with the original blades: really great at first, but by about 3 shaves in, performance has degraded quite a bit. It will sit at that less-than-impressive level for quite a while until you realize you&#x27;re shaving just as long as you had before but not really getting shaved (about a year in). You&#x27;ll buy another blade set.</li>
    <li> yes, fit my husbands razor just fine. He was so happy.</li>
    <li> Annual replacement, big difference.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest, I have been using the original foil and blades for over 4 years.  So I knew it was time to replace them.  I am glad I spent the money, this new set gives me an incredibly close shave and it takes less time to shave in the morning.  I plan to replace on a more regular basis now.</li>
    <li> I like the underlying razor. You need to buy this about every year or so and razor will feel like new.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite razor for shaving with or without shaving cream. He shaves everyday and has sensitive skin so this razor is great for a clean shave without irritation.</li>
    <li> Like getting a new electric razor.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for several years and have always replaced the blades but never the foil.  I then realized that there is a cutter in the foil too, so i decided to replace the foil as well this time.  I am back to the close easy shave that i experienced when i first bought the shaver.</li>
    <li> New and sharper foil design. Cuts even better. Worth keeping your shaver with new heads. I&#x27;ll get one for my other razor I use for travel.</li>
</ol>
