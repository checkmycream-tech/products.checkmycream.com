### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great for foot maintenance!</li>
      <li>This is a great buy for the money.</li>
      <li>A good product.</li>
      <li>To my surprise, My foot felt very smooth.  </li>
      <li>OK boys and girls, I have used Pedispin for a year now and it works well.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t expect more for the price.</li>
      <li>It takes a light touch, patience and some time to gradually work through the build up.</li>
      <li>It will not take a years worth of roughness off quickly.</li>
      <li>Mine went right in the trash.</li>
      <li>Once you get down to fresh, clear skin then using Pedispin regularly will make subsiquent use easier &amp; more effective.</li>
      <li>It really dont work at all</li>
      <li>Late arrival a little but excellent product</li>
      <li>I like is better because it gets all your dead skin off</li>
      <li>I wish it was a slightly different shape to get into the cracks of my fingers, but all in all quite useful.</li>
      <li>Barely works.</li>
      <li>When first contacted with the foot, I applied to much pressure and the tool would slow.  </li>

    <li> Barely works. Couldn&#x27;t expect more for the price.</li>
    <li> This product does not even deserve one star. Awful product. Mine went right in the trash. Does not work well at all. What a waste of money.</li>

    <li> This tool arrived faster than anticipated.  When first contacted with the foot, I applied to much pressure and the tool would slow.  I pulled back and continued the process.  To my surprise, My foot felt very smooth.  This is a great buy for the money.</li>
