      <li>I can´t say if it works yet, but It feels and smells like a strong liquid detergent.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it gave me acne when I tried using it on my face, although it did get rid of the psoriasis effectively.</li>

      <li>I had such faith in this product that it would work, from all of&lt;br /&gt;the positive reviews, but it didn&#x27;t work at all for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used it twice a day so far and am amazed at the difference already.</li>
      <li>So far I have not had any problem with the product itself.</li>
      <li>Despite the light smell (combination of that cetaphil smell and suntan lotion), which really only you can smell really, not everyone around you and the small burn on chaffed and broken skin (lasts about 10 seconds), this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>It works, and no fragrance, cuts the itch and the redness, no more scales, worth every penny.</li>

<li> only have a small patch of psoriasis above my ears and I&lt;</li>
<li> My daughter, 12 years old, injured her hand and arm and instead of healing, the injury went on to produce swollen, hard, scaly skin like you might find with psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
<li> It works for me and does just what it says: relieves skin itch, restores moisture, comforts irritated skin, reduces redness, removes scale, as for fragrance free, its not it... smells again like a terrible moisturizer/sun tan lotion, but the smell is not pungent, only you can smell it really and if you are wearing perfume its probably not noticeable.</li>
<li> when I do get this you can tell the product boxes have been jammed into the packing because of the crushed boxes inside.</li>
<li> Now after only a week&#x27;s use, twice a day applications, the redness is nearly gone, the swelling is at least halved, and the raw, scaly scabs and cracks are noticeably reduced.</li>
<li> So if you are on the fence about this, just try it, its under $10, if it doesn&#x27;t work for you just add it onto that pile of other things that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> I am a 30 year old female with thick wavy hair, this past year was the worst year scalp wise</li>
<li> , my question is why does it burn so bad if its fragrance free ???</li>
<li> My skin on my face is gross to say the least.</li>
<li> The dermatologist presribed varying creams which were expensive and didn&#x27;t really seem to work.</li>
<li> IT ALSO HAS ALREADY STARTED TO CLEAR BEHIND MY EARS!</li>
<li> These red patches itched and covering them with makeup made it worse.</li>
<li> *Use it everyday*</li>
<li> And when I get up in the morning, all the dead skin is just gone.</li>
<li> Seborrheic dermatitis is not going to go away, this isn&#x27;t a cure, its an everyday band-aid for those of us who just cant take it anymore.</li>
<li> it will grow back worse</li>
<li> /&gt;It burned her horribly when we first started using it, because she had a lot of scabs and open wounds from the cracking and peeling skin.</li>
<li> I like it but must use it every day on my scalp to keep the flakes away and not sure what this does to the kidneys,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It sort of hard to remeber to do 3 2 times a day</li>
<li> But after a couple of minutes the burn subsides (plus now I am making a conscious decision to not pick because I know how bad it burns).</li>
<li> You need to remember to apply it at least three times a day.</li>
<li> I have really bad seborrheic dermatitis on the back of my neck at my hair line and behind my ears</li>
<li> I am tired of &amp;#34;dusting&amp;#34; my shirt off and the redness at my hairline.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple weeks and my fetid psoriasis that plagued my skin is gradually going away, getting less scaly and painful.</li>
<li> , my scalp is painful and red, for awhile it was so bad I was pulling scabs off.</li>
<li> Received wrong product.  </li>
<li> I just started using this product but the only thing I hate is that it burns so bad</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it burns, but every scalp medicine burns and</li>
<li> Bad.</li>
<li> Even the sun doesn&#x27;t work :(</li>
<li> I HAVE AWFUL \\&quot;SCALES\\&quot; that seem to come out of nowhere on my scalp.just</li>

    <li> I have moderate psoriasis on my elbows, knees, and hands and I have tried everything to get it cleared up. Even the sun doesn&#x27;t work :( Got this moisturizer on a whim, and it seems to be doing a very nice job of reducing the scales and redness. I am a picker and I constantly was scratching at my plaques so I had a lot of open sores and scabs... and let me tell you this stuff burns like FIRE! But after a couple of minutes the burn subsides (plus now I am making a conscious decision to not pick because I know how bad it burns). Seems like the results are well worth it tho!!</li>

    <li> I had such faith in this product that it would work, from all of&lt;br /&gt;the positive reviews, but it didn&#x27;t work at all for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for four or five months exactly as the product said to,&lt;br /&gt;and EVERY day.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing....absolute nothing .&lt;br /&gt;I only have a small patch of psoriasis above my ears and I&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t tell the slightest difference after using it.&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly the same as when I started applying Dermarest.</li>
    <li> I HAVE AWFUL \\&quot;SCALES\\&quot; that seem to come out of nowhere on my scalp.just recently started moving to the backs of my ears and heading twards my face! EEK! I have been using the tar shampoo for months which helps except you are still left the the UNSCRATCHABLE itchy itch! I just bought this dermarest yesterday from walmart.i put it on anytime it felt itchy and within 3 min it doesnt itch anymore.it feels so amazing to be able to actually be able to relax w/o the itching and squirming. IT ALSO HAS ALREADY STARTED TO CLEAR BEHIND MY EARS! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I did some online shopping and found this product to be of interest and a reasonable price. Happy with results,not too oily feeling</li>
    <li> Received wrong product.  Was supposed to be &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; as my order showed.  Returned.</li>
    <li> I can´t say if it works yet, but It feels and smells like a strong liquid detergent.  It´s just Unbearable!</li>
    <li> I like it but must use it every day on my scalp to keep the flakes away and not sure what this does to the kidneys,&lt;br /&gt;I only have one kidney now,</li>
    <li> Helped me with rosacea acne. I have very sensitive skin so I use the shampoo for cleanser on face then topical. It works wAy better than any acne product. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer regularly and find it to erase the flaky skin I always have had with psoriasis. I wholeheartedly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> Despite the light smell (combination of that cetaphil smell and suntan lotion), which really only you can smell really, not everyone around you and the small burn on chaffed and broken skin (lasts about 10 seconds), this stuff is amazing. **Use it everyday** I have really bad seborrheic dermatitis on the back of my neck at my hair line and behind my ears and I cant help but scratch at it all day long, my scalp is painful and red, for awhile it was so bad I was pulling scabs off. I am tired of &amp;#34;dusting&amp;#34; my shirt off and the redness at my hairline. Within 2 days, the redness has gone down drastically, my scalp is moisturized, my &amp;#34;scales&amp;#34; are smaller and feel better. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it burns, but every scalp medicine burns and if it doesn&#x27;t burn then it doesn&#x27;t work. I have tried everything, been to a dermatologist, had the steroid creams, etc. Seborrheic dermatitis is not going to go away, this isn&#x27;t a cure, its an everyday band-aid for those of us who just cant take it anymore. I am a 30 year old female with thick wavy hair, this past year was the worst year scalp wise and then I found this moisturizer just on a whim about 2 weeks ago and I feel like an addict applying it 3 times a day, and you know what, I don&#x27;t care, I feel so much better. So if you are on the fence about this, just try it, its under $10, if it doesn&#x27;t work for you just add it onto that pile of other things that didn&#x27;t work. It works for me and does just what it says: relieves skin itch, restores moisture, comforts irritated skin, reduces redness, removes scale, as for fragrance free, its not it... smells again like a terrible moisturizer/sun tan lotion, but the smell is not pungent, only you can smell it really and if you are wearing perfume its probably not noticeable.

    <li> It sort of hard to remeber to do 3 2 times a day but i did and all the psor. just rubing of just keep on it ot it will grow back worse</li>
    <li> if you are suffering from psoriasis , this is a miracle treatment. Changed my life after years and years of torture. WOW !!!!</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff for keeping the redness down.  I have been using it for more than a year and it keeps my psoriasis under control</li>
    <li> Dermarest Psoriasis Medicated Moisturizer is awesome. I have used this product for three (3) years. I would recomend this product to anyone with psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I order this from Amazon because I cannot get this in any retail store. There are times though when I do get this you can tell the product boxes have been jammed into the packing because of the crushed boxes inside. So far I have not had any problem with the product itself. I do love this product though. I have used Dermarest ever since it came out on the market and I have had tremendously good results from this product.</li>
    <li> Bad. It was a lotion not the gel as advertised and no packing invoice in the package so I could not return it.</li>
    <li> So I wanted this to work but it only slowed the process and within a week I needed to use my prescription ointment. Plus you need to put it on four times a day and I was always forgetting. So I&#x27;ve now have used this for 2 weeks using the 4 times a day and it actually is working. Yes I feel this is a lot of applying but it works. You need to remember to apply it at least three times a day.</li>
    <li> Of all the different creams I have tried, this one seems to be working the best.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I have sebbhoric dermatitis, and this is literally the ONLY thing that works. My skin on my face is gross to say the least. I peel just about everywhere, and it is embarrassing. But this cream takes it all away. I apply it while I am laying in bed at night about twice. And when I get up in the morning, all the dead skin is just gone. I just lost my bottle, so will be buying another one this week. I can NOT do without this stuff. It is a life saver</li>
    <li> I just started using this product but the only thing I hate is that it burns so bad , I have to use it on my hands because they are scaly, itchy, and red , my question is why does it burn so bad if its fragrance free ???</li>
    <li> It works, and no fragrance, cuts the itch and the redness, no more scales, worth every penny. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Works great on hands, ect. It&#x27;s very effective. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it gave me acne when I tried using it on my face, although it did get rid of the psoriasis effectively.</li>
    <li> When you first use it, it will burn. It doesn&#x27;t burn everyone, but if you&#x27;re reading this you&#x27;re probably feeling the burn, right? Don&#x27;t give up yet. While the pain stings and make you want to wash it off, don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve used this for a couple weeks and my fetid psoriasis that plagued my skin is gradually going away, getting less scaly and painful. If I had to choose burning for a minute vs itching 24 hours a day, I&#x27;d choose the burn, because its worth it.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this lotion at the drug store, looking for cortisone cream. For the last two years, I have suffered from rosacea and also had developed small patches of dermatitis on my face. The dermatologist presribed varying creams which were expensive and didn&#x27;t really seem to work. These red patches itched and covering them with makeup made it worse. I have been using this lotion for 4 days, and my skin looks fantastic! I have used it twice a day so far and am amazed at the difference already. For about $7, I highly recommend you try this product!</li>
