      <li>Great delivery - better than they predicted.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice cream  - not greasy and absorbs well.  </li>
      <li>Feels good on skin and does not irritate skin, for the price, comfortable to over counter products.</li>
      <li>So far I am very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Smells great has a light creamy texture and appears to be working just fine.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>Its very creamy and nice, good product.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>My skin is so sensitive all over and this works beautifully for my skin.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>I have some enlarged pores and fine lines.</li>
      <li>For the price this is a great night facial cream.</li>
      <li>Light weight cream, mild scent and non greasy at all.</li>
      <li>so far so good, too soon to see real differences</li>
      <li>I have been using it for seven days and the brightness of my skin is evident.  </li>
      <li>I have bought more expensive creams which aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
      <li>I do notice that if I apply too much I tend to break out with a bit of acne.</li>
      <li>Seems to even up my skin during the night and does not give me irritation on my very sensible skin</li>

      <li>The last time I got original cream it was in May 2013 from &amp;#34;All Star Source&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The original Dead Sea Anti-aging Night Cream must be non-oily, very soft and with a very mild scent.</li>
      <li>Most night creams are super thick, but this one is not.  </li>
      <li>One review said the jar wasn&#x27;t full mine was low</li>
      <li>only used it for two weeks, but like it very much.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel soft!  </li>
      <li>The price is head and shoulders below that of night creams you purchase for recognizable name only.</li>
      <li>I would strongly advise that you by-pass this- completely a waste of money.</li>
      <li>While clearly not a reflection on the product itself, it is absolutely a reflection on the seller.</li>
      <li>The package arrived today and looks less than half full.</li>

<ol>
    <li> This smells GREAT! Its very creamy and nice, good product.</li>
    <li> luv the way it goes into my skin-luv it</li>
    <li> only used it for two weeks, but like it very much. Seems to even up my skin during the night and does not give me irritation on my very sensible skin</li>
    <li> Love it, but was disappointed that the box had a price sticker fro Big Lots for 3.50.  Will order the product again if it is coming from that seller, it should be that price.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long and am using it in conjunction with micro needling and vitamin C. So far I am very happy with the results. I have some enlarged pores and fine lines. They are greatly diminished.</li>
    <li> The Dead Sea Anti-aging Night Cream with Dead Sea Minerals goes on smooth and greaseless.  Most night creams are super thick, but this one is not.  I have been using it for seven days and the brightness of my skin is evident.  I recommend this night cream.  The price is head and shoulders below that of night creams you purchase for recognizable name only.</li>
    <li> Smells great has a light creamy texture and appears to be working just fine.  Its a great price as an add on</li>
    <li> I ordered this and used it a few times. Personally I found it greasy and difficult for your skin to absorb. Maybe it is just my skin but I was not impressed with this cream.</li>
    <li> It was my favorite night cream, but this time I&#x27;ve received a fake from &amp;#34;Lucky Jade Butterfly&amp;#34; seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is absolutely different. It&#x27;s too oily and doesn&#x27;t absorb well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original Dead Sea Anti-aging Night Cream must be non-oily, very soft and with a very mild scent. When you apply it on your skin it absorbs almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The last time I got original cream it was in May 2013 from &amp;#34;All Star Source&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I noticed that the product does just what it said. Tightening and firming the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great smell and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy and I wanted something just to sort of hydrate my face a bit. This product works. I do notice that if I apply too much I tend to break out with a bit of acne.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to know how I will like it. I have used other Dead Sea products and they were very good.</li>
    <li> Feel the softness of my skin instantly. Light weight cream, mild scent and non greasy at all. Would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It is a nice cream  - not greasy and absorbs well.  It is something I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in how the product arrived- there was no seal on the night cream as there was on the day cream.  While it did not look like there was any missing, it bothered me that it was not properly sealed.  As for the product itself, I have not been using it long enough to rate, but I do like this products line of creams.</li>
    <li> I wish there was less than 1 star. The package arrived today and looks less than half full. The box was wet, and it had obviously leaked out. While clearly not a reflection on the product itself, it is absolutely a reflection on the seller. I would strongly advise that you by-pass this- completely a waste of money.</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me some Dead Sea day time anti aging cream from Christmas. I loved it so much I found Amazon sold it and I ordered four jars of the Dead Sea night cream. It goes on easily and is not greasy.I have bought more expensive creams which aren&#x27;t as good. One review said the jar wasn&#x27;t full mine was low but I figure it settled in shipping.</li>
    <li> Great!  I use this day and night. My skin is so sensitive all over and this works beautifully for my skin. Great delivery - better than they predicted.  Love it.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great night facial cream. Dead Sea minerals can be very expensive. Try it and see .</li>
    <li> Feels good on skin and does not irritate skin, for the price, comfortable to over counter products.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel soft!  I don&#x27;t know that I have seen any less wrinkles but then again, this is only my second bottle and there was the passage of some months between bottles.</li>
    <li> so far so good, too soon to see real differences</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I used it once and coouldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, until I saw it here. Great product. Service from the shipper was awesome as well.</li>
