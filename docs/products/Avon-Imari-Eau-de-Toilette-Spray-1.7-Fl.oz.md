      <li>She loved it.</li>
      <li>She like it&#x27;s a good smell to it</li>
      <li>I got this for my Mom and it is just as described, came quickly and was perfect for a CHRISTmas gift....</li>
      <li>So happy to be able to find this on Amazon since it isn&#x27;t in the Avon catalog anymore.</li>
      <li>Have had this product before and love the smell!  </li>
      <li>Smells great and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>This product is really nice.</li>
      <li>she was thrilled that Amazon sold this product.</li>
      <li>As effective as any Avon Womens Eau De Cologne on the market at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>Wears nicely in the winter with sweaters.</li>
      <li>This product is always part of my fragrance collection where i have most popular products.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I need to buy more.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>love my Imari from Avon.  </li>
      <li>The smell is just lovely.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I really love this Odyssey by Avon.</li>
      <li>I really love this perfum spray.</li>
      <li>I certainly enjoy the scent and so does my hubby!</li>
      <li>It has always been an AVON favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>My favorite purfume ever.wear it</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, exactly as pictured and smells sooooo good!!</li>
      <li>Love this product and hope it will be available for many years to come.</li>
      <li>every day.not to strong either</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sorry, Avon, but you&#x27;re just not in the league with the great perfumes or colognes, and you&#x27;re taking advantage of your buying public by pulling this price hike when many of us would have stayed loyal to your product</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the scent of this cologne -  but to each his own.  </li>
      <li>Its clean, fresh and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I can get Marilyn Miglin&#x27;s Pheremone or Magic for $55 for the same size, and the parfum lasts three times longer (plus I get more compliments on that fragrance, than the Imari when I wear</li>
      <li>but sometimes the old ones are as good or better and we go back to using them.</li>
      <li>There are so many new fragrances</li>
      <li>It is a sweet, gentle perfume.</li>
      <li>The service was super fast.</li>
      <li>I used Imari in the past and started using it again - one of my favorite perfumes and a favorite Avon fragrance.  </li>
      <li>you pay the normal $25 for the 1.2, you can quickly add a few dollars and treat yourself to a fine quality parfum that you&#x27;ll adore as much or more.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Now when I compute that 1.2 ounce (x) the 3.4 ounces I pay for other perfumes that are noticeably more popular and known for their excellence, I&#x27;ve seen Avon raise their price so high, I choose other parfums because they&#x27;re far better than any cologne</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>It has a soft fragrance that is not overwhelming... great for someone who is sensitive to smell.</li>
      <li>They can&#x27;t believe it is an older smell than what the gals are wearing now.  </li>
      <li>I live Imari perfume.</li>
      <li>I wait for the sales like buy one regular and get second one free.  </li>
      <li>This perfume is for old senior citizen ladies.</li>
      <li>I am on a fixed income</li>
      <li>This is not for a 26 year old.</li>
      <li>I only bought it because the description said it smelled like musk, and wild vanilla.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used Imari in the past and started using it again - one of my favorite perfumes and a favorite Avon fragrance.  There are so many new fragrances but sometimes the old ones are as good or better and we go back to using them.</li>
    <li> This is the only one my wife uses. It is a sweet, gentle perfume. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter, who won&#x27;t use any other cologne. The service was super fast. I received it literally days after I ordered.</li>
    <li> I loved this and started buying it in 1985.  Up until about 5 years ago, I could buy this 1.2 ounce for $6 from the Avon lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I compute that 1.2 ounce (x) the 3.4 ounces I pay for other perfumes that are noticeably more popular and known for their excellence, I&#x27;ve seen Avon raise their price so high, I choose other parfums because they&#x27;re far better than any cologne and they last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in 2002, I gave up on this fragrance and switched to the Marilyn Miglin line of fragrances.  I still get my Chanel #5 and even though it&#x27;s gone up in price, we&#x27;re comparing parfum to cologne and Imari doesn&#x27;t last as long, so it&#x27;s become too costly for me to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you pay the normal $25 for the 1.2, you can quickly add a few dollars and treat yourself to a fine quality parfum that you&#x27;ll adore as much or more.  My Chanel #5 comes in a 3.4 ounce bottle - the cost if Imari packaged in that size, would be $75!!!  I can get Marilyn Miglin&#x27;s Pheremone or Magic for $55 for the same size, and the parfum lasts three times longer (plus I get more compliments on that fragrance, than the Imari when I wear it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Avon, but you&#x27;re just not in the league with the great perfumes or colognes, and you&#x27;re taking advantage of your buying public by pulling this price hike when many of us would have stayed loyal to your product had you been sensible about your selling price.</li>
    <li> Love it and price is great!</li>
    <li> I need to buy more. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s one of those aromas that just about anyone would like.  I especially like spraying my clothes and lingerie with it.</li>
    <li> A gift that was requested and the person who wears it loves it.</li>
    <li> This product is really nice. I certainly enjoy the scent and so does my hubby! I will definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> My favorite purfume ever.wear it every day.not to strong either</li>
    <li> I did not know that they still made this !!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother,  she loves it. She has been using this perfume for over 10 years and she was thrilled that Amazon sold this product.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Imari and was delighted to see it being sold here on Amazon. Fast delivery, exactly as pictured and smells sooooo good!!</li>

    <li> [[ASIN:B000JK4HF0 Imari By Avon Womens Eau De Cologne (EDC) Spray 1.2 Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my Imari from Avon.  I have been using it for years and it is the only one that does not cause me to have an Asthma attack.  Thank goodness I love the smell.  And everyone that smells it on me likes it also.  They can&#x27;t believe it is an older smell than what the gals are wearing now.  I wait for the sales like buy one regular and get second one free.  I am on a fixed income so need to watch for specials.</li>
