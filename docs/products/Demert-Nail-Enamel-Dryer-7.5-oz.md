      <li>Works great, however I&#x27;m not crazy about the strong smell.</li>
      <li>I have ordered and used this spray many times</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>But I wouldn&#x27;t be able to recommend this product because of this.</li>
      <li>If more it will take more then 5 min, way more.</li>
      <li>Once it arrived home I checked the ingredients list and guess what were the top two ingredients?</li>
      <li>After I Put All  Coats And Top CoAt on My Nails  </li>
      <li>But what I love most about this spray is that it makes my finger nails and toe nails look like I&#x27;ve just stepped out of the salon.</li>
      <li>I am giving this product 3 stars because the oils in the spray make cuticles look and feel healthy.</li>
      <li>and then you add a top coat</li>
      <li>Many times I polish my nails before going out.</li>
      <li>i love using this when i&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
      <li>it on after your top coat to seal in your nail polish&lt;br /&gt;Hold</li>
      <li>but I believe this is healthy for the cuticles.</li>
      <li>This seems to happen most often with my thumb nails.  </li>
      <li>No doubt my favorite.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically magic.</li>
      <li>Other than that, you honestly cant beat the price for this great product!</li>
      <li>I love to polish my own nails but do not always have the time to allow them to dry and harden, this is a great product to speed up the process</li>
      <li>Unless you like smelling like an old lady&#x27;s cooch, in which case, you might be happy to rate it a fiver.</li>
      <li>And it also smells great, the soft smell resembles baby powder.</li>
      <li>Reasonable price and good size..</li>
      <li>Its easy to apply</li>
      <li>It is a strong smell</li>
      <li>It did have a strong smell</li>
      <li>and I was surprised at the pleasant baby powder scent it had when sprayed.</li>
      <li>works great better than wait for 30+ min &amp; being helpless waiting for the nails to actually dry.</li>
      <li>So overall I&#x27;m happy with it and use it every time I do my nails and will buy again when it&#x27;s out.</li>
      <li>For most of us, we need at least two coats to get the best coverage</li>
      <li>This is a really good product, none better, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
      <li>I would buy this product again and would recommend anyone who enjoys doing  their own nails and who dislikes waking up with sheet imprints on their newly done nails!</li>
      <li>The problem I have with it is that there is a bit of a strong smell to it that is not exactly unpleasant but can be overpowering when using it in excess.</li>
      <li>super fast and effective.</li>
      <li>and I am so excited</li>
      <li>It does give a very finished look to your nails, and it dries the polish very quickly!</li>
      <li>I am happy to say that this product does indeed dry your nail polish!</li>
      <li>This order shipped fast and Seller sent a free gift!</li>
      <li>The dryer is really good and the price is low.</li>
      <li>I almost never buy things for full price, so I got this on sale too.</li>
      <li>You do need to be sure not to use too much, or your nail polish will bubble up.</li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a good product especially when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
      <li>Quickly</li>
      <li>It so good you cant believe and fragure and  how quick dry</li>
      <li>Easy to use and works fast.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fast and easy to spray on the go.</li>
      <li>So today I painted my nails and sprayed this on top and WOW!</li>
      <li>Assuming you did not glop your polish on too much, a quick spray of this large can dries polish almost immediately!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great! Dried my nails quickly and I was surprised at the pleasant baby powder scent it had when sprayed.</li>
    <li> Polish dries in just a few minutes. Leaves a bit of an oily residue but I believe this is healthy for the cuticles. Just wash hands gently after the polish is set.</li>
    <li> Great product worked like a charm</li>
    <li> The dryer is really good and the price is low. It works perfect with two layers of nail polish. If more it will take more then 5 min, way more.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I will definitely be purchasing it again in the future. It is very inexpensive, too.</li>
    <li> Only got to use this twice before it was empty.  It was likely close to empty upon arrival.  Nozzle leaks.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This has saved me so much time. One of my favorite nail polishes is Snow Me White by sinful colors but it takes soooooo long to dry, and with this it takes maybe 5 minutes. I would highly recomend it!</li>
    <li> iv used this product before and love it! helps get ur client out faster so u know they wont smug there polish and hydrates there skin/cuteculs also.</li>
    <li> Good product. But not too fasten dry enough for polish</li>
    <li> I always seem to ruin my nail polish while waiting for them to dry, so I purchased this product hoping to curb that. It seems to work quite well, my only complaint is that sometimes my nail polish bubbles after use. However, that could be from air in the polish and not the spray - I have no idea. I saw some people complaining about the scent of the spray. I have no complaints about it, but I will say that my friend bought another brand of nail drying spray, Onyx professional, and when I used that at her home, it smelled much nicer than the Demert spray. I actually enjoyed the scent of Onyx, while I just don&#x27;t care one way or the other with this. Bottom line, is it does the job I need it to do and I don&#x27;t mess up my freshly polished nails as often now.</li>
    <li> As a person who paints their nails quite often and who is always in a rush, this product was decent. Its easy to apply and it does make a difference in nail drying time. I will continue to purchase/use this product.</li>
    <li> I think my expectations were a bit too high because although  it sped up how fast your nail polish dries, you still have to ait a bit before it hardens all the way. Dents and scratches can still occur if you&#x27;re too rough.</li>
    <li> This makes your nails look like they have been done in a salon.  Also makes the polish stay on longer.</li>
    <li> It does give a very finished look to your nails, and it dries the polish very quickly! I would have given it a higher rating, but the product was half full when I received it. I don&#x27;t know if something went wrong during the shipping process, or if all the cans feel like this, but I do know it was half full when it arrived. Other than that, you honestly cant beat the price for this great product!</li>
    <li> Works great! I use it after every coat and it makes my manicure last longer.  Now I can&#x27;t do my nails without it!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because i like this product&lt;br /&gt;it works well and i would recommend it to anyone that&lt;br /&gt;does not have the patience to wait for their nails to dry.&lt;br /&gt;buy it!</li>
    <li> Really helps drying the nail polish!</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does. Dries nails fast, no more waiting long for nails to dry. The product also shipped very fast. It is a strong smell but so glad this item exist, hated doing my nails until I bought this item.</li>
    <li> I saw this in the store and decided to buy it because I hate waiting so long for my nails to dry sometimes and then still end up screwing them up. The first time I tried it was a fail. I sprayed it on too quick after doing my nails and maybe sprayed a little too much also. For a second I was going to give up on it but I found that if I wait a 30 seconds to a minute and then spray a little on and wait another 30 seconds or so and spray a little bit it works the best. My nails are drying faster now and plus I&#x27;ve noticed my nails have been healthier looking after I started using it. So overall I&#x27;m happy with it and use it every time I do my nails and will buy again when it&#x27;s out.</li>
    <li> What can I say. This is my Go To Nail Enamel Dryer. No doubt my favorite. (Have tried others in my 15 years as a Nail Pro but none come close to this product!)</li>
    <li> I like to do my own manicures at home but the problem is always that it doesn&#x27;t dry quick enough. This bottle has solved all my home manicure problems.</li>
    <li> I want to give this one star because of the stank that fills the room when you use it, but because it actually works, I will forgive it. So, 4 stars--would have gotten five but for the smell.  Unless you like smelling like an old lady&#x27;s cooch, in which case, you might be happy to rate it a fiver.</li>
    <li> I have been in the beauty business for 30 yrs. and have always used DeMert  Nail Dryer. It can be found at grocery stores/drugstores, etc.  Reasonable price and good size..with excellent,quick drying time.  Search it out !! Lorraine</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! If you&#x27;re in a hurry just give your nails a spray of this and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
    <li> It did have a strong smell but it did it&#x27;s job. It did dry my nails but not as quickly as the OPI one. For the price, it&#x27;s a good product especially when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
    <li> Sprayed out half of the bottle and nails are still not dry.&lt;br /&gt;It works so well in the salon, but not when you buy it alone. I dont get it</li>
    <li> The order arrived within the time frame specified.  I use it ofen.  It met my expectations of this type of product.</li>
    <li> Best investment so far! Arrived on time and as described. Dries my nails pretty quickly but you have to apply it after every coat. Don&#x27;t let the coats stack on and then try to dry them, that takes a miracle usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product if you do&#x27;t have the time to just sit there watching paint dry or just don&#x27;t want to feel incapacitated and vulnerable when the enemy attacks at your doorstep. Be prepared.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s realy works after you put the spray wait 3-6 minutes maximum and it will be dray !!!</li>
    <li> Works great, however I&#x27;m not crazy about the strong smell.</li>
    <li> Works like a gem!!! And it also smells great, the soft smell resembles baby powder.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Just don&#x27;t spray too close to your nails</li>
    <li> I really like painting my nails and how they look when they&#x27;re done, but I&#x27;m a very impatient person and can&#x27;t stand waiting for them to dry.  It would never fail that after I felt like I waited an eternity, would get bored, and finally decide it&#x27;s safe to start playing on my phone or something I&#x27;d smudge my polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demert Nail Enamel Dryer to the rescue!  Assuming you did not glop your polish on too much, a quick spray of this large can dries polish almost immediately! It&#x27;s basically magic. Now I can actually fully enjoy doing my nails because I can largely eliminate the whole obnoxious drying process!</li>
    <li> I was blown away by this AWESOME product! Tried it right after I got it and I am so excited cause it really dries my nail FAST! All inpatient ladies who don&#x27;t want to wait should get this!</li>
    <li> I have seen this product in the nail salon before so I figured that it was good. I have learnt that it only dried the top layer of nail polish and it still takes 30 plus mintues for the nail polish to set. As well, the more coats you put on the less effective this nail dry works. For most of us, we need at least two coats to get the best coverage and then you add a top coat and you might as well let it dry normally and save your money. Just my thoughts</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 3 stars because the oils in the spray make cuticles look and feel healthy. Personally, i think this product only knocks off a minute of drying time. When i paint my natural nails and use the spray i feel like i have to wait even longer for my nails to dry.</li>
    <li> It works as it should. It helps nail polish dry quicker, and I used the whole can. I use a quick dry topcoat (Seche Vite) in addition to this type of drying spray and my nails always dry super quickly.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this because she&#x27;s used this at the nail salon. Once it arrived home I checked the ingredients list and guess what were the top two ingredients? Butane and Propane. Yes, gas! I don&#x27;t know about you but she didn&#x27;t want to use something you use to light up things in chem lab, your cigarette lighters, and other things with fire on your hands and nails. It&#x27;s not used in normal aerosol sprays either. The seller never listed the ingredients and because of the type of item this is, it is also non-returnable. Great, huh? Don&#x27;t buy this is you care about what will go into your skin and eventually into your bloodstream.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast free shipping, good stuff. I&#x27;m happy! Easy to use and works fast.</li>
    <li> reorder due to the fact that i like using this</li>
    <li> I was not aware this contains MINK OIL.</li>
    <li> super fast and effective. manicure lasted longer than usual, and pedicure is still going strong! will certainly reccomend to friends.</li>
    <li> Amazing deals on great products. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I do think this helps to dry my nails faster than using nothing at all. You do need to be sure not to use too much, or your nail polish will bubble up.</li>
    <li> This works great...worth the buy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I am happy to say that this product does indeed dry your nail polish! I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this but it definitely works. The problem I have with it is that there is a bit of a strong smell to it that is not exactly unpleasant but can be overpowering when using it in excess. My second problem is that sometime excess is needed. I found myself spraying quite often to get my nails dried sufficiently. I would buy this product again and would recommend anyone who enjoys doing  their own nails and who dislikes waking up with sheet imprints on their newly done nails!</li>
    <li> Works just like the salon!! Great for a quick pedicure touch-up before going out!!</li>
    <li> It so good you cant believe and fragure and  how quick dry</li>
    <li> this sucks didn&#x27;t even work i put on the a nail polish and it was high end it was by butter then i sprayed it on. did nothing just made my fingers cold.</li>
    <li> I thought that this would dry my nails quickly, but it really doesn&#x27;t Also, the scent of it is kind of gross after using it a lot.</li>
    <li> Works great. Shipped as promised.</li>
    <li> Works well. Lid was cracked when I got it, it wasn&#x27;t properly packed I suppose.</li>
    <li> Omg this is amazing,I don&#x27;t know how they complain about the smell, it smells like the spray at the salon. It dries it up very quickly I highly recommend it. I definitely would purchase it again very soon.....</li>
    <li> This product not only makes your nail dry fast, but make your manicure last more (like a week).&lt;br /&gt;It gives you a a very nice finish. Recommend it to all people that have short time and want excelent finish.</li>
    <li> i love using this when i&#x27;m in a hurry. works great better than wait for 30+ min &amp; being helpless waiting for the nails to actually dry.</li>
    <li> I love to polish my own nails but do not always have the time to allow them to dry and harden, this is a great product to speed up the process</li>
    <li> I used this at the salon but didn&#x27;t know you could buy it, until I visited my friend&#x27;s house and she had some.  I just painted my nails and then sprayed a little of this on it.  Normally I feel like my nails take forever to dry - I&#x27;m very impatient and I hate waiting for them - but they dried SOOO quickly, no smudging, and they are super shiny!  I&#x27;m about to pick some up myself.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  With a young child it is very difficult to get any time to paint my nails and when I do I need it to go fast.  This product helps quickly dry my nails so I can paint them and be ready to play with my little one not long after.</li>
    <li> Love it! Bigger bottle then what&#x27;s for sell in stores and cheapier;-)</li>
    <li> The product works well and the nails don&#x27;t become tacky.  Not to mention it is resonabley priced and won&#x27;t break the pocket book.</li>
    <li> I came across this while shopping at Walgreens last week and decided &#x27;hey I&#x27;ll give it a try&#x27;. So today I painted my nails and sprayed this on top and WOW! My nails dried instantly! Usually, whenever I paint my nails, I always end up waiting 30 minutes just for them to dry, and they still somehow ended up ruined, smudged, and even peeled. I&#x27;m going to admit, before I used it, I was skeptical on whether this would work or not, and I thought that maybe it&#x27;s just another product that &#x27;claims&#x27; it&#x27;s benefits and I thought that too much spray would come out of the can, leaving my fingers drippy wet. But this spray is nothing like what I thought it would be, it&#x27;s amazing and sprays to perfection. I noticed that someone mentioned the scent of this smell bad, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with the scent. The scent isn&#x27;t foul or anything like that, it&#x27;s just subtle and goes away immediately. But what I love most about this spray is that it makes my finger nails and toe nails look like I&#x27;ve just stepped out of the salon. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants quick drying nails and a salon quality look :)</li>
    <li> Worked well then to hurry the drying process and my own now works just as well at home. . .I can finish my pedicures much faster without worry of marring the work.  ;)</li>
    <li> I have ordered and used this spray many times and I find it to be a decent aid in drying my nails. I’ll explain in the most informative and least time consuming way I can:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO&lt;br /&gt;Spray it on after your top coat to seal in your nail polish&lt;br /&gt;Hold the can about 5 in. away and spray the entire nail for 3 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Use it with a clear coat to dry nails even quicker&lt;br /&gt;Spray and wait 10 minutes before doing anything that requires yours hands (which is just about everything )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON’T&lt;br /&gt;Expect it dry your nails instantly (still going to have to sit for 10-15 min)&lt;br /&gt;Spray it on inbetween coats (makes your polish sticky and tacky)&lt;br /&gt;Hold the can close to your nail ( painful and makes your fingertip feel frozen)&lt;br /&gt;Spray it and then try to get dressed or shower ( your polish will be pushed back)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall it works great as long as you use it with caution and don’t expect it to instantly dry your nails</li>
    <li> makes my nails stronger.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Dries my nails quickly and the smell is pleasant!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but this stuff really works, and for such an amazing price. I was considering getting a UV dryer because I do my nails every week and get really antsy waiting for my OPI polish to dry for 2 hours, and figure it might be worth the investment. I bought this on a whim because it was only $3 and shipping, and I can&#x27;t believe how well it works. Now I only wait ~20 minutes before my nails are completely dry. It also helps stop my polish from smudging and from getting those annoying hair-like lines after it&#x27;s dry. I can see what people say about the old lady smell, but it&#x27;s easy enough to fix by washing your hands with soap after. Definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this, but it does work. My daughter likes to do nail art, I wanted something a little faster to dry nails. It is great for final drying, if a little cold when you spray it on. I found that after 2 days, with just one coat dried with this, seemed to rub off (keep in mind this is from a SAHM of 3 who homeschools, is active in our Church and cleans a lot) with my daughters nails it did not do this. DO NOT try to use it if you are drying layers between coats (such as 3D type nail art) Seems like a oil type substance goes on nails when sprayed, and art did not look as good. I almost never buy things for full price, so I got this on sale too.</li>
    <li> This product works perfect! one spray and a couple minutes and  you are good to go! This order shipped fast and Seller sent a free gift! Doesn&#x27;t get any better than that! Will purchase again and again</li>
    <li> Okay This Product Is Amazing!! i Usually Spray This On My Nails After I Put All  Coats And Top CoAt on My Nails  Then Spray Back And Forth Quickly But DO Not Hold It Too Close .. My Nails  Dry Instantly Every Time No Joke ! And It Was Shipped Extremely Fast!</li>
    <li> This spray works great!  I spray it between coats of polish and it dries it completely within minutes.  I have used this spray for years and get it at Sally Beauty Supply.  It doesn&#x27;t dull the shine, like so many nail enamel dryers do.  Yes, it&#x27;s pretty stinky, but the smell dissipates quickly.  It has always worked well for me and I will continue to use it for years to come.  One can lasts a really long time, and I even paint my nails once a week or more.  I only have to buy a couple of cans a year.  This is a really good product, none better, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t tell how fast this dries but after 5 mins i still manage a smudge so i end up using drying drops</li>
    <li> Whenever I don&#x27;t go to a manicurist for my manicure, I use the Demert Nail Enamel Dryer to dry my nails.  It works great and I&#x27;m on my way out the door in no time......</li>
    <li> REALLY WORKS WELL IN DRYING THE POLISH ON MY NAILS. WILL SAVE ALOT OF HEADACHES WHEN I DO MY MANICURE</li>
    <li> Price was great and the shipping was fast&lt;br /&gt;Tnxs 👍☺️ Gina</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully and not only dries nails faster, but leaves a pleasant sheen.  There is also no unappealing odor.</li>
    <li> It quickens the pace of drying, so i dont have to worry so much about waiting SO LONG for it to be rock solid. I thought it dried right away at first-- it doesnt. it just makes the process faster.</li>
    <li> Because the product was prompt and it works incredible and it&#x27;s fast and easy to spray on the go. Thank you</li>
    <li> This Is Just What I Needed ! but it really smells BAD&lt;br /&gt;I hold my breath when I spray it , Try to tolerate the smell in the sake of saving the time !</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years. Nice to find a seller that sells it for a great price and fast delivery. I spray it on my two coats of polish and immediately go about my business. Nails dry instantly. Don&#x27;t go anywhere without a can of this in my purse.</li>
    <li> works for drying my nail polish fast and does not leave an oily residue</li>
    <li> It works pretty well.  My nails are dry enough to do almost anything after 30 minutes, and that&#x27;s with 4 coats of polish (1 ridge filling base coat, 2 color, 1 top coat).  This works much better than the several types of nail drying oil drops that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After using this product several times, I still agree that it works pretty well.  One thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is if you&#x27;re using more than 1 - 2 layers of any type of polish (I use a base coat, 1 - 2 coats of color and a top coat) the nail polish tends to pool in the creases around my nails.  If I use this product before that part has settled and dried, the nail polish on the side of my nail dries, but doesn&#x27;t adhere to my nail, so I end up losing a bit of nail polish from the side of my nail.  This seems to happen most often with my thumb nails.  I would recommend letting it dry a bit more before using this or using this on 2 or fewer layers of polish.</li>
    <li> Love this product as it helps dry my nail polish very quickly.  I can not live without it! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I always saw it at the nail salon, but never thought to buy some for home use. It works great and always dries my nails really quick!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Smells pretty terrible though. I would be careful around pets or small childred</li>
    <li> So good that I haven&#x27;t dared show it to my neighbors yet.</li>
    <li> Not satisfied. I sprayed on twice to make sure my polish dries properly. The I had accidently touch my nail and it smudged. and I&#x27;ve been using it to be proven wrong but nothing results were still the same. Someone recommended me this product and it did not work like I hoped.</li>
    <li> It really drys enamel</li>
    <li> I only got to use this product for one manicure, and about a &amp;#34;half of a hand&amp;#34; on a second one, before the can was completely empty. I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective can or what. But I wouldn&#x27;t be able to recommend this product because of this. One expects to use a can of nail quick dry more than once. It generally takes me months to use up a can.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t reallly work nearly as well as the nail salons nail dryer spray works. It just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> Speeds up the drying process, but not by too much.</li>
    <li> While I do tend to sit still for a while my nails dry, I still feel better spraying them with a drying assistant.&lt;br /&gt;This works great and was priced well.</li>
    <li> Great product! Many times I polish my nails before going out. Great for last minute touch ups that need to dry quickly</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what are all those good reviews about. I didn&#x27;t work on me. Maybe you should spray from very close and aggressively.</li>
    <li> Works good. Has a floral smell</li>
    <li> Came before expected, works like the other ones ive bought before! I do recommend to anyone working with clients, comes in handy</li>
