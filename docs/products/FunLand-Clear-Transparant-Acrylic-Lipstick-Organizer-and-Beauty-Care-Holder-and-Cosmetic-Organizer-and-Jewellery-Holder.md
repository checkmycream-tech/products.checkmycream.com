      <li>Perfect for lipstick!</li>
      <li>Perfect for all my lip products and great quality!</li>
      <li>Awesome fits all my lipsticks thank u !!!!:)</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>so I would just recommends this for people who own man LIPSTICKS.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Better tan putting in a case you can see every color, no problem.</li>
      <li>Great idea but my lip glosses and some lipsticks fall over because the space is larger than the product.</li>
      <li>Amazing item fast delivery AAAAA+++++</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s a nice large pretty display!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>This is a very food lipstick organizer but not for lip glosses.</li>
      <li>Very well made.  </li>
      <li>The slots are a bit large for most of my lippies wish they ran the slots a smidge smaller but overall 36 slots for $17 is a deal!!!!</li>
      <li>I am definitely planning on buying more in the near future.</li>
      <li>Not even short lipsticks stand up straight.</li>
      <li>If this thing gets bumped when full with lipsticks they all fall out or fall over SUPER IRRITATING having to constantly stand everything back up, especially if its full like mine.</li>
      <li>I wish the holes were a little deeper so the lipsticks would stand straight</li>

<li> and for the my regular size mac, nars, and other lipsticks, it wasn&#x27;t deep enough either.</li>
<li> No more buying the same lipstick twice.</li>
<li> They fall down</li>
<li> I ordered this for my MAC lipsticks and possibly a few lip glosses.</li>
<li> sturdy and heavy</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> The thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this is that the slots are to shallow.</li>
<li> but wells are  shallow and some lipstick tubes tip.</li>
<li> Looks expensive and decorative.</li>
<li> So shallow!!!</li>
