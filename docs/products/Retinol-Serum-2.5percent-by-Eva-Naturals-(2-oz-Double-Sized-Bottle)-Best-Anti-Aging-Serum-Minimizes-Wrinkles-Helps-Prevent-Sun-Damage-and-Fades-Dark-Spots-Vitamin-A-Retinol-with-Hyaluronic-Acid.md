<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am addicted to serums and this is better than PTR, watts Beauty, dr. Dense, Estée Lauder, and serious skincare.  There is nothing better than exfoliating then applying this product.  It instantly absorbs into skin and smoothes and tightens. I apply it twice a day. I will be getting the whole line, it is so affordable..</li>
    <li> Already see a difference in my face! Would recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> Seems to be a great product! I mix it with my moisturizer with peptides for my nightly care. My skin seems to love it. People tell me that my skin looks great. YAY!</li>
    <li> This product feels good on my skin.  Feels healthier too.  Does not gunk up either.  I don&#x27;t feel the prickle sensation.</li>
    <li> Great value and really works.</li>
    <li> Great price for an aging skin essential. Nothing works like retinol. Product feel like cosmetic counter serums that cost four times as much.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a friend of mine and she is in love with this product!  I&#x27;ve noticed her lines look smoother and less visable.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum. It absorbs quickly and it&#x27;s very light feeling.  I love retinol creams but often they will creep into my eyes or mouth. This doesn&#x27;t happen with this serum because it soaks into your skin very quickly. I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s WONDERFUL!!  Used it for the first time this morning, followed by my moisturizer and my skin definitely feels tighter and looks smoother.This is a MUST HAVE in my collection of skincare products.  I&#x27;m going to be giving this serum to friends for upcoming birthdays and Christmas,2015!!  I&#x27;m so glad this product popped up while shopping at Amazon for other items.  I&#x27;ll be using it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a 5 star!! I&#x27;ve been using this along with a derma roller and have seen a significant difference! It&#x27;s not oily at all, and a little goes a long way! I bought this after reading review after review of awesome feedback! I do recommend getting a derma roller along with this serum, I use the derma roller first (if you&#x27;ve never used one you can youtube it) then I apply this directly afterwards! This is a great product and is shipped fast and has incredible customer service! Gotta love small businesses!</li>
    <li> very fast shipping and great product!!! It makes my skin smooth, it also helps towards my skin having anneven skin tone. It is also scent free and non irritaging.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! Glad i gave it a shot</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a few days and already I can see and feel the difference. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This works very well . Helps lessen fine lines and deep wrinkles . Easy to use . My face is so much softer . I will be buying it again .</li>
    <li> I really like this product!&lt;br /&gt;Not at all drying like some other retinol products I have used.  The serum feels nice on my skin and not at all sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my skin is smoother and fewer blemishes.</li>
    <li> This is really doing to my skin what retinol is suppose to do.  It lessens and softens the fine lines plus, it makes my skin have more of a glow to it at 55 years of age.  Evens out my complexion quite a bit while tightening up the skin as much as a skin product can do.  Works better than all of the other retinol products I have used!</li>
    <li> Love it , it makes my face feel so smooth, we will see in time about the fine lines i have been only using for a week ,great seller i will continue to shop with them</li>
    <li> Just started using this serum and liked that it absorbs quickly.  Leaves skin soft and hydrated!  I certainly will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I hope that this gets rid of my wrinkles.  I am only 29 years old.  I don&#x27;t want to look old.</li>
    <li> love it! thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very , VERY happy with this product!  I cannot wait to get the vitamin C next!  My lip lines from being a former smoker are GONE!</li>
    <li> Wow! Tightens my skin and wrinkles but yet my skin still feels soft. Thank You</li>
    <li> fast Shipping. good quality. is fully consistent with the description</li>
    <li> This goes on very nicely.. I have only had a chance to use it a few times but I do like the way it feels.</li>
    <li> I received the product a day early and was pleasantly surprised it was a larger bottle than I had expected. I have been using it for about 2 weeks. I think I need to use it a little longer, but so far I&#x27;m pleased with the results. I have used other serums in the past, which were more expensive and had less in it, and I actually prefer Eva naturals. I will post back in a few weeks. I have been using Eva naturals retinol serum for about 6 weeks now. I use it once in the morning and once in the evening.  I do like it, and have order another bottle. I think my skin feels firmer and my lines my my mouth seem shallower. I like the fact that I can use it on my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t sting. I don&#x27;t use eye cream anymore, only this.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. I have tried several retinol serums. Normally they are very drying or they irritate my skin and cause it to become red. I did find if I use a retinol serum just twice a week, my skin can handle that. I have been using Eva Naturals Serum for two weeks and I am already seeing a difference in my skin. My skin is more even, my skin now has a healthy glow, and my fine lines are less noticeable. I use it every night before bed. It has never irritated my skin. I love this serum!</li>
    <li> Really a great product and good price. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this serum!  My skin feels wonderful! I&#x27;ve not been using long, but I do feel a difference.  It&#x27;s not sticky feeling and does great under your makeup.</li>
    <li> I promise to leave a review</li>
    <li> Excellent  Good results and I like the dispenser and size.</li>
    <li> Very well spread on the face, the face remains matte. It does not cause irritation. The smell neutral. I am very happy. I would recommend</li>
    <li> this serum is fantastic! feels and works great! it was delivered quickly and at a low price.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical trying so many things in the past and especially with having combination skin. I can gladly say that this soaks right in to my skin with no issues, doesn&#x27;t stay on top of the skin and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I am a fan!</li>
    <li> Not as rich and creamy as I&#x27;m used to with other serums.  Not seeing anything special about how it&#x27;s working, but it&#x27;s a big bottle so I&#x27;ll continue to use it and hope for results.</li>
    <li> Love it skin is firmer will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I use every evening, including dabbing it under my eyes and on my eyelids.  My skin feels great!  I&#x27;m 64 and of course want to look younger, so this is the perfect product for just that, and I do look younger.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! I use it day and night and it seems to be smoothing my desert-dry skin (I actually live in the desert, and my skin suffers for it). The customer service was wonderful and I look forward to doing business with Eva Naturals again soon.</li>
    <li> I love it.. Got here in time and been using it for almost 2 weeks now. My skin is noticeably smoother. I got a rolladerm that I can&#x27;t wait to use it with.</li>
    <li> Been using this for I week now and I&#x27;m in love awesome price and if it keeps working this well definitely will be buying again!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice and smoothly applying product which softens my skin.  I also like the amount for the price.</li>
    <li> The product absorbs quickly into the skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a oily film. My skin feels somewhat tighter. The product will last a long time, good size bottle and a little goes a long way!!!</li>
    <li> My face seems to be somewhat smoother since taking this Serum and I will re-order.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum twice daily for 7 days (morning and night) and my skin tone is already significantly more even. I&#x27;m not sure if that is even what this is for but my uneven skin tone is my biggest skin issue and I am incredibly pleased. So pleased that yesterday I ordered another bottle so I always have some on hand. Love this product so far. Highly recommend it, and you cannot beat the price!</li>
    <li> I received it this morning. I know things do not happen over night. I used it this morning and this evening going to church. It feel so good; my skin just soaked it up! My skin looked so nice, supple, and smooth with this under make up. Impressed!!! Excited to see the results after long-term use!</li>
    <li> would recommend to friends!</li>
    <li> I have only used this serum for about a week, it does help to firm the skin in my post problematic areas of my face and leaves my skin smooth looking. The smell is good and easy to apply. Will report back once I have used it a little longer to give a full review.</li>
    <li> I love this product - my face feels so soft</li>
    <li> This product has earned a place in collection!  I have sensitive skin and thought for sure this would be harsh on my skin but it wasn&#x27;t!  This was a great way to try Eva Naturals and earn a client for life!</li>
    <li> I have been using this retinol product for a few weeks now. I like how well it absorbs into my skin and I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the irritation that can sometimes happen when using retinol products. I can&#x27;t tell if my skin has improved yet but I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin so soft and I only need to use a little bit!  I received this as a promotional offer, and think it&#x27;s worth full price!</li>
    <li> Took about 30 days to start seeing improvement</li>
    <li> I like the texture and it soaked in well.  I have noticed my skin is softer,smother and softer laugh lines.</li>
    <li> It is very nice and I have not broken out. The last retinol I used broke me out horribly.&lt;br /&gt;This one is working well for me.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much! It does reduce the appearance of the wrinkles on my forehead and under my eyes.  One does need to be careful when applying around the eyes. I accidently got a wee bit too close one day and it does not feel good. It has also seemed to clear up my skin a little bit.  All together a good product!</li>
    <li> Great product.. Happy customer!!</li>
    <li> I just love it, it soaks right into your skin. It&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Still using it, love it, will keep using</li>
    <li> Just started, but it looks extremely helpful.  I was advised by dermatologist to use vitamin c am and  a retinol am. I love natural products and am very pleased with  this  one!</li>
    <li> I like this product and recommend it to others. My skin feels and looks better.</li>
    <li> This serum feels wonderful on my skin, soaks right in. I feel like I&#x27;m doing something great for my skin when I put it on at night under my nighttime moisturizer. Just started using it last week and I&#x27;m seeing a difference in my skin already.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Makes my skin more taut and is a great moisturizer. I am in my late 30s and have crinkles at the corners of my eyes. Ive been using this 3 weeks now and already have noticed a lessening in appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Thankyou! I did receive this at a reduced price for an homest review.</li>
    <li> I started using this serum about 2 years ago. When I was 42 years old I was considering plastic surgery on my face because of the crows feet. I said, &amp;#34;let me try this serum,what do I have to lose.&amp;#34; Well, I do not regret buying it. I wear it under my foundation and my crows feet have disappeared. The oily skin that used to pertrude  out of my foundation is a thing of the past. I swear by this serum and I already told my sister in florida thst she has to join the wagon. I swear that this is the truth. I never ever give anybody any reviews but this stuff works. Forget any negative comments and just buy it. I&#x27;m always a skeptic because i have a scientist mentality but this works.</li>
    <li> I have been used for 1 month now. I can tell the differences of my face smoother, brighter...  Awesome!</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. So far, I am loving the Eva Naturals Retinol serum! I have not had any redness or irritation which was my main concern using a retinol product. I have skin that is very finnicky. It will be ok one day, then irritated the next. I have used this product for a week with no irritation so I am pretty confident I will be able to continue using it until it is gone with no problem. My skin feels smooth and soft after use, and I do follow with a moisturizer after using the serum. If you use this during the day, you will still need to use sunscreen. So far I am loving it!</li>
    <li> Got for my mom and she said she can feel/see it working!</li>
    <li> I love it !! In about a couple of weeks my  complexion is brighter, seems to plump up where my face had sorta of lost its youthful plumpness and wrinkled, I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight and I was really encouraged buy the product..  you can&#x27;t beat the price!!  I&#x27;m excited about continuing the product and  the results as they progress, as I&#x27;ve seen ,quite a pleasant and noticeable difference and such a little time.</li>
    <li> I am extremely delighted with this product. I use it morning and night. My face is glowing!</li>
    <li> Love it, it really works</li>
    <li> I have been using this Retinol serum for only about a week, but so far I am very pleased,  It feels very good on my face.  I really like the fact that this seller gives helpful hints and instructions for use of the product via email.  I will surely be a return customer.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Makes my skin soft and firm!</li>
    <li> Just started using this product recently. So far so good. The scent is okay and the product goes on good without leaving your skin feeling sticky or gross.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. My skin feels so soft and has more elasticity! I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time but feel that I can already see and feel a difference</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been enjoying this serum. No irritation or breakout after using. Love this light gel texture. My skin tone looks brighter now. It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks, so I will update this review after finishing the bottle. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used this a few times. I do not notice a difference, but its isnt causing any issues either. I need more time to use it to give an actual answer as to if it works or not. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast. Product has a pump so easy dispense . Goes on very nice and leaves skin smooth with first application. Only been using for 3 days so can&#x27;t comment on results yet. No odor or sticky feeling. Very good customer service !!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Eva Naturals Retinol Serum on a Wednesday, I believe, and had it by Saturday of that same week.  Once receiving it, I was very excited to try it.  I am an avid shopper and user of anti-aging products, and I have used literally hundreds of products searching for the &amp;#34;miracle in a jar&amp;#34;.  I have used it for a couple of weeks since receiving it.  Honestly, I do not see any difference in this serum from many of the others I have used.  It is okay, but not any better than any others I have used. I gave this product 4 stars for their expeditous delivery. I probably will not order this again, but I am not saying I would not purchase a different product from them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a prescription cream called Retin-A (also generically called Tretinoin cream) for practically all my adult life to help control acne. With the recent changes in health care, my insurance would no longer cover the cost of even the generic version, sighting it as &amp;#34;medically unnecessary&amp;#34;. The out of pocket cost for just the generic version is close to $200!  So I went searching online for an alternative and discovered Eva Naturals version of my life-long supplement for healthy skin. It is every bit as effective as the prescription cream! I have extremely sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m using the same procedure as I used with the prescription type, which is to mix a drop or 2 with about one dispenser pump of Cetaphil moisturizing cream. I&#x27;ve been using it every night for almost 2 months now and have experienced no irritation or other side effects what so ever. My acne has settled back down very nicely, and my skin looks very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** VERY IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ*****&lt;br /&gt;  If you do decide to try this product, for whatever reason, START USING SUNSCREEN DURING THE DAYTIME! ... atleast SPF 30. I learned years ago when I first started using Retin-A that this type of skin supplement makes your skin much more susceptible to sunburn. It&#x27;s not an issue to make you pass up trying this fantastic product, just something to be aware of.... just consider it some extra protection and a small price to pay for the benefits of this product. With that said, I can highly recommend Eva Naturals Retinol Serum. I myself intend to keep using it indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week as I wanted to replace another retinol product that broke me out.  So far, I really like this serum (especially since it also has hyaluronic acid in it, too). It goes on great and absorbs quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue.  You also get a lot of product for your money. As far as skin improvement with it, only time will tell. But I can say that I have not had any reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update:  I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and love it.  It feels nice going on, absorbs quickly, has a mild pleasant scent, and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  It is gentle enough not to irritate my skin like other retinol products but it does work (I can feel my face get that slight sunburned feeling if I put it on and haven&#x27;t used it for several days).  The bottle is pretty large, but when it runs out I won&#x27;t hesitate to order again</li>
    <li> I am over 50 years old, and my face (skin) has had such bad reactions to most products I have tried over the past 30 some years, that I relied on a very few, simple, common products every other day to avoid skin chemical burnout, or pimples. My skin is damaged by the lack of appropriate care, moisture, and the sun and pollutants. I have very deep long wrinkles. My skin has always been nearly translucent.&lt;br /&gt;A friend suggested I try some products and do some research. The reviews on Amazon have been very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I chose This serum to use at night after I found some other products that my face loves, and after reading about methods of use that are tried and true--and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;This serum is gentle. My face has not had any bad reaction. I started by trying this at night. I was amazed that there was no burning! I tried it the next night. No burning. I have now used it one night and one day and one night. No burning. I am very excited!&lt;br /&gt;Today, I noticed that the top layer of skin is sloughing and beneath is bright beautiful smoother skin!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect anything to undo all of the skin damage, or wipe away so much wrinkling, but I see a difference with my first week of a full daily skin care regimen, and my husband has also noticed a difference already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to post more after a month or two-- three would be best. I love this serum, and thank all of the people who post honest reviews on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Item arrived a few days before expected. I just began using it a week ago and believe it&#x27;s too soon to see any difference in my skin jet, I will post another feedback within a few days. The price and the size couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Great purchase! Really worked well! Very happy customer! would buy again!</li>
    <li> Great product, I think anyone could benefit. It absorbs almost immediately, no residue. I have oily skin (still, though I&#x27;m no teenager) and was worried this would be too heavy but not the case at all. So easy to use since it quickly melts into you skin. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent serum. Just a couple of drops is all you need and it sinks into the skin without a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!!  It absorbs quickly with no sticky feeling after it has dried.  It makes my skin feel so soft.  A great buy on so many levels!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using different retinol products for awhile but either had a lot of dryness from the serums or occasional breakouts from retinol creams. This product is an excellent balance between the two, not too drying and not too heavy. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month but so far this product is working out great for me. My skin is soft and although it hasn&#x27;t been long, I think it works as well, if not better, than a more expensive product I used before trying Eva Naturals. I will buy again and would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I did not like this because it was gel and not moisturizing. It made my skin feel tight and dry. I will not purchase again. I wanted to like it. I mix it with my lotion and use it on my neck it works ok that way.</li>
    <li> Love this product, will re-order soon, no scent seems to put some life in a medium aged face, do love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Super fast shipping, great seller.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I like this product so far- I don&#x27;t experience the tightness as mentioned in other reviews, but I have noticed a difference in the fine lines and wrinkles. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product- gives good coverage, which I like. Pretty good price point.</li>
    <li> Loving the hydration this product provides.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.  I purchased this product as a promotional deal but definitely will reorder.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome and I just ordered a second bottle of serum today so that I don&#x27;t run out.  After trying the retinol from Eva Naturals I have ordered 2 more serums from them as well.  The results after only a couple of weeks is amazing!  My skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft since highschool.</li>
    <li> I love how soft my face is getting</li>
    <li> Nice product face looks smoother</li>
    <li> Eva Naturals Retinol Serum feels as though it is tightening my skin!</li>
    <li> I have only been using it a couple weeks now and have noticed my skin is smoother and it does feel better.  Will come back in a month or two for another review of the results.</li>
    <li> Works.. makes my wrinkles smaller and less noticeable. Light weight and smeels nice</li>
    <li> This stuff works great at a great price and prompt delivery.highly recommend will buy again.customer for life.you couldn&#x27;t ask for more in a serum.:)</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I use this with Eva Naturals Eye Gel-great duo!!! I have tried to use good skin care my whole life (not necessarily the most expensive) but since starting to use these products, people have actually asked me what I&#x27;m doing because I look younger-nice compliment at 51 :) I can&#x27;t wait to find moisturizers to start using in their line as well!</li>
    <li> I have been using Eva Naturals Retinol Serum for 2 weeks so far. I am using it once a day at night. After cleansing my face i apply it on dry skin. It takes just a moment to dry and then I apply my night cream. I can say that I do notice a softer smoother texture to my skin. I am an older woman and did not expect amazing results but am quite pleased with my &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34; face.</li>
    <li> This serum is really good! My skin becomes smoother and lighter after just a few time used. I used to stick to the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Retinol cream, but I prefer this serum because it&#x27;s natural!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Saw an improvement in my skin in approximately 9 days. I highly recommend this product. I need to be careful for a lot of times I breakout fro products such as these. With this one , I did not.</li>
    <li> Nice formula, I like the fact it has no fragrance, and so far has been really good to my skin - thanks!</li>
    <li> Retinol is one of my favorite skincare products!! This is great for ladies who are looking for an anti~aging serum! I started using retinol at an early age for acne and also to keep my face looking fresh from my melasma, which is discoloring from birth control. This is an excellent choice for fine lines, acne, acne scars, and discolorations, evening pigment and many other things. I was given a deep discount on this product to provide honest feedback.</li>
    <li> I really love this. It works amazing.. I think you would love it also. And feel that you should try it also.</li>
