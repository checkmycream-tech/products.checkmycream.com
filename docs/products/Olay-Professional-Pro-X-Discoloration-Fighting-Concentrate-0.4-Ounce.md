      <li>I respect Olay products and have always had good results</li>

      <li>I think it works better!</li>
      <li>I put on more than was required, but that&#x27;s just me!  </li>
      <li>You will save sometimes more than 1/2 price!   </li>

      <li>Nice consistency.  </li>
      <li>It is evening out my complexion and my face feels better.</li>
      <li>I LOVE Olay products, but this one didn&#x27;t work???...</li>
      <li>I am hoping for more results with time.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>ive had a couple weeks and already see a difference:)</li>
      <li>I am not quite so sure about this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and Olay decided to stop making it.  </li>
      <li>The price was much better than any store  </li>
      <li>Olay pro-x is the top of the line.</li>
      <li>It works better.</li>
      <li>The entire line of Olay Pro X is excellent.</li>
      <li>and it has done an ok job.  </li>
      <li>I was most concerned with on my forehead.</li>
      <li>I am so happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen thus far.  </li>
      <li>The brown splotches have faded significantly to where I can barely see them so this product has worked great for me.  </li>
      <li>Am I happy with the overall result, yes.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to order at Amazon where I&#x27;ve found the lowest price and free shipping.</li>
      <li>The product is light and non-irratating .</li>
      <li>Now, as a side note, my face is otherwise blemish free</li>
      <li>My most beautiful wife (59 years old but looks 35 years old) swears by and has used Olay products for years.</li>
      <li>I have gone through many tubes of many brands and after using this entire tube I can safely throw it in the \\&quot;didn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I used it twice a day for a week now and my two spots have faded significantly.  </li>
      <li>Besides having good results from Pro X, my favorite thing about the product line is that there is absolutely no fragrance.</li>
      <li>My age spots are fading right before my eyes!</li>
      <li>I used it religiously twice a day for a good 4 months (never missed an application).  </li>
      <li>The eye products were full and, again I see no difference in my appearance.  </li>
      <li>No bad smell.  </li>
      <li>I thought trying something new from a reputable brand at a much higher price point may yield better results.  </li>
      <li>The first couple of days were fine.  </li>
      <li>even when I use SPF 30, also I am pregnant this summer.</li>
      <li>has helped me tremendously -</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works great for dark skin spots.</li>
      <li>I do like all the regular Olay products though and have gotten so many compliments on the \\&quot;touch of foundation\\&quot; creams!</li>
      <li>It arrived right on time.</li>
      <li>And oh, the cream is not heavy; it easily disappears and is absorbed into the skin, and spreads around even though the application is like a pen and deposits cream with precision.</li>
      <li>It arrived very fast</li>
      <li>This product works great, completely fades my sun spots on my face and no irritation I have had with other products.</li>
      <li>I have had two brown spots for 30 years and decided to try this because of the cheap price before I spend more money on other items.  </li>
      <li>Very surprised and excited about how well it works.</li>
      <li>With so many products on the market that claim to get rid of brown spots, I cannot believe they are getting rid of one that actually works.</li>
      <li>, only more stinging sensation, so switching to Olay was a bargain.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used this product consistently and there is a consistant improvement on both sides of my face.</li>
      <li>I tried this olay product for the first time for about a week, putting it on twice a day (once in the morning and once at night).   </li>
      <li>My first time using this product.</li>
      <li>I am just about finished with my first tube of this product, and frankly, I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes at all.</li>
      <li>However, I do see a difference with consistent use.  </li>
      <li>I stopped using this Olay product after that first week.  </li>
      <li>I put this product on 3 itsy bitsy spots on my upper cheeks, and within 15 minutes both of my cheeks, part of my nose and chin turned bright red and started burning.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes it has a natural scent that&#x27;s offensive to many of us who are sensitive.</li>
      <li>Another one, less visible on the side of my face, has been less successful but hoping more time passing will help.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed any significant lightening of the sun spots after a little over a month, though I will continue to use the product and give it some more time.</li>
      <li>When you use this just barely put a dab on the spot that you want to treat, it is easy to put to much.</li>
      <li>I chose this rating because it didn&#x27;t really work as well as the first tube I purchased in store.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s still within good expiration.</li>
      <li>I had age spots on both cheeks and one rather large brown patch (melasma)</li>
      <li>Be sure to use a moisturizing cream after use as you skin get very dry.</li>
      <li>This really worked for me -- I&#x27;m still in awe.  </li>
      <li>For now it looks promising.</li>
      <li>It really worked for me.</li>
      <li>I expected better results on lightening/removing brown spots.</li>
      <li>And the price seems reasonable to me.</li>
      <li>you dont have to use much.</li>
      <li>I believe this combo is really helping.</li>
      <li>Very goood for your skin, as you age.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really see any change in the brown spots on my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product did ABSOLUTELY nothing that it said it would.  </li>
      <li>Age spots on  my face are fading fast with twice-daily applications.</li>
      <li>The real test will be in the summer when they tend to darken.  </li>
      <li>I use it in the morning under sunscreen-I dab the product on the spots and gently rub it in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for over a year and it has significantly faded several spots on my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t remove any dark spots,but made them more visible.</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t throw your packaging/receipt away if the same holds true for you.  </li>
      <li>I only plan to use this one more week and save the rest for any future spots that may show up.  </li>
      <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
      <li>Promising so far.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it until the tube is empty to see if I can get them to fade completely, but I would be totally satisfied with the level of lightening at this point because I&#x27;m probably the only one who really notices them at this point.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m searching for a new product.</li>
      <li>When after 2 morning visits to the pool I noticed new and darker sun spots on my face, I ran to the store and bought Olay for $36.50 with coupon.</li>
      <li>Retin-A seems to be the only way, you just have to get used to it at first.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure that it will remove it completely at this rate, but lighter is better than nothing.</li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t think my spots will totally go away.</li>
      <li>When I put powder on, you can nearly see them.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I chose this rating because it didn&#x27;t really work as well as the first tube I purchased in store. There&#x27;s no expiration date on the product. Therefore, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s still within good expiration. No, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product when it came out in what I believe was February of 2009 and used it for about 2 1/2 months with not one result. I have sun spots and put this cream on religiously every day and saw no change. Retin-A seems to be the only way, you just have to get used to it at first. Don&#x27;t waste your money...........</li>
    <li> This product works great, completely fades my sun spots on my face and no irritation I have had with other products.</li>
    <li> I am on my second tube, and not much difference. I am a bit disappointed in this product, and wonder, if someone might know a cream that really works against sun damaged skin and discoloration. This one showed hardly any improvement in my face. I will  not buy a third tube!</li>
    <li> I have used this concentrate for about 2 wks now and I see a visible improvement one of the sunspots on my face. Only 4 out of 5 because not all of them are responding... but maybe they are different spots...??</li>
    <li> This product did ABSOLUTELY nothing that it said it would.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this product to see if it would hold up to my expensive department store brand. I think it works better! It is evening out my complexion and my face feels better. It smells and goes on like a suntan lotion but immediately soaks in and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. My makeup goes on beautifully over the product and stays on for hours. I am sold on the Olay Pro-X products!</li>
    <li> My first time using this product. Maybe it&#x27;s too soon to tell, but after  one tube and only a few weeks, I do notice fading of sun damage!!! And only after about three weeks of application. Promising so far. And oh, the cream is not heavy; it easily disappears and is absorbed into the skin, and spreads around even though the application is like a pen and deposits cream with precision. Worth trying for a few months.</li>
    <li> I do not have sensitive skin, but this made my chest break out in a pretty bad rash.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been fighting discoloration due to melasma since my last kid was born.  I have gone through many tubes of many brands and after using this entire tube I can safely throw it in the \\&quot;didn&#x27;t do a bit of good\\&quot; stack.  They do offer a money back guarantee so don&#x27;t throw your packaging/receipt away if the same holds true for you.  No better than a $5 jar of Palmers.</li>
    <li> When I received the tube of discoloration lotion it seemed almost empty.  I had to shake the contents down to the opening to get any lotion out of it.  I managed to squeeze a little out each day and after 4 weeks I see no difference. The eye products were full and, again I see no difference in my appearance.  Should have stuck to my 2.99 Nivea.  What a waste of 60.00 plus dollars. According to your return policy, I have 30 days to return a product.  Since it takes at least 4-6 weeks to see results, this is a worthless promise.  Joan Fisher</li>
    <li> It arrived very fast and I&#x27;m using it and it only takes a little bit and I think I&#x27;ve seen some improvement,</li>
    <li> This product has performed beyond my expectations. Age spots on  my face are fading fast with twice-daily applications.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a few weeks and was looking to diminish some age spots on my lower jawbone. At this point, I am seeing a little fading. Not saying the product doesn&#x27;t work, I just think I should get through the entire tube before making an assessment.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t remove any dark spots,but made them more visible.First few days it burnt skin later skin turned to red.It didn&#x27;t work.Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 4 months  now on large dark spots at the outter corners of each of my eyes.  I&#x27;m finally seeing the results after using morning and night for over 4 months.  One bottle is all I&#x27;ve gone through and I&#x27;m just ordering a second.  I almost gave up but figured I might as well use it up and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> I have been applying the cream since the end of Oct. and my age spot has lightened a little bit. I am hoping for more results with time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks. It has diminished greatly the spot of discoloration I was most concerned with on my forehead. Another one, less visible on the side of my face, has been less successful but hoping more time passing will help. I have sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with this product bothering my skin-no redness, itchiness, or any kind of irritation.</li>
    <li> I had age spots on both cheeks and one rather large brown patch (melasma) along my hairline on the side of my face.  I also had a few dark spots from adult acne around my chin.  The age spots and the brown patch have substantially lightened in the three weeks I&#x27;ve been using this product.  I will continue to use it until the tube is empty to see if I can get them to fade completely, but I would be totally satisfied with the level of lightening at this point because I&#x27;m probably the only one who really notices them at this point.  I don&#x27;t feel like it worked quite as well on the acne spots, but I&#x27;m still happy with it.  Nice consistency.  No bad smell.  And the price seems reasonable to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my melasma.I have been using it now for around three weeks.My spots are gradually fading.One is almost gone.I use it in the morning under sunscreen-I dab the product on the spots and gently rub it in.Then put sunscreen and my make up over it.It absorbs well,smells delicate-no burning or irritation.It is not an overnight miracle-but it is working.I am also using Sea Buckthorn oil on the spots as well.I use it one day and the cream the next.I believe this combo is really helping.I respect Olay products and have always had good results -this is no exception.Brown spots are a royal pain,and this product is fading them gradually.It only takes a small amount so it is lasting for a while.I would suggest this to others,just have patience and keep applying.You will see a difference within a week or so.If it continues working I believe my spots will be gone in a few months.</li>
    <li> This was just as described and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;When it is gone I will definitely reorder.&lt;br /&gt;It works great for dark skin spots.</li>
    <li> I only used consistently for about 1 1/2 weeks then life got to crazy and I forgot about it.  About a week or 2 later I noticed that half the age spots I had been putting it on were practically gone and the other half that had been very dark were at least 50% faded away! Very surprised and excited about how well it works.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a month and have seen no difference in skin pigmentation.  I feel it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Olay Discoloaration fighting concentrate for 4 weeks and it has done an ok job.  It has faded some marks a little, but does not work as well as the real over the counter products I get from the pharmacy or dermatologist.    If you haven&#x27;t tried anything else before it might work very well, but I was already using Neostrata lightening creams that are half the price ($30 for 15ml), considering Olay costs $70 around here in stores it is really not that worth it.  At least Olay has a money back option for this new line so I&#x27;m not out of my hard earned money.  I do like all the regular Olay products though and have gotten so many compliments on the \\&quot;touch of foundation\\&quot; creams!</li>
    <li> I have sun spots under my eyes and on my  upper lip.  I saw this product from Olay and was hoping it would help make them become less visible.  I used this product as directed everyday for six months and have seen no difference.  I am usually a fan of Olay products but this one just doesn&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s not worth the money and I&#x27;m searching for a new product.</li>
    <li> I have 10 small areas on my face that are brown due to sun damage. They have always bothered me so when I saw this product I thought what the heck. I&#x27;ve been using the cream twice a day for about two weeks now and I can notice some lightening. I do wish the cream worked faster and I really don&#x27;t think my spots will totally go away. I will use the entire bottle before I decide to use another product. For now it looks promising.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some months, and it is a good one to keep the freckles under control.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed morning and night for 3 months for sun damage on my cheeks from sunglasses reflection.  It may have lightened the damage a little bit, but not enough to justify the money I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the discoloration concentrate along with the Pro-X spf 30 lotion for almost three weeks.  I am so happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen thus far.  I&#x27;ve been working on getting rid of sun spots, skin trama and acne scars for over three years with little to no results.  I&#x27;ve tried everything starting with the cheapest products out there to a $50 bottle of the newest dept. store tone correcting lotion.  What a disappointment that splurge was.  I would have had a hard time paying the almost $50 for this too, but saw it on Amazon for about half price.  How could I refuse that?  I sure wasn&#x27;t disappointed and will admit I&#x27;d probably spend full price at the drug store if Amazon doesn&#x27;t continue carrying it for such a bargain.  This is really saying a lot because I&#x27;m a single mom on a budget.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  Most Olay products are great, but this one was not as good as Physicians Formula 6% Skin Bleaching Cream.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my sun spots for 2 months and have not noticed any great change in discolorations.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> What a great addition to the ProX line!  The discoloration fighting cream showed results after just 4 weeks!  My age spots are fading right before my eyes!</li>
    <li> O.k. guys we also have a few \\&quot;age spots\\&quot;. While many of us will never have the skin of a model, why not at least work with what we have in later years, and put forward an little effort to show we still have some pride in our appeareance. Who knows, it may improve you golf game.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Professional Pro-X discoloration fighting concentrate for about 20 days now and I think it&#x27;s working. I was very skeptical about this, but I have this one patch near my eye that was very bad, and it has lightened up. This is using it religiously, following the once day and night protocol. My other freckles are not really lightening up, but I continue using it until the bottle is finished. It does last a while, but I use only a bit at a time for the areas I need. I&#x27;m not sure that it will remove it completely at this rate, but lighter is better than nothing.</li>
    <li> It took about 6 weeks before the spots on the side of my face faded, but they did.  The real test will be in the summer when they tend to darken.  I tried Clinique &amp; did not have the results I have had with Olay.  Give it a try if you have just a few spots.  The tube has lasted approximately 3 months.</li>
    <li> This stuff did fade my two dark spots (the ones that bother me) but they haven&#x27;t gotten rid of them.  I really wanted some sort of cream that would take it down to almost completely not there.. but this is not it.  It does, however, help some.</li>
    <li> With so many products on the market that claim to get rid of brown spots, I cannot believe they are getting rid of one that actually works. My mom has olive skin and sun damage was beginning to show up as very dark patches on her forehead and cheek bone areas.  She tried at least a dozen products and several crazy home remedies too.  When she started using ProX I was not very hopeful but after only a couple weeks, I noticed the spots getting a little less noticeable.  She continued to use the product (use sunscreen too) and the spots are totally gone.  Nothing else worked.  Now they are discontinuing this product.  Maybe Olay has a new product with the same ingredients.  If you see any of this one still for sale, I&#x27;d recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over a year and it has significantly faded several spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate, however, that the folks at Olay seem to have discontinued this specific version and reformulated the product.</li>
    <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t tan well and I get a lot of freckles even when I use SPF 30, also I am pregnant this summer. When after 2 morning visits to the pool I noticed new and darker sun spots on my face, I ran to the store and bought Olay for $36.50 with coupon. Being pregnant left me with limited options - I couldn&#x27;t ask my dermatologist for help until next year.&lt;br /&gt;Olay has helped me tremendously - I have seen the spots faded WITHIN DAYS. I think it has to do with the fact that they were very recent, but my older freckles appear lighter too. These is the inital tingling feeling that goes away and I saw some of my spots became reddish prior to disappearing, it looks like they break into smaller part before compeletely fading. All the darker spots were gone within 10 days. Prior to that I used Lancome tonic and spot treatment and it wasn&#x27;t working well, only more stinging sensation, so switching to Olay was a bargain.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m continuing using it day&amp;night under my moisturizers, until I&#x27;ll ran out.</li>
    <li> My most beautiful wife (59 years old but looks 35 years old) swears by and has used Olay products for years. Olay pro-x is the top of the line. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> I expected better results on lightening/removing brown spots. [[ASIN:B001JQLNNM Olay Discoloration Fighting Concentrate, Pro-x, .4-Ounce Bottle]] is not worth the money. Should have returned it for a refund.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Olay products, but this one didn&#x27;t work???...Don&#x27;t know why, maybe I have to buy another tube...(Don&#x27;t think so)</li>
    <li> The dark spots are disappearing (sun and age) and the tube lasts for months. Buy all of your Olay products from Amazon. You will save sometimes more than 1/2 price!   When you use this just barely put a dab on the spot that you want to treat, it is easy to put to much. Just rub it in and Viola, watch them disappear.</li>
    <li> Been using for over 6 weeks no difference noticed on age spots, very little product and high priced not worth it</li>
    <li> I am only 30 and hoped this would help me get rid of the minor acne marks I have leftover, but I never saw a difference. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product because of the reviews I had previously read.  In my opinion, it was a waste of money and I have seen no improvements.</li>
    <li> WORKS ABOUT LIKE OTHERS FOR SALE.  HAVE YET TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND THAT YOU CAN AFFORD SO WILL PROBABLY NOT REORDER</li>
    <li> Well, it did what it said it would do - it got rid of discoloration.  I got burned on my face when submitting myself to laser hair removal.  The result of the hair removal burn left me with dark pigmentation spots all over my face.  I tried this olay product for the first time for about a week, putting it on twice a day (once in the morning and once at night).   Now, as a side note, my face is otherwise blemish free and I have no other skin problems.  I can leave makeup on my face overnight without recourse, and I am not allergic to any products.  So I figured my face would hold up well to such a quality brand as Olay......  The first couple of days were fine.  However, by the end of the first week, I had 50+ small bumps all over my face and it seemed that the Olay product was eating away at my skin.  I was beyond mortified, as it was something that I could not just hide with concealer/makeup like I could with just the dark pigmentation.  I stopped using this Olay product after that first week.  However, once the bumps went away and my skin healed, I noticed that the dark pigmentation was gone!  Am I happy with the overall result, yes.  Did I like the &#x27;process&#x27; leading up to it - definitely not.    It is definitely something you have to take into consideration.</li>
    <li> I have been using all the Olay Pro-X products and find them to do what they claim.  I am not quite so sure about this product.  I have been using it faithfully twice a day for about three weeks and I don&#x27;t really see any change in the brown spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it as it might take a while longer. So my rating would be a \\&quot;wait and see\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for at least a month and have not seen any improvement.  Well be going to the doctor and obtaining a prescription drug and hope it works.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This really worked for me -- I&#x27;m still in awe.  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on the market to get rid of this one little brown spot on my face.  Nothing worked.  I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot -- used it for 2 week, twice a day faithfully.  I put on more than was required, but that&#x27;s just me!  Anyway, took my make up off and was applying my cream and grabbed this...looked in the mirror and had a hard time finding the spot!!!  Seriously -- it worked for me!  I&#x27;m so happy the spot from hell is gone.  I will recommend this to all my friends.  I like a few products by Olay, but am normally not a fan due to the scents of their products -- even the cleansing cloths make me sneeze.  I&#x27;ve no problem with this.  Try it.  It really worked for me.</li>
    <li> I put this product on 3 itsy bitsy spots on my upper cheeks, and within 15 minutes both of my cheeks, part of my nose and chin turned bright red and started burning.  I washed it off as soon as I could, and that didn&#x27;t help any. Never had this problem before with any facial products. OUCH!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price. The entire line of Olay Pro X is excellent. I tried all the expensive brands like Dr Perricone and many others in the $300+ range, but came back to Olay Pro X. It works better. Besides having good results from Pro X, my favorite thing about the product line is that there is absolutely no fragrance. Even when a product says, &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no scent; it just means they haven&#x27;t added a scent. Sometimes it has a natural scent that&#x27;s offensive to many of us who are sensitive. If you have an issue with scents, try Olay. You&#x27;ll be very happy you did.</li>
    <li> prompt delivery. and i use this twice daily. small bottle but it goes a long way bc you dont have to use much. ive had a couple weeks and already see a difference:)</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any significant lightening of the sun spots after a little over a month, though I will continue to use the product and give it some more time.</li>
    <li> I have used the Olay discoloration fighting concentrate for a month.  I have tried for several years to get rid of 2 brown splotches on the one side of my face using different creams but to no avail.  The brown splotches have faded significantly to where I can barely see them so this product has worked great for me.  With another week or two they should be gone forever and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> It seems to work - that sort of sums it up.&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight improvment - perhaps I were expecting too much ?</li>
    <li> I have tried a few other products for discoloration on my face...and this was the only one that has actually reduced it....It&#x27;s not yet gone but it&#x27;s a lot lighter....I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see what happens...but I do recommend this.</li>
    <li> The results are slower than advertised.  However, I do see a difference with consistent use.  A thin application is necessary in order to use foundation over it.  The product is light and non-irratating .</li>
    <li> I bought this rather expensive product in hopes of lightening some dark sun spots I have on my face.  I used it religiously twice a day for a good 4 months (never missed an application).  Unfortunately it was as if I had only been using water as there was not even the smallest difference after all that time.  I have used products containing HQ (a large jar comes at a fraction of the price of this small tube) and while it did not produce the results I was looking for it at least made some difference.  I thought trying something new from a reputable brand at a much higher price point may yield better results.  Didn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin is different and your experience my vary; however, based on my long-term attempt though I have to say that this was money down the drain.</li>
    <li> I hate getting old and age spots is one of the reasons. I have used this product consistently and there is a consistant improvement on both sides of my face. I will continue to order at Amazon where I&#x27;ve found the lowest price and free shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this product and Olay decided to stop making it.  So I just keep finding it on line in bunches!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all! Sent back for refund.</li>
    <li> I have had two brown spots for 30 years and decided to try this because of the cheap price before I spend more money on other items.  I used it twice a day for a week now and my two spots have faded significantly.  When I put powder on, you can nearly see them.  My skin does  itch a little where I apply the cream, but it goes away after a while.  I only plan to use this one more week and save the rest for any future spots that may show up.  Be sure to use a moisturizing cream after use as you skin get very dry.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  The price was much better than any store  offers.  It arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> After having used for 4 weeks, my friend compliments my face look clearer.I am considering to purchase another one.Thank you.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price, not enough product!</li>
    <li> I am about half way through the tube and the spot I am concentrating on is visibly lighter.  I follow the directions and and diligent about using it night and day.</li>
    <li> Very goood for your skin, as you age.</li>
    <li> I am just about finished with my first tube of this product, and frankly, I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes at all.</li>
</ol>
