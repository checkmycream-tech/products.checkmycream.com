      <li>My skin feels much softer.</li>
      <li>I simply wipe it off and rinse lightly so my skin gets the benefit all night.</li>

      <li>I would say that people with sensitive skin should use it more carefully .</li>

      <li>I expect that I will have complete healing of my skin in no time.</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t use it directly on your skin .</li>
      <li>makes my skin really soft.</li>
      <li>Much, much cheaper than buying oils individually.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! Great blend of oils, high quality. Much, much cheaper than buying oils individually. I use this to make my own face wipes (Neutrogena style).  Google instructions if you want to make your own, its cheap and easy.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil, which I use in all of my home made skin care products. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and hope to always have it available.</li>
    <li> Plant therapy is my new favorite! I&#x27;m an esthetician and have been trying to incorporate more natural skincare to my treatments. This blend has most of the eo&#x27;s I wanted to try separately, and the smell is nice. One drop in a carrier oil is all I use, and it does the trick. Only been using for a week so I can&#x27;t speak for results yet, but it&#x27;s definitely a quality blend which I&#x27;ve come to expect from plant therapy. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping, great product use it every day . Strong smell but seems to work great</li>
    <li> Really lives up to its name!</li>
    <li> I put just a few drops in jojoba oil and rub on my skin after a shower. It smells wonderful and still smells fragrant after several hours. I could not blend a better oil for my skin - highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good value compared to buying the oils separately, but the cons of a blend is that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You don&#x27;t know the percentage of each oil in the blend (Frankincense and Neroli, which are very expensive, for example, are probably present in very low concentration) and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) You don&#x27;t chose the individual oils, or the proportion in your final formula. For oils such as fennel that stimulate estrogen production and is not indicated in case of breast cancer and other kinds of tumor, epilepsy and hypothyroidism, that may be an issue.</li>
    <li> This is a great blend of oils and smells great.  I mix it with aveeno and coconut oil for an after shower moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT!!! If you are looking for something to help your skin - look no further!!! I haven&#x27;t even been using it that long, but noticed a difference almost immediately in the feeling of my skin! The blend in it ... is GREAT for the skin and the carrot seed oil is a natural SPF! So you are getting added protection while having gorgeous skin! My pores are getting smaller too! I just use it AM and PM in my fave moisturizer! It&#x27;s super easy!!!</li>
    <li> the products, essential oils, are of exceptional quality and at a good price.  I used in skin with really no carrier and in water.  good flavor and smell, feel the quality is great.  Now if they can offer larger bottles!!</li>
    <li> Been using this in my homemade face wash.  Love it!  Thank you</li>
    <li> Purchased this in hopes of using in tandem with the Acne Fighter oil; however, the smell is very off-putting which means I can&#x27;t use it on my face.  I&#x27;ve mixed it with almond oil and used on legs after shaving.  I didn&#x27;t notice it being any more effective than my regular lotion.</li>
    <li> it did not help my wrinkles and burned a little on my face</li>
    <li> While I like the ingredients, the smell is quite off-putting.  I prefer Eden&#x27;s Garden oils over this brand.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. The smell is wonderful and can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> This oil blend mixed with 50/50 of sesame and sweet almond oil makes my skin really soft. The smell is a bit overpowering so use lightly. I mix 4 ounces each of my carrier oils and approx. 20-30 drops of this for an all over skin moisturizer that I use at bedtime. I don&#x27;t mind the scent but it could be off putting to some. To me it smells very woodsy.</li>
    <li> This product reached me on time and in perfect condition. It is a very strong oil so don&#x27;t use it directly on your skin . It definitely needs to be added to a carrier oil before you apply . It will work better for people who have oily or combination skin . For people who have dry skin it might leave you  looking for more moisturizer . I would say that people with sensitive skin should use it more carefully . All in all it&#x27;s a great product if it suits your skin .</li>
    <li> This is a great blend of oils. It&#x27;s calming and rejuvenating. I have used it in liquid hand soap, and the scent really carries well. I would definitely recommend for this for use in body products.</li>
    <li> I use this in a base of coconut oil as my evening cleanser/makeup remover. I simply wipe it off and rinse lightly so my skin gets the benefit all night.</li>
    <li> I added this to a basic shea along with cocoa absolute, and I am very pleased. I had laser dermabrasion several years ago which left me looking like I had a permanent sunburn. Within 2 weeks, between the two products I saw a 70% healing of the damage and a complete healing of sun damage. I expect that I will have complete healing of my skin in no time. It it long-lasting and I don&#x27;t even need to wear makeup anymore! My mother loves it so much that she is &amp;#34;selling&amp;#34; it to all her friends. And she had just bout 3 jars of another product (that she is not even using!).</li>
    <li> This oil is pure magic if you&#x27;re looking for soft skin.  The smell is a bit strong (I like it, but it took some getting used to) and my skin hasn&#x27;t quite adjusted yet, but overall it&#x27;s a great product.  The winters in Utah are extremely dry and this oil does a good job of counteracting the irritation and dryness caused by the dry air.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I mix one drop with a finger tip amount of shea butter for a moisterizer. My adult acne is actually clearing up and my face is so soft!</li>
    <li> After just two days of use I can tell a difference in my skin. The oil blend has a lovely fragrance, not too strong. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this!  This is my third order.  I mix it inavacado, grape seed oil and argon oil.  It soaks in very nicely.</li>
    <li> I got this couple of weeks ago. As always very promote shipment.  I have used this product for a week or two now.  I can&#x27;t complain much about it. Its is ok. My face is very sensitive and has acne so it could be my face. But it does make my face soft.</li>
    <li> I have only had this about a week and Love it!!  I mix a drop with a little jojoba oil after shower and put on my face and though I dislike the smell of lavender, it fades pretty quick. I&#x27;ve noticed clearer, softer skin and the lines around my eyes are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> It has the main eo&#x27;s that I was looking for to make a serum for my skin: frankincense, carrot, lavender, and rose.  I make up a bottle with several carrier oils (camellia, jojoba, rosehip, and tamanu, and then add several drops of the Soft Skin, and really like it. The scent is nice and the shipment was quick.</li>
    <li> I combined this with coconut oil and use it daily as a makeup remover and moisturizer.  My skin feels much softer. The only negative I have  us I don&#x27;t care for the smell too much.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to using essential oils.  I wanted to try them on my face but I didn&#x27;t want to buy a bunch of different oils in case I had any issues with them.  This product was an affordable mix of everything I wanted.  I just add 3 - 4 drops with my regular moisturizer.  My skin feels and looks great! I have had several comments on how good it looks.  Looking forward to continued improvement in the softness and clarity.  I am over 50 by the way.</li>
    <li> This is a nice blend for aging skin and the value is really there when compared to price of buying each oil. This combination has all the essential oils a guide for making your own cosmetic products recommended for aging skincare and this synergy saved me a lot of time and money in that I did not have to buy all these separate.  I make my own face cream and I use this blend with pure organic Shea butter for night time skin cream.</li>
