      <li>sure how it works</li>

      <li>Many uses.</li>
      <li>It smells &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; for lack of a better term, but the scent is not offensive and doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I prefer a body wash without dyes and fragrances, most of which seem to irritate me in one form or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cannot say enough good things about this product!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because this is also scent free, I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t see it in the picture, this is a pump top</li>

      <li>There are definitely better options for your baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>EUCERIN BABY CLEANSING RELIEF BODY WASH is okay.</li>
      <li>and I found that I did have to use more than I thought.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic product!</li>
      <li>I bought this for my grand child, when he visits.  </li>
      <li>I find it interesting that it has Sea Salt and Citric Acid..</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>She plans on buying more of this product.  </li>
      <li>Clean power is very good, use a sponge with the soap, works very well.</li>
      <li>Lathers up nicely, rinses cleanly and leaves you feeling refreshed.</li>
      <li>price is very reasonable, and the Eucerin Wash does a good job cleansing.</li>
      <li>This is a nice mild body wash for babies as well as adults who suffer from skin problems.</li>
      <li>I love everything about this body wash except the smell which I thought would be more like a baby lotion or powder until I realized it was scent free.</li>
      <li>Using Amazon reviews I found a non-steroid lotion that has done a great job of taming the eczema, but I am not supposed to wash my face with hot water or even very warm water or regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>were so much easier to clean and felt great, too.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall a fantastic deal on our favorite cleanser.  </li>
      <li>This is great for anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It is a good, gentle cleanser that can be used on both babies and adults.  </li>
      <li>This body wash is so gentle I loved using it.  </li>
      <li>This is truly good for the whole family.</li>
      <li>shape of the bottle makes it easy to grip with wet hands and the pump is of excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Eucerin Baby Cleansing Relief Body Wash is free of dyes and perfumes so it would be great for a baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This is a very mild and calming wash.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not so strong that it strips all of your skin&#x27;s oils away.  </li>
      <li>Also, Tammy doesn’t use hygiene products that smell like strong perfume because of her allergies.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s softening, cleansing, and smells fine.</li>
      <li>Says it has no dyes and fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>and Eucerin was a fantastic change!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The wash foams up nice and gentle and rinses off well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess if you want chemical free you can&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
      <li>product is free of fragrances and dyes, and states it has no soap.</li>
      <li>So far so good ...</li>
      <li>Love how gentle this is on her skin!</li>
      <li>Eucerin has been a huge help for all of them at providing quick relief.  </li>
      <li>It did an effective job of removing both dirt and debris, kept my skin soft and free of any redness, a produced a moisture layer without irritation or itching.&lt;br</li>
      <li>He uses it as a body wash and shampoo and it gets him clean.  </li>
      <li>It cleans nicely, and seems to rinse completely.  </li>
      <li>used this product with luke warm water and a soft wash cloth.</li>
      <li>This is the most mild gentle body wash I have ever used.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what we prefer, but if you want something even mildly scented, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If the eczema is mild or severe, the product doesn&#x27;t do much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I thought I would try no perfume soaps, mild temperatures and shorter showers.  </li>
      <li>Mild and lathers well.</li>
      <li>The bottle is pretty big and with the pump top, it makes dispensing very easy.</li>
      <li>My skin has become very sensitive and I&#x27;ve had to stop using most products with fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Definitely, no perfume of any kind is noticeable with the Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
      <li>Bottle lasts a lot so worth the price.</li>
      <li>in fact, I have a standing Rx for the Eucerin cream mixed with cortisone that it&#x27;s highly effective.  </li>
      <li>There is minimal lathering, which is good, as I understand it.  </li>
      <li>It is clear, and does not have any particular smell to it, but it does produce a nice, rich lather, and cleans very well.</li>
      <li>My son is very fair skinned and seems to be a little sensitive as well.</li>
      <li>My thought is that she&#x27;s not as fastidious about rinsing as she used to be and while it certainly should be rinsed, the residual of a formulation for babies is be easier on her skin - but as a bonus, it seems to wash off way better than soap - even with her soft water.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product for those with sensitive skin, including babies (although I hardly fall into that</li>
      <li>It has no scent, does not suds up much because it is so mild.</li>
      <li>Its is mild and gentle for the skin.</li>
      <li>I had one that was thicker, but it seemed to really agitate the drier skin in more sensitive areas...</li>
      <li>Makes my own skin dry</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is an excellent product for those with sensitive skin, including babies (although I hardly fall into that category).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have problem skin that is often subject to sensitivity issues and I prefer a body wash without dyes and fragrances, most of which seem to irritate me in one form or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No dyes or perfumes here and it&#x27;s not so strong that it strips all of your skin&#x27;s oils away.  In addition, it appears concentrated enough that one or two squirts in a body sponge will do the trick.  This bottle should last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef is with the bottle design.  If you can&#x27;t see it in the picture, this is a pump top and I found that attempting to pump while in a shower usually meant the bottom would slip out from under you if you had it on any hard surface (holding it in one hand didn&#x27;t help any because of its bulk).</li>
    <li> Easily dispensable, this baby cleansing body wash is a nice alternative to more expensive brands.  My grandson has excema and we use Eucerin body lotion on him so we thought this wash would be a good companion.  The wash foams up nice and gentle and rinses off well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use Aveeno products on him as well and I am a bit lost however to where the oatmeal is in the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this for my grandson because he didn&#x27;t come out of the tub red skinned (even the Aveeno left him with red splotches).</li>
    <li> Ingredients: water, decyl glucoside, sodium myreth sulfate, PEG-200 hydrogenated glyceryl palmate, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium chloride, panthenol, sodium benzoate, citric acid, sea salt, bisabolol, polyquarternium-10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes on ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;*Decyl glucoside and cocamidopropyl betaine are both derived from coconut. The &amp;#34;glucoside&amp;#34; aspect of the decyl glucoside is derived from corn starch.&lt;br /&gt;***sodium myreth sulfate - similar to sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate, so if you or baby has allergies to either of the later, do a test run***&lt;br /&gt;*PEG-200 hydrogenated glycerly palmate is derivative of hydrogenated palm glyceride&lt;br /&gt;*sodium chloride: table salt...helps make the gel &amp;#34;viscous&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;*panthenol: vitamin B5...basically there to moisturize the skin&lt;br /&gt;*sodium benzoate: preservative (often used in food)&lt;br /&gt;*citric acid: exfoliant, astringent and preservative&lt;br /&gt;*sea salt: can contain a variety of minerals that are good for the skin&lt;br /&gt;*bisabolol: water soluble oil oil derived from German chamomile, has anti-inflammatory properties&lt;br /&gt;*polyquarternium-10: derivative of hydroxyethyl cellulose used as a thickener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: other than the ingredients, none. It smells &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; for lack of a better term, but the scent is not offensive and doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: This is very thick, so start with a little because it will go a long way.</li>
    <li> Many people who have psoriasis, eczema, or other problems such as sensitive or dry skin, or who are otherwise concerned about the chemicals they put in and on their bodies, use personal care products marketed for infants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body wash is one of the mildest cleansers that I have used.  It makes almost no lather, but cleans well.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive areas or leave the skin feeling stripped or dry.  It is naturally clear and has only the faint smell of coconuts from which some of the ingredients are derived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the bottle makes it easy to grip with wet hands and the pump is of excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Water, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Myreth Sulfate, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Panthenol, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Sea Salt, Bisabolol, Polyquaternium-10.</li>
    <li> I got this for my elderly mom to try.  She&#x27;s always had beautiful skin, but in the last few years, it&#x27;s been dry and sensitive - particularly during the winter months.  She didn&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell, and I thought it both lathered and rinsed well.  My thought is that she&#x27;s not as fastidious about rinsing as she used to be and while it certainly should be rinsed, the residual of a formulation for babies is be easier on her skin - but as a bonus, it seems to wash off way better than soap - even with her soft water.</li>
    <li> I suffer from severely dry skin from the neck down. As soon as the mercury drops, my skin starts to itch and the texture resembles that of a lizard. I&#x27;ve learned over the years that less is more when it comes to caring for my skin-perfumes, harsh ingredients, etc.-they are only going to harm and not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, when this came up in my Vine List, I decided to try it. I am glad I did because it works. Like the description says, it is free of perfumes, irritating additives, etc. It does the job, and I have even been able to use it on my face. Plus, the large size is great for those who don&#x27;t want to pay a ton for a body wash. (And, really, who does?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying this once my freebie runs out. I&#x27;ve also used this on my kids. This is truly good for the whole family.</li>
    <li> Tammy, my girlfriend, is not a baby; however, she loves it when I call her one.  She suffers from Eczema--very dry skin.  One night, while she and I were watching a Blu-ray, she kept scratching her legs nonstop; I thought she’d been attacked by mosquitoes, even though outside temperatures have been in the thirties and forties.  She told me her Eczema was bothering her, especially on her legs.  Eczema can be very painful, even debilitating, depending upon its severity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  When the Amazon Vine Program offered me the Eucerin Baby Cleansing Relief Body Wash, I grabbed it.  Babies can’t talk but Tammy can.  She told me that the Eucerin Body Wash provided a lot of comfort and didn’t leave her skin dry like some of the soaps she has used in the past.  Also, Tammy doesn’t use hygiene products that smell like strong perfume because of her allergies.  The Eucerin Body Wash didn’t clog her sinuses or make her sneeze nonstop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Whether you or a baby or an adult, I highly recommend the Eucerin Baby Cleansing Relief Body Wash.  It relieves and heals Eczema.  Tammy has used other Eucerin products; this, however, is the first time for the body wash.  She plans on buying more of this product.  I guess I know what to put in her stocking this Christmas--a hygiene product from which she can actually benefit.  At least it won’t add pounds to her hips like chocolate.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have super sensitive skin.  This soap-free cleanser is great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;- Value.  Goes a long way.  Only takes a little bit, and this is a pretty large container.&lt;br /&gt;- Many uses. Not just for babies.  This works like a sensitive-skin shower jel, facial cleanser, and baby wash.&lt;br /&gt;- Fragrance and dye free.&lt;br /&gt;- Not as watery as other brands we&#x27;ve used.  Actually get a little lather out of this, unlike some soap-free cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;- Pump dispenser is very convenient and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a fantastic deal on our favorite cleanser.  HIghly recommended for babies and adults as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Eucerin lotion before, but this is my first time trying a cleanser.  It is a good, gentle cleanser that can be used on both babies and adults.  It has a gentle lather--not super-sudsy, but enough to make a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucerin Baby is dye-free and fragrance-free, something I look for in a wash both for me and baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as skin healing and moisturizing, I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference between this and what I&#x27;ve used previously, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for natural, keep looking because this does contain chemicals.  Here are the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Myreth Sulfate, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Panthenol, Sodium Benzoate, Citiric Acid, Sea Salt, Bisabolol, Polyquaternium-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is very reasonable, and the Eucerin Wash does a good job cleansing.</li>
    <li> We tried this and our adult daughter used it as she is prone to moderate to sever eczema and is always looking for a product that provides some relief. So, we can&#x27;t say how this would be for babies but we can comments about adult use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, there is really no added fragrance or smell; it&#x27;s neutral. That&#x27;s what we prefer, but if you want something even mildly scented, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all felt it cleanses well and is also comfort-neutral in that it doesn&#x27;t irritate in any way, but it doesn&#x27;t give any feeling of &amp;#34;well being&amp;#34; or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key point: what does it do for eczema? Our daughter reports that if the eczema is still mild, this body wash helps a little. It&#x27;s nothing like complete relief, but it does help. If the eczema is mild or severe, the product doesn&#x27;t do much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the bottom line is four stars. The product is good enough; it works as a neutral body wash, and it can give partial relief to mild eczema. I can&#x27;t go five stars, though, as it just isn&#x27;t anything extra special.</li>
    <li> We use this on our eczema-prone infant for head-to-toe bathes and find it to be very gentle and helpful in keeping his skin clear.</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough good things about this product!! Works wonders on my baby&#x27;s skin and I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and already my sons skin has improved!!</li>
    <li> Our daughter has so many skin issues. Love how gentle this is on her skin!</li>
    <li> We love this product due to baby&#x27;s sensitive skin. 1 bottle goes a long way. 6+ months depending on how often you bathe baby</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It&#x27;s arrive on time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Mild and lathers well. My 4mth old son has been using this for over 5 weeks now and it doesn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t bother his eyes. Such a big bottle should last a long way. Will repurchase in a few months!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Buy the cream to go with!!! These two items together are pure bliss..</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that this provided any benefit to our baby&#x27;s eczema-prone skin. It has sulfates which give that artificial bubbling and the ingredients are not that great. The texture feels pretty typical of a body wash. There are definitely better options for your baby&#x27;s skin. I personally recommend the Berry Shiny Hair and Body Wash by Little Roseberry as an alternative to this product.</li>
    <li> My kid has dry skin, so I&#x27;ve tried many different products until I discover this one. I don&#x27;t use anything else. You need only a Little bit , so a bottle lasts forever.</li>
    <li> very gentle and does not dry out your skin</li>
    <li> Only soap I can use on my daughter who has severe eczema. I use it as her body wash &amp; shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is a very mild and calming wash.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Relieved my toddler&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grand child, when he visits.  So far so good ... what else can I say?  This is just as I expected.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this body wash except the smell which I thought would be more like a baby lotion or powder until I realized it was scent free. It smelled almost like nothing but it did have a slight smell which I can&#x27;t describe well but did not love. The smell is not a deal breaker though as I loved the texture and lather this bath wash had. It left me skin clean but not overly dry and it lathered so well. I have to also say I love the pump on the bottle and the nice design of the bottle. It seems like a good value for the money and it does it&#x27;s job well. I used it on my son as well and he did not complain about the smell or it stinging his eyes. This is a great wash I recommend, but I am a little disappointed is the odor of it. I guess if you want chemical free you can&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
    <li> I have wretched skin in the winter.  It hurts it is so dry.  I have tried per my dermatologist to get out of the shower and while still wet put on baby oil on the skin to preserve moisture.  This helps, but it is not perfect.  In the shower the water actually hurts my skin.  So I thought I would try no perfume soaps, mild temperatures and shorter showers.  But I like this one.  I had one that was thicker, but it seemed to really agitate the drier skin in more sensitive areas...correction, it felt good going on, but after I got out of the shower, yucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is not too water, and not too thick.  There is minimal lathering, which is good, as I understand it.  It cleans nicely, and seems to rinse completely.  This soap and the baby oil on moist skin has been keeping down the scaley skin and pain when my clothes touch my skin...clothes are fairly necessary.  So it is nicer when my clothes don&#x27;t make my skin hurt.</li>
    <li> Very good for my super alergic daughter. Bottle lasts a lot so worth the price.</li>
    <li> Living in the desert, where most of the year the humidity is as low as single digit, my skin of course gets dry and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Eucerin Baby Cleansing Relief Body Wash in the hopes it would relieve the dry itching. I found the product to be gentle yet effective with cleansing, and did not leave my skin as dry as other body washes. It did not moisturize as much as I&#x27;d like, but then it doesn&#x27;t claim to be a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is free of fragrances and dyes, and states it has no soap. It is clear, and does not have any particular smell to it, but it does produce a nice, rich lather, and cleans very well. It also rinses completely without leaving you skin sticky or overly dried out. I use it for my 5 year old grandson, and it easily gets him clean even when he&#x27;s been doing heavy duty playing in the dirt. I often put 1 or 2 squirts into the water while filling the bathtub, and it results in a nice bubble bath.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that I switch to a simple baby cleanser. He recommended not to use Johnson and Johnson, so now I use this scrub, love it and have the subscribe and save :)</li>
    <li> My son had a couple reactions to other baby washes in his first few months, and our pediatrician recommended we try this product. We&#x27;ve been using it for over 9 months now and we&#x27;re still happy with it.</li>
    <li> Me and my two years old son both use it for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Not just for babies.  This is great for anyone with sensitive skin.  Very gentle.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. It&#x27;s like I went from oily blemish prone skin to dry skin over-night.  The joys of getting older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It used to be a dry skin problem during the winter, which makes sense because you have the dry biting, frigid wind, and you have the moisture sucking inside heat.  Now however I&#x27;m finding that my skin gets uncomfortably dry during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so began the search for the perfect body wash... made complicated by my allergies and sensitivity to some scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This EUCERIN BABY CLEANSING RELIEF BODY WASH is okay. It has no scent but that of the ingredients. It&#x27;s a rather neutral scent. The wash suds sufficiently so you can tell where it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the Wash to be very gentle, but if your skin is already chapped it won&#x27;t improve that condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently had an outbreak of facial eczema around my eyelids and ears. Using Amazon reviews I found a non-steroid lotion that has done a great job of taming the eczema, but I am not supposed to wash my face with hot water or even very warm water or regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t much like the idea of not washing up thoroughly and plain water was not doing much on the skin that has become to flake up since the debris wasn&#x27;t actually being removed.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product with luke warm water and a soft wash cloth. It did an effective job of removing both dirt and debris, kept my skin soft and free of any redness, a produced a moisture layer without irritation or itching.&lt;br /&gt;Because this is also scent free, I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Not certain how a baby&#x27;s skin is going to react to this wash, but my skin was quite irritated and is clear of redness and the other overt signs of eczema.</li>
    <li> Love this. Gentle but cleans well. I use this on my face as a regular cleanser and with my infant and toddler.</li>
    <li> This is a gentle body wash. The lather produced is not much (it is for a baby) and it is gentle on the skin. The smell is eh, bland and neutral. It smells like its ingredients. I don&#x27;t really like this smell at all. I tried the body wash on myself first and did not find it drying. No redness or allergic reactions. I wouldn&#x27;t get this again though. i don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
    <li> The first thing I examined were the ingredients in this body wash for babies and adults.  Few purchasers of this product will be able to evaluate this complicated list of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Myreth Sulfate, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Panthenol, Sodium Benzoate, Citiric Acid, Sea Salt, Bisabolol, Polyquaternium-10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We must take on faith that the chemists at Eucerin have evaluated carefully each item included in this product.  Eucerin does have a good name and has been recommended to me by my dermatoligist.  That&#x27;s a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer commented on the smell of the product and thought it was both \\&quot;nasty\\&quot; and \\&quot;medicinal.\\&quot;  I asked my wife, who has an excellent sense of smell, to test this body wash and pay particular attention to the smell.  I watched as she first put warm water on her face and hands and then dispensed a small amout of the body wash into her hands, rubbed them together to develop a lather, and then washed her face.  She thought that the Eucerin had the smell of the plastic bottle that contains the product.  Otherwise, she thought the Eucerin had very little smell and it was not objectionable to her.  When I used this product at bath time, I also paid particular attention to the smell and agree with my wife.  Definitely, no perfume of any kind is noticeable with the Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are all different and each of us, including babies, will have a different response to this body wash.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not find it drying.  Instead, I thought it left my skin feeling clean and refreshed.  I used this product in the shower, but babies will be given a bath and the makers recommend that the bath take no longer than five minutes, which suggests to me that leaving this product on the skin for any length of time is not a good idea.  Additionally, the makers of this product warn about getting the body wash in the eyes.  Most of us are careful about not getting any soap in our eyes and must be especially carefull with small children not to irritate their eyes with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend that adults give this body wash a try; I am not sure how babies sensitive skin will respond to this product.y soap in our eyes and must be especially carefull with small children not to irritate their eyes with this product.    I can recommend that adults give this body wash a try; I am not sure how babies sensitive skin will respond to this product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mild body wash for babies as well as adults who suffer from skin problems. Even if you don&#x27;t, this is a nice body wash to use.&lt;br /&gt;It has little to no scent, clear and lathers very well.  The bottle is pretty big and with the pump top, it makes dispensing very easy. I really like this!</li>
    <li> This body wash lotion really helped my oily skin. Plus it helps against painful areas where lesions develop, so I think it&#x27;s one of those household items that&#x27;s always good to have around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of skin conditions that are eczema get misinterpreted as food allergies, and when that happens one would never know that a lotion like this will help treat the problem. Also, it rinses off nicely without leaving any bothersome residue and smells pleasant.</li>
    <li> All of our children get mild cases of eczema or just badly dried skin especially in the winter time.  Eucerin has been a huge help for all of them at providing quick relief.  The kids use this body wash at bath time, and it works great.  HIGHLY recommended.</li>
    <li> I am not a baby but my skin gets dry easily and I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t strip my skin but  I would feel my skin was clean.&lt;br /&gt;While I still do use Dove  I always felt my skin could be cleaner and Eucerin was a fantastic change!&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how it works but it comes out in a pump in a watery gel.  It does not foam up and I found that I did have to use more than I thought.  However, when I rubbed it gently on my skin it sort of seem to just rub off. the debri but I didn&#x27;t feel anything abrasive.  I liked how it felt and because it seemed to dissolve the debri on my skin, hard to reach places like between my toes were so much easier to clean and felt great, too.  I also loved that I could wash my face and my eyes hardly felt any irritation at all.  I am super sensitive and even faint perfumes can set me off.  This body wash is so gentle I loved using it.  I only wish I didn&#x27;t have to use so much at a time!</li>
    <li> Eucerin Baby Cleansing Relief Body Wash is free of dyes and perfumes so it would be great for a baby&#x27;s sensitive skin. It is also is great for us adults. Lathers up nicely, rinses cleanly and leaves you feeling refreshed. Perfect for those with sensitive skin. 5/5 stars!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my toddler&#x27;s eyes.I don&#x27;t feel that it makes their skin particularly moist but it is definitely clean.</li>
    <li> This cleanser was great for babies.</li>
    <li> Sensitive skin relief.</li>
    <li> Makes my own skin dry</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Love using it!</li>
    <li> Its is mild and gentle for the skin. It is a good soap.</li>
    <li> If its good enough for a baby, its good enough for my delicate skin. I have sensitive skin, and finding a good soap that does not dry a person skin or irritate it has gotten tough. Clean power is very good, use a sponge with the soap, works very well.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and gentle on my skin!!!</li>
    <li> My son is very fair skinned and seems to be a little sensitive as well. I really like this body wash. Despite being Eucerin it lathers well. It doesn&#x27;t seem to ever bother his eyes and doesn&#x27;t make him break out.</li>
    <li> Perfect body wash for people with sensitive skin. I have not used it on a baby, even though it says its a baby wash.  I use it on myself. It has no scent, does not suds up much because it is so mild. I have very sensitive skin and cannot tolerate soaps with scent or other detergent like ingredients. This is the most mild gentle body wash I have ever used. it is gentle enough for all body parts. The only thing I can see that someone may not like is that it does not make a lot of suds. But this does not bother me because I feel that the low suds is because it is so gentle. I would highly recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin, allergies or also on babies. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> My son has very sensitive skin and he is prone to eczema.  Although it&#x27;s gotten better as he has gotten older (he is seven now), every time I switch to a regular type of soap we have problems with dryness, itchy rashes, and eczema outbreaks.  I&#x27;ve used other Eucerin products - in fact, I have a standing Rx for the Eucerin cream mixed with cortisone that it&#x27;s highly effective.  I was excited to try this product as I have been looking for a good all in one soap for him to use in the shower.  It has worked well - as other Eucerin products do - very mild, no scent, no irritation, no dryness.  He uses it as a body wash and shampoo and it gets him clean.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My skin has become very sensitive and I&#x27;ve had to stop using most products with fragrance.  Although this body wash is unscented, it has a pleasant light soapy smell that I love.  It is gentle on my skin and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I am using this body wash myself, not on a baby. Its not as sudsy as big people body wash but its sudsy enough and whatever ingredient makes more suds is probably bad for us anyway. I detect no added fragrence, it just smells like what its made of. My skin definitely feels soft after showering with this product. Soft but not like anything remains on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this baby body wash. It&#x27;s softening, cleansing, and smells fine. Eucerin is a great brand.</li>
    <li> I use this for myself not for baby, and I don&#x27;t believe I have eczema.  I have super dry skin and alot of sun damage from years of tanning bed  and natural sunning.  I probably don&#x27;t drink enough water and aging skin contributes to the problem.  This stuff cleans without drying out your skin..has no soap in it.  Says it has no dyes and fragrance free.  I find it interesting that it has Sea Salt and Citric Acid..no wonder it says don&#x27;t get in eyes, external use only!  I don&#x27;t know what Panthenol is, but supposed to nourish skin and this is for babies and pediatrician recommended.  I just know it feels good after your shower and you don&#x27;t have the dry itchy skin.  I also use the eucerin cream and like it too</li>
    <li> My babies have such sensitive skin. This product works really well. A+</li>
