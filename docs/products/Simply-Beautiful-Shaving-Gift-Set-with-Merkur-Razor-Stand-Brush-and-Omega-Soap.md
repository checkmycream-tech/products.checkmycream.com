      <li>Everything is great.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re buying the item for yourself and you don&#x27;t mind waiting it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>It was a great deal for a beginner.</li>
      <li>Great as a gift for someone wanting to stray from the plastic razors.</li>
      <li>I have an Edwin Jagger DE 89, which is a great razor by the way...</li>

      <li>I use it a lot and it still stays in the great condition it came in.</li>
      <li>It was a great idea, but didn&#x27;t quite hit the mark.</li>
      <li>, how great the brush was, how he was turned on to the Merkur razor etc.</li>
      <li>In all, a great product.</li>

      <li>brush is very nice</li>
      <li>It is a very nice quality product that he will have for years to come and we won&#x27;t be spending an arm and a leg on razor blades.</li>
      <li>That being said, this is a very nice looking razor.</li>
      <li>over all, this is a very nice gift set.</li>
      <li>the brush is a very nice badger brush</li>
      <li>Already passers-by on the street have asked if I&#x27;m &amp;#34;some kind of astronaut&amp;#34; and I got an interview at a Madison avenue advertising agency for a job that I&#x27;m not even qualified for!</li>
      <li>The merkur that comes in here which is a very popular seller is still good but nothing compared to the edwin jagger DE89...</li>
      <li>I love it and love the savings!!!</li>
      <li>This is a good starter set to get into DE shaving</li>
      <li>The stand, brush, and shaving cream are of good quality.</li>
      <li>That being said, I will say they give me \\&quot;just as good of a shave\\&quot; as&lt;br /&gt;any 3 of 4 blade system I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>Brush types vary, but for creams a mid-range badger (under $50) should be a good start.  </li>
      <li>The Razor is excellent and light.  </li>
      <li>I also own the razor and it works great.</li>
      <li>nicely packaged as depicted in the listing, and then set inside an attractive gift box that needed no additional wrapping.</li>
      <li>But this is a good gift.</li>
      <li>Buy some good after shave lotion too.</li>
      <li>The soap that comes with was good and</li>
      <li>I did recieve mine in a gift box and it was beautifully and safely wrapped.</li>
      <li>My husband loves this brush, he feels like he gets a really good lather and is able to get a good shave.</li>
      <li>Just a nice setup.</li>
      <li>Everything is nice quality.  </li>
      <li>The stand is perfect and fits on the counter without taking up too much room.</li>
      <li>I recommend the feather popular razor, omega boar brush assorted colors handle, any razor/brush stand of your choice, and omega/proraso shave cream or van der</li>
      <li>just want to be honest.</li>
      <li>I bought a larger ceramic one that had great reviews and it works perfect.</li>
      <li>It looks so nice on that stand.</li>
      <li>The included stand, brush and shave cream were a nice incentive to buy this instead of just the razor itself.  </li>
      <li>but she had to find out on her own that she can return the brush for an exchange - except she lives in GA</li>
      <li>Unlike some others, mine came in a nice box.</li>
      <li>The handle is really nice and the omega shave</li>
      <li>And i am thrilled to have found the perfect birthday gift for my very tough-to-buy-for man.  </li>
      <li>Very Good, very happy with this product, and the quality was better than I expected.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everything came very nicely packaged, the quality of the product is tried and true, and the seller delivered on time and without any problems.  </li>
      <li>This one is by far the best for your money.</li>
      <li>and I feel the feather popular shaves better.</li>
      <li>He was pleased, really enthusiastic and became almost a bore telling me just how he used it</li>
      <li>The stand is sturdy, the razor is good quality, and the shave soap is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>The shave cream has a nice smooth feel and a nice smell.  </li>
      <li>The shaving soap provides, hands down, one of the best shaving experiences I&#x27;ve ever had and the closeness of the Merkur shaving razor is impeccable.</li>
      <li>Be sure to get very high quality razors to enjoy it best.</li>
      <li>Pretty happy with this, but bought it for a gift</li>
      <li>The chrome stand, brush and razor match each other perfectly and all seem of good quality and worked well.</li>
      <li>Great Items, however the gift box was not the exact box pictured, if that matters.</li>
      <li>Also, the razor replacements are very cheap.</li>
      <li>soap is easily whipped into a nice lather.</li>
      <li>He loved it and found the article funny and informative!</li>
      <li>Would recommend as a gift. :)</li>
      <li>more thing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping that I have more luck with</li>
      <li>It holds water well and provides a better lather than my drugstore bought boar.</li>
      <li>That being said, I&#x27;ve since replaced the razor for a parker, and the omega with a better quality soap.  </li>
      <li>I plan to use it mostly with my creams.  </li>
      <li>for the boar brush, it is awesome; however, I only use it with soaps.  </li>
      <li>It seems like his hair is finer and grows in more evenly?</li>
      <li>I also believe that his stubble looks somehow better as it grows in since he started using this razor.</li>
      <li>Glad I did because my boyfriend loves the Razor and the kit it comes with.</li>
      <li>they both absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>This made the greatest present.</li>
      <li>I bought this set along with some feather blades and love it.  </li>
      <li>Shaving with a Double Edged razor takes some getting used to as well as figuring out the best way to get the soap to lather up.  </li>
      <li>:) Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have an Edwin Jagger DE 89, which is a great razor by the way...and maybe i am spoiled by it.  The merkur that comes in here which is a very popular seller is still good but nothing compared to the edwin jagger DE89...the merkur is just not heavy enough in my opinion but overall this kit is a great deal and comes with everything you need and the razor and brush stand are amazing!  those are the two best items in this kit but if you are looking to get into DE shaving then i highly suggest this kit and then move on from there</li>
    <li> Great Items, however the gift box was not the exact box pictured, if that matters. The chrome of the stand doesn&#x27;t quite match that of the Brush and Razor either. They are clearly chromed, the stand has a very faintly yellow variance. Probably would have gone a different route had I known. Love the other products though.</li>
    <li> Quality, beauty, style and manly smell! It&#x27;s all the reasons you started wet shaving in the first place.  The omega soap is my every day standard!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brush, he feels like he gets a really good lather and is able to get a good shave. The set is very nice looking and looks great sitting out on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Be sure to get very high quality razors to enjoy it best.</li>
    <li> Very Good, very happy with this product, and the quality was better than I expected. Fast shipping, and good service.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for someone who was interested in getting into the vintage shaving scene.  This is a top rated merkur #180 razor [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]](which is hard to find in these \\&quot;kits\\&quot;),the brush was of excellent quality (unfortunately the cat agrees, he likes to hunt it on a nightly basis), and the soap dish is just an added bonus.  The gift was so well received that another family member was jealous, so they got one as a birthday present.  It was again, very well received!</li>
    <li> Well, HE loves it.  And i am thrilled to have found the perfect birthday gift for my very tough-to-buy-for man.  It really makes a difference in the smoothness of his face when he shaved this morning.  He remarked on his delight at rediscovering the true art of shaving technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nicely packaged as depicted in the listing, and then set inside an attractive gift box that needed no additional wrapping.</li>
    <li> Received the package as advertised.  The stand is sturdy and looks very nice.  The brush is a delight to look at and use.  Did not encounter any foul odor from the brush as it&#x27;s the case with some other ones. The Razor is excellent and light.  Shaving with a Double Edged razor takes some getting used to as well as figuring out the best way to get the soap to lather up.  With the one provided Merkur blade, I managed to get 6 days of shaving (each with downward and upward shaves) on each edge of the blade, for a total of two weeks!  That&#x27;s one blade @ 18-20 Cents per blade every two weeks.  I love it and love the savings!!!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome if you want to shave and look like a badass mofo. The blades are cheap, so it somewhat pays for itself in the end. Be ready to Freddy Krueger the hell out of your face if you have never spent the time to slowly shave or if you are used to shaving in the shower. You will get used to it within a day or two (the razor, not the bleeding). In the long run, this will make you like classy as balls... like James Bond classy.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette razors for years and years, got tired of the dragging and burning so I decided to try wet shaving. WOW what a diff, I was kinda scared at first with all the reviews but I used it just the same way I used my Gillette. What an awesome shave!!</li>
    <li> Just a nice setup. not great just nice.  I would look to another product if I were to buy again.  The brush very good. But the razor will slice and dice your face.  You have to go very slow.  I&#x27;s a pain to replace the blades because you have to disassemble the unit.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice little shaving kit for a first time safety-razor user. I bought this for a friend who has never used one before and he loves it. The Merkur razor is just good enough quality for a first time user. It&#x27;s not crappy to the point of tearing up your face but it&#x27;s not so fancy that it&#x27;s a loss if they decide they don&#x27;t like it. The brush, stand, and soap are also decent quality. Basically, none of this kit was junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t come with a little soap bowl. The soap that comes with was good and all but it would&#x27;ve been nice to have a little metal or ceramic bowl to use for other brands of soap that don&#x27;t come in their own case.</li>
    <li> Great shaving kit. I gave it to my brother in his birthday. He enjoys it a lot. I opened a new world of shaving products for him.</li>
    <li> This is a powerhouse of a male grooming accessories. The razor was built in Germany, and the shaving soaps from Italy.  The shaving soap provides, hands down, one of the best shaving experiences I&#x27;ve ever had and the closeness of the Merkur shaving razor is impeccable. This set will give you that smooth, clean-shaven face that could only normally be possessed by a Don Draper type of person. Already passers-by on the street have asked if I&#x27;m &amp;#34;some kind of astronaut&amp;#34; and I got an interview at a Madison avenue advertising agency for a job that I&#x27;m not even qualified for! Goes incredibly well with Canadian Club whisky and a Brooks Brothers suit.</li>
    <li> This razor provides a great shave albeit after a bit of a learning curve in getting used to using it. It will take you about a week to get comfortable in using this razor. The stand, brush, and shaving cream are of good quality.</li>
    <li> The classic and durable design is solid.  Everything is quality.  From the eucalyptus oil soap to the solid razor to the silver bristles, it is quality through and through.  This is a complete kit, albeit with only a single Merkur blade.  Great as a gift for someone wanting to stray from the plastic razors.</li>
    <li> This is my first foray into DE safety razor shaving and this set definitely was a great start, great quality. The chrome stand, brush and razor match each other perfectly and all seem of good quality and worked well. Not sure if it was the set or I was just nervous because of all of the articles I read talked about the difficulties in learning DE shaving but I had no trouble. Everything worked great and I did not have to use the styptic pencil I bought just in case. It was much easier than people made it sound.</li>
    <li> Perfect as a gift! An eco friendly alternative to your average, cheap disposable. I also own the razor and it works great.</li>
    <li> pretty cool little gift set.  It&#x27;s certainly worth the cash.  That being said, I&#x27;ve since replaced the razor for a parker, and the omega with a better quality soap.  Omega seemed to dry out my face.</li>
    <li> I received this set as a birthday gift recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, the brush part fell out of the handle.  I was lathering the soap and it just fell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to contact the company, but there isn&#x27;t a way to contact the company directly.  I tried to leave a question about what to do and how to contact the company (with no answer for a week).  My friend who bought the gift tried to contact Amazon but she had to find out on her own that she can return the brush for an exchange - except she lives in GA and I live in TX....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after no way to contact the company directly, no answer, and realizing returning the brush to Amazon would take way too long and it&#x27;s so inconvenient I&#x27;ve decided to just buy some epoxy glue and fix it myself.</li>
    <li> Everything is nice quality.  Would be nice to get an actual shave mug/bowl with this, but still a great deal.  The stand is sturdy, the razor is good quality, and the shave soap is pretty good.  I will probably purchase a higher quality shave soap, but this one does the trick and it will last a while.  Much longer than what comes in the aerosol cans.</li>
    <li> Do not, not get this because you think you can&#x27;t do it. I just gave it a first try having never used a safety razor before and within 30 seconds was shaving speedy and a few minutes later had a nick-free, skin-irritation free shave that is better than any I&#x27;ve ever experienced with a &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; (and my thick hair/sensitive skin). If I bought it all over again I&#x27;d buy the pieces separately and pick out a different shaving cream cuz this one smells like toilet bowl cleaner and I&#x27;m probably going to go out and buy an all natural one, since I enjoyed this way of shaving so much.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is if you have 10 minutes to shave, however often you do, and you can focus on a task for that long, get this old school style razor because it is 5x better than a Gillette Fusion or the like.</li>
    <li> This is a good starter set to get into DE shaving but I was expecting a bit more quality for the price. The stand is very basic and has some minor cosmetic blemishes but nothing major and does its job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very nice but it takes a few uses to soften up and get rid of the animal smell. It softens up faster than a boar brush and works well with both creams and soap. It holds water well and provides a better lather than my drugstore bought boar. That said I still think my omega boar works just as well but took a while longer to really soften up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is a Merkur long handle and I found it shockingly light. The only razor I can compare it to was the feather popular plastic body and I was expecting this razor to be much heavier but it is barely heavier than the feather popular. The razor shaves well but it is mild and I feel the feather popular shaves better. The finish on the razor is flawless but I don&#x27;t expect it to stay that way because the razor seems thin coated and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The omega shave cream is wonderful and provides a excellent cushion for the shave and protects nicely against nicks and cuts. My face felt super smooth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set overall is decent and I guess I was expecting to much for the price. My advice would be to buy the stuff separately if you can, that way you can personalize your set. I recommend the feather popular razor, omega boar brush assorted colors handle, any razor/brush stand of your choice, and omega/proraso shave cream or van der hagen/col conk shave soaps. My recommended set will cost less and will get you the same or better quality products. If you must get everything in one order than this set will do just fine. It&#x27;s your choice.</li>
    <li> Everything is great. I use it a lot and it still stays in the great condition it came in.</li>
    <li> This is a must get for any shaving enthusiast. I got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. The merkur razor is top notch and the brush is a high quality brush. The entire combination is a convenient package rolled into one. Everything he needs to get started. This is not a cheap plastic knockoff but the real mccoy.</li>
    <li> This was an awesome gift for my boyfriend!</li>
    <li> Ok - not great... kind of disappointed. bought for my son.. no directions on how to use and if you never used something like this before... anyway - the blade is not close enough</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance, and he loves it! I bought a starter blade pack from a different website, but everything else is from this starter packet. Highly recommend for a beginner at shaving old school style.</li>
    <li> I have had this set for about a month now.  I was doing some practice lathering (hand and cup) today and the ball of the brush became loose and is slipping in and out of the silver base.  Today was the first time that I fully submerged it in water, so that may be what loosened the glue or whatever is hold the hairs in the base.  This is a shaving brush so I would expect to be able to fully submerge the thing without issue.  The brush hasn&#x27;t lost many hairs, but unless I can re-glue it in the base it may be toast.  As for the razor and stand, they are fine and seem to be working out.  As for the cream, it is a lot harder than I would expect.  I can make an indentation with my fingers, but compared to Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s \\&quot;Sandalwood Shaving Cream\\&quot; it is hard as a rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product?&lt;br /&gt;No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice:&lt;br /&gt;Buy your razor, stand, cream and brush separately.  Brush types vary, but for creams a mid-range badger (under $50) should be a good start.  I&#x27;ve purchased an Edwin Jagger best badger for $37.35 today as a replacement till I get more skilled at wet shaving.  I plan to use it mostly with my creams.  I also purchased a Semogue 1305 Boar brush to use with my soaps.  I&#x27;m hoping that I have more luck with these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I did manage to repair the brush using some Liquid Nails (I love this stuff).  The entire head came out of the silver base; however, the hairs were kept together because their ends were encased in a plastic block.  I just put a dot of Liquid Nails in the silver base and put the hair ball back into it.  After I let it dry for 48 hours, it hasn&#x27;t moved at all and I&#x27;ve completely submerged this brush a number of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the \\&quot;Edwin Jagger\\&quot; brush, it is inferior to the brush that comes with this kit and I don&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the boar brush, it is awesome; however, I only use it with soaps.  You really need a badger brush for creams.</li>
    <li> Bought as gifts for father&#x27;s day and boyfriend&#x27;s birthday. they both absolutely love it. Would recommend as a gift. :)</li>
    <li> Razor is great but brush is glued into handle and fell out after about 6 months of use.</li>
    <li> Received as advertised, Box not exact, but nice and sturdy and just as good. The stand I received is solid and does not wobble. I&#x27;d be happier with Omega soap if they went back to there old formula of years past, but I knew it had change long ago so be it....So to review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right off the bat, let me say I am not new to DE Safety Razors. I also can&#x27;t say they give me the \\&quot;best shave of my life.\\&quot; That being said, I will say they give me \\&quot;just as good of a shave\\&quot; as&lt;br /&gt;any 3 of 4 blade system I have ever tried. I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 35 years and have tried just about every razor or electric shaver type on the market. I have found that the only real&lt;br /&gt;difference is the cost. I&#x27;ll take a safety razor from $25-$50 (cheaper if you go basic drugstore brand butterfly) and $20 worth of blades every 2 years or so over $100-$200 for 1 years worth of&lt;br /&gt;mach whatever. I bought this one to try out the longer handle, but to be honest I notice little difference other than weight compared to the shorter handle. If i buy another in the future I&#x27;d probably stick to the standard \\&quot;short\\&quot; handle but it&#x27;s not a big issue. That being said, this is a very nice looking razor. Basic 3 piece design and easy to change the blade. I did read one review saying it was hard, but maybe that reviewer only had one hand, in that case it might be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, I won&#x27;t go over the learning curve for a safety razor as most other reviewers have covered that, but  will say buy a sample pack of different blades. Tho the difference may be slight you will find a blade you like better then others.</li>
    <li> Very happy and my husband is  his birthday present it give him a much Smoother cut and he look great!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my husband, who was thrilled with the product at first. It looks so nice on that stand. However, the razor itself has given him some problems. Apparently the head of the razor spins around. We have been to stores that have confirmed that is not normal. He is looking for another razor to replace it with. Pretty disappointing since the set was about $100. It was a great idea, but didn&#x27;t quite hit the mark.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this gift set for my husband for Christmas. Other than the shipping method used, I am satisfied with the set. He is too. The only thing that I have noticed might wear out quickly is the brush, but for now I think it will do the job for at least a year or so. If you or the man in your life is considering &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; buy this gift set. It was a great deal for a beginner.</li>
    <li> Pretty happy with this, but bought it for a gift and it was not in the box is it pictured in.</li>
    <li> Was looking into starting to wet shave and my mom got me this for my birthday. What a beautiful set. The razor is a Merkur which is one of the top manufacturers of double edge razors. The stand brush are beautiful although I did get a strange smell from the brush on its first use the shaving soap quickly removed it. The stand is also a beautiful and sturdy addition to the gift set. I ordered a 25 variety pack of razors to go along with this set and have been using it for about 3 weeks now without any issues.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research for a inexpensive quality set. This one is by far the best for your money. I did recieve mine in a gift box and it was beautifully and safely wrapped. My husband is obsessed with this and he is not easily pleased!</li>
    <li> Got the idea for this from the website &amp;#34;art of manliness&amp;#34; and printed out the information from the article &amp;#34;How to shave like your grandpa&amp;#34; for my boyfriend&#x27;s 29th birthday.  He loved it and found the article funny and informative!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking around for a high quality double edge safety razor kit for a while now without breaking the bank. This kit had everything I needed including the stand, razor, badger brush, and soap. Shaving with this for the first time was quite the experience, I actually enjoy shaving now. Closer shave than I&#x27;ve ever had before. The smell of the soap is very relaxing as well. All made of high quality, heavy stainless steel. Definitely worth the investment. I&#x27;ll never have to buy one of those awful plastic disposable razors again.</li>
    <li> The pictures make it look as though it is ready to be gifted to that special someone..not so fast. The &amp;#34;gift box&amp;#34; is plain white with the word &amp;#34;GIFT&amp;#34; printed on the top, and the decorative shredded brown paper was no where in sight. Not a huge deal but don&#x27;t expect your gift shopping to end with the purchase of this item. Also, DO NOT PAY EXTRA FOR FAST SHIPPING!!! I paid an extra $30 that&#x27;s 1/3 the price of the whole damn gift and it took five days instead of the 3 that I paid for. The shipping was a rip off. If you&#x27;re buying the item for yourself and you don&#x27;t mind waiting it&#x27;s great. If you want it as a gift and need it quick, don&#x27;t count on it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get back to DE wet shaves and wanted a good quality, somewhat heavy razor.  The Merkur included in the box was exactly what I was looking for.  The included stand, brush and shave cream were a nice incentive to buy this instead of just the razor itself.  The brush is good quality and only lost a few bristles to begin with which is expected in a new brush.  The shave cream has a nice smooth feel and a nice smell.  I would recommend this for anyone wanting to get into double edge shaving.</li>
    <li> This is top of the line and made in Germany. My husband was very impressed. Very smooth shave that stays smooth the next day.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. This set, while perfectly acceptable, is not what I was hoping it would be. I was wanting something higher quality.</li>
    <li> The only thing I disliked about this package. was the razor did not open by twisting the bottom. You have to unscrew the head, in order to change the blade.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my dad who dropped his late father&#x27;s safety razor, and bent the guard. Has a great polished chrome finish. Brush is badger and not the coarser boar bristle. The Omega shaving soap makes a thick rich lather and lasts for many shaves. Also great scent, and leaves face soft. Others have said that the Merkur isn&#x27;t that great of a razor, but it is at least up the the quality of my 1960&#x27;s vintage Gillette. Unlike some others, mine came in a nice box. A plus to guys like me that don&#x27;t like wrapping gifts.</li>
    <li> My son was always having problems with razor burn, even with the expensive disposable. So after much reading and research I bought this for Christmas 2012. He went on line and watched tube videos about shaving  and after a few niks and missed shaved spots, he got the hang of it. Probably not too many 21 yo who use a straight razor. He loves it and would never go back. the only thing he has added is a pre oil that he applied before the shave.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new razor set.  It is a very nice quality product that he will have for years to come and we won&#x27;t be spending an arm and a leg on razor blades.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son for his 18th birthday as his first razor.  The balance and overall quality of this razor made this an excellent introduction to the manly art of shaving.  He recently told me this was the best gift he has ever received and he looks forward to using it for many years.</li>
    <li> I needed something classy and unique to give my stud of a husband for his 40th birthday.  I&#x27;ve always been intrigued by these old-school shave sets, mostly because they look so cool.  But I was concerned about whether or not they actually work well compared to modern razors.  After reading tons of reviews on this type of razor and method of shaving, what sealed it for me was the review from a guy that stated, \\&quot;Most bad-ass way to shave!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband LOVES this shave set!  Although he doesn&#x27;t always use the brush and shave soap (still prefers shave gel), the razor has become something he wouldn&#x27;t want to live without.  He even takes it with him when he travels.  It looks great displayed in the bathroom and everything cleans up beautifully. The razor gives the closest shave imaginable (can you say S-E-X-Y!!), and I hardly ever see a nick on his face.  This is partly because it shaves so beautifully, and partly because the blades are only $1 ea and you don&#x27;t feel you&#x27;re busting the bank to crack out a new blade!  It&#x27;s something that he says he would have never bought for himself, but now is one of the favorite gifts he&#x27;s ever gotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything came very nicely packaged, the quality of the product is tried and true, and the seller delivered on time and without any problems.  I did a lot of comparison shopping, and despite my desire to try to support local businesses when I can, I couldn&#x27;t find anything locally that wasn&#x27;t at least twice as expensive.</li>
    <li> over all, this is a very nice gift set. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars for theses reasons. the brush is a very nice badger brush but I prefer fuller ones. the stand is also very nice but rests on a foam cushion that makes it a little wobbly giving the impression that it will fall over. the razer is excellent for the first time wet shave stud (easy on newbies) made of great lifetime material. I encourage anyone to purchase the merkur blades because they really are superior to the cvs brand I previously used (mia culpa). I learned this lesson after using up the complimentary blade that came in the box. soap is wonderful too. other than that please understand I am sort of what my wife would call, a French poodle, aka snobbish. just want to be honest. but if a woman is purchasing this gift for a man who currently uses disposable razors and chemical filled foams know that you&#x27;ll give a gift that will not only make the your stock rocket in your man&#x27;s eyes but will pay dividends for years to come:)</li>
    <li> I did not appreciate having all these items cramped into an envelope instead of the box displayed in the photo.  The items are average, not simply beautiful.  I expected more and would have bought them individually at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t bother buying it as a set.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my husband and absolutely loves it! It&#x27;s exactly what I thought it would be, and then some.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaving set as a gift for my fiance. He was wanting to try a &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34; type razor to see if he could get a closer shave than what he was getting with a disposable. The set is beautiful and seems to be of great quality. When it arrived, it was missing the badger bristle brush. This was disapppointing, but I emailed the company that provides the product and they shipped the brush to me right away without any hassle at all; the brush arrived 2 days later. The set looks wonderful on the bathroom vanity. Even if my fiance didn&#x27;t use it, it would still be useful as a decorative piece! However, he ended up absolutely loving the set and uses it as his sole means of shaving. At first he had a few cuts and scrapes, but has since learned that shaving with this type of razor requires patience. He has not cut himself since he started taking his time while shaving. His shaves now leave his skin much smoother. I also believe that his stubble looks somehow better as it grows in since he started using this razor. It seems like his hair is finer and grows in more evenly? It could just be my eyes playing tricks on me though! :) Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This was my entry into the traditional shaving world.&lt;br /&gt;Very well built, never rusted, not even a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Solid.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband who was looking to switch to a safety razor. He loves it! Very good quality razor and brush. The stand is perfect and fits on the counter without taking up too much room. The bowl is way too small though. I bought a larger ceramic one that had great reviews and it works perfect. Also, the razor replacements are very cheap. My husband gets about 3-4 shaves with each razor switching it around. In all, a great product. Five stars if the bowl was larger.</li>
    <li> I bought this set along with some feather blades and love it.  At first I was getting a lot of irritation and a few cuts on my neck: it takes a few weeks for your face to get used to a new type of shaving.  I eventually figured out that going against the grain on my neck was causing the irritation.  I now shave downward above the chin line, and shave upwards on my neck.  The shaves are smooth as silk now.  At first I thought there was a problem with the shave soap.  It doesn&#x27;t produce the amount of lather you are used to with an aerosol shaving cream.  I bought a different kind of shave soap from a drug store but that soap didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the Omega Soap.  Buy some good after shave lotion too. You are going to need it when you first start using a safety razor.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy everything in here. I&#x27;m a beginner so I started out with this. The handle is really nice and the omega shave soap is easily whipped into a nice lather. It comes with a merkur blade but only one. The brush is pretty nice and has a matching handle to the rest of the set. The stand is solidly built and pretty good looking, but my one complaint would be things fall off of it too easily. The brush has a tendency to slide off and you have to be careful placing things. But this is a good gift.</li>
    <li> This is my second double edge razor, it is fantastic. I recommend you purchase a blade sampler pack and some Taylor of Old Bond Street cream, the Omega cream in the bundle is ok, you can get better.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for the old fashion shaver when a friend recommended I check out Amazon. Glad I did because my boyfriend loves the Razor and the kit it comes with. If you plan on buying one suggest you order extra blades because it only comes with one.</li>
    <li> Came promptly and was just as expected!</li>
    <li> Hard to find a gift for another man that shows you thought about it and them, that you know them and you wanted to do something special. Which is how I found this gift package. I use a Merkur razor and wanted to share the great experience and this seemed a perfect introduction. Not to mention all the other goodies. Most men today do not have the time to go for the full brush &#x27;n double edge razor shave. This well considered gift makes doing that an occasional pleasure even if not for everyday. He was pleased, really enthusiastic and became almost a bore telling me just how he used it, how great the brush was, how he was turned on to the Merkur razor etc. But, clearly, it was a successful gift and one I&#x27;ll remember to use again. What I regret is that I already have all the things included or I&#x27;d be inclined to buy one for myself.</li>
    <li> This made the greatest present. He have wanted one for so long. Thanks so much for such a great deal</li>
</ol>
