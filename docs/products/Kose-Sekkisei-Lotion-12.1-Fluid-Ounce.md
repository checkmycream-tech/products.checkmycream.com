    <li> I am glad I found this on Amazon with a good price. I use every single day, and my skin looks better. I will repeat using this for a while.</li>
    <li> When I first started use this product back in college(many years ago) it turned my facial skin from really yellow to really white, (I&#x27;m Asian). I was so white that my sisters call me &amp;#34; the wall&amp;#34;, because the wall is very white. And one of my roommate back then even stole my skin care product because I think she want to be as white as I am. I loved the product and used it for 6 years, then somehow I stopped using it because I wanted to try other product. Then my skin gradually became not as white, and then became yellowish like before I used this product. Now I&#x27;m buying this product again and this time I&#x27;m committed to use it for as long as it works on me!! I&#x27;ll update the review in a couple months and let u know my progress!</li>
