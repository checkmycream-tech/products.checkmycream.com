<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very scratchy at first! But after the first time I began to enjoy it. My skin is so soft now.</li>
    <li> Seemed harsh at first, but got used to it super quick.</li>
    <li> I am using this brush for dry brushing, but have found that wetting the brush makes it softer. I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t always need it to be softer, but for this beginner, it&#x27;s working lovely. I am glad that I won&#x27;t have to buy a stiffer brush when I want one. I will be able to &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; with this one.</li>
    <li> from other reviews, was really expecting something much harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;more or less does the job for now. but honestly not too different from your usual shower scrubby.</li>
    <li> Boy do these last!  I loved the last one, the price, the use of it... it lasted a long time, about 2 years.  Eventually realized I needed a stronger effect, so got another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to dry brush with these.  I&#x27;ve tried with so many other kinds of brushes in the past, but this one really is the best.  Love it!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this brush -- it is just the right size and and texture for skin brushing. I have been looking for a product just like it and am so happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The key to beautiful skin is keeping the top layer of cells turned over. At 67, I had begun to get withered looking skin on my upper arms, and dry brushing brought back their tautness and youthful glow.</li>
    <li> After receiving a massage on a cruise ship, actually the second one, the massage person used a brush at the beginning.  I loved how it felt, and of course she described the supposed benefits.  I bought this particular brush 1.) because of the decent price (which I usually don&#x27;t consider in my ratings)  2.) it had a slight handle, but not a huge handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles seems pretty stiff, but not needle-like.  I like the handle so it gives me leverage.  It is nice that it&#x27;s double sided so I don&#x27;t have to adjust the brush when I&#x27;m moving from front to back.  The loop is nice so you can hang it up on the wall.  I&#x27;m fairly flexible, and I&#x27;m able to do my back with this brush, but, if you aren&#x27;t very flexible, you may need a brush with a longer handle - or get someone else to do it.  I&#x27;ve used the brush dry and in the shower - it feels more invigorating dry, but I&#x27;m certainly not complaining about a wet brush ;)  My brush is still rather new, so I can&#x27;t comment on how long it will last, but it seems pretty sturdy and good quality - I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had body brushes before and loved them but this one is just way to stiff. It felt like it was scraping my skin off when I used it on my arms and stomach. The only place I could tolerate using it was my legs.</li>
    <li> I had never used a body brush before and when someone told me what it was, I ordered this one.  I love it.  My skin is shiny and soft now.  It takes some getting used to, but it&#x27;s a great product</li>
    <li> this brush is great!  i love that it&#x27;s made of palm, so it&#x27;s completely vegan and cruelty-free.  the bristles are nice and stiff, and although it can be a bit harsh and slightly painful to brush over your skin at first, you will get used to it after just a few days.  i find that after i brush my whole body (each day before my shower) i feel invigorated!  not only is it great in aiding your body in ridding its toxins, it&#x27;s a nice exfoliator too.  great value for the price, for sure!</li>
    <li> This is my first skin brush.  I like it. :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using this body brush for a few weeks now.  The bristles are firm, and yet a vigorous brushing does not irritate my skin at all, not even my face.  This brush leaves my skin feeling invigorated. I don&#x27;t see any visible difference in my skin yet (maybe I never will?), but my main reason for doing body-brushing is to help release toxins from my body.  Judging by how thirsty I am after each brushing session, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely doing something!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these brushes and I love them. Evry night before I take my bath, I spend about ten minutes dry body brushing with this brush. I prefer this shorter handled brush for dry body brushing. I believe it gives more control. Don&#x27;t brush too hard. You will gradually begin to increase the intensity as your skin gets use to it. I like to apply an oil after the bath. The combo of the dry body brushing and the body oil leaves skin smooth, velvety and silky. I can definitely see a difference on days I get a little lazy and skip the body brushing. I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Great body brush. I&#x27;ve used this a couple of times and I really like it. It&#x27;s firm enough to exfoliate and really make your skin feel stimulated and good. It&#x27;s very relaxing too.</li>
    <li> I know it looks like a toilet brush, but trust me, if you are serious about getting rid of black heads or ingrown hairs on your body, use this brush!  It&#x27;s the perfect size for handling.  I use this brush in the shower to prevent ingrown hairs where I wax and/or shave. Arms, legs,  etc.  Best results are achieved if you use this regularly over a period of time.  Exfoliating once a month won&#x27;t do it.  Anways initially the brush is pretty hard/stiff, just saturate it with water and soap before you scrub and it&#x27;ll soften up a bit.  After a long time period it loses it&#x27;s stiffness and you&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s time for a new one.  My waxist was just as pleased as I was that I had gotten no ingrown hair bumps, all because I scrub with this brush during every shower.  I keep this brush on my Amazon wishlist and order it about every 3 months.  I&#x27;ve tried others, but for serious exfoliators you know you need a bristle that&#x27;s a little hard to see results cause essentially you&#x27;re getting rid of a thin layer of skin and brush out the ingrown stuff/ clogged underneath.  I had my husband try it for a week solid, and he noticed a difference on the back of his legs.  I will be ordering these for as long as I can think.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this thing are very rough &amp; scratch quite a bit, if using dry. I could easily use it on back, arms, legs, but for the chest &amp; torso it was a little too firm. It was much softer as a wet brush, but that is not why I bought it. Still worth having around, for the price. Seems very durable, no shedding.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to aid in cleaning my lower parts with antibacterial soap. The brush is not very heavy duty as far as it&#x27;s handle. It will bend easily and the hairs fall out of it after about a month of steady use. I am on month 3 with mine and the hairs not only fall out but the handle wrapping coming apart and the wire it has underneath has been bent so many times that it is becoming worthless and ready to snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what to recommend as I am new to buying a bath brush and have issues with several brands of back brushes I have purchased as well. But if you need a brush to clean your feet well, your butt area this brush works well for a time. Also if you are dealing with excessive body hair you will like this brush as it has pretty strong bristles that can work through the hair and really clean out the pores underneath.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes for dry exfoliation... Use daily for notable decrease in cellulite and stretchmarks</li>
    <li> Great for exfoliating</li>
    <li> I love this Japanese bath brush! It is great used wet or dry for bathing or to increase circulation and eliminate toxins from the system. Great quality, fair price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift. Looks great though.</li>
    <li> Would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Great exfoliater.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews before I decided on this brush. My main factor was the price second to the reviews. I am new to body brushing and didn&#x27;t want to sink in a lot of money if I didn&#x27;t like it. I am so glad I bought this brush. I thought it would hurt but it felt good and I felt energized! I noticed from just one use how my skin felt softer and smoother. So if you are interested in body brushing I recommend this brush. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this brush. It is good quality and the bristles are stiff but don&#x27;t hurt. They give a nice, exhilarating massage. You will be happy you got this!</li>
    <li> THIS BRUSH IS EXCELLENT, NOT TOO HARD NOT TOO SOFT, JUST PERFECT.  EASY TO HOLD ON TO AND WORK DRY BRUSHING WITH.  FINIALLY, I FOUND MY BRUSH :)</li>
    <li> ITS AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and the body brush is great.  I mostly use this for my back but it honestly can be used anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles do not fall off as quickly and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in my skin. All the dead cells come off without causing any redness - a worry I had since I have sensitive skin. There is no peeling or irritation, just a nice smooth feeling.</li>
    <li> Using this brush has made a big difference in my morning routine. I&#x27;ve been scrubbing about a month now prior to shower and I feel energized by increased circulation.</li>
    <li> I read about dry body brushing on a beauty blog and immediately put this Japanese palm brush in my cart. Leave it to the wonderful Japanese to have a tried and true solution to all my skin needs.  Dry brushing before the shower removes dead skin cells leaving my skin sooo smooth.  I&#x27;ve used it daily for the last 5 days and my skin is noticeably softer. My shave was immaculate and ingrown hairs have been banished. The claims of improved circulation may be true - I haven&#x27;t noticed. But good grief my skin feels amazing.  Now I need a facial dry brush!</li>
    <li> Been using a back brush for decades.  Can&#x27;t reach otherwise.  On a whim tried this Body Brush.  Many, most, speak of using dry.      Hangs next to back brush in shower.  Wish there were colors to indicate my enthusiasm.  This brush has changed the whole \\&quot;get clean and feel fresh all over\\&quot; experience.  Using liquid soap dispensor.  One squirt on palm and rub on brush.  Scrub arm, shoulder, with lots of lather produced.  Brush is soft and feels great.  Other arm and shoullder then neck to waist, lots of lather from one squirt soap.  Once for each leg all sides top to bottom and else where, LOL      Feels so good and clean I would rather have this hand brush than the back brush although I use that too but just for the back because this short handle brush can&#x27;t reach.  Now my wife loves it too.  Only been a month so longevity is open.  Feels and works great on my face too.  Rinsing between each soap application assures clean again.  Hang it on little wire rack under shower head to drain.  Shower experience improved by this simple inexpensive brush.  So?  Please try it, (^o-)/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this body brush for dry brushing - it&#x27;s so much better than the standard long wooden-handled back brush I&#x27;ve had in the past (including the one with the detachable head, which turned out to be more of a nuisance than an asset).  The little bit of visible plastic at the end mars the aesthetic a little - it would be prettier with wood instead, but then it&#x27;d be a lot pricier I&#x27;m sure, and there&#x27;s not one anyway.  Of all the options, I&#x27;m really happy with this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how simply brushing your body can make one feel so good.  This is a nice, well-made brush and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to stimulate their skin and body.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works great!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great. No need to spend tons of money for a spa version. I&#x27;ve been using this one for a year and it is still new looking and effective.</li>
    <li> Not to stiff, feels just right. Makes my skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars but the hand grip has a few stray, pointy fibers that dig into my hand.  I will have to find small scissors to snip them as I find them, yes, they hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the dry brushing: Love It!  If this is your first time, be sure to take it lightly since this is a hard, vegan bristle brush.  Start at your feet, using long, gentle sweeps, working towards the heart.  If you remember that all strokes are towards the heart you can&#x27;t go wrong (it helps you work towards the lymph nodes if you don&#x27;t know where they are).  Dry brushing not only makes your skin feel alive, exfoliates, gets the blood pumping, it also is touted as helping your lymph system work better.  After each dry brushing, you build up your skin&#x27;s tolerance and can brush a bit harder next time.  I like to dry brush before bed as it relaxes me and helps me sleep better.  When I dry brush at night I use circular motions and do it for the massage aspect.  I will dry brush in the tub, before my morning shower, using the long, sweeping motions towards the lymph nodes and heart.  I use a separate plastic brush for the shower so I don&#x27;t get my dry brushes wet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lovely! Have to work it in a few days to get used to the bristles, but overall, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Rough, but not too rough. Not flimsy at all. I read other reviews about bristles falling out. I don&#x27;t anticipate that at all. I love it. And will order another when I need to. Well made. Actually I expected lesser quality for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> Skin has gotten much smoother after using this daily before showers. I would recommend moisturizing with coconut oil afterward!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush when I read that it can help to reduce the appearance of cellulite when used over time.  I&#x27;ve been using for several weeks now and to be honest I don&#x27;t really see a difference in the cellulite.  However, my entire body is so much softer snd smoother.  Even my husband has commented on how soft my skin is.  Now body brushing has become a morning ritual.  It does help to envigorate me in the morning.  For best results use right before showering and apply lotions afterwards.</li>
    <li> I just started body brushing, and bought this one after reading the reviews. It was a great purchase and I use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> I use it for dry brushing before showers and it works very well.</li>
    <li> This brush works very well for wet brushing while taking a bath. Highly recommended.  More details... I bought this brush about 1 month ago and have been using it every day for wet brushing while taking a bath. Many of the reviews on here are from people using the brush for dry brushing, and because the bristles fall-out during dry brushing the reviewers assumed that the brush would not be good for wet brushing. Quite the contrary... The brush actually works very well for wet brushing while taking a bath and doesn&#x27;t loose very many bristles at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted to dry brushing and this tool fills the bill.  The only slight drawback is the grip; it&#x27;s too prickly.  I have gotten fiber slivers from the handle.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, but... And there sadly is a but was not that great of an exfoliate. It did at first do the job, I read several reviews of people using only on dry skin so I did that for a few time but the thought of dry dead skin flasks kinda grossed me out so next I used wet and noticed that the bristles kinda just lay flat. After about 5 uses wet and dry total it just wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love love love! I was very skeptical about dry body brushing.. but I&#x27;m absolutely hooked! Highly recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> Excellent brush wet or dry. Smoothing, exfoliating, invigorating...ahhhhh.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used these brushes for several years. They last a long time and hold up very nicely in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see a review saying it got moldy after getting wet. I use this all the time in the tub and have never had any problems at all.</li>
    <li> This brush is not soft or satisfying against your skin.  The seller told me they will get softer once they get wet couple times and used, but I sought to use it for dry brushing.  They also were not an Earth Therapeutic brush either.  They are by New England Naturals and they are made in China.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Best one I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave this brush four stars instead of five is because I would have have preferred to receieve the brush wrapped since I would be using this item all over my body.  the brush was just placed in the box with a piece of bubble wrap.     On a positive note, (after rinsing it) I used the brush prior to showering and I love the way the bristles feel on my skin - not too hard or too soft. I also love the design of he brush. I just received it a couple of days ago, so it&#x27;s still too early to tell.  However, I think I&#x27;m going to like this whole body brushing thing.</li>
    <li> ok.. sorry for being stupid, but wow. It is SUCH a cool dry brush. (either that or drybrushing in general is OG lol but wtfe i like the brush) It helps with my bigo booty. lol I had a lil sum sum that made me shy away from my man seeing my booty all the time lol :(cellulite.. ewww! ikr?) well, it&#x27;s gone. I improved the diet, cut some fats and drybrushed the hell outta my body. not only do I report much softer skin overall.. but my ugly few bumps are almost ALL gone. wooohooo. five stars you awesome brush u. haha and whatever. to those that are like wow too much info. lol yoouunnooo yall get annoying things like this. were human people! GET OVA IT. I&#x27;m being real OKAY? &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a brush to clean the pores on your body this is it! I use this brush dry before bathing but would not hesitate to use it wet as well. Easy to grip and the bristles feel great on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s great for dry-brushing, or for a good scrub in the shower.  The bristles are just rough enough for me.  They do tend to squash down with regular use, but that doesn&#x27;t substantially diminish the brush&#x27;s usefulness.  The handle sometimes feels a big flimsy in my hand.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s under the wrapping fibers, but it frequently feels as if it&#x27;s going to come apart during a good hard scrub.  It hasn&#x27;t though, so I&#x27;ve stopped worrying about it.</li>
    <li> It could do to be a bit longer for the back, but it&#x27;s otherwise perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush feels natural. The bristles are stiff, but not too harsh - just what I was hoping for a dry brush. You can see and feel this brush exfoliating your skin. I don&#x27;t use it with water though as Id like to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get mildew.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can exfoliate my body, then hop in the shower and rinse it all off, feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: One issue I had with this is that the bottom bristles start to poke into you palm and it can be very irritating to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Using it in the shower, the brush started shedding a good bit and smelling, which led me to soak it in some hydrogen peroxide, but I ended up finding this brush that has now held up over a year and hasn&#x27;t shed at all, which is a relieve [[ASIN:B0016ISD04 100% Natural Boar Bristle Body Brush with Contoured Wooden Handle]].</li>
    <li> A nice stiff brush without being scratchy.  Easy to clean,  holds up well with use.</li>
    <li> This brush looks familiar... oh yea, it resembles something you clean the toilet with! :)&lt;br /&gt;When this brush arrived, my boyfriend asked me why I ordered a toilet brush from amazon, haha. Honestly, I think if I placed a toilet brush on my skin, it might feel the same way as this brush does.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to badmouth this brush because it was cheap, but boy does it hurt! I try to be as gentle as possible when I dry-brush, but the fibers are pretty rough. However, I know for a fact when I use this, the blood in my body is definitely flowing.</li>
    <li> It made my skin softer and smother.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had heard that brushing your skin makes it more healthy and vibrant. I also wanted something that I could use before getting into the shower to help remove the dead skin cells from my arms and neck. This works really great. It&#x27;s not too abrasive and it does a fine job in removing the dead skin. After using this product you will be amazed at how your skin is more supple and smooth and looks more healthy.  It may take a while to get use to the feel of the brushing, but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this and use it on my arms and legs every morning and night. Doesn&#x27;t hurt and actually feels brisk and numbing.</li>
    <li> This brush works wonders...!!! After the first week of using it, my boyfriend commented on how soft my skin was. I noticed it was softer as well and was amazed....! A coworker brushed against me and asked, why was my skin so soft:) I HIGHLY.....reccomend this brush! I have used other brushes and they do not produce results like this one. Brush your entire body everyday before you shower and in no time you&#x27;ll have baby soft skin!</li>
    <li> This is an all natural body brush for dry skin brushing. It&#x27;s very sturdy with nice fine bristles. They don&#x27;t fall out very much which is nice. It&#x27;s a good size and really works well! Will buy another one when this one retires. Good price as well :D</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very comfortable brush, not too stiff or too soft; however, it sheds a bit so you might want to brush off in the tub/shower or someplace easy to clean.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for dry brushing! Service was great, they even included a free gift sponge. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job. Not too soft or too hard.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it&#x27;s helping my circulation and I&#x27;ve noticed that&lt;br /&gt;cellulite is going away with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the size of it, perfect for use all over your body.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin really soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy with it!</li>
    <li> way too harsh on skin</li>
    <li> This was my first dry-brush purchase. At first it hurt a little but now I crave the scraping of these little bristles. Say goodbye to dead body skin! I&#x27;ll definitely continue dry brushing after this one wears out.</li>
    <li> Feels great, not to stiff, not too soft. My skin feels invigorated after using it. The only thing I didn&#x27;t love about it is that a few bristles came out while I was using it. Nothing major at all, just a few.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it to dry brush my skin and I got great results. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I just recently started body brushing but all the brushes I found were way too rough. I found this one and it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s rough enough to do the job but soft enough to not hurt when you use it.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush! It is rough but leaves my skin feeling energized after dry brushing and showering! I wish I would have gotten the two pack now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to dry brushing, but so far I like the way this brush feels and I am getting used to the method in which you are to use it to help stimulate the lymphatic system.  I prefer my weekly massages to this for that purpose, but this is a nice enhancement to my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> I had never used a body brush before this one. I had no idea what a difference using this type of body brush could make. I was regularly using a moisturizing scrub in the shower and thought it was doing a great job. But the difference I saw after using this brush for about 2 weeks was amazing. I now have beautiful, silky, clear skin. No more bumps on my arms! I also use Hawaiian Tropics Firming Island Glow Daily Moisturizer after brushing - the combination has been amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this dry brush.  I use it every morning before my shower.  I wake up so early and never want to get out of bed, but using this dry brush helps wake my body up.  I feel invigorated and my skin is getting smoother.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to start a body brushing regimen. I&#x27;d never done it before, but I&#x27;m so glad I started. Look up the benefits if you&#x27;re considering it yourself. I&#x27;m very glad I started out with this brush. The bristles are a little stiffer than I expected, but it&#x27;s definitely not too difficult to handle at all, even during the first few times of use until your skin gets used to it. I saw several reviews stating that the brush sheds bristles quite a bit at first, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding at all in mine. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to this and the idea but it&#x27;s been a very simple yet very pleasurable addition. I started it to improve circulation to my whole body but in specific my stomach. I just had a baby and I read this can help with that skin tightening which I sadly REALLY needed after only my 1st child. So far so good! But even outside of that it feels wonderful! and its one of the best parts of my day where I feel like I get to pamper myself.     I highly recommend this brush, it has good reach without being overly long /big or taking up much space and gives that nice getting your back scratched feeling all over your body.</li>
    <li> I received my brush and tried it out today. The bristles are tolerable. The dry brushing felt wonderful. Ibtotally recommend and I&#x27;m a newbie to dry brushing.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Make gentle circles with it before getting into the tub/shower.</li>
    <li> I love this, it&#x27;s not too rough, nice massage while you are in the shower. If it had a hook to hang it in the shower it would be a five.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product ive been using it for some time now but i have to say i have seen great results. My skin looks like its glowing now and almost looks flawless. I will continue to use this and recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Great brush. Really gets the blood circulation going, which helps with cellulite reduction and the elimination of toxins. Not too scratchy. I have sensitive skin so I lightly brush my skin and have had no irritation. I got rid of my dry itchy skin on my legs immediately. Very happy I decided to try dry brushing. This company shipped my product right way.</li>
    <li> Love it. Very rough but feels good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had so much trouble with dry skin the last few years when it starts to get cold. I&#x27;ve bought so many products that claim to scratch off your dead skin cells but they were too soft! I have even bought products for men thinking that maybe it was only women&#x27;s products that were too soft. When I read other peoples&#x27; reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot, but I didn&#x27;t have much hope. I love this brush! It actually gets my dead skin off, it makes a perfect scratcher, and I can feel a difference! I&#x27;ve even used this on my face. Yes it&#x27;s a bit rough, but if you plan on getting your dead skin off and not rubbing what is the equivalent of soft sand on your body then this brush is perfect! I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend body brushing for an overall boost to health and well being, and this brush is inexpensive, functional, and does the job as well as any. It&#x27;s also made of natural fibers, which is nice.</li>
    <li> These things are great for exfoliating the skin. My wife likes to tell me all the time that my epidermis is showing. She is quite the jokester. I ordered this and now the joke is on her. No more epidermis anymore!! Takes the first layer right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have used these before you will understand my sarcasm. They do exactly what they are supposed to and are great at removing dead skin and exfoliating living skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: it doesn&#x27;t remove the first layer of skin know as the epidermis. That was a joke and only there for the purpose of getting cheap laughs. The feeling you get from this brush is natural and it feels quite good. I imagine it is great for cleaning potatoes also.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT .  I BOUGHT THEM FOR CHRISTMAS!  I LOST MINE , I PAID A LOT MORE FOR THE PRODUCT THEN WHAT THEY ASKED FOR IT.  TOOK AWHILE  TO GET USE TO THE STIFF PRODUCT, BUT ONCE YOU DO YOU WILL LOVE THE STURDINESS .  I LEFT  IT IN A HOTEL.  I SURE WAS MAD, UNTIL I FOUND THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> I love how rough the bristles are but not too rough. This is perfect for dry brushing. I will be purchasing another one here soon because my other one is almost 3 months old. I would stock up on these so you don&#x27;t have to keep buying lol. Great purchase! I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this body brush. I ordered the standard popular version and this one and used both in the week. This brush was much better for me when it came to brushing my stomach and chest area. Whereas with the standard it just hurt too much in those areas for a person who is just starting out with dry skin brushing. I decided to continue with this and later when it replacing time, see if I can tolerate the other. It is very neat to see how much dry skin is removed and how soft it is after my fist use. I look forward to seeing what happens in upcoming weeks.</li>
    <li> a bit too harsh for my sensitive body.  i used it once as others described and then felt itchy all over. haven&#x27;t used it again. i&#x27;m afraid to.</li>
    <li> My new favorite for the shower. I bought 15 to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> Maybe it was the bristles of this brush but it made my sensitive skin itch and begin welting up in certain places. I will try my luck at a softer bristle dry brush...</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! Use it everyday before I shower. At first, it hurt for a couple of days. However, I feel the difference on my skin!!! My skin is so much softer!!! I immediately felt the difference after using this dry brush for a week! It is amazing. I am actually going to get another one for my mom. She tried the brush when I brought it at the spa and she loved it. It is great quality and great price!! You can not go wrong!!! I had the brush for three months already and it is still in fantastic condition.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good all natural brush for dry brushing. This brush is prefect, its not too rough, but its not soft either. It works great. The handle is a little rough to hold but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I am just glad that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> Nice. Works well. Skin seems much softer and less dry.</li>
    <li> This one is little soft for me...but great for beginners..I bought one for my boyfriend to get started...skin brushing is the way to beautiful skin</li>
    <li> Love this brush... it is soft, yet strong enough to do the dry brushing technique, love it wet or dry, it works great ♥</li>
    <li> Did you know that, if not taken care of properly, you can have up to 2 lbs of dead skin cells on you? Crazy, right? I received this brush as a gift and I was a little skeptical at first, due to my sensitive, dry skin. But I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve used it ONE time all over my body and I can already feel a difference. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s very rough and I&#x27;m hoping that is softens after a few uses. It actually scratches my skin a little and I&#x27;m afraid to use it near my tattoos. I do highly recommend this item and I plan on getting a smaller one for my face soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of dry brushing my skin all over before a shower, and this brush is a handy size for that.  At first it lost so many bristles I thought it would be bald in a month, but that stops after the first few uses.  It still may drop a bristle or two, but I consider that normal.  The brush is stiff enough to slough off the dry skin, but gentle enough to use everyday without skin damage.  The price is great, too...it replaces a worn out $45 brush, and since it is recommended that a brush be replaced every few months, at this price it&#x27;s not painful to do so.  My skin feels like a baby&#x27;s (well, a geriatric baby) after using this brush for just a few weeks...all of those anoying little bumps on my legs are gone, gone, gone!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This brush does exactly like it stated. I cannot live without it now that I&#x27;ve tried it. Hold tight for your skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> Kinda too rough for my skin</li>
    <li> Great. Skin is supersoft. Can&#x27;t attest to how my lymphatic system is doing.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for radiant skin.</li>
    <li> Really nice, and I got it so fast, I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived, it is considered the best to use if you look up what&#x27;s the best I will let you know thanks Earth Therapeutics</li>
    <li> This has held up very well for dry brushing several months after I&#x27;ve purchased it.</li>
    <li> Love the all natural fibers and the way it feels- not too hard not too soft- a good intermediate brush that gets the job done. A good swabbing with this thing and you&#x27;ll never feel clean again without it. If you really give it some elbow grease, you&#x27;ll be energized, baby soft and furthermore, completely appalled at the muck that comes off of you!</li>
    <li> I used this brush once, maybe twice in the shower. The next time I went to use it was covered in mold! It specifically says it &amp;#34;may also be used wet.&amp;#34; Nope. It might be ok to use for dry brushing, but definitely should not get wet and the description should be changed to reflect that.</li>
    <li> This review is for DRY brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush arrived loose in the box uncovered and unwrapped. Given the dirt it collected, I was a little grossed out. Washed it very well with soap. The brush looked like it was already falling apart, but I am hoping it will not shed too much and hold out for a few months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles were very rough and sharp and literally left visible surface scratches as I worked it up my skin, although I used no pressure at all. That might be the case with most bristle brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized I need to brush in the direction of the bristles. It is much more comfortable and relaxing that way, unless I accidentally go in the wrong direction! ouch. And of course, if you wet the brush, it is much softer for those who plan to use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 1/2 stars</li>
    <li> I totally love this brush - I love the way it feels when I use it, the way it feels when I hold it and the way it looks.  If you have very sensitive or thinning skin, you might look for something else as the bristles are pretty stiff - but my skin just feels invigorated.  Who knew skin brushing could feel so good &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> i only recently learned about dry body brushing and decided to take the plunge to try it.  bought a facial brush and two body brushes.  this brush is too much stimulation for the more tender skin on my stomach and sides, but is great for my feet and legs up to inner thighs and hips.  i use the Sublime Beauty Skin Brush for mu upper body, and the Bass Face Brush on my face and neck.  i really do like this dry body brushing.  have only done it for a few days now, but it may be that i will stick with it.</li>
    <li> This body brush is wonderful.  I have been using it for 2 weeks and it has made a very noticable difference in the texture of my skin.  I had hair bumps every where and now my skin is soft as a baby&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This brush was extremely rough. I&#x27;ve actually been using it in conjunction with at-home pedicures. It works well for exfoliating feet but felt extremely harsh on my body.</li>
    <li> this is a dry body brush, meaning you use it before you shower to stimulat circulation and expoliate. brush in long even strokes  towards the heart. it&#x27;s a tad scratchy feeling, and sometimes i do forget to use it before i shower, especially when it&#x27;s super cold, but i find my winter skin is less itchy.</li>
    <li> dont have near bathroom area/moisture it WILL mold</li>
    <li> I received this brush in a padded envelope that was slashed open at the top, right across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself was not very impressive either. Seemed too rough and cheaply made. And I wouldn&#x27;t use anything like this, that arrived in an open package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot about dry brushing but my concern continues to be how to keep the brush itself clean and hygienic, use after use. Any suggestions? I&#x27;m still going to look for a dry brush to use but this isn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent a request for a refund, hopefully it won&#x27;t be a big long hassle getting one. :-(</li>
    <li> i use is 2 times daily I think it helps smooth. i recommend. try it. i like it. good investment.</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt so soft…I was amazed by this brush! It took some getting used to though. Love it!</li>
    <li> they say this has all sorts of benefits, i havent really seen much happening yet and ive used it for 3 months now, i can only hope its doing what it says</li>
    <li> I love the way this brush exfoliates my skin and helps me to get those hard to reach areas. My skin is definately softer and smoother since I&#x27;ve been using it. I would definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> Item arrived very quickly, great communications with seller.  Brush is a perfect size, just a LITTLE bit stiffer than I would have liked, but is softening up with daily use.</li>
    <li> I decided to try body brushing and chose this one for my first one.  The price is good, especially if I decided I didn&#x27;t like it.  However, I do like it!  It&#x27;s a bit stiff, and does seem to shed a bit.  Using light to gentle pressure it leaves slight scratches on my arms, but these are not noticeable after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 Jun 14 update.  I have been using this brush since my first review.  I now use a medium-heavy pressure, I don&#x27;t see any scratches on my arms.  I have found the backs of my shoulders absolutely adore getting brushed!</li>
    <li> Bought them for every woman I know.</li>
    <li> When the brush is wet I think it is very comfortable. I lather up with this brush.  Keeps me smooth. Love it.  In time the twine holding the handle comes unwound and the brush is done. One star down for that. It has happened on each one I purchased but I still love the brush. Its a nice scrub!  Sorry , no video! ;-)</li>
    <li> The bristles are harder and less even than I expected, so I don&#x27;t use it as much as I would like to. The ones that are longer and tougher leave very light scratches on my skin, but I suppose I&#x27;m more sensitive and that&#x27;s what you get with all natural fibers. It does its job pretty well, although I&#x27;m also not sure how it&#x27;s meant to be cleaned...</li>
    <li> Very good quality body brush....this sucker will really get you going in the morning! I am really enjoying this brush....I begin with the soles of my feet and brush upwards on my legs in light, long strokes. Then my palms and my arms (always brush towards the heart)...then my buttocks and back, then shoulders the my stomach. So invigorating and you can just see those dead skin cells sloughing right off. Some people buy into body brushing and some don&#x27;t. All I know is it makes me feel amazing as my skin is soft as can be!</li>
    <li> Read online that using this daily can reduce the appearance of cellulite, remove excess skin cells, and allow skin to appear brighter.  Other than these benefits, this brush is coarse enough to be effective, yet soft enough to brush in more sensitive areas.  Great product!</li>
    <li> The shipping is pretty slow but other than that I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. The brush is luxury for your skin. Feels so nice. If you&#x27;re going to get a dry brush, this is the one to get, no doubt.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone,I just love the deep cleaning this body brush gives me.&lt;br /&gt;I am a landscape Designer and outside all the time with the crew setting up jobs and og course&lt;br /&gt;I get dirty, this brush cleans deep into your pores so when you are done showing you are clean of any dirt&lt;br /&gt;So ! I give this a 5-STAR rating.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Barker&lt;br /&gt;Ellicott City, Md.</li>
    <li> Great product it works well. Just wished it had a longer handle.</li>
    <li> Initially purchased this brush for dry brushing... After running my fingers over it, I had to try it out in the bath w some body wash. I use a great Weleda body wash w sea buckthorn. A little goes a very long and you get an even creamier lather using this brush. It lathers well and exfoliates beautifully. Will be purchasing 3 more of these next order to have one for dry brushing, one for bathing and a back up.</li>
    <li> If you like to practice abhyanga you&#x27;ll like to add this to your routine. It is a good size and perfect for dry brushing before oils and/or shower. Very handy and sturdy, but not too rough. I use it before my shower, I also brush in the shower with a different brush and apply avocado oil after. My skin feels amazing!</li>
    <li> I am exicted about this brush because i have dry skin and cellulite.  I am hoping to improve both conditions.</li>
    <li> Works as promised - I would give it a higher rating except for the excess shedding the first 3 or 4 times I used it. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I use it to dry brush my body before showering and I always feel amazing afterwards. My skin glows and I find that if I don&#x27;t do this before showering, I miss it. I have had mine for a while now and it still looks great. I have not had to deal with losing Bristles from this brush. It is well made, great quality.</li>
    <li> This body brush is very effective therapeutic skin care, particularly before showering.  The short handle makes it difficult to reach one&#x27;s back, but hasn&#x27;t presented a problem when you have someone all too happy to do the entire job himself.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for dry-brushing my skin.  It seems like a decent brush, but nothing outstanding. It seems to shed a little more than I though it should.  It is pretty rough and scratchy, but that is to be expected.  It is not unbearable to use, and my skin does feel smoother after using it for a few weeks.  I have had other softer brushes that did the job just as well, so I would warn anyone that doesn&#x27;t want a really scratchy experience to maybe stay away from this one as there are softer brushes available. Although, I think if you buy this one and stick with it you would get used to it pretty quickly and be pleased with how it exfoliates.</li>
    <li> I brought this brush to pamer myself but a year ago my husband got me brushing him. This is the second brush and it lasted a long time. He likes to me to rub his back with this.</li>
    <li> My first dry brush and this did not disappoint!</li>
    <li> LOVE this body brush, but wish I could find out whether or not the Japanese palm is FROM Japan. Sadly, I don&#x27;t want to buy anything from Japan, any more. Great brush, though, and I haven&#x27;t had any problem at all with the shedding other reviewers have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 6th NOV 2013: have now been using this brush both wet (in the shower, which cleans the brush, as well) and dry. Still love it, and still not having any problem with bristles shedding.</li>
    <li> Waiting to see the results that stacy keibler claims this brings but it wasn&#x27;t too expensive and does the job so far.</li>
    <li> This dry brush is perfect. It is very high quality and works well with helping me to reduce the appearance of stubborn leg cellulite. I have used it every day for the past month and not only has it not lost a bristle but I can no longer see the cellulite!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted for dry brushing!  Works great</li>
    <li> this is an awesome body brush. the first few times I used it, it was a little stiff but after a week or so it softened up some and works and feels great.</li>
    <li> Love this body brush for dry brushing before showering. It is a Great way to exfoliate the skin and brush away dead skin cells.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and flares up and turns red at everything, so I was surprised when this brush turned out to be the perfect texture. The fibers are pliable but the ends are just stiff enough to brush your skin without leaving redness. I use it just about everywhere except my face, it would be too harsh there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, I only use this for dry brushing (right before a shower); this is NOT intended for using in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits of dry brushing for me, so far: My skin is smoother, especially on the arms. Skin also looks brighter. I have had bad circulation all my life so this is great for me. I have no idea if it affects the lymphoid system at all, but at least it gets some blood flowing to the skin. I recommend you try it if you have skin texture problems.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush.  It is not too stiff and bristly and not too soft.  It is just right as Goldilocks would say.  It doesn&#x27;t shed and is comfortable to hold in my hand.  I have used it for about a month and it still looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dry brushing my skin for a year so far and my skin feels and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;I had to get a new brush because the old one is lost and so I tried this one which is ok but a little rougher than I&#x27;m used too. O well it gets the job done. ^_~</li>
    <li> I always wait and use the product before I review it. I had this brush for quite sometime and this little guy is amazing. It has held up in the shower, bath, and without water. I try to dry brush every other day. I did notice my skin is softer and smoother. Money well spent!</li>
    <li> First, for the money, I am happy with Earth Therapeutics Purest Palm Body brush.  Okay, you see some hesitation, but ask yourself if that hesitation with apply to you.  I am 70 years old, and trying to do everything possible to preserve my youthful appearance, after all I do have children ages 5 and 8.  Also, I have arthritic wrists, and herein lies the problem.  Given with a longer handle, the torque on said wrist would be minimal, I now experience pain trying to minimize the rotation of my wrist.  Also, I simply cannot reach the most central area of my back.  There you have it!  It is a perfectly good brush with some limitations that may only apply to those with similar conditions as described.</li>
    <li> I like this brush. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks. It&#x27;s a bit coarse, but I&#x27;m used to it now and like the feeling. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helping my skin or not. I have bad veins in my legs and carry a lot of fluid. I am hoping dry brushing will help get my lymphatic system working better.</li>
    <li> This brush lives up to my expectation.  Very sturdy and exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This brush feels terrific on the skin.  Makes your body come alive. You can feel the circulation all over when you use the brush.  I can&#x27;t say much about the softening since I don&#x27;t really remember it everyday but I have noticed it ends my legs from itching when I wear tights in the cold weather.  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t believe it will last very long and I don&#x27;t like buying something like this very often.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and I use it every other day.  The bristles do not shed and I am pretty rough with it.  It still looks brand new.</li>
    <li> Does a good job w/ skin brushing.  It&#x27;s easy to hold, like the string on handle to hang it up.  It&#x27;s not too big, perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> I was looking to purchase a body brush and I&#x27;m so glad that I chose this one! It&#x27;s the best body brush ever! It&#x27;s soft, yet firm and contours to the body perfectly! To top it all off, the price is excellent! I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> when it gets wet it just whimps out.  bristles fall out.  okay for dry brush but not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Shrivles up quite a bit after washing, but it still gets the job done, even with heavy use. BristlesD aren&#x27;t hard enough unless you scrub hard.</li>
    <li> I like this I&#x27;m kinda a tough woman skin wise even so I thought this would hurt but it doesn&#x27;t and leaves me all tingly and wakes me up before I shower love it</li>
    <li> Excellent brush, is not itchy or too firm. Great price.</li>
    <li> nice firm bristles that are not too soft, the round head and 360 degree angle of the bristles makes hitting all those odd spots easy since you don&#x27;t have to have any particular surface turned appropriately. I haven&#x27;t&#x27; tried washing it, since they recommend using it before you shower I imagine it may get grotty after a bit, but I&#x27;ll update once I find that necessary.</li>
    <li> Great body brush. I find it much more comfortable to use than the ones that are handheld and oval.</li>
    <li> First off, this is a lot smaller than I thought it looked in the picture. It says 9 inches which I guess it is, but in my mind that was bigger. First use I thought I made a mistake. It is rough, it is scratchy. After a few uses though I&#x27;m use to it. Now I actually think it feels good, and it definitely makes my smooth skin. It&#x27;s also great as a back scratcher!</li>
    <li> I love this little brush. I would give it five stars if it weren&#x27;t for the glue all over the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great little brush, though.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely helps with my circulation and my skin quality.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this in the shower and it has replaced my loofah.&lt;br /&gt;It still gets off all the dead skin, and I&#x27;m sure it would probably work better for that if I also used it dry, but I prefer to use it wet.</li>
    <li> Yes...it looks like a toilet brush but it is definitely not too stiff.  Like any body brush...you have to go very light over the areas where your skin is more sensitive (like your chest area).  I am very happy I purchased this...does the job and its easy to us.  I don&#x27;t use it wet...I use it for dry brushing my skin.  I brush my skin all over (brushing in the direction towards the heart from various parts of the body) to help exfoliate my skin and improve circulation.  I find it to be very relaxing...and I am thankful that I need not apply pressure in order for the gentle exfoliation to happen.</li>
    <li> So I got this brush for body brushing, to stimulate the lymphatic system you brush from the bottom up towards the heart and when you&#x27;re done you feel so relaxed and tingly it&#x27;s amazing!!! The bristles are perfectly rough enough for the skin, not too soft and not to stiff. It&#x27;s also good for exfoliating before the shower. Makes my skin baby soft :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this as much as I thought I would, I have no results when using the brush.</li>
    <li> What a great product.  Leave skin feeling smooth and rejuvenated.  I&#x27;ll be ordering this as a gift and I know it will be well received.</li>
    <li> I have an autoimmune skin condition called lichen planus. I have a couple really bad patches of it and I also have it in my arm pits. I have been dry brushing and using all natural deodorant stone now for a couple months. I do not know if it is a combination of the deodorant stone and the dry brushing but my lichen planus in my armpits is all but gone and my patches elsewhere are noticeably better. I almost wonder if I should dry brush and then try the deodorant stone on all effected areas. ??? Anyhow it is not a cure or whatever and I am not a doc I am just saying it helped me. The brush was scratchy at first and my skin felt sensitive BUT it is  supposedly good for your lymph system and good for your skin. I also noticed the cellulite on my thighs is not as pronounced. So I continue to dry brush before every shower in the direction toward my heart and I will continue to do so. This brush ha a nice handle and good firm but flexible bristles. I recommend for newbies. Start your shower and get in. Get your feet wet and start by brushing your damp feet. It will soften bristles a little. then just brush up your legs and go from there. After a few days you will be use to it.</li>
    <li> This does help with my skin when it itches.  I like it and wish it was more extensive , far reaching.  It sheds bits of itself,  where you see bits of straw here, there.  No problem.  It is not quite ALL I need, but ....  I&#x27;ve found a thing: seems to be a very hard sponge or loofa thing attached to a handle.  (I have an invention in mind...I&#x27;ll ask my son if he will help ---  yes  it is related to scrubbing/itching)</li>
    <li> I use this brush for dry brushing before I shower. It is nice and coarse, which is a plus for me since I like very coarse bristles on my shower brushes, but it may be a little too coarse if you have sensitive skin. As some other reviewers have noted, it shed a little at first but stopped after about a week of use. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and it hasn&#x27;t yet needed to be replaced - this longevity may be due to the fact that I never use it wet, which would most likely wear it out more quickly. In my experience, it&#x27;s a little too soft for exfoliation purposes in &amp;#34;high traffic&amp;#34; areas such as my feet (where a pumice stone works much better) but since that&#x27;s not the purpose for which I bought it, it doesn&#x27;t detract from its overall usefulness for me. Tip: it makes a great back scratcher in a pinch!</li>
    <li> Really like this brush. Not too stiff. It&#x27;s lasting well. Some customers mentioned bristles falling out. I haven&#x27;t experienced that problem. I would buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Since I purchased this brush and started using it I haven&#x27;t had to use near as much body lotion on my arms and legs.  I love the way I feel after I use - it really does stimulate circulation.</li>
    <li> Good quality item, low price, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This brush is quite hard and I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use it in the shower but I do use it on my body dry to get any dark or dead skin off.  It works like a charm!! The first time I used it, I just had to get it and it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s ever done what this does---love it!!</li>
    <li> Been using this brush for one year now and I bought 4 this time so I can give it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Ideal for daily dry brushing--just enough. I have owned several and keep buying them. think you are safe with this choice</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really had this long enough to say much about how it&#x27;s going to hold up, but the dry brushing experience was awesome! I&#x27;ve had an interest in dry brushing for a while, and decided to try it. I live in an area of the country with extremely hard water, and due to heat, one can sometimes smell the chlorine used to purify it. This makes my skin REALLY dry, so I decided to try this brush to alleviate the flakies. I used the brush in the recommended patterns over my body, for about 7 or 8 minutes total, then hopped in the shower. WOW, it made a difference! I could feel the silky texture of my skin while washing, and after I dried and applied lotion, my skin felt smooth, absorbed the lotion quickly, and didn&#x27;t look dried out, even hours later. I&#x27;m going to continue this every day, and see what happens. From initial experience, I expect miracles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to quality of the brush, this is what earned it the 4 stars rather than 5. There are bristles sticking out of the wrapped part which I had to cut off, and to my surprise, there is a plastic cap on the wrapped end. I think it&#x27;s a bit of a junker, but for the money, I&#x27;m willing to continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t intend to get it wet except to clean it, so I think it will hold up for a while, but I will be a little more cautious when I do have to replace it, and won&#x27;t buy this particular brush again.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to but I&#x27;ve found it gets misshapen pretty quickly. Not my best amazon purchase.</li>
    <li> great!!!!!!!!!!! for dry brushing skin</li>
    <li> love using this brush.  It was reasonably priced and a good starter brush for someone new to body brushing.  very stimulating!</li>
    <li> I cant even open ridged bottlecaps without the skin on my hands getting damaged so I was worried about finding a dry brush. Hopefully with this review anyone else with similar hesitations will not put off trying this wonderful and refreshing practise. I can only use it once a week, twice if you are very gentle but it makes shaving last ages. when paired with a good hydration routine for the skin I have had no problems with irritation or bumps with my very sensitive skin. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Really like this body brush, skin feels great after using it.</li>
    <li> This brush does work good but not like it used to be. The material has changed and I feel like it is not brushing me but merely going over my body. The knot on the top keeps wanting to loosen up. I might have to get a different brush next time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit rough,&lt;br /&gt;It scratched up my skin pretty bad, Now I put lotion on and it burns! A good idea overall though,&lt;br /&gt;My skin did feel softer and I feel like it&#x27;s easier to shave now that I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It was my first time using it and I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing! This is a great brush, But for first time users. BE GENTLE! Go in circular motions, and putting on a thin layer of coconut oil will help ( a couple hours in advance)</li>
    <li> Not a very good product.  Mold started growing after one week</li>
    <li> It is awesome! Living in Co can be a little rough on the skin. Using this brush ensures beautiful, soft and touchable skin. I love it.</li>
    <li> It seems well made and feels very good.  So good I now want one with a longer handle to reach my back.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for my morning &#x27;dry brush&#x27; routine!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first dry brush, and i purchased it after seeing all the good reviews. I must say the 1st time using it my skin was hurting from it because of the hard bristles. They&#x27;re NOT soft! After a while of keep on using it, I got use to it and it&#x27;s not too painful any more. Nonetheless, I hope there are better products out there. I will keep using this for a while, but will be looking for something softer.</li>
    <li> Good quality but it didn&#x27;t come with any instructions. I have to get on the internet to figure out how exactly use it.</li>
    <li> I brush this all over my skin before I take a shower. It makes my skin so smooth. This bristles are pretty scratchy, though, so if you have sensitive skin you might want to get a brush that&#x27;s a little softer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend doing much besides a quick shower but with the brush it is just the right texture for me to do a quick little brushing before hopping in.  I would recommend it to anyone who is busy but wants to take a little extra time for themselves.</li>
    <li> So cheap, and works really well. I brush after I work out so I&#x27;m usually all sweaty when I use it but it stays clean (at least I think it is) and it doesn&#x27;t smell. Really helps with circulation and makes my skin soft too.</li>
    <li> Which makes me sad, it seemed so good!  I like it, but the mold from moisture makes it a poor choice :(</li>
    <li> This is a great brush, for dry brushing in the morning!  It is not too rough, the bristles are just right.</li>
    <li> Brush was exactly what I was looking for...good quality also. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> nice feel but the handle is short for my hand and the brush head could be longer.</li>
    <li> Love this as a dry skin remover before I hop in the shower. I really like the feel, not too hard and not too soft. just perfect!</li>
    <li> I hope when I get it, It is Realty Good!</li>
    <li> I bought this for dry skin brushing. I&#x27;ve didn&#x27;t keep up with dry skin brushing in the past because I bought one of those long handle brushes and just didn&#x27;t like the ergonomics of it, I guess is the only way to describe it. This is so must more comfortable in my hand and the length is just perfect without having an unnecessary long handle.&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer said they couldn&#x27;t reach the middle of their back and told us they were were 5&#x27;7 and 6&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know what height has to do with it, but I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; and I can reach that difficult spot between the shoulderblades with this. (I&#x27;m not skinny or extremely limber either!)&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer said, my skin got really itchy after dry brushing. I figured that was natural and part of the process - I looked it up and discovered it just means my skin is really dry. As I continue to improve my health with more live hydrating foods, and daily brushing, I have seen my skin get so soft and healthier feeling -)back to the way is was before being in my early 50&#x27;s!). Actually after first dry brushing it was really soft as it is taking off the rough dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;Everything I&#x27;ve read about dry skin brushing says you have to give it time to get used to it and then you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;Its true and with the perfect size of this brush I finally get to love dry skin brushing.</li>
    <li> I love srubbing my body during bathing and showering keeps my skin color even and  very invigorating.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really more like 2.5 stars…I bought it because I didn&#x27;t want to spend to much money on a brush you are suppose to get ride of after a month. It did the job and was not too ruff nor too soft, however there are random sharp strands which leave a decent scratch. That was frustrating, because you never knew when it was going to happen nor were. I plan to look for a little better brush next time.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for dry skin brushing.  This particular brush was recommended on a web site about skin brushing and I am glad I heeded the advice.  It gives a wonderful brushing...not too stiff and not too soft.  It feels GREAT!  I am now hooked on skin brushing.  It satisfies the itch and does a good job of brushing off dry skin.  I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this item for about a year now and it has held up really well to frequent use and cleaning.  The hanging loop is great, hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles, and if I needed to I would purchase this same item again.  It was a nice addition to my spa themed bathroom!</li>
    <li> Well, I just rated the foot brush as the body brush, but they are both quality brushes, very inexpensive, and look like they will last a good long time.  I love the way the foot brush feels on my feet (maybe someone can switch these reviews around?)  Anyway, I would recommend this brush to a friend for sure.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE DRY BRUSH BECAUSE IT MAKE MY SKIN FEEEL SILKY SOFT, WISH SOMEBODY CAN BRUSH IT FOR ME CAUSE ITS A LOT OF HARD WORK BUT I STILL LIKE THE WAY IT MAKE ME FEEL</li>
    <li> I really love this brush. I use it to dry brush my body before showering. It leaves me feeling fresh, invigorated, soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! I got it for maintenance and prevention of ezcema flare ups. I used it to keep skin clean and free from build up. It makes a difference brings extra circulation to the skin which can lead to easy detoxing, removal of dead skin cells, and better absorption of moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Well let me start by saying that I love the body brush! It&#x27;s a really good quality brush. Nice firm bristles, doesn&#x27;t shed much. On the down side it took FOREVER for me to get it! About a month! It got lost somehow and I had to reorder and then it still took a long time which is the only reason for the three stars.</li>
    <li> I love this brush...I use it for skin brushing and it&#x27;s working out great! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is the only body scrubber I will purchase for removal and exfoliation of my skin. It&#x27;s very helpful for people with acne prone skin to exfoliate their skin. I find this is the best tool for such a job.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it the bristles were falling off. This one does not seem well made.</li>
    <li> I use this every night before showering in my bikini area because I get waxed on a regular basis and it keeps hairs from being ingrown.</li>
    <li> i bought this because i came across an article about body brushing and the health benefits of it... plus i&#x27;m losing weight so i figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt if it could naturally help tighten my skin and soften it. its not too hard but not too soft... its just perfect for skin brushing! i used it while i was in the shower... it worked ok but i think it works better dry. its cheap and works great! after a few days of using this my skin has become noticeably softer and i haven&#x27;t used lotion since starting skin brushing :)    on a side note... i bought this from nutricity and the shipping was ridiculous. i order this item on jan 12 and didn&#x27;t recieve it til jan 29 when i was suppose to recieve it jan 18-28. i will never order from this company again because of this. i have never had a product take so long. i emailed them 4 times asking when my product would be here and they never responded back. i tried calling them and they have an automated system and tell you that they will respond within 24 hours which never happened.</li>
    <li> I believe this really does aid in circulation. I used to have issues of feeling \\&quot;itchy\\&quot; aftet showering and running\jogging etc... But since I&#x27;ve been drybrushing it doesn&#x27;t seem to happen anymore.. Also alternating from cold to hot water on my legs also helped the \\&quot;itchy\\&quot; feeling on my legs after shower... I would definitley reccomend this product :-)</li>
    <li> Love it, however, it does not explain that you should use it only in strokes towards your heart.</li>
    <li> I have Renaud&#x27;s Syndrome and use this on my feet and ankles, after soaking, to improve circulation. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or scratch.</li>
    <li> Nice for dry brushing to remove toxins.</li>
    <li> Amazing Brush and I love the way it feels on my skin. Its kind of addicting. I really love the brush I couldn&#x27;t have ask for anything more. Thank You</li>
    <li> Mracle brush!!! its soo good, i finally feel my skin clean and gives you an instant brush massage, your skin feels pampered</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll loose some bristles but it makes your skin so soft</li>
    <li> I really gave this a try.. and I do not have sensitive skin. This one left scratches all over and I kept trying it hoping I would get use to it. But in the end I purchased the Fantasea natural bristle brush which was a nicer combination of soft yet mildly abrasive.</li>
    <li> Great skin brush: gentle enough to not damage skin but also invigorating.  Makes me feel pretty great, and though I haven&#x27;t yet gotten religious with using it, I think that I have noticed some improvement in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> Dry-brushing was a new concept to me, but this brush fits the bill. Not too soft or too rough. It does lose a few bristles, but there are plenty to go around. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> this is a little too rough on my skin.</li>
    <li> Really nice brush at a great price.- leaves your skin smooth too!</li>
    <li> I love this thing!! I had a baby and my body isnt quite the same so i have been using this everyday and i have to wash the tub out later on that day because i can actually see the dead skin!!! So that tells me how great it works :) very happy with this product, my skin is so soft!</li>
    <li> the first few times i used it it was too rough but now it&#x27;s a little softer and i use it before every shower, dry in a circular motion from my feet up. i&#x27;ve noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I preferred the older model. The current one sheds all over!! not very use-able</li>
    <li> Really wanted to like this more, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to be like one review said, it feels like you&#x27;re brushing your body with a toilet brush.</li>
    <li> I had always heard that dry skin brushing before a shower had many benefits.  I ordered this brush just to try it out.  Little did I know how wonderful it would feel.  It stimulates my skin and leaves it really smooth after the shower.  What I like the best is that my skin does not feel itchy since I started dry brushing.  I could not be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try dry brushing after I&#x27;d read about the benefits. I ordered this brush upon the recommendation of a blogger that I follow. It is good quality in its construction. The handle is easy to hold on to and the length is good, but the bristles were actually too hard/rough for me to use. I was preggers at the time, so it could be that my skin was just extra sensitive. I&#x27;ve been too busy with my new twins to try it again. Maybe the more it is used, the softer it becomes. And. . . I could just be a wimp. :D</li>
    <li> Has held up well to skin brushing, which is my I bought it. Has a good feel in the hands and the bristles are firm. good for slow strokes, but not recommended for vigorous use, or senstive skin.</li>
    <li> WHen I can remember to use this before I get in the shower I feel like I really can tell a difference in the smoothness of my skin.  But I usually forget  to use it :(</li>
    <li> I use this brush 3x a week with my favorite body wash.... your skin feels clean and silky afterwards</li>
    <li> I like this brush.  Dr Oz talked about dry brushing, so I decided to give it a try.  It is easy to use.  Before a shower, you basically start at your toes and brush gently upwards toward the heart, and then from your hands up and shoulders down to the heart finishing with a circular motion around the belly.  It helps the lymph system circulate better.  I lost a pound of weight and it stayed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushing is softer than loofah scrubbing.  It took a couple of brushings to get used to, but now it is second nature and I dry brush every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is well constructed from natural material.  You will probably need to replace it every two months because it gets dirty.</li>
    <li> This brush is vegan, so no animals were harmed for the bristles. I appreciate that.  It is perfect for dry brushing, and while I understand it could also be used in the shower, I prefer to keep it just for the dry work.  Since I received it, my skin has really benefitted from the increased circulation, massage and gentle exfoliation. It is smoother and softer and looks better. That&#x27;s a good thing, especially with winter&#x27;s drying effects. Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with dry brushing so I can&#x27;t compare this to any other products I will say it might be too intense for some. The stiff natural bristles leave my skin feeling invigorated and soft. I love the design with the handle, makes it easy to reach even the middle of my back. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for a Dry Body Brush and based on the reviews that I read on Amazon, I decided to try it out.    Its new, but so far I&#x27;m quite happy.  The bristles are not too rough or overly firm, but still provide enough stimulation to do the job.   Its made by Earth Therapeutics, so you know its made well.  I don&#x27;t see how this could be used wet because it just doesn&#x27;t seem like its made for that purpose....that&#x27;s where a loofah would come in handy.   But for dry brushing, this seems to be just about perfect.</li>
    <li> Dry brushing is an excellent way to exfoliate before showering and this brush does a wonderful job! It has lasted longer than expected. Would definitely reorder!</li>
    <li> This brush is exactly what I wanted for dry brushing.  The quality is great, much better than I expected for this price.</li>
    <li> This brush is just the right size for dry brushing. Easy to hold and maneuver. The bristles are reasonably soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin. It doesn&#x27;t shed bristles and is well made. I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST body scrub brush ever. I wish they had a version on a longer handle as a back scrub brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me loves me some of that... Bring it on home to me now!&lt;br /&gt;I live at the corner of Easy Street &amp; Lucky Charms in the City of Love.</li>
    <li> I love dry brushing it makes your sink feel so soft.</li>
    <li> Very nice,  holds up well!</li>
    <li> Good buy for drybrushing, natural bristles and the right amount of firmness. Will be inexpensive enough to replave as needed.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this brush three times and it works well. It&#x27;s not too rough but not too soft. A few of the fibers will fall off so you&#x27;ll need to sweep up or vacuum up after dry brushing. If you have difficulty reaching all areas of your body, get one with a longer handle. This brush does the job for me.  I plan to reorder this product.</li>
    <li> While skeptical about the lymphatic and cellulite claims, I love what this does to my skin. Easy and pleasant to use, immediate results.</li>
    <li> A little bulky but totally does the job</li>
    <li> Works as expected and I use it prior to getting into my infrared sauna to remove any loose/dead skin cells.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Great for dry brushing before the shower!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality, wonderful body brush for circulation</li>
    <li> I love this brush!!!! I use it sporadically before a shower or seaweed wrap. I really feel like it makes a difference in my skin texture.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to help with a detox regime that I am doing. Dry-brushing daily before my showers. I don&#x27;t yet know if it is helping, but the brush was inexpensive and the feeling of dry-brushing is nice and invigorating. I don&#x27;t have any experience comparing body brushes but I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  I wanted a body brush and this fits the bill perfectly.  It is soft and not hard on the skin, good for circulation and exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry brushing. Soft enough to not hurt skin, but firm enough to exfoliate skin.</li>
    <li> Bought it for cellulite reduction, but I wasn&#x27;t a daily brusher so I still have cellulite. It&#x27;s great for a pampering your skin and feels wonderful afterwords. My skin felt like it had lotion on it. The products price is great too and I got fast shipping :-)</li>
    <li> Not sure i really know how to dry brush  but it is great quality for the price! I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Do you have rough and bumpy skin? Well look no further...this is the answer to your prayers. I do a brushing right out of the shower (slightly towel-dried) and apply coconut oil and I no longer have chicken skin on the back of my thighs, butt, and upper arms. A lot of people have this problem particularly in places with hard or well water and this brush is a great non-chemical way to treat it. You must use coconut oil though!!! After I apply my oil I use a softer paddle brush  this one--&amp;#62; http://www.amazon.com/Fantasea-Natural-Bristle-Brush-Ounce/dp/B0035RE2TA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1421267609&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;dry+body+brush and my skin is smooth all over.</li>
    <li> A great body brush -- not too abrasive and not too soft. I use it in the shower because it does shed just a little bit, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! at the beginning it was a little harsh to the skin, but not painful. My skin is very soft and invigorated after using it! It&#x27;s a treat to use it every day!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay body brush, but it&#x27;s personally too soft for my tastes.  I prefer a stiffer natural brush.  Made nicely though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this to dry brush. It&#x27;s not too rough and not too soft. I have not had any problems with falling bristols or unraveling.</li>
    <li> Awesome product &amp; seller.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> At first my skin was not used to being brushed, but after about a week, this brush feels awesome!  It is just right....not too soft and not too rough. My skin tingles after being brushed.......I love this brush. Have been using it for months, and no breakage or shedding.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> LOVE this body brush!  This is my first body brush and I enjoy using it dry prior to my daily shower.</li>
    <li> I had one before and because I know of all the benefits I had to have another one and would recommend it to everyone. It is great for your circulation and helps makes your skin softer.</li>
    <li> This is a quality brush and I was happy with the seller.</li>
    <li> ...I was introduced to it as a means of scraping off dead skin cells since there are parts of my body that just sort of accumulate dead skin cells that clog up the pores.  One unusual but highly effective way for me before using this brush was just taking my nails and without using enough force to break the skin simply going over the problem areas, which took the dead skin clean off with minimal irritation.  This brush for me feels far more irritating and doesn&#x27;t do the job any faster, it hits a larger surface area but doesn&#x27;t take the dead skin cells off as effectively, and personally I think it feels quite uncomfortable.  I really don&#x27;t see the point in it.</li>
    <li> this brush was exactly what i wanted in a dry brush. the bristles were not to abrassive and made my skin feel great.the handle was long enough to reach every where it needs to.  i used it to dry brush every morning and so far my skin feeels very silky and smooth. the brush is very affordable and the delivery was timely. i would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is something you must check into further if your looking at this!!  Dry Brushing your skin has amazing results!  I am so glad I stumbled upon it online!</li>
    <li> I started dry-brushing my skin before the shower after I read one of the detox books. This brush works really well on my sensitive skin - not too coarse and not too soft. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because when I used it in the water the handle darkened - mold? - and I had to throw it away and buy a new one.</li>
    <li> i love this brush. it was a part of my birthday gift basket. i received a few more body skin care products as well as cellulite products. it works great as dry skin brushing tool. after that i apply my anti cellulite cream and its been about 2 weeks and let me tell you, i am happy with what i see. very minimal effort with maximum results.</li>
    <li> Product as represented. Good service. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I never dry brushed before until I ordered this product.  I was afraid it may be too rough on my skin, but it was the perfect texture.  It feels great on my back!  I now dry brush everyday and I do feel that it does an excellent job with blood circulation and exfoliating.  It&#x27;s a good jump start to my day!  It seems like a sturdy brush that would last a long time too.</li>
    <li> Imagine one of those shredded wheat cereal squares:  smelling wonderful, great texture, lovely natural color.  Now... imagine soaking it in warm water for a few moments.  What will you have left?  This brush is what you will have left... a soggy, flat, limp, shedding mess.  A total waste of money and time.  Frustrated, I threw it away.  A week later, Amazon wrote me an email and wanted my feedback.  When I gave feeback, they told me my comment would not be shown because they only wanted feedback on the customer service and not the product.  I called Amazon Customer Service and then asked for a refund.  After the standard 12 minutes and 46 seconds on hold with jangling piano music loudly playing in my ear, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I would receive a full refund! I rarely ask for refunds because the time,hassle and frustration involved is often not worth it.  Wow! I&#x27;m stunned that this had a positive outcome and am going to sit here on my sofa for a few moments and take it all in.</li>
    <li> Love this. Use it a few times per week in the shower. Exfoliates well without being too abrasive. I&#x27;ve used this before applying a self tanning lotion and it keeps me from getting dark patches. Seems to dry out well too when hung out of the water stream. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good product, just what the cleanse book called for.</li>
    <li> I have used this brush for dry brushing my skin before showering and doing a homemade sugar scrub. I have also used it in the shower, to scrub everywhere, including my back (I&#x27;m petite, so the short handle doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it might be harder for someone with longer limbs and torso to use as a back scrubber.) Dry brushing helps the circulation, which helps distribute blood to the skin, and of course makes skin healthier. Using it in the shower gives a nice, gentle exfoliation, especially when paired with a gentle body cleanser. I do recommend that you do not store this brush in your shower, so that it won&#x27;t develop bacteria. I also sterilize brushes, etc, that I use on my skin, and even my toothbrush. So perhaps a bit of a &amp;#34;germaphobe.&amp;#34; ;)</li>
    <li> I really like this brush.</li>
    <li> I love this!  My only problem is that the handle kind of hurts my hand when I hold it, because of the bristle things sticking out on the bottom of it.  But maybe there&#x27;s no other way to design it.</li>
    <li> Body brushing turns out to be a very important daily health routine. It eliminates toxins from the body and invigorates the skin. This body brush is very light, making it easy to use. The bristles aren&#x27;t too firm, and they&#x27;re nice and clean. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it wet, although the instructions indicate that you can do so. It&#x27;s perfect for dry-brushing, and the brush is attractive and pleasant enough that you won&#x27;t mind seeing it every day.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect... takes a little to get used to and I don&#x27;t use it every time but this gives your skin a very vigorous cleaning... and very well made too!</li>
    <li> I have now opened the package and while I appreciate this product being made by natural fibres, it is very course. But the one I was using before was too soft and I did not see any results of decreased cellulite which I was mainly aiming for (It did improve blood circulation). So il just have to try it for a while and hopefully get accustom to it in hopes of seeing some great results. I will be buying a pack of 3 to share with my family to start practising dry brushing as it does increase circulation and has alot of good benefits.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for scrubbing off the dead skin! Recommend buying from Earth Theraeutics - they were the best price, fast service, and I didn&#x27;t even have to pay shipping.</li>
    <li> For a newbie at dry brushing, this product fits the bill.  It helps me reach my back and doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on my skin.  I have already seen a difference in the appearance of my skin in only a week.</li>
    <li> I love this body brush.  My skin has never been healthier.  Dry brushing is addicting and great for your skin! Gentle yet does the job.  I use it every day and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this body brush.  The bristles are very firm, but not hard.  It&#x27;s easy to handle and works great!  I&#x27;ve had 4 body brushes to date; this is the best one I&#x27;ve owned.  I will definitely purchase another when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I use this as a dry brush.  The bristles are very stiff yet fine, so light pressure is enough pressure even for me (and I love pressure).  There were no strange smells, and it did not shed much in the first few days of use.</li>
    <li> i love this brush! it definitely helps my super dry skin. however, even though i have dry skin it is still VERY sensitive so i usually don&#x27;t use this brush before i shave (more irritation) and also i found if i use it every day before my shower my soap will burn my legs. i have found that if i use the brush twice a week, it is the perfect combination with my dry skin. i can tell a HUGE improvement not only in the texture but also i have found that when i use on my hips (stretch marks!) it has definitely made my skin smoother! i love it! :)</li>
    <li> I have owned about three of these brushes, and overall love them.  I LOVE a good back scratch, and this brush delivers.  The bristles are quite stiff and it is very invigorating.  This brush is not for you if you don&#x27;t like a good scratching!  My one complaint about the brush is that the roping on the handle has eventually come undone on each of the brushes I have owned.  It is frustrating as I have yet to find a brush that feels as good as this one.  So, buy it knowing that the handle will fall apart.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this are coarser than I expected.  It&#x27;s my first skin brush, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to, but it feels a little too abrasive on the more sensitive areas of skin (behind knees, stomach, inner thighs).  Perhaps other skin brushes are even more abrasive, though, and this one is comparatively soft.  I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I had read up on body  brushing and was intrigued by the benefits described.  There are a number of body brush types and styles, but with no experience, I ordered this one based on the reviews.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  The brush isn&#x27;t too stiff or too soft.  It washes up nicely.  I have experienced very little of the shedding others mentioned, but perhaps that&#x27;s because I use it as a dry brush before a shower rather than a wet brush in the shower, and then wash it weekly.  Only difficulty is the hard to reach areas on my back so I may augment it with a back brush.</li>
    <li> I got into dry brushing several months ago. I had just started epilating and I read that dry brushing helps prevent ingrown hairs. Going into it with this expectation alone, I was highly surprised and pleased with how many benefits I achieve from dry brushing. My skin feels so much softer and looks healthier, especially now during the winter months. Brushing in the morning before I shower makes me feel so awake and rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two brushes and this is the stiffer of the two. I use a softer brush for my midsection and upper arms but this brush is perfect for my lower arms, legs and feet. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the \\&quot;toilet brush\\&quot; shape and the handle could be better (see customer images for a close-up) but this brush has held up well and works as it should. For the price it has been a great brush and I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I use it just before showers as a dry brush, while standing in the shower.  It&#x27;s great for circulation and for keeping the skin soft by dry brushing dead skin cells off and promoting skin renewal.  It is a good size and easy to handle.  Also, if you&#x27;ve got an itch, this will definitely take care of it!  :)</li>
    <li> falls apart everywhere.</li>
    <li> great for dry brushing. i read a blog about dry brushing and it recommended this  brush specifically. Works great and esy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> Great body brush! It is well made for the price!</li>
    <li> Perfectly rough, and very durable</li>
    <li> i love this product and recieved the product earlier then the date given me!!  very happy with this company.</li>
    <li> Brush is well made and works great, shipping was fast thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for dry brushing. It is super stiff and bristles take some getting used to. But does the job. If you are looking to start dry brushing, and you dont have auper sensitive skin, this works well.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin brushing. Originally seen reviews on Youtube, and decided to purchase after doing the 10-day smoothie cleanse. I have only used a few days, but have noticed a significant difference in my skin. My skin is softer and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and priced right. Got a few as gifts that i gave along with a brief description, history, and instructions on how to use to simulate lymph flow.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this brush! It isn&#x27;t too tuff on your skin where you get super red from dry brushing. I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> this brush does great for dry scrubbing and in the shower. I rinse and let it air dry after each use though.</li>
    <li> I ordered this body brush because the one I have doesn&#x27;t have a handle.  It arrived quicky and is perfect for dry body brushing - it&#x27;s not too rough like some others and the handle makes it easier to use.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made.  The handle part completely unravels, and the hanging part kind of comes lose.  Cheap.  HOWEVER...I must say I do LOVE the bristles.  They are very effective, and have been the only I have ever used that actually leave my skin feeling truly exfoliated.  Maybe if you just used dry, on dry skin before showering it would last longer (which I hear is better anyway).  OR...perhaps they make a more expensive one that would last when wet.  either way, am keeping until it completely falls apart and then would actually consider getting another one.  Just know it is not expensive so all in all, a good buy for what it does.</li>
    <li> I think the brush does what it says it should, but it is put together a bit oddly.  Arrived as stated.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a present for my wife and he hasn&#x27;t stopped thanking me.  I can&#x27;t comment on how it works, but it must do a good job.</li>
    <li> This is my first dry brush so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot in case I didn&#x27;t like it.  For the money spent, I am very happy with it and have actually ordered another one as a gfit.  It isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin and it&#x27;s long enough to reach everyplace.  It shed a little when I first used it, but not excessively.  Haven&#x27;t tried to clean it yet, but since it is so inexpensive I can just order another. Good product for the money spent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush. This is my first dry body brush and so far I am loving it. I do skip days every once in a while because I like to do it in the morning but I am such a snoozer, but I wish I could do it every day because it feels sooo good. A nice daily body brush.</li>
    <li> My husband has a problem with always having a itchy back and can never find anything scratchy enough to do the job. He LOVES this. Good size and scracthes away all the dry skin causing the itch!  Great for dry brushing!</li>
    <li> I was expecting the picture however, when the product came the package was broke and the handle was hanging out. Then I noticed that the handles binding was loose and it does not cover the whole handle. However, it is a nice brush but next time i will get mine from bbb.  Also, I would suggest to you to ship it in something bigger so this won&#x27;t happen to anybody else.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates really well and very quickly. Scrub yourself before you shower and you&#x27;re all set. :) I&#x27;m not sure if it gets rid of cellulite or not, as I don&#x27;t currently have a problem with it.</li>
    <li> Spread the word, we all need to practice dry brushing. Just completed a 21 day Purification program that recommended dry brushing before taking a shower.  It is very invigorating and stimulating.</li>
    <li> A one time purchase for sure. I was disappointed in the product really wished I just went to the store or the body shop to find something else I would have used.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush as I experiement with dry skin brushing.  I must admit this makes my skin feel alive and healthy.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for dry brushing. I have been using this for 2 weeks now and have already noticed a relief in my dry skin - much softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> This brush is used to improve circulation, but it also gets rid of dead skiin and makes you feel smooth and &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34;.  I used it once before a shower and I&#x27;ve been hooked on it ever since.  Great feeling - kind of wakes up your whole body.  Use it on your feet - makes them happy too.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had for very long so I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up. It works well. Very stiff, takes getting used to but it&#x27;s useable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to remember to use this brush every day. Not only for the lymphatic system, but also to help prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy. So far, it&#x27;s really helped, and not I won&#x27;t go a day without using it! :)</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed.</li>
    <li> The idea of dry brushing was recommended to me by a friend for stimulating my lymphatic system after a recent surgery. It took a bit of getting used to the stiff feel of the bristles, but after a month of daily use, right before my shower, I believe it is just right for the job intended. I would not use it near an incision but it is invigorating elsewhere and leaves my skin tingly and  smooth, ready to shower and start the day.</li>
    <li> Bristles are just right (not too rough). This is my 1st time brushing and this is easy and great. Smooth skin results! Good value for the price. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It is a good soothing skin brush for removing old skin cells and also providing a relaxing skin massage.</li>
    <li> This brush is a little scratchy at first, but i think you really need to get used to the feel of this daily ritual. after a while it feels great on  your skin. I&#x27;m not sure if i believe all the health benefits related to this, but it sure does make my skin softer</li>
    <li> This seems to be great. Cant think of any reason why you would not want to try this on your body!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush back in 2012 and have since bought four more. I use it for dry brushing and have since had major results with reducing cellulite and my skin is soft as ever!</li>
    <li> This brush has pretty much eliminated all the red bumps on my legs.  it looks super scratchy but its not painful- strong and stiff enough to be effective but not so rough that it would take the whole top layer of skin off lol.  i use it every day and am very impressed with the results</li>
    <li> This is the first brush I have ever purchased for dry brushing, so I am only rating it for dry brushing and not when used with water. It definitely takes some getting used to, but if you can push through the mild discomfort of first-time dry brushing with this, you can start to see a difference on the skin. I use one side for my body and the other for my face. I don&#x27;t really recommend this for your face for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. If you aren&#x27;t very gentle the first few times, you can hurt yourself. These bristles are just not meant for your face. Prickly!&lt;br /&gt;2. The brush is kind of large so working with the contours of your face can be a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;I got used to it, but at first you might freak out a bit by the feeling. I&#x27;m mostly using it to see if it gets rid of my Keratosis Pilaris, by the way.</li>
    <li> I would have liked a stiffer brush.  The Coconut foot brush was the right stiffness but too small for dry brushing the entire body.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and delivery were fast and on time and the brush will be a good present for my adult kids just starting to dry brush.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these as gifts and this is what we have learned&lt;br /&gt;1. the handle is very scratchy and itchy&lt;br /&gt;2. if used in the shower it molds VERY quickly (even when cleaned up after each use)&lt;br /&gt;3. does NOT reach the center of the average back (we are 5&#x27;7&#x27; and 6\\&quot; tall)&lt;br /&gt;4. works well for \\&quot;drybrushing\\&quot; although must be done by someone else on your back and results have been mixed&lt;br /&gt;5. my elderly pops skin broke open even with light gentle brushing&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL; not worth your money, buy the 3 pack loofa&#x27;s on Amazon and a long handle</li>
    <li> Love this brush and would buy this again when the one I have is worn out. Bristols don&#x27;t bend back and am able to apply any amount of pressure on my skin without damaging the brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many body brushes before and this one has the roughness I had been looking for. I really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Love this dry skin brush! I have sensitive skin and it works very well.</li>
    <li> really cheap quality for the price..</li>
    <li> Nice body brush, I can already feel a difference in my skin. Some dry areas are now softer. I use this for dry brushing. I love to brush just before my shower of bath. I come out feeling silky smooth all over.&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is tightly woven and fairly well made. It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great for detox brushing before an Infrared Heat sauna treatment. Works, skin feels soft not scratched, but still vigorously brushes. Great buy, and was a good first experience with dry brushing.</li>
    <li> Great brush dry or wet. Great price for the brush. I use it with soap or salt scrub.  No problem with mildew if you hang outside shower</li>
    <li> Very little loss of bristles- great scrubby texture!  I&#x27;ve used it dry, but I think I&#x27;ll be using my extra in the shower too.</li>
    <li> This brush is constructed well and has held up for me for several months of use. Do not soak this, do not use this in the shower. It is for dry brushing. I will purchase this brand again when the one I have wears out, however, I do not think this will happen any time soon.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin silky and smooth.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Its really great to get the circulation going in the morning. Actually, I use it both morning and night. The product is a quality product and is  holding up well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for dry body brushing to help with detoxifymg my body.  I have only used it a couple of times so I am judging it based on shipping, quality, and also appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the brush very quickly. I was pleasantly surprised.  The brush did shed a bit as I pulled from the bag.  I had read other reviews and people had stated it sheds a bit at first so I took it over my garbage can and ran my fingers over it to let go of any loose bristles.  I did my first dry brushing standing in the shower before I turned on the water.  I did not notice any shedding.  That may be because I got it all out over the trash can or because my tub is a light color, like the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is comfortable in my hand and doesnt poke me with the fibers like a few others had complained.  It seems well made and it is easy to use. Mi d wish the bristles were a little softer, like natural bore bristles but this is made from vegetable fiber, so I cannot expect it to be as soft.  I prefer that this doesn&#x27;t come from an animal source.  I had read in other reviews that at first it may seem sharp and stiff but after a time of using it your skin gets used to it.  I only find it a little painful on my stomach.  I did notice light scratches on my shins, but nothing deep.  Just very superficial.  I do also find it invigorating!  Four starts because I wish it was a bit softer.</li>
    <li> I was constantly buying exfoliators for my skin- especially my legs. Nothing ever worked long term, and I would pile on the lotion after a shower and I would still have dry skin. Dry body brushing has changed all of that! I use it before the shower and have noticed nice smooth skin for days now. I will be using it longer to see if it helps with circulation and any cellulite. I am so glad I found this product and will no longer have to buy body scrubs!</li>
    <li> I got this last year for my husband and he loved it. It was lost traveling a couple weeks ago. This is an exact replacement for it, as he wanted the same brush, not the one with a handle like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only *minor* complaint we have with this brush is the slightly rough fiber handle. He cut a piece of rubber shelf liner to wrap once around the handle &amp; put three rubberbands, around the top, center and bottom of the liner. That makes a very nice handle and holds well. This does wonders for his skin, and is probably part of the reason the scar from his total knee replacement is so flat and faint.  He highly recommends this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before anyone asks, he used it above and below the knee as soon as *the Surgeon &amp; Physical Therapist said it would be okay*, which helped circulation to the leg, then *when the Doc and Therapist said it was healed enough* he used it very lightly on the knee, gradually adding pressure as it healed more.</li>
    <li> These densely packed bristles are ideal for dry brushing. I have other body brushes that are too soft of too stiff, but these are just right. Maybe it&#x27;s the length of the bristles that allow a sweep, I don&#x27;t know but I LIKE a LOT. Very pleased and will order again.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels when I brush before showering.  This brush has stiff bristles, but doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin.</li>
    <li> I really love the brush and has make my skin feel amazing. My only complaint (it&#x27;s personal preferance, nothing to do with the products quality) but I&#x27;d like if the brush with more course.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for dry brushing.  It works well.  It&#x27;s the right size and the right firmness.  I do not find the fibers on the handle to cause discomfort.  If anything, I find it aiding the dry brushing process.  I would highly recommend this brush if you plan on starting dry brushing.</li>
    <li> This dry skin brush works well and exfoliates my skin. I use a spa regularly for pain which dries my skin out and this makes my skin feel better.</li>
    <li> I love this brush for dry skin brushing. It is very stiff so it is good for people that have started with a soft brush and want to go a step further.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush. I use it as a dry brush and It feels REALLY nice on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying some as gifts!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. I only wish that the handle was longer so I could reach better. It also sheds the bristles a little bit</li>
    <li> It is rough but i removes the dead skin. I love it. I wish i found it earlier. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have bought a lot of bath items and this is a favorite!</li>
    <li> I use this for dry brushing and it works really well. Bristles are stiff but not too harsh. I would use it in the shower the first few times for dry brushing because the bristles fall off at first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy this brush for almost a year, last time it didn&#x27;t make it to my last apartment due to the weird address. I used it the other day to take off my dry winter skin on my legs and applied the coconut oil moisturizer I make and my legs were so soft I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With any body brush you skin has to get used to being brushed and you may have to start out softly brushing. I&#x27;ve been using a softer face brush for a year and my face can tolerate this new brush.</li>
    <li> This is  the best body brush I have ever tried.  Whether you plan to use it on dry or wet it does the job well without losing bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I actually had to order 2 more since the whole family was claiming the rights over the first one.  Also, unlike most brushes I know, this one has an excellent grip whether your hand is soapy or not.&lt;br /&gt;This company did very well as seller, too.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> What can I say about this brush?  Ummm....it&#x27;s simply amazing!  It feels so good on my skin!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice. No need for a washcloth!</li>
    <li> The perfect body brush.  Just what I order just as described. Love it! Will use it daily. Will buy another when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> Great price and brush, pretty harsh though - but no pain - no gain.  leaves skin feeling soft!</li>
    <li> Yeah, not so great.  Lost it&#x27;s fluffy texture fast. I&#x27;d rather have a loufa - will be tossing this soon.</li>
    <li> The bristles are not so firm that they hurt, but they do a great job of brushing off the dead skin.  It is a good quality skin brush and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love the firmness of this brus.  It&#x27;s not too stiff, but not too soft.  I use it for dry skin brushing to help with daily detoxing and exfoliating.</li>
    <li> I just started looking into body brushing a month ago, and tried to do research on finding a good/right brush. I am very happy with this brush, when I am in need for a replacement I will buy this same one again. I am very happy with the seller as well.</li>
    <li> This is a fine firm bristled brush to use on your feet for dry skin brushing. It&#x27;s a little weird shaped, but no trouble with it so far. Too prickly of a bristle to use anywhere else on my body though.</li>
    <li> This would be a great brush, but there are tiny bristles on the handle that poke into your hand and hurt.</li>
    <li> The brush will make tiny scratches on your skin, but nothing major. It is a good size to handle and work around the body. The problem is that after using (only used once) I had a pretty bad rash on my chest and face. I guess is a common sense that is too harsh for face and neck area. Or it may had cause that because dry brushing open the pores of our skin and I used a heavy moisturizer right after shower.</li>
    <li> I like the small size, and the bristles are soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.  It rinses clean easily, and quickly dries.</li>
    <li> I love this brush for dry brushing. I&#x27;ve always had very soft skin, but this brush increased my skin&#x27;s softness. I was very surprised. Affordable item with a great reward. Brush may lose a few bristles, but it&#x27;s a good brush. Don&#x27;t worry. Worth your money. Used mine over a month now and it&#x27;s holding up nicely. Looks like new.</li>
    <li> I know this is purchased to rid bodies of cellulite bumps (just stop eating McDonalds and go for a run), but the brush is great for removing dead skin. My arms and legs feel smooth and my body butter absorbs a little bit better on fresh skin.</li>
    <li> This brush feels great.  I use it before I go to bed every night.  I just love it and I will buy again when this one gives out.</li>
    <li> Great dry brush. I use it to exfoliate in the bath.</li>
    <li> This little brush is the best.  I have used the brush dry and wet.  Currently, I am using it in the bath daily and guess what?  For the first winter in my life that I am able to remember, I don&#x27;t have dry and flaky skin on my legs.  My skin care products seem to soak in much more quickly and now they also seem to work.  If I need to, I will repurchase the brush.  I really don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I Love this product. It is my Favorite skin brush. Great gift for people. Will continue purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the best body brush I have had ever, all other ones from the health stores are not pure, they are made out acrilic or some kind of plastic</li>
    <li> I have started brushing my body with the brush before my shower and really like it. I am unsure if it is really helping with cellulite, but it does exfoliate my skin especially around the thighs which makes my skin smoother to the touch and helps absorb moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and I love the price too. I used it daily and my skin is soft and beatiful. I take care of my diet and I drink a lot of water too. I use it for no more than 10 or 15 minutes. It is perfect for my dry brushing and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great body brush.  Wish I would remember to use it more often, but my hectic schedule does not diminish the value of this brush.</li>
    <li> This had made my skin so soft again.  It makes my skin feel young again.</li>
    <li> I went online to look at how to do dry skin brushing since there are no instructions with the brush itself.  When reading at what brush to select, the site stated the brush should be stiff, but not too stiff.  Then it stated that if you can pull some bristles out that it is not a good brush.  I also read the the brush will probably soften in about 6 months, so you will need to replace it.  This brush is wonderful!  The bristles did not come out when I gave them a yank in different places.  It is stiff and I&#x27;m not used to doing this, so it was a little scratchy, but not too harsh.  I just go over my skin without applying too much pressure. Not to sound gross, but I did see some dead skin fly in the air, but that&#x27;s what this product is supposed to do. I hope they do not discontinue making this brush, because I will keep purchasing from this seller and this brush.  I love it and recommend that you buy it.</li>
    <li> I love this little baby.  I read an article about &amp;#34;dry brushing&amp;#34; and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  But I have 2 problems - my skin is really sensitive &amp; I am super ticklish.  I&#x27;ve gotten cheap &#x27;back scrubber&#x27; brushes before &amp; couldn&#x27;t stand the pain.  But one of the &#x27;earthy&#x27; websites I was reading linked to this brush, so I thought the price was good enough to take a chance.  If it worked, great; if it was painful, no big loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is perfect for my skin.  It feels SO good to brush along my arms &amp; legs.  I haven&#x27;t done the whole body brushing thing yet, but it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m either in a hurry, or in a &amp;#34;I&#x27;m just gonna kick back&amp;#34; mode.  But I know when I do, this will be the best brush I could use.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this brush! I love it soo much I will never use a lofa again. Its sturdy, and it exfoliates my entire body. The handle is also long enough to reach my back. The bristles are firm, but not too harsh on my skin. This is definitely an excellent bargain with a low price. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This body brush sheds a little every time I use it, but the fibers do not compress. This gets constant use in the shower.  Worth buying!</li>
    <li> Love this brush, although it sheds a little. The bristles are sturdy, the overall quality is very good. I like the feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better for exfoliating than those cheap nylon scrubbies. This brush will last a long time with care. I let it dry thoroughly between use.</li>
    <li> I think that this is a great product to use as an exfoliate for your body you can use it wet or dry. I have not used this product as much as I thought that I would but when using it I can tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to skin brushing by an Arabic woman I conversed with at the doctors office. I figured lets see what its about. I opted for this one due to reviews and nearly 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;I cant compare and contrast being that its my 1st brush. However, this brush is ergonomical, economical, the bristles are not hard at all. They feel nice on the skin. More toward the softer side. Yes, it does shed a few bristles when brushing, but natural fibers like this are expected to. No big deal. Get it, its inexpensive</li>
    <li> First time dry brushing, and i love this brush, i don&#x27;t think i will try another one when the time comes to replace this. I&#x27;ll just order a new one.</li>
    <li> Dry brushing is great for detoxing, increasing energy, skin toning and cellulite reduction. I love the Earth Therapeutics brush and use it every morning before my morning shower. I&#x27;m a health coach and recommend dry brushing to my clients. For more info, visit www.behealthyhappywhole.com.</li>
    <li> I use this brush every day, it feels wonderful on my skin. Took a little bit of getting used to at first but now I am hooked. Great product, highly recommend</li>
    <li> Excellent dry body brush. Leaves skin smooth . Highly recommend .</li>
    <li> Great brush. I was new to this, but I really enjoy doing it when I remember... :-}</li>
    <li> This body brush is everything I was looking for. Well crafted, firm bristles, comfortable handle, scent-free. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! I use it every day before hopping into the shower.</li>
    <li> This brush is truly a gem!  Great on dry skin before bath and to exfoliate while bathing.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> it does hurt a little bit at first.  But I wasted $12 on a softer, bath type brush, and ended up throwing it away because it wasn&#x27;t effective.  This does what it is supposed to, and for half the price I paid for the softer brush.</li>
    <li> Once I started going to school to get my Master Herbal Certification,&lt;br /&gt;they mentioned skin brushing, and in my attempt to have more&lt;br /&gt;healthy, less dry skin with less ingrown hairs on my legs, and to&lt;br /&gt;get my lymph glands to empty, I bought this all natural skin brush.&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers noted, it took my skin some warming&lt;br /&gt;up to this brush, but after a gentle cleanse with warm water, black soap, tea&lt;br /&gt;tree and lavender oils, it became soft enough for me to use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did my legs&#x27; alligator skin diminish, but my skin kinda started&lt;br /&gt;to &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and people kept asking me what I was using. (I also went on a high&lt;br /&gt;raw vegan diet with plenty of green juice, which is the main helper here).&lt;br /&gt;My acne started to clear more quickly, and blackheads went away without&lt;br /&gt;the need to squeeze them. (Ugh, I know!)&lt;br /&gt;***WARNING***&lt;br /&gt;***GRAPHIC DETAILS AHEAD*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same morning after I used this brush before bed, my bowel&lt;br /&gt;movement was completely covered in yellow, thick, gooey mucous!&lt;br /&gt;EEWWW! Day after day, I started to expel more and more mucous, which I had never&lt;br /&gt; experienced in my life before using this brush. Well, at least I know it actually does&lt;br /&gt; help those lymph glands&lt;br /&gt;to get rid of the gunk that&#x27;s stuck in there, although I do my best to break&lt;br /&gt;a good sweat and exercise 3-4 times a week. Better OUT than IN I told myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this ever since and I feel a lot better. My body craves the brushing now.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is a great brush! The design is lightweight and comfortable, with a handle that&#x27;s easy to grip. You can use it both wet and dry, however I have found that its works best and most comfortably on sensitive areas when it is wet. Not only does it stimulate the skin but I have also noticed a lot fewer ingrown leg hairs and a must softer, longer lasting shave.</li>
    <li> Great quality brush for a great great price. I realize that my cellulite  isn&#x27;t going to disappear overnight but this brush does help. I&#x27;ve been using it along with the slim extreme cream and I&#x27;m noticing results after three weeks. It&#x27;s not too hard and not too soft and I have to say I like it :)</li>
    <li> Recieved it super fast in the mail, less than 48 hours I think! That&#x27;s awesome, but the brush is CRAZY ROUGH! It leaves little scratches all over my skin. not severe or anything, and my skin is not really sensitive at all. So far it makes me cringe to use it, doesn&#x27;t feel that great but I will keep at it! Also I read that it&#x27;s kind of driectional, so if you go in the same direction of the bristles, then it feels better? Who knows, maybe I was going in the wrong direction.</li>
    <li> I love this brush for dry brushing. It sheds a little, but not enough to bother me, and it gets the job done. The bristles are pretty stiff, but not painfully so.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliating brush. I mean if your looking for something extremely coarse and large enough to do your whole body. I haven&#x27;t used it that much yet, but I have used it wet and find it a bit more tolerable in water then as a dry exfoliating brush. So far no real complaints besides it kinda looking like a toilet bowl cleaning brush. lol</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by the benefits I read about dry brushing, so I tried this brush. I was disappointed that using this brush actually made me itchy instead.</li>
    <li> this is for the health purpose of body brushing and i love this one because it is a bit softer than the other one I bought and it is small</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended dry brushing prior to my epsom salt baths to help my body detox from Lyme disease. This brush hurts. The best thing I can compare it to is rubbing your skin with a brillo pad, minus the blue residue. Regardless of the pain though, it really works! My skin is smoother than it has ever been, and the pain becomes tolerable the more often you use it. No pain no gain, and in the case of this product the pain is absolutely worth it!</li>
    <li> I am really loving this body brush and wish I had bought it sooner.  I bought it to replace my older one that was too soft.  This one has the perfect roughness and it very easy to manage as it is flexible.  I also love how it looks. It is very easy to clean (just rinse and hang dry).  Most importantly,  my skin is so smooth and soft.  It is a lovely ritual to indulge in, in the mornings that ends with a generous application of scented body oil or pure coconut oil.  I just have to remember to use it every day as sometimes I forget or become a bit too lazy.  The results are worth a daily use.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing for dry brushing!  Just stifff enough and just the right size for brushing all over.  I like that the handle is short so its convenient to store.  The bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out at all even with vigorous scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a day and my skin has never looked better, especially on my legs!  I am 9 months pregnant and my midwife recommended body brushing to improve circulation on the backs of my legs as I am prone to spider veins and aching legs.  This gives me great results and also seems to have diminished the appearance of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;For under $8, this brush is a steal and the quality is just the same as a $30+ dollar brush.  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This is a great body brush.  I recently read an article on dry body brushing and this brush looked like a good choice.  It&#x27;s not too soft and not too hard and the handle is just the right length to reach feet and back easily.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several days now and am very happy with the results.  Buy yourself a nice natural body butter or massage oil to smooth on afterwards (Body Shop butters are my fav).  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  Is is the perfect size, comfortable to hold, easy on the skin while not being too soft.  It&#x27;s holding up well, but I only use it to dry brush. You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price and quality!</li>
    <li> great product. It does what is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Works fine and has held up well.</li>
    <li> I love this for DRY brushing my skin to clean the lymph system.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. I use it every morning before I shower. It is good for stimulating the skin and blood vessels. My skin is smoother.</li>
    <li> Use it almost every day for dry brushing... would definitely recommend it...</li>
    <li> Very well made. Great service from the company. Now to just remem to keep using it :)</li>
    <li> I can see a cloud of dead skin when I use on my legs, it does its job! Feels very nice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as stiff and hard as some people mentioned.  I think it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> sheds, but works great!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! it is amazing at exfoliating and leaves my skin so soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> This does the job.  I was disappointed by the plastic on it, and it&#x27;s not superb quality, but is certainly adequate.</li>
    <li> Look and feel is good, bristles are just right, the materials are genuine fiber not synthetic, the shape and size are great, and there has not really been any shedding.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Im using it every day. Its feels really good after you brush you skin with this. Some bristle falls of  while you brush but its ok. I bought a different brand first but when i saw how many good reviews this one has, i was tempted to get one so i bought it too and im very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like that this brush has bristles on both sides.  The one draw back is that the handle also has some bristles poking out which sometimes make it hard to hold.  If it wasn&#x27;t for that I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and don&#x27;t find any bristles falling out.</li>
    <li> Nice brush, but sheds a bit the first few times. I use it for dry brushing and it works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for dry bushing and really like it. Easy to use and my skin seems to be reaping the benefits.</li>
    <li> This brush feels like you are accomplishing something, not to harsh or too soft. I recommend this brush for improvement in skin and health</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush twice daily (a.m. &amp; p.m) for exactly one month now.  I can truly tell a difference/diminishing of the cellulite on my thighs in the past month.  The softness and smoothness of my skin alone was worth the purchase.  I feel energized, yet relaxed with each use.  I would absolutely recommend this if someone is interested in the benefits of dry brushing.</li>
    <li> What I liked about this is that it&#x27;s handy ( pun intended). It doesn&#x27;t quit feel 100 percent natural but it gets the job done well, once you brush the skin gently! It&#x27;s firm and tough, but does leave a great feel!</li>
    <li> Best brush possible... I replace the brush every few months so I keep many on hand..  Give as gift in health and wellness workshops at my yoga studio when we teach dry brushing.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. At first I thought it was a little rough on my skin--but my skins feels so alive after I brush with it It does take a little getting used to.</li>
    <li> I bought my first one  over a year ago to use it in the shower but I wanted to use a dry brush too, since this works as both, I recently bought another just to use outside the shower.</li>
    <li> Great for dry brushing! My skin is super soft.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I wanted.  I look forward to using it every day to make me skin glow.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by Wellness Mama.  I love it!  My skin is glowing and smooth!  Superbly wonderful!</li>
    <li> Would be better if the handle was somewhat longer,so I could reach my back!  The texture of the brush is perfect.</li>
    <li> It makes bathing a joyful experience and your body feels newly finished.  You almost do not need lotion on your body</li>
    <li> This feels amazing on my skin. Great quality</li>
    <li> This is the second brush we have purchased and it works great! It seems as though roughly every two months it needs to be replaced and as long as it keeps working we will be back to by more. My wife has seen a great improvement in her skin from using this brush.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I had a shower... beauty night or stress relief day without this brush! I read somewhere that a dry brush can help with circulation, fat redistribution and of course exfoliation... this brush helps me to do all of that! I use the brush to massage cellulite on my legs and stomach (pushing toward my lymph nodes), and along with exercise and diet have noticed CONSIDERABLE difference in cellulite.  It has also helped to define my butt, which has been one of my goals.  Also, the exfoliation properties are just phenomenal... you can actually watch all of the dead cells flying off and your skin feels incredibly soft afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one of those people that enjoy &amp;#34;spa time&amp;#34; as the form of &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34; and have loved adding this dry brush to my &amp;#34;me time.&amp;#34; Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Very functional body brush. I enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this brush at all. It is to rough to use on a body. I tried to use it as a cleaning scrubber but it was no good for that either. I just trashed it.</li>
    <li> The handle molded within a few days of us beginning to use it.  Really disappointing :(</li>
    <li> Works great and feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; price. Plus fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is the first body brush I&#x27;ve ever used but I have enjoyed it so far.  The bristles aren&#x27;t so hard that they hurt but they&#x27;re rough enough to know they&#x27;re working.  No complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. It&#x27;s not too hard or too soft. I feel like my skin is glowing thanks to this brush and a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this brush almost every day and my skin feels so much softer and smoother since I&#x27;ve been using it. It also has a very calming effect on me when I perform the routine of brushing my skin. It&#x27;s especially nice to use the brush just before a bath (as recommended).</li>
    <li> This is the first I ever tried for dry brushing.  Chose this one because it said it could be used wet or dry,  I use it dry, and it sure is great for scratching an itch!</li>
    <li> Read about dry brushing and its benefits. Its been a month since I started using this product. It works great and i am seeing an improvement in my skin. A great addition to your bathroom essential kit.</li>
    <li> When I first received the brush, I was a little apprehensive.  It looks like it may be painful to drag across your skin!  Now I look forward to using it before I bathe or shower.  It feels wonderful and I feel so much cleaner sloughing off any excess dead skin cells and lotion build up.</li>
    <li> I use this for my dry brushing and it appears to be working.  Bristles are firm but not painful against the skin.</li>
    <li> My doctor reminded me that skin is the largest organ of the body.  I starting using this and the rough patches at my elbows disappear.  Skin looks better already and it just feels good.  Don&#x27;t wait so long, like I did.  Buy this great brush and take care of your skin</li>
    <li> I am somewhat disappointed with the lack of sturdiness and size of this brush.  In the picture, the handle appears sturdy and tough, and it seemed to be a big brush.  When it arrived, I brushed it against my arm, the handle flexed and the brush seemed too small for my liking.  The bristles aren&#x27;t as stiff as I like either.  It seems lacking for the $9.00 I paid for it.  I bought this brush to replace a Salux type wash towel in the shower as the wash towel does not exfoliate well.  This brush is almost too short to reach my mid to upper back and because of the handle being so flexible, it doesn&#x27;t seem to scrub well.  I will not use this brush in the shower even though it states that it can be used dry or wet, it seems like it would fall apart or be much softer.  It does do well for dry brushing as the large amount of bristles give a nice swish to the skin and enhance circulation, except on my mid to upper back.  It seemed to ship fast.</li>
    <li> The bristles are natural and not too soft, not too firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to dry brush in a circular motion right before putting on body lotion at night.  I love it. So far it has held up well.  Maybe I need to replace after 18-24 months at the rate it is holding up so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great addition to your skin routine to maintain healthy skin.</li>
    <li> This is the first body brush I have purchased, so far so good.  It does get a bit scratchy if a person pushes too hard.  I do like the way my skin feels after use!</li>
    <li> I use it every day before I take a shower it works great you would love it helps get your blood runing</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been trying dry brushing for a couple weeks, and no immediate results yet, but i like the exfoliating feeling you get from it, and it means i have to use body wash/scrubs less. since it&#x27;s summer my eczema has calmed down, so no news yet on if this brush will help with that. but a combination of this brush, the occasional thorough body scrub and generous lotion application (i use st. ives naturally smooth body lotion which is cheap and one of the best lotions i&#x27;ve found), my summer skin is very calm and smooth.</li>
    <li> Use this with an oil on my less then desirable rear and back of legs. Works great with the oil I use.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and the darn brush is light and easy to handle and very effective. Natural as they come and certaqinkly priced right.. Cant lose.</li>
    <li> I bought this for exfoliating my feet and face ;but it does seem a little harsh for the face. Works fine on the feets</li>
    <li> This is great for dry brushing. The only way they could improve it is to make the handle a little longer, but it&#x27;s still great.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry brushing.</li>
    <li> I use this for dry brushing for my stretch marks and so far it has tremendously paid off!! Serious results and if you commit and stick to it for at least 4 weeks I swear you will see a difference. Probably not it&#x27;s intended use but that&#x27;s what I use it for. :)</li>
    <li> PEFECT!!!  I love this great body brush!!</li>
    <li> Just as shown. I think it&#x27;s a great dry brushing brush. Great experience with Earth Therapeutics.</li>
    <li> For dry skin brushing. And, as I prefer a more stimulating brushing experience, the bristles are jus the right strength for me.</li>
    <li> Hey some people found this to be hard, I think it was just the right tool for the job. I like to enjoy exfoliated smooth skin so this is just right. It really is not that hard I think some over exaggerate and yes it clearly looks like a toilet cleaner but who really cares, if it does what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for dry brushing before the shower. I have found it to be to abrasive for dry brushing.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush.  I like this brush.  Eleven more words required.  Seven more words required. Three more words required.  COMPLETE</li>
    <li> Material kind of got weak after a few months for me. End up tossing it.</li>
    <li> This exfoliating gives you softer, smoother skin. I recommend using it daily. Lightly!</li>
    <li> I must have gotten a bad one or something. Very few of the bristles stick outwards. They lay flat or are mostly sideways, so it isn&#x27;t so much a brush as a pile of fibers. Overall not as pictured and not useful.&lt;br /&gt;When I do try to use it (dry,) it is very dusty. It isn&#x27;t clear if this is dead skin or if it is coming off of the fibers. Either way it seems pretty messy and gross.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a similar brush at Marshall&#x27;s for cheaper that looked much better.&lt;br /&gt;A last note on dry brushing, if I were to purchase another brush I would get the flat back one sided kind, getting the right angles or any pressure is awkward using the handle.</li>
    <li> I use this for skin brushing and it is exactly what I expected. It is stiff bristled but that is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this brush, just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Pleased with this brush. When comparing prices of this brush to others with similar quality I was very pleased with the pricing as well. I just received it about ten days ago, so I will know more about it with use.</li>
    <li> A great way to pamper yourself. I really do feel my circulation increase after regular use of this product.</li>
    <li> I have owned about 3 different loofah type body scrubbers. I personally like the long handled ones.  Well each and everyone looses its handle in various ways.  This one is perfect.  Nothing to fall apart.  Perfect little loop that I use to hang up in the shower to dry when I am done. You will luv luv luv!</li>
    <li> Even if there were no other health benefits to dry brushing I would still do it because it feels AMAZING! This is a great little brush; it is a manageable size, not too big.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I like that it&#x27;s firm but not so stiff it leaves marks. Good product!! Especially for the price!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect body wash brush. The skin feels inmediatelly super soft</li>
    <li> Feels invigorating on my skin; although not sure if it&#x27;s actually making my skin softer thus far, but seems to have a more therapeutic effect (my skin feels tingly after I use it which makes me think it&#x27;s really getting my blood flowing).</li>
    <li> It takes a couple of times to get used to the scratchiness, and you must go light with it to avoid actual scratches but this thing feels incredible.  I always feel so invigorated and my skin is a lot smoother in just one week of use.  Great for exfoliating before shaving.</li>
    <li> Arrived much faster than expected.  A nice product that I&#x27;m using for dry brushing, but the bristles are just a touch stiffer/scratchier than I&#x27;d prefer.  Still using it, though, and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> My wife and I loved this brush.I have psoriasis and it really helped on the appearance of it.And my wife&#x27;s skin is so soft !!! The package came before that we expected,great customer service.</li>
    <li> I just started skin brushing...and this thing really works...it invigorates my skin and sloughs off the old stuff, I recommend...</li>
    <li> I use this brush for dry brushing and it works perfectly! I would recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> I go this to treat scaling skin around my knees and elbows. I tried it wet. It really didn&#x27;t work well wet. I started using it dry for a couple of minutes after each shower. It does help. But it is really slow process.</li>
    <li> I like it, but the bristles shed.</li>
    <li> Works best when dry , too soft if wet</li>
    <li> I read so many great things about dry brushing your skin, so I thought I would try it out! I love doing it before I take a shower. The first time I used the brush the bristles were a little rough, but after a few uses, it was perfect. It only takes a few minutes and it feels great afterwards!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for dry brushing your body. Loving it very much.  Easy to use. Isn&#x27;t to rough. Perfect.</li>
    <li> The bristles are rough yet not enough to cause irritation. After dry skin brushing, it leaves my skin so soft! It was one of the best beauty investments I have made.</li>
    <li> I use this type of brush for dry body brushing from time to time, and it is pretty effective.  The bristles are on the stiff/scratchy side but are not harsh enough to cause skin damage.  It does tend to shed when it is new, but most of the loose bristles are out after the first use.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice dry brush for under $10. A note to anyone who&#x27;s never dry-brushed before -- it will feel a little \\&quot;rough\\&quot; and uncomfortable at first. So don&#x27;t expect this to feel like you&#x27;re rubbing a fluffy kitten on your skin. There is a roughness to it. You want to brush so that your skin feels stimulated but not too much where it starts to feel painful. Let the brush do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only peeve is that it does shed a little bit with the first few uses, as some other reviewers pointed out. You might want to rub the bristles a bit over a trash bin or outside when you first get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very nice brush. It works best when you use it consistently/daily. My skin does feel smoother and softer when I use it regularly. Fewer \\&quot;chicken bumps.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I recently went through months of reflexology for water retention and other issues and the therapist recommended&lt;br /&gt;me get one of these. So I did. I bought this one and I tried it for a week or so and noticed absolutely nothing with my&lt;br /&gt;lymph drainage. I used it before I showered and it made my skin hurt. it was actually painful and my skin seemed drier&lt;br /&gt;and drier on my shins to where I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I can&#x27;t just use any lotion either (allergies) so I couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;take it anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I purchased this brush after reading all the positive reviews about it. My skin was slighlty softer each time I used it before going into the shower, however this is not enough for me to purchase it again in the future or recommend it to firends.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush back in October and have been using it at least 5 days a week, since.  The bristles are firm and natural feeling, some might find it to be a bit harsh at first.  Because the bristles are natural and of course dry, a few rouge bristles can actually scratch your skin as they did with mine, so start out with very gentle strokes.  I have dry and sensitive skin, so I liked the fact that this brush was made of natural materials and provided a more firm brush bristle. I needed a brush that could go deeper in some areas that needed more exfoliation, but also provide a softer and less abrasive brush for more the sensitive areas of my skin.  Although I feel this brush was effective in this manner, I do find that it is bit too abrasive for my chest, neck and abdominal area, so I try my best to apply a light pressure with minimal strokes and sometimes, omit the sensitive areas altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how it feels on my back in the areas that it can reach!........which is the biggest downfall of this brush in my opinion.  I cannot brush my back nearly as effectively as I can everywhere else and my back is one of the areas of my body that needs it the most!  This brush measures 9 inches, but even if you have very long arms which i do not, it is still difficult to get the back area using the appropriate brushing technique.  I have tried bending my arms in front of a mirror in every direction and just cannot get the leverage needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other downfall of this brush is that it gets matted down easily, losing it effectiveness.  I wash mine at least once a week and let it dry in the sun. I use mixture of tea tree essential oil, water and white vinegar which I find the most effective for cleaning. It does restore back to it&#x27;s original state, but mattes back down again after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an absolute body brush convert.  Body brushing alone has single-handedly changed my skin.  My skin is softer, firmer and healthier than it&#x27;s ever been not to mention all the wonderful benefits to the lymphatic system.  I just wish this was longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now ready to order a new brush, but I am going to try one with actual bristles with a longer handle to see how it compares.  I would buy this brush again if was available in longer size or may use is alongside a longer brush.</li>
