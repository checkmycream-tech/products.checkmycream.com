      <li>The original Thai stick doesn&#x27;t do that</li>

      <li>No bad body smell and no stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am always fresh and clean and never have odor.  </li>
      <li>A large on will last many, many years.  </li>
      <li>If you are cleaning up your eating, why would you put chemicals on your skin to be absorbed</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Natural and safe.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent non-perfumed deodorant that lasts a long, long time.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;m allergic to baking soda which is in most natural deodorants</li>
      <li>This does the job, with no irritation, and I believe it to be safe and all natural.</li>
      <li>This deodorant is simple to use, dries very fast, doesn&#x27;t leave stains, and it works better than store bought clinical strength deodorants!</li>
      <li>First after a day without a shower, then within 30 minutes of applying deodorant to even freshly washed armpits.</li>
      <li>I find this just as effective against odor as Dry Idea, but it doesn&#x27;t use perfumes or aluminum.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant Really works!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Assuming I don&#x27;t develop any more sudden allergies, I will continue to use this product with vigor!</li>
      <li>Also, this stick lasts a LONG time-so very economical!</li>
      <li>Is strong enough for man</li>
      <li>RARELY have any odor at all, and I love how &#x27;green&#x27; it is.</li>
      <li>It really makes you not stink without any added scents.</li>
      <li>This never leaves any powdery residue and dries extremely fast.  </li>
      <li>Will absolutely buy again.</li>
      <li>I switched to this about a month ago and find it very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just make sure you wet the stick or the salt will not transfer to your skin.</li>
      <li>Item was well sealed and wrapped and arrived lightening fast.</li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work.</li>
      <li>There is a tiny bit of stickiness when first applied, but it quickly dries.</li>
      <li>I am most concerned with maintaining a fresh scent and this works as well as any other product as far as that aspect of it is concerned.</li>
      <li>I usually make my own deodorant</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even just moved my business into a larger, very hot warehouse setup and although I am sweating profusely, I&#x27;m not stinky.</li>
      <li>After decades of using antiperspirant/deodorant I decided that I don&#x27;t think that stuff is good for you, so I tried several deodorants, only to find that they all (strangely) irritated my pits.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It takes a little getting used to, but seems to work OK.</li>
      <li>I dont recomend this product, I will continue trying to find one natural deodorant that really work</li>
      <li>/&gt;Helpful observances from MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I rarely have to reapply.</li>
      <li>I live in Phoenix</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I am purchasing my second stick, after the first one lasted over a decade (no kidding)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Color me pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>No harsh chemicals!</li>
      <li>Complete garbage do not waste your money, unless you want to stink of course.</li>
      <li>It does not irritate or otherwise break out my increasingly sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;d prefer to eliminate packaging, I found the egg-shaped stone (I was using) slipped and shattered frequently.</li>
      <li>Gets rid of odor and wetness naturally.</li>
      <li>Never annoys my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Works really well for someone who has a problem with underarm odor and is allergic to the perfumes in regular deodorants.  </li>
      <li>that it gently (over a good period of time) &amp;#34;scrubs away dark spots left under your armpits that were left by harsh chemicals from anti-transpirants/deodorants.  </li>
      <li>I want to add that it&#x27;s a real bargain since it goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Get rid of the chemical filled stick deodorants of the past.  </li>
      <li>I live in Phoenix, so this is a big deal!</li>
      <li>I started using the natural deodorant (different brand) during a two-month biking trip through Canada in 2013, and have been using it ever since.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve barely used one quarter of this stick.</li>
      <li>Making it much cheaper than the typical deodorants too.</li>
      <li>I leave the container open to keep the crystal dry and aired.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than the little stones they sell in baskets.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It takes a little getting used to, but seems to work OK. Probably wouldn&#x27;t be a good choice for someone who sweats a lot or works outdoors.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is amazing. The sticks last for at least a year (I get tired of looking at them after a year and get a new one--no idea how long they actually last.) I&#x27;ve been using this product for over three years, and will never go back to regular deodorant. RARELY have any odor at all, and I love how &#x27;green&#x27; it is. No sprays, no stickiness, no smell, no problem. Amazing product, really.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works great!</li>
    <li> Hate the product. It does not work.</li>
    <li> Awesome!, simple, easy and quick to apply and it dries fast leaves no white marks on you or your clothes and best part it really works, I go all day and not one stench of odor. I recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I like it. Small enough for travel, but if you drop it or knock it over, it will break and become unusable. I like it but switched to the liquid form for daily use.</li>
    <li> Wish I had gotten 2!! Love it!! No harsh chemicals! Item was well sealed and wrapped and arrived lightening fast.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s amazing how well it works. I will never go back to regular antiperspirant and deodorant.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but I must say after using this for a few days that it definitely works.  The stick should last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how great this thing works!  Now in fairness, I don&#x27;t sweat a lot, so the lack of antiperspirant wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but I NEVER smell anything--and I check!  I live in Phoenix, so this is a big deal!</li>
    <li> I really like this as it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t have the aluminum that is suspected by some to have bad effects.</li>
    <li> Just for fun, write the purchase date on the bottom of this!  I am purchasing my second stick, after the first one lasted over a decade (no kidding)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product, and it is effective, no scent, no residue etc.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm for my son it&#x27;s very effective!</li>
    <li> I bought a different mineral salt deodorant for my son who was out of the USA for a couple of years, and he said it worked great (it did...I actually smelled the results).  So I decided to find some for the rest of the family and found this brand.  My husband has not tried it yet, but the rest of us have and I am very impressed.  With normal, non-sweaty days, it is amazing.  With moderate sweaty days, it is great.  With a hard, sweaty workout, I am still impressed.  Just make sure you wet the stick or the salt will not transfer to your skin.</li>
    <li> It works and there&#x27;s nothing harmful about it! It does take a little longer to apply than normal deodorant but if you don&#x27;t want bad stuff being absorbed into your body then the extra minute is worth it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to have something natural and that wouldn&#x27;t stick to me like Secret or Dove that was not even keeping dry&lt;br /&gt;This crystal works great!!  I love it</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of deodorant since 4years and is awesome. Is strong enough for man so you get the idea.  One of the great things is that it gently (over a good period of time) &amp;#34;scrubs away dark spots left under your armpits that were left by harsh chemicals from anti-transpirants/deodorants.  What this product does is to kill the bacteria in sweet that causes bad odor.  This stone is made of a mineral rock.  This deodorant, if used daily will last you about 3-4 years and you will notice that it naturally clears your skin from dark spots that might have occurred due to past anti-transpirants or deodorants. Great product.</li>
    <li> After decades of using antiperspirant/deodorant I decided that I don&#x27;t think that stuff is good for you, so I tried several deodorants, only to find that they all (strangely) irritated my pits. This does the job, with no irritation, and I believe it to be safe and all natural. I bought the spray on version too but haven&#x27;t used it yet.  (shower and follow the directions)  Edit: It&#x27;s been a year and I&#x27;ve barely used one quarter of this stick. Seems it will last for years. Making it much cheaper than the typical deodorants too.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how well this crystal stick works, I can see this thing literally lasting years and is the only natural deodorant I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate my armpits and cause an ugly rash. I think I&#x27;m allergic to baking soda which is in most natural deodorants so if you&#x27;re allergic to baking soda I highly recommend this product. It really makes you not stink without any added scents.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with my purchase. This works really great. I&#x27;ve even just moved my business into a larger, very hot warehouse setup and although I am sweating profusely, I&#x27;m not stinky. That&#x27;s as great a recommendation as I can give! Try it, you&#x27;ll like it. I&#x27;m sure my body is appreciating me not poisoning it like I&#x27;ve been doing for years with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has watched my experiment and has now made me order her one to use.</li>
    <li> I started using the natural deodorant (different brand) during a two-month biking trip through Canada in 2013, and have been using it ever since. While I&#x27;d prefer to eliminate packaging, I found the egg-shaped stone (I was using) slipped and shattered frequently. This packaging holds the stone well. There is a tiny bit of stickiness when first applied, but it quickly dries. Never annoys my sensitive skin. Protection lasts forever, as does the stone itself (if you don&#x27;t drop it).</li>
    <li> The best on the market.  The more you use it, the better it works.  This is the only deodorant I have used for years.  A large on will last many, many years.  It does not clog the pours and I use the powder on my body also.  I am always fresh and clean and never have odor.  Get rid of the chemical filled stick deodorants of the past.  The cancer society recommends this also, I understand.  Nothing bad in it.  Much cheaper than the little stones they sell in baskets.  I bought one of those at a health food store and paid 15.00 for it and not half the size of this and worked no better.  Just don&#x27;t drop on a tile floor!</li>
    <li> Please do yourself a favor and try this product out. After using standard deodorants until about the age of 30, I suddenly found myself breaking out into a rash. First after a day without a shower, then within 30 minutes of applying deodorant to even freshly washed armpits. For two years, I struggled with various substitutions until crystal deodorant was suggested to me. I have been using this product for about 9 months now and with amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost: this is NOT AN ANTIPERSPIRANT. It will NOT stop you from sweating. But honestly, is that something you REALLY want? I mean...you sweat for a reason, no?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: This product does not 100% eliminate any and all instances of odor under all circumstances. Let me say this, it works fantastically to control your B/O. However, if you plan on arm-wrestling the simian equivalent of Hulk Hogan in a 33 hour marathon grudge-match, YOU ARE STILL GOING TO STINK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful observances from MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I rarely have to reapply. It dramatically knocks down existing B/O if you are skipping your morning shower. It does not irritate or otherwise break out my increasingly sensitive skin. I have also found it to control irritation after shaving (face &amp; armpits). It performs well in your chubbier areas that may need a bit of help not stinkin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming I don&#x27;t develop any more sudden allergies, I will continue to use this product with vigor!</li>
    <li> Wow! By far the best deodorant I have ever used!  I usually make my own deodorant and I love it, but after a while it starts to leave stains on your clothing. This deodorant is simple to use, dries very fast, doesn&#x27;t leave stains, and it works better than store bought clinical strength deodorants! I am in love!!!</li>
    <li> this stick has the worst odor without even putting it on and putting it on only carried the odor onto my skin. Dont reccommend.</li>
    <li> My wife Loves this deodorant.  Works really well for someone who has a problem with underarm odor and is allergic to the perfumes in regular deodorants.  She has tried other Deodorant stones, but they did not work as well and were sticky.  This never leaves any powdery residue and dries extremely fast.  All you need is water.  Works for me too.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent non-perfumed deodorant that lasts a long, long time. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This deodorant Really works!  I love the fact that there are no chemicals involved.  My daughter, husband and son use this as well.  Also, this stick lasts a LONG time-so very economical!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and after using it once it smells like BO- like how compact it is though.</li>
    <li> It didnt work for me, in a few hours of work, I tried to use it in every way posible, because of the reviews and didnt work, with my experience I dont recomend this product, I will continue trying to find one natural deodorant that really work</li>
    <li> Works pretty well but after awhile starts to smell like onions!!!! The original Thai stick doesn&#x27;t do that but this one was a good buy!!!</li>
    <li> Natural and safe. Doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes and no yucky chemicals that may cause problems like regular deodorant.  If you are cleaning up your eating, why would you put chemicals on your skin to be absorbed</li>
    <li> It works. However, I have to reapply a few times during the day. So, I&#x27;d say it doesn&#x27;t last for too long. But, may be it&#x27;s a good thing... otherwise I would start wondering &amp;#34;what&#x27;s in it... hm?&amp;#34; :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to wipe the moisture off of it after applying. I leave the container open to keep the crystal dry and aired.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t at all. :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few years and they work! You might perspire a little where with an antiperspirant you wouldn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s not going to kill you with chemicals either. I am most concerned with maintaining a fresh scent and this works as well as any other product as far as that aspect of it is concerned.</li>
    <li> never buy a deodorant again. not to mention how much money you could save by cutting out monthly deodorant costs</li>
    <li> I switched to this about a month ago and find it very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Dry Idea for many years, but my early twenties son told me it&#x27;s bad to use deodorants that contain aluminum and that it absorbs through your skin. I won&#x27;t get into a discussion on health effects of aluminum but you can search that on Bing or Google.  It&#x27;s sufficient to say we need our health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son told me he has been using this and recommended it, so I decided to try it. I find this just as effective against odor as Dry Idea, but it doesn&#x27;t use perfumes or aluminum.  Just salts.  It might not keep me quite as dry but the difference isn&#x27;t significant. Plus, there is no perfume smell. No bad body smell and no stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 11/11/2013: Still using this and still very satisfied. I want to add that it&#x27;s a real bargain since it goes a long way. I need to use less than one container per year.</li>
    <li> Will absolutely buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent natural alternative, I work as a commercial roofer and this has eliminated my BO that antiperspirants and deodorants could not after 12 hours on the roof tops of Nashville TN</li>
    <li> I live in Phoenix so I was worried this wouldn&#x27;t cut it. It does though. Color me pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> To me, this is the best type of deodorant. No more smell even after a workout! No more smell at the end of the day! It is great. It even beat Secret which would break down at least by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I don&#x27;t like using aluminum products, so bought this.  My mother used to use somehting like this, and now I know why.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for less than a week and I&#x27;m odor free.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of odor and wetness naturally.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it does not work well for me.  I have gone back to Crystal.</li>
    <li> Complete garbage do not waste your money, unless you want to stink of course.</li>
