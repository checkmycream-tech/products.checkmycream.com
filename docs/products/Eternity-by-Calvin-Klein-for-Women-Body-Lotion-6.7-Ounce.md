    <li> I am very happy with the service I received.  I love this product and was glad to be able to purchase it online.</li>
    <li> I got the lotion because I had bought  a gift set with the lotion in it, and my girl friend really love it.</li>
    <li> The reason I ordered this is because my sister has a bottle of the very same lotion, hers smelled stronger, fresher. Was my order shipped from stock from 5 years ago or something? It&#x27;s not as good a quality as my sisters, and I have to wonder Why?? Because it&#x27;s the exact same name, brand, etc. I am not happy with this order, I feel it may be a knock off put into the Calvin Klein bottle, or possible the stock is so old that the age of it has changed the way it smells. I am very disappointed in this product, I feel cheated.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this product at a local department store and pay more money.  Happy with this purchase.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not so happy...I did not get product That I ordered as pictured here.  Mine was the tube with no pump soooo not pleased at all.  That&#x27;s what I receive with the cologne every time my husband purchases in store.....I like the pump . I probably won&#x27;t try ordering this again.  Not angry at all.....just disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love how clean Calvin Klein Eternity smells with just a light sweetness. Most cologne give me a migraine and this has consistently been good to me. I received this quickly and love it.</li>

I would call this a super value for a fraction of the reatail price at the cosmetic counter. I hesitated at first for fear it was not the real deal but it met all expectations and was delivered in a short time.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s secret weapon in the fight against old age and looking like a million dollars every day.</li>
    <li> Considering the Calvin Klein brand, I would have expected the item to come boxed but alas, no box. I wondered if it was genuine and was relieved it smelled like \\&quot;the real deal\\&quot; or close. I&#x27;m still not 100% convinced but it works; but for that price I&#x27;d rather be sure.</li>
    <li> I live in a small town in Wy. It is 124 miles to the nearest mall. I love the Eternity lotion and was thrilled to be able to buy it outside of gift set.</li>
    <li> The product was just what I was looking for. I gave it for Christmas Gift and she Loved it. I bought one first and got it and liked it so very much I ordered a second and it arrive in perfect time. Great transaction.</li>
    <li> This is what I wanted and came on time just like they said. Very happy on my order and very happy with Top of the world company</li>
