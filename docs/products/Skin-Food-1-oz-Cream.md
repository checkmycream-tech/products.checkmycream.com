<li> It&#x27;s worth spending a little extra money, if I can get a product without those</li>
<li> Most lotions can&#x27;t accomplish that, short of using petroleum jelly or cold cream or something totally greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I understand what people are saying about the smell.  </li>
<li> I actually purchased this product to nourish my dry skin during long-haul flights.  </li>
<li> From diaper rash to stubborn dry hands.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re in search of a creme to keep your skin in check during the harsh winter, look no further.  </li>
<li> not sure why someone in the reviews above spent $50 for a 1oz tube of this.  </li>
<li> I used this on my heels which were EXTREMELY cracked, to the point of what I thought was no return.  </li>
<li> So I&#x27;m not sure what happened there, but obviously pay attention to what size you&#x27;re buying, if you buy it.</li>
<li> Not greasy at all but extremely  emollient.</li>
<li> It keeps my extremely dry skin at bay during the harsh winter.  </li>
<li> I use this as night cream on my face so the slight greasiness doesn&#x27;t bother me during the day</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t find it overpowering, at all, or even noticeable after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not your normal artificial, perfumey smell...</li>
<li> it&#x27;s hard to get the lotion out which causes some waste of the product.</li>
<li> is so hard that towards the end</li>
<li> While it&#x27;s a small tube, the creme is very thick.  </li>
<li> It goes on very thick and seems to stay on well.  </li>
<li> I will never spend money on expensive eye creams again.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> From diaper rash to stubborn dry hands. Forget the steroid creams and get Skin Food. Simply fantastic stuff and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Allergic to the Almond oil.</li>
    <li> Smells yummy and feels really hydrating.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin food using all natural ingredients.  Weleda makes the best beauty products.</li>
    <li> Great product from a wonderful company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fabulous lotion for hands and body!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  It goes on very thick and seems to stay on well.  The tops of my hands get very dry and wrinkly looking, and I find that hours later, my hands still look moisturized and smooth after using this.  Most lotions can&#x27;t accomplish that, short of using petroleum jelly or cold cream or something totally greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I understand what people are saying about the smell.  It&#x27;s not your normal artificial, perfumey smell...it&#x27;s more of a natural plant smell.  Since I&#x27;m used to using essential oils for a lot of purposes, I&#x27;m used to those earthy types of smells.  I don&#x27;t find it overpowering, at all, or even noticeable after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have any parabens, mineral oils, propylene glycol, or any of those junky ingredients that the cheap lotions have.  That&#x27;s a big seller for me these days, since I&#x27;m trying to eliminate all chemicals from my food and body products.  It&#x27;s worth spending a little extra money, if I can get a product without those chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why someone in the reviews above spent $50 for a 1oz tube of this.  Mine was only $12.50 for the 2.5oz.  So I&#x27;m not sure what happened there, but obviously pay attention to what size you&#x27;re buying, if you buy it.</li>
    <li> I use this as night cream on my face so the slight greasiness doesn&#x27;t bother me during the day and it&#x27;s like magic - my skin is so smooth and hydrated in the morning even after I&#x27;ve washed it - I&#x27;ve never been more pleased with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but, for me, this didn&#x27;t work that well. It also has a very strong odor that I didn&#x27;t like. The cream didn&#x27;t seem to absorb well into my skin. I do better with creamier lotions that don&#x27;t have such a strong medicinal smell to them. I didn&#x27;t even like using this on my feet.</li>
    <li> a true feed for the skin.  i have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This stuff squirts out kinda thick and gloppy but rubs in clean and soft. Not greasy at all but extremely  emollient.</li>
    <li> Very rich and moisturizing but the smell prevents me from applying it in public.  It&#x27;s similar to A &amp; D Ointments odor.</li>
    <li> The lotion seems greasy at first but the greasy feeling goes away.  Lotion seems to work well.  The tube it&#x27;s in is so hard that towards the end it&#x27;s hard to get the lotion out which causes some waste of the product.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion for dry skin and especially in dry climates. It protects skin, keeps mositure in and smells great. I like the natural ingredients as well.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this product to nourish my dry skin during long-haul flights.  However, after running out of my beloved FRESH eye cream... I decided to use this cream as a substitute until I had a chance to replace it. I LOVE IT!!!!! I will never spend money on expensive eye creams again.  The consistency of this cream is thick and smooth - perfect combination for the area around my eyes.  My eyes appear more awake (even after an all-night study session) and they are always moisturized without feeling greasy. I highly recommend anyone buying this product to use it as an eye cream. Guaranteed results!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t argue with this being a good moisturizer. But I can&#x27;t do the smell. It kills me.</li>
    <li> I love my tube of Skin Food.  If you&#x27;re in search of a creme to keep your skin in check during the harsh winter, look no further.  It keeps my extremely dry skin at bay during the harsh winter.  While it&#x27;s a small tube, the creme is very thick.  I let it warm up on the back of my hand and then put it on my face etc.,  I also wear it under my make-up and it keeps everything perfect.  No mid-afternoon dryness.  Weleda is a quality product and I will purchase again &amp; again. I would certainly recommend the brand &amp; product to my friends &amp; family.</li>
    <li> I used this on my heels which were EXTREMELY cracked, to the point of what I thought was no return.  After a couple nights of using this before bed, the cracks already started to heal.  After 2 weeks, my heels are smoother than they have ever been.  I am a true believer in this stuff!</li>
    <li> Been using it for two weeks now and works fine. The price is not cheap though for a tube this size but fits well for your purse or if you&#x27;re going on vacation and need to pack light. I might buy this again if there&#x27;s cheaper shipping....</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer but did&#x27;t do justice for my dry feet</li>
