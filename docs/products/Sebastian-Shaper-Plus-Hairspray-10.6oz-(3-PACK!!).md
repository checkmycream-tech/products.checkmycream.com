    <li> There, I said it. I refuse to use cheap stuff. It&#x27;s sticky, it smells bad. Sebastian hairspray is the best, in my humble opinion. And it is often sold out at my local Wegman&#x27;s. I also save money buying it this way. Win-win.</li>
    <li> Hello:&lt;br /&gt;Quality product &amp; on time delivery.&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
    <li> The package came packed very tight and secure. I love this hairspray. It holds my hair in place, especially with our winds in my state. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will not use anything else.</li>
