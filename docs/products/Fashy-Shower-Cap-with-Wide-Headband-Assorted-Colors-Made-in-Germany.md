      <li>I have been looking for the perfect shower cap for a long time.</li>
      <li>The puffy part on top will keep expanding to accommodate any size, and the headband  easily opens to so that you can tuck in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>It is very tight fitting compared to a true shower cap.  </li>
      <li>but it really does and</li>

      <li>wide elastic keeps most water out    </li>
      <li>This item it&#x27;s very snug around the head excellence Shower cap.  </li>
      <li>In fairness to the company that makes them, I didnt contact them or try to return it for a bigger cap because my daughter can wear it and likes using it when she wants to take a quick shower.</li>
      <li>Also the shipping charge (which was in excess of 60% of the too high purchase price) was so high that returning it would have just meant throwing more good money after bad.  </li>

      <li>It is soft and comfortable, and yet it&#x27;s tight enough to seal in your hair from the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>- when you first get this cap, it looks like it doesn&#x27;t stretch open very wide, and you might think it won&#x27;t hold much hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
      <li>I have longish thick hair, and I need one that can expand and fit it all.</li>
      <li>This cap is the only one I have ever had that really keeps hair dry.  </li>
      <li>your hair won&#x27;t stay dry unless it can all fit inside the small cap</li>
      <li>primary complaint about most shower caps is that they are uncomfortable and scratchy around the headband.</li>
      <li>It look like it might not fit when you first get it</li>

<li> I requested a white one and the same size as the pink dot one ordered.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m back to using my plain old plastic caps with the elastic edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barb</li>

<li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re really careful to not bend your head.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s too tight fiting to be a shower cap.  </li>
<li> but it is very small and doesnt hold all of my hair which is very long.</li>

<li> Unless your looking for a swim cap or have very little hair don&#x27;t buy this, look elsewhere.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s WAY too small to be a shower cap.&lt;br</li>
<li> If you have a small head go for it</li>
<li> I could not use this showercap at all because it was too small.</li>
<li> When that one&#x27;s band stretched out I was unable to find a replacement and was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Unfortunately not very stylish.</li>
<li> Can be used in the pool if you don&#x27;t want water splashed on your hair but its not good at swim cap.</li>
<li> /&gt;Basically, this is false advertising.</li>
<li> it stay close to my head without being uncomfortable.</li>
<li> Even some expensive ones have this problem.</li>
<li> Unhappy with this shower cap.  </li>
<li> It works great.for my bad ear.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is just a terrific shower cap. I have been looking for the perfect shower cap for a long time. I have longish thick hair, and I need one that can expand and fit it all. This one does that easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My primary complaint about most shower caps is that they are uncomfortable and scratchy around the headband. Even some expensive ones have this problem. Not so with this shower cap. It is soft and comfortable, and yet it&#x27;s tight enough to seal in your hair from the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note - when you first get this cap, it looks like it doesn&#x27;t stretch open very wide, and you might think it won&#x27;t hold much hair. That isn&#x27;t the case. At first I thought it was for a child, and then I realized that you put this cap on like a bathing cap -  put it on and then tuck your hair inside of it. The puffy part on top will keep expanding to accommodate any size, and the headband  easily opens to so that you can tuck in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> This shower cap is well made but it does not expand as much as it could. For some reason the outer fabric, with the puckered stiches, expands quite a bit. It would even accommodate curlers BUT the inside vinyl waterproof liner DOES NOT expand so you basically have a swim cap for the shower! By the way, this weighs nothing so $7.50 for shipping is rediculous!</li>
    <li> I could not use this showercap at all because it was too small. It did not stretch and I could not put my hair under it.</li>
    <li> This cap does the job, keeps all my hair dry. Unfortunately not very stylish. If they could spruce it up with some color or design that would be awesome.</li>
    <li> By far the best shower cap I have purchased. I just bought my third one (for the gym). Watertight, comfortable and not too goofy looking. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Pro:   wide elastic keeps most water out    Con:   your hair won&#x27;t stay dry unless it can all fit inside the small cap</li>
    <li> I love this shower cap.  I used to get this same cap two in a package from the Vermont Country Store catalogue for about half the price but they no longer offer them.  This cap is the only one I have ever had that really keeps hair dry.  It even washes in the washing machine (air dry) until it starts to get old, then I suggest washing by hand. If you want to get out of the shower with dry hair, this is a must.</li>
    <li> Finally a great shower cap to use with my 10\\&quot; rain showerhead shower. Looks good, feels good, keeps hair dry. Not a China-cheap, plastic cap...what a relief to find a German quality product in a sea of China-made garbage. AAA+++</li>
    <li> I have use this product over an month now...kinda pricey but is worth it(better material). Much better than reguler shower cap. It look like it might not fit when you first get it but it really does and it stay close to my head without being uncomfortable. I got two one for work because I have to shower away from a lot and one for at home..about to get rid of the old shower cap...I know this one is going to hold a whole lot longer than the old ones I have had.</li>
    <li> Most of us girls know the difference between a swim cap and a shower cap and despite the fact that the tag says \\&quot;swim/shower cap\\&quot; there is no way this should be sold as a shower cap.  It&#x27;s too tight fiting to be a shower cap.  Very nice for a swim cap however.  Also the shipping charge (which was in excess of 60% of the too high purchase price) was so high that returning it would have just meant throwing more good money after bad.  Unless your looking for a swim cap or have very little hair don&#x27;t buy this, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s just what I wanted. Keeps water out of my ear.  It works great.for my bad ear.</li>
    <li> Unhappy with this shower cap.  It is marketed as a shower cap, but the packaging states \\&quot;swim cap\\&quot; and that is exactly what it fits like.  It is very tight fitting compared to a true shower cap.  If you want a swim cap, it&#x27;s great, but they are trying to slide it by as a shower cap.</li>
    <li> This is a great shower cap! I have long curly hair that will frizz up if shower between hair washes. Even with my hair up in a clip, the shower cap easily fits.  Simple. The edging is snug, and little to no water gets on my hair even if I push the cap back a little to wash my face.  The best part is that there is no frilly edge!  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This item it&#x27;s very snug around the head excellence Shower cap.  Can be used in the pool if you don&#x27;t want water splashed on your hair but its not good at swim cap.</li>
    <li> This is clearly marked SWIM CAP on the tag that comes attached to the item. It&#x27;s WAY too small to be a shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this is false advertising. Don&#x27;t buy this if you are looking for a shower cap.</li>
    <li> Works great and looks good. I feel like I should be jumping into a pool and performing a routine. Even my husband said it looked classier than those cheap-looking, colorful ones.</li>
    <li> As described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> my wife loves this cap. She wears it to keep her hair dry while taking a shower. would buy it again</li>
    <li> The cap is very nicely made but ordered it because it was to be a large cap.  I have dreads and the cap didn&#x27;t fit  but  I can also use it for guest .</li>
    <li> I was excited to see these....I&#x27;d had one that looked just like them years ago and it had worked really well.  It was covered with a soft nylon fabric.  When that one&#x27;s band stretched out I was unable to find a replacement and was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are covered in a cheap polyester fabric that actually wicks the water under the band....your hair gets soaked for about the first three inches past the band.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re really careful to not bend your head.  It just wicks under.  I feel like I&#x27;d do better with a plastic bag and a rubber band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to using my plain old plastic caps with the elastic edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barb</li>
    <li> Item cost to much and does not fit my head.  It is way to tight. Don&#x27;t buy it.  It is a waste of your money and does not hold all of my hair.</li>
    <li> I requested a white one and the same size as the pink dot one ordered.  I received a RED small.  Again, I can return if need be.</li>
    <li> i would not recoomend it.  this cap is for tiny heads and it just didn&#x27;t fit me.  If you have a small head go for it but it really does fit like a swim cap..</li>
    <li> I have received so many compliments on this cap and they wanted to know where I purchased it. I pay a lot to have my hair colored and this hat keeps the chlorinated water out and I look fabulous!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and had doubts since I have a lot of hair but it goes on nicely and keeps my hair nice and dry.</li>
    <li> This looks very nice and big in the picture but it is very small and doesnt hold all of my hair which is very long. In fairness to the company that makes them, I didnt contact them or try to return it for a bigger cap because my daughter can wear it and likes using it when she wants to take a quick shower. Just make sure that if your hair is long to order a large size if they offer it!</li>
