### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The largest is a perfect blush brush, and the others work well at applying eyeshadow and liner.</li>
      <li>The EcoTools Mini Essentials set is great for all the women on your list this year!</li>
      <li>Great size for purse!</li>
      <li>Great value and great brushes!</li>
      <li>/&gt;As indicated in it’s name, it’s just the essentials and perfect to keep in your purse when you just need a quick freshening up!</li>
      <li>good for carrying in your purse.</li>
      <li>Makes a good stocking stuffer too.</li>
      <li>Items are still good quality though.</li>
      <li>It’s also the perfect size to fit inside a stocking, and sure to be a hit on Christmas morning!</li>
      <li>Cute and great brushes, I got them on sale.  </li>
      <li>I love Ecotools and this is a great mini set.</li>
      <li>good value...cruelty free materials</li>
      <li>Lovely brushes that are easy to hold and have a nice feel.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite brand of brush.  </li>
      <li>but I mostly use cream blush and the ELF stipple brush.</li>
      <li>But still ok, mini size</li>
      <li>The perfect size for keeping in your purse, and the only three brushes I need!</li>
      <li>I love that they are eco friendly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still useful but not my favorite of this group.</li>
      <li>Good product, well made, soft bristles, would recommend.</li>
      <li>The EcoTools Mini Essentials set includes three brushes, one for full powder, an eye shading brush for eye shadow, and an angled liner brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The short handle makes it great to get really close and precise with gel liner, eyeshadow as liner, smudge pots type eyeshadow, etc.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue to buy more brushes in the future :)</li>
      <li>Soft and puts makeup on easily!  </li>
      <li>First time with this brand very soft love the edge eye shadow brush</li>
      <li>The eyebrow brush is a bit more &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; than other eyebrow brushes, so if you&#x27;re wanting more depth and precision this brush would not be for you.</li>
      <li>these brushes are very easy to pack and travel with, this is my second set</li>
      <li>Tinier than expected, but still works perfectly and has no problem fitting in my small carry case!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite to highlight the inner corners.</li>
      <li>Nice little set for your purse or travel.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something more wide and pronounced you might like this brush.</li>
      <li>Work very well.  </li>
      <li>The eyeliner brush was what really attracted me to the kit.</li>
      <li>But I feel like taking into account the price and how much I love that eyeliner brush, the fact that the powder brush isn&#x27;t so big is not enough to deduct a star from this.</li>
      <li>I mainly bought this set for the powder brush, which has yet to shed on me (which is why it gets five stars).</li>
      <li>I would ordered again but normal size</li>
      <li>I expected these to be bigger, so just be sure you know that are &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; mini....</li>
      <li>I love these little brushes!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
      <li>The mini eye brushes here are smaller than the normal eye set by EcoTools but not by much, maybe about an inch.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding.</li>
      <li>Because I wear glasses and I&#x27;m very nearsighted, I like using short brushes.</li>
      <li>Quality brushes...very soft</li>
      <li>The brushes are so soft, and made from bamboo and recycled materials.</li>
      <li>Items are very small as many reviewers stated.</li>
      <li>The small eye brush doesn&#x27;t really work for applying eye-shadow, but its okay to get small spots or nose on face</li>

    <li> I love Ecotools and this is a great mini set. The bristles are soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding. I&#x27;ll continue to buy more brushes in the future :)</li>
    <li> like the EcoTools Mini Essentials set. The brushes are so soft, and made from bamboo and recycled materials. The EcoTools Mini Essentials set includes three brushes, one for full powder, an eye shading brush for eye shadow, and an angled liner brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As indicated in it’s name, it’s just the essentials and perfect to keep in your purse when you just need a quick freshening up! It’s also the perfect size to fit inside a stocking, and sure to be a hit on Christmas morning! The EcoTools Mini Essentials set is great for all the women on your list this year!</li>
    <li> Tinier than expected, but still works perfectly and has no problem fitting in my small carry case! I mainly bought this set for the powder brush, which has yet to shed on me (which is why it gets five stars). The eyebrow brush is a bit more &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; than other eyebrow brushes, so if you&#x27;re wanting more depth and precision this brush would not be for you. The angled eyeliner brush is more &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;, but a bit thick for applying a thin line of eyeliner. If you&#x27;re looking for something more wide and pronounced you might like this brush. Would recommend these brushes if you need to conserve space in your case.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected but will get the job done. Items are very small as many reviewers stated. Items are still good quality though.</li>
    <li> Lovely brushes that are easy to hold and have a nice feel.  Work very well.  I recommend without reservation.</li>
    <li> Great size for purse!</li>
    <li> Quality brushes...very soft</li>
    <li> These brushes are compact in length, which is what I wanted, but the brush part themselves are too small/weak. Don&#x27;t work right, and I waited too long to return --- no longer eligible. :(</li>
    <li> The perfect size for keeping in your purse, and the only three brushes I need! I love that they are eco friendly.</li>
    <li> I like the size and variety. It is all I need.</li>
    <li> these brushes are very easy to pack and travel with, this is my second set and I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Soft and puts makeup on easily!  Great value and great brushes!</li>
    <li> Cute and great brushes, I got them on sale.  The small eye brush doesn&#x27;t really work for applying eye-shadow, but its okay to get small spots or nose on face</li>
    <li> I love these little brushes! The largest is a perfect blush brush, and the others work well at applying eyeshadow and liner.</li>
    <li> Those are smaller than I thod... But still ok, mini size but they work..  I would ordered again but normal size</li>
    <li> I got this set together with the eye set. Because I wear glasses and I&#x27;m very nearsighted, I like using short brushes. The mini eye brushes here are smaller than the normal eye set by EcoTools but not by much, maybe about an inch. I like to keep them together because that set comes with a case. The eyeshadow brush is much smaller than the highlighting brush from the EcoTools Eye set, but bigger and a little fluffier than the petite eye shading brush from that kit. It&#x27;s my favorite to highlight the inner corners. The eyeliner brush was what really attracted me to the kit. The short handle makes it great to get really close and precise with gel liner, eyeshadow as liner, smudge pots type eyeshadow, etc. Finally, the powder brush is in my opinion a little too small to powder my entire face. I&#x27;m used to the ELF slanted kabuki for powder and I can&#x27;t imagine myself changing to this one, even for travel. I like that it&#x27;s very soft. I find myself using it for powder highlighter. It can work for powder blush but I mostly use cream blush and the ELF stipple brush. It&#x27;s still useful but not my favorite of this group. But I feel like taking into account the price and how much I love that eyeliner brush, the fact that the powder brush isn&#x27;t so big is not enough to deduct a star from this. Anyone who&#x27;s ever hit the mirror with long-handled brushes from standing too close will appreciate this set as well as the eye set from this brand.</li>
    <li> Arrived late but I like the set......</li>
    <li> Good product, well made, soft bristles, would recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice little set for your purse or travel.  Makes a good stocking stuffer too.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand of brush.  I expected these to be bigger, so just be sure you know that are &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; mini....good for carrying in your purse.</li>
    <li> good value...cruelty free materials</li>
    <li> First time with this brand very soft love the edge eye shadow brush</li>
