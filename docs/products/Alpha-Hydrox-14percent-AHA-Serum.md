      <li>but so far I&#x27;m not that impressed.</li>

      <li>For my skin it&#x27;s OK to use twice a day.</li>
      <li>This one is more liquid based</li>
      <li>This product works just as well as the many OVERPRICED items with comparable ingredients.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t impressed by this at all, and I absolutely love the Alpha Hydroxy pads by the same company</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t credit all the positives to this serum alone because I also love the benefits of the vitamin c, but by golly, my regime is working</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more of a serum girl</li>
      <li>Love the silky feel.will buy again.</li>

      <li>I love these products.</li>
      <li>Love the feel of this serum.</li>
      <li>I usually love their products, but not this one.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Alpha Hydrox line for 20 years or more.  </li>
      <li>Love Alpha Hydrox.  </li>
      <li>Will know better once I am asked again for my ID.</li>
      <li>Effective on mild pimples too.</li>
      <li>I use it on my hands and neck/chest as well for great soft skin!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a higher percent glycolic acid so very glad to see this on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Well, after this much time, I can&#x27;t say it is doing any good</li>
      <li>Just remember to wash your hands after applying, its quite strong and cause flaking if used too often</li>
      <li>Upon contacting the company rep, I was told the rep checked the lots and that they are good for three years and that these lots of new product should not have expired.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I had no issue with the increased AHA and am enjoying how the serum soaks into my skin so quickly...</li>
      <li>My light colored freckles and fine lines have not disappeared.</li>
      <li>I recommend applying it lightly with a cotton ball vs fingers.</li>
      <li>but fortunately I don&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s silky smooth feel.</li>
      <li>Light, non-greasy and non-sticky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 months every night and my skin has never been so smooth and radiant.</li>
      <li>My skin looks smooth with a fresher look.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product and highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I&#x27;ve had good results so far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised that more people don&#x27;t know about it  because it is a highly successful exfoliant that is easy on even my sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product and reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Love this product a friend had told me about it and they were correct on how they said it made their skin feel.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This product has done nothing for me.  My light colored freckles and fine lines have not disappeared.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I have used this product for years....keeps my skin looking fresh and renewed</li>
    <li> I had been using the Alpha Hydrox soufflé for years and decided to try this one because it is stronger.  Although both products are awesome, I didn&#x27;t find that this worked &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; because it was stronger.  I just really like the soufflé better-- seems to leave my face softer for some reason.</li>
    <li> The product is fine enough, but the bottle leaks and made such a mess that I eventually threw it out.</li>
    <li> wish it had a pump but the product itself is very effective</li>
    <li> I have been using various serums for years so I know that I am tolerant to glycolic alpha hydroxy products.  This one is more liquid based so I tend to pour out too much and waste it.  I think I am better off with a gel based product, although it&#x27;s not as effective as this liquid. I will save the liquid for when I give myself a facial treatment and weekends when I&#x27;m not in a rush.</li>
    <li> Been using a few weeks but haven&#x27;t seen any results yet. Will try something else next time.</li>
    <li> stings for a long time  I use it only once a week</li>
    <li> Very nice!  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I was a bit shy of ordering this product after reading of some users&#x27; bad experiences with it. Luckily, I&#x27;ve had good results so far. The product arrived quickly, and it was well packaged; the inner safety seal wasn&#x27;t breached. I have used Alpha Hydrox for a long time, so I&#x27;m sure that I got the genuine article.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is liquid, like a toner. I recommend applying it lightly with a cotton ball vs fingers. At 14% it&#x27;s quite potent, so new users should do the recommended patch test. I apply it at night, before moisturizer. Never skip sunscreen in the AM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that the serum can be rinsed off if you have sensitive skin. Also, use care when applying other AHA or exfoliating products whilst using this serum - I made that mistake and my skin was very irritated for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m new to the 14% serum, so I may not see results for a while, but I will check back here &amp; report my results.</li>
    <li> It works. I have had deep wrinkles in my forehead from the sun. After several weeks of use, and mixing it with Vitamin C serum and Hyaluronic acid serum I can tell a big difference. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this product, made in the USA, is one of the best I have ever used. It is inexpensive and it actually works. My skin looks and feels great!  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This product works just as well as the many OVERPRICED items with comparable ingredients. I&#x27;m surprised that more people don&#x27;t know about it  because it is a highly successful exfoliant that is easy on even my sensitive skin. It leaves my skin clear and exfoliated. I like their other products as well, especially the moisturizers. I put this on at night and then follow up with one of their moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Too strong for my skin; go for their less strong cream in a tube.  Much better!</li>
    <li> This exfoliant is strong, but effective.  It will sting sensitive skin, but I quite like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is not cheap at $13 a pop. It&#x27;s meant to contain a 14 percent solution and quite obviously does not. It is, as others have noted, like water both in texture and in its feeling of simple non-efficacy. Ironically, the 10 percent lotion really makes a difference and you can feel the acid. The souffle is also meant to have a higher percentage of acid but merely feels waxy and inactive. Upon contacting the company rep, I was told the rep checked the lots and that they are good for three years and that these lots of new product should not have expired. Perhaps the fault is in the suspension, that the active ingredient simply does not remain so in either of these two products.  David Ogilvy once said that that great marketing can only make a bad product fail faster. This is one such product. And there was no offer of restitution or anything of the kind. Don&#x27;t fall for this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a few years now and previously had used their gel for many years and think this is the best non prescription product out there. I have been plagued with adult grade 4 cystic acne for over 15 years now and it has been very hard to deal with. I find that using this along with my topical prescription acne med has really helped my acne and my skin overall. I know many people will say, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t look my age&amp;#34; but seriously, I really don&#x27;t. When I first started working at the high school I work at I was constantly harassed by the security guards as they thought I was a teenager. I have zero wrinkles anywhere on my face and am 37 years old. I know a lot of it has to do with genes, never smoking, drinking, always wearing sunscreen (and as my derm says a vegan diet is a must for aging) but I think this has really helped my skin not only for the acne, but for aging as well. I have oily, sensitive skin and this stuff does not bother it at all (even when I used to use it two times a day). Overall, the best over the counter product (besides sunscreen) that I have ever used on my face.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for a week.  No problems with drying or flaking... hoping that I see more of that soon as that was the reason I purchased it was to remove some of the top layers of dead skin.</li>
    <li> This serum is a clear liquid and goes on easily.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and I have definitely noticed a reduction in fine lines, though at my age I can&#x27;t get rid of all of them.  LOL  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Thank you!! A+A+A+A+A+</li>
    <li> I like this very much!  I will continue to buy it.  It works very well!</li>
    <li> A great AHA exfoliator. I use this in the morning right after I get out of the shower before applying creams, lotions, etc. I also use it at night right after I wash my face. This product is more effective if used before applying any other products. I apply this and wait for it to dry (only takes a minute or 2) and then apply retinol, cream, serum, etc. Contains a very high % Glycolic acid so some people may have a problem with it irritating their skin if they use it to often.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I highly recommend it and plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s anti aging but works GREAT for acne too. It keeps my back and face very clear.</li>
    <li> Affordable. Effective liquid/gel not a cream or lotion.</li>
    <li> Works very subtly, does not irritate.  So far it&#x27;s worked out well for me. I use it 1x week so I don&#x27;t dry out. It has helped with poor reduction and overall skin appearance.</li>
    <li> Really nice, non irritating; improvements noted over night!</li>
    <li> I love these products. 14% AHA! Love the feel of this serum. It helps keep my aging skin brighter by sloughing off dead skin cells.  I also recently purchased a skin scraper which, when used with a light oil, also gets crud and dead skin off the surface of your skin...anywhere on your body.  I use a home made cream after the serum with a Shea butter base. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Serum naice. Me laik on skeen.</li>
    <li> Works very well! Best if used at night.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  I&#x27;ve been using the Alpha Hydrox line for 20 years or more.  The serum is really effective on slight resurfacing....during the winter, I use it often because it does do so well with the exfoliating.  Effective on mild pimples too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks and hallelujah, I think it&#x27;s the cure for my closed comedomes. I had an outbreak over 6 months ago and my tretinoin/retin-A helped eliminate most of it, but I had a few stubborn spots. This is the only thing out of many products I&#x27;ve tried that is making the comedomes budge. I used to use St. Ives Exfoliating pads, which (like Stridex) has some AHA but I bought this to try something stronger and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it at night, applying it with my fingers. I don&#x27;t like using a cotton ball because it soaks up too much product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I have super sensitive skin (red head and freckles and fair), but I use this every night without irritation. Can&#x27;t believe how great this stuff is and how affordable it is too.  Update: skin is looking amazing. No more facials for me this is my product. I use it on my hands and neck/chest as well for great soft skin!</li>
    <li> I use it every day. I believe it helps keep my skin younger looking.</li>
    <li> Ive used Alpha Hydrox products before but I think this bottle was  possibly not authentic.  When I used the product I did not have any tingling or stinging whatsoever. Nothing. To give it the benefit of the doubt, I have used most of the bottle, however, I have not noticed any improvement on my skin, and, as I said, NO stinging or tingling at all so I seriously doubt the authenticity of this product.</li>
    <li> This is not a lotion. It is clear. It goes on similarly to a lotion but is thinner. I use it under a Sunscreen.</li>
    <li> The product works well.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I am Irish with fair skin and freckles and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin that I stop using it before seeing results - which is like the next day!  I only use in the evening and love that it absorbs so quickly.</li>
    <li> Great. Notice results alost immediately.</li>
    <li> Based on what other people were saying, I thought this would really be a miracle product.  I use this product at night in conjunction with the AHA Enhanced Creme for the day.  I am only 36, but after five weeks, I can&#x27;t say I notice any major, or minor, differences.  The condition of my skin feels the same, maybe even more dry due to the drying effect.  I waited this long to post because many reviewers said it takes a little while.  Well, after this much time, I can&#x27;t say it is doing any good and I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent everything it says it does</li>
    <li> I love this product. It leaves my skin soft and smooth. It&#x27;s  a great for exfoliation. Keeps my dark spots at bay. For my skin it&#x27;s OK to use twice a day.This is one of the few products with this percentage. I have middle aged skin.</li>
    <li> this stuff is cool.  I only use 2 drops in my palm for my entire face, AM &amp; PM</li>
    <li> This line single handedly changed the texture of my skin for the awesomer! Helps with acne as well as scarring and smoothes overall texture and minimizes pores! Have re bought at least 3 times now. Also lasts forever. Just remember to wash your hands after applying, its quite strong and cause flaking if used too often</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now.  My skin is very smooth, glowing, and looks healthy.  Although it&#x27;s strong 14%, I have never found it abrasive or irritating.  I rub it in with my fingers after I wash my face before going to bed.  I thought I&#x27;d need a moisturizer after applying it, but I don&#x27;t!  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> sloughs off dry skin fast.  expect dry skin for a while, but as skin becomes accustomed to it, it will make your skin brighter and more translucent .</li>
    <li> All of the Alpha Hydrox products have been extremely good for me, and for the friends I have recommended to. They really work as advertised, and they sell them at &amp;#34;reasonable&amp;#34; prices.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t like any other Alpha Hydrox glycolic product - it has the color and consistency of water, so don&#x27;t expect this to be like the Souffle or any of the lotions. It&#x27;s also a stronger acid level and that 2% does make a difference at first, at least it did for me, and I was using the 12% Souffle twice per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, the serum made my face a little itchy and I had a slight burning sensation. I didn&#x27;t feel this at all with the 12% - the difference could also be because the souffle was a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, I&#x27;ve been using the Alpha Hydrox Souffle 12% Glycolic AHA twice per day (for about 5 months). I loved the results - my skin was much smoother, brighter and the freckling from sun exposure had decreased dramatically. I wanted to kick things up a notch, so I purchased this. What&#x27;s worked for me is to continue using the Souffle in the morning (no moisturizer) and at night I use the serum with my regular moisturizer (I use Aveeno).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week, my skin has brightened noticeably - enough that people have commented and asked if I&#x27;m using something new. It&#x27;s tempting to use these AHA products for a couple of weeks and not seeing a great result, give up. Stick with it!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the price exceptional! I have 63 year young skin but still oily in some spots. My skin looks smooth with a fresher look.  Easy to apply and no harsh reactions.  I&#x27;ve tried many serum in my days and this works as well or better than $50 plus serum! I always check Amazon 1st before I buy beauty products. Usually I find competitive prices plus Fast delivery along with superb customer service. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Light, non-greasy and non-sticky. It tingles a little especially if you use something like a facial scrub prior to use as the small beads or ground nuts that may be in the scrub causes superficial, small tears on the skin. It also may if you started off with a high concentration from the jump, instead of using a lower concentration then letting your skin adjust. I started off with a 10% for a few months from Alpha Hydrox, then switched up to this. Anyway, my skin felt smoother and softer first few days I started using it which is a miracle because I got acne scars really bad under my neck and on the side of my face, but now I can&#x27;t stop touching my skin and not recoiling in disgust. Additionally, I like that it has a top that can snap open and closed with a push of a finger on top. Since the ingredients can degrade when exposed to air, its quite convenient. Lastly for the women who say it doesn&#x27;t help, have you tried putting sunscreen on when using this product? AHA and BHA products cause sun sensitivity and may bring your hyperpigementation back if you don&#x27;t put on a decent SPF before going outside. Hope that helps.</li>
    <li> Not sure why, but this doesn&#x27;t work. I purchased this item based on the INCI list, with a high percentage of AHA on it, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. I have a lot of experience with products from several other brands whom carry AHA based products, and these did a lot of good to my skin, but this item? Mweh, nada, niente. A waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 62 age spots are a pain.&lt;br /&gt;This is working. It really is.&lt;br /&gt;Buy here....saves time gas money and it&#x27;s so much easier.</li>
    <li> This works. If you use it with Frownies for your forehead wrinkles, it will really work. This hydrox formula will also nip any whiteheads or pimples in the bud. Will make a pimple go away in less than half the time. Also, add Oregano oil to your diet and use on serious pimples... Very fast healing and smoothing your skin.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; good service</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using a 10% glycolic cream by a different brand for about a year. I like it but it don&#x27;t creams. I&#x27;m more of a serum girl and this is perfect. I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 months every night and my skin has never been so smooth and radiant. The acne scars on my forehead are disappearing. My pores noticeably smaller. Also I&#x27;m less oily. In the morning, I wash with African black soap and apply 10% benzoyl peroxide cream. It&#x27;s not overly creamy like lotion and it absorbs fast. At night I wash my face with the same soap and apply the AHA serum. It&#x27;s all I need. I use it on my chest and neck too. Once a week, I&#x27;ll use a PMD and I don&#x27;t use the serum afterwards because it&#x27;ll burn and I&#x27;ve done that before. Follow the directions. Especially if you&#x27;re sensitive. I only use 4 drops of the serum. Just 4 and that&#x27;s it. I put the drops in palm and use my fingertips to spread on my face. It&#x27;s a little watery but that&#x27;s fine. It dries quick. I will repurchase this again. Definitely recommend. No adverse effects. I&#x27;m interested in buying the other products as well.</li>
    <li> Alpha Hydrox products are the best on the market and they are reasonably priced as well.  I have used many skin products over the years and paid a great deal of money for them.  None have worked as well as the Alpha Hydrox.  I&#x27;m mainly interested in lightening the age spots (I&#x27;m 67) and this serum does a great job at that, as well as just improving the appearance of my skin.  I&#x27;m an avid gardener and I have found that wiping my stained nails with this serum bleaches them beautifully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Alpha Hydrox 12% and wanting to step up my anti-aging regimen, this product works. As soon as I stepped out of the shower and used just a little bit on my face (a little goes a long way, you guys!) the first time I tried, I could feel it tingling and working. I&#x27;ve been using it just under one month and my husband says that a hereditary dark spot that I have had trouble getting rid of is starting to lighten up. Needless to say, I&#x27;m happy. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product. To keep the ingredients &amp;#34;active&amp;#34;, I keep it in the refrigerator. Another plus: It&#x27;s a great face refresher when you apply a cold serum to your face.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty great. I use the Day by Day vitamin c serum in the morning and this at night. I&#x27;ve noticed a mild peeling, but I needed it. I had slight scarring from a bizarre rash, and this is helping it a lot. Can&#x27;t credit all the positives to this serum alone because I also love the benefits of the vitamin c, but by golly, my regime is working and I love it.</li>
    <li> Will have to repurchase. It&#x27;s really good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the consistancy of water. I usually love their products, but not this one.</li>
    <li> Love the silky feel.will buy again.I recommendd</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Alpha Hydrox products for years!  It works.  Keeps skin renewed and fresh..</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF WORKS AS LONG AS YOU CONTINUE TO USE IT FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> This has been the only product so far that has made progress in getting rid of my acne instead of just smoothing my face out or leaving acne growth at a stalemate.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed by this at all, and I absolutely love the Alpha Hydroxy pads by the same company</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a higher percent glycolic acid so very glad to see this on Amazon.  Have used this brand before and I think for the money it is very good.  My skin has uneven and red tones so using it daily to help correct the problem.  I think it is working and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This serum really works!! My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years!</li>
    <li> I use this for removing &amp;#34;tag&amp;#34; moles, etc. and with time, it works great. Beats spending money at the dermatologist getting them off!</li>
    <li> gave me a bad rash on my neck</li>
    <li> It really does improve the appearance of fine lines.</li>
    <li> Not sure how to feel about this product. I have used Alpha Hydrox lotion at 12% and it was great. This is like water and seems to be meant as a toner?? Sure as heck can&#x27;t dump it on your fingers and rub it in very well, you can only release it in drops because it&#x27;s so watery. Not what I expected for consistency but I can work around that if it works on my skin and shows results. My skin didn&#x27;t feel softer and I didn&#x27;t realize a more clear tone to my skin like I do with the Alpha lotions. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and give it some more time but so far I&#x27;m not that impressed.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use</li>
    <li> Amazing product and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> very strong, causes a breakouts</li>
    <li> As a 68 year-old female with oily facial skin, exfoliation is essential.  I&#x27;ve been using Alpha Hydrox Souffle (12% glycolic acid) at night for several years and was pleased with how it helped my skin stay clear and allow the pressed mineral powder foundation I use go on smoothly.  When I read about the 14% serum I wanted to give it a try.  It is now part of my nightly routine taking the place of the souffle.  I had no issue with the increased AHA and am enjoying how the serum soaks into my skin so quickly...the souffle takes a few minutes which slows down my nightly routine.  The price is certainly reasonable especially when compared to other brands offering the same glycolic acid % product.  If I could change anything about the AH Intensive Serum it would be the delivery method.  When only a few drops are needed and the serum is very thin, it&#x27;s easy to waste product using the press down top.</li>
    <li> More of a twice monthly treatment, at least for me. Great results. Don&#x27;t skimp on sunblock. This line yields MUCH BETTER results than several aha products that cost up to three times as much. For those of you whining about stinging or slight discomfort, quit being a namby pamby. Any aha or retinoid worth trying is going to do this.</li>
    <li> Was expecting the product to be more potent, bUT it did what it said it did, expholiate. I Would consider tea tree oil over this.</li>
    <li> Has made my skin very soft.  Must be used as the first product after washing and used daily to see results.</li>
    <li> Love Alpha Hydrox.  Have been using for 5 years!</li>
    <li> Just started using this.  Will know better once I am asked again for my ID. (I am 50)  It has been many years.  Can&#x27;t wait.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I use it primarily on my back to prevent breakouts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several alpha hydrox products, but I have to say this serum is not my favorite.  It&#x27;s so thin and watery it makes you wonder if it really does anything.  I guess it does because my face is dry after using it, but other than that I haven&#x27;t really noticed any benefits. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> it works very well.  i like it&#x27;s silky smooth feel.</li>
    <li> Package was crushed and open. Don&#x27;t think the liquid was even alpha Hydroxy</li>
    <li> I had gotten the 12% AHA product and it worked well. I decided to try the 14% and it did nothing. It was also very watery where the 12% was more gel-like and did tingle. I saw improvement. This was like putting water on my face. It did nothing for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used Alpha Hydrox products for years. I love the way they feel on my face, and they really work. This product is no exception. I did start to see results in just a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that it is a thin liquid. It says on the package to use a cotton ball, but I prefer to put it on my fingertips and gently rub it across my face. It&#x27;s also a good idea to put this on your face first, let it dry, and then use any other creams or lotions over it as it works well that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any stinging or anything like that. It felt great on my face. In fact, it felt so good I was wondering if it was working. Everyone is telling me now that I have a glow, and I really like the improvements it&#x27;s making to my face. It works on any skin, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had been using a makeup called &amp;#34;Sudden Change&amp;#34;. It is not being made anymore so I found this product and I do love it. It leaves my skin feelling soft and dewey. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after a visit to my dermatologist who recommended a prescription strength Retin-A.  I have the beginning stages of sun damage along my hair line.  I&#x27;m 42 years old with good overall skin but I do have red blotches starting and wanted to go a less evasive route than starting with Retin-A.  I&#x27;ve been using the serum every other evening with the Souffle during the day, everyday.  I have noticed a considerable change in my skins texture and definitely diminishing redness.  Also my neck area has completely changed back to the way it used to be when I was younger.  I am a skin care junkie.  I have a bathroom full of everything from the very expensive to drugstore brands.  With the exception of using my Clinique, All About Eyes and Neutrogena Rapid Repair, this is all I&#x27;ve been using and the results are amazing.  This is one of the few products that really lives up to the great reviews.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how much serum the bottle contains. Because you only need a few drops, it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
    <li> Its watery not like a lotion. I used Alpha lotion in the past, was good, and I decided to try this serum. Mistake!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Good value!</li>
    <li> If you have acne and wrinkles this product is perfect.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for something that would help lighten discoloration on my face. Only days after using Alpha Hydrox Intensive Serum dark spots on my face began to lighten. When my husband complimented me on how nice my complexion looked I knew I had found the product I had been looking for. Alpha Hydrox Intensive Serum does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> This product resulted in a noticeable difference in my skin. My skin felt smoother and softer immediately after using, and just a few weeks after using every 2 or 3 days (not even every day, as I have sensitive skin), friends were asking what I did differently. I also recommended this to my sister who sunbathes and sometimes has a rough/dry appearance, and the next time I saw her, it looked like she had had work done. It makes your skin look smoother and poreless. I would probably pay 3x this price for this product...but fortunately I don&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as part of a nightly routine with the Alpha Hydrox face wash (also highly recommended), Paula&#x27;s Choice toner and retinol serum, and Cerave moisturizer or pure virgin coconut oil. And of course, sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Appears to work well.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well to keep skin soft and wrinkles away.</li>
    <li> really like this product,  i use it every other nite.  aha one nite then bha the other. i have seen improvement of my combination skin.</li>
</ol>
