<ol>
      <li>these are the best.</li>
      <li>Best trimmer that I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
      <li>Great clippers!</li>
      <li>This blade is not the best for  armpits because it can pinch.</li>
      <li>Did a great job and holds a charge for 4 week trips across the pond!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy adding this clipper to my tools that I ordered a spare.</li>
      <li>But it did a great job - 3-4 good years!</li>
      <li>, I am really happy that I bought this one</li>
      <li>I think its a great buy.</li>
      <li>Detail trimming is great with this.</li>
      <li>Works great on pads and finishing touch ups.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>Great trimmer for my mustache and around my ears.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a hair stylist and needed a good clipper</li>
      <li>Should have stuck with the ruby by andis, was hoping this would be as good... but its just not.  </li>
      <li>This newer trimmer is a a great upgrade over the original model (which still works great after about five or six years).</li>
      <li>and I was getting top notch Trimmers NOT !</li>
      <li>/&gt;T-Blade is nice for edging around ears.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased this trimmer with intentions of having a handy trimmer while traveling.</li>
      <li>I liked it</li>
      <li>They stayed charged for quite awhile which was nice but</li>
      <li>This trimmer has the perfect attachments for a close beard trim and is of professional quality as I would use this as a hair stylist .</li>
      <li>The protruding edge of the \\&quot;T\\&quot; blade allows you to trim the hair in your ears better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
      <li>life  is  better</li>
      <li>The more they cover, the shorter the blade will trim.</li>
      <li>Love andis clippers but will never purchase their trimmers again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with this item.</li>
      <li>One clipper does not do it all for best results you need several.</li>
      <li>so it cost me $20 bucks to deal with the company that was selling 100 items a month I would have done better</li>
      <li>It is a reliable, easy to use trimmer with some built in obsolescence.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge Andis fan.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quiet and works great.  </li>
      <li>not as good as my old Andis .  </li>
      <li>It does make this user look much better than he has a right to look.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t give you the clean line.</li>
      <li>Andis really needs to design this electric trimmer to be able to use rechargeable batteries.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once adjusted they are just as good as Andis clippers always are (my last pair has lasted me almost a decade.</li>
      <li>The blades are super sharp which means I can fly through my beard and not worry about pulling hairs out.</li>
      <li>I purchased a pair of these trimmers years ago, and they worked fine for a while, but as I am about to trash these, I first decided to remove the three screws on it to see if there was a rechargeable battery that could be replaced.</li>
      <li>Over all, this trimmer is certainly worthy of the Andis name.</li>
      <li>the t-shaped head makes them so much easier to cut around ears and they are like 4 times faster moving than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
      <li>Not as strong as the one I bought 6 years ago but its definitely one of the most powerful cordless trimmers</li>
      <li>The guides provided work great and are not cheap or flimsy.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s it, screw everything back, and enjoy the trimmer :)</li>
      <li>not as  powerful and not the quality I like .</li>
      <li>Well, they&#x27;re right, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other trimmers, both cheap and expensive, and this is the best trimmer I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>When I went to first use it the battery lasted under 5 min.</li>
      <li>for the most part cuts fine after passing it a few times.</li>
      <li>I like my hair cut short -- about 1/8 inch long -- and this trimmer will give me a good haircut just by snapping on one of the included attachments, which is designed for that length.  </li>
      <li>Well it got here in perfect condition, sharp as can be and really performs well and cuts close, the wide T head makes back cleanup fast and easy and outlining private areas is great, just be careful not to catch loose skin in the blade</li>
      <li>It does not cut very close to the skin</li>
      <li>, I thought that this one had carbon steel blades, but it has stainless steel, I don&#x27;t know the difference</li>
      <li>It cuts as fast as I can move it.    </li>
      <li>Fast shipment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve switched back to a corded trimmer because it is more powerful, quiet and cuts close.&lt;br</li>
      <li>While the clipper is convenient with the shape and cordless feature, the rechargeable battery gave out after a bit over a year of very lite use.</li>
      <li>but I expected better</li>
      <li>Andis clippers came highly recommended but they are not all that!</li>
      <li>that have even finer teeth on the blades, and therefore they will cut even shorter, which is nice for trimming your neck or edging your beard, where you want the hair cut as short as possible.  </li>
      <li>after a week of them not giving that clean cut line I ended up buying new trimmers different brand.</li>
      <li>You see, after two years of use, this particular model no longer will hold a charge.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it</li>
      <li>Have used a few Andis products over the years and thought this would be a safe bet.</li>
      <li>I had a tough time getting a trimmer that would work right,  My olere Whal trimmer was wearing out after 8 years, it was a battery powered one that worked pretty good and shaved pretty close although it had a narrow head</li>
      <li>Make sure that the green light displays when in the holster, indicating that the unit is properly seated and actually charging.</li>
      <li>I wanted a new one and was after one that would trim to 1/150th of an inch, I bid and won a \\&quot;new\\&quot; andis rechargable trimmer</li>
      <li>really well always give me a clean clothes shave and doesn&#x27;t leave any little hairs on the neck.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After looking at Andis Electric Pet Trimmer, I noticed that these look almost exactly the same as the 32375 model.</li>
      <li>Because the cost of the unit is comparatively modest, I chose to replace it with a new one.</li>
      <li>The battery wasn&#x27;t fully charged initially from open package which now won&#x27;t hold full charge.</li>
      <li>Adis enjoys an well deserved reputation for professional grooming equipment.</li>
      <li>No sharp lines for my side burn or soul patch.</li>
      <li>but I ran out of time on the item and couldn&#x27;t open a dispute and ended up only being able to give a negative feedback, dosen&#x27;t</li>
      <li>It works well and is good trimmer for hair cutting.</li>
      <li>I bought these a few months ago, and at first the blades were off from shipping (i hope) and i cut my friend on his \\&quot;neck beard\\&quot; area.</li>
      <li>and when i was ready to use it .. the trimmer died in less than five minutes ...</li>
      <li>it was old and worn out with a loose blade, I eventually got all my money back.  </li>

    <li> Edge is too sharp -- nicks the skin.</li>
    <li> Have used a few Andis products over the years and thought this would be a safe bet. While the clipper is convenient with the shape and cordless feature, the rechargeable battery gave out after a bit over a year of very lite use. I attempted to order a replacement battery only to find it is \\&quot;backordered\\&quot;. Well, if it does come in anytime soon, I wont know how to replace it as the rechargeable battery is soldered in. I think I&#x27;ll stick with the plug-in trimmers for now.</li>
    <li> This product is trash I thought price would differentiate and I was getting top notch Trimmers NOT ! What a waste of time! Purchased a Whal model. Also beware Unbeatable Sale does not issue RA # but in this case they did ! Second order from them that was not right! Andis clippers came highly recommended but they are not all that!</li>
    <li> I had a tough time getting a trimmer that would work right,  My olere Whal trimmer was wearing out after 8 years, it was a battery powered one that worked pretty good and shaved pretty close although it had a narrow head, now the on/off button doesn&#x27; stay put and I need to tape it to use it.  I wanted a new one and was after one that would trim to 1/150th of an inch, I bid and won a \\&quot;new\\&quot; andis rechargable trimmer, it was a fraud it was old and worn out with a loose blade, I eventually got all my money back.  then I on ebay ordered a corded styliner II I liked it but it had been badly packed(Christmas time and they left out one part of the packing) and was damaged in transit and the blade was a bit off.  I only got back the amount minus shipping so it cost me $20 bucks to deal with the company that was selling 100 items a month I would have done better but I ran out of time on the item and couldn&#x27;t open a dispute and ended up only being able to give a negative feedback, dosen&#x27;t mean much if your are a big seller. I researched the hellout fo all of these clippers and chose this one, there is one close in looks and a little bit less but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a commercial one, I thought that this one had carbon steel blades, but it has stainless steel, I don&#x27;t know the difference but I though that one is easier to sharpen than the other and cut closer, guess that it doesn&#x27;t matter, it will last for years, the old one did it&#x27;s still sharp.  Finally I ordered this one cancelling one that looked the same on the Andis web site, guess that this one is heavier duty.  Well it got here in perfect condition, sharp as can be and really performs well and cuts close, the wide T head makes back cleanup fast and easy and outlining private areas is great, just be careful not to catch loose skin in the blade, I am really happy that I bought this one and I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Item just as described!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It does the job. I recommend looking at YouTube to learn how to use it properly and practice, practice, practice!</li>
    <li> Finally, a trimmer that works well and doesn&#x27;t tear out my hair. I have tried many other trimmers, both cheap and expensive, and this is the best trimmer I have ever had. The blades are super sharp which means I can fly through my beard and not worry about pulling hairs out. It cuts as fast as I can move it.    Detail trimming is great with this. I can carve out whatever lines I wish. The battery lasts a very long time between charges. The guides provided work great and are not cheap or flimsy. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Just bought this trimmer [[ASIN:B000SDS3E4 Andis 32375 Power Trim Cordless Trimmer, Silver]] (from eBay, not Amazon), and for its price I think its a great buy. I use it every 2-3 days for keeping my hair as short as possible. I see people complaining about the trimming length to be too long because the blade doesn&#x27;t cut close enough to the skin. Well, they&#x27;re right, it doesn&#x27;t. BUT! the blade can be adjusted to cut so close as if it was a shaving machine. All you have to do, is to unscrew the two screws that holds the T-Blade to the trimmer. Then, unscrew the two small vertical screws that holds the upper part of the T-Blade (just release it a bit), and push this whole part up till the upper teeth&#x27;s edges will almost cover all the lower teeth. The more they cover, the shorter the blade will trim. just be careful not to let the upper part teeth go over the lower part teeth, because it can cut you when you&#x27;ll try trimming with this setup, since the upper part is the moving part. I&#x27;ve managed to adjust it to cut almost at length 0 (zero) millimeter from the skin, and it can be adjusted to cut even shorter. That&#x27;s it, screw everything back, and enjoy the trimmer :)</li>
    <li> not as good as my old Andis .  cheaper made . not as  powerful and not the quality I like .</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer with intentions of having a handy trimmer while traveling. However, my product failed to charge and only lasted about 10 mins from the previous charge at the manufacturer! I was very disappointed as Andis usually have high quality products.</li>
    <li> Dissapointed.  No sharp lines for my side burn or soul patch. Back to my $20 cheapie</li>
    <li> I have gone through about 4 trimmers trying to find one that worked as well as a previous one that I&#x27;d had. This one I just received WILL NOT hold a charge. Even when the power cord is connected the blade slows to the point of shutting off. I have always been a fan of andis, this trimmer especially. I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your time</li>
    <li> This newer trimmer is a a great upgrade over the original model (which still works great after about five or six years).</li>
    <li> some what weak compared to the corded. for the most part cuts fine after passing it a few times. Sometimes pulls hairs.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, it doesnt have the power to shave like a wire one does.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as the one I bought 6 years ago but its definitely one of the most powerful cordless trimmers</li>
    <li> I bought these a few months ago, and at first the blades were off from shipping (i hope) and i cut my friend on his \\&quot;neck beard\\&quot; area. Once adjusted they are just as good as Andis clippers always are (my last pair has lasted me almost a decade. Take it from a pro...these are the best. the t-shaped head makes them so much easier to cut around ears and they are like 4 times faster moving than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
    <li> It lasted a long time. Did a great job and holds a charge for 4 week trips across the pond! The blades wore out and I did not want to deal with trying to find the replacements...But it did a great job - 3-4 good years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for over three years.  I like my hair cut short -- about 1/8 inch long -- and this trimmer will give me a good haircut just by snapping on one of the included attachments, which is designed for that length.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this trimmer is the location of the on-off switch.  It was obviously designed to have a flashy appearance -- and it does have a flashy appearance.  But unfortunately, the location of this switch causes me to occasionally put sufficient pressure on it that it either reduces the power or turns the trimmer off entirely.  The switch is located right where you want to put your thumb or finger when you&#x27;re cutting your hair.  Dumb mistake!  Even so, I will probably replace this trimmer with another one like it when the rechargeable battery finally dies.  Andis makes other trimmers [not rechargeable though :( ] that have even finer teeth on the blades, and therefore they will cut even shorter, which is nice for trimming your neck or edging your beard, where you want the hair cut as short as possible.  But, like I said, I&#x27;ll probably buy another one of these someday. The protruding edge of the \\&quot;T\\&quot; blade allows you to trim the hair in your ears better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> My barber use these and they cut alright.. I purchased this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to make trips to the barber for touch up between cuts. I does what it suppose to do but I expected better</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. This clipper works really well always give me a clean clothes shave and doesn&#x27;t leave any little hairs on the neck.</li>
    <li> I charged it for like two hours and when i was ready to use it .. the trimmer died in less than five minutes ... don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I purchased a pair of these trimmers years ago, and they worked fine for a while, but as I am about to trash these, I first decided to remove the three screws on it to see if there was a rechargeable battery that could be replaced. You see, after two years of use, this particular model no longer will hold a charge. Upon inspection, there is no removable battery, just a made in mexico hard-wired type of battery that cannot be removed. It could be removed and somehow a consumer could do some modification probably and figure a way to make it hold 2 AAA batteries, but that isn&#x27;t our job. Andis really needs to design this electric trimmer to be able to use rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at Andis Electric Pet Trimmer, I noticed that these look almost exactly the same as the 32375 model. That is quite funny, yet they are less expensive than the model for humans.</li>
    <li> I like to use of cordless trimmer but recharge battery dead after 5 or 6 miniute, So I have to recharge to use.</li>
    <li> Great clippers! They hold a charge for a long time and cut close. I&#x27;ll recommend they to anyone. I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with this item.</li>
    <li> Poor design, it&#x27;s just OK. I&#x27;ve owned two sets of these. Both stopped holding a charge long before the clipper or blades had seen the end of their life and you cannot replace the battery. I&#x27;ve switched back to a corded trimmer because it is more powerful, quiet and cuts close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable: They don&#x27;t nick or scrape.&lt;br /&gt;T-Blade is nice for edging around ears.&lt;br /&gt;Cordless&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cannot replace the battery which doesn&#x27;t last. Two trimmers both had this issue.&lt;br /&gt;Underpowered/slower than other trimmers&lt;br /&gt;Loud&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as other trimmers.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for my mustache and around my ears. Holds its charge for a long time. Best trimmer that I&#x27;ve ever bought. Recommended by my barber (he has one).</li>
    <li> One clipper does not do it all for best results you need several. I loves this clipper it&#x27;s quiet and works great.  This blade is not the best for  armpits because it can pinch. Works great on pads and finishing touch ups. I&#x27;m very happy adding this clipper to my tools that I ordered a spare. Having several different style clippers makes any job faster.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has the perfect attachments for a close beard trim and is of professional quality as I would use this as a hair stylist .</li>
    <li> I bought the item as a gift for my son-in-law and he is tickled pink with the gift and how well it works!!  I will reccommend this Andis trimmer to anyone that I know!</li>
    <li> I charged the clipper over 24hrs before initial use like instructed too. When I went to first use it the battery lasted under 5 min. The clipper was also very weak when using it. I would not purchase this clipper if you plan on using it to clip entire body.</li>
    <li> Battery  life  is  better</li>
    <li> Adis enjoys an well deserved reputation for professional grooming equipment. Over all, this trimmer is certainly worthy of the Andis name. I use the trimmer approximately once every three days to trim my beard. In that process, I use three different sized attachments- one for the sides, one for the chin, and one for the moustache.  All &#x27;combs&#x27; are provided by the manufacturer. If you oil the unit per their instructions, it works well for about a year under these conditions. My trimmer is &#x27;holstered&#x27; in the charger between shaves. Make sure that the green light displays when in the holster, indicating that the unit is properly seated and actually charging. The one problem I have encountered is that, after about a year, the motor slows down even when fully charged, and if I take the fully charged unit on a short trip out of town, without the charger-to save the weight in my suitcase, it loses battery power in a few days even without using it.&lt;br /&gt;  Because the cost of the unit is comparatively modest, I chose to replace it with a new one. Moreover, as my son just became a big shot in a NY start-up, and needs to look properly coiffed, I  bought him one as well. It is a reliable, easy to use trimmer with some built in obsolescence. It does make this user look much better than he has a right to look. I am giving this four stars- shaving off one star for the stated concerns. David</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and needed a good clipper and this one did the trick. I&#x27;m a huge Andis fan.</li>
    <li> Works well and lasts a long time onn a single charge.  It does not cut very close to the skin so a razor blade is necessary afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is a so-so trimmer.  Should have stuck with the ruby by andis, was hoping this would be as good... but its just not.  Its decent, not great.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work as well on dog as it specifies, but my boyfriend seems to like it, so I will keep it.</li>
    <li> It only works for like 10 minutes than you have to charge it back was not what I especting</li>
    <li> Worse trimmers I have ever bought! They don&#x27;t give you the clean line. They stayed charged for quite awhile which was nice but after a week of them not giving that clean cut line I ended up buying new trimmers different brand. Love andis clippers but will never purchase their trimmers again.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer 3 weeks ago, and I didn&#x27;t have any problem with it. It works well and is good trimmer for hair cutting.</li>
    <li> Not happy with product. The battery wasn&#x27;t fully charged initially from open package which now won&#x27;t hold full charge.</li>
