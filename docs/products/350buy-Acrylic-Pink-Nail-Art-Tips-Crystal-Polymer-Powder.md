      <li>Thank you for such good products.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this, but this polymer is well...</li>
      <li>i am sure there was a main delay</li>
      <li>But the color is beautiful its a little runny but use able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and worth the price you pay to learn.</li>
      <li>This pint power makes your nail tips look more natural.</li>
      <li>it peels right off</li>
      <li>much sooner then expected which was nice!</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t get very much powder</li>
      <li>it really wasn&#x27;t worth it..</li>
      <li>Is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I order this for my daughter who is now interested in applying acrylic nails for a hobby.</li>
      <li>All in all, you&#x27;d be better off purchasing powder from you local beauty supply.</li>
      <li>a few dollars and buy a good, quality powder (like one from CND), not this.</li>
      <li>Expected more because the picture actually looks like more.</li>
      <li>and if it works I will buy more as long</li>
      <li>Plus the top was loose</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Also dries too fast.</li>
      <li>They shipped it to me fast.</li>
      <li>smh.it took a whole month to come which is today</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>had I realized I wasn&#x27;t getting much.</li>
      <li>The picture is really deceiving .</li>
      <li>So you don&#x27;t get as much as the advertisement allows you to believe.</li>
      <li>i love the pink acrylic powder and i would order it again.</li>
      <li>I have had the product for a while but havent used it because I was instantly turned off by the size and the cheap label on it.  </li>
      <li>Only 1/2 of my jar was filled.</li>
      <li>The bottom is lifted on the inside so you don&#x27;t get as much a</li>
      <li>is ok is not much of it but is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
      <li>Very little containers but overall the powder works great</li>
      <li>then it would dry quickly!</li>
      <li>the jar however is a decent size.</li>
      <li>and I did buy in bulk of different acrylic powders, but outside of all that this product does exactly what it says its going to do and what I expect it to do, so lighten up just a litl and enjoy the product.</li>
      <li>Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product other than half of it spilling out during shipping.</li>
      <li>The jar is tiny, very tiny even though it was cheap.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t like this the jar is tiny, very tiny even though it was cheap.</li>
      <li>it was only half way filled!</li>
      <li>Clear not opaque.</li>
      <li>Not helpful if you are a professional and need quantity.</li>
      <li>From looking at the picture you would expect the container to be fairly large, well, it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s very small and you would also expect the entire jar to be filled with the powder</li>
      <li>it dosent dry up to fast so 5 star for on time delivery</li>
      <li>It was so tiny and half full.</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s barely anything in there.</li>
      <li>it lifts like crazy and your better off going to a beauty supply store and buying a true pink polymer.</li>
      <li>This product leaves pink streaks through the nail.. and just wants to peal back off..</li>
      <li>There is only a small amount of powder in the jar, it is full only to about where the lid area reaches.</li>
      <li>the pink acrylic is high quality however i was expecting a bit of a larger container.</li>
      <li>disappointed because it produces a very nice, natural looking pink color, but the consistency makes the powder unusable.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
      <li>disappointed because it produces a very nice, natural looking pink color, but the consistency makes the powder unusable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sucked. Nail powder does not stay on that well</li>
    <li> great! the only thing i dont like is it takes a long time for it to harden and acually make the acrlyic.</li>
    <li> The amount of powder was smaller than I realized. Held together fine.wouldn&#x27;t jave bought had I realized I wasn&#x27;t getting much.</li>
    <li> I ordered this again. Good quality</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this a negative 5. I was so angry when I got this in the mail because it wasn&#x27;t even powder!!! It was a pink buffering cream to put on your nail and cuticle!!!</li>
    <li> Not enough powder... you can basically do a manicure one time and that&#x27;s it. A little disappointing.</li>
    <li> will never purchase it again it was only half way filled!</li>
    <li> very nice after long time having this product i use it many times worrks perfect</li>
    <li> Very little containers but overall the powder works great</li>
    <li> This pint power makes your nail tips look more natural. I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I got it today so tiny and there&#x27;s barely anything in there. It was shipped neatly,no spills, but there&#x27;s not even enough for two applications 😕😕😡 would never buy again</li>
    <li> What a huge ripoff!!! The photo is very deceiving, the jar is NOT full!! There is only a small amount of powder in the jar, it is full only to about where the lid area reaches. Beyond the &amp;#34;threaded&amp;#34; area where the lid screws on, the jar is sectioned off and completely empty!!! I was barely able to stretch it to two applications. ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY!!! Huge scam!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product! The acrylic bubbles and is foggy. The jar is miss leading too. The bottom is not really the bottom of the jar. The bottom is lifted on the inside so you don&#x27;t get as much a you think you are.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this the jar is tiny, very tiny even though it was cheap. The powder is very runny and hard to work with.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed because it produces a very nice, natural looking pink color, but the consistency makes the powder unusable.</li>
    <li> Not enough powder in the jar very small impression that you Candices that is a big jar and it&#x27;s not going to take a picture of it didn&#x27;t show you the ounces so you get very disappointed when you see this this little tiny jar of powder</li>
    <li> I like the color. The polymer took a long time to dry on my nails. The container was small.</li>
    <li> The jar is itty bitty.  There is enough acrylic to do maybe 3 to 4 fillings.  I have had the product for a while but havent used it because I was instantly turned off by the size and the cheap label on it.  It made me wonder if it was a relable product.  Plus the top was loose so I lost some of the 3 ounces of powder I had.  Dont be like me...Just pay the extra money and get something reliable.</li>
    <li> well i bought two of these andi only recieved one in the mail.im still waiting for the other one to get here...the due date is way past due..</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing in this do not get it there was nothing in the container I did two set of nails with it it&#x27;s a rip off smh the worst</li>
    <li> From looking at the picture you would expect the container to be fairly large, well, it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s very small and you would also expect the entire jar to be filled with the powder and it&#x27;s not, there&#x27;s probably only 1/3 of the space inside the container so you don&#x27;t get very much powder, I hope I have enough of this to at least do my nails a few times.</li>
    <li> Ridiculously small amount of powder in this jar, couldn&#x27;t even finish all ten of my fingers. Completely absurd, and I would recommend not buying this product.</li>
    <li> is ok is not much of it but is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
    <li> Received today 12/05/2014.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my nails. Is exactly as described. Arrived before the scheduled time and was in pretty good packaging. I just wish I had ordered more.</li>
    <li> It is a bit sticky and takes too long to harden up. Delivery rate was average.</li>
    <li> I love using this product. It works very well. I have ordered this before and I love it. They shipped it to me fast. i will order it again. I will be referring this company to all my costumers to order this. I am very glad my order came early and they are easy to work with if any thing happens. Thank you for such good products.</li>
    <li> well gonna try it soon and if it works I will buy more as long it dosent dry up to fast so 5 star for on time delivery</li>
    <li> I order this for my daughter who is now interested in applying acrylic nails for a hobby. I have ordered her all of the material that is needed and she is excited to have all of the things to work with. I received this earlier than expected and there was no damage. Thanks.</li>
    <li> i am sure there was a main delay and that is fine. i love the pink acrylic powder and i would order it again. thank you.</li>
    <li> Great quality and smooth application. Long lasting and not at all gritty. It is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Cheaper then the store or salon and it works good been trying to save money by doing my own nails</li>
    <li> this product is good, I am learning and don&#x27;t know how to do nails, but this works for me. It&#x27;s inexpensive and worth the price you pay to learn.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product other than half of it spilling out during shipping.</li>
    <li> Really, really small.  Not helpful if you are a professional and need quantity.</li>
    <li> Well this got here much sooner then expected which was nice! The only thing that bothered was that it was sooo small for $7 dollars. But the color is beautiful its a little runny but use able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody who does acrylic could use this to play around with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t use it just pointing out my opinion on it(:</li>
    <li> This is not a good acrylic to do nails with, it is very sticky nd take over three minutes to dry I would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.</li>
    <li> the pink acrylic is high quality however i was expecting a bit of a larger container. If you need a lot of acrylic i suggest buying in bulk :)</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected I dislike product because as it stated on Site clear,white,and pink when I received it was only one and really small. I will never again order this.</li>
    <li> This product leaves pink streaks through the nail.. and just wants to peal back off.. i guess u get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> The jar is tiny, very tiny even though it was cheap. Only 1/2 of my jar was filled. The powder is very runny and hard to work with.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed because it produces a very nice, natural looking pink color, but the consistency makes the powder unusable.&lt;br /&gt;Save a few dollars and buy a good, quality powder (like one from CND), not this.</li>
    <li> I just received this product today and none spilled, very nice size for the pricing,. I do nails my self and I totally recommend. But I havent used it yet im waiting on my acrylic brushes to come so, I absolutely love this. Its filled all the easy up to the top. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the color and ease of using this powder.  Doesn&#x27;t clump or get air bubbles in it. Goes on smooth and looks great. The color is fantastic.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this, but this polymer is well... poor. Its not a true pink polymer. the powder is pink but applies clear. it lifts like crazy and your better off going to a beauty supply store and buying a true pink polymer. the jar however is a decent size. Dont use this on clients if you purchase this. Just use it for yourself. Not professional quality.</li>
    <li> these people can fool you by the pictures to make you spend your money on something thats not even big or what the picture looks like omg smh.it took a whole month to come which is today i receive it.this is so small that u wish u just went to sally beauty supply store to buy it. shame on you people...</li>
    <li> This powder is very different from the stuff I usually use. Clear not opaque. Also dries too fast. Different texture than in used to.</li>
    <li> Way small only 25 gm no not auto type its really gm nit worth the man eye expected much more very disappointed. 👎👎</li>
    <li> package came in original condition</li>
    <li> The container is hollow with a small recess for the powder. So you don&#x27;t get as much as the advertisement allows you to believe.It&#x27;s approximately .25 to .75 ounces.  But it&#x27;s not a total lost, I only paid 2.10 for it. All in all, you&#x27;d be better off purchasing powder from you local beauty supply.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected . The picture is really deceiving . Expected more because the picture actually looks like more. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I need to wait almost two months to receive it, and when it finally comes, it only has half an ounce of product, only for two fills.</li>
    <li> I always order this acrylic because it is cheap and good quality! the only down fall is how small the containers are but its reasonable for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small, would have used a larger bottle. But it is was was stated in selling list.  it is okay.</li>
    <li> i wouldn&#x27;t work with it ! if you made the ball to big then it would dry quickly! also it gets hard but you cant even work with it because it is so freaking sticky ! it peels right off</li>
    <li> The product is great and works amazing no complaints!! 👍</li>
    <li> It was so tiny and half full. Will not buy again.. it really wasn&#x27;t worth it.. Disappointed it arrived earlier than expected that is why I gave it 2 stars</li>
    <li> This took way to long to dry , very small jar and half full i was almost out during the set , it also broke one drying not a great product whatsoever 😫</li>
    <li> It works okay, when I got it it was spilled everywhere and you only get half the size of the little tube, there is an inside layer that is only half the size of the jar itself and it only gets you a couple uses</li>
    <li> shipment came on time I bought this product also because I want to learn how to do nail. I would consider anyone to buy products from this company.</li>
    <li> everyone is complaining that the jar I smaller, but being that when u have been doing nails for a while u already know this. I pay for quality not quantity. this Is a great product and I did buy in bulk of different acrylic powders, but outside of all that this product does exactly what it says its going to do and what I expect it to do, so lighten up just a litl and enjoy the product.</li>
    <li> The powder doesnt stay pink after a couple months it had lost all of its pigmentation :(</li>
