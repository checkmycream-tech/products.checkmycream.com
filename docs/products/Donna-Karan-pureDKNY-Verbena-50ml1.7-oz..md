      <li>I don&#x27;t know how they did it, but it takes me to another time and place that was free from stress and worry.</li>
      <li>Very fresh.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend to all that enjoy a light clean fragrance.</li>
      <li>Very fresh and clean smelling.</li>
      <li>Ordered 1.7oz perfume and received that plus lotion and gift box, very surprised and pleased!</li>
      <li>I originally smelled this on a magazine insert.  </li>
      <li>Original price was nothing compared to WalMart.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a new fragrance to call my own.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance is light and crisp with a clean easy feeling.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get much Verbena, but I do love this scent.  </li>
      <li>It makes me want to find a soft breeze, grab a good book, and inhale the essence of Pure Verbena.</li>
      <li>I would reccomend this to any guy wanting to give a great perfume to their significate other</li>
      <li>Shame because this was the first perfume I decided to try because I&#x27;m new to perfume and was told this is a good first perfume</li>
      <li>The fragrance is so clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>It was a decent price from Amazon but better with my coupon.</li>
      <li>Was for My Daughter for her Birthday and it was at a very reasonable price plus free shipping</li>
      <li>But I avoid people for that first 10 minutes!</li>
      <li>Freedom, the smell of fresh air and sunshine, the sounds of nature, running water, the smell of the water.</li>
      <li>Still its very flowery and fresh and light.</li>
      <li>Smell fresh.</li>
      <li>Much lower than the stores or even Amazon originally priced it.</li>
      <li>The lotion smells really nice same exactly like the perfume.</li>
      <li>I was also surprised that they included a free lotion.</li>
      <li>I have to use a bit more than I&#x27;d like to get the effect I want 10 minutes later.  </li>
      <li>Verbena is a lovely, personal, floral scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great scent for everyday - especially for work since it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
      <li>; yet, I ended up not getting a real one.</li>
      <li>It is light and clean smelling, not too heavy or flowery.</li>
      <li>I usually prefer florals, but I got a sample of this and liked it so much I ordered it.  </li>
      <li>It is a clean, \\&quot;just showered\\&quot; scent, Irish Springy type scent.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I will order this particular item again.</li>
      <li>It is different from any other fragrance I own.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen the real thing and the liquid inside is clear like water.</li>
      <li>I layer this with the lotion because it is light enough and makes it last longer.</li>
      <li>I used to had the same exact perfume but the liquid inside is clear like water.</li>
      <li>My only complaint, if it is one, is that it goes on strong and fades relatively quickly.  </li>
      <li>Complete strangers compliment me.</li>
      <li>I was completely surprised when it came with a body lotion included.</li>
      <li>My 15 year old wanted this perfume.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I got a fake.</li>
      <li>it was a different dkny that I had in the past, but as soon as I smelled it, I was so glad I made the mistake.</li>
      <li>I spritz it on my wrists in the morning and it dries down to a very subtle floral that keeps me happy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find, but worth the search!</li>
      <li>The scent is not too weak and not too strong.</li>
      <li>There is a bad thing and a good one.</li>

<li> and it is not overwhelming or heavy at all.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if the scent wears off or I just get used to it, so I will take the lotion with me for touch up.</li>
<li> I have a hard time finding fragrances.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would have liked the scent to have more citrus in it ,like real verbena. THE  price was fair,service was good.I don&#x27;t think I will order this particular item again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this scent. I accidentally bought this thinking it was a different dkny that I had in the past, but as soon as I smelled it, I was so glad I made the mistake. It came with the lotion, and it was in a box just like you&#x27;d purchase in a store. I am very happy with this purchase. So affordable.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression I was ordering just the 1.7 oz fragrance, but it arrived as a gift set with a lotion! I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger as long as I&#x27;d like, but spraying not only on your skin, but clothes as well, helps that! The fragrance is so clean and fresh. I just love it!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase.  I was expecting only the bottle of fragrance and got a body butter as well!</li>
    <li> FIVE stars for fragrance; FOUR stars for longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a paper sample of this in a magazine, and I could tell just by opening the envelope that it was the fragrance I have been looking for. I was a gigantic Cool Citrus Basil fan of Bath and Body Works and was so disappointed when that scent was discontinued there.  If you liked that fragrance, you will LOVE Pure Verbena.  It is a clean, \\&quot;just showered\\&quot; scent, Irish Springy type scent.  Very fresh.  I can spray it all over and it is not overwhelming or heavy at all.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last terribly long.  But I bought the 3 ounce bottle, and plan to purchase again when this runs out.</li>
    <li> My fave scent.  So happy I was able to find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> My 15 year old wanted this perfume. She loves it. It was also a good value. We always check Amazons pricing before buying anything. We do not like to go to the mall &amp; Amazon makes it easy.</li>
    <li> I like it. Smell fresh. But doesn&#x27;t last long. Still its very flowery and fresh and light. Its very good.</li>
    <li> I almost never buy perfume but I tried a sample of this and liked it.  It&#x27;s got a really nice scent… complex but not overpowering.  My only complaint, if it is one, is that it goes on strong and fades relatively quickly.  I have to use a bit more than I&#x27;d like to get the effect I want 10 minutes later.  But I avoid people for that first 10 minutes!</li>
    <li> I love this!! It smells like summer in such a light and beautiful way. I&#x27;m a Verbena freak and you can find those notes in this scent. I was also surprised that they included a free lotion. I layer this with the lotion because it is light enough and makes it last longer. I&#x27;m not sure if the scent wears off or I just get used to it, so I will take the lotion with me for touch up.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding fragrances.  I don&#x27;t want anything too heavy.  I like my scents to be personal, not a chemical assault on those nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pureDKNY Verbena is a lovely, personal, floral scent.  I spritz it on my wrists in the morning and it dries down to a very subtle floral that keeps me happy all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would classify this as a floral fragrance, and florals are at the top of my fragrance list.  I don&#x27;t get much Verbena, but I do love this scent.  It  has base notes of amber and sandalwood, but those don&#x27;t come through for me either.  I&#x27;m just overwhelmed with delight by the florals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect fragrance for a warm spring day.  It makes me want to find a soft breeze, grab a good book, and inhale the essence of Pure Verbena.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is light and crisp with a clean easy feeling. I was completely surprised when it came with a body lotion included. A plus!!!!</li>
    <li> Just what my girlfriend wanted and since I had a coupon I bought it at an amazing price. Much lower than the stores or even Amazon originally priced it. It was a decent price from Amazon but better with my coupon. Glad I made her happy and saved money at the same time. Original price was nothing compared to WalMart. WalMart didn&#x27;t have it so I found it here.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I get compliments all the time wearing this! Love the fresh clean scent! Not over powering just perfect! It&#x27;s day or night scent!</li>
    <li> Love everything about this purchase.  Love the perfume; the packaging was good; the price was fair.  Will def look to Amazon for future fragrance purchases.</li>
    <li> It smells divine! Perfumes tend to bother me, but not this fragrance. Love it!! Would recommend to all that enjoy a light clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> I usually prefer florals, but I got a sample of this and liked it so much I ordered it.  It&#x27;s a great scent for everyday - especially for work since it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, I have had it before and will continue to buy this.  it&#x27;s a very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;I would definately advise other people to buy this.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. The touch of verbena makes the difference. Complete strangers compliment me. So happy I found a fragrance that I love!</li>
    <li> I originally smelled this on a magazine insert.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anywhere (seasonal item) so I ordered it online.  It smells very strong, and not as pleasant when first applied.  It softens and smells much better about an hour or so after, and the pleasant scent lingers for most of the day.  I try to remember to put it on as soon as I get out of the shower, so by the time I leave the house it wears off a little.</li>
    <li> I sprayed this scent on my wrist at one of the department stores... After I left the store, I kept smelling it over and over and I loved the scent and just had to have it.  I was looking for a new fragrance to call my own.  This is now it.</li>
    <li> There is a bad thing and a good one. The good thing I was ordered just the 1.7 oz fragrance, but it arrived as a gift set with a lotion! The lotion smells really nice same exactly like the perfume. I used to had the same exact perfume but the liquid inside is clear like water. But the one i received the liquid is yellow. I don&#x27;t know if that mean that is fake or what!!! If any one could tell me i would be grateful.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. The scent is not too weak and not too strong. It smells clean, femanine, and sexy.</li>
    <li> This is great for spring or summer. Very fresh and clean smelling. It is different from any other fragrance I own.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my sister. She was happy with the gift and I was happy with the price.</li>
    <li> Ordered 1.7oz perfume and received that plus lotion and gift box, very surprised and pleased! Great value, fast delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I got a fake. I&#x27;ve seen the real thing and the liquid inside is clear like water. Mine has a yellow tint to it. Shame because this was the first perfume I decided to try because I&#x27;m new to perfume and was told this is a good first perfume; yet, I ended up not getting a real one.</li>
    <li> The moment I smelled a sample of this in a Kohl&#x27;s mailer I knew I had to have a bottle. I&#x27;m not a huge wearer of perfume, but this one hooked me not only by my senses, but somehow emotionally as well. It evoked a feeling that I had when I was a child on a spring day. Freedom, the smell of fresh air and sunshine, the sounds of nature, running water, the smell of the water. I don&#x27;t know how they did it, but it takes me to another time and place that was free from stress and worry. The body cream is fabulous as well!  What a treat!  Thank you, DKNY!</li>
    <li> My wife wore this and it made my heart go pitter patter. I would reccomend this to any guy wanting to give a great perfume to their significate other</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! It is light and clean smelling, not too heavy or flowery. It&#x27;s hard to find, but worth the search!</li>
    <li> Was for My Daughter for her Birthday and it was at a very reasonable price plus free shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves the fragrance and it was a very easy purchase</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted perfume w vervain in it bc it keeps vampires from compelling u. :) she loves the scent of this perfume so I geuss that&#x27;s a bonus!</li>
