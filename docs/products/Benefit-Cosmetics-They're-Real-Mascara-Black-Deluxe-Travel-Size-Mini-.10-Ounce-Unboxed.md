      <li>Good color, matched my skin well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try it with primer to see if it might help, but by itself, I did not have good luck and don&#x27;t see the hype that comes with it.  </li>

      <li>My favorite mascara :)</li>
      <li>I LOVE Benefit cosmetics!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also more affordable price.</li>
      <li>then I would always use it :)</li>
      <li>My Loreal works better.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>I read all the reviews and bought it because it had so many stars.  </li>
      <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>love it and recommended to everybody</li>
      <li>but as soon as I tried the mascara it was like magic.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I use it on top and bottom depending on the look</li>
      <li>So many people swear by it</li>
      <li>it again too many words needed for a review on the site.  </li>
      <li>The more coats the longer and fuller my lashes got without clumping.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this and continue to buy it always.</li>
      <li>but I just love this mascara.</li>
      <li>Works best if your lashes are already long.</li>
      <li>Price is not bad for how amazing this is.</li>
      <li>It can fit anywhere and everywhere, and plumps up the lashes no matter how many coats you already have on.</li>
      <li>Definitely glad I didn&#x27;t spend $25 on a full size bottle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ladies, this is hands down the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
      <li>They are short and curly and after hearing so many good things about this mascara, I was really looking forward to some good length.</li>
      <li>This is the best everyday mascara I&#x27;ve found however.</li>
      <li>I use eye makeup remover and will still wake up with a light layer of smeared mascara under my eyes.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and dries looking cakey.</li>
      <li>My lashes are thinning and this mascara does the best at making my lashes look natural/real, long, accenting the positive without glops to fill in.</li>
      <li>Inside tip though, buy the cheaper trial size, clean &amp; re-use the brush with any (cheaper) mascara of your choice.</li>
      <li>Makes my lashes look beautiful if applied modestly, but tends to clump and flake if you&#x27;re looking for a more dynamic lash look.  </li>
      <li>some of my favorite mascara, just make sure to have a good eye makeup remover because it&#x27;s tough to get off :)</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an awesome more expensive mascara, go with Benefits &amp;#34;Bad Girl.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>This WOULD be the perfect mascara if it was not so darn hard to get of !</li>
      <li>great for everyday wear.  </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s the tradeoff for more natural looking.  </li>
      <li>This is still my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>my eyelashes look great, long and separated, very natural.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I thought I would try this myself after hearing nothing but bad reviews from my friends thinking maybe I would have good luck, especially given that Ulta workers have told me that this is the best selling mascara nationwide.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my 2nd favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>First time I bought the mascara</li>
      <li>the product is better protected from drying up &amp; really, several of the samples are equally priced per ounce compared to the full product--- smart eh?</li>
      <li>Tried a few tricks to see if using primer or serum first would improve appearance, putting on foundation first and loose powder on top as well as applying with fingertip and sponge blender, nothing able to produce a satisfactory effect and appearance.</li>
      <li>really does give a &#x27;real&#x27; look - not clumpy or goopy like some mascaras.  </li>
      <li>they&#x27;re real....</li>
      <li>Will not buy again; requires too much maintenance.</li>
      <li>It increases volume and length, while being softer and easier to remove than They&#x27;re Real.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth even after multiple coats.</li>
      <li>Application was very goopy, had globs sitting on my lids and lashes even after scraping a lot off the brush, even my lower lids and lashes.  </li>
      <li>It makes my lashes look so much longer and fuller without looking clumpy.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>AND I REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
      <li>The &#x27;They&#x27;re Real&#x27;</li>
      <li>I prefer the smaller sample tube over the large full size.</li>
      <li>I hear the sample size is the way to go with this product from many other makeup lovers as the full size tends to get dry and clumpy soon after opening</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always worth the extra money</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, gives decent length, just not much thickness.</li>
      <li>Even when I wipe off extra mascara off the brush it still applies way too much product in one coat.</li>
      <li>is by far my favorite&lt;br</li>
      <li>A beauty supply store near me used to carry this mascara</li>
      <li>but then after years of success the owners retired and the store closed.</li>
      <li>the funky little applicator really does get in there and separate the lashes better than any other brush I have tried to date.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Luv it best one out there!!! Stays on alllllll day !!!</li>
    <li> Excellent and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;This is by far my favorite&lt;br /&gt;Awesome brush with little ball type bristles on end to get those little corner eyelashes and bottoms 😉</li>
    <li> Gives great length for older thinning lashes!</li>
    <li> Kind of disappointed. I did a LOT of research to find the perfect mascara for my lashes. They are short and curly and after hearing so many good things about this mascara, I was really looking forward to some good length. First off, I received this mascara, tube alone, with an annoying barcodes sticker sealing it together. Not very sanitary in my opinion because how do you know it hasn&#x27;t been used? Also, the sticker was a pain to get off. I then went to apply and it is so dry that it hardly came off the wand! Not worth the 15 dollars whatsoever, continue the search.</li>
    <li> All time favorite mascara from a self proclaimed expert!  Purchase the mini samples-- the product is better protected from drying up &amp; really, several of the samples are equally priced per ounce compared to the full product--- smart eh?</li>
    <li> The only mascara I buy now. Strangers actually ask me on a regular basis about my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush! Inside tip though, buy the cheaper trial size, clean &amp; re-use the brush with any (cheaper) mascara of your choice. It&#x27;s all about the brush so don&#x27;t waste your money buying the mascara again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Love makes my eyes look wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  Follow the directions and you will be amazed by the results!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and bought it because it had so many stars.  I was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t leave with &amp;#34;Rocky Raccoon eyes&amp;#34;.  Unfortunately it does.  It&#x27;s also hard to remove.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t enhance curl, does make lashes look thicker and longer, does smear some and requires cleanup of surrounding eye area after application. Works well with a heated curler.</li>
    <li> I do not understand the appeal of this mascara. So many people swear by it so I decided to give it is a try in the travel size. I don&#x27;t like the rubber/plastic style brushes, but I thought this one might be different. Even when I wipe off extra mascara off the brush it still applies way too much product in one coat. Not a fan. It is no different than the drugstore $5.00 tubes. I will stick with my Almay mascara.</li>
    <li> I hear the sample size is the way to go with this product from many other makeup lovers as the full size tends to get dry and clumpy soon after opening so I gave this a shot and it is love! Also more affordable price.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> The bristles on the wand are horrible.  They hurt.  They don&#x27;t apply evenly.  If you&#x27;re looking for an awesome more expensive mascara, go with Benefits &amp;#34;Bad Girl.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara ever! Hands down! I will definitely buy it again. It&#x27;s always worth the extra money</li>
    <li> some of my favorite mascara, just make sure to have a good eye makeup remover because it&#x27;s tough to get off :)</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE Benefit cosmetics!&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, this is hands down the best mascara I have ever used. I was fortunate enough to be an Ipsy/Benefit Glambassador last month, and give a few of these out to my girlfriends! Give it a shot, and you will be amazed!</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re real.... NUFF SAID ;) lol just get it</li>
    <li> Great lengthening mascara. It&#x27;s my 2nd favorite mascara. I tend to use my #1 mascara on the top lashes and use this one on the bottom because the brush is incredible to lengthen and separate the bottom lashes. Sometimes I use it on top and bottom depending on the look I&#x27;m going for. When I want night time dramatic I reach for the fiber mascara instead. This is the best everyday mascara I&#x27;ve found however.</li>
    <li> This mascara works! A beauty supply store near me used to carry this mascara but then after years of success the owners retired and the store closed. I could not find this mascara anywhere. A friend told me to check Amazon, and, yep! Finally! This mascara enhances your lashes without clumps so the name is very appropriate. For those wanting to try this mascara get the Travel size and see what you think. My lashes are thinning and this mascara does the best at making my lashes look natural/real, long, accenting the positive without glops to fill in.</li>
    <li> This is the best, and I don&#x27;t even wear falsies but I just love this mascara.I bought an extra just so I can&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this and continue to buy it always. Price is not bad for how amazing this is. Make ur lashed look deep and black and long.  I love it</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Goes on smooth even after multiple coats. The more coats the longer and fuller my lashes got without clumping.</li>
    <li> Loved it will&lt;br /&gt;Use it again too many words needed for a review on the site.  This is cra cra. Lpl</li>
    <li> its fine, kinda thick</li>
    <li> Clumps but good product</li>
    <li> I love love love my benefit mascara!! Immediately my eyes look like I have false lashes on without the clown look that false lashes give. No clumping and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> MY NIECE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS MASCARA, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY IT.  I RECEIVED IT IN A TIMELY MANNER AND TRIED IT OUT AND I REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> I saw reviews for this mascara, and decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s not bad, gives decent length, just not much thickness. It&#x27;s also relatively difficult to remove- I use eye makeup remover and will still wake up with a light layer of smeared mascara under my eyes. I usually buy Benefit Bad a Gal Lash and will go back to buying that in the future. It increases volume and length, while being softer and easier to remove than They&#x27;re Real.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the amount of applications I got out of this for the price I spent.</li>
    <li> I think this is inferior to DiorShow.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product until I tried it.  It is the  BOMB!  Love the dark, dark color and the funky little applicator really does get in there and separate the lashes better than any other brush I have tried to date.  I am SOLD!</li>
    <li> Best Mascara ever! love it and recommended to everybody I know! my eyelashes look great, long and separated, very natural. It lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  Plan to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this mascara at all. And the fact they call it &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real!&amp;#34; is a joke. My Loreal works better. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is still my favorite so far. The best way to buy this is in the mini sized one if one can. The price is best. I yet have not really found any that works as well considering the thickness and length added to the lashes, as well as the extremely long length of time such lasts, in comparison to all others that I have tried so far. I speak of this in an episode of Modeling With Ishah Wright that I star in on IMDb TV.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect mascara.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for my lashes</li>
    <li> I could happily use Benefit or all my cosmetics! The &#x27;They&#x27;re Real&#x27; mascara is perfect!</li>
    <li> Wife loved it, can&#x27;t say more than that</li>
    <li> really does give a &#x27;real&#x27; look - not clumpy or goopy like some mascaras.  not super dramatic like I usually like, but that&#x27;s the tradeoff for more natural looking.  great for everyday wear.  :)</li>
    <li> I ordered it one day and it came the next!   I really like this mascara in the smaller version because it doesn&#x27;t get dry.  It brings out  lashes you didn&#x27;t know you had and it does last.!   Good service and good product.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this myself after hearing nothing but bad reviews from my friends thinking maybe I would have good luck, especially given that Ulta workers have told me that this is the best selling mascara nationwide.  I&#x27;ve never actually seen anyone use it regularly, despite all this hype.  Application was very goopy, had globs sitting on my lids and lashes even after scraping a lot off the brush, even my lower lids and lashes.  My lashes also clumped together.  I&#x27;m going to try it with primer to see if it might help, but by itself, I did not have good luck and don&#x27;t see the hype that comes with it.  Definitely glad I didn&#x27;t spend $25 on a full size bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this Mascara!!! it definitely is my fav out of all iv tried (which is a lot.) It makes my lashes look so much longer and fuller without looking clumpy. I prefer the smaller sample tube over the large full size. I think it lasts longer without drying out.</li>
    <li> First time I bought the mascara I was a little skeptical about the wand/applicator but as soon as I tried the mascara it was like magic. My lashes look amazing and people always compliment them.&lt;br /&gt;It may not be waterproof, but I promise it is not coming off until you take it off!&lt;br /&gt;This is the best mascara that I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brands and this is by far the best!  Love, love this product!!</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected , just as advertised ,</li>
    <li> A small on the go mascara that is well worth the price. It can fit anywhere and everywhere, and plumps up the lashes no matter how many coats you already have on.</li>
    <li> Makes my lashes look beautiful if applied modestly, but tends to clump and flake if you&#x27;re looking for a more dynamic lash look.  Biggest drawback is that it smudges under the eyes very easily and throughout the day.  Will not buy again; requires too much maintenance.</li>
    <li> This WOULD be the perfect mascara if it was not so darn hard to get of !&lt;br /&gt;If that was not the case then I would always use it :)&lt;br /&gt;The plus side there is that if you need to keep it on for a long day you know it won´t wear off ;)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying any other mascara again, with the money! Needs makeup remover but no biggie!</li>
    <li> Works best if your lashes are already long. If you have short skimpy lashes this will not make them longer. Rather pricey I thought for what it did. Brush was rather different though. Helped reach those little lashes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and dries looking cakey. Good color, matched my skin well. Tried a few tricks to see if using primer or serum first would improve appearance, putting on foundation first and loose powder on top as well as applying with fingertip and sponge blender, nothing able to produce a satisfactory effect and appearance. The search for a good concealer continues.</li>
