      <li>if you don&#x27;t care what it feels like, this is a good product for sun-protection.</li>
      <li>This is not sunblock, it&#x27;s sunscreen, but it was just as good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick/creamy, but its not any more then a good hand lotion.</li>
      <li>so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super happy</li>
      <li>good product, fast shipping, happy customer :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands and</li>
      <li>The kids love it-</li>
      <li>(most all 100s are, I think)</li>
      <li>I personally believe that there is no sunscreen that can protect 100% from midday sun from 12 p.m.- 4 p.m., but this one helps the best.</li>
      <li>I love the sea and sun and</li>
      <li>I love how well this sunblock works for my type two albino child.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>His skin is so fair that he burns super easy.</li>
      <li>Amazing to know that BB is a full time participant in creating mixes year after year to contain ingredients that cause Cancer, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Organ system toxicity, on and on...</li>
      <li>personally don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any sunblock that is truly 100% sun-proof, but this stuff is FANTASTIC and the best I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
      <li>I personally don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any sunblock that is truly 100 percent sun-proof, but this stuff is FANTASTIC and the best I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
      <li>It rubs in easily</li>
      <li>Does not wash off easily in the pool.</li>
      <li>seems to work fine</li>
      <li>the BANANA BOAT Kid&#x27;s Sunblock is clearly effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;Allows  me to go sailing and swim in the sea and not suffer the effctos of too much sun on my skin</li>
      <li>can\\&quot; stuff that just adds a light mist of sunblock.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe in that &amp;#34;spray can&amp;#34; sunblock as it just adds a light mist of sunblock.</li>
      <li>My 14 year old granddaughter has fair skin and needs a killer sunblock.  </li>
      <li>My 3 year old son has fair skin too.</li>
      <li>I am extremely fair skinned and sensitive so on the plus</li>
      <li>A full 80 min&#x27;s is accurate for the protection time.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist told me that a good sunscreen is necessary when you use Retin-A that works to prevent aging like I do.</li>
      <li>I have tried different sunblock/sunscreens and this is the first one I have really liked and believed it was doing its job.</li>
      <li>Bring back the 100 SPF because it does protect much better than the lower SPF&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>and I can safely that this product is terrific, just like the Ultra Defense MAX.</li>
      <li>It really blocks out the sun well!</li>
      <li>Great, does the job, but is thick</li>
      <li>We love to be outdoors and do countless activities like swim, play on the swing-set, in the sandbox, yard work, garden, etc.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to reapply this as much as other sunscreens either, which is nice because I literally have to wrestle my son to get his neck or tummy.</li>
      <li>The spray can might be good for re-application, just for extra protection, but I don&#x27;t rely on it for the INITIAL sunblock application.</li>
      <li>The spray can might be good for after-swim exposure, just for extra protection, but I don&#x27;t rely on it for the initial sunblock application).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;That is an amazing amount of chemicals especially when few are almost banned by many cosmetic producers.</li>
      <li>Amazing how some individuals can put this on a their kids when the kid&#x27;s liver will be absorbing all those inactive and active ingredients and dumping it into their blood stream.</li>
      <li>My entire family is super white and burns super easily.</li>
      <li>I really like it for my kids that are running under the sun the whole day and splashing here and there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This used to be available in local stores</li>
      <li>(Please note that I use it liberally, like lotion, taking the time to really rub it in at the beginning of the day. . .</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.. the only sunblock that doesn&#x27;t sting her eyes.  </li>
      <li>It really helps the kids stay unburned as well as us adults.</li>
      <li>Please understand I use this lotion liberally, taking the time to really rub it in at the beginning of the day.</li>
      <li>Really works well and lasts.</li>
      <li>This means most days we have zero cloud cover and direct sun exposure all day long.</li>
      <li>It really offers a 100 protection, it is not greasy and is odorless, I really recommend it!</li>
      <li>I missed a spot one day and got super burned, but where I had put the sun, I was perfectly white.</li>
      <li>But if he forgets his own lotion and uses other brands he comes home with red nose.</li>
      <li>no complaint.  </li>
      <li>I normally use mineral based sunscreens, but I couldn&#x27;t resist trying this 100 SPF when I saw it at Wally World.</li>
      <li>I live in the desert and purchased this for my grandkids ,ages 3 -11 .</li>
      <li>I can assure, being over 50 years old and boating at a high elevation in the summer</li>
      <li>I did my research thoroughly and it appears that the ingredients in this product are the exact same ingredients in their Ultra Defense.</li>
      <li>Good product; it goes on as dry as any lotion I&#x27;ve used lately</li>
      <li>My husband uses it too when he plays soccer from 9 to 11:30, he puts his on his face and especially nose and works very well</li>
      <li>Used this on my 1 year old at Disney for a week.</li>
      <li>This exclusive, tear-free, sting-free formula lets them run around outside safely protected from the sun – without irritating their young eyes.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We live in Texas where the sun beams down hotter than it does in Michigan, where we used to live.</li>
      <li>Even though we live in Maine, the last week has been a heat wave, so my son and I have been to the lake every other day during 85-90+ degree sunny weather.</li>

<li> They play all day outside, doing water sports on the lake like boating, tubing, waterslides, and countless other outdoor activities.  </li>

<li> We were out on the playground for a couple of hours and came home without any signs of pink skin other than flushed cheeks!</li>
<li> and it wasn&#x27;t thick enough</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t as sticky as some of the other sunblock we have used, but it does take a little bit of rubbing to get it thoroughly applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This product do protect your skin from the sun, but it quite creamy and heavy,</li>
<li> I have used this before a few years ago.  </li>
<li> Also, she has quite a few allergies</li>
<li> My toddler is a pale child growing up in the Arizona.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a little sad that Banana Boat has stopped making their Ultra Defense MAX Sheer Protect in the lotion version.</li>
<li> Rated as one of the worst chemical mixes out there, BB has been able to achieve the highest score in EWG chemical ingredient list.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very hard to find in my area (Northern Virginia)</li>
<li> the morning I slather (yes, it is VERY thick)</li>
<li> there are no fragrances because there is nothing I hate more than smothering myself in some nasty coconut chemical smelling sunscreen during bug season!</li>
<li> After I used this my skin broke out in a terrible red rash.  </li>
<li> I find this product difficult to locate in stores.</li>
<li> but this is the real deal since they offer the worst of worst ingredients in the mix.</li>
<li> Baby and husband also got burns, but not as bad.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t burn but this is bad if you have eczema</li>
<li> Peace of mind with this bad boy.</li>
<li> Never found it :(</li>

    <li> My daughter is extremely fair and she is attending summer camp almost every week this summer.  They play all day outside, doing water sports on the lake like boating, tubing, waterslides, and countless other outdoor activities.  I just want to say that this Banana Boat Kids Sunblock Lotion, SPF 100 is the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used. In the morning I slather it on her face, arms and legs, and at the end of the day she comes back with NO SUNBURN AT ALL. . . and this is even after hours of continual exposure to water sports and swimming.  I personally don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any sunblock that is truly 100 percent sun-proof, but this stuff is FANTASTIC and the best I&#x27;ve found yet. (Please note that I use it liberally, like lotion, taking the time to really rub it in at the beginning of the day. . . I don&#x27;t believe in that \\&quot;spray can\\&quot; stuff that just adds a light mist of sunblock.  I&#x27;ve tried that before on her and it wasn&#x27;t thick enough so it didn&#x27;t protect her skin from burning after several hours.  The spray can might be good for after-swim exposure, just for extra protection, but I don&#x27;t rely on it for the initial sunblock application).  This lotion is GREAT!</li>
    <li> Great, does the job, but is thick (most all 100s are, I think)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a kid but I use this sunscreen all the time especially for my face.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands and this is the only one I have tried that doesn&#x27;t burn and sting the eyes.  It rubs in easily so you don&#x27;t look like you are covered in diaper cream.  It&#x27;s very hard to find in my area (Northern Virginia) so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product for kids and adults.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works well. It is quite thick and takes a little bit of time to really rub it in, but it lasts well through sweat and water play. It was a good price compared to in-store prices too!</li>
    <li> I wore this when I went out to Disneyland. I put it on 2 days in a row and I broke out into itchy eczema wherever I put it. I am extremely fair skinned and sensitive so on the plus I didn&#x27;t burn but this is bad if you have eczema</li>
    <li> Really works well and lasts. Used it running around a water park and no one got burned.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion because it is water-prove, so I do not have to reapply it after swimming. I use it when we go to the lake and my children stay in water in the open sun all day long. They still get tanned, but they are not burned.  My husband uses it too when he plays soccer from 9 to 11:30, he puts his on his face and especially nose and works very well and he comes home tanned. But if he forgets his own lotion and uses other brands he comes home with red nose. I personally believe that there is no sunscreen that can protect 100% from midday sun from 12 p.m.- 4 p.m., but this one helps the best.</li>
    <li> We live in Texas where the sun beams down hotter than it does in Michigan, where we used to live. So a good sunscreen is a MUST HAVE. I&#x27;m a little sad that Banana Boat has stopped making their Ultra Defense MAX Sheer Protect in the lotion version. I&#x27;ve found it for sale, but people are charging just under $20.00 and up for the SPF 30 in the 8 oz. size. I use too much sunscreen everyday to pay such an exorbitant price. When I could find it locally, I was paying around the same price for the SPF 100 lotion that I paid for this product. My dermatologist told me that a good sunscreen is necessary when you use Retin-A that works to prevent aging like I do. I did my research thoroughly and it appears that the ingredients in this product are the exact same ingredients in their Ultra Defense. So I&#x27;ve been using Kids MAX for close to a month now and I can safely that this product is terrific, just like the Ultra Defense MAX. It really blocks out the sun well!</li>
    <li> Horrible Product.  After I used this my skin broke out in a terrible red rash.  I will NEVER buy anything from this company again.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I get it every year.  It really helps the kids stay unburned as well as us adults.</li>
    <li> The product title is misleading, and this is NOT a sunblock. This is a sunscreen, and applying this to my son&#x27;s face did not prevent him from getting tanned.</li>
    <li> Good product; it goes on as dry as any lotion I&#x27;ve used lately but the price has me unsure about purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> good product, fast shipping, happy customer :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a redhead and I start burning in about 5 min&#x27;s. My 3 year old son has fair skin too. I normally use mineral based sunscreens, but I couldn&#x27;t resist trying this 100 SPF when I saw it at Wally World. I&#x27;m so glad I did! Even though we live in Maine, the last week has been a heat wave, so my son and I have been to the lake every other day during 85-90+ degree sunny weather. No burns at all! I don&#x27;t have to reapply this as much as other sunscreens either, which is nice because I literally have to wrestle my son to get his neck or tummy. A full 80 min&#x27;s is accurate for the protection time. I like that there are no fragrances because there is nothing I hate more than smothering myself in some nasty coconut chemical smelling sunscreen during bug season! Next time I buy this I will get it from Amazon. It was $10 at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Is not easyto fin a Sunblock lotion SPF 100. I really like it for my kids that are running under the sun the whole day and splashing here and there.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather like a bigger presentation.  Never found it :(</li>
    <li> I have used this before a few years ago.  I think their formula changed.  My son said it stung him when I applied it to his face.  After the 2nd time I bought something else.  I tried it on myself and it got in my eyes while swimming and the sting was awful for hours after the incident.  My husband had the same problem when he put it on his face.  We tossed it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> My toddler is a pale child growing up in the Arizona. This means most days we have zero cloud cover and direct sun exposure all day long. We love to be outdoors and do countless activities like swim, play on the swing-set, in the sandbox, yard work, garden, etc.  I just want to say that this Banana Boat Kids Sunblock Lotion, SPF 100 is the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used. It isn&#x27;t as sticky as some of the other sunblock we have used, but it does take a little bit of rubbing to get it thoroughly applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning I slather (yes, it is VERY thick) it on her face, ears, arms, back, chest and legs, and at the end of the day she has NO SUNBURN AT ALL. . . and this is even after hours of continual exposure to sun, sweat and water.  We were out on the playground for a couple of hours and came home without any signs of pink skin other than flushed cheeks! Please understand I use this lotion liberally, taking the time to really rub it in at the beginning of the day. (Side note, I have it delivered every month with my Amazon Prime account even though the recommendation is every 3 months.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any sunblock that is truly 100% sun-proof, but this stuff is FANTASTIC and the best I&#x27;ve found yet. I have tried different sunblock/sunscreens and this is the first one I have really liked and believed it was doing its job. I don&#x27;t believe in that &amp;#34;spray can&amp;#34; sunblock as it just adds a light mist of sunblock. I&#x27;ve tried that before and didn&#x27;t protect my toddler&#x27;s skin from burning. The spray can might be good for re-application, just for extra protection, but I don&#x27;t rely on it for the INITIAL sunblock application.</li>
    <li> I find this product difficult to locate in stores. I love the smell and it works perfectly to prevent sunburn.</li>
    <li> Awful. Used it for a 60 min mid afternoon pool trip and I am now lobster red. Baby and husband also got burns, but not as bad. Maybe if you reapply every 30 minutes and stay in the shade, it works, but not as directed.</li>
    <li> My entire family is super white and burns super easily. We took this with us to Mexico and none of us got burnt. We applied it every 2-3 hours. It definitely works.</li>
    <li> Even the marketing claims of SPF 100 did not help this mix to get the time of the day. Rated as one of the worst chemical mixes out there, BB has been able to achieve the highest score in EWG chemical ingredient list. Amazing to know that BB is a full time participant in creating mixes year after year to contain ingredients that cause Cancer, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Organ system toxicity, on and on... On Banana Boat&#x27;s Website they claim &amp;#34;&amp;#34;All in Favor, Say Eyes! This exclusive, tear-free, sting-free formula lets them run around outside safely protected from the sun – without irritating their young eyes.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTIVE: Avobenzone 2.5%; Octocrylene 8%; Oxybenzone 3.5%&lt;br /&gt;INACTIVE: Water; Hydrogenated Polyisobutene; Lauryl PEG-8 Dimethicone; Butyloctyl Salicylate; Ethylhexyl Palmitate; Hydrated Silica; Cyclopentasiloxane; Cyclohexasiloxane; Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A); Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C); Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E); PEG-8 Dimethicone; Sodium Propoxyhydroxypropyl Thiosulfate Silica; Octyldodecanol; Silica; Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice; Beeswax; Disodium EDTA; Microcrystalline Wax; Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer; Sodium Chloride; Polyethylene; Stearoxy Dimethicone; Caprylyl Glycol; Benzyl Alcohol; Methylparaben; Propylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is an amazing amount of chemicals especially when few are almost banned by many cosmetic producers. Ingredients like PARABEN which mimic estrogen and can act as potential hormone (endocrine) system disruptors. Amazing how some individuals can put this on a their kids when the kid&#x27;s liver will be absorbing all those inactive and active ingredients and dumping it into their blood stream. I wish there was a waterproof sunscreen with SPF 100, there is no such thing and anything over SPF 30 is a gimmick but this is the real deal since they offer the worst of worst ingredients in the mix. If I could get my hand on SPF 100 which would protect me from the sun without harming my health, I would have never come out of the ocean to protect my skin every forty minutes. Shame.ever come out of the ocean to protect my skin every forty minutes. Shame.</li>
    <li> no complaint.  seems to work fine</li>
    <li> My 14 year old granddaughter has fair skin and needs a killer sunblock.  This used to be available in local stores but I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore so ordered it from Amazon.  Also, she has quite a few allergies and this doesn&#x27;t break her out.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love the sea and sun and the BANANA BOAT Kid&#x27;s Sunblock is clearly effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;Allows  me to go sailing and swim in the sea and not suffer the effctos of too much sun on my skin</li>
    <li> I love how well this sunblock works for my type two albino child. I never have to worry about her when she wears this</li>
    <li> This product do protect your skin from the sun, but it quite creamy and heavy, if you don&#x27;t care what it feels like, this is a good product for sun-protection.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.. the only sunblock that doesn&#x27;t sting her eyes.  SPF 50 always made her rosey after 3 hours in the sun and I would always forget to reapply.  Peace of mind with this bad boy.</li>
    <li> It is great! It really offers a 100 protection, it is not greasy and is odorless, I really recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen that works on my son.  His skin is so fair that he burns super easy.</li>
    <li> The kids love it- no tears. Very effective sunblock. Does not wash off easily in the pool. The only sunblock we use for the kids.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and purchased this for my grandkids ,ages 3 -11 . River run, daily use, baseball ,swimming, beach.This sunblock did the trick !</li>
    <li> Sunscreen performance is good, practical good.</li>
    <li> Product is as described.  I use it all over my face and have no problems with it burning my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is not sunblock, it&#x27;s sunscreen, but it was just as good. Used this on my 1 year old at Disney for a week. We were in the sun all day in Florida in July. She was well protected. I&#x27;m very fair and used this as well. I missed a spot one day and got super burned, but where I had put the sun, I was perfectly white. It&#x27;s thick/creamy, but its not any more then a good hand lotion. I&#x27;m super happy I used this and happy I found 100.</li>
    <li> Bring back the 100 SPF because it does protect much better than the lower SPF&#x27;s.  I can assure, being over 50 years old and boating at a high elevation in the summer, I definitely notice a difference if I use less than this 100 SPF.  Bring it back.</li>
