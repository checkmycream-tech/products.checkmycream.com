      <li>Highly recommend this soap!</li>
      <li>I would really like for them to offer their clove/lavender scent on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Synthetic soaps are made to last longer, but the chemicals are more costly than the price of natural soaps.</li>
      <li>The scent stayed with me for half the day and was very strong.  </li>
      <li>If you love black licorice...</li>
      <li>Scent is mild enough, yet a hint of it comes out in hugs or a gust of wind.</li>
      <li>The main issue I have is the smell.  </li>
      <li>but I took a star off for the high price.</li>
      <li>This soap also creates a thick lather which I guess is nice.</li>
      <li>I love all the Honest Amish products and I have never been disappointed in any that I have purchased.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although if you enjoy eating black licorice, you&#x27;ll probably be walking around hungry</li>
      <li>That is the way natural soaps are.</li>
      <li>The smell is subtle but pleasant as long as you like black licorice.</li>
      <li>Someone else may like the scent, but a little much for me.  </li>
      <li>The Licorice smell is quite strong on the bar; it&#x27;ll clear out your nostrils if you&#x27;re a moron like me and put it up against your nose right out of the box.</li>

    <li> I like Honest Amish soaps and this one works well.  The main issue I have is the smell.  I do like licorice, but WOW, this is strong.  The scent stayed with me for half the day and was very strong.  Someone else may like the scent, but a little much for me.  I would really like for them to offer their clove/lavender scent on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This has a great smell, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a nice thick lather going.  Does not leave my beard feeling dry. I love this product.</li>
    <li> The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars is the dark brown coloring that shows in our soap dish. Love the smell, it leaves the skin feeling so soft and someone I bought anise soap from before told me to use it on my baby-fine hair. My hair dresser couldn&#x27;t believe how thick it made my hair and wondered what I was using. If you love black licorice...you&#x27;ll love the smell.</li>
    <li> Great beard soap. I also use it for my hair. Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Not very strong scented. Was hoping for something very rich. Slimy. Uses up very quickly. Not my favorite soap, won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap. It&#x27;s lasted a lot longer than I expected too. I use it exclusively for my beard and wash it maybe every other day. The smell is subtle but pleasant as long as you like black licorice.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like Licorice don&#x27;t buy, if you do you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Works Great! Smells Great!  So much better than that slimy mass produced garbage. This is how soap is supposed to be</li>
    <li> This soap has a lovely smell and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. Skin feel clean and hydrated. Soap does leave a dark residue on your soap dish, but I don&#x27;t mind. Shipped on time. I love that the soap is natural but I took a star off for the high price.</li>
    <li> always high quality with honest Amish- they have not let me down. Scent is mild enough, yet a hint of it comes out in hugs or a gust of wind. Try their beard balm line, too!</li>
    <li> This soap has an earthy, wholesome quality, which I like.  I am using it on my hair, in hopes to restore the vigor of my follicles, for the strength and fullness of my hair that has declined with age.  Twice now I have used it as a shampoo and my hair now has a healthier feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I put four stars instead of five is that because of its large size it does not fit a soap dish, so storing it in a way that lets it dry between uses is not easy.  It would help if the bar were made thick instead of wide.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap and I can tell the difference between this and commercial soap. My face feels good and healthy! I will definitely buy again. I have their beard balm as well and completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> great for your skin and beard. scent is there but not overpowering. The soap also lasts for quite a while</li>
    <li> Loved this soap. The licorice smell is delicious. And that&#x27;s coming from someone who doesn&#x27;t even like to eat black licorice. This soap made me smell good and feel clean. It has tiny beads in it, I forgot what they&#x27;re called but they feel good against the skin. This soap also creates a thick lather which I guess is nice. I mostly enjoyed it because of the smell and texture. I could see myself buying it again.</li>
    <li> item is indeed just as pictured, but it is not a fisherman&#x27;s soap.  i&#x27;ve been buying fisherman&#x27;s soap for 20 years and they must be using a different recipe...  too pungent, leaves you smelling instead of washing off. can&#x27;t imagine anyone using it.&lt;br /&gt;threw it out.  total waste of money.</li>
    <li> The Licorice smell is quite strong on the bar; it&#x27;ll clear out your nostrils if you&#x27;re a moron like me and put it up against your nose right out of the box. I despaired a little bit, thinking that I&#x27;d be walking around smelling like a bag of black licorice, but after it&#x27;s applied it provides a nice, subtle fragrance that isn&#x27;t going to knock anyone (or you) over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although if you enjoy eating black licorice, you&#x27;ll probably be walking around hungry all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes well, and it seems like it&#x27;s going to last for quite awhile. Would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Bought as part of my husband&#x27;s Christmas gift. He absolutely loved the product, and we both agree the subtle licorice scent is appealing and masculine. Highly recommend this soap! Check out other products by Honest Amish, have yet to be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of licorice. Large bar of soap, almost too large to hold in my hand. It is a bit rough for exfoliation. I use this in the shower as soap and shampoo. It keeps my skin super soft and even though my hair needs trimmed of the split ends, it keeps the ends soft and smooth. I love all the Honest Amish products and I have never been disappointed in any that I have purchased. Some people have made the comment that the soaps do not last long enough. That is the way natural soaps are. Synthetic soaps are made to last longer, but the chemicals are more costly than the price of natural soaps.</li>
    <li> Smells great, rinses clean, and lathers awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it only lasted a month, and for $10 (w/ shipping), it&#x27;s just something that i can&#x27;t justify using on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Tired of products with ingredients and other nonsense you&#x27;ve never heard of? Great because I don&#x27;t see the point in buying products with tons of chemicals in it. This licorice soap from the Amish is quite great. It obviously smells like licorice. If you buy this and hate licorice to begin with then...you&#x27;re sad. This soap gets rid of almost everything I have managed to dirty myself up with. I work in a factory and get primer and crap on myself. This does an equal, if not BETTER job at getting rid of &#x27;gunk&#x27; than leading brands. It&#x27;s great for the beard and hair as well. It&#x27;s definitely worthy of cleaning everything! It&#x27;s really is organic and all of the ingredients are told to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The product was smaller than I thought. It did say that the soaps varied between 5.6 oz. to 6.4oz. I must have received the 5.6 oz. The soap goes away quicker than you think!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want more. I advise purchasing this.</li>
    <li> Smells just like licorice!</li>
    <li> Like the soap but because of its size it is difficult to manage</li>
