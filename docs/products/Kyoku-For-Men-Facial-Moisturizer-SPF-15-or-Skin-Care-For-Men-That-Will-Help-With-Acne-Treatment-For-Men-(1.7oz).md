      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I went to the friend of mine who is the most &amp;#34;fashion savvy&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>But I wish for a better and clearer product description.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this moisturizer works for some people</li>
      <li>Kyoku for Men Facial Moisturizer is a great product and a good replacement fot</li>
      <li>and perhaps there was something better out there.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several men&#x27;s face moisturizers with sunscreen, and this is the best of the bunch (under $20).</li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a better moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Out of everything in the Kyoku line, this is what I ended up liking the most.</li>
      <li>Maybe there IS something better.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely the best product out there for face moisturizing and sun protection combo.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>He loves the stuff, but can&#x27;t seem to justify buying more of it because of the price tag.</li>
      <li>I would buy again if it was a bit more inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Make sure to use &amp;#34;smaller than a dime&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Love it&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>For daily use and biking and snowboarding.&lt;br /&gt;Includes SPF 25 which is great for fair skinned people</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer in my face</li>
      <li>This moisturizer works very well and as a bonus, it has a very light pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I have used other moisturizers, this one is better than some I&#x27;ve tried, but not the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I looked into the best men&#x27;s lotions and this along with Kiehl&#x27;s consistently made the top ten.  </li>
      <li>Once you apply it and rub it into your skin, it dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
      <li>and I liked it very much.</li>
      <li>Upon first applying it, thee is definitely a nice matte look to your face instead of instant-grease-ball.</li>
      <li>Problem is you&#x27;ll be lucky to get more than a two -week run out of this tube.  </li>
      <li>Perfect face lotion and even has a little SPF in it.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent to it and leaves skin feeling amazing.</li>
      <li>guess the tube is not even filled for 30%!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to return this product</li>
      <li>moisturizer leaves my skin looking fresh and healthy.</li>
      <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy, not an overpowering scent to mask your aftershave or cologne, you really only need about a dime sized dollop.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>Still looking for that magical combo that does both right.</li>
      <li>Smooth, fresh feeling skin ever since I started using this!</li>
      <li>No greesy feeling, great product and lasts a long time</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that it adequately moisturizes without leaving a greasy feeling which is important when you&#x27;re wearing this all day.</li>
      <li>I love this as it goes on lightly and works really well.</li>
      <li>You can clearly tell that the company uses only the best ingredients.</li>
      <li>Clean smell and my husband brings it with him when he travels.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is light and quick to absorb.</li>
      <li>Most moisturizers are too greasy and either irritate my skin or don&#x27;t absorb very well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this moisturizer in my face</li>
    <li> Good facial moisturizer.  But for the price there&#x27;s hardly any product inside the bottle.  It&#x27;s all gone after 2 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s slight better than a few other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. Once you apply it and rub it into your skin, it dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. It has a mild, subtle smell that&#x27;s not feminine.    One thing I noticed about this moisturizer is that when you apply it it and start working it into your skin, it doesn&#x27;t spread very well--it dries and \\&quot;solidifies\\&quot; very quickly. So you have to used more of this than other moisturizers to cover your whole face. On top of this, the bottle when just purchased is not actually full--maybe 3/4 full.</li>
    <li> Work fairly good  .I am not an expert on moisturizers but I was happy with it&#x27;s moisturizing  effect, the only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is... it has an ingredient in it  that burns the eyes when any lil perspiration occur around the eye area..., that not what other moisturizes I have here does ..</li>
    <li> it works nice and perfect. even it&#x27;s a pricy compare to other products.&lt;br /&gt;using that for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended it for everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have always had the typical pale, oily, acne ridden skin that simply couldn&#x27;t be helped.  Most moisturizers are too greasy and either irritate my skin or don&#x27;t absorb very well.  This product is perfect.  It absorbs well and gives my skin a good amount of moisture without leaving behind a greasy film.  I&#x27;ve never found any other product that performs this well on my terrible skin.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about it. Purchased another line</li>
    <li> For my sensitive, dry skin perfect. Good protection and care for day and night. Have tested almost everything on the market, will stay with this product.</li>
    <li> What a great moisturizer. Won&#x27;t cause excess oil and makes your face feel refreshed. I recommend it to any guy with any type of skin.</li>
    <li> Out of everything in the Kyoku line, this is what I ended up liking the most. I felt like everything was made for oily skin, and this didn&#x27;t moisturize that well, but it kept my face from getting too oily and provided sun protection and I liked that. Mine was also tinted green, and seemed to help with redness.</li>
    <li> Like the Kyoku Daily Facial Cleanser this product works really well and has a noticeable effect on my skin, however it is a little on the expensive and I can no longer afford it at this time.</li>
    <li> I have since switched to an OZ naturals moisturizer. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this works well. It is just a little overpriced for such a small size. If you only need a little bit from time to time then by all means, you will like this product. If you intend on using everyday I would suggest buying a larger size elsewhere though.</li>
    <li> Just started to try today. The moisturizer is light and quick to absorb. Very nice.  But I wish for a better and clearer product description. This one also contains SPF15. I was hoping for one to use at night.</li>
    <li> This came as a strong recommendation from a friend, but the whole product line is terrible and over-priced. The moisturizer actually increased breakouts and leaves an oily residue like cheap sunscreen lotion while leaving skin still dry, red and irritated. I used the entire product line according to their instructions and I&#x27;ve had better results with other less expensive products.  The company doesn&#x27;t stand behind their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this and spend it on trying something else.</li>
    <li> Keep looking, this is a disappointment</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kiehls Facial Fuel for years - absolutely amazing stuff in every way.  I figured maybe I was just in a rut and perhaps there was something better out there.  Found the Kyoku and the reviews were thru the roof.  Maybe there IS something better.  Gave it a shot and wasn&#x27;t super impressed.  It&#x27;s OK for a high grade facial moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t one-up the Kiehls in any way.  Kiehls is lighter weight, goes on lighter, smells betters, and feels less &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.  The Kyoku isn&#x27;t bad - it&#x27;s just not as good.</li>
    <li> Tried a handful of other moisturizers with SPF before trying this one and have been using it for a couple years now.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> It only takes a little and it rubs in fast.  I pretty much use Kyoku&#x27;s entire product line.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my partner as part of a gift. He loves the stuff, but can&#x27;t seem to justify buying more of it because of the price tag. (He did however, convert to the kyoku moisturizing scrub, which he deemed more reasonably priced.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has challenging skin and deals with both acne and eczema semi-regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might just have to make him another gift.</li>
    <li> Opened the package and took off the seal of the tube, squeezed the tube and heard air coming out. Squeezed harder and some moisturizer trickled out. Shook the tube and heard some fluid flopping around!&lt;br /&gt;I guess the tube is not even filled for 30%!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to return this product, it is a $30 scam!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job and has a sun-protector also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its easily absorbed by skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You feel refreshed after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the tube contains very small amount of the substance making it overall a expensive skin care item.</li>
    <li> Good, basic packaging without any mess while using. Product is very rich and creamy feeling and does seem to go a long way. Unfortunately, I find that my face starts to feel tight and dry within a few hours of use and my skin does not tend to be very dry.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helping but it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  Leads me to believe it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Got this for my fiancé who normally doesn&#x27;t put much effort into purchasing products like this. This is a great quality lotion. Works well.</li>
    <li> A nice lotion for men who don&#x27;t want to seem feminine.  Clean smell and my husband brings it with him when he travels.</li>
    <li> Love the product and its magic!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the only thing I&#x27;ll put on my face! A little goes a long way. The lotion spreads well, isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and smells good too!</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer that leaves your skin smooth and younger-looking. It also has a great smell. You can clearly tell that the company uses only the best ingredients. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this as it goes on lightly and works really well. Make sure to use &amp;#34;smaller than a dime&amp;#34; probably half a dime size for entire face &amp; lower neck</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best product out there for face moisturizing and sun protection combo.  I have bought and tried many products, and this one is by far the best.  It is expensive no doubt, but it really does work as advertised.  So if you don&#x27;t mind dropping the money down, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Was great for a couple days then my skin started breaking out horribly. Waited two weeks for it to clear up then tried again with same result.</li>
    <li> Awesome on my skin just awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this moisturizer works for some people but if you have acne prone combo face (don&#x27;t know if race matters) I recommend against this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a dry skin due to the cold weathers and was nursing a moderately acne prone skin (due to previous use of horrible products). First two days of applying the product (day and night) moistened my skin and made my face look healthier. By the end of the week, I started breaking out major acne/black heads on my forehead and small white acnes appeared random spots around the face/neck area. Also, I noticed that I moved away from having a semi-dry face to extremely oily face within span of two week. Unfortunately, I had to stop using the product and had to revert back to some left-over lotion that I had used in the past. Two days after I stopped using this product, I stopped breaking out as well and my face also became a little less oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give one star was that I am fully aware that the product works for some people. However, I do want to share my experience that it does cause complications for certain skin type (acne prone combo face).</li>
    <li> Bad ingredients, bad for the face. Made my skin worse.</li>
    <li> Great product but don&#x27;t buy from this seller. Container was not full. Smells good and absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  It is expensive but you aren&#x27;t getting what you paid for here. Buy from birchbox.</li>
    <li> Kyoku for Men Facial Moisturizer is a great product and a good replacement fot the product I was using.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a better moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and use it in combination with the Kyoku facial mask, exfoliating scrub, and daily face wash. It seems like a small bottle at only 1.7 oz, but it manages to last me 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer leaves my skin looking fresh and healthy. I love all of the Kyoku products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of cucumbers.  This contains cucumbers, albeit very faint.  Would love a different scent in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that:  works great!  Doesn&#x27;t feel glossy, and makes your face feel amazing!  The SPF is nice too.</li>
    <li> A bit too greasy for me.  I prefer the less greasy Zirh Correct or Zirh Protect.  This product was harder to smooth into your skin than Zirh Correct or Protect.  This product&#x27;s smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> First off, I thought I was nuts, and my girlfriend thought I was nuts when I decided to buy a moisturizer that costs $50 for 50ml. When I first squeezed it out onto my finger and smelled it, it reminded me of bamboos, and wind blowing in the grass, green tea, it smelled like something healthy that you can eat. I love the smell of it, it works amazing, my fine lines are reduced around my eyes and forehead area. In the morning it used to be hard to open my eyes because they feel so tired and dry, but every morning I wash my face, and apply with over a facial serum that I use and it keeps my face moist and nourished all day. I love this product and stand behind it, and I welcome any guy out there to give it a try.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works very well and as a bonus, it has a very light pleasant smell. (Review written by Bun&#x27;s husband)</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, but did not realize how little it actually was. Would order again if it was a larger amout for the same price.</li>
    <li> This works well, and a small amount goes a long way. I use it daily for a little more than 3 months and I&#x27;m still on the first bottle.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using now for a couple weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed that it adequately moisturizes without leaving a greasy feeling which is important when you&#x27;re wearing this all day. Definitely becomes helpful when you live in a climate where you have a lot of dry heat coming out of heaters during the winter.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as other moisturizers I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great cream, barely greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell bad or too much.&lt;br /&gt;The plus is the sunscreen going with it, so I always put some cream on on sunny days.</li>
    <li> great product and great price</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product from a great seller.</li>
    <li> No doubt about it, the price might be expensive, but it&#x27;s the best. No greesy feeling, great product and lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Moisturizes really well, absorbs quickly but has been leaving me feeling greasy at the end of the day.  My acne that has been under control for a while popped back up.</li>
    <li> Very good at what it&#x27;s suppose to do. However I have to give it three stars for its price/oz value. It is quite pricey (thirteen when I purchased)  and there are other comprobable products out there for a more affordable price.</li>
    <li> Everyone says sunscreen and mostureizing should be a daily habit. I have no problem with mostureizing, but sunscreen usually irritates my face if I wear it all day. This is best applied and washed off throughout the day to avoid irritation (if you&#x27;re like me, most people don&#x27;t have a problem with sunscreen like I do I think). Still looking for that magical combo that does both right. This is a step in the right direction, but is not yet perfection.</li>
    <li> Used this for months and it was a great moisturizer. Unfortunately it contains phenoxyethanol, which is a neuro- and reproductive toxin. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> A great moisturizer that really gives your skin a healthy look &amp; softer feel all day.  My face just absorbs it and holds it, with no shine or oily residue. Found it superior to Kiehls Facial fuel (although a notch below the all-natural Ursa Major face balm).  Problem is you&#x27;ll be lucky to get more than a two -week run out of this tube.  A larger quantity or lower price would make this a 5-star product, as you need a good amount to spread evenly over your face and neck.  Helpful hint:  After this tube gave out on me, I slashed it open with a knife, and had at least another 3-4 days worth on the inside.  OK, an extreme measure, but at this price...</li>
    <li> After a few days of use my facial dry skin has reduced considerably.  Will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This stuff rules.  Perfect face lotion and even has a little SPF in it.  The best part is that it&#x27;s not oily but it also moisturizes very well (I always had to trade one of those features for the other until I found this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it was a bigger tube, but 1 tube lasts me a solid 2 months, if not longer.  If you&#x27;re using CVS or grocery store lotion, stop it now and get something good.  You&#x27;ll wonder how you ever used anything else.</li>
    <li> Definitely met my expectations. I have previously been using Neutrogena for Men Age Fighter and have used triple protect in the past. This product is very light, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel at all. But moisturizes adequately. I haven;t been using it long enough to make any long term assessments but I am definitely satisfied after these few days. However, I am a little concerned that this $27 product will only last 3-4 weeks. I am trying to be conservative but we will see.</li>
    <li> Made me break out. Literally every time I use these products I get more bumps. I&#x27;m angry I was so gung ho and wrote good reviews for the other products from this line I bought. They are not good.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was a great addition to my morning and evening routine. This product absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy residue.</li>
    <li> Great for those with oily skin,  light and effective.  I use this after a shower in the morning last pretty much all day. Great product, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought plenty of moisturizer in a container this size, but for some reason this one just didn&#x27;t go far at all.  Aside from that, it was a good density, smelled pleasant, and did what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Clean face, happy face.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer for the price. I have used this moisturizer for a while (I am on my fourth tube), and it keeps my skin looking good. It is not oily and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasons for giving it a 4-star rating are size, price, and a lack of complementary product. The moisturizer performs better than some of the moisturizers that I have used in the past. Just before using this product, however, I used what I consider the best value moisturizer. This product performs similarly, but it is more expensive when compared on dollars per fluid ounce basis. The size of this moisturizer is a bit smaller than I prefer it to be. Because of that I find myself being a bit more cautious about how much I use at a time, and sometimes I find myself not applying enough on my face. Also, I am used to having a complement product to give extended UV protection. SPF15 will give you protection for about 3 hours and 45 minutes, but it is difficult to limit sun exposure to that time period after the application of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I am not willing to go back to the &amp;#34;best value&amp;#34; product because of the company&#x27;s values, and I have not been able to find a replacement product that stands out. I will probably use this product until I find a moisturizer that come in a size that is large enough to last reasonable time, is at a good price, and has complementary products to extend UV protection.</li>
    <li> When I came here to write this review, I was kind of surprised to see reviews from people not feeling moisturized, or in one case even, actually having a bad breakout(?) from Kyoku. This stuff seems to be all-natural, and from what I can tell, made from mostly edible elements (this is not an endorsement of this product being, in any way, a food item :p). If Kyoku causes a severe breakout or reaction, it would presumably mean the user has some form of allergy to one of the ingredients... But, enough speculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say with certainty is that for the past few years, I have been battling very dry and red skin on most of my face, especially my nose and cheekbones, as well as dry, irritated, and even bumpy skin around my hair/beard-line. It took a while before I sought out any moisturizers because I changed to all-natural soaps in the shower and mostly just stopped using soap on my face at all (washing only with cold water instead). It wasn&#x27;t until a year or so later that my skin had worsened to the point of being unbearably dry, flaky, and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried moisturizers for men from places like Walmart, and anything I could find always contained some sort of alcohol. These things claimed to be moisturizers, but the alcohol itself can be very drying (perhaps depending on skin type?), and those cheap moisturizers pretty much ruined my face while I was using them. I went to the friend of mine who is the most &amp;#34;fashion savvy&amp;#34; guy that I know, and asked for his advice on any kind of good, all-natural, non-alcohol face moisturizer for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He sent me here, to Amazon, and specifically, to Kyoku. In my opinion, it&#x27;s awesome stuff. It smells great, and makes my face feel like a million bucks. My skin is much smoother (no more acne around the hairline on my forehead!) and the horrible red skin on my cheekbones and around my nose has been reduced to a sort of healthy pink (and the flakes are gone). To be clear, the redness isn&#x27;t totally gone, but I suspect that may be because I have an underlying skin condition, and never actually expected Kyoku to cure it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first real &amp;#34;cosmetic product&amp;#34; and, as someone who doesn&#x27;t generally buy them, I can sympathize with those who say the product seems to be expensive for the amount you get. However, my friend pointed out that it would be $50 for the same tube at Macy&#x27;s, so, for $31 on Amazon? Yes, it&#x27;s worth it and I&#x27;m definitely going to buy another tube when this one runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, when I stop using Kyoku for a few days, my dry, red skin returns (hence the possible skin condition?), but I think that is pretty much to be expected. Kyoku probably isn&#x27;t going to be a lasting cure for anything, but if used at least once every other day, I&#x27;m certain most people would see much healthier skin.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s fantastic. It smells great and it works! Why then am I giving it 3 stars?? Well, personally, when I spend $30 on something I expect it to last more than a week. I only applied one time per day and I&#x27;m out already. The small container they give you is only 3/4 full. I suppose it&#x27;s my fault for not knowing how much 1.7 fluid ounces actually was, but I can&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars simply because they don&#x27;t make it in a larger size. I refuse to order 3 of these every month.</li>
    <li> Nothing much i can add beyond what has already been written except that you don&#x27;t need all that much each day to cover your face and neck effectively which will make the tube last longer. Oh and I guarantee you this is not a paid review....I have used the product for over a year now.</li>
    <li> My favorite facial moisturizer. Works like a charm. A little goes a long way. Lasts for a while, too. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price. Won&#x27;t cause you to break out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several men&#x27;s face moisturizers with sunscreen, and this is the best of the bunch (under $20). Neutrogena, Dove, and Cerave weren&#x27;t cutting it (though Cerave has a great night and all purpose lotion). This has a lemon scent, and take note of the size of the bottle. If you use it every day it will last you about a month.</li>
    <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy, not an overpowering scent to mask your aftershave or cologne, you really only need about a dime sized dollop.</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer with spf i have ever used. I tried Jack Black spf 45 and Neutrogena before but they causes mild acne breakout. I have been using this product for a month now and I love it. Very light, you can&#x27;t tell its presence but your skin look smooth and moist!!! Best of all, it has those natural ingredients that are healthy for your skin. A non-related comment: Not that I complain but I am wondering how Market Place sellers have the same product but 30+% cheaper than the original source?</li>
    <li> I really like Kyoku products and their scents in particular.  They are not greasy and work well.  The lava masque is great, the under eye cream is nice and their after shave balm and moisturizer also work well.</li>
    <li> If this stuff were cheaper, it&#x27;d be me go-to moisturizer. It&#x27;s great compared to other basic moisturizers I have used.</li>
    <li> This is the second time purchasing this product and I really like the way it goes on the skin, not greasy &amp; smelly(not in a bad way) like some others. Works well - Would recommend</li>
    <li> Absolutely nothing special. Stick with Kiel&#x27;s or La Ocitane&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me of the body lotion you get at hotels</li>
    <li> Very happy with this scrub. Typically priced with other higher end ones but works better than any I&#x27;ve used. Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent to it and leaves skin feeling amazing. An excellent option.</li>
    <li> FYI, my face is a little sensitive to alcohol but I still use after shave balm and cologne anyway. This stuff was like I rubbed poison ivy on my face. It  swelled up and looked like a Botox job when bad. Took three days to go away, then face looked bad for a few more days. Went back to Nivea For Men Sensitive Face Lotion. If you buy it try a small spot first if you are at all concerned.</li>
    <li> It seems like a small amount and it probably is, but you don&#x27;t need use much for it to last. A little more expensive than other moisturizers, which can be a turn off for some. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 weeks or so, just about to finally run out. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I would buy again if it was a bit more inexpensive. I have used other moisturizers, this one is better than some I&#x27;ve tried, but not the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find something that works&lt;br /&gt;This works. For daily use and biking and snowboarding.&lt;br /&gt;Includes SPF 25 which is great for fair skinned people</li>
    <li> The plastic bottle of 1,7 fluid ounce contain just a small quantity of moisturizer... In addition it doesnt moisturize my skin the same way that i use the previous moisturizer.</li>
    <li> first time trying this brand and it does a good job. my face been experiencing dryness since i was in college. .nothing can solve it. I tried many brands but not work great.. this one does it job and keep my face moisturize throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I had an allergy had to give away I got a 100% money back refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kyoku products for several months now (face wash, scrub, and lotion).  I&#x27;ve had horrible skin since 13 (I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s now) and tried it all:  Proactive, Accutane, SkinID, dermatologist prescribed creams, and off the shelf products.  Since implementing Kyoku products into my daily routine a few months ago my skin has improved tenfold.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine using anything else now.  Daily I use: Kyoku Facial Cleanser &gt; Anthony Logistics Toner Pads &gt; Kyoku Face Lotion.  Once a week I&#x27;ll use the Kyoku Face Scrub directly after the Kyoku Facial Cleanser and Menscience Face Mask (I&#x27;ll try the Kyoku Lava Masque once this runs out).</li>
    <li> This product works well--I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that this is the best thing on the planet for oily skin. Upon first applying it, thee is definitely a nice matte look to your face instead of instant-grease-ball. However, it doesn&#x27;t last for more than half a day or less.</li>
    <li> I would replace it with vaseline.......</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works great, I use it on my face in conjunction with the Kyoku eye radiance cream and my face looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> Not oily and leaves my skin fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> My son loves this product.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this works the best of any cheap or expensive lotions. Not greasy and keeps skin soft</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has very dry skin during the winter.  I looked into the best men&#x27;s lotions and this along with Kiehl&#x27;s consistently made the top ten.  When it went on sale, I snatched it up and we both are very happy with it.  A little bit goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly.  I could see how some reviewers call it greasy if they were using too much.  It is thick and you only need a fingertip&#x27;s amount to do your whole face.  It is natural smelling, not musky like a lot of men&#x27;s products, so after running out of my moisturizer one night I tried it too and I liked it very much.</li>
    <li> Smooth, fresh feeling skin ever since I started using this!</li>
</ol>
