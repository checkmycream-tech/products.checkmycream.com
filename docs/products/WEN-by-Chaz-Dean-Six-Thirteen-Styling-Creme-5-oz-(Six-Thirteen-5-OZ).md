      <li>I love this WEN styling cream.</li>
      <li>that I like, I believe this product will work better for me.</li>
      <li>I also note my hair appears thinner when in better condition.</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>Love it, it helps protect my hair.  </li>
      <li>All I can say is I&amp;#34;m glad that someone stopped me----WEN</li>
      <li>and now I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>this is her favorite in the Wen line</li>
      <li>I love the smell..</li>
      <li>Love all wen products</li>
      <li>What more can you say about 613?</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Wen has made a HUGE difference in my hair and I am so glad to be able to get such a great deal on Wen products on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a horrible odor by any means, just strong.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to be able to reduce and streamline my hair products.</li>
      <li>Going to Chaz Dean&#x27;s website, I would easily pay $36 for ONE 5 oz bottle.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair so manageable &amp; easy to brush through.</li>
      <li>The Wen cleansing conditioner along with this styling cream have replaced a multitude of products and my curly/wavy hair feels healthy and is full of volume.</li>
      <li>kept me from making a HUGE mistake with my hair.  </li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of Wen.</li>
      <li>It is ALWAYS shiny and smooth and silky to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair smooth and tangle free.</li>
      <li>Fantastic stuff.  </li>
      <li>I have short hair with some curl, and this works great.  </li>
      <li>I have not given this product  5 stars because I am still experimenting with it, although I have been pretty happy so far.  </li>
      <li>sure enough I become very satisfied the softness and manageable</li>
      <li>Sometimes I think it is too rich</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful, not sticky, doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard.</li>
      <li>Wow Wen products are amazing.</li>
      <li>This product is really helping my ends stay healthy.  </li>
      <li>My hair is completely straight on the top portion and curly/wavy/frizzy underneath.  </li>
      <li>If this was an authentic Wen product, it was very old.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
      <li>so I assume it is as good as the other products she uses.</li>
      <li>I have to find the right combination of products.  </li>
      <li>I think this is because fall out happens naturally and with Wen it detangles to the point where hair that would fall out glides out during the wash and is more readily noticeably.</li>
      <li>it make my face very soft smooth</li>
      <li>They do exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I only cut it once every 24 months to donate to Locks of Love.  </li>
      <li>I agree with others who said it has a funny smell to it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other styling cremes by WEN and thought they were spectacular...</li>
      <li>If you really want to see a difference, go for the six thirteen line first.</li>
      <li>I often don&#x27;t wear perfume after putting this in my hair because it clashes, having such a strong odor.  </li>
      <li>I certainly hope this is the case anyway.</li>
      <li>It was rancid and the smell was pure chemical.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair super soft and it is so much easier to just use one product.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
      <li>but it absolutely did not.  </li>
      <li>My hair is much softer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Left hair dry and unmanageable</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like that dried out my hair, did moisturized but realize not the original product</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister who loves Wen, she hasn&#x27;t said anything bad so I assume it is as good as the other products she uses. this is her favorite in the Wen line</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Wen. I got this as a gift for my best friend and she loves it. The smell is amazing too!</li>
    <li> its ok don&#x27;t believe the hype</li>
    <li> Great product! I had brought this item after learning how terrific this hair product is and how your hair would feel very soft and nourish. So, I thought to give it a try and sure enough I become very satisfied the softness and manageable my hair feels. I&#x27;m very happy that I&#x27;ve found this product!</li>
    <li> Lasted a long time....worth the money.</li>
    <li> Only a small amount is needed for all of my hair which is a switch.</li>
    <li> It works well for my hair and I do like it.  I agree with others who said it has a funny smell to it.  I do not notice the smell once it is in my hair and my hair dries.  It really enhances my natural spiral curls.  The only negative for me is the smell at first.</li>
    <li> I have bought Six Thirteen products before but never have I come across such a stink...don&#x27;t know if the product is old</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get the blowout without using a styling creme; not sure about 613 in my hair.  Sometimes I think it is too rich so I use lavender styling creme as  switch off.</li>
    <li> A great product for my hair.  My hair is curly and thick.  Six Thirteen helps style it nicely.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  I have short hair with some curl, and this works great.  I put it on towel dried hair and work it through.  I let it dry naturally - fluffing it up as it dries.  I do not comb it once I have put it in, but use my fingers to style.  I sometimes add more later or the next day with some water on my hands to fluff it some more.  I also use it with a dryer sometimes when I want my hair fuller.  Not sticky - does not weigh hair down - just keep fluffing.</li>
    <li> fabulous buy, great transaction</li>
    <li> I like this creme for my hair.  My hair is long medium texture, wavy, somewhat curly.  It helps keep frizz flyaways at bay.  A little is all you need or it will be to heavy.  The scent on this one took a little getting used to.  I would buy again but only if the price was comparable to this purchase.  As a rule Wen products are usually way over priced.</li>
    <li> Works great! Great price</li>
    <li> Brings out the curls!</li>
    <li> I have to continue using this product to give a better opinion.  So far it seems to dry my hair out a little.  I have to find the right combination of products.  Now that I purchased castor oil that I like, I believe this product will work better for me.</li>
    <li> I have been a Wen girl for over a year now and will not use ANYTHING that isn&#x27;t Wen in or on my hair.  Wen has made a HUGE difference in my hair and I am so glad to be able to get such a great deal on Wen products on Amazon!  I love the Six Thirteen line and LOVE this styling creme!  It came very quickly and nicely packaged- no leaks or problems.  I would highly recommend this seller and will use them again in the future!</li>
    <li> Finally a hair product that gives what it promises ! My hair is soft, keeps its curl, much less likely to frizz. I will continue to use this product. I have sent some to others to try.</li>
    <li> I love the smell..but on my ethnic hair it makes it hard</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other styling cremes by WEN and thought they were spectacular...but this tops them, hands down.  I have baby-fine hair so was worried that the extra conditioning/protection would weigh down my hair but it absolutely did not.  I&#x27;m sold.  I will stick to this styling creme from now on.</li>
    <li> Good body for my baby fine hair</li>
    <li> Tried this product after I washed my hair with the Wen Shampoo, and this leave in conditioner instantly took out all of the knots in my wet hair, and made my hair soft, and easily manageable.  I was able to comb through and style my hair with little effort.  Loved this product...will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;[hair type&#x3D;Afro-American/permed]&lt;br /&gt;[hair length&#x3D;short]&lt;br /&gt;[condition of hair&#x3D;chemically damaged, weak, and breaking off]</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!!!!!!,!!!!!,,,,,,,,,</li>
    <li> Great product by Wen!</li>
    <li> I have not given this product  5 stars because I am still experimenting with it, although I have been pretty happy so far.  I&#x27;m excited to be able to reduce and streamline my hair products. The Wen cleansing conditioner along with this styling cream have replaced a multitude of products and my curly/wavy hair feels healthy and is full of volume. I may have found my holy grail!</li>
    <li> great product for volume</li>
    <li> Love this. Just ordered more!</li>
    <li> Love this product and thankful Amazon has the best price for it!!</li>
    <li> This replaced every product I had in the cabinet.  Nothing comes close! Perfect consistency, gets rid of my frizzies and flyaways, brings out my waves and curls. My hair feels great too, no stickyness or stiffness.  My only complaint is how strong it smells.  I often don&#x27;t wear perfume after putting this in my hair because it clashes, having such a strong odor.  It&#x27;s not a horrible odor by any means, just strong.</li>
    <li> Good hold great smell! Keeps friz down. I use a squirt of the gell and work into my wet towel dried hair after washing. Twist hair up into a clip and sleep on it. Next day run fingers thru largeoose curls and go.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair super soft and it is so much easier to just use one product.</li>
    <li> What more can you say about 613? It is a miracle styling cream. Smells wonderful, not sticky, doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard. Wonderful product</li>
    <li> Knock off not authentic. I compared it to my QVC and bottle and its totally different!!! I returned</li>
    <li> Great value does wonders on my hair</li>
    <li> I use a lot of WEN products, but normally order from WEN. I believe this product has been on the shelve too long. Smells horribly and would not put in my hair because of the smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a year.  My hair is completely straight on the top portion and curly/wavy/frizzy underneath.  This product is a life saver.  It takes 95% of the frizz out.  I will always keep stocked up on this product.</li>
    <li> the product is not something I&#x27;d buy again....didn&#x27;t do what it said it would....</li>
    <li> WEN products are the only hair products I have used for cleansing my thick, frizzy &amp;#34;senior citizen&amp;#34;hair for over 3 yrs. They do exactly as advertised. I alternate this with the fig cleansing cream for dry, color treated hair and it keeps my hair hydrated and soft. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this WEN styling cream. It makes my hair so manageable &amp; easy to brush through. It has a very nice fragrance also.</li>
    <li> Moisturized my hair and kept the curls styled and defined, very soft to the touch no stiffness.</li>
    <li> Can see the difference it makes</li>
    <li> Six Thirteen is the best.  Love the scent!  And love Wen!</li>
    <li> Wow Wen products are amazing. My hair is much softer.</li>
    <li> This product is really helping my ends stay healthy.  My hair is growing nicely now, since it doesn&#x27;t break anymore.  I like Wen products.</li>
    <li> I use it as a leave in conditioner. Keeps my hair smooth and tangle free. Great scent. I combine with CHS Curl Keeper or a gel.</li>
    <li> So far, I like it.  Not as heavy as other Wen styling products.  Nice fragrance as well.  (Lemon-y?)</li>
    <li> Smell great I have been using on my face and I love it it make my face very soft smooth my make up goes on everly with out a greasy feel</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days and my hair feels so soft, I LOVE it!!!!</li>
    <li> Well priced and I would definitely order it again. Happy Customer.</li>
    <li> this shampoo smells awful</li>
    <li> If this was an authentic Wen product, it was very old.  It was rancid and the smell was pure chemical.  I normally buy from QVC on this product and had one on hand to compare the smell to.  Horrible!  The price lured me in but it was &amp;#34;too good to be true.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff! Wen rocks!</li>
    <li> I love this formula but not for everyday use. I it smells amazing and leaves our hair silky &amp; manageable but I choose to switch out to my regular Wen for daily use (just my preference I guess)</li>
    <li> All I can say is for this discounted price- it&#x27;s worth a try.  I think it makes a difference, but I don&#x27;t know--maybe someone else with another hair type may not.  With winter coming, this is a good time of year to try it.  Anyways, as you get older - I wish someone would have told  me this a LONG time ago-as you get older, I feel your hair changes a bit--even though I know Chaz on his infomercial may say it&#x27;s not your hair, it&#x27;s what your doing to it---anyways, back when I was younger-it seemed everyone was getting perms---to make a long story short--I never did and now I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t.  Well, I came really close last year to thinking of a perm--I know crazy--winter blues, who knows what? well, what happened was I used a shampoo---and it was such a mess--I had to chop some it off because the knots where just unbearable so I felt I either needed a perm (like I said, crazy) or I needed to do something else--because my hair never used to knot up like this (even with regular conditioner)  and I saw this infomercial for WEN and it stopped me.  All I can say is I&amp;#34;m glad that someone stopped me----WEN kept me from making a HUGE mistake with my hair.  Now, I don&#x27;t use it everyday-I use a plain clarifying shampoo and alternate with WEN--but WEN has kept my hair in a new amazing balance---and I know if I go so long without the oils, or cleansing conditioner--YES&amp;#60;my hair actually seems to have a fit. and the knottedness starts to return.  SIX THIRTEEN is the bomb. If you really want to see a difference, go for the six thirteen line first.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product!!!!</li>
    <li> Had a bad smell so threw it away.</li>
    <li> I had a Brazilian done to my hair. Using Wen styling creme only enhances the shine. No dullness just shine. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen products on my hair for about 6 years.  I am Asian, and I keep my hair long.  I only cut it once every 24 months to donate to Locks of Love.  I live in Louisiana and I shower (and wash my hair) at least twice everyday, 3 times in the hot summer months.  I do not blow dry my hair; I let it air dry.  I use Wen Cleansing conditioner every time I wash my hair.  I use the styling creme on dripping wet hair and let it air dry.  My hair is NEVER frizzy in the Louisiana humid weather.  It is ALWAYS shiny and smooth and silky to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this Styling Creme on my toes and nails after every pedicure and manicure.  It works great!&lt;br /&gt;The price on amazon.com is unbelievable!  Going to Chaz Dean&#x27;s website, I would easily pay $36 for ONE 5 oz bottle.  QVC sells them for $32 for ONE 5 oz bottle.  At under $10, this is a steal.  AND THIS IS THE SAME STUFF I GOT FROM QVC.  I COMPARED THE BOTTLES SIDE BY SIDE, AND READ OFF THE WORDS, WORD FOR WORD.  IT IS THE SAME BOTTLE.</li>
    <li> works great.  I also use the Wen shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it works wonderful</li>
    <li> Love it, it helps protect my hair.  Feels and smells great.  Price is great considering other places and the small bottle lasts longer than I would expect, I use 1 pump daily on my med length naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> Makes hair really soft and shiny, but I have trouble keeping a curl!</li>
    <li> Love all wen products</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff.  Always use after Wen cleansing treatment.  Hair color has never lasted so long nor has my hair felt so soft.</li>
    <li> Great for my gray hair</li>
    <li> It works, but only gets three stars because I do not like the smell.  It smells like a cleaning product.</li>
    <li> Gives your hair a wonderful feeling</li>
    <li> A good price for Wen&#x27;s styling creme. I do not like the scent of 6/13 as well as the other scents, however it is more moisturizing. I also feel the consistency is thicker. This was a good price, so I grabbed it. Provided the price doesn&#x27;t increase, I might repeat this purchase. I did remove a star because the product had some spillage in transport. Although in a plastic bag, a small amount did end up in the bag. I feel it was likely due to heat, since the product was unopened. I only use Wen. If you are not familiar with Wen, it is a product that seems to renew one&#x27;s hair. The cleansing products are the only products that do not dry out my hair as for my continued use. Some customers do complain of fall out. I think this is because fall out happens naturally and with Wen it detangles to the point where hair that would fall out glides out during the wash and is more readily noticeably. I certainly hope this is the case anyway. I also note my hair appears thinner when in better condition. The styling cremes and leave-ins are superb and no hair loss has ever been suggested except for the cleansing conditioners. I hope this review is helpful.</li>
    <li> This too, is pricey for the amount; however, you use much less of it than the cleanser. Not sure if I will continue to use it; I have not decided if it makes enough of a difference compared to my former leave in conditioner.</li>
