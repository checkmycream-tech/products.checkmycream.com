<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Expensive, but it will prevent and help rid of male Candida occurrence.</li>
    <li> The best soap ever. My kids and I have eczema and this doesn&#x27;t cause flare ups.</li>
    <li> This soap is great. I use it as a daily bar soap in the shower. The ingredients are wonderful, and I am very strict about ingredients and knowing what I am putting on/in my body. I use ewg.org/skindeep as a reference to look up all products and ingredients that I use (hair, makeup, sunscreen, chapstick, soap, toner, make-up remover....everything) and this soap is acceptable for my high standards of product chemistry. The smell is wonderful and lemony, it cleanses easily and well and comes off quickly. I originally bought it to try as a face soap because of the tea tree oil but it dried my face out so I switched to using it on my body (it helps with backne/back acne) and is not too drying there. For my face I use Nubian Heritage&#x27;s African black soap which is also great in terms of its ingredients and has kept my face very clear (I have combination skin and mild acne before using this, now my skin is much better). The african black soap and lemongrass soap are about $3-4 a bar at Vitamin Shoppe, so cheaper in bulk here on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Bar-Soap-African-Blk-Pack/dp/B001E0VBDK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1428767518&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;nubian+heritage+african+black+soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body lotion I use is great ingredient-wise (no sls, parabens, fragrance/parfum, bht, etc.) and is very effective in the northeast winter and will help if this soap dries you out:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Shea-Moisture-Butter-Healing-Lotion/dp/B005C2NAO4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1428767614&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;shea+moisture+baby+lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it as a daily face soap and find it too drying, I recommend the NH African black soap with this face lotion (does not cause me to break out: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027UQDB6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_9) and this toner (http://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Alcohol-Free-Witch-Formula-Unscented/dp/B001DJDP7C/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1428767910&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;thayer%27s+witch+hazel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, I highly recommend researching all ingredients of every product you use, you would be surprised at what chemicals are allowed in products.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful all-natural soap for everyday use. It leaves your skin feeling and smelling great. We received our shipment quickly and in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Soap smells wonderfully fresh, lathers extremely well, and is long lasting</li>
    <li> Great smell and the little beads are just abrasive enough not to irritate skin</li>
    <li> Love this fragrant soap.  It gives me a clean and fresh feel without being drying or irritating.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent and great feel of skin after use</li>
    <li> Great for acne and oily skin. Have used it for a few years .</li>
    <li> Skin brightening, rinses clean. Use it for my face and body. The smell is awesome. Great priduct for a good price.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant soap.  Nice smell and rinses off clean.  I will only use this brand and Dr Bonner&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This soap lathers up well and rinses off nicely, leaving skin feeling fresh and clean. Love the citrus smell and the large sized bar is a nice weight to shower with.  With two people using it on a daily basis, it will last at lease a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> love the quality &amp; scent and my skin loves the feel of the blend..Nubian is the best!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap and I feel so clean.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your business and time .the  soap  smells  very good  love  it. I will buy again thank you</li>
    <li> My skin gets dry when I used cheap bar soaps in the shower, but that is not a problem with this product.  It smells great, has a nice lather, and lasts long time.  A rare 5-star rating from me.</li>
    <li> Great for face and body.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with Nubian Heritage and it has left quite an impression on me. The aroma comes off as a blend of citrus and ginger. The soap is refreshing and works well with my oily, acne-prone skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this soap! As my husband says &amp;#34;it makes you feel squeaky clean&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Well bought this soap on a wim ,usually by the black soap .This soap is very fragrant and soaps well and has a sort of courseness to it and lasts very long.I am apparently addicted to it because now I have to take it to my shore house because I had a different soap in the shower and didn&#x27;t feel clean after.Go figure ! So give it a try especially if you suffer from slight skin dryness as I do ,and importantly no itching after a shower .!,,</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  About the only thing I&#x27;m not super fond of are the little flecks of exfoliating seeds (orange peel?).  Not a big deal but I could do without them.  Other than that, I love this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for acne prone skin due to the tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Awesome lemongrass scent but not overpowering. Does not dry the skin. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love , love,  just love this soap !! Giving them out to everyone in my family !!</li>
    <li> Awesome smell, have only used once so I&#x27;m not sure about how effective it is but my skin was not dry when I used it!</li>
    <li> This soap is heavenly.  It lathers profusely. The scent is wonderful. It leaves my skin smooth and soft. Having spent a long harsh winter indoors, my skin had become itchy from the dry heat.  After trying many lotions and oils nothing relieved this until I used this soap. I highly recommend this soap. I gave a bar to my son and he absolutely loved it.</li>
    <li> Seems to do the job. Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin. Has a nice scent and looks to last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love love love the smell! It&#x27;s so clean and earthy smelling! The good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t overpower whatever fragrance you&#x27;d like to wear for the day like other soaps do. It leaves my skin fresh, clean, and glowing. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see what it will do to my blemishes, but hopefully I can update soon!</li>
    <li> Long lasting.  Some other tea tree soaps have dissipated fast.  This is my shower bar.  There are little specks of ingredients in the bar as it is used that add a little exfoliation.  Although it is not on the ingredient list the bar smells like Lemon Verbena.  Not bad just super lemon.  You wont smell like lemon pine sol or anything, just quite zesty.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Scents are not too overpowering....just right.</li>
    <li> Refreshing and long lasting.</li>
    <li> The transaction was a smooth one, they were delivered on time. It made my skin feel great after showering.  I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This soap has helped e with my face acne marks tremendously! Within days of using this soap, my face was brighter and my dark spots started to fade! Highly recommend this soap if u are suffering with acne marks!</li>
    <li> Rinses clean. Smells fantastic! I use it daily, even on my face.</li>
    <li> I replaced my antibacterial bar soap with this and it is a fabulous product!</li>
    <li> Kind to skin, good anti-fungal, and smells citrusy and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Great for my eczema and it has made my skin incredibly soft. The bar is long lasting too as I use it in the shower and if it were regular soap it wold be a sliver of it&#x27;s former glory. But it is still rather large. The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming after you dry off and I have had no problems lotion-ing as normal and not smelling of lemons. It was also delivered quickly. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll wash with another soap again.</li>
    <li> One of the best soap choices I&#x27;ve made to date. So far so good. And that great lemon smell leaves you looking forward to your next soaking.</li>
    <li> Nice soap.  Leaves a bit of a film, compared to the Pre de Provence brand.  It&#x27;s cheap, though.  Also, I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my skin from the tea tree element.  It seems to have an exfoliant in the soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband since he had a bad case of athletes foot and it seems that Tea Tree is a safe and effective way of treating it.  It has a very pleasant scent.  Great in the shower and better than any deodorant soap you buy from the store.  Natural, safe and that refreshing Lemongrass smell is awesome.  By the way my husbands athletes foot cleared up.</li>
    <li> The title says it all.</li>
    <li> This soap works well with  my skin. My skin is so smooth  and clear. I would  recommend  this product  because  it works well in improving skin appearance  and as an antiseptic. It is natural and it doesn&#x27;t kill the good  bacteria  on your skin.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it - I stopped using all these facial washes, etc. I feel that this product targets all of my skin issues, especially my occassional breakouts.</li>
    <li> I work in healthcare, so I wash my hands compulsively even when I&#x27;m not at work. Dial soap has its place, but it dries my hands like crazy, so I switched to bar soaps for when I don&#x27;t need full death-and-destruction disinfection, to alleviate the dry red patches on the backs of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these bars. Tea tree is supposedly antibacterial, along with some of the other citrus components listed in the ingredients. The scent is a nice, naturally light lemon, and I LOVE the scrubby specks embedded in the bar. They clean off my hands without desiccating them--and I *feel* clean. Plus, it doubles as a facial cleanser, especially good for oily skin (I use this in rotation with 5 other Nubian Heritage soaps; haven&#x27;t seen dramatic improvements in my mild acne vs. other soap brands though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this pack for ~$15, and I don&#x27;t think $3/bar is astronomically high for a soap that&#x27;s predominantly shea, coconut, and cocoa butter, and produced by a small company.</li>
    <li> I think saying this my favorite soap does not quite capture the magnitude of my love for this stuff.  Let me tell you, this little bar of wonderful is the best thing to smell in the morning and is about as refreshing and natural as a squeeze of citrus life nectar.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, have been using it for a while now. Smells good and is healthy for your skin, Will continue to buy, also makes a great gift item</li>
    <li> Soft and moist (like Shea butter). Smell is very nice. I have very dry hands skin, so I recognize a good soap fast, since I see after a few minutes how my skin reacts. I&#x27;m happy to confirm that this one is not drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is big (141gr) so maybe that&#x27;s the reason for the relatively high price.. Aprox. 3.7$ per one unit isn&#x27;t cheap. So I deduct one star since I think the price is a little on the extreme side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I won&#x27;t stop buying as long they sell those.. Naturally antibacterial is a big plus</li>
    <li> Great Tea Tree bar soap. It was pretty hard to find this type of soap in spite of how popular tea tree oil seems to have become recently. This soap has a nice sent, but is not overpowering. It seems to last a bit longer than typical bar soap does, and has a little bit of texture added to it. The soap does not dry out my skin as much as other brands have, so far. I have normal to slightly dry skin. For more sensitive skin types this might be an issue but I would think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> This product works fantastic I first tried it in the summer for a heat rash and it worked wonderfully,This is my second order and would recommend this product too anyone and have</li>
    <li> Soap is scratchy and irritating to the skin. It&#x27;s because of the orange peel in it. I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Cleans but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.  Took care of my adult acne.  Delivered quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Gentle soap with a great aroma!</li>
    <li> I have OILY skin (on my face), and it gets even worse in the summer months, especially with the humidity where I live.  I use this soap year round.  My skin has never reacted harshly to it.  Matter of fact since using it, my skin seems to be more clear, and even when I do get an occasional pimple, I don&#x27;t get horrible ones and the marks that are left behind don&#x27;t stay there long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best facial cleanser ever in my opinion.  Remember to use moisturizer and sunscreen year round!!!</li>
    <li> I love this soap to keep my female parts fresh.  It lasts a long time for what I use it.</li>
    <li> this soap is amazing! smells great and leaves the skin smooth and moisturized.  has small exfoliating beads which was a nice surprise!  I can already see my skin clearing up and becoming smoother.</li>
    <li> Made my breakouts on my face go away, no other soap has been able to despite what they say. It smells great and I can actually feel how clean my skin is. This with coconut oil is a dream. I plan to buy nothing else.</li>
    <li> The best soap featuring lemon and teagrass. I feel fresh and invigorated after my showers.</li>
    <li> Bought this &amp;  Africa Verbena Sea Butter Bar Soap at same time.  I used this soap for about 3 days and then tried the Africa Verbena Sea Butter Soap and I prefer the later, much more creamy .</li>
    <li> It leaves skin feeling clean but the smell is something close to lemon pledge or lemon pine sol . I rather not smell like cleaning liquid. In terms of my complexion.... I have not seen a difference.</li>
    <li> I loveee these soaps. all natural and smells amazing. there are also so many varieties!</li>
    <li> Makes your skin just glow WOW!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to regular soap again!  Love the light fresh clean scent and that I feel so clean after using this soap!</li>
    <li> The soap has a wonderful clean scent, the orange peels feel great and it lasts a really long time! Does not dry out my skin and it leaves a nice feeling on my skin. Thank you for such a great product! Ordering more!</li>
    <li> Ok, I expected more scent but there is little to no scent.</li>
    <li> Smells great, exfoliates, and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a nice quality soap, with a mild scent and good &#x27;latherability&#x27;.  I would prefer a little more scent, but it is pleasant and the soap is not drying.  I&#x27;m not sure about the value, which is why I only gave 4 stars, but it is obviously a fine quality soap.</li>
    <li> Great non-drying bath soap.  Love the scent</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this soap! Smells amazing and has cleared all the small bumps on my skin!</li>
    <li> Smells great, rinses clean. Leaves lasting moisturizing on skin</li>
    <li> Will be reordering again soon.... You&#x27;ve got a customer for life.  This soap cleans perfectly, and smells divine... Lemongrass is my favorite.</li>
