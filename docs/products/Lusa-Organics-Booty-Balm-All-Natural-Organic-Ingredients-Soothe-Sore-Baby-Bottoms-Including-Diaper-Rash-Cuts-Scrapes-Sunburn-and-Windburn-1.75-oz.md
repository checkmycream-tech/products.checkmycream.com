      <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>Love this balm!</li>
      <li>Love the smell and my husband has used it on his burns already!</li>
      <li>This product is cloth diaper safe and works great on any irritation or abrasion plus the product has an acceptable smell to it unlike many diaper products.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and works really well with cloth diapers or disposables.</li>
      <li>Plus, it smells nice - lavender instead of chemicals.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that it can be used with my cloth diapers (which is why I bought it)</li>
      <li>I can confirm that this product is in fact cloth diaper safe.</li>
      <li>I have tried many over the counter creams and could never find anything that worked well until this product.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve tried many - in both cloth and disposable diapers.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite diaper rash cream.</li>
      <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>Excellent product especially for cloth diapering.</li>
      <li>I am happy to have found a natural product that WORKS and can be used with CDs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on his diapers.</li>
      <li>Thanks Lusa!!! :-)</li>
      <li>So good, the wife wants me to rub it on her pregnant belly instead of babys bits!</li>
      <li>may* not be the best for treatment if other reviewers&#x27; concerns are correct.</li>
      <li>We are still waiting for the little guy to get here, but I am so excited to have him smell so delicious!</li>
      <li>I also received the massage oil which was wonderful to rub his little gassy tummy!</li>
      <li>I originally came across this product when looking for something that would work for diaper rash WITH cloth diapers.</li>
      <li>My daughter has been suffering from diaper rash but the booty balm has significantly reduced her discomfort.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very portable and applies very smoothly.</li>
      <li>slightly red bottom tuned BRIGHT</li>
      <li>It is also organic, gluten-free, local to me, and family owned (by a good family).  </li>
      <li>;  It&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>But it could not stand up to treating our baby&#x27;s full force diaper rash.</li>
      <li>I honestly could not attest as to whether or not this product treats existing diaper rashes because at two months old, our son has yet to get one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soothing and clears up rashes quickly.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s cleared it up fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>but with my first son I couldn&#x27;t keep his bottom rash free for even a week.</li>
      <li>And the chap chin balm- makes his face so soft plus a light clean scent everyone comments on!</li>
      <li>He healed pretty quickly and has never got burns or rashes ever since.</li>
      <li>However, when he first had the rash it was pretty stubborn and we had to use desitin to treat it as this balm wasn&#x27;t effective enough.   </li>
      <li>This product smells great and is very helpful at preventing our little man from getting diaper rash.  </li>
      <li>I started using this product when I was cloth diapering my second baby because Booty Balm is cloth diaper safe.  </li>
      <li>Also, make sure you&#x27;re a fan of patchuoli scents, because it definitely stands out.</li>
      <li>As first time parents, my BF and I forgot to start applying any sort of lotion/balm every time we changed out baby&#x27;s diapers.</li>
      <li>The consistency of this cream is nice - it spreads smoothly and easily across our baby&#x27;s skin, in addition to not being difficult to remove from our hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you use it only when the baby&#x27;s bottom is just barely starting to look pink, as more of a preventative measure, it does a good job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper, and there are various (trial) sizes available.</li>
      <li>I know I sound like it is a big achievement</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the scent at all, but it really bothered my husband who is not a fan of patchuoli</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe useful to older children or as a hand salve, but I won&#x27;t be using this near any sensitive areas on anyone.</li>
      <li>Classic new mom error.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I have to for this one.</li>
      <li>Her cheeks were soft within 24 hours of using it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so natural, you could use it anywhere!</li>
      <li>This should NOT be used on baby&#x27;s sensitive areas.</li>
      <li>He is now 6 weeks old and his bottom is (touch wood) rash-free.</li>
      <li>Usually by the next time he&#x27;s ready for a new diaper, the mild irritation is gone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The fact that this product is completely natural makes it worth the slight inconvenience that it</li>
      <li>I would rather be able to use an organic product 99% of the time and only have to resort to something else a few times if a condition escalates to something it can&#x27;t handle instead of settling for something lesser just for the sake of consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s all back to normal.</li>
      <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
      <li>My three year old recently said that Booty Balm &amp;#34;makes</li>
      <li>I know all babies are different, and I think my baby might have particularly sensitive skin, but I used this twice and both times her</li>
      <li>I tried several different organic and natural balms/lotions/etc for my baby&#x27;s chapped face.</li>

    <li> My daughter has been suffering from diaper rash but the booty balm has significantly reduced her discomfort. I have tried many over the counter creams and could never find anything that worked well until this product. We use cloth diapers so the balm does not stick or leak through the cloth. Very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Helps a lot with diaper rash prevention and healing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product especially for cloth diapering. I have been using it on my second baby from day 1. He is now 6 weeks old and his bottom is (touch wood) rash-free. I know I sound like it is a big achievement but with my first son I couldn&#x27;t keep his bottom rash free for even a week. I am happy to have found a natural product that WORKS and can be used with CDs. Keep up the good work Rachel!</li>
    <li> This product smells great and is very helpful at preventing our little man from getting diaper rash.  He has sensitive skin and we use this balm to prevent him from getting an irritating rash.  However, when he first had the rash it was pretty stubborn and we had to use desitin to treat it as this balm wasn&#x27;t effective enough.   I can confirm that this product is in fact cloth diaper safe.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I use it on cloth diapers and my baby&#x27;s bottom loves it even more, it smells great as well.</li>
    <li> I originally came across this product when looking for something that would work for diaper rash WITH cloth diapers. This had come recommended to me by a friend. If you use it only when the baby&#x27;s bottom is just barely starting to look pink, as more of a preventative measure, it does a good job. But it could not stand up to treating our baby&#x27;s full force diaper rash. We had to temporarily switch to something more powerful when our little one had a really nasty diaper rash, because this one wasn&#x27;t cutting it. Also, make sure you&#x27;re a fan of patchuoli scents, because it definitely stands out. I didn&#x27;t mind the scent at all, but it really bothered my husband who is not a fan of patchuoli</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have tried!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and my husband has used it on his burns already! We are still waiting for the little guy to get here, but I am so excited to have him smell so delicious!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I have to for this one. We use cloth diapers, and have two different types of rash ointment: Booty Balm and a Grovia Stick. The two times he&#x27;s had a really bad rash - including this weekend, where it suddenly was horribly painful and all over - we slathered him with Booty Balm. It comforted him instantaneously, and the rash disappeared within 12 hours. LOVE this stuff. Grovia did not work at all. Plus, it smells nice - lavender instead of chemicals.</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I was cloth diapering my second baby because Booty Balm is cloth diaper safe.  It is also organic, gluten-free, local to me, and family owned (by a good family).  Although my kids are out of diapers now we still keep Booty Balm around the house for cuts and scrapes.  My three year old recently said that Booty Balm &amp;#34;makes everything better.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s true.</li>
    <li> I know all babies are different, and I think my baby might have particularly sensitive skin, but I used this twice and both times her slightly red bottom tuned BRIGHT red- the BootyBalm made it worse!! The stuff smells divine, but that&#x27;s about it. Plus it is REALLY expensive! It&#x27;s nice that it can be used with my cloth diapers (which is why I bought it) but I will have to stick with my disposable diapers and Desitin when we get diaper rash from now on.</li>
    <li> I hate to give a Lüsa product a bad review, but I need to warn other parents. This should NOT be used on baby&#x27;s sensitive areas. It gave my daughter a terrible reaction, turning her skin bright red.. Apparently, little ones are too sensitive to lavender and this product is resplendent with heavy scents. Classic new mom error. I felt so bad that something I sought out to act as a barrier against diaper rash gave my daughter a case of redness in the area I was trying to soothe. I had to go out and get a tube of old fashioned A &amp; D goop to right the wrong and it took about two weeks for the inflammation to vanish.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe useful to older children or as a hand salve, but I won&#x27;t be using this near any sensitive areas on anyone.</li>
    <li> I honestly could not attest as to whether or not this product treats existing diaper rashes because at two months old, our son has yet to get one. We don&#x27;t even use it every time we change him, just when he starts looking a little pink. Usually by the next time he&#x27;s ready for a new diaper, the mild irritation is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is neutral, not overpowering, and once he&#x27;s diapered and dressed we don&#x27;t even smell it. The consistency of this cream is nice - it spreads smoothly and easily across our baby&#x27;s skin, in addition to not being difficult to remove from our hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product is incapable of treating an extreme diaper rash and our luck with avoiding one doesn&#x27;t hold up, we will have no issues with having to resort to something stronger as a temporary measure. The fact that this product is completely natural makes it worth the slight inconvenience that it *may* not be the best for treatment if other reviewers&#x27; concerns are correct.

It&#x27;s much cheaper, and there are various (trial) sizes available.</li>
    <li> As first time parents, my BF and I forgot to start applying any sort of lotion/balm every time we changed out baby&#x27;s diapers. His little bottom got burned and it looked and seemed pretty painful as he screamed every time we changed him. After applying this product a few times, I could already see the difference. He healed pretty quickly and has never got burns or rashes ever since. Also, this balm smells great and gives your baby a sense of freshness.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! I&#x27;ve used it on both my kids. I&#x27;ve used it on any type of rashes or dry skin. It&#x27;s so natural, you could use it anywhere!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very portable and applies very smoothly. The amount is very little for the price, but I don&#x27;t need to put too much on the skin anyways. Works great and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
    <li> Love this balm! I tried several different organic and natural balms/lotions/etc for my baby&#x27;s chapped face. With Wisconsin brutal cold winters and dry air...this is the only product that worked on her poor cheeks! Her cheeks were soft within 24 hours of using it! It smells amazing! And it is locally (Wisconsin) made! Thanks Lusa!!! :-)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite diaper rash cream. We&#x27;ve tried many - in both cloth and disposable diapers. This is the one I keep going back to. It&#x27;s soothing and clears up rashes quickly. I apply at any sign of redness.</li>
    <li> I received this as a shower gift- I love it. I use disposable diapers, but have not had one ounce of redness or rash since he was born (5+months now). A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m ordering again for me and 2for shower gifts as well. I also received the massage oil which was wonderful to rub his little gassy tummy! And the chap chin balm- makes his face so soft plus a light clean scent everyone comments on!</li>
    <li> So good, the wife wants me to rub it on her pregnant belly instead of babys bits!</li>
    <li> This cleared up my daughter&#x27;s diaper rash in 1 day! We also use the Lusa baby wipe juice. The Lusa products are AMAZING!</li>
    <li> We cloth diaper and this is the only diaper rash cream we&#x27;ll use on my son. It&#x27;s all natural, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on his diapers. It&#x27;s pricey (and I&#x27;ve seen it cheaper elsewhere) but I recommend it to everyone, even moms who aren&#x27;t using cloth diapers. Any time my son has ever had ANY redness or irritation, I&#x27;ve used this and it&#x27;s cleared it up fairly quickly. You will not regret buying this!</li>
    <li> This product is cloth diaper safe and works great on any irritation or abrasion plus the product has an acceptable smell to it unlike many diaper products.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! It smells wonderful and works really well with cloth diapers or disposables. A couple of days of this on my baby&#x27;s bum and it&#x27;s all back to normal. Totally recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
