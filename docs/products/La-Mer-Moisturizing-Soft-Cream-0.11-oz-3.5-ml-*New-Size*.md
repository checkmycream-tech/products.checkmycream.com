      <li>Heard lot of good things about it, but the price got in the way.</li>

      <li>It did not cause breakouts, and I liked it.</li>

      <li>I also love the eye cream.</li>
      <li>Then it would be one more thing in my drawer of product disappointments..</li>
      <li>I love La Mer products.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using la Mer cream for more than 10 years.</li>
      <li>this was great as I could leave it in my travel cosmetic case and it would not weigh too much</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
      <li>But, I am happy to report, it DOES live up to the hype.</li>
      <li>Love the feel, formula is so advanced and healthy</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about La Mer!</li>
      <li>It easy for using and it work well with serum.</li>
      <li>This is a free sample and not for resale</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been fortunate to  </li>
      <li>The cream on face face feels fantastic , but the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; size????</li>
      <li>seller using the fact that the customer can&#x60;t compare on this image and the photo is SIGNIFICANTLY ENLARGED!!!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>I suspect that it is not the original La mer either.</li>
      <li>have been able to use this cream most of my adult life.</li>
      <li>Very soft and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>It shipped fast and I was pleased with the transaction, just not the product itself.</li>
      <li>To small but very good for skin.</li>
      <li>It has made my skin so soft and smooth, and I get compliments all the time on how great my skin looks, and how much younger I look as well.</li>
      <li>Love it leaves your skin so soft!</li>
      <li>Its worth the price.</li>
      <li>if you like natural remedies, this is the most scientifically proven one</li>
      <li>I just wanted something more moisturizing for night, so that&#x27;s why I tried the Soft Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I was glad when I finished this tiny jar</li>
      <li>Probably won&#x60;t even cover your whole face and neck for just 1 use!&lt;br /&gt;Total rip off!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I got an acne cyst and a pimple after the first five or so applications.</li>
      <li>I decided I finally should look into using a more moisturizing product, even though I still have oily skin and am prone to breakouts.</li>
      <li>It did feel good to have a fairly intense moisturizer on at night, when it didn&#x27;t matter if I looked greasy, and it didn&#x27;t feel heavy like it would in the heat of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This cream is very moist but also heals blemishes.</li>
      <li>I would not reorder because I really don&#x27;t know what the product can do.</li>
      <li>It did not do much aside be greasy and filmy</li>
      <li>I WILL be buying a full jar in the future, you can count on that.</li>
      <li>But I like this stuff and can not spend the full price currently</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-50s and, even at my age, have avoided using moisturizers, other than the occasional light oil free ones.</li>
      <li>Oxy is too drying now that I&#x27;m older, but  la mer seems to to the trick</li>
      <li>lol Sorry but its the truth.</li>
      <li>What if it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype?</li>
      <li>No breakouts from that so far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not definitive that the La Mer soft cream was the cause, but I imagine it was, so I&#x27;m stopping it.</li>
      <li>I used the La Mer soft cream maybe five nights or so, over my glycolic acid or Renova (depending on which night).</li>
      <li>I just used up my old jar and opened this one.</li>
      <li>(Btw, the Lotion is a lighter moisturizer than the Soft Cream).</li>
      <li>MY face is never dry in winter!!</li>
      <li>I feel cheated, and I barely can imagine that this amount would be 3.5</li>
      <li>you can barely stick</li>

<li> Not sure the price is reasonable.</li>
<li> I wanted to try this product for a long time.</li>
<li> But now that I&#x27;m middle aged</li>
<li> Was very surprised by how small the container was.</li>
<li> Although very expensive, it&#x27;s worth every red cent!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think that such small amounts should be sold for that price if a person is trying to see what a product has to offer.  </li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was such a small amount</li>
<li> Pay less for observation cream.</li>
<li> Even with this little trial size, I can tell a difference.</li>
<li> I ordered it a few weeks ago.</li>
<li> so I jumped at this chance to buy it for just a few dollars.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small this was.</li>
<li> : I wouldn&#x27;t think that this small size is counterfeit, though I do doubt that La Mer authorizes its sale on Amazon.</li>
<li> Dont like it way to small</li>
<li> Product is moisturizing, but the size (even though they described it) is about the size of the tip of a small thumb.</li>
<li> so no more $500 gift sets for me,</li>
<li> Nothing out of the ordinary</li>
<li> This was the sample size given to you at the LaMer counter...very disappointed with the price and the misleading comment on new size!</li>
<li> , really sucks.  </li>
<li> It was very small</li>
<li> Seems to me it would be hard to put fake product in a tube.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m addicted to this cream.</li>
<li> The jar was so small for $25.00 that it was impossible to determine just how the cream worked.  </li>
<li> I definitely recommend for anyone who has the money to spend, you will not be disappointed!</li>
<li> Ridiculously expensive.  </li>
<li> This is a fake product.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re worried about the product being fake and want this trial size, maybe order the La Mer moisturizing LOTION from Amazon, as it comes in a tube.</li>
<li> I use to be obsessed with this stuff.</li>
<li> What I did not know was that it was totally wrong for my skin in my 30&#x27;s,</li>
<li> FAKE.</li>
<li> What if I hated it?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nothing out of the ordinary</li>
    <li> To small but very good for skin.</li>
    <li> Very soft and smells amazing. Not sure the price is reasonable. I received what appeared to be a sample. But I like this stuff and can not spend the full price currently</li>
    <li> This stuff works miracles! Whether you buy it yourself or ask for it as a gift, you will see results in just a matter of a week or two. I use it every morning before makeup, and every night after washing my face. It has made my skin so soft and smooth, and I get compliments all the time on how great my skin looks, and how much younger I look as well. I definitely recommend for anyone who has the money to spend, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This was the sample size given to you at the LaMer counter...very disappointed with the price and the misleading comment on new size!</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff! Been wanting to try it for a while and finally did. I suggest this size before you invest.</li>
    <li> This is a free sample and not for resale&lt;br /&gt;And want a refund</li>
    <li> I use to be obsessed with this stuff. I have been on a budget for a while so no more $500 gift sets for me, but I wanted to have LA MER back in my life so I jumped at this chance to buy it for just a few dollars. It was very small but I knew that. What I did not know was that it was totally wrong for my skin in my 30&#x27;s, I 1st purchased this product when I was just 20, 21yo. At 33yo I can honestly say...I&#x27;m over it! It did not do much aside be greasy and filmy and I was glad when I finished this tiny jar so I could use it for something I loved when I travel...lol Sorry but its the truth. If you want to try it - buy it. Its worth the price. It shipped fast and I was pleased with the transaction, just not the product itself.</li>
    <li> This product labelled not for re-sale. I suspect that it is not the original La mer either. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It is good for taste the product. Pay less for observation cream. the face result is good.  It easy for using and it work well with serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using la Mer cream for more than 10 years. This cream are madre in China. No buying anymore from tus saler.</li>
    <li> Ridiculously expensive.  Product is moisturizing, but the size (even though they described it) is about the size of the tip of a small thumb.</li>
    <li> This is a very good cream. My mother noticed a difference within one day</li>
    <li> La Mer is incredible! Does wonders for your skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product for a long time. Heard lot of good things about it, but the price got in the way. What if I hated it? What if it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype? Then it would be one more thing in my drawer of product disappointments.. But, I am happy to report, it DOES live up to the hype. Even with this little trial size, I can tell a difference. Dewy, glowing skin. NO LIE. My skin looks freaking AWESOME. I WILL be buying a full jar in the future, you can count on that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this cream. I have combination skin with occasional breakouts. But now that I&#x27;m middle aged I need extra moisture too,to combat wrinkles. This cream is very moist but also heals blemishes. I actually spot treat blemishes with it like I used to do with oxy. Oxy is too drying now that I&#x27;m older, but  la mer seems to to the trick</li>
    <li> this was great as I could leave it in my travel cosmetic case and it would not weigh too much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-50s and, even at my age, have avoided using moisturizers, other than the occasional light oil free ones. I decided I finally should look into using a more moisturizing product, even though I still have oily skin and am prone to breakouts. Maybe more moisture would help fight wrinkles! I used the La Mer soft cream maybe five nights or so, over my glycolic acid or Renova (depending on which night). It did feel good to have a fairly intense moisturizer on at night, when it didn&#x27;t matter if I looked greasy, and it didn&#x27;t feel heavy like it would in the heat of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I got an acne cyst and a pimple after the first five or so applications. It&#x27;s not definitive that the La Mer soft cream was the cause, but I imagine it was, so I&#x27;m stopping it. I&#x27;m still iso of a heavy-ish moisturizer for night that doesn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered the La Mer Gel Cream in this same .11 oz size and used it during the day for maybe a week. It did not cause breakouts, and I liked it. I just wanted something more moisturizing for night, so that&#x27;s why I tried the Soft Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - about the review about this product as a suspected counterfeit: I wouldn&#x27;t think that this small size is counterfeit, though I do doubt that La Mer authorizes its sale on Amazon. I think this size is what they send as a sample when you order a standard-sized product from their website. If you&#x27;re worried about the product being fake and want this trial size, maybe order the La Mer moisturizing LOTION from Amazon, as it comes in a tube. Seems to me it would be hard to put fake product in a tube. (Btw, the Lotion is a lighter moisturizer than the Soft Cream). I have used the Lotion (in the mini-sized tube) and like it, but have only used it 3-4 times. No breakouts from that so far.</li>
    <li> I love La Mer products. The sample sizes are great for traveling. I also love the eye cream. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Top of the line. Love it. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small this was.</li>
    <li> Love it leaves your skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! Worth every penny!! your skin is beautiful, wrinkles fade. Its amazing!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! MY face is never dry in winter!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used La Mer Moisturizing cream for years. This is a fake product. I ordered it a few weeks ago. I just used up my old jar and opened this one. FAKE.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was such a small amount</li>
    <li> What a shame of the Seller.Folkes DO NOT BUY THIS!&lt;br /&gt;This item is about the size of a dime- maybe a stack of 10.That&#x60;s being said think about that the container is plastic- so that takes away from the amount cream you receive also.&lt;br /&gt;What you get for your money is a quarter of a teaspoon!!!! Probably won&#x60;t even cover your whole face and neck for just 1 use!&lt;br /&gt;Total rip off! I feel cheated, and I barely can imagine that this amount would be 3.5 ml.&lt;br /&gt;This seller using the fact that the customer can&#x60;t compare on this image and the photo is SIGNIFICANTLY ENLARGED!!!&lt;br /&gt;In any quality department store would offer you a sample - 3x more than this.&lt;br /&gt;BAD experience.</li>
    <li> great size for purse.</li>
    <li> This is a sampler, not for sale unit, beware!</li>
    <li> The cream on face face feels fantastic , but the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; size????, really sucks.  This is not a travel size, this is sample and for the cost......shame on you.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about La Mer! It&#x27;s magnificent and a wonder cream all in one. I&#x27;ve been fortunate to  have been able to use this cream most of my adult life. Although very expensive, it&#x27;s worth every red cent! Owned by Lauder.</li>
    <li> The jar was so small for $25.00 that it was impossible to determine just how the cream worked.  I don&#x27;t think that such small amounts should be sold for that price if a person is trying to see what a product has to offer.  I would not reorder because I really don&#x27;t know what the product can do.</li>
    <li> Dont like it way to small you can barely stick you&#x27;re finger in it</li>
    <li> Love the feel, formula is so advanced and healthy, I&#x27;m sold forever..if you like natural remedies, this is the most scientifically proven one</li>
    <li> Was very surprised by how small the container was.</li>
