      <li>Cost is right!</li>
      <li>but it does give you a good basic tan.</li>

      <li>Many of the tanning products on the market have such a strong scent or contain floral-based fragrances</li>
      <li>It helps so much while I tan indoors, and it dries quickly!  </li>
      <li>I keep going back to it because it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
      <li>The smell and color results make it all worth it though.</li>

      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I went with All American Tan because I trust their lotion is authentic.</li>
      <li>Just a nice, dark tan.  </li>
      <li>I would also recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin as it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and leaves the skin feeling soft instead of oily like a lot of tanning products, also no itching or redness.</li>

      <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>

      <li>Haha...</li>
      <li>Highly suggest getting this stuff!</li>
      <li>After careful review of many products and reviews I picked this lotion and I like it a lot.</li>
      <li>Maybe because I don&#x27;t go tan as much as other people do to keep a more darkish tan.</li>
      <li>Not worth more than $25.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this lotion &amp; Thee Tanman</li>

      <li>This is the only lotion I would ever get that has the first ingredient being water.</li>
      <li>I like the color of my tan which is lightly bronzed without being too dark.  </li>
      <li>It smelled exactly the same as the stuff from the salon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This lotion works very well, and smells great, i know it sounds odd but it even tastes good. i would recommend this to anyone. It is a great product</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;m confused about people on here talking about the smell of this lotion being anything less than AMAZING! It smells ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I even accidentally got some on my lips one day &amp; it even tastes amazing! After that, outta curiosity, I looked at the ingredient list..Well, it must be because it has fruit in it such as apple extract, raspberry seed oil, banana extract and even caramel!!!! WOW- yummy!! Haha...I can use this yummy concoction on my body AND face &amp; I get awesome color from it!! It took me from VERY pale-LITERALLY WHITE- German/Irish skin to a GOLDEN color in a matter of weeks, BUT I saw amazing color within the FIRST time using it! For taking me from as white as a sheet of paper to a natural golden bronze in a matter of weeks, I had to take a moment to write a good review on this stuff! ;) Signed, a happy customer</li>
    <li> After careful review of many products and reviews I picked this lotion and I like it a lot. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love it. It smells good plus you can use it indoor or outdoor so you only need one lotion</li>
    <li> Product smells good. It doesn&#x27;t leave you with the greasy feeling like most loations. But I don&#x27;t think it is really helping my color like other loations have. I feel like I&#x27;m getting lighter. I am using it as back up loation.</li>
    <li> I originally got a free packet of this lotion through the place where I tan along with a few other packets just for signing up. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the sent at first but I noticed that it didn&#x27;t seem to last as long through out the day as some of the others. I got great color on my first tan and didn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy. So I purchased a bottle through amazon and I am so happy that it was less than half the price it goes for at my salon! super satisfied</li>
    <li> Product arrived much sooner than estimated date. It was in perfect condition, and is the original product not a knockoff or anything that has been tampered with. I have been using this product for the last 2weeks now and I can already notice a difference it is providing for my tanning experience! I would also recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin as it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and leaves the skin feeling soft instead of oily like a lot of tanning products, also no itching or redness.</li>
    <li> Smells good and can tell after tanning that I&#x27;ve gotten a shade darker. would recommended Ravish Me over other Designer Skin Bronzers. I currently have at least three other bottles of different varieties of Designer Skin Bronzers and I can&#x27;t help but choose this one over them.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this lotion.  I like the color of my tan which is lightly bronzed without being too dark.  Cost is right!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  Smells great and leaves my skin super soft.  I will definitely buy this lotion again.  A+</li>
    <li> The smell going on is great but afterwards not great i got a fabulous tan though and the price was great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this two different summers while I tanned before a vacation (I am a VERY pale person who burns easy) and many people commented on how dark I got.  The scent is DIVINE and it never left any orange spots even when I didn&#x27;t rub it in very well and I never wiped it off between my fingers; NO ORANGE !!  Love it !!</li>
    <li> I like this tanning lotion, it doesn&#x27;t bronze as well as other tanning lotions but it does give you a good basic tan. Maybe because I don&#x27;t go tan as much as other people do to keep a more darkish tan.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for people who are either trying to set a base tan, light skinned or turn orange easily with bronzers. This lotion has bronzers that are subtle enough to look natural. The best way to describe the scent is that of a lemon flavored starburst.</li>
    <li> This product worked nicely. It smelled exactly the same as the stuff from the salon. Didn&#x27;t turn my hands orange!</li>
    <li> No problems with my allergies and it tastes great as well...tried and true...smells like fruity chocolate...3 more words requires&lt;br /&gt;d</li>
    <li> This stuff got me so tan sooo quick!!! The girl at the tanning salon sold me on it(for 60 bux!!!) I found it on here.. Same formula and all.. Amazing! Highly suggest getting this stuff! Smells so yummy too! And yes, for some reason, it&#x27;s even lickable too...lol even tho I wouldn&#x27;t do that after sweatin it up in a tanning bed lol!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and texture of this lotion! So luxurious!</li>
    <li> Got great color after just one use &amp; it smells amazing. Definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for lotion.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d get dark&lt;br /&gt;but not really it takes a while b 4 u see results&lt;br /&gt;Sorry but true</li>
    <li> I have used quite a few of Designer Skin tanning lotions and this by far is my favorite. It does have a fruity smell but not overwhelming. I find my color is nice and brown with a bronzing glow. After tan smell is not bad at all and makes me think of being in the sun with sun kissed skin. I will recommend this to all my tanning girls.</li>
    <li> I gave the 4 stars because of the smell and the bronzer which I both love. It&#x27;s a good lotion for beginners. Smells and tastes amazing. I didn&#x27;t give it the 5th star only because of the consistency. The first ingredient is water so it didn&#x27;t go on as we&#x27;ll as other lotions. This is the only lotion I would ever get that has the first ingredient being water. The smell and color results make it all worth it though. Great if you know you&#x27;re going on a date that night. You will smell delicious</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for over a year now, off and on.  I keep going back to it because it&#x27;s amazing.  Gets me dark, no orange color.  Smell is just okay (everyone&#x27;s taste is different.)  Not greasy, no streaking.  Just a nice, dark tan.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It smells great and it&#x27;s bronzer is also great! I was darker after my 2nd time using it. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This lotion did smell delicious, but it was very greasy. It didn&#x27;t absorb well like other lotions, and I didn&#x27;t get the deep tan I have gotten from other lotions as well. A lot of the lotion just stayed on the surface of my skin, and dried a tan color but could be rubbed off. It was okay for the price, and I did eventually get a nice golden look. I still prefer hot lotions, you get much more per session, and it stays much longer.</li>
    <li> Many of the reviews here discuss how well the product is absorbed, how well the bronzer works and how well it makes us smell. I would recommend this product for all of these reasons as well as for another reason. I suffer from scent-induced migraines when fragrances are strong or flowery. Many of the tanning products on the market have such a strong scent or contain floral-based fragrances so I struggle finding a good product that doesn&#x27;t cause me to suffer. Since I also use tanning to treat eczema, avoiding the tanning bed is not an option. Prior to finding this product, I&#x27;ve experienced my share of migraines. Now I am able to tan to treat my eczema by nourishing my skin, enjoy a nice, dark base tan, smell wonderful and enjoy the added benefit of not having to suffer from a migraine headache the remainder of the day. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on the smell. Every time I come out of the tanning bed someone asks me what I have on! I have sensitive skin and was amazed that this worked for me. I have been using this for a year! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve learned that bronzer isn&#x27;t for me. This is a bronzer. Nice packaging.Not worth more than $25. Maximum. I went with All American Tan because I trust their lotion is authentic.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, light feel and results on my fair skin and it looked natural. I would recommend it to anyone, any skin type and for whatever results you would like.  Tastes good too :)</li>
    <li> the smell wasn&#x27;t as nice as some of the reviews said it would be, but it wasn&#x27;t awful either. I think it has given me a good tan.</li>
    <li> Love it and so much cheaper!!</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time today, it smells great and works awesome, can see some brozing as soon as you put it on!!</li>
    <li> Smells feminine and fresh, helps hydrate my skin, applies well and helps attain a better tan. I mostly use tanning lotion for the hydration (as tanning dries out my skin alot) and the smell, and this works great.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  It helps so much while I tan indoors, and it dries quickly!  Great smell and texture as well!</li>
    <li> This product helped increase my tan, moisturize my skin and left it smelling great afterwards. Good for the bed or the sun.</li>
    <li> I love it! It makes me tan. It smells good afterwards too! I highly recommend this lotion &amp; Thee Tanman it shipped super fast. I got it within three days and it said it would come in five!</li>
    <li> Liked,would reorder this product again my daughter also liked this would also recommend ravish me lotion to someone else,,,So buy this one if your undecided.</li>
