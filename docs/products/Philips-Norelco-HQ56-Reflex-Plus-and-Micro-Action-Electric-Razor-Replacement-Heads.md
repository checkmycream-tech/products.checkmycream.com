<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was great. I am retired so I do not shave every day. This meets my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> I thought  was getting  a new top with the heads but only got the new heads.  But they are good.</li>
    <li> This works great for my husband shaver.  You just have to make sure you get the right one for the correct model.</li>
    <li> YOU SHOULD REALLY CHANGE YOUR BLADES EVERY YEAR OR TWO. YOU IMMEDIATELY NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE NEW BLADES MAKE.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original blades that came with the shaver. Gives a rough shave.</li>
    <li> Not worth much. I would recommend buying a better shaver instead...</li>
    <li> Could not find this anywhere else.  My husband very pleased.</li>
    <li> I actually called Norelco&#x27;s help line, as the website gave a wholly different head number that no longer exists for my ancient razor.  They said these fit, and they did and work fine!  Also, the woman at Norelco was very pleasant and helpful</li>
    <li> These make an old razor work like new.  I like razors with a cord and these fit my two old Norelco razors.  Well pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with the razor so I wont need to order them down the road.. I highly recommend this item</li>
    <li> heads turn like any other regardless of price of shaver&lt;br /&gt;heads fit on any other regardless of price of shaver&lt;br /&gt;heads are the same price of shaver&lt;br /&gt;shave is like any other regardless of price of shaver&lt;br /&gt;great price!</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for years because the new heads make it like new-recommend to all with electric shaver</li>
    <li> At the time of this writing, the Norelco 6945 is $21 on Amazon.  The Norelco 6945 includes HQ56 heads!  That means for about the same price as these heads, you can get a whole shaver including the heads you want!</li>
    <li> Very good replacement with good sharp blades!</li>
    <li> Vey good - no problems.---Like</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type of razor blade for the past 8 years, six days a week.  That should say enough.</li>
    <li> The new razors work great and even lessens the time to shave now.  I would definitely buy these again if my razor motor holds out until the next replacement.</li>
    <li> This is the electric razor that is strong enough to be used to shave my head bald.  After cutting my hair short with a pair of scissors, I keep my head shaved bald by shaving daily with this electric razor.  I find this elecric razor too strong to shave my beard because it cut my beard too short  and irritate my skin.  I always find a red mark or two on my face after shaving with this razor.  But it is just right to shave my scalp and keep my hair short enough to look bald.  So everyday I need to shave my scalp bald with this Philips Norelco electric razor but on my face I shave my beard with a Baud electric razor which don&#x27;t irritate my face.  I love both type of electric razors.</li>
    <li> Not bad,but description doesn&#x27;t show enough info</li>
    <li> Fit my razor perfectly</li>
    <li> finally getting a good shave!!</li>
    <li> these work great. I&#x27;ll be buying new ones soon had them about a year now</li>
    <li> Imagine my chagrin at reading Norelco&#x27;s recommendation of replacing these blades every 6 months to a year.  With almost 10 years on my original blades, I was getting frustrated with my poor shaving experiences with my wonderful (at new) Norelco shaver.  A new equivelent was near $200 and frankly, this shaver wasn&#x27;t broken, just worn... New blades might be the answer.  I got on Amazon.com and found them easily, priced competitively, and with prior experience with Amazon, I ordered them.  They arrived a couple of days later (earlier than expected) and immediately went to work.  I have a new shaver!  for the price of the blades!  Great price, great product &#x3D; great experience.</li>
    <li> Great shaving heads not very expensive.</li>
    <li> I needed new blades for my Norelco 4417LC &amp; these were the perfect choice. Easy install &amp; a really good close shave. Made my electric razor just like new. Will I be buying these blades again? You bet!!</li>
    <li> My old shaver needed a refresh and this certainly did it.  The shaver works like a new one out of the box.  Amazing what a new set of shaver heads will do.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> My shaver was approaching a 100,000 miles, and was just too dull.  Buying this blade insert is like a new shaver, not to forget much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I first bought a Norelco rotating reflex head shaver in the late 1970&#x27;s -- I was a grad student with very little money but scraped enough together to buy the razor (expensive back then) because a close friend recommended it.  This technology immediately proved to give a terrific, easy shave, and I have stayed with the Norelco shaver line ever since. The so-called &amp;#34;Lift and Cut&amp;#34; configuration has two sets of angled, stacked blades in the rotating shaver head, and I have every reason to believe that Norelco&#x27;s illustrations and claims of their special effectiveness are correct.  For many years I simply bought the least expensive Norelco reflex razor every few years and did not bother with replacement heads (a set of heads costs more than half of what the lowest-priced razor model costs). Razor performance during this period of about 20 years was always great -- as the saying goes, they will have to pry these razors out of my cold, dead hands.  Then, with the advent of Amazon and eBay, my approach changed in recent years. Instead of buying new razors, I began saving some money by buying sets of new replacement heads on Amazon. Also, I really liked this low-end, powerful Norelco 6423LC model that Norelco had discontinued.  This model is not rechargeable but gives better shaves than the weaker rechargeable models, and it is also great for travel because it automatically adjusts to 120 or 240 volts.  So, more recently I bought a few used 6423LC&#x27;s on eBay and set them aside so that I would always have at least one for many years to come.  After a few years of using replacement heads from Amazon, it gradually dawned on me that shaving had become a lot harder -- it took a lot more time, more passes, and harder pressure to complete a shave. The degradation in shaving experience was kind of subtle at first but eventually I reached the conclusion that maybe something was really, really wrong with the replacement heads. And it got to be very irritating indeed, figuratively and literally on the skin.  I also bought and tried &amp;#34;Vollco Sharpening Heads&amp;#34;, which are designed to hone the edges of worn-down Norelco reflex razor heads, but these did not succeed at all in getting me back to a great, easy shave.  I reluctantly began to consider the possibility that the replacement heads from Amazon were counterfeit. On the face of it this seems pretty improbable, because the head blades themselves are very intricate little devices with very close dimensional tolerances. It seemed impossible that counterfeiters would develop the expensive equipment and processing skill to make a crummy imitation version of Norelco&#x27;s heads and still hope to make money on them.  Nonetheless, about 9 months ago I decided to do a test by purchasing replacement heads directly from the Norelco website. I put a couple of sets into the shopping cart and tried to check out, but the process repeatedly failed and I gave up back then. What are the odds, right? I figured maybe I was just wasting my time. However, a few weeks ago I traveled to see my sister and brother-in-law, and I threw one of my used razors from eBay into my carry-on.  Now, one thing I learned early on with these razors is that you have to empty out the shavings every time you use them in order to avoid buildup and jamming. So, every morning I pull off the head assembly and tap it against the sink.  To my surprise on the first morning using the eBay razor, there was about twice as much whisker material down the wall of the sink bowl as I was accustomed to seeing after every shave. It was pretty dramatic, especially given that the razor had been used for an unknown number of shaves before I bought it on eBay.  So, when I got home a few days later I went back to the Norelco website and persevered until, with their customer service help, I got two sets of replacement heads ordered and delivered. Two days ago I loaded in a new set and turned on the razor.  Big surprise at the outset -- it actually sounded noticeably different from what I had generally been hearing from various Norelco razors and head sets over the years. And the shave was, finally, terrific and easy again! I did not expect this at all, because it seems so COMPLETELY improbable that someone would go to the trouble of counterfeiting these intricate little devices.  But with three new facts in hand (changed sound, more whisker material, and really great, fast shave again), the conclusion, however improbable, seems incontrovertible -- there is something wrong with the replacement heads.  All things considered, my best guess is that these replacement heads sold on Amazon actually do come from the same factory in China where the good ones from Norelco are made, but are somehow being diverted and stolen from the production line at a point before some sort of final, critical manufacturing step(s) is carried out.  For example, though I&#x27;m not a metallurgist, I do know that there are some highly specialized techniques and expensive equipment for hardening the surfaces of cutting edges, such as by using metal sputtering or ion implantation to harden just the first few layers of atoms on a metallic surface or edge. These techniques can create highly specialized alloy surfaces or whatever.  If Norelco&#x27;s factory has high security for heads emerging from a final processing step but misses diversion and theft of heads from an earlier point in the production process, that would explain all the facts without having to invoke the idea of a totally separate counterfeiting plant.  Obviously I will buy replacement heads ONLY from Norelco in the future.  I hope this review helps some people. I will be happy to provide whatever information I can to help skeptics understand that this review is genuine. For example, I have (i) emails from Norelco&#x27;s website showing my failed purchase attempt much earlier this year and the successful purchase a week ago, plus (ii) records of all my eBay razor purchases, and (iii) my purchases of replacement heads from Amazon: Feb 26, 2007; Feb 10, 2008; Dec 20, 2009; Dec 12, 2010; Aug 5, 2011; Aug 21, 2012; July 29, 2013; and the Vollco sharpeners on Aug 21, 2012.  I have nothing to gain from publicizing this information -- I&#x27;m just very pleased indeed with the outcome and grateful to Norelco for putting out a fine product for several decades now.  DEC. 17, 2015 UPDATE:  BAD NEWS -- about two months ago I bought two more sets of replacement heads directly from Norelco.  The first set that I tried were very poor, much like the ones I bought previously on Amazon.  It looks like counterfeit or otherwise impaired replacement heads are now contaminating Norelco&#x27;s inventory.  I will try to alert Norelco to this problem.  JULY 21, 2016 UPDATE:  regardless of what heads you buy, be sure to follow the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation to apply standard razor head LUBRICATING OIL before the first use and at least once per month afterwards.  You will get better shaves and the heads will stay sharp much longer.</li>
    <li> Great replacement parts ....</li>
    <li> Everything that I expected in both blade types.</li>
    <li> Works as they should.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Norelco 5814XL and they fit just fine. My only problem was the blades don&#x27;t seem much better than the old ones I replaced. When my old ones were new it would take a couple passes and I&#x27;m done (they lasted 5 years), but these new ones take 4+ (the worn out old ones took around 8 or so). I don&#x27;t grow hair fast and even though I like a close shave it shouldn&#x27;t take much to shave it off.</li>
    <li> I replace mine every year. Works great and a better price than the local stores.</li>
    <li> I meant to order a different model head but realized I had ordered the wrong one when they arrived.  I was able to return them in exchange for the correct ones.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second set of replacement heads I have purchased for my Norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;the new ones work great.  Shipping was prompt and price was competitive.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first replacement set from WalMart, but they no longer carry heads for older models.</li>
    <li> This helped my old razor to recover . It is now same as new and does the job. Good for leg hair too!!</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are high quality, and they made my old Norelco shaver like new again. While replacement every six months is recommended, I think that for occasional use they can be replaced much less frequently and remain quite effective!</li>
    <li> These heads replaced the ones that I&#x27;ve used for several years which had never been replaced before. I could tell there was some improvement but it was not as much as I expected. The real question is whether they will last as long as the original set. I understand they should be replaced every several months.  That is more often than works for me.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time &amp; as advertised.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected, To soon to predict duration.</li>
    <li> They do a fine job, but I guess I expected more. The blades in my razor were 16 years old. The reason I bought the new one&#x27;s, was the foils were broken, and I was scratching my face. I do get a much smoother shave now, and I don&#x27;t wince, when I put aftershave  lotion on.</li>
    <li> My shaver says &amp;#34;use only heads NRHQ55&amp;#34; but this item was a perfect replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Made the shaver work like new.</li>
    <li> Get the real thing, they actually last.</li>
    <li> Works ok but slower than my previous Norelco but that may be because it is cordless. Shave is close with no razor burn and quiet. Having used this now for 2.5 years and it still works well. I use it about 8 days before it needs a charge and that includes face and head every day. Good batteries!</li>
    <li> Sent to my dad he is happy with it thank you!</li>
    <li> Item was exactly what was needed.  Price was much lower than other sites that I checked and this was the best value.</li>
    <li> Fit precisely into a norelco 715RL in terms of HQ4 compatibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a closer shave with new heads installed, then again the old blades had been in there for at least 4 years. Heads seem to wear horizontally across grill, rather than the rotating blades part, comparing to old heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, amazon had a uncommon grocery store item for less than MSRP, and close to the price 10 years ago.</li>
    <li> great bargain satisfied</li>
    <li> This is a good replacement for your shaver, keep in mind whenever you replace these on your shaver it takes a little while to get readjusted to the new shave.</li>
    <li> It was really bad ones.</li>
    <li> Product was received on time, in good condition and as advertised. I am satisfied, and would order again.</li>
    <li> Works like a new one ! What more can I say?</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and accurate.</li>
    <li> This replacement kit was just what I needed to get my razor cutting like new.. It was half the price than the store</li>
    <li> This is exactly what was needed and hard to find locally . . . the price was great and the item arrived very quickly.  Does the job perfectly !</li>
    <li> Worked very well in my razor, and the price was good.</li>
    <li> It is a good replacement for the original set and they seem to work adequately to the point that I will reorder as necessary.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive since my razor calls for HQ55 replacement blades; but these HQ56 blades fit perfectly and I&#x27;ve tried a shave once and it came out great!!</li>
    <li> great PRODUCT as expected</li>
    <li> The razor is very good and easy to replace with worn out razor head. I highly recommend this razor head.</li>
    <li> Makes my razor sharp again. Perfect.</li>
    <li> These work perfect in my Norelco.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace my current razor heads when they became dull. I ordered these twice. The first set was extremely dull and would just rip the hair off of your, rather than cutting it. I figured it was mistake, and re-ordered another set, which were the exact same quality. I have switched to a Mach3 razor (manual, not electric) now, which have been much better.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement heads, fit perfect.</li>
    <li> I had the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; set of heads in my Norelco since 20-FEB-2010.  I decided the quality of my shave had degraded so I searched Amazon for replacement heads (blade and guard assemblies).  Based on one, perhaps more, reviews of products sold through Amazon I decided to go directly to the Philips on-line store to be certain I received their genuine products.  With the new set in hand - not in the shaver - I prepped my face as always and shaved one half of my face.  Then I cleaned the shaver and installed the new heads and shaved the other half of my face.  Without my wife knowing which side of my face was shaved with the old and which with the new I asked her to judge.  She conducted both a visual and feel test and carefully selected the side of my face shaved with the OLD blades.  I personally couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between the old and new heads.  I think the official Philips heads were a waste of money.  Regards, Ken C</li>
    <li> I have had the Norelco shaver for over 20 yrs original heads, I was well pleased with the delivery of expedience and it works like a new shaver will be replacing the heads in another identical shaver soon.</li>
    <li> The picture makes it look like the whole head is replaceable but this is just the little circle blades. They work fine , but It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
    <li> Norelco blades gave new life to old razor and a smooth shave once again.  In hindsight, I should have ordered 2 sets so that I could just replace them as needed...without the delay of ordering and shipping.  Prior to order,  I did contact Phillips Norelco (PN) to insure I was ordering the correct shave heads for my unit.  PN was very helpful.</li>
    <li> Worked excellent, couldn&#x27;t tell any difference from the original when they were new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Bill</li>
    <li> Works well, let&#x27;s hope they last longer than the original blades</li>
    <li> DO NOT SAVE WHEN WEARING GLASSES..  THEY CAN RUIN THE SCREEN!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking for over a year for replacement blades for my old Norelco 985RX. I wasn&#x27;t sure I would find anything to fit.  But, of course, Amazon came to the rescue yet again.  Now I have smooth shaves every morning without worrying about cuts and scrapes.</li>
    <li> Is advertised to work in place of HQ55 replacement head, it really causes the razor to pull down.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and son have razors that had gotten dull so I ordered two of this product and their razors are like new again!</li>
    <li> Works well on shaver. Delivery was outstanding...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say much more than they work as good as when the shaver was new.  You need to replace them at least once a year, or, when you have to really work at getting a smooth shave and it seems to take too long.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the HQ4 blades on my 725RL Norelco.  Perfect fit and replacement and, after a day or two to settle in, the razor now shaves closer than ever before!</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to replace.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, fits my old razor, and at a low price.  The only place to shop is Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband needed and wanted the shaver heads and was pleased to get it so quickly and it works great for him!</li>
    <li> Product of very good quality ... I recommend it 100% and I would not hesitate to buy it again. I like!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Norelco Shaver Replacement Heads for my corded Norelco shaver (I have no idea what the huge benefit is of a colorless shaver. I currently use the Micro Action Plus Model 5426LC.  The last time I purchased Norelco Shaver Replacement Heads (for the very same shaver), it was the HQ4 Plus. Before that, I bought the HQ4.  The Norelco Hq56/52 fit perfectly and works as well as the previous models.  [Is there something about Shaver Replacement Heads and \\&quot;coin\\&quot; sized batteries that requires the makers to constantly change the model number for no good reason? Is this a mild irritant to anyone else?]   The product was delivered promptly and in perfect shape. I recommend the purchase of this product, and it is sold on Amazon for a fair price.</li>
    <li> I am impressed that new blades truly do make quite a difference. I was of a mind my blades were self sharpening but these new blades really do give me a closer shave. Now my wife lets me close again.</li>
    <li> always very expensive, I hope offers like this</li>
    <li> this is the second replacement for the original Hq55 head -- and this is much improved!  It shaves close and smooth, and is quiet.  So glad that this improved replacement is available!</li>
    <li> Quality and a good price. Nice to have new replacements in my razor. Happy to buy these from Amazon too. These heads would be $53 US ($70 NZD) if bought in New Zealand. I know where I&#x27;m coming to get my next set.</li>
    <li> Replacement blades are good but unless I have an extremely rough beard I seem to dull them out sooner then I think I should. Really breaks out my neck. Otherwise for what they are they do what they are suppose to. For how long may very per person</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve replaced the batteries in my shaver when they wore out so I thought new blades would be a great idea.  It was.</li>
    <li> no improvement in this newer head gives me razor bumps..had to buy a new shaver that just came out on the market.</li>
    <li> I installed them in my shaver but it does not cut my beard</li>
    <li> This replacement for my Norelco unit was easy to install in my unit and it was very easy to order the product.</li>
    <li> Easy installation. Shaves as well as it ever did.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I received it very promply and would recommend it to every body. works good. I will reorder when I need another</li>
    <li> My shaver is an older model, 6423 LC, with printed on it use the now superseded HQ55+ head.  The HQ56 Reflex Plus heads are a drop in replacement and work fine.  This is the first time I ever replaced the heads on my shaver since I got it years ago.  I am sure that the new heads are sharper and if I did not shave everyday would feel a significant decrease in pull.  But, because I do shave everyday pull even with my old heads was not significant.  The main thing I was hoping to achieve with the new heads was reduced shaving time, i.e., fewer passes over the same area to get all the whiskers. Unfortunately, I have noticed only a minor decrease in shaving time.</li>
    <li> This product is made in the Netherlands, so your purchase supports a democracy. (The product description merely says &amp;#34;Imported&amp;#34; which could mean any country.)</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, they just don&#x27;t male electric razors like they used to.  My old razor works much better than the modern ones being put out today.  The problem is: where do you replace the razor heads when they have worn out.  Well, now I know the answer.  My life is much better and my shave is much closer.</li>
    <li> One thing I noticed missing in the reviews and no one seems to have called it out yet. There has been no mention of weekly blade maintenance or maybe I didn&#x27;t go deep enough into reviews (over 500). Perhaps it is too much trouble, maybe Norelco just wants something else to sell, or both; but I&#x27;m pretty sure that the blades would last a bit closer to a full year w/o significant dulling if the weekly lube of the blades were performed per HQ110 shaving lube instructions. The blades for my 3405LC last a full year w/quarterly lubing instead of weekly. Of course, this might depend greatly on the texture of one&#x27;s whiskers. Let the rebuttals begin !  Not hating, just saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers !</li>
    <li> They fit the razor well and is cutting like new again.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave. Really easy to install and use. Doesn&#x27;t bite or knick if you push too hard. Go team go</li>
    <li> arrived quickly work well  my old one wore out only had to go 1 day with out shaving&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco HQ56 Reflex Plus and micro action electric razor does not seam to do the job! ELECTRIC SHAVERS-------REALLY</li>
    <li> BEEN LOOKING for replacement heads for my norelco shaver, no place locally carried them or were higher priced, looked on amazon, found them ! after checking the reviews, i learned that this unit was what i needed even at a much lower price. works great and fits my shaver perfectly, could not be happier, amazon came thru again GREAT JOB !</li>
    <li> Had to have my shaver for over 5 years an never replaced the heads. I needed new heads, so I found these on Amazon for a much better price then in the stores, so I purchased them. They are just great. Well pleased.  Richard</li>
    <li> Worked great, easy install. You&#x27;ll notice the difference.</li>
    <li> I bought my Philips-Norelco electric razor for $29.95. The blades went dull in just 3 months of shaving twice a week. The replacement heads cost between $25 and $40. WTF?</li>
    <li> A perfectly acceptable replacement for the old HQ5 heads on my older shaver. Works better than new.</li>
    <li> Good, but didn&#x27;t notice that much of improvement in cutting ability.</li>
    <li> The product works well.  No problems experienced.</li>
    <li> While I rated the product high I am very disappointed that the tooth pick that was also suppose to be part of my order was not included or back ordered. Apparently the order process was not as easy as it should have been. Another reason to not shop on line.</li>
    <li> great deal and fast shipping</li>
    <li> gets dull really fast</li>
    <li> I renew these every 6 months. It makes a big difference in shaving smoothness. I use a standard plug-in electric because I have no need for battery powered, and the batteries eventually wear out and are not consumer serviceable.</li>
    <li> it did not fit my razor. my razor is a norelco 905rx. it was very hard to tell what the replacement should be and i made a best guess</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my very old Norelco razor that has gone at least 16 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I greatly dislike electric razors (I recommend Fusion ProGlide with a proper shaving technique), I do keep my electric razor around for touchups and travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These replacement heads are quality and work as expected.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed and at a great price. Locally these are so high priced it is actually cheaper to buy a whole new razor instead of just the shaving heads. These were just as advertised and work perfectly. I recommend these shaving heads.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades and grill brought new life   to my old electric razor.  This may be as good as a new again.  I won&#x27;t wait so long to replace the blades again.</li>
    <li> I forgot how well new blades cut. It&#x27;s a lot less expensive than buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> These arrived on time in original packaging.  Once I replaced my old ones I could tell the difference immediately.  What a good deal!</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND SAYS THEY WORK FINE!  &amp;#34;iT REALLY PERKED UP MY WHISKER WHISKING,&amp;#34; ACCORDING TO HIM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUSAN (IN AND FOR RALPH)</li>
    <li> Does not feel the same as my originals or previous orders, but it&#x27;s the only choice at this point. I might have to invest in a new purchase.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement head</li>
    <li> Long time user. Set a date on the calendar and buy replacements every year. Hope the don&#x27;t discontinue them before I have to break down and buy a new shaver.</li>
    <li> The product actually came like someone opened it and found out it was the wrong item, but it did have the correct, new, original items in it. I paid way less than the MSRP for it and it functions properly, so I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> When you cringe over the cost of the new 3,4,or 5 edge razor blade, just pick up your Norelco razor for a fast clean shave.  Throw that messy shaving cream away!</li>
    <li> Very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made by the Razor&#x27;s manufacturer..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use Amazon to buy the associated&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Philips HQ110 Shaver Head Cleaning and Lubricant Spray 4oz &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards, Don</li>
    <li> I got these because my razor had the same heads for ~ 6 years. I use it 6-7 days per week for my face, and honestly I can&#x27;t tell any difference in shave closeness or quality between the gross old blades and these brand new ones. Probably won&#x27;t bother replacing again with this same razor.</li>
    <li> not as sharp as the originals</li>
    <li> I have an older 6617X that I couldn&#x27;t find the HQ55+ replacement heads in store anywhere. Glad I was able to find these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Norelco 3405LC shaver for at least 15 years. The replacement part used to be HQ4, but the HQ4 is no longer made by Norelco, although there are 3rd party vendors selling their own \\&quot;HQ4\\&quot; knock off.  I just wanted to let others know that, while it&#x27;s not listed anywhere on the web nor on the box - these HQ56 shaver heads DO fit my 3405LC shaver perfectly and work great!</li>
    <li> This product works about as well as the original factory equipped parts but I would not say that it equaled them. The parts were much better than the knock-offs that are sold elsewhere for a bargain price. My razor has some miles on it and that may explain the performance issues.</li>
    <li> These heads replaced the original ones in my electric razor and were a perfect fit.  Fast shipping, a good price and a better shave...what more could you ask for!</li>
    <li> Installation of these new blades in my Norelco shave took less than five minutes.  The shaver is has served me for 15 years and has only been serviced by a technition once. Now with a convenient was to get and install new blades, I as set for another decade. :o)</li>
    <li> the only thing bad i have to say is that I consider this replacements to be a little expensive considering the razors price! but it is great</li>
    <li> Not to much I can say about these, except that they work just like the original, except they are sharp.</li>
    <li> I thought that was to be razors and the head as originally I needed just a head for my dad&#x27;s old Norelco.  I should&#x27;ve spent a few minutmes more and look through all images.  So I had to spend twice buying razors and a head.  My dad is very satisfied after all.  However, I could&#x27;ve saved if didn&#x27;t have to buy all things separately.</li>
    <li> Good product, reasonable price and excellent, fast service. I was very pleased. Replacing the blades is certainly cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my plug in razor for years.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve changed blades.  This should extend life of razor some more years.  No big improvement, but some improvement in shave.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality blade set up.  I did nor relize how dull my old blades were.  Takes half the time to shave.</li>
    <li> This was the real McCoy - package was the original blue box.  Price was great - I&#x27;ve kept this item in my Nextag account to see if it drops even more.  I would recommend to a friend ... go for it!</li>
    <li> Genuine Norelco replacement heads at a reasonable price. Nothing more needs to be said.</li>
    <li> Loved the price.  Better than in any store and&lt;br /&gt;saved buying new ones.&lt;br /&gt;My husband really likes the razor so didn&#x27;t want&lt;br /&gt;to have to buy new.</li>
    <li> Nice clean cut and easy to clean heads....Good buy and hopefully it will last a long time. I prefer corded over battery.</li>
    <li> Jim paschall. My wife the close clean even shave. I use my after shave and drive her crazy .she chases me around the house.</li>
    <li> the products was received in said time and in good shape. Although the part number was different from what the manufacture book required, the blades fit razor as needed and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This replacement part suited my needs.  It arrived as promised.  It was a good price and a good deal. I was pleased.</li>
    <li> These saved me from purchasing a new razor. My husband lost one of the round cutters when he was cleaning it. I was about to buy another razor when I saw this product. It fits perfectly and is exactly like the original. Very happy with purchase and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco for years and this was for a head replacement. what more can I say.AAAA  ++++To many words</li>
    <li> My razor requires the HQ55+, and I purchased these as the HQ56 is the &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; replacement of the HQ56+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had been well over six months since I last replaced my blades, and I could feel how dull they were. I noticed frequent razor burn, irritation, and a 3 o&#x27;clock shadow after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited when they arrived, so I could have some relief for my poor shave every morning. Unfortunately, these blades were WORSE! In addition to having stubble after every shave and continued irritation, it felt like every hair was being pulled out of my face, but never cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if these are knock-offs or just poor workmanship, but I was very disappointed and disposed of them after one week.</li>
    <li> I called and was told these heads would fit my husbands razor.  They did not. They were not even close.</li>
    <li> Get these parts actually made by Philips/Norelco. I tried the half-the-cost brand (chinese?-came in plastic bag with part # only), and you get what you pay for. Had to put my 2-1/2 year old actual Norelco parts back in and got a better shave than the new cheap ones.</li>
    <li> Great product will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I opened the package and it was the three tiny round blades, not the whole head of the razor. But being my first time, I was able to change the blades and clean the razor in about 2 minutes, super easy and now its like having a new razor.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Exactly what we need for our older razor. Works perfectly.  Thankfully Amazon has what we needed.  Thrilled I now know where to get this item.</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades that made shaving easy. If you aren&#x27;t replacing your razor&#x27;s blade&#x27;s regularly, you are missing out! These are very cost effective and affordable compared to some big-box stores near my place, so I was very happy with the price and value. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> nICE SMOOTH SHAVE AGAIN</li>
    <li> Husband very happy will be getting more!</li>
    <li> Gives a really nice, close shave easily and swiftly. Love my Norelco! I used to shave IN the shower in order to get as close a shave as possible. No need to any longer.</li>
    <li> The blade this replaced cuts better then then one. It is very dull or something. This is the correct serial number for my current razor. Not sure what the issue is.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with razor heads</li>
    <li> Even thought i brought this as a spare, I took it out of the warping to make sure it fits. Perfect.</li>
    <li> These HQ56 heads work as a replacement for the HQ55+ heads in my old Norelco Reflex Plus shaver.  The HQ56 heads fit right in and work well with no issues.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised, delivered quickly, at the price stated.  It doesn&#x27;t get much better than that.  We will remember and use this service again.</li>
    <li> These fit and worked just like original equipment in my Norelco triple head razor. It&#x27;s nice to have sharp blades again</li>
    <li> Why did I wait so long to buy a replacement head. You do not realize how dull your electric razor has become until you replace it. Easy to make the switch and well worth it.</li>
    <li> I like the Norelco shaver. Of course each time a  little different  and better. I have used them for 30+years.</li>
    <li> I needed these as the ones on my Norelco razor needed replacment. I coukld not find any locally and if i would have they would have been more expensive</li>
    <li> I have tried about ever electric shaver made in the past 30 years and Norelco Philips always comes out on top. All three of my shavers (home, car, office) use the HQ56 blade and they do the job.</li>
    <li> I bought these heads as replacements for the heads in my old 965RX Norelco razor which I had used for many years. I was disappointed as I had to work pretty hard to get a close shave. I purchased a new 8240 XL Norelco razor and was very pleased with its results. It had the HQ9 heads which gave a very fast, smooth comfortable shave. It is possible the HQ56 heads may have been damaged in the mail since the package they were in was mashed flat but they did appeared to be okay and they sounded normal when the razor was turned on.</li>
    <li> husband said they work great</li>
    <li> Buying these shaver replacement heads online is a big savings and my husband has had good service from them.</li>
    <li> The HQ56 out performed the HQ55 when it was new.  I was ready to buy a different razor when I tried the HQ56.  Great razor plan to keep it.  Much closer shave in half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lou</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy a new electric razor if your old one still has a good motor. Just get these replacement heads and it will work like new again! In my case I had to replace the NiCd batteries as well. It was still worth it, even so!</li>
    <li> The new blades made my razor good as new.  Received them in timely fashion with reasonable packing.  Would recommend to others</li>
    <li> My Husband just loves it. Couldn,t have got him a better Christmas Gift. Works great!! T.Y. I Will Tell All My Friends.</li>
    <li> I now get a very close shave with my new razor heads. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t include the shroud like the photograph shows, it is only the blades and the rings/foils they ride in.&lt;br /&gt;I put them into an ancient razor and the fit perfectly and worked well but didn&#x27;t improve the shaving quality to any appreciable degree.  I found that somewhat surprising as the old blades are probably 10 yrs old or more.&lt;br /&gt;Since the razor itself was in great condition I got this instead of a new razor&lt;br /&gt;I could probably put the old blades back in and wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for someone that has a good razor with a damaged blade or foil.&lt;br /&gt;Use it to repair a damaged razor.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the blades and foils is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I derated it for 2 reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1) it really isn&#x27;t clear that it doesn&#x27;t include the shroud and the packaging certainly does nothing to remove that misconception.&lt;br /&gt;2) the manufacturer recommends blade changes on a yearly or more frequent basis and the benefit is minimal.</li>
    <li> Excellent fit for my shave machine....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sons razor and he said it&#x27;s just like new.  Easy  to replace and as always,Norelco is the best</li>
    <li> Installed and cutting just as expected.  Getting a smooth shave every time.</li>
    <li> Surprised they sill made razor heads for their older razors.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a bit over a year since I replaced my old ones, so it&#x27;s nice that they last so long. The ones I ordered work pretty good and I hope after some time they&#x27;ll &amp;#34;wear in&amp;#34; and do better....I can&#x27;t remember, but I think that happens whenever you replace them.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> They are just fine. one two three four 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 this is the end.</li>
    <li> The shaving heads made my shaver run like new.  Much less expensive than in the stores (if you could them).</li>
    <li> These new replacement blade heads (the HQ56 Reflex Plus) work great on my older model Norelco shaver.  After installing the new blade heads, the shaver worked like when it was brand new.  I definitely recommend the micro action replacement razor blade heads.</li>
    <li> it was time to replace the blades in my shaver [actually way past] and the information on the site helped me get the exact fit even though they don&#x27;t make my model shaver anymore.  It fit and works perfectly</li>
    <li> I use these all the time very good product gives me a close shave my razor is over 10 years old keeps on going...</li>
    <li> I forgot just how well this shaver worked when it was new.  The blades were easy to replace.  I should have done this a lot sooner.</li>
    <li> husband loves it but can&#x27;t buy it in the store - have to go online which is annoying but easier</li>
    <li> replacement heads work well, but are a little expensive (the replacement heads cost about 50% the price of an new razor complete with heads.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like the heads should be 50% of the cost of the complete razor and charge,</li>
    <li> What can I say they are official norelco parts and at a great price. Better than the others that cost more than shaver initially did.</li>
    <li> Replace your shaver heads once a year.  Your shaver will run like brand new.  Amazon has cheapest price around.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It is always nice to have a good shave with sharp heads on the shaver.  Package arrived early and it was well packed.  I certainly will re-order again.</li>
    <li> a product that works as advertised.  useful to everyone and will be appreciated for it&#x27;s functionallity.  an item worth having.</li>
    <li> original Norelco factory parts. Exact fit and replacement. Made my shaver new again. If you want the best get your elk a factory parts. Great price for a quality product.</li>
    <li> Adequate packaging and rompt delivery of item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to replace heads. Have used these for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> The heads performed better than anticipated. My morning shaves seemed closer. I am very please with the purchase and the outcome.</li>
    <li> I have a VERY old Norelco-well over 20 years (not even on the blade conversion charts)-and had not replaced the blades in at least 8 years, so it was time. The HQ56 are performing well. Initially, I could not detect any real difference; however, after several uses it seems they have &amp;#34;adjusted&amp;#34; themselves and are now cutting without any binding of the skin or discomfort with the longer beard hair being pulled. Would definitely recommend if you want to save $15-$65 on a new shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a replacment for an older model Norelco. It is OK, not a great razor, less power than mu old one.</li>
    <li> Hubby likes the replacement razors w/ new razor.</li>
    <li> An alternative to purchasing a new razor, easy to shop on line, free delivery&lt;br /&gt;Much better than hunting these down in a retail store</li>
    <li> My Norelco Electric razor just wasn&#x27;t doing it job any longer. The HQ56 replacement blades brought the performance level back to my expectations!</li>
    <li> The Norelco head I bought has really helped. I agree with them that I need to change it every year.</li>
    <li> Quick change out from the old to the new.  They seem to work fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! very happy.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads work great. It&#x27;s like having a new razor. After I replace the blades the battery charge lasts longer since I don&#x27;t have to go over the same places on my face so many times.</li>
    <li> It seemed to be a competent product in the description, and in fact all present observations confirm that. Works well.</li>
    <li> changed the shaving blades and ejoyed a smooth facial skin without the rash from the old shaving head. will continue to replace head yearly</li>
    <li> Necessary, but seem to be soft metal needing frequent replacement.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find these replacement heads in any stores, so I was relieved to find I could obtain them through Amazon at a good price.  They arrived in good order and I am already getting better shaves.  If you need them, you can buy these with confidence.</li>
    <li> These are better blades than the HQ55 and cheaper as well. I recommend these blades. I don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT, TIMELY SENT,</li>
    <li> I use this electric razor blade since 1996. I am satisfied with its results after replacing the heads.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d got it long before I did!!!</li>
    <li> Reasonable price, accurate description, quick delivery. A+</li>
    <li> So Far several years of daily shaving.</li>
    <li> good price as advertised</li>
    <li> The HQ56 works great and gives my shave an extra close look.  My old blade worked reasonably well for over 10 years.  These particular blades are more expense that others but they exceed my personal expectations</li>
    <li> I need to replace all the blade systems in my shavers.  I will be ordering a couple more of these units. They work great compared to my 20 year old cutters...</li>
    <li> Nice basic level, economical shaver. As many have stated, last of the old corded shavers. Decent quality and effective results. Watch out when taking this shaver apart for cleaning. Its more challenging to piece back together properly than you would think..</li>
    <li> I never was tottaly altogether satisfied with the lift and cut or whatever it&#x27;s name, but I read the instruction book and put in the new blades  and now I really like it-does a good job and thank you. one favor please - the cradle or support of one blade is a bit broken - I can still use it but would appreciate a new one. If you need to contact me, telephone # is&lt;br /&gt;320 634 3456</li>
    <li> The face shaver in our household is very happy to have new blades, easy to install.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered.</li>
    <li> Great price and speedy shipping.  If I recall correctly, this item had a $5.00 off coupon, making the deal even better.</li>
    <li> Only moderately satisfied with the close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the battery function</li>
    <li> Had to ask Philips customer service which blade size fit my ancient shaver, since it&#x27;s not easy to find out anymore. Once installed, they work as any other Philips/Norelco blades - great the first week, then slowly taper off. I don&#x27;t find it necessary to replace the blades annually, they last much longer.</li>
    <li> I am a bit disappointed with these replacement heads.  They don&#x27;t appear to shave much better than the 1.5 year old ones they replaced.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the prices at the store.&lt;br /&gt;Incredible.  Amazon.com is the best.&lt;br /&gt;I really should shop more here, especially since I live 90 miles from the nearest WalMart (a small one).  130 miles to a big WalMart.</li>
    <li> I have owned my Norelco shaver since 2009, and should have changed the blades long before now. But I don&#x27;t use it every day, because it just doesn&#x27;t give a close shave like a wet blade does.  There must have been a problem with the original blades that I didn&#x27;t realize, but it&#x27;s GREAT now.  Maybe these are Gen 2 blades?  Almost bought a new shaver instead of blades- glad I didn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> it works great  a wonderful  razor gives a great shave would buy this again, recommended to friends thanks so much</li>
    <li> Impossible  to assemble</li>
    <li> These replacement blades are just the ticket if your shaver is still running good but has lost its sharpness.  Easy to replace and then back in business for a fraction of the cost of a new razor.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the new Phillips Norelco heads.  They fit great, and do a great job.  Appear to be high quality.</li>
    <li> Blades work well - fit unit.  Have used Norelco shaver for about fifty years and would never go back to shaving cream</li>
    <li> Fit my Norelco HQ55 razor perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great Replacement blades for a cheap razor. When this razor dies I will spend the money on a good Norelco razor.</li>
    <li> Very poor, should be a minus 10 stars.  Something is not right in the fit to my razor and am extremely disappointed in vendor &amp; Amazon.</li>
    <li> I thought it was the whole attachment, it was just the three blades, and combs.&lt;br /&gt;Worked for Dad.&lt;br /&gt;He was happy after using his razor for many years.&lt;br /&gt;He knew what to do to replace.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy.&lt;br /&gt;It does take about three weeks for the razor to self-sharpen to the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;Best price on the internet, half the cost in the stores.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for a great price....I didn&#x27;t have to go out and buy a new shaver...I just needed to replace the heads.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT - THANK YOU VERY MUCH</li>
    <li> These replacement heads fit perfectly in my old razor and work well.  These are the first replacement heads I&#x27;ve purchased in the life of the razor, which is now about 25 years old.  The old ones worked well as long as I disassembled and cleaned the heads several times per year.  The new ones are noticeably sharper and make shaving quicker.</li>
    <li> Fit my travel Norelco just fine.  I used to use HQ 55+, but these fit just fine.</li>
    <li> Perfect, no problems, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Good product as listed. Good price. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> My husband needed the heads replaced.on his razor  I bought the same ones aboutr 2 years ago and he was happy with it I was happy to see I could still order the same ones.  They arrived very quickly and he&#x27;s been happy with it/</li>
    <li> Great price, however blades still leave a little stubble.  Might be my beard.  Will use though, I will not throw out my razor.</li>
    <li> Cuts nicely, large improvement over the ones that were on there and had been worn down. Just don&#x27;t be fooled by the subscription option, you really only need new ones once a year. It was trying to ask me to buy once every three months, that seems excessive</li>
    <li> perfect fit for replacement heads, works great.</li>
    <li> Five stars is the minimum rating for such a good product. It was exactly what I&#x27;ve expected and needed from that.</li>
    <li> Why did I not consider an electric shaver years ago?  My skin is dry and thin, due to a medical condition.  The Norelco does not chafe or cut my skin.  The price at Amazon is lower than at local stores.  The time required is less than with a traditional razor.  I no longer buy shave lotion and blades.&lt;br /&gt;One feature bothers me, at times.  The electric cord pulls out of the shaver while I am using it.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I am well satisfied.</li>
    <li> This Electric Razor shaver head is very good&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an exact replacement for my Norelco Shaver&lt;br /&gt;the blades are sharp and improve shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy a new shaver head next year (recommended)</li>
    <li> As mentioned in title fits in a much older (10yr+) old shaver, model 5801XL. Now it works Like new again</li>
    <li> good service and product worked well</li>
    <li> Today received my replacement heads (3)so I immediately replaced my old heads.&lt;br /&gt;It felt so smooth cutting my beard, no pulling like before. Thanks Amazon for&lt;br /&gt;this item plus the others I&#x27;ve purchased. Amazon is numbero uno!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;George</li>
    <li> There should not be any bad reviews on these great blades and&lt;br /&gt;I will buy these again from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;They are so sharp and cut so smooth and lasts a long time and&lt;br /&gt;are a great price for these blades.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these blades to everyone.</li>
    <li> Same product, cheaper than the store, ordered from my couch. Need I say more?</li>
    <li> There does indeed appear to be a different engineering to these replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;The effect is to make a smoother shave. However the question remains; Is the price a good&lt;br /&gt;value? Well time will answer this question. Phillips (Norelco) would like us to replace&lt;br /&gt;the heads every year. Sure! How about every week? I used to be able to extend the life of&lt;br /&gt;heads with sandpaper.  I don&#x27;t know if that will work with the new \\&quot;split\\&quot; tines.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied  Works like a new razor</li>
    <li> Hubs is  happy now !  :D</li>
    <li> Received the right item that I ordered at a good price and delivery was quick with no damage, will shop again. THANKS</li>
    <li> Works great with my Norelco (4406LC) shaver. No problems at all so far. Clean shave with no irritation to my skin.</li>
    <li> These made my old razor cut like new. I should have purchased them sooner. Easy to install and good price.</li>
    <li> did not fit my razor because the back of the blades did not meets the razor parts therefore their blades were not turning.</li>
    <li> Performs just as promised allowing you to maintain your old shaver with a clean cut that does not hurt your skin. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t believe the difference this blades make to your electric razor!  Typically I have to shave with blade razor to get a close shave before I go out for work or a social engagement.  My wife complains on the weekend because my face feels like it has cactus spines from me not shaving.  I use the electric razor in the evening before going to a social gathering because I don&#x27;t want to use a blade razor every time.  When I replaced the blades on my electric shaver I expected a slight improvement, however, I was immensely surprised when it gave me such a close shave that I didn&#x27;t need to shave the next morning.  Now I use the electric shaver once on the weekend to keep me in good graces with my wife.  If you have tough facial hair like me you will notice the difference.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement head for one of my 3 Norelco razors because the old one doesn&#x27;t cut my beard anymore. And, the new one is no better. It just slides over my face leaving the hairs mostly uncut. I have tried every pre-shave lotion known to the industry to no avail. I&#x27;ve tried dry, wet, Skin Bracer Pre-Shave, and Pre-Aft from Italy, and nothing helps. I&#x27;ve tried their expensive new Architec razor with the internal pumped Nivea cream, which is a huge pain, as you have to disassemble the clogged cutters and clean the head after every shave. It does a little better in the shower, but you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;I simply give up trying to get a reasonably clean shave with the Norelco razors.</li>
    <li> Product works well with the Norelco 6900 Series razor which specifies the HQ55 blades.  These blades are the right fit, as other reviewers have noted.</li>
    <li> I have all ways used this product and it is by far the best price I&#x27;ve come across keek it up guys</li>
    <li> Item arrived as expected and has performed well. Price was less than any where else.&lt;br /&gt;these blades seem to stay sharp longer than the one years expected life.</li>
    <li> Product was just as advertised. Worked as well as expected. A replacement for the original blades that I had used for many many years. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Seem somewhat sharper than my old blades but expected better.</li>
    <li> Both the new razor  and the replacement head we ordered work well.  After installing the new head in our old razor, we now have two great razors. Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Made the razor like new again. Better price than in local department store. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> good and a good price.</li>
    <li> Top quality item and reasonably priced</li>
    <li> Good original shaving heads for my older razor. Price was acceptable. Good original shaving heads for my older razor. Price was acceptable.</li>
    <li> The heads fit and work fine. That is what I expected. Nothing special, just a good product. It would be good if there was a tool to sharpen them available.</li>
    <li> mad shaving a lot bettter</li>
    <li> works well, and fit into an old norelco razor.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades recently because my old shaver was not doing a good job.  The blades worked great, were good price and take less time to shave than my old blades.  This is a replacement for the hq55 blade.  it fits the same shavers and works perfectly.  the blades cam in good time and the blades were shiny and new when I opened box.  I think as long as you keep these blades clean, then you should get good shave.  I also think that before someone spends a lot of money on a new razor, I would highly suggest that you try new blades first.  I figure if these blades work good for a year or so, then I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Quality product that gives a close shave and is easy to install in your electric razor.  Great price at Amazon.com!  Will extend the life of you razor another 6 months to 2 years.</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s product description, as of the writing of this review, says this \\&quot;Replaces philips norelco hq55 shaver heads.\\&quot; Despite their aversion to the capitalization of proper nouns, I assume they are talking about the [[ASIN:B00009RB1C Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex  Replacement Heads]], which is what I had been using up until Amazon seemingly stopped carrying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can confirm these replacement heads work with the 6843XL, which is what I use. The box says to replace them every twelve months, but I&#x27;ve been replacing them every six. I find it&#x27;s better for my skin, and the six-month Subscribe &amp; Save delivery interval lets me roll on autopilot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So which other razors will these replacement heads fit? I have no idea, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box says they fit: 31DB, 6423, 6613, 6843, 6853, 6863, 6940.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the box for the [[ASIN:B00009RB1C Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads]] -- which Amazon says this product replaces -- indicates they fit the following models: 34--, 36--, 38--, 44--, 46--, 48--, 66--, 69--, 5413, 5426, 5430, 5625, 5812, 5813, 5817, 5820, 5823, 5824, 6405, 6415, 6423, 6424, 6445, 6831, 6842, 6843, 6844, 6849, 6853, 6854, 6855, 6856, 6857, 6859, 6861, 6863, 6868, 6874, 6879. The Amazon description adds: 6940, 6423LC, 6613X, 6843XL, 6853XL, 6863XL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, the Philips Norelco website says to use these HQ56 replacement heads (or the HQ55 version) with the following \\&quot;Reflex Plus\\&quot; shaver models: 6940LC, 6863XL, 6853XL, 6843XL, 6615X, 6614X, 6613X, 6424LC, 6423LC, 5812XL, 5625X, 5426LC, 4885, 4865, 4861, 4853, 4852, 4845, 4825, 4821, 4817, 4816, 4807, 4805, 4625, 4608, 4607,4606, 4605, 4604, 4603, 4602, 4601, 4417, 4414, 4413, 4406, 4404, 4403, 4402, 4401, 3865, 3805, 3801, 3605, 3604, 3601, 3405, 1608, 1606, 1605, 1604, 1602, 1601, 1337C, 1328, 1327, 1323, 1319, 1318, 985, 968, 965, 955, 950, 945, 935, 915, 905, 900, 895, 885, 875, 850, 835, 825, 815, 805, 800, 750, 725, 720, 715, 710, 705, 700, 665, 605, 600, 505, 501, 500, 486, 484, 482, 410, 400, 300, 200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally (for real!), the Philips Norelco websites says these HQ56 heads can also be used for these \\&quot;Reflex Action\\&quot; shavers: 5887XL, 5886XL, 5885XL, 5867XL, 5865XL, 5864XL, 5863XL, 5862XL, 5861XL, 5855XL, 5849XL, 5848XL, 5845XL, 5842XL, 5841XL, 5825XL, 5822XL, 5821XL, 5818XL, 5817XL, 5814XL, 5811XL, 5810XL, 5803XL, 5802XL, 5801XL, 5699X, 5606X, 5605X, 5604X, 5603X, 5602X, 5601X. These shavers can also use [[ASIN:B000050B6B Philips Norelco HQ5 Shaving Heads]], which are still available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, assuming these are truly a replacement for the [[ASIN:B00009RB1C Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads]], they should fit any of the model numbers listed above!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in the Netherlands.5, 600, 505, 501, 500, 486, 484, 482, 410, 400, 300, 200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally (for real!), the Philips Norelco websites says these HQ56 heads can also be used for these \\&quot;Reflex Action\\&quot; shavers: 5887XL, 5886XL, 5885XL, 5867XL, 5865XL, 5864XL, 5863XL, 5862XL, 5861XL, 5855XL, 5849XL, 5848XL, 5845XL, 5842XL, 5841XL, 5825XL, 5822XL, 5821XL, 5818XL, 5817XL, 5814XL, 5811XL, 5810XL, 5803XL, 5802XL, 5801XL, 5699X, 5606X, 5605X, 5604X, 5603X, 5602X, 5601X.

    <li> Wish I had done this looong ago. I really never replaced my blades since I purchased shaver 2 years ago. Not sure why, but now that I have I will be sure to do so @ least once a year. Used to spend 20 minutes shaving .. now I spend 5. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband. Rather than buy a new razor and save the moneys for a new winter coat for him</li>
    <li> I have an old Norelco 4821XL that I bought in May of 2000. Seems as though every time I go to change the heads, there is a new part number. I dunno. Went to the Phillips/Norelco site and it said these were the correct heads for my razor. You pay your money and you take your chances, I spoze.  They shipped quickly and these appear to be authentic. Popped &#x27;em in and they work great! You don&#x27;t notice how dull the old heads have become until you install a new set. I&#x27;m ordering another set so I don&#x27;t have to go through the hunting process again next time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and quiet and he says it does a good job. No base to leave plugged in. Just plug it in when you need it. Good price.</li>
    <li> Great Brand Name blades for my Norelco razor.  Cuts like new now!</li>
    <li> I love these replacement heads because the waste and environmental impact are so small. Great job, Philips Norelco!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE May 2015: Got a new set last week.  We had trouble fitting them into the razor.  Eventually the razor stopped working completely.  Fortunately, my husband saved the old heads.  You can see that the new ones, with the purple middles, are completely different.  They have half as many teeth, so they do not cut AT ALL.  Even the logo on the middle of the head is different from the old one and the one on the package photo.  This was exactly the same item we ordered last time.  The logo on the razor cover on the packaging does not match the razor cover on the new heads.  When we got the replacement order the day after I placed the return order, we got the right ones, and the logo matched the old ones and the packaging.  Not sure what happened, but be sure to check when your order arrives, because Amazon will make it right if they&#x27;re the wrong blade set!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s working as it was promised very easy to install, works for a month i used it, and it&#x27;s much chipper to replace the heads when to buy a new razor</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my shaver about 30 years and never replace the blades !. It was getting to the point where it wasn&#x27;t cutting very close, soon as I replaced the blades voila! I&#x27;m getting a very close shave again</li>
    <li> JUST AS EXPECTED WORKS GREAT</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re shaving blades so it&#x27;s hard to get excited about reviewing them! They work&lt;br /&gt;though none of them seem to last as long as one would hope.</li>
    <li> These blades work well in my shaver.</li>
    <li> blades cut well and for good price</li>
    <li> my shaver stopped working do to the fact that the heads wore out. they are now making these in plastic. older ones were not made that way. this is must for anyone with the newer norelco shaver&#x27;s</li>
    <li> New blades make all the difference in a razor. These have extended the life of my electric razor for years.</li>
    <li> Hadnt changed mine out in 5 years and a nice difference.  hey do what they are designed to; cut hair.  Not much else to say..</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I just like my old razor , keep on changing batteries and heads, and it keeps on giving me good shave!</li>
    <li> Good idea to offer it right away when buying the razor - years later it is more difficult to find the accessories.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my boyfriend, because his Norelco needed new blades. He put them in and he said his razor works like new! Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, they arrived today.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> This was a good buy as well being very convient to purchase.  No running from store to store and not being&lt;br /&gt;able to find what was need.  Thanks- for being there.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat customer.  I have replaced my Norelco shaving head three times in the last five years.  this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I made the unfortunate mistake of buying Chinese imitation blades for my shaver. Although they looked the same, and cost only a few dollars less, they pulled out more hairs than they cut. I then broke down and bought these, which are the real McCoy. If you think about it, the most important thing about a shave is how it cuts, and that depends completely on the blades. Stick with the real thing.</li>
    <li> I like this item for everyday used after shower for shaving. it is easy and used and it is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT A  Philips Norelco 6940 Reflex Action Men&#x27;s Shaving System AND  NEED TO CHANGE THE Philips Norelco HQ56 Reflex Plus and Micro Action Electric Razor Replacement Heads. SO, 365 DAYS LATER I WILL USE THIS ITEM IN ORDER TO OBTAIN WONDERFULL RAZORS.</li>
    <li> These are perfect replacement blades from the original P/N at a great price. It is great not wasting time with the worn blades.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find these anywhere anymore. Had mine original blade for over 15 years. used it for emergencies. Then decided to go electric and wanted new blades. Don&#x27;t know if i can tell the difference from old and new. haha</li>
    <li> The old heads had developed gaps that were cause discomfort in shaving and actually had nicked me several times.  Put the new heads on and the shaver is just like a new one, giving a close yet comfortable shave.  The toughest part was trying to decide on which heads hq55, hq55Plus or hq56 to purchase, all which fit my razor.&lt;br /&gt;John M</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I had expected. My husband&#x27;s razor was an older model and I wasn&#x27;t sure what particular blades were needed. It worked great</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the universal sub for discontinued HQ-4, HQ-4+ and HQ&#x3D;5 and now HQ-55. it does the job. At least Philips/Norelco did not abandon the old customers.</li>
    <li> Use this regularly and saves me money because I never buy Shave gel any more.....&lt;br /&gt;  Will surely buy it again.</li>
    <li> These heads were perfect replacements for the original ones that came with my Norelco HQ55+ shaver. It is only a minor disassembly job to remove the old ones and put in these. I am delighted to experience a smooth, non-pulling shave again with the new replacement razor heads.</li>
    <li> These heads are replacements for the Norelco 2100 shaver.  They give a pretty close shave and last a long time.  Price wise, they are a pretty good value.  Especially if you go on to the Norelco site.  They&#x27;re more expensive there.</li>
    <li> The new shaving heads/blades fit my razor with no problems.</li>
    <li> Fits my european HQ6645 perfectly. Sharp and accurate razor</li>
    <li> one did not seem to be as close cut as the other after 3 tries .</li>
    <li> much improvement over the original cutter.</li>
    <li> Not the top of the line in electric shavers, but serviceable nevertheless.</li>
    <li> excellent product and a good price</li>
    <li> I was going to buy a new electric razor, but bought the new heads. Works like its new. Their was nice older gentleman in town that sharpened the blades, but he passed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
    <li> An very high quality Norelco product. It replaced much used shaving head. I expect a long service with this one too.</li>
    <li> These heads are Incredibly dull, pull like mad and very  uncomfortable to use. These cannot be from Norelco despite the packaging.</li>
    <li> Razor is battery powered &amp; works very well. I carry it in my suitcase where I may not be able to plug a razor in to recharge. It is small, easy to travel with &amp; gives an excellent share. Still using blades that came with razor. These are spares.</li>
    <li> I searched for HQ55 replacement heads and they are no longer available.  These HQ56 heads are the replacement for them.  They fit perfectly and give a very good shave.  I thought I would have to buy a new shaver for several times the price of these because I could not find the old designated heads.</li>
    <li> was looking for a way to replace the shaver heads in my Norelco razor, without buying another shaver, (in my area, the replacement heads cost more than the basic shavers, so, so far I have amassed 4 shavers!!).  These work perfectly, and I was able to replace the heads in three of the shavers, so now I have one for home, office, and vacation house.  GREAT!!</li>
    <li> My razor works just like new, I have an older model 4413LC electric shaver that is more than 10 years old. These replacement blades fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> that is the only one there will fit my shaver can find it in the store so lucky found it on this site after have talk to a person about what will fit my shaver so i got it</li>
    <li> Love the razor, but as it is an older model, I have had a hard time find replacement blades.  My wife claim you can find anything on amazon, I was happy to find these, with prime I had in two days.</li>
    <li> Product fitted correctly on razor. New sharp blades give a much improved shave over the old blunt blades. Purchase price was good - much better than I could obtain in my own country. Local price of $90+ for 3 heads. Amazon price was $40 delivered.</li>
    <li> This is a way cheaper route to take when you want a razor upgrade.  I highly recommend this item if your razor&#x27;s more than 3 years old.</li>
    <li> A brand-new and unopened package.  The lowest price available on the internet.  Works perfect!  No need to shop anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Fit my razor, works great and didn&#x27;t have to deal with anyone at the big box stores to get them!</li>
    <li> On time and as expected!</li>
    <li> After two uses, one of the shaving heads broke, and there is no warranty or a way to get a replacement without having to buy another set.</li>
    <li> The razor is like new</li>
    <li> Shaver heads worked as expected.  It&#x27;s nice to get a fresh set of blades every 3-6 months under the auto-delivery subscription program.</li>
    <li> I have an old Norelco 5810XL electric razor.  The HQ5 blades that I had been using did not cut very close and dulled quickly.  At their best, they struggled with more than a day&#x27;s growth.  The HQ56 blades are a world of difference.  They provide a close and comfortable cut on a 1-2 day growth.  Also, these blades are quieter than the HQ5 blades.</li>
    <li> I have had a Norelco rotary shaver for almost 15 years. Before retiring, I shaved with it 6 days a week.  Now only 3 days a week.  The old blades, (original), were starting to pull my whiskers.  Now I have new blades and starting anew.  They weren&#x27;t much better the first few shaves, but I think that they are breaking in and I am getting a pretty good shave now.  I saved about 5 bucks buying from Amazon over WalMart which is just a mile away.  I could wait the few extra days since I waited over a decade for new blades.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband,  works well in his razor, much cheaper than in sttores&lt;br /&gt;nice clean shave we both like it</li>
    <li> Was beginning to think I&#x27;d have to buy a new razor when I searched on Amazon and found the replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s Norelco.  They fit the razor perfectly and now it shaves just like it did when it was brand new.  Great find.</li>
    <li> improved the performance of the razor and it didn&#x27;t cost the price of a new razor.  will reorder every year</li>
    <li> Nice close shave! Like having a new razor, only cheaper.</li>
    <li> I buy these all the time and replace the heads about every 3 months or so. There as inexpensive here as anywhere.</li>
    <li> My dad&#x27;s been using an older norelco for years, I don&#x27;t know if he ever changed the heads.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this, cleaned his filthy razor and replaced the heads in less than 2 min, and its like a new razor again..&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s happy, his shaving takes a lot less time and doesn&#x27;t leave stragglers..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this highly, especially at amazon&#x27;s price</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know what i could say except it does what it was designed for.it took long enough time to find one.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets for my 2 razors.  Put one in and shaved - felt just like the old set I replaced, poor, slow, and had to make several passes to get even a decent shave.  Put the other set in the other razor, same deal.  I have bought new heads before and was always amazed at how good the shave was upon replacement.  Not this time, not on either razor.  Don&#x27;t know where they are getting these, they are in Norelco packaging, but they sure don&#x27;t do what is expected.  POOR POOR quality.</li>
    <li> From the picture it shows the head with the three cutters attached.  Only the cutters were supplied making the installation of them onto the original head more challenging.  I think this should be clarified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have discovered with a previous Norelco that after several years of use, the original shaving heads  appeared ready for replacement.  Accidently, I had let the battery go dead so I set it up for charging with the shaver in the run mode and left the room.  Two hours later I heard it running on its own.  The heads cut like new thanks to the resharpening over the two hour period.  Try this before buying new heads!</li>
    <li> My father acknowledged the new razors as good as it gets.</li>
    <li> perfect for my razor, half the price I would pay for in Belgium.  Nothing wrong with that except that NORELCO is dutch  not too far away from my home</li>
    <li> I was not disappointed.  Wish I would have done this much sooner as it made my razor work like it was new again.  Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think they make the replacement blades my shaver calls for anymore but these fit just fine; still rocking a Phillips Norelco 6613X.</li>
    <li> This is Norelco&#x27;s generic head for a number of shavers including those which use the HQ 55+ head. It fits as advertised, but it does not seem to give me a close a shave as the HQ 55+ did.</li>
    <li> I could not find blades for my 5801XL razor so ---I did not go on line to search. After 15+years I deserved a new razor; the battery was not holding a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a new 150$ Norelco last year.  I left it plugged in, in the charger, for ~ a year of reasonably good performance.&lt;br /&gt;The battery failed in the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know,&amp;#34; you may not leave it plugged in for very long or the battery will fail&amp;#34;, the instructions claim. Alas, the instructions are correct.&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco service line was very measured in their response to me, and would not replace the razor, but would give me a credit for some portion of a new one. No thank you, I&#x27;ll figure out something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 24$ Norelco that you plug in to recharge.  Another mistake, it was like a toy razor for your son; all sloppy fit and no power, left it plugged in to use it. I am disgusted now! (with myself mostly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Amazon site I found my blades and battery, I replaced the battery and the blade set and now I am retired and happy !!</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly in my shaver and really improved the final results.</li>
    <li> Great value, delivered quickly</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement blades, makes the razor work like new again!</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> These were for my father.  He&#x27;s a complainer but had no problem with these replacement blades.  Little on the pricey side though.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely worth the price and, considering that they&#x27;re almost the same price as certain established online auction sites, you can&#x27;t go wrong when coupled with Amazon&#x27;s flexibility for returns...just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, there was no need for any concerns or returns.  This was exactly as described and I would steadfastly recommend to a friend, as well as buy again.</li>
    <li> Good price .... fit razor perfectly</li>
    <li> I ordered the HQ55 and was sent the HQ56 model. This is a much poorer model that fits the same electric razor. Save you money as this will disappoint you.</li>
    <li> OEM shaving head replacement as advertised...easy install and shaver works like new again... took longer to open the package than to install the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> works as expected and brought the old razor back to life along with a new battery. replacing the blades taught me that I had not been thorough cleaning it in the past. unable to see build up under cover without removing the blades  periodically. new model razor are crazy expensive for a similar unit. this was a much more cost effective way to go for now.</li>
    <li> These fit my Norelco razor that originally called for the HG55+ perfectly.  These are much cheaper and I would highly suggest ordering them instead of the HQ55+.</li>
    <li> They are definitely what I ordered, but they don&#x27;t work as well as the one that can with the razor originally.</li>
    <li> These brought new life to my old shaver. I was ready to throw it away. It was well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> works like new  and snapped right in place.  We will order again when it&#x27;s time.  Thanks for the great pricing too.</li>
    <li> Refer  to my comments above. If it ain&#x27;t broken why fix it. Emmm Emmm emmm GOOOOD. I like this replacement head.</li>
    <li> Works fine as a replacement for HQ5--I could buy a new shaver for what they want for the HQ5. This is a section of what I found on line (I am not guaranteeing anything, just reporting): &amp;#34;...the Philips Norelco websites says these HQ56 heads can also be used for these &amp;#34;Reflex Action&amp;#34; shavers: 5887XL, 5886XL, 5885XL, 5867XL, 5865XL, 5864XL, 5863XL, 5862XL, 5861XL, 5855XL, 5849XL, 5848XL, 5845XL, 5842XL, 5841XL, 5825XL, 5822XL, 5821XL, 5818XL, 5817XL, 5814XL, 5811XL, 5810XL, 5803XL, 5802XL, 5801XL, 5699X, 5606X, 5605X, 5604X, 5603X, 5602X, 5601X. These shavers can also use Philips Norelco HQ5 Shaving Heads, which are still available on ...&amp;#34; «</li>
    <li> I got the replacement blades in what seem to be an original Phillips Norelco box but when I replaced the blades on the shaver but no shaving what so ever I had to put the old blades back to be able to shave. I don&#x27;t believe these are original product but a poor fake</li>
    <li> Came within a reasonable time was exactly what we were looking for.  Also, came for a good price.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very effective, but for a person that shaves everyday they last less than 1year. Anyway, the manufacturer recommends that they&#x27;re replaced every 6 months, which obviously I don&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> The first package that I got from Amazon was damaged and I had to return it, because no one wants to cut with used razor blades; this is the same situation.  About 4 days later I got a new package in the mail and said to myself &amp;#34;wow that was fast.&amp;#34;  Put the new cutting heads into my razor and tried them out.  Huge difference with new blades, felt even better with these than the original ones on the razor!  Well worth the money and I would still only buy these things on Amazon even with the issues.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco triple head razors since the 70&#x27;s.  I love the shavers, but am often disappointed that replacement blades cost almost as much as a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this great deal for replacement blades, I bought them to replace the heads on my 4 year old model 6940.  They slipped in easily and made the razor like new again.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Fixed my old razor so that it works like new.</li>
    <li> It works. My previous blades didn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;lift and cut&amp;#34; function, (just the &amp;#34;cutting one&amp;#34;, obviously!). These blades are an upgrade for the basic version of the Norelco Razor. You can actually see the difference in the blades.</li>
    <li> Awesome product it dif was the blades to my razor that needed replacing as they say every year.</li>
    <li> Got the wrong kind and can replaced?</li>
    <li> What a rip-off. I assumed &amp;#34;3 heads&#x27; meant 3-sets. My bad, as this is a set of 3 heads for one razor. For $5 more I could have bought a brand new razor.</li>
    <li> Shaves with replacement heads have met all expectations.  Getting better, easier shaves now compared for my originals which were 1.5 years old.</li>
    <li> I had to reuse one of the round screens because one was defective out of the package. Works great otherwise.</li>
    <li> my Norelco is several years old &amp; stopped cutting well so I looked into these new blades.&lt;br /&gt;They seemed expensive for what they are but  Amazon emailed me a discount coupon so i ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;Before it came I opened the shaver and cleaned our some longer hair that was stuck around the blade hub.&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned it out and they work as good as new. I&#x27;m saving my new HQ56 for when and if my present blades ever seen dull.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and not irritating at all. Good value that comes with second set of blades.</li>
    <li> order it every year.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Nice new blades do work better.  Don&#x27;t wait six years to replace your blades.</li>
    <li> Like everything else,blades wear out and these fit my shaver perfectly and gave me a clean,pull-less shave!Will replace my other shavers&#x27; heads when they wear out.</li>
    <li> The shaver heads are beautiful.  Strange, my shave doesn&#x27;t feel any better than shaving with my older shaving heads.  Somewhat disappointed.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and product is exactly as advertised. I recommend that you check on the Norelco website first to determine the proper replacement heads for your Norelco shaver. The heads are supposed to be new and what I received appaered to be new...but the box they came in was so beat up and broken it did give me some doubts.</li>
    <li> I contemplated getting the genuine HQ4 heads(which were hard to find and $10 more than these HQ56 heads) but I&#x27;m glad I got these, they work great and look and work just like the heads on my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;My last heads were 10? years old and it was taking me longer(1-2 minutes) to shave. With these new heads I&#x27;m back to my regular &lt;1 minute shave routine. Wish everything was made like my 30+ year old Norelco rechargeable shaver. Sure I&#x27;ve had to replace the NiCads a few times(3 times I think) but it just keeps on ticking. I contemplated getting a new model with the fancy digital counter, LiOn batteries, etc. but after reading the reviews I decided to stick to my old model and just get new heads. I&#x27;m glad I did! My current batteries are probably pushing 10 years old but still lasts 2-3 weeks so I probably won&#x27;t replace them until it gets to under a week between charges.&lt;br /&gt;Again these heads work great in my old shaver and the price on Amazon was cheaper than I payed retail 10 years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 month update, heads still working great!</li>
    <li> Price was right.  So I ordered a couple of spares. My Norelco now gives me a super shave.  It is now just like new for a fraction of the cost it would have been to buy a replacement razor.</li>
    <li> I was looking for HQ5 replacement heads for my Norelco 5842XL and found they were twice as much as other current replacement head and not very easy to find, so I went looking to find if there was a current model that would work.  Using Norelco&#x27;s step by step guide, it pointed me to the HQ8, so I ordered some of those.  They would not work.  The center on the HQ8 is raised up about 3/8\\&quot; and that made them way too tight in my razor so they wouldn&#x27;t rock and they would barely spin.  So I went back to the step by step guide to see what it would recommend if I made a different decision on the last step, which was, is the center green or some other color.  I had chosen green the first time, which my HQ5&#x27;s were, but the HQ8&#x27;s were purple, so I chose another color the second time.  This time it told me to use the HQ56, so I went looking for pictures of the HQ56 and they looked like a match for my HQ5&#x27;s, and they are a perfect match.  Now I can buy the much less expensive HQ56&#x27;s.[[ASIN:B004URZADG Philips Norelco HQ56/2 Reflex Plus and Micro Action Electric Razor Replacement Heads]]</li>
    <li> The months pass and I refuse to believe that the whirling razor blades are deteriorating.  Finally I surrender and look for replacement heads.  These heads are clearly the \\&quot;official\\&quot; replacement blades for my Norelco 6423LC razor - it&#x27;s as if I got a new razor.  The package lists all the applicable razor models.  I&#x27;ve got an AC razor (no batteries) which should last for years, so I have ordered a second set of blades for future replacement.</li>
    <li> I expected it to make my Norelco shave like new. Disappointed. Of course, the shaver is old and possibly doen&#x27;t have enough oomph left.</li>
    <li> My husband finds using these very easy but my husband told me to order another set of blades earlier than the recommended time as the blades were not as effective after a few uses but overall a great product so far my husband has no complaints regarding this tool.</li>
    <li> I believe twenty dollar new rotary blades should be able to cut a beard of 2-3 days Without pulling on whiskers causing irritation etc.</li>
    <li> Great price,  Excellent quality, Giving a smooth cut.</li>
    <li> Only the three shaving heads were in the package - not the top as shown in the advertisement</li>
    <li> The order was filled quickly. I went 2 years on original blades.  I love the shaver and the new blades make it work like new</li>
    <li> It works much better than the original, but rarely pulls a little hair of the beard, is easy to clean. What strikes me is why the head must be removed to load</li>
    <li> Actually the blade replacements are fine ; the problem is the shaver design itself. Poor design but then again this is the entry level unit.</li>
    <li> good buy plus price on product and shipping I would recommend this to anyone. I will use them again when need be</li>
    <li> These replacement blades are much better than the factory installed ones. But it is a good idea to change them out at least once a year depending on how much you use it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in good condition.  It was as represented in the ad description.  We are pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Local drug stores should cary this product.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic disposable razors conversely are not eco-friendly, unless they get recycled.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer these electric types and save money for close dry shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight razors are still required in my case additionally.</li>
    <li> The razor works like new again with these new cutting heads. I can confirm that they are a perfect fit for the Norelco 5814XL, there was some confusion about this in all the different compatibility charts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good because i could give him to my brother and we know about the quality of the product and for sure it&#x27;s so fast in my house.</li>
    <li> This replacement worked perfectly for my husbands razor.  His old blades were catching and pulling, so he didn&#x27;t know if he needed a whole new razor or just the replacement blades.  He&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy too!</li>
    <li> I ordered these replacement shaver heads not knowing for sure if they would work properly in my older corded shaver.  They fit perfectly and for the past two months have worked just fine.  Good replacement and a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It fit well and is keeping my razer going after 15 years. Easy to replace and cuts very close. I hope it will last for another 15 years.</li>
    <li> These were for my 88 year old father-in-law that&#x27;s loves his Norelco razor. He changes the blades every year but they are expensive everywhere but here. He was happy I could get him a supply. Note that you are not getting the whole head, just the three replace inserts which are the only things that wear out.</li>
    <li> great cut I am told and the order is on standby every 3 months or so.  reasonable and saves time</li>
    <li> Fits shaver perfectly, shaves nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s product description, as of the writing of this review, says this &amp;#34;Replaces philips norelco hq55 shaver heads.&amp;#34; Despite their aversion to the capitalization of proper nouns, I assume they are talking about the Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads, which is what I had been using up until Amazon seemingly stopped carrying them.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product I wish I had purchased them sooner</li>
    <li> My original heads did a great job but finally neded to be replaced and these are original equipment and also do Great Job</li>
    <li> These are replacements for the HQ56 razor, and they also work in the HQ55.  They&#x27;re about the same as the blades that came with the original razor.</li>
    <li> The replacement parts worked well! I&#x27;ll order them again the next time I need to replace them!</li>
    <li> I knew that my old blades were dull but not until installing these new ones did I realize what I had been missing.  I had gone for almost 3 years on the original set.  That was a mistake.  Somehow I missed the manufacturers recommendation of changing them once a year.  By the way, they are quite easy to change - a far cry from the Norelco hand-me-down that I took with me to Air Force basic training in 1959!</li>
    <li> I love the Norelco 710 RL shaver that I bought at a yard sale because it is light, works well, and simply plugs into an outlet (no fussing with a charger).  Knowing that I wanted to keep it a long time, I did some research of the web and found that Norelco Hq56/52 replacement heads should work with my old shaver. The replacement blades I purchased from Amazon work geat! They do just as well as the originals I had in the shaver.  Since both sets of blades seem to work well, I suppose I didn&#x27;t really need replacement blades now, but I am happy that these worked as advertised so that I will have another set of heads when I need them.</li>
    <li> got dull really fast!</li>
    <li> Electric razor heads are one of those things you never think about until you realize your razor is chopping and pulling your beard.  Dropping these in is quick and easy, and makes your razor new again.  Get some annually!</li>
    <li> :-( I put in my model code for the razor and this poped up as one of the options and it don&#x27;t fit my razor and it costs money to send it back so ya :-(</li>
    <li> Bought for my spouse as he does not like the battery operated type products.  He was delighted and it cut just like a new one.</li>
    <li> These are the OEM replacement blades, and they work well, but I don&#x27;t see how they last a year.  I don&#x27;t have a super-rough beard, nor do I even have facial hair where most guys do - not much in the way of sideburns - but this last set isn&#x27;t shaving me that well, and I haven&#x27;t even had them 6 months.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for, a replacement for the old blades. Arrived quickly and with little packaging.</li>
    <li> Original product as promised. Works fine and restores the shave. Would order again and recommend this for refreshing your razor.</li>
    <li> The new blades made a great difference in the closeness of the shave. I will have to remember to change blades more often.</li>
    <li> These genuine Norelco replacement heads restored my Norelco back to like-new performance.  Installation was quick and easy.  I&#x27;m getting good, close shaves again.</li>
    <li> cheaper than a new shaver</li>
    <li> Returned my shaver to like new performance.  As others said it took a ten minute shave back down to two minutes.</li>
    <li> On time delivery and as described</li>
    <li> These put new life into a older razor. I looked at current prices of Norelco 6900 series razors. Wow! They are double plus from my purchase a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt; These are the &amp;quot;lift and cut&amp;quot; style blade. Work perfect for me. 5 min. install and ready to go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time, price was good, Perfect.</li>
    <li> Not sure it is as good as the one that came with to razor.  I was really impressed with the initial razor cutting but this replacement package seemed to be of a lesser quality</li>
    <li> Good replacement heads for a good price.</li>
    <li> The shave is excellent. The bades cut clean and short. In addition, they last 12 to 15 months of constant use. Well Done?</li>
    <li> they are the right size for my razor.</li>
    <li> great item.  exactly as described</li>
    <li> I was worried that these replacement blades wouldn&#x27;t fit my beloved and well worn old razor.  But they do.  Easy to change out and my razor is like new.  I bought two sets to get free shipping.  So I probably will have sharp blades for the rest of my life.  I wish more products were like this.</li>
    <li> seems to work fine and better price than orignal from norelco,i easier to purchase this way, i use this about 2 times a week</li>
    <li> Does this replacement head work with \\&quot;Philips Norelco 1150X/40 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor\\&quot;? I want to buy a replacement head ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for answering!</li>
    <li> My razor is 10 years old; I bought these, slipped them right in, and they cut like a champ.  Thank you, Norelco, for not making me &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; every three years.</li>
    <li> My husband was looking for this item to give more life to his razor. He didn&#x27;t have to buy it in a store ... if he could find one with this product ...it is really great to have it on time and as ordered without leaving home</li>
    <li> These blades fit my old 905RX precisely and so far work quite well. It had probably been 10 years since I last replaced them, so I was expecting to see (feel?) an improvement, and I did. (I had a full beard until about a year and a half ago, so I was only using it for trimming my neck and just above the beard. That&#x27;s probably why I got so much mileage out of the old ones.)</li>
    <li> Received correct item</li>
    <li> the person loved it he couldnt find it for a gread price as you had it for  i gave it as a gift.</li>
    <li> perform exceptionally well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my electric razor for several years now and have never changed the blades until now.  What a difference!  It&#x27;s like I have a brand new razor now.  I use it every other day to shave my head and it takes me much less time to shave now that I have new sharp blades.  Installation is super easy.</li>
    <li> The product is fine.  After all, it&#x27;s Norelco&#x27;s own.  But in the 6 months since I bought it, every time I  go to &#x27;Your Account&#x27;, there is a flag to the left saying &#x27;But It Again&#x27;.  I find this so obnoxious and irritating that I&#x27;ve resolved never to buy it again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> These blades were a life saver for an old razor.  They fit, they work, they save me having to buy a new razor.  They were easy to order and I received just what I needed.</li>
    <li> What can I say - they are Norelco Replacement Heads - work fine. However the biggest feature is the price - i shopped around and you can not find this low price anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the quality is there with a Norelco product and the low price here - buy it here!</li>
    <li> Exact Mfg. product, Fast shipping, Rec&#x27;d Product undamaged,Great Price when ordering through  Amazon.  New Norelco  shaving heads really make a differance in getting a close &amp; comfort shave !</li>
    <li> The replacement caps work out absolutely fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement heads with a coupon and the price was really good. Its good but not perfect because it doesn&#x27;t fit perfect on my model. If you compare it the one you get with your new razor, I will always prefer that. No other complaints to say...</li>
    <li> Seem nicer than the original ones I had worn out, should make a few months of shaving.</li>
    <li> Made my razor just like new again</li>
    <li> very happy with product and service</li>
    <li> Sent me the wrong product(a beard trimmer). Finally straightened out but  blades fit older model I have and not newer one. Could use blade guard but not blade itself. Just too much of a hassle. In the future I will just buy a new shaver every few years.</li>
    <li> The new blades where as dull as my old blades</li>
    <li> bought  these for my brother in  law great price, he really likes them.</li>
    <li> The blades came as advertised.  Since they were sealed in their original containers, I could see that they hadn&#x27;t been used.</li>
    <li> Fine..just as expected</li>
    <li> Great replacement blades.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy full head but unfortunately it was only little heads inside.&lt;br /&gt;At the photo is different thing and inside different.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my Electric Razor.</li>
    <li> work fine, good value</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re razor blades... it is hard to get excited. Shipping was fine.</li>
    <li> Great price and delivery.</li>
    <li> Renewed my old machine...</li>
    <li> I chose a 5 star rating because my Dad&#x27;s razor is 20 years old and these heads fit and work as if he has a new razor,he was hesitant in buying these since the original model number was no longer available. The comparison chart was absolutely accurate. A week later I bought the same for my husbands old razor and it works like new.</li>
    <li> They were just what I was looking for.  It put my shaver back into like new condition.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> good price and very fine blades,i do not have the words to describe the quality of the product,now the razor and battery you sent me  some  time ago make the norelco as a new one</li>
    <li> Supposedly we have to change razor-heads every 6 months. However, my first one lasted about 8. Just take care of your razors, clean them, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> These work great for a replacement to the HQ55.  No complaints, original product works perfect. My husband has not complained at all since buying these and replacing the old heads.  I would buy again!</li>
    <li> good so far! I hope to use the razor for another year.</li>
    <li> I should have gotten these earlier....it&#x27;s been a fewwww years.  Fits my HQ55+ and alot less expensive than the original HQ55+ blades</li>
    <li> My old blades got to the point of pulling the hairs out of my face. I have had my Norelco shaver for 15+ years and once I installed the new blades it was like a brand new shaver. What a deal! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Perfect match for a 25+ year old razor!!</li>
    <li> Just a fine example of how shopping online can save lots of wasted steps. I found it here after trying numerous stores. My husband&#x27;s shaver is good for another go-round!</li>
    <li> After a trip I found I bent my heads such that one wouldn&#x27;t spin.  This new replacement, well over due anyway, fixed the problem.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor - he has been nicking himself using disposable razors &amp; was so glad to get this for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised</li>
    <li> I have an older razor and it took a lot of reading to find a compatible head for it.  These are doing fine with my razor.</li>
    <li> They work ok, but don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp as when it was new.</li>
    <li> was unsure of fitment worked out fine exact fit, shipped fast, new in box, should by another before becomes extinct.</li>
    <li> Goopg product. Still using.</li>
    <li> 5-5-2013. Adding a new shaver head (Philips Norelco HQ56 Reflex Plus and Micro Action Electric Razor Replacement Heads), along with cleaning shaving debris from inside the unit and applying Super Lube Synthetic Grease with Syncolon Multi Purpose Lubricant (3 oz tube by Loctite) grease to the rotating pivots and gears on the head mechanism aand replacing the NiCad batteries with the Tenergy AA 2.4V 1000mAh NiCd Flat Top Rechargeable Battery Pack for Norelco electric shaver that are amost a perfect fit for the Norelco 835RX, fully restored this shaver to life; almost like new.  The circuit board solder terminals have a smaller slot for the Positve Terminal battery lead and required removal of 1/16&amp;#34; from the width of the terminal lead to fit (a small pair of scissors worked well to trim it). Otherwise, it a perfect fit and seems to work well.  I can&#x27;t remember how many years I have had the 835RX, but it&#x27;s probably 15+ (my best guess) as I have now replaced the NiCad batteries  and shaving heads twice.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It does what I expect it to do. It doesn&#x27;t shave my beard as close as I wish it would. But for the price, it&#x27;s fine,&amp;#34; says husband who uses the product.</li>
    <li> Shaves like new again.</li>
    <li> My husband really is glad to have these replacement heads</li>
    <li> As discribed.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> My husband owns the Norelco Reflex Plus 6 (6863XL), which says it needed the HQ 55+ blades (which he hasn&#x27;t changed in years!) I bought these (HQ56), and they fit perfectly. A smooth shave finally! I&#x27;ve got to get him to replace them more often; it&#x27;s a world of difference.</li>
    <li> Good service from Philips/Norelco. Bought as extras for my son&#x27;s shaver. Bought this product before with excellent results.</li>
    <li> Just as Phillips recommends, this part must be changed every year and the razor would just work as good as always</li>
    <li> Say I hadn&#x27;t changed my razor heads in my Rotatract razor for a couple of years and I was about to switch to the other foil shape- but what a dramatic improvement- do switch heads every year as Norelco advises!</li>
    <li> Work great!  Hubby happy!</li>
    <li> These blades are sufficient at cutting, and depending at how often you use them may last you for a while. This is my second set in approximately 2 years.</li>
    <li> This were replacement units for a two year old shaver.  They work fine.</li>
    <li> Pleased with the performance of these new  blades.  I think they are better than what came with the razor.</li>
    <li> Blade work good for few days.</li>
    <li> As good as the blades that came originally with my Philips Norelco electrical shaver.</li>
    <li> Good replacement heads.</li>
    <li> A real difference is experienced with the new blades</li>
    <li> Very nice i iwll buy it again.</li>
    <li> The first electric razor for my son.</li>
    <li> excellent performance.  arrived quickly</li>
    <li> excellent product recommend</li>
    <li> Quality as usual from Philips Norelco; prompt delivery once again as well.</li>
    <li> Big difference when replacing older rotary blades. Works great and easy to replace.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like having a new razor</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t change these every year, but I do find a sharp blade helps a lot when my beard is a bit longer than usual. If you shave every day it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference. Local price for this item is 1.5 to 2x what Amazon was selling it for - even with international shipping!</li>
    <li> I replace them regularly</li>
    <li> These are OEM blades. They are 3 separate heads that come in a Philips Norelco box. The box says they are compatible with 31DB,6423,6613,6843,6853,6863,69--series and AT6--series. They are identical to those in my 6970 series shaver. My old blades were used for 5 years and were dull - the new blades are sharp.The first shave was rough,the second better and the third was very good . I got 2 boxes which should last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Put them In my 25 year old or more  shaver and it works like new.&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say.</li>
    <li> Is this one can fit Norelco 6945XL?</li>
    <li> My fiance has had his razor for 6+ years, and never replaced the blades.  He didn&#x27;t know he had to! We recently bought the replacements (he was about to buy a whole new razor!) because they were starting to cause a lot of irritation.  Now, there&#x27;s no irritation and it&#x27;s a really smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Fits the unit and cuts the beard.</li>
    <li> This made the electric razor new again, like the day I bought it!  Highly recommend this for those whose blades have gotten a bit dull!</li>
    <li> nice sharp blades, nothing like a new shaved face and these blades do the job every time, the razor is reasonable too!</li>
    <li> It worked quickly and easily and made my shaver work like new. If your shaver is missing spots and you have to go over the same area many times,this is the perfict solution. You have to retrain yourself not to press your face so hard. If your shaver is working anything like mine was you will be so glad you bought these new blades.</li>
    <li> Works well and time will tell if it is a good buy or not</li>
    <li> Bought for a hospital stay. I am not an electric razor user  but found this to be a good partime substitute for the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well woth the affordable price,</li>
    <li> I used to buy the entire replacement head (costing much more $).  This box contains 3 individual razor heads and works great!</li>
    <li> This arrived on time and in good condition.  I really needed replacement blades for my razor.  So I ordered them on line.  They were just what I needed.  I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace HQ 5 heads for a 15 year old 5885XL. The HQ 5 heads are impossible to find at any cost.Prior years I was able to buy through Amazon for around $28.00 These HQ56 heads fit &amp; work fine even though my razor is not listed as compatable. Cost on these was arounf $18.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement, fair price, excellent delivery.</li>
    <li> The razor may be 19 years old, but you can&#x27;t tell with these new blades. Right product for the right price.</li>
    <li> They fit my shaver as advertised, and do a nice job of shaving.  I would have given them 5 start, but my life is pretty much the same as before I got these.</li>
    <li> Ah, a close shave again!  I waited too long to find new blades since HQ55 Plus was not readily available.  What convinced me that this would fit was going to the official web site and finding that, without asking about the type of razor for which it was intended, they recommended this product as a replacement for the blade that is supposed to go with my razor.</li>
    <li> These really didn&#x27;t seem very sharp,  I was actually a bit disappointed.  Generally with new blades there is a night and day difference, but the new set I ordered didn&#x27;t seem to preform that great.  Had to go over the beard many times to get a decent shave. Better than the old ones they replaced, but not by a whole lot.</li>
