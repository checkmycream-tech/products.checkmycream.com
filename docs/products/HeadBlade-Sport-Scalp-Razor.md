### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am happy to report that It has lived up to all the hype!</li>
      <li>Great idea and concept!  </li>
      <li>It is the best way to shave your dome.</li>
      <li>This razor is the perfect way to shave your head.</li>
      <li>Very nice product.</li>
      <li>This thing is seriously amazing.</li>
      <li>The headblade is amazing.</li>
      <li>Hope it works as designed will know after Christmas I am sure.</li>
      <li>I found many people recommending the head blade razor.</li>
      <li>The Gillette Fusion seems to do the trick with much more ease.</li>
      <li>Got for my boyfriend and he was fairly satisfied with it</li>
      <li>The recipient always shaved their head with a normal razor.saw many nicks and cuts and asked why, SO I saw this here on amazon and decided for my Brother maybe this would help stop so many cuts when he shaved his head.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was good enough for me that he likes and uses it</li>
      <li>This is the first time I shaved my head so before doing so, I researched what was the right tool for the job.</li>
      <li>I had no issues the first two shaves...</li>
      <li>Love this thing, and I found that my local grocery store sells replacement blades.</li>
      <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t understand why some reviewers are saying they cut their scalp using this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been smooth sailing so far.</li>
      <li>No enough blades for a clean and crisp shave!</li>
      <li>And it costs about as much as a mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>About as much as a mach3.</li>
      <li>The razor works much better when the blades are sharp and new.</li>
      <li>If you are considering sporting the dome look, this is definitely the right choice to achieve it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update after I replace the blade on the new razor.</li>
      <li>they say don&#x27;t put any pressure on it, but you don&#x27;t really put much pressure on a regular mach 3 either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the idea of the razor but the blade is completely ineffective.  </li>
      <li>The seller however sent an old version, not the one pictured here.</li>
      <li>Everything is great, only complain I have is that the pushing instead of pulling motion makes it difficult to get the area above your ears without the razor itself getting int the way.</li>
      <li>I just got a new one at my local grocery store.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Three, its really small and cool to use.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that it&#x27;s kind of hard to find blades other than through HeadBlade.</li>
      <li>Not nearly as handy as I originally thought it would be.</li>

    <li> This is the first time I shaved my head so before doing so, I researched what was the right tool for the job. I found many people recommending the head blade razor. I am happy to report that It has lived up to all the hype! If you are considering sporting the dome look, this is definitely the right choice to achieve it. No cuts, nicks are battle scars. It&#x27;s been smooth sailing so far.</li>
    <li> Great idea and concept!  No enough blades for a clean and crisp shave!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift.The recipient always shaved their head with a normal razor.saw many nicks and cuts and asked why, SO I saw this here on amazon and decided for my Brother maybe this would help stop so many cuts when he shaved his head. Hope it works as designed will know after Christmas I am sure.</li>
    <li> Totally revolutionized the way I shave my head. Easier. Faster. Smoother. This thing is seriously amazing. The only downside is that it&#x27;s kind of hard to find blades other than through HeadBlade.</li>
    <li> ONCE I got the knack of positioning the scalp razor on my head it became easier to use. The razor works much better when the blades are sharp and new.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as handy as I originally thought it would be. The Gillette Fusion seems to do the trick with much more ease.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Head Blade for years. It is the best way to shave your dome. If you have big hands get the Sport with the black finger ring. It is flexible.</li>
    <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t understand why some reviewers are saying they cut their scalp using this. Its not really that difficult to use people! Use this the same way you would use a mach 3, put the thing on your head and move. I had no issues the first two shaves... they say don&#x27;t put any pressure on it, but you don&#x27;t really put much pressure on a regular mach 3 either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it seems designed to shave against the grain. I made fewer passes using this, against the grain, then I do on a regular razor... like a mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three, its really small and cool to use. There&#x27;s a loop to put on your finger like a ring. Love this thing, and I found that my local grocery store sells replacement blades. And it costs about as much as a mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easier to use than a mach3. Quicker shave than a mach3. About as much as a mach3. Why are you still using a mach3 to shave your head?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Razor tore a hinge when I went to remove the blade. Little mad about how sensitive it is. Taking two stars off, the razor lasted three shaves. I just got a new one at my local grocery store. At this point, I DO NOT SUGGEST you buy this razor due to the difficulty in replacing the blade. I&#x27;ll update after I replace the blade on the new razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is the perfect way to shave your head. I don&#x27;t think I would shave my head if I didn&#x27;t have this.</li>
    <li> The headblade is amazing. Been using this for years. The seller however sent an old version, not the one pictured here. I got a solid yellow one which I had before and lasted for years. I wanted the one pictured with the black handle.</li>
    <li> To small I have big hands just need to get used to it.</li>
    <li> Will never buy one again. It do not work.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Will buy from again.</li>
    <li> Got for my boyfriend and he was fairly satisfied with it</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son. He told me that he likes it, but still &amp;#34;needs to get used to it&amp;#34;. What he means by that I didn&#x27;t ask.&lt;br /&gt;It was good enough for me that he likes and uses it</li>
    <li> I like the idea of the razor but the blade is completely ineffective.  Perhaps I just received a defective blade.</li>
