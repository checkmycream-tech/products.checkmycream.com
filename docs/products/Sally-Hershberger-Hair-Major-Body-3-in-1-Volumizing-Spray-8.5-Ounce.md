### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>LOVE IT!!!!</li>
      <li>Excellent hair spray.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff!!!</li>
      <li>Not as great as shown on TV, but</li>
      <li>great product but not too fond of the scent.</li>
      <li>Great product for the price.</li>
      <li>I use it between shampooing and it makes my hair look great.</li>
      <li>I took a chance &amp; ordered the Sally Hershburger Caffeine spray as I had read good reviews for it.  </li>
      <li>This product is truly amazing.</li>
      <li>I highly suggest that you try this wonderful spray.</li>
      <li>If you have fine, silky hair that slips out of barrettes and can&#x27;t hold a curl more than five minutes after you&#x27;ve walked out the door, this may be what you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>It smells wonderful (which is a big factor for me).  </li>
      <li>Love the Sally Hershberger Hair Volumizing Spray.  </li>
      <li>But it does give more fullness, so</li>
      <li>Rather, it is more of a style refresher.</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>Using this product has allowed me to extend the style for 3 or even 4 days and most people can&#x27;t tell that I haven&#x27;t washed or re-styled it.</li>
      <li>This stuff is magic.  </li>
      <li>This was a total impulse purchase -- but one of the best I&#x27;ve ever made.  </li>
      <li>the hairspray combined with the dry wash formula is the perfect combination.  </li>
      <li>If you enjoy fruity/sweet scents in your bath and hair products, you may love it.</li>
      <li>If you have a strong sense of smell, you might not like it.</li>
      <li>Sprayed LIGHTLY (seriously, do not overdo this) at the roots, this is a good volumizer.</li>
      <li>At the end of the day, my hair still brushes out soft, full and beautiful.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly and holds so well that I even use it when I am able to shampoo my hair just so I can benefit from the volume-enhancing formula.  </li>
      <li>cheap but</li>
      <li>It gives fine flat silky hair that kinda-dirty texture and a good bit of lift.</li>
      <li>Nothing special at all.  </li>
      <li>Love this product really does what it says it will.</li>
      <li>Unpleasantly sweet cloying smell.</li>
      <li>Really good volume and dry shampoo in one</li>
      <li>This works pretty well, but it really smells strong.  </li>
      <li>Good for a little oomph in your hair!</li>
      <li>It just makes it more dry.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay, tends to leave my hair dry.  </li>
      <li>Stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>This spray really works wonders for my hair.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much and it does exacly what it says.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Use too much and your hair will feel filthy/greasy.</li>
      <li>This product only kept my hair full for an hour, tops.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products, many of them much more expensive, and nothing else even comes close.</li>
      <li>Would recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I waited a few weeks to review because I wanted to be absolutely sure, but now I can definitively say that I have found my holy grail hair product.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the lovely volume that I get.</li>
      <li>Not only does the product refresh my morning after hair, but it definitely adds volume (my hair is very fine, but long and plentiful) -</li>
      <li>After I curl my hair and brush it out into soft waves, I spray it all over with the Caffeine hair spray.</li>
      <li>give you a decent look for an extra day or two when you hair need to be washed.</li>
      <li>The softness and body hold through multiple combings as well as walking in wind and high humidity.</li>
      <li>I love to shampoo every day and know that it&#x27;s not good for my hair.</li>
      <li>A few quick sprays and some fluffing with my fingers gives instant big volume which lasts &amp; lasts.</li>
      <li>Was really disappointed as I had heard a great review by a magazine editor.  </li>
      <li>I have thin, fine hair that drive me to drink...</li>
      <li>Great for days when oops, I overconditioned, or want Big Stupid Sixties Hair.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> For anyone who has gotten up late (those OH !#%@ mornings), this is the product for you!  Not only does the product refresh my morning after hair, but it definitely adds volume (my hair is very fine, but long and plentiful) - the hairspray combined with the dry wash formula is the perfect combination.  I have not had a problem with flaking, dusty particles or building up from this product - which is a true bonus.  It dries quickly and holds so well that I even use it when I am able to shampoo my hair just so I can benefit from the volume-enhancing formula.  I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay, tends to leave my hair dry.  But it does give more fullness, so I guess it&#x27;s a trade.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t give the volume I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still not sure about this product. I have short, thick hair and needed fullness and height. This product only kept my hair full for an hour, tops.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well, but it really smells strong.  I sprayed it in the bathroom and it lingered for 20 minutes afterwards.  If you have a strong sense of smell, you might not like it.</li>
    <li> Love this product really does what it says it will.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair but hate to load it with sticky hair sprays or mousse to get some volume &amp; hold. I took a chance &amp; ordered the Sally Hershburger Caffeine spray as I had read good reviews for it.  This spray really works wonders for my hair. A few quick sprays and some fluffing with my fingers gives instant big volume which lasts &amp; lasts. My hair feels a little dry but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the lovely volume that I get. Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> This was a total impulse purchase -- but one of the best I&#x27;ve ever made.  This stuff is magic.  I&#x27;m blessed with lots of hair and it&#x27;s very thick.  But it&#x27;s also super-smooth and has almost no texture.  Now that I&#x27;m wearing it long, it tends to be rather heavy and a bit droopy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this product.  It&#x27;s billed as texturizer, hairspray and dry shampoo all in one and it lives up to that.  Just a little bit sprayed through your hair gives it so much texture, without making it feel weighed down or dirty.  It gives you that \\&quot;day after\\&quot; hair feel that lets you do something with your hair.  After only having this for about a week, I&#x27;m already calling it a holy grail product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not cheap but a little goes a long way.  I can see this lasting for quite some time.  Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I waited a few weeks to review because I wanted to be absolutely sure, but now I can definitively say that I have found my holy grail hair product. This product is truly amazing. After I curl my hair and brush it out into soft waves, I spray it all over with the Caffeine hair spray. The softness and body hold through multiple combings as well as walking in wind and high humidity. At the end of the day, my hair still brushes out soft, full and beautiful. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products, many of them much more expensive, and nothing else even comes close. If you have fine, silky hair that slips out of barrettes and can&#x27;t hold a curl more than five minutes after you&#x27;ve walked out the door, this may be what you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
    <li> Sprayed LIGHTLY (seriously, do not overdo this) at the roots, this is a good volumizer. It gives fine flat silky hair that kinda-dirty texture and a good bit of lift. Great for days when oops, I overconditioned, or want Big Stupid Sixties Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides : Unpleasantly sweet cloying smell. Use too much and your hair will feel filthy/greasy. I can NOT see how this could possibly work as &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; - it seems to just add gunk so that your hair texture feels less slick, as opposed to an oil-absorbing product that you apply and then brush to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention the smell? OMG the smell is *rank*. If you enjoy fruity/sweet scents in your bath and hair products, you may love it. As a fan of wood/leather/herbal scents who uses Aveda hair stuff almost exclusively, this is SO not my jam. However : volume. I&#x27;ll use it occasionally, but it&#x27;s definitely not going to be a daily thing for me.</li>
    <li> Just another dry spray. Nothing special at all.  Was really disappointed as I had heard a great review by a magazine editor.  Rats.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! I highly suggest that you try this wonderful spray.</li>
    <li> Normal results -not great</li>
    <li> This spray works quite well on flat hair that has lost it&#x27;s volume. Spray on and brush through then style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;Will give you a decent look for an extra day or two when you hair need to be washed.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair that drive me to drink...no volume and slides all over the place! This stuff solves the problem. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Stuff really works.  Keeps your hair dry without losing ANY hold.  You can also style and touch after spraying without that dreaded &amp;#34;wet streak&amp;#34; look.  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Really good volume and dry shampoo in one</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair spray.  You don&#x27;t need much and it does exacly what it says.&lt;br /&gt;It can be combed through, but it does provide hold and body.</li>
    <li> It is not really a hairspray for hold. It just makes it more dry.</li>
    <li> My head of hair became to taught and if I rubbed it against my bed at night my hair fell out, also it is very difficult to wash out and pulls out your hair, not recommended for people that do not have extra strands of hair to spare.</li>
    <li> great product but not too fond of the scent.</li>
    <li> Does the job without being sticky.  Holds the hair!  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This product did not perform as I expected</li>
    <li> Love the Sally Hershberger Hair Volumizing Spray.  It smells wonderful (which is a big factor for me).  Would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Was not impressed at all with this product and definitely would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this really helps give me volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Good for a little oomph in your hair!</li>
    <li> This is the second Sally Hershberger product I have bought - and not cheap- that promised volume. It is a dud as was the last one. It did absolutely nothing to my hair except leave it limp and lifeless.My hair actually looked worse after I used it. I will never buy one of her products again. Absolutely a waste of money. Does not deliver.</li>
    <li> Not as great as shown on TV, but okay.  Definitely not a hair spray.</li>
    <li> I love this product but  think it suffers from an identity crisis. It&#x27;s certainly not a hair spray for holding a style, nor does it seem to be a dry shampoo  Rather, it is more of a style refresher. I use it between shampooing and it makes my hair look great. I love to shampoo every day and know that it&#x27;s not good for my hair. Using this product has allowed me to extend the style for 3 or even 4 days and most people can&#x27;t tell that I haven&#x27;t washed or re-styled it.</li>
