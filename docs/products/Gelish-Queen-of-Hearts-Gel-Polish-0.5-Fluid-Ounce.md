      <li>beautiful sexy red.  </li>
      <li>These polishes make my nails SUPER strong too which is also a BONUS!</li>

      <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Great for the price, will order again in the future.</li>
      <li>I have told all my friends about it and some of them have already started using it with the same great results that I have gotten.  </li>
      <li>I constantly get compliments on how great my nails look.  </li>
      <li>My daughter gave me the UV lamp for my birthday and told me that a friend who had experimented with other gel polishes said that Harmony Gelish was the easiest and best polish to use and she was right.</li>
      <li>Love it so much!</li>
      <li>It had more shimmer than I expected, but I loved it.</li>
      <li>Loved it my items  arrived at the same time in 2 days.</li>
      <li>Thanks to customer images I was able to make an informed purchase.</li>
      <li>But it seems like a good cool tone red.</li>
      <li>Great color, and true to other reviews</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty color</li>
      <li>I finally tried it out and absolutely love the color!</li>
      <li>This is a true red and has a stunning shimmer to it.</li>
      <li>All of their colors go on smoothly and come off fairly easily when you soak them properly with acetone.  </li>
      <li>See the customer images for true color, it is much sparklier than the swatch</li>
      <li>But for me as this is my first time I have to say it was worth it</li>
      <li>Thanks to other reviewers&#x27; comments, I was able to make a more educated choice.  </li>
      <li>so I would suggest doubling time to prevent red color bleeding onto top coat brush.</li>
      <li>If you are into pretty nails</li>
      <li>It is really pretty</li>
      <li>It is dry immediately with a UV dryer, and it&#x27;s easy to remove!</li>
      <li>I love this color because it is vibrant and has a pretty solid color in just one coat.  </li>
      <li>Even if you have thin or brittle nails, this polish will make them look beautiful.  </li>
      <li>A true red color with just the right amount of shimmer.</li>
      <li>Not Really a Waitress\\&quot; - by far my all time favorite OPI color - this is so damn close!</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful true red with little in the way of orange or blue undertones.  </li>
      <li>and I always wanted my nails to look great but did not have the time to constantly paint my nails every few days.  </li>
      <li>Color was exactly as expected, a bright glittery red without a hint of orange or purple.  </li>
      <li>It is so much easier to use than I thought it might be.</li>
      <li>It is very shimmery but not glittery.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>In My Santa Suit, and this is really close.</li>
      <li>It is a perfect red (Deep, not primary) with a shimmer.</li>
      <li>This is a nice shade of red similar to what it looks like on screen.</li>
      <li>This is a nice red color, as everyone says, the color doesn&#x27;t match the computer screen, but this provides coverage with 2 coats, if I had to describe I would say a traditional or true red-</li>
      <li>It actually lasts too, unlike most regular polishes!  </li>
      <li>I will try a better one and report back in the future.</li>
      <li>With the other Gelish supplies this gel polish lasted easily two weeks</li>
      <li>I bought the minis at Sally&#x27;s, but have since ordered new colors online.</li>
      <li>I love the Gelish system, but this (just like all other highly frosted red gel polishes I&#x27;ve used) wrinkles upon curing.</li>
      <li>It is very similar to one of my favorite colors from OPI called \\&quot;Really not a waitress\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>and like I had them professionally done!  </li>
      <li>Deep, rich red!</li>
      <li>I went through a few reds before I found this, if you are looking for a gorgeous deep red color</li>
      <li>Like many other Gelish swatches, the color was no where similar to what the actual color appears.</li>
      <li>I purchased this particular color based on another reviewer&#x27;s comment that it was very similar to OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;I&#x27;m</li>
      <li>Queen of Hearts is a very pretty red, though a little darker than I normally wear.</li>
      <li>If you are unable to get your toenails shellacked as well, a good matching color is OPI &amp;#34;Affair in Red Square&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Queen of Hearts is a very classy yet playful red color.</li>

<li> Like the other Gelish Polishes I&#x27;ve used, this color goes on differently that what I see on the monitor.  </li>
<li> No issues whatsoever with application or dry time.</li>
<li> if you&#x27;re not careful it gets on your cuticles and pools a little on the ends.  </li>
<li> so it isn&#x27;t a dead, flat looking red.</li>
<li> Would definitely recommend, and I don&#x27;t usually like red!</li>
<li> I was wary of buying it online because I didn&#x27;t want to end up with anything even mildly magenta.</li>
<li> Gelish needs careful application to prevent shrinkage, but his one is on the easiest side.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Their polish is always very nice but, the color was not as shown.  It definitely has more of an orangy base to it; not rosy as shown.  It&#x27;s a very pretty color but I never wear anything that has orange tones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a gel polish in the perfect metallic red - and this hits the mark. I purchased this particular color based on another reviewer&#x27;s comment that it was very similar to OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;I&#x27;m Not Really a Waitress\\&quot; - by far my all time favorite OPI color - this is so damn close! Love it!</li>
    <li> Gelish is all I use now on my fingernails, and I love this color!  Gelish polish makes my nails look shiny and like I had them professionally done!  It actually lasts too, unlike most regular polishes!  Even if you have thin or brittle nails, this polish will make them look beautiful.  It is dry immediately with a UV dryer, and it&#x27;s easy to remove!</li>
    <li> I love the Gelish system, but this (just like all other highly frosted red gel polishes I&#x27;ve used) wrinkles upon curing. I&#x27;ve tried everything I know to stop it, but to no avail. Very frustrating :  I had to discontinue it&#x27;s use on clients.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like the color by OPI&#x27;s I&#x27;m not really a waitress.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, easy application and good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Some Gelish needs careful application to prevent shrinkage, but his one is on the easiest side. Gossipgirl is actually the easiest to apply.</li>
    <li> Finding the right color read can be so hard, especially with Gelish.  The color on the label (especially with the minis) looks nothing like the actual color. I was wary of buying it online because I didn&#x27;t want to end up with anything even mildly magenta. Thanks to other reviewers&#x27; comments, I was able to make a more educated choice.  When I received the color, I was delighted it was exactly what I was hoping for. Queen of Hearts is a very classy yet playful red color. It is very shimmery but not glittery. It is very similar to one of my favorite colors from OPI called \\&quot;Really not a waitress\\&quot;.  Best.red.ever.</li>
    <li> beautiful sexy red.  It&#x27;s actually a little lighter than the picture.  But it seems like a good cool tone red.</li>
    <li> Great color, and true to other reviews, it has more of a sparkle too it.  With the other Gelish supplies this gel polish lasted easily two weeks</li>
    <li> I love this color because it is vibrant and has a pretty solid color in just one coat.  It is a solid red.  Also, Gelish makes great nail polish.  All of their colors go on smoothly and come off fairly easily when you soak them properly with acetone.  Also, when you take them off with the acetone (instead of peeling them), it leaves little to no damage on your nail.  I own over 25 colors by Gelish.  I am very impressed by their product.</li>
    <li> This color is sort of tacky looking.  Maroon + sparkles...I was not a fan.</li>
    <li> I went through a few reds before I found this, if you are looking for a gorgeous deep red color this is it! It isn&#x27;t quite as dark as the picture and has some shimmer to it. It looks amazing with the matte top it off too :)</li>
    <li> Like the other Gelish Polishes I&#x27;ve used, this color goes on differently that what I see on the monitor.  It is a beautiful true red with little in the way of orange or blue undertones.  It is a favorite of my teenage daughter and her friends, yet is very stylish for a more sophisticated look.  It is truly a beautiful color.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something similar to OPIs In My Santa Suit, and this is really close. This is a true red and has a stunning shimmer to it. No issues whatsoever with application or dry time.</li>
    <li> My favorite color has always been the darker reds. But I did 2 thin coats and it was a little lighter then this picture. But for me as this is my first time I have to say it was worth it and I&#x27;ll be ordering more. Love it...</li>
    <li> Make sure to purchase the entire HARMONY GELISH product line to make this polish perfect.  I have been using these polishes now for 3 months and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Make sure to follow the YOU TUBE video on HOW TO APPLY HARMONY GELISH POLISH and you cannot go wrong!  I constantly get compliments on how great my nails look.  I do not use tips, just as a personal preference.  I have told all my friends about it and some of them have already started using it with the same great results that I have gotten.  I am a full time mom, and I own my own business and I always wanted my nails to look great but did not have the time to constantly paint my nails every few days.  These polishes make my nails SUPER strong too which is also a BONUS! Just remember to take your time while applying it, and follow the step by step YOU TUBE video and you cannot go wrong!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Gelish colors.  It is a deep red color with some sparkle to it.  If you are unable to get your toenails shellacked as well, a good matching color is OPI &amp;#34;Affair in Red Square&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This color is so rich! This is the perfect red. Love it so much!</li>
    <li> I love this gel polish! It is so much easier to use than I thought it might be. My daughter gave me the UV lamp for my birthday and told me that a friend who had experimented with other gel polishes said that Harmony Gelish was the easiest and best polish to use and she was right. It goes on evenly and stays on for a good 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve bought 4 different colors and they are all great! Queen of Hearts is a very pretty red, though a little darker than I normally wear. It has a nice shine and a hint of gold in it so it isn&#x27;t a dead, flat looking red. It is really pretty and I have gotten lots of compliments on it. I did my daughter&#x27;s nails in this color and she too received lots of compliments. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Gelish products and I would recommend this color if you are looking for a very pretty red.</li>
    <li> This is a nice red color, as everyone says, the color doesn&#x27;t match the computer screen, but this provides coverage with 2 coats, if I had to describe I would say a traditional or true red- with a nice shine.</li>
    <li> A true red color with just the right amount of shimmer. Beautiful. Would definitely recommend, and I don&#x27;t usually like red!</li>
    <li> Color was exactly as expected, a bright glittery red without a hint of orange or purple.  See the customer images for true color, it is much sparklier than the swatch shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very active and I have been known to destroy a manicure in a few hours- this lasts for weeks with only a few nicks.  The only downside is the same as all gel polishes- if you&#x27;re not careful it gets on your cuticles and pools a little on the ends.  I&#x27;ve also found the cure time is significantly more than advertised- BUT- this may be due to my inexpensive led lamp, so I will try a better one and report back in the future.</li>
    <li> Love the Gelish Gel Polishes and the Queen of Hearts is just beautiful.  Its my #1 favorite, just a beautiful shade of red.</li>
    <li> This nail polish does remind me the OPI I am not a waitress color. Just put it on my nails, will see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the beautiful color.  If you are into pretty nails this color is for you, Yes!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a red to wear on holidays such as Christmas and valentines day. I finally tried it out and absolutely love the color! I did notice it took a bit longer to cure under LED so I would suggest doubling time to prevent red color bleeding onto top coat brush.</li>
    <li> Great for the price, will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using the Gelish Polish system and I Love It!! I bought the minis at Sally&#x27;s, but have since ordered new colors online. I added the pic because the color descriptions and swatches don&#x27;t do this color justice.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shade of red similar to what it looks like on screen. It had more shimmer than I expected, but I loved it. Darker than the bright reds, but not maroon like some.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Deep, rich red! Goes on smooth. Harmony Gelish is my fav shellac to use! Stays on forvever!</li>
    <li> Like many other Gelish swatches, the color was no where similar to what the actual color appears. Thanks to customer images I was able to make an informed purchase. Love Amazon! It is a perfect red (Deep, not primary) with a shimmer.</li>
    <li> Loved it my items  arrived at the same time in 2 days. I am very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> We tried this wonderful color with both types of curing lights and neither of them cured it to hardness satisfactorily.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this color by itself or topped off with Ambiance, which adds a glittery shimmer.  A blue red tone. Thanks</li>
