<ol>
      <li>Perfect color for me.</li>
      <li>Absorbs oils wonderfully, will get again.</li>
      <li>Great powder, truly translucent!</li>
      <li>Great touch up powder, I keep it in my purse.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
      <li>I LIKE THE NICE PLASTIC CASE WITH THE MIRROR.  </li>
      <li>the Transluscent Fair is perfect for me; before this, I couldn&#x27;t find a shade in other brands that matched my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I love that it comes with a mirror.</li>
      <li>It gives my face a ghostly shine and make any wrinkles look more pronounced.  </li>
      <li>, you can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing powder, yet the skin looks better (glowly)...</li>
      <li>Fantastic product, Physicians Formula!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started using a makeup pad to apply this because it&#x27;s just easier for me, but I&#x27;m sure the brush works well too.</li>
      <li>The coverage is sheer but somehow your skin looks flawless when you have it on.</li>
      <li>I am very fair and it totally made me not feel or look paler  😄</li>
      <li>The powder is light and just gives my face a more even look.  </li>
      <li>, so I believe this is a good way to start if you are also new to this type of makeup :)</li>
      <li>, it has a strong smell, maybe because it&#x27;s made out of goat hair.. ??.</li>
      <li>😃 Goes great under almost any upper-to middle grade bronzer.</li>
      <li>This product has been good to my skin which is described by doctor as sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>The coverage is perfect for what I was looking for, very light, I only do one coat, I don&#x27;t have major problems with my skin</li>
      <li>I was excited to get this product (Translucent Light Organics)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup regularly, so this is a good product for me.  </li>
      <li>Very light powder - not heavy at all.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is great too - it comes with a little brush AND a mirror.</li>
      <li>Love the handy little brush and the color matched my skin.</li>
      <li>First, let me say -</li>
      <li>Any company that puts out a rancid product should be willing to provide a refund, or if another rancid product is sent to the consumer, they should be held accountable for that defective product.</li>
      <li>It is light and and looks natural all day.  </li>
      <li>and I was able to use it as a very light and natural bronzer to add a little color to my face.</li>
      <li>First of all, I&#x27;m really fair-skinned  and</li>
      <li>I really like having the lighter shade infused into the product.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used it much since it made me break out all over my forehead.</li>
      <li>though, I really like it.</li>
      <li>I came packaged really well.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Even this lightest color was a little darker than my skin, which ended up being fine</li>
      <li>I also have pretty oily skin, and if halfway though the day I notice my face looking oily, I just use my brush (not the one it comes with, that brush is very bad) and it completely mattifies my face and makes it look great!</li>
      <li>, I never, ever used powder before I bought this (24yrs old)</li>
      <li>WITH MY SENSITIVE KIN.</li>
      <li>I only give it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t give much coverage.</li>
      <li>I higly recommend this for people who have sensitive skin or problem skin.</li>
      <li>it is a natural product though</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last long, but it&#x27;s summer and very hot and humid.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s barely noticeable, but I still like to use this powder on my neck sometimes and it evens everything out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice powder, but it smells weird.</li>
      <li>I got the lightest color there is, translucent light, because I have the very pale skin!</li>
      <li>The ingredients are natural - so many other brands are full of the chemicals we&#x27;ve learned can be irritating or even worse, carcinogenic over time.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m very pale and have had a hard time finding something light enough for my complexion.</li>
<li> I apply it very lightly with a Kabuki brush and no matter how little I apply, my face instantly looks shiny and WEIRD.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure how to put</li>
<li> I was not satisfied with the product because it smelled rancid</li>
<li> It is hard to apply and it cakes on your skin.  </li>

<li> too thick, smells bad.  </li>
<li> ;? It makes your face look weird and shiny!</li>
<li> I absolutely hate this powder.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love that it comes with a mirror. I didn&#x27;t like the applicator, it has a strong smell, maybe because it&#x27;s made out of goat hair.. ??. Anyhow I just use a different brush. The coverage is perfect for what I was looking for, very light, I only do one coat, I don&#x27;t have major problems with my skin, you can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing powder, yet the skin looks better (glowly)... I&#x27;m not sure how to put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I never, ever used powder before I bought this (24yrs old), so I believe this is a good way to start if you are also new to this type of makeup :)</li>
    <li> Great powder, truly translucent!😃 Goes great under almost any upper-to middle grade bronzer. I am very fair and it totally made me not feel or look paler  😄</li>
    <li> First, let me say - I hate wearing much make-up and have never really gotten used to wearing powder because I always felt like my pores were being smothered.  This, however is now my &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;.  Very light powder - not heavy at all.  I really like having the lighter shade infused into the product.  It adds a brightening to your skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate this powder. I apply it very lightly with a Kabuki brush and no matter how little I apply, my face instantly looks shiny and WEIRD. I&#x27;ve had people ask me &amp;#34;What&#x27;s on your nose? It&#x27;s white.....is it lotion you forgot to rub in&amp;#34;? It makes your face look weird and shiny! I&#x27;ve never had this issue with any other powder before, and it smells bad!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product (Translucent Light Organics) but after opening it I found that it smelled rancid.  There was no date on the product so I do not know if it had exceeded its shelf-life.  I contacted CosmeticRX - Amazon Marketplace to let them know I was not satisfied with the product because it smelled rancid and I did not want to put it on my face.  I asked for a refund but they said by policy to get a refund they needed the product back, but they couldn&#x27;t accept back the product once it is open because it would be thrown away before it ever reaches their office.  They said they could send me another like-item with the understanding that if I was not happy with its smell I would not hold them responsible.  I told them that with those terms I could not accept another like-item so that is why I am giving them one star.  Any company that puts out a rancid product should be willing to provide a refund, or if another rancid product is sent to the consumer, they should be held accountable for that defective product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice powder, but it smells weird. Haven&#x27;t used it much since it made me break out all over my forehead.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It&#x27;s nonirritating. My only complaint is the packaging. I appreciate the company trying to consider the environment, but the lid tears off after a short usage time. If you tape it as soon as you receive it , there is no problem.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT CAME IN A TIMELY MANNER ALONG WITH OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS I ORDERED.  I LIKE THE NICE PLASTIC CASE WITH THE MIRROR.  THE PRODUCT WORKS WELL WITH MY SENSITIVE KIN.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like how it makes me look period.  It gives my face a ghostly shine and make any wrinkles look more pronounced.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
    <li> I prefer other natural brands to this one.</li>
    <li> For the price I would give it five stars. Doesn&#x27;t last long, but it&#x27;s summer and very hot and humid. Great touch up powder, I keep it in my purse. Love the handy little brush and the color matched my skin.</li>
    <li> I have never like any powder until I tried this.  I have been using it for years.  I have very sensitive skin.  It is light and and looks natural all day.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.  Amazon is the only place I can find it now in my shade.</li>
    <li> I recieved this today! I came packaged really well. Only bad thing about it was it was too light for my skin tone, but I will continue to used it, because I can put a darker color over it. Over all I like this product, besides the smell, it kinda smells like chalk to me.</li>
    <li> I hope Physicians Formula never stops making this product, because it&#x27;s the only one I will use. First of all, I&#x27;m really fair-skinned  and the Transluscent Fair is perfect for me; before this, I couldn&#x27;t find a shade in other brands that matched my skin tone. The ingredients are natural - so many other brands are full of the chemicals we&#x27;ve learned can be irritating or even worse, carcinogenic over time. The coverage is sheer but somehow your skin looks flawless when you have it on. The packaging is great too - it comes with a little brush AND a mirror. I&#x27;ve started using a makeup pad to apply this because it&#x27;s just easier for me, but I&#x27;m sure the brush works well too. Fantastic product, Physicians Formula!</li>
    <li> Perfect color for me. I&#x27;m very pale and have had a hard time finding something light enough for my complexion. Absorbs oils wonderfully, will get again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup regularly, so this is a good product for me.  The powder is light and just gives my face a more even look.  I like that it comes with a place to keep the brush as well as a little mirror.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> too thick, smells bad.  It is hard to apply and it cakes on your skin.  it is a natural product though</li>
    <li> This product has been good to my skin which is described by doctor as sensitive skin.  Since using this product I did not experience any acne, breakage of skin or pimples.  I higly recommend this for people who have sensitive skin or problem skin.</li>
    <li> I like this powder a lot. I got the lightest color there is, translucent light, because I have the very pale skin! Even this lightest color was a little darker than my skin, which ended up being fine and I was able to use it as a very light and natural bronzer to add a little color to my face. Also, sometimes since I am so pale, my foundation will be a smidge darker than my actual skin color, so my face ends up being a tiny bit darker than my neck. It&#x27;s barely noticeable, but I still like to use this powder on my neck sometimes and it evens everything out. I also have pretty oily skin, and if halfway though the day I notice my face looking oily, I just use my brush (not the one it comes with, that brush is very bad) and it completely mattifies my face and makes it look great! I only give it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t give much coverage. Other than that though, I really like it.</li>
