<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this after washing my hair with a curling shampoo.  It reduces frizz a LOT (and that means a lot in this gulf coast humidity!)&lt;br /&gt;I have combo hair (can curl if i don&#x27;t dry it, or goes straight if I blow dry it) and love that I don&#x27;t have to use hair spray or continue trying to scrunch up the curls to make them soft as they dry... this product gives me soft, defined curls without crunch or frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts 2-3 days, even if I wash. Which is great when I want to curl my hair (less use of product, less steps getting ready) but I have to plan on having curly hair for a few days because if I try to blow dry, it makes my hair a bit heavy and just feels weighed down.  You can smell it for 2-3 days too so if you don&#x27;t like the smell - oh well!  I personally think it smells great :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I bought one for my sister to try too.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would do better for my coarse hair. It works really great for one day but the curls have collapsed by the next day. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday so I was looking for something that lasted for a few days.</li>
    <li> I love how light-weight this cream is - not greasy at all. It defrizzes and defines curls/waves and smells soo good (grape).</li>
    <li> I occasionally use this product.  I like that it enhances the curl without making my hair crunchy or greasy looking.  I use it by first combing my hair and towel drying.  I allow the hair to dry naturally for about 15 minutes (or about 1/2 way dry with hair dryer + diffuser).  I flip the hair upside down, apply the product, and really shake up the curls.  I then allow it to dry completely (or dry to completion with diffuser).  Style as needed.  DO NOT brush or comb it once dry.  That&#x27;s just asking for trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes about this product:&lt;br /&gt;1) It smells like Dimetapp&lt;br /&gt;2) You CAN add too much!!!!  I was in a hurry one day and slathered too much on when the hair was too dry.  It became gross and unmanageable.  It&#x27;s best to use too little than not enough.  You DO NOT need to saturate your hair with this.&lt;br /&gt;3)  If you have the impulse to put on too much, try watering it down a little.  When I get down to the last bits in the container, I toss some water in there, give it a good shake, and then add more than what I would normally.  Works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;4)  I have not experienced any issues with it drying out my hair.  Gels tend to dry the crap out of my hair, but this stuff does not.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and it does help my hair into more defined curls. But it leaves SO MUCH buildup in your hair! I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;saturate&amp;#34; my hair with it as the directions suggest and I STILL have excess buildup. If you wash your hair and try to straighten/blow dry the next day, be prepared for your hair to feel greasy and dirty. It takes several days of washing to get my hair feeling clean again. This issue makes it pretty unusable.</li>
    <li> great for curly  hair no frizz defines curl</li>
    <li> This product is a good value and meets my needs as expected.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair that&#x27;s VERY prone to frizz. I bought this hoping it would help define the curls a little better, and more importantly, tame the frizz! I used it daily for over a week in varying amounts, and finally gave up and bought something else today. It defined my curls pretty well, but didn&#x27;t do much for the frizz unless I caked it on, and even small amounts left my hair looking and feeling dirty and gross. A lot of other people have commented on the smell so I&#x27;ll just say that I didn&#x27;t mind it. It&#x27;s a little strong, but it didn&#x27;t bother me. So overall, it&#x27;s ok in small amounts, but just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome price and great shipping. Not Your Mothers&#x27;s Products are the best hair products you can buy.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed by this product - I followed the instructions and let my hair air dry. It was greasy and somewhat frizzy, but not curly.I&#x27;m going to try to use this in different ways to see if it works better, but so far I&#x27;m not super satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have fine, dense, curly hair that curls nicely with some encouragement. This cream gave no texture or curl definition; my hair is just soft. It also smells like grape Laffy Taffy, which I happen to not enjoy. One star for you, Kinky Moves :(</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Makes my frizzy hair show it&#x27;s natural curl.</li>
    <li> I picked some up at target since it was affordable and looked like it had less chemicals than some of the other brands. Smells super good and held the curl all day.  Lots of compliments on my hair.  It can be crunchy if you put too much on.  I put a quarter size amount in my palm and dilute it with some running water and run it thru my still damp hair. It only takes a small amount for my thick long hair.</li>
    <li> Ehh, it&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;m still mastering how much to use. I think it works best when your hair is slightly dryer rather than super wet right after a shower if you&#x27;re trying to get a tame wave (like me) seems to make my hair crunchier than I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> New Favorite Hair Product</li>
    <li> My new favorite hair product. Put it in damp hair and scrunch and you will have easy body all day!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Walmart and gave it a try since it was inexpensive. It has a strong grape scent and made my naturally curly hair crunchy and stiff.  I was looking for something to tame my frizz, but give me soft touchable curls. [[ASIN:B004SU88CU Not Your Mother&#x27;s Kinky Moves Curl Defining Hair Cream, 4 fl oz]]</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that is banana curls and it has crazy volume. I&#x27;ve never really liked to use hair products on my hair when it&#x27;s curly but when I started to dye my hair, I noticed it started getting frizzy. I did a little research and cam across this product and I must admit, it&#x27;s amazing! I will never use another product on my curls other than this.</li>
    <li> I have long (mid back), very thick, frizzy, wavy hair. When my hair is shorter, it could be considered curly, but big curls, not tight ones. However, because it is so long and heavy, the curls are mostly weighted down. When scrunching my hair, my curls barely show up in comparison to the way it used to look. I bought this in hopes of making some of the frizz tame down and make my curls stand out a bit more. I have used it only three times but I can see the difference it makes. I use this only when scrunching my hair. I put about a quarter size amount into my hands, rub my hands together and flip my hair upside down. I do this a couple of times until I feel like I have full coverage (not on my roots). My curls stand out more versus using mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things to note:&lt;br /&gt;1) The product is sticky, and I am not a huge fan of how it feels in my hands, but I just wash my hands when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;2) I do think it has a strong smell, which could either be liked or not. It threw me off the first time I used it but I kind of like it now.&lt;br /&gt;3) the bottle is small and if you have a lot of hair, it empties fast. I doubt I could get more than 10-15 uses out of the bottle, but I do not use it that often.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted some product to help my curls. This does a nice job and I did buy another bottle after the original was used. It has a nice mild grape smell and I do notice the texture of my hair and curls is better when I use this. I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star because although I am very happy with the product and will continue to buy it,  I don&#x27;t feel it is a \\&quot;miracle worker.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, thick, naturally curly hair that when left alone is about three feet wide and frizztastic. This is a great cream for me - my hair doesn&#x27;t get crunchy and I&#x27;ve found that over the course of the day it holds up well. I use about 3 quarter sized blobs and scrunch from the bottom/upside down, and then air dry. The scent can be overwhelming if I use too much, but it is much more pleasant than most of the salon products out there. For the price this is a great product I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
    <li> did not work for me. i have fine wavy/curly hair. i usually apply while my hair is damp, scrunch the product in after warming it up by rubbing my hands together, and let it air dry. then after it&#x27;s completely dry, i&#x27;ll scrunch my hair again to soften it up and give more volume. when i did this using this product, my hair just frizzed right up (which surprised me being this is a lotion product) and i ended up having to wear a hat. i tried this on 3 different occasions and it just never worked for me, unfortunately. and i don&#x27;t care for the grape smell. it smells too much like those candy scented lip glosses for kids.</li>
    <li> It works well, it smells like grape, so why only 3 stars? Because the grape smell only lasts for a little while, they you notice, it kinda smells like fish oil! not good to snuggle with!</li>
    <li> I have semi curly hair and this product works great on it. I put it into my hair while its damp and sleep on it. My curls come out more even, softer, and fuller</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the grape smell in the store, and I bought it.  I had a killer migraine by the end of the day and had to shower to get the scent out of my hair.  I still have the head ache but at least I&#x27;m not going to be sleeping with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so bad that I returned it! It doesn&#x27;t matter to me if it makes my hair nicer. I cannot tolerate the smell and couldnt wait to wash it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved how my hair is thick and naturally curly, but I always had to resort to straightening it because I didn&#x27;t know any other effective way to make it less frizzy. If I brushed the frizz away, the curls ended up looking matted. But with this, it&#x27;s so perfect. The only drawback is that my hair a little tangled and hard to brush through right after I&#x27;ve applied it. Which is worth it if you ask me. Because I end up having shiny curls with minimum effort, other than brushing through it while it&#x27;s still kind of wet. Also I love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I have long, wavy/curly fine but thick hair. I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of curling products, and this is probably the best I&#x27;ve tried. It defines and holds my curls without a lot of excess weight, doesn&#x27;t flake, isn&#x27;t sticky or crunchy or wet-looking. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and will keep buying it!  As for the scent...I don&#x27;t love it, don&#x27;t hate it. Would I love it more if it smelled like Aveda? Sure. But for the price, it&#x27;s a factor I&#x27;m willing to overlook.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to use when I wave my hair, and it didn&#x27;t help at all. When you put it in your hair it just makes it feel really heavy and look greasy. Also, it&#x27;s supposed to be \\&quot;jasmine\\&quot; scented or something but it smells gross :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless products and this one work great. I use a dab of anti-frizz serum, then the Kinky Moves and it smooths my hair without making it feel loaded. The scent is strong, but once it&#x27;s in your hair, it&#x27;s subtle.</li>
    <li> The results are amazing. My hair curls incredibly with this product. Unfortunately, the smell is AWFUL. Grapes and Jazmin are NOT a good combination. When your hair is wet, it reacts weird to the product and it smells so bad. It can seriously be off-putting. The good news is, you *could* get used to it (i did), but it took me a good few months of usage.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of excellent reviews on this product, so I was really looking forward to trying it. I showered and ran a generous amount through my hair, scrunched it, and then twisted it into a bun. For reference, I have straight hair that curls a tiny bit at the bottom and gets super frizzy in humidity. I was hoping that this would enhance those curls and define that frizz into curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t mind the smell though it was sweeter and more \\&quot;artificial grape\\&quot; than I anticipated, it wasn&#x27;t too unpleasant. The texture while my hair was drying was slimy and I didn&#x27;t enjoy that at all. When it dried, there was absolutely no difference in my hair. It had zero curl, no volume, just a little bit of oily residue where the hair stuck together. It wasn&#x27;t stiff, but it wasn&#x27;t anything else either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it a few more times on wet and dry hair, up and down, scrunching and twisting and just letting it drip dry with the exact same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s not for my hair type.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like heaven! I love how moisterizing it is for my dry, curly hair. That being said, you have to be very careful not to apply too much or else it looks greasy and weighs hair down and makes it flat. I have repurchased this product.</li>
    <li> It seemed to do well on my curly hair giving my curls definition and not leaving it stiff. The big HOWEVER is the product smells like grape cough syrup and the smell lingers. I will be not be using this product anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because it smells like bubble gum.  I&#x27;m 59, I have very curly hair and I like the way it holds the curl, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like a teenager.</li>
    <li> I have coarse, thick, wavy hair and while I&#x27;d rather not spend an hour straightening it every morning, I often felt a need to do that for work. It just didn&#x27;t feel professional to have hair crazy with flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products to smooth it out, but they either felt like too strong of a hold, made my hair greasy or crunchy, or didn&#x27;t do much to solve my problem. This stuff is perfect. The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the smell, but it gets masked a bit by my hair conditioner smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 16 and I have 3b/3c type curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from Wal-Mart and I hated it! It had a wonderful smell, I must admit. My hair didn&#x27;t frizz...but it didn&#x27;t dry either. It made my hair dry very unevenly and, for the majority of the day, most of my hair didn&#x27;t even dry. It left my hair heavy and my curls had a weird texture for a couple days. It smells great but works terribly. Perhaps I used it wrong (even though it seems fool-proof), but I really didn&#x27;t like this product. I&#x27;m going to give it another try in the future though.</li>
    <li> Just makes my hair stiff, it doesn&#x27;t do a thing for defining curls.  It smells nice, but I was expecting way more for the money.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work. All I did was apply a little bit throughout my hair (don&#x27;t apply a lot) and I blowed dried it upside down and holy cow my hair was super curled. I have naturally curly hair and I&#x27;ve been having a hard time keeping the curls to stay curly and this product does a great job of doing that.</li>
    <li> The best curl cream I&#x27;ve ever tried hands down. I see people giving reviews that say they love the smell or hate the smell - well I have no idea what&#x27;s wrong with some people&#x27;s sniffers but this stuff smells AMAZING. It also gave me pretty waves that stayed put all day and no frizz!</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible, rancid grape! I thought I could deal with the smell but it just got worse! I have naturally curly/wavy hair and this product made it almost straight! Followed the directions and my hair was far from curly! It flattened what curls I did have! Poor product with horrible smell I do not suggest it, save your money!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to help my natural wave come out, and had heard good things about this product.  It smells wonderful! I have tried applying it to both damp/wet hair and dry and using a diffuser to dry it, and it leaves my hair with the crunchy/stiff feeling that you would get from using gel or something.  Was hoping it would leave hair soft, but no luck.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this if you don&#x27;t want a fragrant product. Especially don&#x27;t buy it if you don&#x27;t like grape scents. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of grape flavored or scented anything (aside from the miraculously delicious fruit that is the actual grape), so using this on my damp hair in the morning is kind of a struggle for me. I have flash backs of having to take cough syrup as a kid. The scent seems to dissipate as my hair air-dries, though.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried applying and then blow drying, but I can attest to the air drying method. The result is a lot of defined tiny spiral curls. I didn&#x27;t realize I had such tiny spiral curls, or that they could be so defined by air drying alone. But this stuff does it! So I think I like it because it is effective in creating that particular style. But for me, the grape smell is yucky so I took it down a star. Honestly, it could be a scent that is unavoidable due to the fact that the product touts the use of grapeseed oil. If it&#x27;s and added fragrance though, ugh. Tone it down.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m considering trying out NYM&#x27;s other curly hair products intended for larger, looser curls to see how my hair reacts to those products. Maybe their scent will be less flashback-invoking for me, haha!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! At first, I didn&#x27;t see the point of using it because blow drying after applying this product left my hair unruly and stringy. Also, the scent is very very strong. However, I went to bed for a couple of hours and woke up to bouncy waves! My hair isn&#x27;t usually this full. Rather, my hair is usually thin, dry, and composed of straight/wavy-ish hair. Thankfully, with this product, I can now achieve a more put-together hairdo of bouncy waves in little time!</li>
    <li> i already have curly hair but i bought it because i wanted some texture to all of my hair. it is a very chea product it does work on my curly hair and it smells nice</li>
    <li> When its hot and humid this hair cream is the best for keeping your curls from getting frizzy.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells bad, I&#x27;m sad... I really don&#x27;t like it.... not what I expected, wish it was better but is not</li>
    <li> for curly hair, this cream is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. Works great in high humidity areas as well as drier climates.</li>
    <li> I truly hope they never stop making this hair product because I could not live without it. I do not like to blow dry or put any heat on my hair, after I wash my hair and comb through it I put about a quarter size amount in my hair and scrunch it while wet then go to bed and wake up with crazy curls! No product has ever done that before! I think it is the grape seed extract, who knows either way it rocks!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Not Your Mother&#x27;s Dry Shampoo so I figured I&#x27;d give this Curl Defining Cream a try as well. I have wavy to curly hair and was surprised when the directions said to saturate your hair with the product root to tip. I did as instructed and while it did produce good curls that were not frizzy, I can tell my hair is extremely weighted down from the root-it looks flat, as opposed the full look of curls I usually get with other products. Also, and most importantly, it&#x27;s been 4 days and 3 showers since I put it in my hair and it&#x27;s not completely out!! My hair has a waxy texture when it is wet. I feel like I have permanent leave-in conditioner in my hair and it&#x27;s weighing it down. I do not like how my hair is feeling now and I can&#x27;t understand how 3 washes hasn&#x27;t gotten it out yet!! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you have exceptionally unruly curls that need definition and you don&#x27;t anticipate blow drying your hair straight soon after going curly.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good. It helps keep my long curls defined all day without being crispy, but a little goes a LONG way.  I have thick, curly hair well past my shoulders and if I use more than a pea sized amount my curls look crispy.  Plus using this everyday leads to some build up so I skip it once or twice a week.  At this rate I expect this one tube will last the rest of my life, which is fine because used sparingly it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my 3B curly hair. Not sticky, keeps the humidity/frizz out, reasonably priced, and smells sweet &amp; fantastic. I use it with the sea salt spray and can&#x27;t get enough of these Not Your Mothers products. Have gone through my first bottle and I&#x27;m ready to buy more.</li>
    <li> This is toooooo heavy for my fine thin old hair.  It is very very sticky to use and is much crunchier that it claims.  This product would probably be ok for someone with gorgeous hair.  I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to properly use this, but no matter how much I use it leaves my hair the next day stringy and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing again, but would like to try &amp;#34;Not your Mother&#x27;s&amp;#34; other products.</li>
    <li> Heard rave reviews about this product on fashion blogs and such and it semi pretty well lived up to my expectation. My hair is wavy and on the fair/thin side so I am able to curl or straighten it without a problem on most days. It definitely adds more defined curl to my hair without making it frizzy looking throughout the day. This hair cream smells somewhat of smarties/candy which wasn&#x27;t too appealing to me but hey, it works. The only big complaint I have is that it is pretty greasy. I guess I should have expected that from a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; curl defining product but the fact still remains it is greasy.</li>
    <li> a curley girls best friend... HEAVEN... so good... ive waited 29 yeras for you!!!</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy frizzy hair..and I&#x27;ve never found a product that worked without making my hair crunchy or grimy. I didn&#x27;t completely saturate my hair in it..but I did use about a half-dollar amount for my longer than shoulder length hair..and then scrunched and air dried. It worked much better than I expected! Also..I bought this at Wal-Mart and it wasn&#x27;t even $5.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo, conditioner and curl cream. What a waste of money. Not only does it smell awful, but it didn&#x27;t do 1 thing it claimed it would on the tube. I made my hair limp, frizzy and gave it a mess of knots and tangles. I ripped hair out of my head just trying to get my brush through it. My recommendation? Save your money and buy something else.</li>
    <li> I perm my hair to get light spiral curls. My hair is normally straight, fine and thin, and the sides are white-grey while the back is healthy and has a little grey in it. The back keeps its curl definition but the sides tend to frizz up after the perm because of being grey. If I air dry my hair, the sides look good until I either pick it or a little time passes.  It won&#x27;t take long before it gets fuzzy rather than curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything to keep the fuzzy frizz under control from oils to heavy conditioners. All that did was give me oily frizz!  I saw this product the other day so gave it a try. It isn&#x27;t expensive so was worth a shot. All I can say is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; because the sides now have the same curl definition as the back. Even if I pick it out a bit, it keeps the curl and looks healthy and shiny. I dampened the sides (not much) and rubbed about a nickel size blob on my hands then on the sides (in other words, my hair wasn&#x27;t wet). I had enough left over that I ran it through the back, too. My hair looks amazing - all curl, no frizz. And the curls are not &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; After my hair dries I lightly run my fingers through my curls go fluff them out and I&#x27;m good to go.  I love this stuff! So much I came here and ordered 4 more to keep on hand. I never want to run out!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and had read a review about this product saying it was so good for curly hair making ur curls full and bouncy but it seemed to make my hair frizzy and dull</li>
    <li> Not sticky which is great and smooths nicely but no real hold or defintion and the smell is very overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great for naturally curly hair and reasonably priced priced.  It nice you can order it on line since you can&#x27;t always find it in the stores</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fantastic and it&#x27;s a great texturizer!&lt;br /&gt;A very important product when I&#x27;m getting ready now.</li>
    <li> I was wary of getting this after reading the mixed reviews but decided to try it. It smdlls great to me but made my hair feel greasy. It did however define my curls. I&#x27;m on the fence with this product snd once it is gone won&#x27;t be getting it again. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought for my curly hair, the smell is nice on its own but once i have rubbed in between my hands and fingers it smells really really bad. As far as how the product works, Iv had better. I wont repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> So....I was cursed with naturally curly hair. Not the good kind, but the frizzy messy kind. I picked up a bottle of Kinky Moves. I have to admit, my curls have never looked more gorgeous. However, it smells horrendous. It&#x27;s like I cut off a teenaged boys foot, wrapped it in grape bubblegum, and applied your product with it. To top it off, it leaves this nasty film on my hair. I used your product today, and when I showered this evening, it didn&#x27;t come out. When I wash my hair, I super lather it. It always comes out squeaky clean. I&#x27;ve been using Kinky Moves daily since I bought it, which was a few days ago, so I hadn&#x27;t noticed the state it leaves my hair in until I decided to blow dry it straight tonight. I had a difficult time getting the brush through it while I was blowing it out. After I finished drying it, I flipped my hair over and it was pretty much plastered to my head. My hair looks horrible. It usually looks so soft and touchable, but right now I wouldn&#x27;t dare touch it. If it wasn&#x27;t midnight, I&#x27;d totally wash it again. This was my first bottle of NYM, and I wasn&#x27;t pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Does nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it really brings out the girls in my long hair, without the frizz with minimum effort on my part.  I put it on right out of the shower and let my hair air dry.  You don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I originally bought it for my son who is 2 and has amazing corkscrew curls. I didn&#x27;t like the crunchy gel look, especially on such a little guy but his maine needed some serious taming! I found this and it was perfect. It stays in place all day even through some naps.  After using it on him for a bit, I tried it on myself and was so impressed. I never liked the wave/curl in my hair until I tried this! You can use too much though, then it gets crunchy but no problem if used sparingly. Unfortunately, I am having a hard time finding it since I relocated...</li>
    <li> This product works. I have wavy hair which I can easily dry to be completely straight even without a brush or iron. If I want curls I cannot achieve them without a special product for that. When I decide to be curly, this cream makes my curls soft and filled with shape and moisture. I have used plenty of curl definers for my essentially non curly hair, and this one is one of the best. It also gives good volume to my rather thin hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about two weeks now. I&#x27;ve tried everything from &amp;#34;saturating my locks&amp;#34; (as it directs me to on the bottle), to a dime sized amount. No matter how much, or little, I put in my hair, it always turns out greasy and weighed down. It destroys my curls and makes my hair look like I haven&#x27;t showered in weeks.</li>
    <li> The product makes my hair look great BUT the grape smell is overwhelming at first, similar to the scent of dimetap medicine. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it daily. Seems tough to wash out.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, wavy hair that takes a curl like a dream, however it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34; on its own without help. Sometimes, when the weather is just right, my hair will get very curly but it&#x27;s temperamental. As such I&#x27;ve been on the look out for a product that would help add some oomph and help define the curls that I know exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very thick and feels almost like white glue. It doesn&#x27;t smell very good either. The instructions say to put a liberal amount into your hair, coating it from root to tip. The first time I tried the product, I used a minimal amount because to use a lot seemed like a lot of product. The first day it felt bigger but didn&#x27;t really do much in terms of helping to define the curls in my hair so I ended up putting my hair into a bun. Later that day though, after I took my hair down, I had LOTS of volume and curl! My hair felt HUGE but was almost impossible to get my fingers though. The next day I had no choice but to wash it (I usually go every other day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good friend of mine has naturally curly hair (corkscrew curls) but has issues with her hair being on the thin, fine side. She used the product and she faired a lot better than me. Her curls were well defined and her head lacked the frizz that usually halos her head. She liked the product a lot but complained about the thick, stickiness factor too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for the product but for me it just doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the product&#x27;s fault though -- I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have thin hair or a hair that&#x27;s more wavy than curly.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good hair product, I&#x27;ve tried many..MANY curly hair products.  I&#x27;ve probably tried hundreds of them.  I like this because it really reduces frizzy A LOT.  I hate frizz because it takes away from the &#x27;wow&#x27; of curls.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair either, but if you put it on too thick (which I guess I did)  it looks like you&#x27;ve gelled your hair.  I put it on at the root and smoothed it down, and I would probably recommend against that.  Start in the middle and shake it out, because at the top of my hair was flattened and not voluptuous.  I would also say, if you use this more than a few times a week, wash your hair with a stripping shampoo because it does feel like it builds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef with this product is the smell.  Maybe I&#x27;m the only one?  But I hate the way it smells, nasty grape-candy and they tried to cover it up with jasmine and it didn&#x27;t work.  It smells...musty and not refreshing like I was hoping for.  I enjoy a lot of different aromas, from light and refreshing, to dark and almost manly.. but this is just a no.  Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t have staying power, so you just need to stick it out for a little while.  I also wish I could find a smaller sample size for sale because this is going to last a long time I bet, longer than I need it to (if that makes sense).  I know they make a sample size!  I just don&#x27;t know where to get it.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this cream for my hair. i have a lot of curly, frizzy hair and this cream can tame it without making it hard. check out the price your grocery store has it, though, since it was a few dollars cheaper than amazon&#x27;s prices.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this curl cream at all.  It did nothing for my curls.  I have wavy hair that with the right product curls and stays well.  This cream made my hair fall flat with slight waves. Not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have long, dry, frizzy, curly hair and wear a ponytail everyday just so I don&#x27;t have to deal with straightening my hair. I saw this product on pinterest and was eager to try it. It&#x27;s affordable, however the bottle is small and with long hair like mine (midway down my back) - I use quite a bit of product each time. I put the cream while my hair is wet and air dry. It does take awhile to dry, but when it does, it looks very natural. My curls are bouncy and very touchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wash  my hair every other day, so at night I twist my hair into a bun or braid it. The next day, it looks even better! It provides just the right amount of moisture, i don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s greasy or heavy on the hair. I also love the fruity smell, it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that this came in a bigger bottle :)</li>
    <li> I like this for my daugher&#x27;s fine, curly hair.  However, it does seem a bit heavy at times.  Next time, we&#x27;ll try a different product, but I might just come back to this one.</li>
    <li> too sticky, and when I tried to use it with another product it gummed up in my hair. When I use it alone it works ok, but is just too heavy</li>
    <li> African American young lady with 3c texture hair and this is amazing. Defines my curls like no other product has. After wetting my hair the curls are there but kind of limp until I apply the not your mother&#x27;s curl definer. Just would like to have access to a bigger bottle in the store. I personally like the smell....it fades away after a few hours. And the defining of my curls lasts alllllllll day and night. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair that frizzes pretty bad without any product. This product makes my hair more curly, without leaving it crunchy or heavy, like gels do. I use it whenever I want to leave my hair in a more natural look. Will absolutely be buying again</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful. I have naturally wavy hair that is also fine and can use a bit of a boost. I bought this thinking it would have a nicer result than the typical salt sprays that dry out your hair and make it look crunchy. It did produce soft waves, however, the smell and the after effect were disgusting. The smell is bad, it smells like grapes gone wrong. The smell did dissipate after a while though. The worst part was the nasty wax-like after effect that it gave my hair. I could tell my hair felt like it had a lot of product built up before I showered so I made sure to was it twice. I got out of the shower and to my dismay after I dried it, it still felt like wax. I could literally mold my hair to make it stand out straight. Maybe I just have strange hair, but the after effect alone ensures that I will never touch this product again. I probably won&#x27;t even touch this brand again after this.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this makes a soft curl with definition. It doesn&#x27;t take much and the curls really last.</li>
    <li> This is the worst curl cream I have ever used, and I have used quite a few. I have naturally curly hair but this product weighed it down and made it feel dirty. It&#x27;s very sticky and heavy. I even used different sized amounts and it didn&#x27;t matter. It smells like crushed flinestones vitamins and not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst still, I had to wash my hair several times to get it out, and it has dried my hair out so badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terribly disappointed in this terrible product.</li>
    <li> very thick curl cream.  I have fine long hair that is very wavy to curly with coaxing.  I did find this a little heavy for my hair, so be careful to start with a small amount and work up to larger portions or you may find this too sticky.  Probably amazing for very thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this. I have a lot of fine wavy hair that tends to get big and fuzzy, especially due to the humidity in hawaii. This gives my waves some shape and weighs it down a little.  The only thing that could make this better (for me) is if it provided a little more separation. Good for use on wet or dry hair. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> Works well just wish it didn&#x27;t have such a strong floral scent</li>
    <li> My hair went from straight to wavy after having kids so I tried a number of products to learn how to style it. I tried this cream as directed (it says to saturate your hair) and hated it. The smell was way too strong and made me sick and my hair was crunchy and greasy looking. I tried it again today but used probably a quarter of the amount I used last time and I love the result.  My waves are soft, smooth, defined and natural looking and the scent is very subtle. I will be using this more regularly now! I also recommend Not Your Mothers Beach Babe spray for more beachy looking waves.  Great company, great products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with Marc Anthony beach wave spray and I&#x27;ve been getting great curls.  I like the smell a lot, but would prefer if it had a little more jasmine to it.  It&#x27;s a little overpoweringly grape smelling.  Which is nice, but overpowers the jasmine oil I put in it.</li>
    <li> NYM Kinky Moves is the best curl defining product I have ever used, hands down. I have searched long and hard for a curl product that will help my curls take shape without leaving them wet-looking and crunchy-feeling. This stuff leaves my hair soft and touchable, with no gunk, crunch, or stickiness left over. My curls form perfectly every time, and the frizz is better, too. NYM&#x27;s Kinky Moves works better on my hair than the entire Aveda curl line.</li>
    <li> First few times I&#x27;ve used it does nothing for me. I may try experimenting with it a little more but I don&#x27;t have high hopes. I have fine, thin wavy hair with more curl in humid weather. This appears to be too heavy for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my curls smooth and not hard.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I have naturally curly hair...not too kinky, and this stuff really boosts the curl! Will be purchasing again and again!</li>
    <li> This works well on my super curly, frizzy hair. I love the grape smell. I just wish it were a bit cheaper because for my hair, I have to use quite a bit of it. My hair is thick and to my shoulder blades. I can use this when my hair is towel dried and scrunch it, allowing it to air dry and it really keeps the frizz away.</li>
    <li> The best part about this shampoo is that it&#x27;s sulfate-free, which is why I bought it in the first place. It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as my conditioner (a different brand - they didn&#x27;t have any of the matching conditioner in-stock), but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to get it through all your hair. I got it at WalMart for $4-something rather than here, so price-wise it&#x27;s not bad either. My hair turns into a man-eating frizz dragon if I let it air-dry, and despite being naturally wavy refuses to hold a curl with any actual shape to it, but this does separate the waves into distinct pieces, something other shampoos fail to do. As for post-curling iron hold, it softens a bit within the first couple hours but stays pretty well after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But onto the negative, and it&#x27;s a big one for me - maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve never used sulfate-free before, but my hair feels DISGUSTING after I wash the conditioner out. My bangs and my roots look like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair at all and the rest of my hair is dry, thick, and weighed down. If I leave it in, my hair gets crunchy, oily, and feels even heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it was only $4, I&#x27;ll try the conditioner meant to go with it and see if that helps, but if not, it&#x27;s onto the next sulfate-free I can find.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Smells wonderful too. I even ordered a bottle for my sister and shipped to her in another state and she can&#x27;t live without it now</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair products I have ever tried on my curly hair. I have an entire collection of products I&#x27;ve bought and only used once. Nothing seems to work like it&#x27;s suppose to on my unruly and unpredictable hair. This hair cream works wonders on my hair every time I use it. Sometimes I put it in and dry my hair and other times I just let it air dry, the outcome is great either way. I&#x27;m going to stop buying questionable products and keep a supply of Not Your Mother&#x27;s Kinky Moves Curl Cream around at all time.</li>
    <li> Unless you have really curly hair .. Don&#x27;t buy.. I have slightly wavy hair and it didn&#x27;t do anything for me :( boo</li>
    <li> Works best with hairdryer. Letting it air dry gave me dreads by the end of the day lol</li>
    <li> I have coarse, thick 2C hair. This product gave me great curls for about 10 minutes. They feel flat and the rest of the day I had huuuuuge scary volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would work well for those who have fine hair or want more volume. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have much hold, so it should probably beer paired with gel.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair cream- I used to buy it at Target but then they stopped carrying it.  I have medium weight, fine, wavy hair.  This does a good job of giving my hair hold and frizz control without making my hair limp.</li>
    <li> In the bad, poppy way! It is a really overpowering grape smell and is very strong - I smell like a pre-teen! The products performance is not worth the stench, and I will be returning this. I mix this with a leave-in conditioner and my hair feels dry yet still crunchy and a little bit greasy. Not sure quite what&#x27;s going on but I definitely disagree with all the raving reviews. I&#x27;m glad I tried it and was able to find out it doesn&#x27;t work for me, but it will definitely be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, my hair is very naturally curly and course. I get a keratin treatment, which is about half grown out, so my hair is half curly/half very wavy. Very dry and frizzy without product.</li>
    <li> The product works, but the smell is a little gross.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell, but like others have mentioned, the heavy waxy feel left after my hair dried drove me nuts. I couldn&#x27;t even put a brush through my hair the next day after two shampoo applications! I was about to offer it to my sister to try, but decided I didn&#x27;t want to subject her to this crap because I love her. I&#x27;m having better luck with a lightweight smoothing cream for frizzies and a spray wax to scrunch with under a diffuser.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t for me. I have thin wavy/curly hair and it definitely weighed it down. Would work great for those with thicker hair and more defined curls. BTW I use their beach wave stuff for my hair and it is brilliant for adding body and defining my curls. I always get compliments on my crazy hair when I use it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in hopes of taming my usually frizzed out curly hair. I wanted something that would keep them in line but without the usual sticky, crusty mess that gel and hairspray leaves me with. I usually wash my hair at night and put a bit of this in (not too much!) while it air dries. I blow it dry to get the rest of the dampness out and then put it in a hair tie on top of my head. When I wake up in the morning, I have awesome curl and hardly any frizz. It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of this product is both the smell and the remnants it leaves behind. I don&#x27;t wear my hair curly every single day so after I wash it and try to straighten my hair, I can oftentimes still feel the product in my hair - even after multiple washes. It just doesn&#x27;t come out all that well. That and the smell isn&#x27;t that great - a bit too strong in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I use this product on a daily basis, helps tame the curls, without feeling it in your hair or being greasy.  I also use their shampoo and conditioner and the frizz control.  It&#x27;s the best product I have ever found for my hair and I am 53 years old.  It&#x27;s about time!  Wal mart neighborhood market used to carry the shampoo and conditioner but stopped, they were the cheapest on it.  I use quite a bit of the shampoo, because even though my hair is only shoulder length, it is very thick.  Wish wal mart would bring it back.....</li>
    <li> I have 2b wavy/curly baby fine hair. This stiff works great! My hair is shoulder length with layers. I &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; my hair straight out of the shower and let the tshirt or microfiber hair wrap absorb excess water while I get dressed. Then I take that off, flip my head over, and put about a quarter size dollop of this product on my palm. I rub my hands together, then just scrunch all through my hair making sure to get it all over. Then I use my hair dryer with diffuser to dry, scrunching as I go. When I&#x27;m about 80% dry, I flip my head back over, tuck and tame curls where needed, then spray with finishing spray. My hair holds the curls and waves all day without being stiff or crunchy. The product feels sticky in your hands while you&#x27;re applying it, but it dries soft. This stuff works better than the Redken Curvaceous Curls that I bought from the salon and paid twice as much for!  Not crazy about the scent, but it&#x27;s not terrible and it doesn&#x27;t bother me once it&#x27;s dry. I recommend it and I&#x27;ll be using this from now on!</li>
    <li> I have a very slight natural wave, and thin hair that doesn&#x27;t hold style easily, and I used this product with a diffuser and then a styling iron and my hair looked like it had natural beachy waves. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll know more in the summer, but like it so far.</li>
    <li> I get this in stores a lot cheaper and love it. My hair is fine wavy, frizzy, i just put on from the middle down</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair look great. It&#x27;s not crunchy, and it keeps my curls from flattening out or getting frizzy, all without making my hair look oily. But it barely deserves three stars, due to it&#x27;s smell. I read the other reviews complaining about the smell and thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not that sensitive to smells, should be fine!&amp;#34; I was totally wrong. This isn&#x27;t a subtle thing you can ignore... this product has an intense stomach turning odor of grape jolly ranchers that doesn&#x27;t fade at all throughout the day. It&#x27;s the smell that just keeps on going and going. If they ever make a scentless version I&#x27;d be all over it, but I will never buy this candy-grape scented product again.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  I&#x27;ve tried probably 10 different hair creams and this is my favorite so far.  The smell is stronger than I am used to, but it holds my curls all day and works really well.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow this is the best product i have ever used on my blonde dry locks just brings life back into my hair so many people ask me what product i use it really is amazing !!!!</li>
