    <li> I use this on the first signs of acne and it usually clears it up before it becomes a embarrassing problem.</li>
    <li> Best pimple medicine of all time. Received very quickly and packaged great. Put it on pimple at night again in the morning and pimple is gone. *only apply on clean skin!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to others to use for blemishes. I also recommend using honey for blemishes that is local natural honey. The honey will help with the scarring. The Proactiv product drys up the blemish.</li>
    <li> Proactive is a very good product for teenagers who tend to break out more with blemishes. This product is great for isolating treatment just where you want it.</li>
    <li> This product is use as needed when those emergency breakout occur ..the one here or there unexpected ones.  This product truly is effective  and I have tried several ones..THIS IS A KEEPER!...Thank you, Jodi</li>

    <li> Just what I expected. The packaging was perfect and so is the product. I appreciate this.I am extremely satisfied.Thank you:)</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this product and she has gone through many products (and I don&#x27;t just mean acne treatment but I mean she tries EVERYTHING) over the years but she has always and consistently bought this for those pesky, want-them-gone-tomorrow, pimples.

    <li> It just made my face really dry and it didnt do anything for the blemishes..I&#x27;m really disappointed bc i thought it would be my saving grace.Hopefully it worked for someone else</li>
    <li> I bought these for the daughter of a friend and she loves it</li>
    <li> WIFE LOVED THE ITEM, GREAT PRODUCT, A+++</li>
    <li> After getting all gum ho about this product by their TV commercials, I was unhappy with the performance.  I gave a tube to my daughter and she gave it a similar review.  Too bad, I was hopping for something at least a little better.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, very happy the product is as expected.  Buying in bulk definitely saves time and money.  I would love to do most of my shopping on Amazon and skip the stores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream 2 weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve seen the best result so far. I wish I&#x27;d knew about this soon than purchasing Murad that did nothing for my acne.Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got scammed by Guthy-Renker by signing up for Proactiv shipments, but I love their products.  I am thankful that they are all available on Amazon.  The spot treatment is better than plain old 6% benzoyl peroxide because there are moisturizing ingredients in it that keep your skin from getting irritated and peeling. I love this and use it on both large and small areas to keep cystic acne at bay.</li>
    <li> Purchased this a week ago and so far its working great. Seeing some progress on my face and my back. Highly recommend this product.</li>
