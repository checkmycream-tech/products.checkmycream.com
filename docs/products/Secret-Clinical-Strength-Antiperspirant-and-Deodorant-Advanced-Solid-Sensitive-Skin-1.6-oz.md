      <li>I love this one and will be using this product for as long as I can get my hands on it.7-$9 cost to lose if it isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>I love this one and will be using this product for as long as I can get my hands on it.</li>
      <li>This is very good for sensitive skin (does not irritate my skin) and it only works half of the time (while sitting at a desk all day)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>and while I don&#x27;t sweat as much</li>
      <li>I have been on the search for a great deodorant and just did not find it in the secret clinical strength deodorant.  </li>
      <li>you Secret, you have made me a more confident woman</li>
      <li>Most shelves are stocked with other every variety except this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, the listed price per ounce of $2.12 is incorrect on this particular product.</li>
      <li>I am a very active/athletic 21 yr old woman</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who don&#x27;t necessarily want their armpits smelling like flowers or fresh linens.</li>
      <li>The deodorant itself is fine though, just more expensive than advertised.</li>
      <li>They haven&#x27;t cured my overly-sweaty nature, but they&#x27;ve helped reduce the dampness to a level I can live with.</li>
      <li>During normal daily activities like running errands or walking around campus on a hot day I barely broke a sweat.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, so I use this antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>Those of us with allergies/migraines really appreciate it when a product both is unscented and actually works.</li>
      <li>Other deodorants are no longer worth trying.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products with little to say for results, most last less than an hour</li>
      <li>I would highly reccommend trying this one, you&#x27;ve got only the $7-$9 cost to lose if it isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>It lasts much longer than 24 hours, even when I drip in sweat from menopausal events, my underarms are dry and never smelly.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found the sensitive skin version of Secret Clinical Strength.  </li>
      <li>When used according to directions (in other words, applied on clean skin at night and allowed to dry before putting anything on)</li>
      <li>Fewer shirt changes on a daily basis means less laundry and much more confidence being active on my part.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t normally share such personal details</li>
      <li>I consider myself to be a heavy sweater and live in the tropics, and it´s really embarrassing to have sweat stains or an odor</li>
      <li>The soft almost gooey solid is a little icky at first, but once you get the hang of applying it and find the right amount for you</li>

    <li> Best deodorant - strong so it does the job.  But doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.  I don&#x27;t like my deodorant to have a scent, partly because I prefer to add scents to myself in other ways when desired (e.g. perfume), and partly because the smell of deodorant mixing with sweat seems to amplify it.</li>
    <li> This works just fine for 24hr protection against stress sweat and it is fragrance free.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product! Other deodorants are no longer worth trying. In fact, some made the problem worse. I bought the travel size of this thinking I was wasting my money - but it WORKED all day. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Active ingredient is same as active ingredient in regular unscented Secret deodorant, which I can buy for $2.49 for 2.60 oz. versus almost $9.00 for 1.60 oz. Difference is that content of active ingredient is 20% in &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; versus 18% in $2.49 version. Also picture shows quantity of 2, but price is for quantity 1. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I discovered Secret Clinical Strength a couple of years ago, when menopause started bringing heavier perspiration than I was used to. When used according to directions (in other words, applied on clean skin at night and allowed to dry before putting anything on) it is completely effective--hands down the best antiperspirant out there. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, however (never wear perfume) and the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about Secret Clinical Strength is that even the mildest scent, Powder Dry, was a bit bothersome to me. Now that I&#x27;ve found this unscented version, however, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else. It works just as well as the scented variety, and there is absolutely NO smell.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and also sweat a lot and thought this would be a great product but couldn&#x27;t use it for more than a week. I got a horrible itchy rash. The only reason I switched was because the previous deodorant was not controlling my sweating problem.</li>
    <li> It is so lovely when an unscented product actually IS unscented!  Will buy again.  Those of us with allergies/migraines really appreciate it when a product both is unscented and actually works.</li>
    <li> I am a very active/athletic 21 yr old woman and unfortunetly I am cursed with over active sweat glands.  I sweat on cold days, hot days, when Im nervous, when I excercise, and when Im not doing anything.  My sweating has caused me many embarrassing moments, sending me on a search for any antiperspriant that could help bring my underarm wetness under control.      I tried Dove, it smelled nice for an hr or so untill I had sweated all the product away.  I tried Arm&amp;Hammer, Degree, and I even tried some mens brands that worked so-so but the scents were WAY TO STRONG.  After trying a bunch of diffrent brands and finding them lacking in wetness protection or having a overpowering smell I finaly decided to try this product.      YOU MUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!!  I didnt read the directions at first and was disapointed with the results.  After I read the instrustions and applied it at night b4 bed I was FLOORED with the results.  During normal daily activities like running errands or walking around campus on a hot day I barely broke a sweat.  When I increased my activity level I was expecting the usual downpour, what I got was slight dampness and almost NO PIT STAINS.      Most deoderents are flowery or sweet smelling.  I dont want my armpits to be producing any smell at all, nice or not.  This product has the least smell of anything I have tried.  Its not a babypowder smell, its not a \\&quot;hospital\\&quot; smell, it has a barely noticable neutral smell that I can only just smell after excessive excercise.    I will never use another Antiperspriant/Deoderent other than this one.  This product is fabulious and well exceded my expectations.   :*)</li>
    <li> I have been on the search for a great deodorant and just did not find it in the secret clinical strength deodorant.  This is very good for sensitive skin (does not irritate my skin) and it only works half of the time (while sitting at a desk all day) Does not work at all when exercising or exerting myself in any way.  It has a light cucumber/aloe scent which I do not mind but I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product and definitely will not buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been diagnosed with hyperhydrosis, because I&#x27;ve never approached a doctor about the possibility, but I have suffered with from the symptoms for years. When Secret came out with their new Clinical Strength products it was like someone had answered my prayers. When you sweat like I do, regular antiperspirants and deodorants are ineffective. I&#x27;ve tried many other products with little to say for results, most last less than an hour before I&#x27;m soaked and stuck with not only body odor but a powdery or flowery mask mingled in. Gross!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Secret&#x27;s Clinical Strength products started hitting the shelves I became an instant fan. They haven&#x27;t cured my overly-sweaty nature, but they&#x27;ve helped reduce the dampness to a level I can live with. Fewer shirt changes on a daily basis means less laundry and much more confidence being active on my part. My only problem was that the original scents offered were both unpleasant to me. Powdery or flowery. Not much variety and while I don&#x27;t sweat as much I&#x27;m still sweaty enough that it matters to me what the deodorant smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ve since started offering this hypo-allergenic version which means literally NO scent! Since I like to wear a perfume or body spray on a regular basis this is a big plus as the scent of my antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t conflict with what else I&#x27;m wearing. I&#x27;ve also found I don&#x27;t get the same level of body odor when sweating either, perhaps the scents in the other products contribute to the smell in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t normally share such personal details but I really wanted to stress how wonderful this product is. The soft almost gooey solid is a little icky at first, but once you get the hang of applying it and find the right amount for you it isn&#x27;t so bad. If you suffer from hyperhydrosis (or you sweat much more than your peers) I am sure you know how hard it is to find the perfect products to make everyday perspiration bearable. I would highly reccommend trying this one, you&#x27;ve got only the $7-$9 cost to lose if it isn&#x27;t for you. I love this one and will be using this product for as long as I can get my hands on it.7-$9 cost to lose if it isn&#x27;t for you. I love this one and will be using this product for as long as I can get my hands on it.</li>
    <li> Since I went into peramenapause this works the best for me or should I say since my thermostat has been messed up!</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this item i was under the impression that is came with two.  That is false.  There was only one and the twist that makes the deodrant come out did NOT EVEN WORK.  I might have just received a faulty one but i was highly disappointed.  I fiddled with it for a couple weeks not wanting to give up and it finally worked. (very hard to twist though) Did not work as well as same product from target . do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, which I have faithfully used since it came out, and have been buying at Amazon at a savings compared with regular store prices. However, the listed price per ounce of $2.12 is incorrect on this particular product. It comes in a 1.6 ounce size, so the $2.12 per ounce would lead you to believe your $6.79 purchase would get you 3.2 ounces, or 2 deodorants. You only get one, making the actual price per ounce $4.24. If I had had this information before my purchase, I would have chosen another item. The deodorant itself is fine though, just more expensive than advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who don&#x27;t necessarily want their armpits smelling like flowers or fresh linens. I just don&#x27;t want them to smell at all.  Until this came out, no deodorant or antiperspirant worked for me, especially since all of them had some unnatural scent that I didn&#x27;t like. I love this product. And I ended up buying it on Amazon because I have such a hard time finding it in stores. Most shelves are stocked with other every variety except this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the deodorant isn&#x27;t exactly a solid  (it has a soft/mushy consistency), it does dry clear and doesn&#x27;t give me any irritation whatsoever - which is what&#x27;s most important for me.</li>
    <li> For years I had a big problem with deodorant, but with this product no more.... it is a great option!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found the sensitive skin version of Secret Clinical Strength.  I was using their powder scent as it was the least offensive smelling (to me) product Secret offered.  This one is great- so scent and is very gentle on the skin.  I&#x27;m on auto-delivery.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so I use this antiperspirant. Wish that it didn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff, but everything natural I try just doesn&#x27;t do the trick in the summer. Guess I&#x27;ll be sticking with this one for now...</li>
    <li> Creamy, soaks in pretty fast and truly odor free.  I can apply right after shaving, wait 1-2 minutes and then dress. It lasts much longer than 24 hours, even when I drip in sweat from menopausal events, my underarms are dry and never smelly.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is not unscented.  It smells like a light cucumber melon.  The active ingredients clearly list fragrance and masking fragrance.  I didn&#x27;t read that because so many reviewers said it was unscented.  How can a product be unscented and list twice that it has fragrance in it.  If you&#x27;re truly looking for unscented I would pass on this.  It doesn&#x27;t keep you any drier than any other deodorant/antiperspirant.  I&#x27;ll be looking for another clinical strength unscented deodorant to try.</li>
    <li> I can´t begin to express my joy at trying this deodorant. I consider myself to be a heavy sweater and live in the tropics, and it´s really embarrassing to have sweat stains or an odor arise in the middle of the day. With other products I found when putting them on the deodorant scent would sometimes overpower my perfume, or mix in with the sweat during the day and then I´d end up smelling worst than a dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this deodorant. It leaves no scent, it´s EFFECTIVE, I have ZERO wetness during the day and now I´m confident to raise my arms even when I´m outside in the heat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Secret, you have made me a more confident woman &#x3D;D</li>
