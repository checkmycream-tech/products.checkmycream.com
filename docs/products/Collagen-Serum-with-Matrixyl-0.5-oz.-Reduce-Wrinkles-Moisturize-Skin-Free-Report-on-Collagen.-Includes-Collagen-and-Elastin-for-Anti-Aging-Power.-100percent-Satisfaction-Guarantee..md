<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it, along with the day cream and I can see the difference after a week. I put the serum on in the morning and at night before bed. My skin is smoother and wrinkles are starting to relax. It feels cool and refreshing when you put it on, and it absorbs right away leaving no greasy feeling. I&#x27;m going to continue using this to keep looking younger.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum and would highly recommend it. Sublime Beauty continues to impress me with their high quality products. I have been using this serum for about a month now and my skin looks more youthful. The parentheses around my mouth have diminished significantly. My friends and I are in our late 30&#x27;s and they are already getting Botox and fillers while I am using this and other Sublime product and looking great.</li>
    <li> I really like the product, noticed results almost immediately.  My skin definetly looks younger and feels softer. Amazon please stop requiring that I enter so many words before I&#x27;m able to hit the submit!! It doesn&#x27;t take all that to say something is a great product! Furthermore, it discourages the buyer from even bothering.</li>
    <li> I have fine lines on my upper cheek. I applied it morning and night right after cleansing and toning. I see a difference by the third day. I usually see my makeup sinking into these lines by mid day, I do not see this anymore by the 2nd week. I also started to see dark circle in the last couple of years, I have ruled out lack of sleep and broken capillaries because I am the few people who actually get 8 to 9 hours each night, and my vitamin k cream is effective every where else.  I did see slight improvement of my dark circle with the vitamin K cream, but nothing like the success I have with this serum. I am now certain my dark circles are caused by diminished collagen around the eyes as I aged, thus making the blood vessels under the eyes easy to show thru the skin. I have not broken out at all. I cannot tell if my skin is softer as I already have pretty good softness and good color. It definitely fix my fine lines and dark circle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on recommendation from a friend, and it is great.  I have been using for about two weeks in combination with a good cleanser and toner and moisturizer and my skin is improving.  I use this after I use my D&#x27;arsonval High Frequency Direct Wand, and My skin just feels more supple and glows.  Yes I am A guy, but we deserve to have nice skin, too!</li>
    <li> All of the Sublime beauty products are wonderful.  I plan on continuing to use them all, I would recommend them to anyone who wants beautiful skin, soft and wrinkle free...</li>
    <li> I love this serum which comes out clear and goes on smooth.  I noticed less crows feet within a week!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I love that there are no parabens or artificial colors. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I&#x27;ve seen a slight improvement in fine lines in just a few days.</li>
    <li> It tightens up you skin when first applied.  I could not get used to its non perfumed natural smell similar to a protein odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen any long term changes due to this product after using it for several weeks regularly . Maybe my skin is not going to respond to Matrixyl and peptides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller is a lovely person to deal with and is very helpful. Product is in a sealed bottle protected from air oxidation or contamination from user&#x27;s fingers.</li>
    <li> I am a seasoned client when it comes to skin care and have tried most and some are very very expensive.  This product really does to better then most. I would have to put this serum in my top 2%.  This will continue to be my primary serum, I have learned through the years when you find something that works this good dont stop the program to find better just stick with what works.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone at any age but more so 40&#x27;s and up.  This product is doing amazing things for my skin. I use it twice a day and it is already firming and plumping my skin.  I am very patient when it comes to products working I felt it right away however I am into my 3rd week and I use it before my moisturizer. My daughter who is 28 yrs old told me my skin looks really good this week she said he had a natural pink color and my skin appeared to be naturally luminess (ha) she also told me it seems to be more firm..Exactly what I wanted from this product.....  She was not aware I had added a Collagen /peptide step in my daily program.  The peptides in this product really do a good job and I love how this product absorbs into the skin.  Sublime rocks wonderful service....no complaints here.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue the Auto-ship program.</li>
    <li> Make my skin so beautiful</li>
    <li> Started firming feeling after one use. Only takes one pump or even less to feel the effects. When I used more it almost felt too tight if there is such a thing haha. Quality is wonderful. Has almost zero scent which is important to me because I&#x27;m sensitive and get headaches. Haven&#x27;t had any due to this collagen serum yay! Good company also no animal testing and is cruelty free. I follow up with my moisturizer and it&#x27;s a perfect combination for the morning. Skin feels soft, less under eye circles, well moisturized and toned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product 8-22 and received it 8-29. First they will send you the product in a small baggie (like a cheap nylon cheese cloth) no instruction or whatsoever. I bought it because of the review ratings saying that they notice something on the second day, very light in your face after application, it somehow erases your black spots &amp; makes you looking younger BLAH BLAH.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well NO...After using the product in one month... NOTICE NOTHING....LIKE NONE. For that amount and the volume of the product I WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT AT ALL. It is completely waste of money. THe funny thing is some reviewers will say they see some effect on the 2nd and 3rd day but thats not totally true base on my experience. I now question the integrity of the reviews posted on this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if you need to use it for the rest of your life before you see some effect or what...Im just finishing up my first bottle and NO MORE ordering this JUNK product...OVERHYPED....</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my face feel smooth. It is a lightweight non scented drum. Isn&#x27;t sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on the product and purchased that night.&lt;br /&gt;It is feather light and non oily. I did notice after the second day my eyes looked &amp;#34;puffier&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The bags and dark areas were gone. The serum works great on the rest of my face and as one other reviewer stated, people I know ere saying my skin looked healthy and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the serum and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been several weeks since I began using the Sublime Beauty COLLAGEN SERUM.  I apply it after cleansing my face, let it dry  -  only a few seconds  - and then apply one of Sublime Beauty&#x27;s line smoothers and finally the Sublime Beauty cream I have selected for the day.  I am told that my facial skin has a smooth appearance, and &amp;#34;comparatively&amp;#34; unlined for the age of 80.  Consistency of facial care with a thoughtful use of a single product line I believe is the key.</li>
    <li> The serum really seems to be firming my skin in the month I&#x27;ve had it. I use it in conjunction with my usual products and it works well. My skin is more on the sensitive side and this serum does not sting when being applied. I apply it from the neck up and allow it to dry before putting on my moisturizer. I will keep using this product because I can see the difference and it is a great investment in the anti aging products. The company is also proactive in following up and providing reports to back up the results of their product.&lt;br /&gt;Collagen is so necessary for the skin once you pass your mid thirties. I highly recommend Sublime Beauty&#x27;s Collagen Serum.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> Good product but poor package.</li>
    <li> Smooth smooth smooth is what your face will feel like after using this. Goes on easy and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> For years I have looked for a product that will help the fine lines around my mouth and this product does it.  Wonderful.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a really good product.  The dark rings underneath my eyes actually&lt;br /&gt;look better after about 3 weeks use and I see frown and laugh lines smoothing&lt;br /&gt;out.</li>
    <li> I was using this product for about one month. It is good, will order more. Both, I and my wife use it.</li>
    <li> I may rated this higher but haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to make a determination to the quality of results received</li>
    <li> Ok I didn&#x27;t think this stuff would work but it does! They tell you to first put on the serum right after you wash your face let it seep into your skin then top with moisturizer...That works ok But for me? It works a bit better to first put on the moisturizer then put on the serum then I top with a biyt more moisturizer. but that&#x27;s just me. YOU DO SEE RESULTS FAST! at least I did! &amp;#34; a little goes a long way &amp;#34; great product I hope they never stop making it  heaven in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 2 weeks and it has helped my skin look much better.  I need to continue to use to see it&#x27;s real results, but it is making changes to the texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> This product felt light and that it penentrated into my skin.  I felt my eye area was getting nutrients for repairing.</li>
    <li> First, I love the packaging of my Sublime Beauty Collagen Serum. The sealed, pump bottle came inside a cute mesh bag tied up with a satin ribbon, and also included a card with the founder&#x27;s name, phone number and email address in case there were any questions. Anytime I see that level of detail and pride in the product, I immediately feel good about the overall quality. In the case of the Sublime Beauty Collagen Serum, that was certainly accurate. The serum had a very smooth texture and was easy to spread on my skin. It has a very subtle, barely noticeable scent and dries quickly, so there won&#x27;t be any negative interaction with other products you choose to use in your regime. I&#x27;m currently in my late 20s and plan to continue using this product to deal with the few wrinkles I currently have, as well as a preventative to protect my skin over the coming years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I am not really seeing any difference and have been using it now for several weeks.  I don&#x27;t know if I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I took a bit of time to use and thus really see the effects of this product. The customer service is great. You receive an email from the company after your purchase, asking for feedback. The bottles are small, as are most serums, but for the money you get a lot. I have observed an improvement in the overall color and texture of my skin. I will continue to use and now consider it a staple in my beauty regiment.</li>
    <li> This thing smells bad. I did not see any improvements or benefits claimed in adds. I&#x27;m not buying this product again</li>
    <li> This product is ineffective and I would suggest purchasing over the counter products that actually work. I was disappointed in this particular product.</li>
    <li> Was expecting just another beauty product that doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s touted to do, but this time I hit a winner.  Bought 2 of these, one for my elderly mother and one for me.  We BOTH thought it worked well and improved our wrinkle lines and skin.  This container lasted me 3 weeks, with 2 pumps per night used.  It lasted one month for my mother, also using 2 pumps per night.  The product is excellent, but I&#x27;d like a larger supply in one container please.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love trying new face creams, lotions and serums so when I was given the opportunity to try this Sublime Beauty Collagen Serum at a special price to test for quality and review I was elated.  I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet and plan to keep it that way.  I have been using this serum twice a day, morning and night, after cleansing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself has virtually no odor and was easily absorbed by my skin.  I used a Q-tip to apply it under my eyes where I have been experiencing some dark circles.  It does not leave a greasy feeling at all.  It only takes about 3 pumps to do my entire face.  After application, I follow up with my usual moisturizing face cream.  After about 3 days of use, I noticed that the darkness under my eyes had diminished and they seemed to have plumped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have numerous face products, some cheap, some expensive and the products I have from Sublime Beauty are some of the best.  I will definitely continue to use this serum to help keep the wrinkles at bay.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products, LaPraire, N.V. Parricone, Dr Brandts, etc and this one takes the cake! I notice results within the first week! I had an issue with a defective bottle and the seller sent me a new one without me asking.  With other products that would not have happend.  The great part about this product is your getting so many different acids and vitamins that are so good for your skin in one bottle! I use this in the am/pm and can&#x27;t wait to try other sublime beauty products! This is a must in a your skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I have been applying this every morning after washing my face, and I love it.  It is so lightweight, non-greasy, and makes my face feel refreshed.  It pairs well with my moisturizer, and I am already noticing results.  Definitely adding this to my morning regiment.</li>
    <li> Bought the retinol serum and collagen serum.  Have been using both products for a few months now and see no difference.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feel great.  It is not oily and easily absorbed.  I use it morning and night and under my makeup.</li>
    <li> I am a 53 yr. old &#x27;girl&#x27; with olive toned skin and icky skin at best. I&#x27;ve used a very &#x27;high grade&#x27; product line for the last 4-5 years with no real results. I have the oiliest skin ever, so I am always concerned about it getting oilier. That is my number 1 issue. I just started using this line, Night &amp; Day Whisperer, hyaluronic, collagen, retinol, and vit. c serums. They DO NOT make my skin oilier, yay!  I have also ordered the Vit. C toner and body oil. I used to dry brush, but want to get back into it and am looking forward to the body oil, as I have moved to a dryer area.  I also am hypo-thyroid (low thyroid, ie. dry skin). One of the best things I like about these products is that they are contained in pump style containers. Every time you use the product, you get the same amount and you don&#x27;t contaminate it by having to dip your fingers in the product. I also received an email from the owner asking if I had received my products. That was cool. It was a great opportunity to ask my &#x27;detailed&#x27; questions, which were answered within an unbelievable minute. I can see some of my fine wrinkles around my eyes doing the disappearing act or atleast reducing in depth. I am so looking forward to see my face in 1, 2 and 3 months. I am very excited about this line of skin care products. I am a girly girl, and love make up and such, but I don&#x27;t mess around with taking care of my skin. I am diligent about removing my makeup nightly even if I am not sober. Sublime Products go on fast, are light and sink into your skin quickly. No weird residue and it doesn&#x27;t increase the oil in my oily skin. So far, I am completely sold on this company, their products and their customer service!  And no, I don&#x27;t work for the company, I&#x27;m just a happy girl.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say thatthe product has made any significant change in my skin, so I won&#x27;t give it a negative review, just a neutral one. I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost a month, - maybe that&#x27;s not enough time,  One criticism I do have is that you have to be careful when you push the pump down - make sure you hold the pump close to your palm and depress it slowly, otherwise the product will squirt out and you could lose product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I run out, I will consider ordering again to give it some more time.  People who use a product like this for 2 days and immediately have positive results are very lucky - glad it&#x27;s so effective for them.</li>
    <li> Using it now wish bottle was bigger. I have to give it more time to really have an opinion. So ladies I&#x27;ll get back to you!!</li>
    <li> The product itself seems to be very good and I&#x27;m pleased with the results, that said I must voice my displeasure with the container itself.  It is a pump action container and the pump does not push down smoothly causing the serum to be released so fast that some gets lost in the propulsion or the pump needs to be pushed down twice and then more serum is dispensed than desired.  This is my second purchase so I&#x27;m confident it wasn&#x27;t a faulty container...that is a flaw in the design.</li>
    <li> Collagen Serum | Peptide Rich by Sublime Beauty®. Matrixyl is the star peptide here, which can double collagen production! Loss of Collagen equals Aging Skin. Unique blend of beneficial ingredients that rejuvenate &amp; fight wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I purchased 4 products from this company (Sublime Beauty) thus far and I loove love all of them! As some other reviewers have said you do get what you pay for. Quality products! I know some of them are a bit expensive, but worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The collegen serum by far is my absolute fav! It leaves my skin soft, supple, a bit brighter and feeling replenished. It even helps to make my stubborn acne and blemishes minimized!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retinol does the same-although my second week I have expierenced minor irritation due to my very very sensative skin. This is unfortunate because this product is just as awsome! It gives me the same results as the collagen but with much brighter complexion, smooth tone and even helps to speed clear my blemishes! Both tighten the skin suddely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face whisper, OMG leaves my skin ever so moisterized but not greasy. It also left my face soft to touch. I believe this combined with the serum/s (either or) have helped to clear my skin some. Also I dont have many wrinkles but the ones that were starting to appear are deminishing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love the nourishing cleanser with aloe and green tea, very moisterizing, not sudsy soap and leaves my face feeling clean, supple and not dry! This will definetly be a staple product for me along with the collagen and face whisper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly the citrus cleanser I love this as well but I expierenced minor irritation week 2 from this cleanser on my face although I believe this is a great soap to help with acne. It did help clear me up at the beginning. It works wonderfully on my body however so I will continue to use. This is a very gentle exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am indian/ black decent.&lt;br /&gt;Definetly give these products a try! I plan on purchasing the foot scrub next!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my products came damaged shipped from Amazon, not the seller and ( Kathy-the founder)has offered to replace them and the fault was not with her! I have yet to recieve them but Imsure its just a matter of time ;)&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend these products! Hope this review helps as I rarely will write a review.</li>
    <li> Good so far moisturizing. Need to give it more time to see any actual results</li>
    <li> I have seen a difference in minimizing some fine lines. The only reason why i rate 4 stars is because not all lines are gone. Maybe with longer use they may be gone. I like the lightweight serum and it absorbs quickly.  There is not a sticky feeling to it.</li>
    <li> The word Collagen got me from the beginning.  The word Serum was also a very important thing for me.  I hate those creams&lt;br /&gt;that are too mushy, greasy, or hard to wash away.  This product is great.  I find it very helpful in maintaining my skin soft and free of wrinkles although I&#x27;m nearing the end of my 60s.  Of course I also have the help of good genes that my parents passed on to me, but that&#x27;s no enough if you don&#x27;t take care of that gift.  I do and I have tried soooo many creams and potions that my dressing table looks like it belongs to a &amp;#34;entertainer or rich old woman&amp;#34;... ha.  I&#x27;m trying to finish with all the other products because I don&#x27;t like to throw away my money, but I notice the difference that this &amp;#34;Sublime&amp;#34; product does on my skin in comparison with all the other ones -- of course I don&#x27;t use them all at the same time.... duh!  This product is a keeper and will buy it again and recommend it to anyone who wants to extend the beauty of your skin as long as possible.</li>
    <li> I really love this serum. It really makes my face look and feel great. It really helps my skin feel supple.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Collagen Serum for almost 2 weeks and I have nothing but good things to say about it.  It is very lightweight and non-greasy so it&#x27;s perfect to apply before makeup.  I have already started to notice that my face looks softer, my pores look smaller and the delicate skin around my eyes lifted.  Works much better than products I&#x27;ve paid double the price for.  The company is great too, even emailing me to make sure I am happy with their product. I am anxious to try other Sublime Beauty products in conjunction with the Collagen Serum.</li>
    <li> Not sure if  this really helps with collagen growth. Having been using it for a month and will reorder. Absorbs quickly and does not leave a shine.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any improvement yet.  Let&#x27;s wait another month.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say whether this product worked or not.  I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin and it only lasted about 3 weeks.  I love the Face Whisperer Neck and Décolleté product but will pass on this one.</li>
    <li> This is the best, Not sticky after application like most out there, if you are buying that sticky product, you are wasting your money, dries very quickly. once dry, I apply my make up and my under eyes NEVER dries out-period.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this over and over.</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie but have rarely purchased facial products from Amazon.  I am so glad I came across this product and decided to give it a try.  For the price, it has given me unbelievable results.  I used to wake up looking sort of ashy and tired every morning.  Now, I am still tired (have a five year old) but my face started having this dewy glow in the morning.  I had used the product less than a week before I started noticing it.  Now in all fairness, I do use a lot of products (serums, scrubs, you name it- I am in my early forties) but this is the only product that had recently been added to my arsenal so I am going to give most of the credit to it.  I am very happy with the purchase and if you&#x27;re looking for something to give your skin a lovely boost, I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Probably one of the best Collagen products I have used.  I&#x27;ll see how it works as I use it longer.</li>
    <li> I am in my 60s and doing as much as I can to preserve my skin from wrinkling.  A daunting task, but I believe the liquid collagen is helping a lot.  I take collagen tablets too for my entire body, but really like having access to a liquid that I can use directly on my face.  I apprecite also that Sublime Beauty has written to me twice to make sure that I like their products!</li>
    <li> I love all the Sublime Beauty products that I have bought, but for some reason, this product is too harsh for my skin.  It burns and makes me break out.</li>
    <li> This product did not appear to make any difference in the appearance of my skin. I&#x27;m an esthician, and make my own vitamin c serum, see more results from that. Expensive for that type of results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for past few weeks. I notice my face&#x27;s skin is less saggy and more firm. Great product...Great value</li>
    <li> Didnt care for product. Very thick.</li>
    <li> This product contains urea which I happen to be allergic to.  Many people are actually allergic to urea so I don&#x27;t know why skin care companies still use this as an ingredient in their products.  Anyway, I&#x27;m sending my unopened product back to Amazon for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve revised and updated this review because of the wonderful customer service from this company. I still can&#x27;t use the product because of the urea but Kathy from the company has been working with me to find me a similar product that won&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I always appreciate good customer service and more sellers should understand the power of it.</li>
    <li> I have been taking care of my skin since I was 13 and I will be 49 next month. I feel this product is an additional assest to my products.  I have noticed that my facial skin gets &amp;#34;accustomed&amp;#34; to a product after 3-6 months and then my skin does not look as good as it did before, so what I do is &amp;#34;switch&amp;#34; to another very good products and then switch back to the original in 3 months.  I suppose I am trying to keep my skin to be receptive of the good products.  Try that.  I would still buy this again.  Word to the wise, teacher your children boys and girls to start caring for their skin at middle school age and then it really pays off. My son is 23 years old and he says he already has less sun damage and sagging skin then some girls his age.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product, let alone like it.  I have used this exclusively since January, and it has not done a thing.  I was using a fabulous product from Italy, but sadly they were bought out by another company and the product is no longer available.  Extremely disappointed</li>
    <li> AMAZING product!  Within 2 weeks, I noticed a dramatic improvement in skin tightening, wrinkles and under eye loosening of skin/wrinkles (nearly gone).  I use it twice a day under moisturizer.  I have used a lot of products over the years and this is the first one that has given me such great results.  It is turning back the clock!  Thank you and I will continue to use the product!!!</li>
    <li> For years I used a product called Colladerm, which has unfortunately been discontinued.  Collagen Serum is the only product that is similar.  Very nice moisturizer, especially around eye area.  I will continue to purchase this.  Expensive but you only need a little!</li>
    <li> The collagen serum is very light and goes on smoothly. It has helped the wrinkles on my face and I&#x27;ve been using it daily under my moisturizer. Just wish the bottle had a better pump. Too much of the serum comes out in one pump.</li>
    <li> BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU SEE RESULTS IMMEDIATELY, I BOUGHT MY 2 BOTTLE AND IS AWESOME, I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT, MALE OR FEMALE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REAL CUSTOMER.</li>
    <li> Really pleased with the results and would recommend it to all.&lt;br /&gt;My face is looking better every day and the price is nice too.</li>
    <li> I like that this product not only contains collagen and peptides for more youthful looking skin but it also contains aloe which is so soothing and moisturizing. We need to take better care of our skin as we age, and this product aims to do just that. Can&#x27;t wait to start looking younger!</li>
    <li> I think that this product is doing a good job of softening my skin.  Have only been using it for about 2 weeks, and I don&#x27;t notice any reduction in wrinkles yet, but it IS early.  It&#x27;s pleasant to use, not heavy and comes in a push pump bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add:  Although I really like this product, it&#x27;s running out rather quickly.  Although the pump measures the \\&quot;dose\\&quot;, and I haven&#x27;t overused the product, I am running out already!</li>
    <li> I usually don’t write reviews but will make an exception with this one. Sublime Beauty Collagen Serum is the best product my wife has tried. We are a senior couple trying to age gracefully.  My wife has been a Rep for a major cosmetic house for over 30 years.  She has always been a strong supporter of their product line. As she has begun to age she noticed lines in her neck and blotches on her face. We tried products in the line she worked for and some top names in treatment. This is the first product she has raved about. It took about a week and the redness from the blotches disappeared and the lines in her neck were improved. It has now been two weeks and we have reordered the Serum.  The lines in her neck are continuing to disappear. We are amazed at the results. We highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Will definitely continue  to use and buy this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this Collagen Serum!  First off it arrived in this cute little white bag with white ribbon tied around it which totally started it off right for me!  And the bottle itself is super cute!  I just love the look!  It is only a 15 mL bottle but that is completely normal since it is a serum and it is a great price!  I have tried products that were way more expensive in half the bottle without the same results as I have had using this serum.  I love that it is a pump which makes using it a little easier.  I do wish it was clear so I could see how much I have left!  That is my only improvement to the product because I have loved everything about it so far!  It does a light smell that I can&#x27;t quite explain.  It doesn&#x27;t stink at all but there is some scent I think from the Aloe Leaf Juice that is in it.  I grew up using Aloe plants so I love the smell myself.  One thing to know about this serum is a little bit really does go a long way so you don&#x27;t need much when applying it to your face.  I really liked the way it rubbed in pretty quickly.  It really did kind of remind me of using the Aloe Juice but better!  I liked how bright and young my face looked after using this for a few days!  I can&#x27;t quite say if it has diminished my fine lines and wrinkles yet but I can say that they were softer and less noticeable so in my opinion that is a plus for me!  I like how I can still apply my moisturizer over it for that extra added benefit for my skin!  Overall I really do love this product from it&#x27;s beautiful packaging to it&#x27;s actual serum and how it has worked for me!  I did receive this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions shared in this review are solely my own!  I always make sure to test each product I review myself so that I can give my honest opinion!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night since I received it and it really moisturizes my dry skin. Skin looks fresh in the a.m.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I love the Sublime Beauty Line. They make amazing products!! I recently got the Collagen Serum for a spectacular price and just have to tell you how amazing I think that it is. I am in my 20’s and love to use creams to help with my complexion as well as keep me looking young. This Collagen Serum is so amazing, it rubs right into your skin leaving no oil feeling which is something I absolutely love about this cream. After using this I have seen an increase in the way my complexion looks, its more even! Thank you Sublime Beauty for making yet another great product!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products</li>
    <li> I have very.  Normal  skin very cousins about what I try&lt;br /&gt;I only use it in the morning for about 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;So far so good</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like citrus blend creams they wreck my skin as I have very sensitive skin!  I have had  better luck&lt;br /&gt;with oil of olay &amp; the cost is probably half what I paid for this cream!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and has seen favorable results. It took about two weeks for her to make a decision on it working but now I know.</li>
    <li> I have been using three weeks now and my skin looks and feels great. As far as helping with wrinkles they seem to be disappearing but to early to make that decision.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to post this anywhere I can.  I&#x27;m so impressed with these products.  I feel like I&#x27;ve spent enough money to buy a house over the years with the amount of money I&#x27;ve spent on products that said they were supposed to improve the skin but didn&#x27;t deliver as promised.  Finally, something that does what it says it does and not just for the pictures in the magazine, for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently turned 58.  This year my skin has gotten more wrinkles and I have developed bags under my eyes I never had before.  I was told it was because my skin doesn&#x27;t produce collagen much anymore.  I have tried different products to improve both my skin and the bags, but nothing made a difference until I started working with the Sublime line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, they really are moisturizing!  My skin feels more supple.  The peptides in the Collagen Serum really have actually reduced the appearance of my wrinkles and the bags under my eyes!  I&#x27;ve seen before and after pictures in commercials, so I decided to try one myself because, since I look at myself every day, I figured I might not see a change, but the camera sees it.  Sublime Beauty claims the anti-aging effects of the anti-oxidents help our skin look better and mine actually does.  Please don&#x27;t laugh, it&#x27;s like getting a mini-face lift.  My skin looks and feels so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with just one product so I could see which one made a difference.  Based on how well the Collagen Serum worked, I began using some of their other products, adding them in one at a time to test them out.  They are also improving the quality of my skin.  It really is getting better and better.  I&#x27;ll post reviews of what I&#x27;ve found with some of the other products I&#x27;ve started using including the Retinol Serum, Face Whisperer, and the Pure Luxury Mask.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! It took me a while to write this review because I wanted to be sure it was working and yes, it does work. I could see results within 2 weeks. People have even commented on how much &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; I look.</li>
    <li> Since  I started using collagen Serum , I was so amazed with the result , it works so great on my  dull and tired skin  including my puffy eye bag. After a week of using it , I realized  my skin looked brighter and moist . In addition the puffiness of my eye bag has gradually improved . I am so happy with the result, and the great customer service. Thank you .</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised to discover that after 4 weeks of using this product my skin does in fact look better, softer and the wrinkles around my eyes aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable. This cream was easily absorbed. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it makes my face very smooth and has helped to fade dark spots.</li>
    <li> Good Collagen beauty product  and it is affordable.  There is quite a bit in the container.  It feels good to the skin and helps to to brighten</li>
    <li> Not sure if I noticed a huge difference when using this. I used all of it in one month. My face felt...softer...ish</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. So many products claim the moon, but don&#x27;t come through. This product started making my face f eel sosoft RIGHT AWAY!  Only sorry it ran out so zoo.  Expensive, but works!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product a couple of weeks now and I see great results in the overall appearance of my skin.  The wrinkles are less prominent and my skin looks more youthful.  I use this daily in the evening after I apply a small amount of organic coconut oil on the dry areas of my face.  After the serum, I apply my usual night moisturizing lotion.  I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems at all with this product.  I plan to try some of Sublime Beauty&#x27;s other products soon.</li>
    <li> Just like any other cream.</li>
    <li> My go to day serum that I absolutely couldn&#x27;t live without or go a day without! It&#x27;s made such a difference in my 60 yr. old face.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend.  Did not like or see any benefit.  Found Target brand of eye cream to be much nicer especially considering the cost.</li>
    <li> I think this is an excellent product...and so does my sister in England..except now I have to buy 2 of every Sublime Beauty Iproduct...I love this line ...Elizabeth Bought this again and still love it..my sister loves it too but it is more expensive in England so I have to take it to her..I have bought many Collagen serums but this is the best..</li>
    <li> So excited about this product.  I have been taking sublime vitamins for months now and just love it.  I will tell you this I am sold on these products.  My skin is radiant and has taken on a new life and fresh look.  I am so thankful that my face and my skin must have been craving these ingredients.  That is what must have happened.  I have received alot of comments from other women in my gatherings with them.  I do tell them what I have found but between you and I, this would be a well found secret if I was being selfish.  Just try these products like I did and fall in love with your skin and the glow people will notice.  Trust that. This Collagen Serum just raises my skin to a completely new level.  Sublime vitamins plus this Serum just works for me. Forever grateful,  Sherri</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a few days now &amp; I can honestly see an improvement in my skin.  Pores are smaller.  Lines seem diminished &amp; my skin feels very soft &amp; smooth.  So far so good.  I will continue to use under my Sublime Beauty Day/Night creams.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference at all.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing, not applicable as serum it was more like a sticky gel that covered the skin instead of adsorbing in the skin.</li>
    <li> I used the collagen serum religiously, in conjunction with the retinol serum, for one week while my girlfriend was away one business ( curiosity got the better of me when I saw that she had left them on the bathroom counter).  I would use the retinol just before bedtime &amp; the collagen the following morning, after shower.  Both the collagen &amp; retinol products feel good on my skin when applied.  They feel cool &amp; smooth on my face; not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;My family &amp; friends came over for some grilling this holiday weekend &amp; I couldn&#x27;t help but smile as I seemed to get all these compliments about looking fresh, well rested, and happy.  I&#x27;m a big believer in these products now.  Problem is that I have to order my own serums so my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t get mad at me for using her supply.  Thank God, for the easy ordering, and fast delivery of Sublime Beauty products through Amazon.</li>
    <li> All Sublime Beauty products work great and I love them.  So when this was available I had to grab it to add to my growing collection.  I can not get enough of this product for real.  Love seeing the results change weekly.  I am very new at taking care of my skin at the age of 46, I started late.  I am a Tom Boy, and even though my mother tried to tell me to use more moisturizer, I never listened.  My dad didn&#x27;t so I did not need.  Well those wrinkles are showing now and I wish I would have listened.  Sublime Beauty Has made it a easy process though!!!!  Amazon Discaimer, This is my own honest and unbiased review of product.</li>
    <li> This is a Great moisturizer. It is a nice size bottle also. It really leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Having worked in an exclusive spa in Palm Beach, Florida, I am no stranger to quality facial products. I have to say that for the price that this is one of the best products that I have used. It isn&#x27;t oily and goes on smooth. My face looked and felt better in a matter of days. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I found this collagen serum very helpful for the fine lines and also a nice tightening effect. So easy to use one or two nights a week at bedtime.</li>
