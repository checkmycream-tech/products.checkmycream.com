    <li> I need this magnification to apply makeup. This is a great mirror, but I wish it were bigger so I could see better.</li>
    <li> The mirror is fine.  I should have gotten a larger mirror.</li>
    <li> Because I can&#x27;t find this much magnification where I live in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;Like the suction cups so I can place wherever.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific mirror but it does not stay on surface and I have had two suddenly fall and break after being put on another surface.  This has happened months later after using with the suction cups.  Not sure why it does not stay but it has become expensive to replace a good quality magnifying mirror.</li>
    <li> To small thought I was ordering larger mirror...wish it was a larger mirror.  Great 10X however.</li>
    <li> This item was received quickly.  It was a b-day present.....the receipient loves it.  Easy to suction cup to larger mirror.  Great magnification.  Wish I would have bought one for myself too.</li>
    <li> The first mirror they sent me was broken and it was too small. I called and they were so nice and accommodating.

    <li> This mirror is great quality and the 3 suction cups are very secure.  I received my merchandise promptly from the seller. Very pleased, I would like to have one a little larger. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what it says it is.  I will use it until I can find what I want.  I am  trying to replace a mirror that was broken during a recent flight.  It was the same mirror only larger in circumference.</li>
    <li> I have bought several mirrors looking for one the offers the magnifying capacity to allow me to really see my skin with my 40 plus year old eyes.  I wish it is was a bit bigger but other than that I love it.</li>

    <li> I love this mirror&#x27;s clarity.  There is no waving or distortion.  The 10X magnification allowes me to see the most minute details.  As a makeup mirror it&#x27;s the very best.  I plan on ordering another one for my downstairs bath very soon.  I recommend this mirror above all the rest!  You won&#x27;t be sorry that you bought this one.</li>
    <li> Suction Cup 10X Magnifying Mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is high quality magnifying mirror and looks good also.  The mirror is built well and the suctions cups really work well.  I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one.</li>

    <li> This was a well-made product but I found 10X too powerful.  I returned the item and traded for 5X power mirror.  Good service from company.  Very satisfied with product now.  Suction cups hold securely.  Very useful for personal hygiene.</li>

    <li> Too much magnifying.  Very distorted unless right on top of.  I should have ordered lesser magnifying.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t apply my make-up without it!</li>
    <li> I like the magnification and the fact that it does have suction cups, but I would like it to be about an inch bigger.  I use it to put my eye makeup on, and it works OK but would be better if it were just a bit bigger.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs a little more help with getting their eyemake up on straight and any task that they need to be able to see better.</li>
    <li> diameter considered too small for the 10x magnification</li>
