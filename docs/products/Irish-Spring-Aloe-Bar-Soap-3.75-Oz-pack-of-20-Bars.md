### Positive Reviews

<ol>

      <li>Great price and very quick delivery</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s deluxe.</li>
      <li>the Aloe addition is nice.</li>
      <li>Great deal fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Good soad, nice smell, the regular is a bit drying to my skin so the with Aloe is great</li>
      <li>We love this soap and decided to order instead of jumping in car and going to Target.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this soap; all stocked up.</li>
      <li>My favorite soap.</li>
      <li>I also like the scent better.</li>
      <li>Nice product, received quick.</li>
      <li>It was old and does not smell good.</li>
      <li>Meant to order original scent.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be as clean as a whistle.</li>
      <li>but I really prefer the original.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t give more than three stars simply because it was not what I ordered.</li>
      <li>This seems to be a better price that where I can get it locally.</li>
      <li>I prefer Irish Spring Original but could not find it in a 20 bar pack for the price I was willing to pay.</li>
      <li>but not as much any more so had to look online, little more expensive than I would like to pay but good soap.</li>
      <li>I like this better than the regular irish spring.  </li>
      <li>It works, it washes off cleanly (unlike some other deodorant soaps), and it still has that classic smell.</li>
      <li>This defeats the purpose of getting a better price per bar, especially if I use twice as much as a single bar of Irish Spring Original over the same time period.</li>

    <li> It was old and does not smell good.</li>
    <li> Nice product, received quick.</li>
    <li> Irritates my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it is but this soap irratates my skin and it is really annoying.</li>
    <li> Great price and very quick delivery</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the soap and the Aloe addition is nice.</li>
    <li> We love this soap and decided to order instead of jumping in car and going to Target.</li>
    <li> Great deal fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I like Irish Spring. I don&#x27;t like dry skin. Solution? Add aloe. It works, it washes off cleanly (unlike some other deodorant soaps), and it still has that classic smell. 20 bars at once, dropped on my front step, and I don&#x27;t even have to carry them from the car. That&#x27;s deluxe.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my regular soap and I won&#x27;t change. I love this stuff. No overwhelming smell, washes off completely, leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap. Hard to find aloe these days.</li>
    <li> I like this better than the regular irish spring.  It leaves my skin a little less dry than the regular version.  I also like the scent better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for years, and now I can get it even cheaper than it was before.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this soap.  This seems to be a better price that where I can get it locally.</li>
    <li> Good soad, nice smell, the regular is a bit drying to my skin so the with Aloe is great, Costco used to always have it but not as much any more so had to look online, little more expensive than I would like to pay but good soap.</li>
    <li> Received item on time, as described.</li>
    <li> I prefer Irish Spring Original but could not find it in a 20 bar pack for the price I was willing to pay. I opted to try Irish Spring with Aloe and while I can take or leave Aloe in my soap the product did not disappoint, especially for the price and quantity. The only disappointment is how quickly a single bar dissolves with use; twice as fast or faster than a bar of Irish Spring Original. This defeats the purpose of getting a better price per bar, especially if I use twice as much as a single bar of Irish Spring Original over the same time period.</li>
    <li> Love this soap; all stocked up.</li>
    <li> I been using this brand of soap forever. When you buy the 20 pack You are getting a bar of soap for less then a dollar and you&#x27;ll be as clean as a whistle.</li>
    <li> I was not paying attention when I ordered this.  Meant to order original scent.  The product is good but I really prefer the original.</li>
    <li> I possibly wrote a horrible review for this product. It was a mistake, it was supposed to be for Johnson&#x27;s Baby Power. See information regarding that on it&#x27;s review.</li>
