### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>In my experience, Nivea is one of the best products for skin care.</li>
      <li>I use this for acne and it&#x27;s the best stuff out there for me.  </li>
      <li>, I ran out, and I had an acne scrub that was supposed to be great for acne, yea, its great for acne, great for making you get Acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>face wash does a great job of cleaning and treating my stubble before a shave.</li>
      <li>and it works great</li>
      <li>However, the smell is pleasant.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really good</li>
      <li>it is with good quality, make face in a good condition after using.</li>
      <li>Amazing product from Nivea.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying it because it&#x27;s effective, but I sure wouldn&#x27;t mind if it were more pleasant</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>, i will pay more attention to this shop, everything runs well</li>
      <li>I will be buying more but hopefully at a better price somewhere else.  </li>
      <li>Cetaphil was actually better for me.</li>
      <li>But love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nivea has come up with another winner for men wanting to take better care of their skin.</li>
      <li>More menthol would be nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice product to clean dirt and oil on face~</li>
      <li>The scent is also nice, not too strong  and not too light either.</li>
      <li>The shipping was very fast, and it came in nice packaging.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good, it does not dry your skin and cleans pretty good.</li>
      <li>I been using it and it works fine.</li>
      <li>I love this soap because it is great for skin that can easily dry out.</li>
      <li>: you can find this stuff at Target now for cheap.</li>
      <li>I was happy, I was ecstatic about it, as I finally found something that worked!  </li>
      <li>It smells good and is not rough on the skin, it has mini scrub-balls that helps scrub dirt away.</li>
      <li>I get a clean feeling around the oily parts without the drying around the rest of my face.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It does make your face feel cool, clean, and moisturized at the end of the shower as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually started using it on days I don&#x27;t shave just to keep my skin in good condition.</li>
      <li>product does have a mild scent, despite what another reviewer said, but it&#x27;s a clean, masculine scent that smells pretty good.  </li>
      <li>And the price is a liitle high than that in many stores..</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thankfully, Nivea For Men&#x27;s Double Action Face Wash has proven to be an effective solution to most of my problems.  </li>
      <li>But it is not so worth.</li>
      <li>Even better, its scent is pleasant yet masculine, with none of that heavy soapy smell that lingers for hours.</li>
      <li>When I switched from Cetaphil to this product, I went from very light acne to moderate acne.  </li>
      <li>The good - it cleans your face - very well - and in a way that really gets everything - but without drying out your face, probably better than any other face wash I&#x27;ve used (to be clear, I&#x27;ve probably tried all of the stuff you can buy at Target or Walgreens, if it&#x27;s &amp;#62;$20 a bottle, I don&#x27;t really know anything about</li>
      <li>but I use it once or twice a day in hot showers.</li>
      <li>By the end of the first week, all my acne was gone, from using this alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>Real men don&#x27;t use skin care products, right?  </li>
      <li>I use to have an acne problem and used many products to get rid of them, eventually I gave up and started to concentrate on just washing my face with something that didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
      <li>This wash leaves your skin feeling clean and not dry.</li>
      <li>The product works very well.</li>
      <li>Other face washes seem to be more gentle, even ones with medication in them.  </li>
      <li>arrived on time, feel fresh and clean, but after a few weeks i still waiting for see some changes on my face skin.</li>
      <li>It is gentle on my sensitive skin and cleans off dirt and oil</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with both oily and dry facial skin since my high school years, and finding the right products to deal with them hasn&#x27;t always been easy, particularly for the dry skin</li>
      <li>the price, this can&#x27;t be beat, and when I do spend more on other products, I still go back to my Nivea.</li>
      <li>I was kind of skeptical when I first tried it</li>
      <li>Actually, I did shave, but it was very painful.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shipping took nearly two weeks.</li>
      <li>My face is slightly oily around certain areas such as the forehead and around the nose, while the rest of my face dries out.  </li>

<li> The price is a little high.</li>
<li> I was skeptical about buying this because of the low price, but it works way better than expected.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many products, ranging from cocoa butter to Curel or generic moisturizers; they&#x27;ve helped some, but I hate the cold goopy feeling of the moisturizers -- especially in cool weather -- and I sometimes forget to apply them.  </li>
<li> Maybe my skin is too sensitive, but it took a few days to recover from the redness caused by the wash.  </li>
<li> I mean, who wants to smell like they spent the afternoon in a French brothel?  </li>
<li> I figured what the heck, what did I have to loose?  </li>
<li> (I still get oily skin when I&#x27;m stressed, too) without irritating or burning, and if used dilligently and in conjunction with Nivea For Men&#x27;s other products (Exfoliating Scrub, After Shave Balm), the Double Action Face Wash soothes and moisturizes the dreaded red-and-dry patches of skin.</li>
<li> It says to use it every other day</li>
<li> Also - it&#x27;s less mentholated than other menthol face washes.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with acne, and problems with my pores being clogged, along with black heads, and so on, and so forth.&lt;br</li>
<li> not very good as I expected.</li>
<li> I have a small acne problem and i have tried other brands of face wash with little to no results.</li>
<li> Worse, if my skin is red and blotchy from stress, the soap will burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This actually made my acne worse.  </li>
<li> And, I&#x27;ve noticed that unlike plain soap, I can shave easier after washing my face with this product.  </li>
<li> bad - it smells mildly like glue and is somewhat viscous and sticky and hard to get off my face.</li>
<li> Nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
<li> I fully bought into the Nivea shaving line when it was introduced and have never enjoyed shaving so much.&lt;br</li>
<li> Moreover, I still have to wash my face at least twice a day; if I use regular soap for a long stretch of time I&#x27;ll get these terrible dry skin patches.  </li>
<li> &quot; type of thing, thinking that it would at least make my face feel</li>
<li> Buy it there instead of waiting for this crazy long shipping.</li>
<li> My main complaint is that it dried out my skin terribly.  </li>
<li> I bought this skeptical it would work, boy did it ever.</li>
<li> acne medications have failed me, along with their acne washes.  </li>
<li> In time, those ugly patches start diminishing in size and will eventually vanish.  </li>
<li> However, I was greatly disappointed after trying this wash.  </li>
<li> Terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice product to clean dirt and oil on face~</li>
    <li> I use to have an acne problem and used many products to get rid of them, eventually I gave up and started to concentrate on just washing my face with something that didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. A month after using Nivea my acne went away and this product is not even for acne! It says to use it every other day but I use it once or twice a day in hot showers. This wash leaves your skin feeling clean and not dry. It smells good and is not rough on the skin, it has mini scrub-balls that helps scrub dirt away. I have been using this product for four years and it works great, you see results in three weeks.</li>
    <li> Bah!  Real men don&#x27;t use skin care products, right?  I mean, who wants to smell like they spent the afternoon in a French brothel?  &lt;br /&gt;Well, after my skin broke out for no apparent reason, a female friend suggested that I try a glycerin-based facial cleanser.  I figured what the heck, what did I have to loose?  I decided to give it a try.    &lt;br /&gt;Since then, I haven&#x27;t had any skin blemishes.  And, I&#x27;ve noticed that unlike plain soap, I can shave easier after washing my face with this product.  &lt;br /&gt;Unlike aftershave lotions, this cleanser doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance.</li>
    <li> This actually made my acne worse.  When I switched from Cetaphil to this product, I went from very light acne to moderate acne.  Cetaphil was actually better for me.</li>
    <li> Actually, I did shave, but it was very painful.&lt;br /&gt;Nivea has come up with another winner for men wanting to take better care of their skin. I fully bought into the Nivea shaving line when it was introduced and have never enjoyed shaving so much.&lt;br /&gt;The face wash does a great job of cleaning and treating my stubble before a shave. I&#x27;ve actually started using it on days I don&#x27;t shave just to keep my skin in good condition. &lt;br /&gt;This product does have a mild scent, despite what another reviewer said, but it&#x27;s a clean, masculine scent that smells pretty good.  &lt;br /&gt;For the price, this can&#x27;t be beat, and when I do spend more on other products, I still go back to my Nivea.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, it does not dry your skin and cleans pretty good. I&#x27;m not a person who uses alot of facial creams or anything but in my opinion it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good price</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this because of the low price, but it works way better than expected. The shipping was very fast, and it came in nice packaging. The product works very well. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks since I bought it, and there&#x27;s still a lot left.&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with acne, and problems with my pores being clogged, along with black heads, and so on, and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All acne medications have failed me, along with their acne washes.  I bought this at my local CVS for a \\&quot;Why the hell not?\\&quot; type of thing, thinking that it would at least make my face feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this, and with in the second day, I saw a noticeably difference in my acne.  By the second day, almost all of it was gone.  I was happy, I was ecstatic about it, as I finally found something that worked!  By the end of the first week, all my acne was gone, from using this alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I ran out, and I had an acne scrub that was supposed to be great for acne, yea, its great for acne, great for making you get Acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have any issues with Acne, get this.  As for the smell I read in some reviews, I like.  It opens up my nasal passages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make your face feel cool, clean, and moisturized at the end of the shower as well.</li>
    <li> In my experience, Nivea is one of the best products for skin care. However, I was greatly disappointed after trying this wash.  My main complaint is that it dried out my skin terribly.  Maybe my skin is too sensitive, but it took a few days to recover from the redness caused by the wash.  It made my skin blotchy and irritated. Other face washes seem to be more gentle, even ones with medication in them.  However, the smell is pleasant.  Bottom line: I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really good and i like it, i will pay more attention to this shop, everything runs well, hope this one helps</li>
    <li> I love this soap because it is great for skin that can easily dry out. I have looked far and wide for a soap that works as well for my skin as this one.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son to use,  it is with good quality, make face in a good condition after using.</li>
    <li> The good - it cleans your face - very well - and in a way that really gets everything - but without drying out your face, probably better than any other face wash I&#x27;ve used (to be clear, I&#x27;ve probably tried all of the stuff you can buy at Target or Walgreens, if it&#x27;s &amp;#62;$20 a bottle, I don&#x27;t really know anything about it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad - it smells mildly like glue and is somewhat viscous and sticky and hard to get off my face. Also - it&#x27;s less mentholated than other menthol face washes. More menthol would be nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying it because it&#x27;s effective, but I sure wouldn&#x27;t mind if it were more pleasant - you know smelled like tea trees or something and didn&#x27;t feel like Elmer&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Revitalizing face wash!</li>
    <li> not very good as I expected. And the price is a liitle high than that in many stores..but I like this brand...</li>
    <li> Keeps your face invigorating and rejuvenating. Amazing product from Nivea.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with both oily and dry facial skin since my high school years, and finding the right products to deal with them hasn&#x27;t always been easy, particularly for the dry skin issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many products, ranging from cocoa butter to Curel or generic moisturizers; they&#x27;ve helped some, but I hate the cold goopy feeling of the moisturizers -- especially in cool weather -- and I sometimes forget to apply them.  Moreover, I still have to wash my face at least twice a day; if I use regular soap for a long stretch of time I&#x27;ll get these terrible dry skin patches.  Worse, if my skin is red and blotchy from stress, the soap will burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Nivea For Men&#x27;s Double Action Face Wash has proven to be an effective solution to most of my problems.  It is gentle on my sensitive skin and cleans off dirt and oil (I still get oily skin when I&#x27;m stressed, too) without irritating or burning, and if used dilligently and in conjunction with Nivea For Men&#x27;s other products (Exfoliating Scrub, After Shave Balm), the Double Action Face Wash soothes and moisturizes the dreaded red-and-dry patches of skin. In time, those ugly patches start diminishing in size and will eventually vanish.  Even better, its scent is pleasant yet masculine, with none of that heavy soapy smell that lingers for hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d have to make the comment that this Nivea product cleans quite well.  My face is slightly oily around certain areas such as the forehead and around the nose, while the rest of my face dries out.  I get a clean feeling around the oily parts without the drying around the rest of my face.  The scent is also nice, not too strong  and not too light either.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, feel fresh and clean, but after a few weeks i still waiting for see some changes on my face skin.</li>
    <li> I have a small acne problem and i have tried other brands of face wash with little to no results. I bought this skeptical it would work, boy did it ever. i have used it for about a month every day and my face is clearer than it was before. I will be sticking with this brand in the future and from this vendor as well</li>
    <li> I been using it and it works fine. Nothing out of the ordinary. If you are looking a face wash, I recommend using this Nivea for Men Moisturizing Face Wash with Menthol.</li>
    <li> I use this for acne and it&#x27;s the best stuff out there for me.  I will be buying more but hopefully at a better price somewhere else.  The shipping took nearly two weeks. Terrible. But love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: you can find this stuff at Target now for cheap. Buy it there instead of waiting for this crazy long shipping.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only brand Face Wash I have ever used. I love it.</li>
    <li> You can feel and see the difference when you use this.  I was kind of skeptical when I first tried it but I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  Give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I used it for two weeks and it does have effects. But it is not so worth. The price is a little high.</li>
