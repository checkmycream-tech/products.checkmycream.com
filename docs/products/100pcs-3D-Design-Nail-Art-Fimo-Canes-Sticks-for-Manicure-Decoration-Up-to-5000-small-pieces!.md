      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I am happy with how fast I received the product.</li>
      <li>I got a pretty good variety and only about 10-15 duplicate canes which is awesome :)</li>
      <li>you are super skilled) in order to get the most out of each cane.</li>
      <li>Awesome products, just wish it was a little quicker ship time</li>
      <li>I sent these to my daughter to get her back into the joy of creating again.</li>
      <li>but thanks anyway!!!</li>
      <li>but other then that I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>They looks very very nice they do not come with glue but a very sharp  sharpl nife Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>Product as described and shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>Purchased from Lucky Electronics in Hong Kong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to cut and apply, exactly what I wanted as my first Fimo purchase.</li>
      <li>I got a nice assortment of different canes.</li>
      <li>But again, they are so short that I am going to have to become really handy with the blade to get any use out of these.</li>
      <li>Handy little easy to use decorations for nails.</li>
      <li>The sticks are pretty short, maybe 2 inches each at most.</li>
      <li>I would recommend the extra buck or two to get the better selection.</li>
      <li>Love these...for that extra nail flare</li>
      <li>I had no idea that I would receive so many duplicate canes- lots and lots of extra lemons and limes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but after I reread the order and measured them, they were exactly what they said they were.</li>
      <li>Some of them are a bit distorted because of their size, but considering you get so many, it&#x27;s really no big deal.</li>
      <li>The sticks were smaller than I expected, but I was pleased they weren&#x27;t huge since they wouldn&#x27;t fit on a nail.</li>
      <li>Some people got good selections, so if you&#x27;re going to buy, just choose a different vendor than Digital Centers.</li>
      <li>Plenty of designs to keep a healthy rotation of easy nail art for a long long while.</li>
      <li>It really meet my expectations. .</li>
      <li>I really recommended....</li>
      <li>..love it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much</li>
      <li>You really get what you pay for in this case.</li>
      <li>I will reorder when needed, thanks again</li>
      <li>But all in all this is a nice set with very few doubles.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s been studying too hard and working too many jobs to NOT keep creating the cools stuff she makes!</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are a few cute designs in this set.  </li>
      <li>wow.  </li>
      <li>The few cute designs that I would use, I only got one or two of.</li>
      <li>There are a few sweet bears and cupcakes.  </li>
      <li>such a low price, I can&#x27;t complain much, but</li>
      <li>Compared to the other canes I have received for the same price, this batch wasn&#x27;t worth the five dollars.</li>
      <li>Just wish I could pick exactly what designs I want as a little over 1/2 of them</li>
      <li>They are easy to slice thin yourself using a razor or exacto blade.</li>
      <li>Some of the canes were broken &amp; some of them when you went to cut them kind of crumbled and slit in half</li>
      <li>THEY ARE SUPER SMALL!</li>

<li> THEY ARE SUPER SMALL!</li>
<li> it was supposed to be here a long time ago</li>
<li> so I split them up  or cut them in half and gave near half to my mom, who also loves nail art.</li>
<li> Only wish it was a little bit longer</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve gone ahead and spent a little extra on the MASH set.  </li>
<li> Took almost a month to arrive, but I expected that.  </li>
<li> but only one size so I would recamend like small nails.</li>
<li> but I was kinda disappointed with the fact that I got like 12 of one of style I wish there had been more variety</li>
<li> No cane in the entire batch is longer than 1 inch, which will make cutting them very hard(unless</li>
<li> I thought they would be a bit bigger, and they are kinda hard to use.</li>
<li> they look like they may be hard to cut though, and they are very tiny.</li>
<li> They arrived loose in a small ziploc baggie.  </li>
<li> was expecting them a little longer, but</li>
<li> There were a few duplicates in my bundle</li>
<li> if you cut them thin enough they do stay on nails for a bit.</li>
<li> like them waste of money</li>
<li> not a lot of repeats and even a few that I hadn&#x27;t seen before.</li>
<li> There are a few \\&quot;what is THAT?\\&quot; canes.  </li>
<li> The only one that was messed up was a green angry bird.</li>
<li> I did have some duplicates but not many.</li>
<li> Im not sure why?</li>
<li> packaged in a small boxed with bubble wrap.</li>
<li> Mine came from Digital Centers and was a very poor selection.</li>
<li> I got 10 each of three particular (ugly) designs.</li>
<li> Seriously.  </li>
<li> I have to say that I was not very impressed with this batch of canes.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;m really disappointed that I received 55 dupes out of 100 canes!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really liked the fact that the product is exactly as described, good colors and shapes. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting them a little longer, but I realize after all is for nails. Im a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Still haven&#x27;t figured out how to use these.  Did not come with instructions, but they are very interesting and excited to try them...once I know how.  Quickest shipping EVER.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I sent these to my daughter to get her back into the joy of creating again. She&#x27;s been studying too hard and working too many jobs to NOT keep creating the cools stuff she makes!</li>
    <li> it was supposed to be here a long time ago and I have not seen it.There is also not tracking information so I do not know where it is.</li>
    <li> I bought these sticks for my nail art. 100 pieces! There were a few duplicates in my bundle so I split them up  or cut them in half and gave near half to my mom, who also loves nail art. They are easy to slice thin yourself using a razor or exacto blade. Plenty of designs to keep a healthy rotation of easy nail art for a long long while.</li>
    <li> these are incredibly cute, i got tons of fruits leaves flowers and animals. they look like they may be hard to cut though, and they are very tiny. But after practice im sure these will be easy and very cute!</li>
    <li> They looks very very nice they do not come with glue but a very sharp  sharpl nife Thanks!!! I really recommended....</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! it&#x27;s just there are multiples of a lot of the fimo canes. :)yeah so that&#x27;s it. YEAH</li>
    <li> I have to say that I was not very impressed with this batch of canes. I ordered several canes from different vendors at the same time and this selection just does not match the quality of the others. No cane in the entire batch is longer than 1 inch, which will make cutting them very hard(unless you are super skilled) in order to get the most out of each cane. The selection of designs was okay....not a lot of repeats and even a few that I hadn&#x27;t seen before. But again, they are so short that I am going to have to become really handy with the blade to get any use out of these. Compared to the other canes I have received for the same price, this batch wasn&#x27;t worth the five dollars. I would not order from this company in the future.</li>
    <li> I love my fimo canes ^_^ been wanting them since I saw everyone on YouTube using em. I got a pretty good variety and only about 10-15 duplicate canes which is awesome :)</li>
    <li> I got a nice assortment of different canes. They cut really nicely and look great. I did have some duplicates but not many.</li>
    <li> I am happy with how fast I received the product. They were smaller then I thought they&#x27;d be but after I reread the order and measured them, they were exactly what they said they were. I did receive 2 extras and a blade that I wasn&#x27;t expecting. There were some multiples though, wish there weren&#x27;t any multiples but other then that I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> It really meet my expectations. . I loved it.. I will definitely recommend it. Only wish it was a little bit longer so I could of share it with my sisther</li>
    <li> I have ordered may fimo&#x27;s and while some were smaller thank I may have liked but all in all it was a great produce, and I would order again.</li>
    <li> No! I don&#x27;t  like them waste of money</li>
    <li> I thought they would be a bit bigger, and they are kinda hard to use. But great assortment. but only one size so I would recamend like small nails.</li>
    <li> The sticks were smaller than I expected, but I was pleased they weren&#x27;t huge since they wouldn&#x27;t fit on a nail. I received a few different colored cat faces, fruits, butterflies, hearts, leaves, practically a whole batch of the cutest designs ever. I thankfully didn&#x27;t receive any smiley faces (since I would never use them) and only got one stick that I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about (it was a girl).     All in all I can&#x27;t wait to apply them to my nails.</li>
    <li> I thought they would be bigger/longer given the pic that i saw. All of them came and none were damaged and I didn&#x27;t see any repeats. but I only passed through them. Hopefully they will work well when I use them. none of them were defective. came in a baggie with a rubber band. packaged in a small boxed with bubble wrap. if you cut them thin enough they do stay on nails for a bit. otherwise will get caught in hair, caught on clothes, etc..</li>
    <li> The sticks are pretty short, maybe 2 inches each at most. Some of them are a bit distorted because of their size, but considering you get so many, it&#x27;s really no big deal. They are very cute and the quality is not bad. The blade they come with cuts them well.</li>
    <li> Love these...for that extra nail flare</li>
    <li> I was happy with the quality of my product but I was kinda disappointed with the fact that I got like 12 of one of style I wish there had been more variety</li>
    <li> Love them they are so easy to cut, and apply, the color is great in them and love all the designs.</li>
    <li> $o cute! My daughter slices them &amp; uses them for her clay creations. THEY ARE SUPER SMALL! Great 4 price!</li>
    <li> I didnt know about this product&lt;br /&gt;..im in school and to make my nails look even beautiful..love it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much</li>
    <li> Some of the canes were broken &amp; some of them when you went to cut them kind of crumbled and slit in half Im not sure why? Also I didnt get what was pictured which was upsetting. I can &amp; have used some already &amp; will continue to because I bought them. If you are selling something Id suggest specifying which ones are being sent...</li>
    <li> Handy little easy to use decorations for nails. Very easy to cut with a razor blade. Just wish I could pick exactly what designs I want as a little over 1/2 of them I do not like.</li>
    <li> Product as described and shipped quickly. Easy to cut and apply, exactly what I wanted as my first Fimo purchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome products, just wish it was a little quicker ship time but thanks anyway!!! I will reorder when needed, thanks again</li>
    <li> I didnt get some of the ones I wanted in the picture (frog, hello kitty, flag, blue bear, dragonfly). But all in all this is a nice set with very few doubles. The only one that was messed up was a green angry bird.</li>
    <li> Mine came from Digital Centers and was a very poor selection. There were many duplicates. I got 10 each of three particular (ugly) designs. The few cute designs that I would use, I only got one or two of. Some people got good selections, so if you&#x27;re going to buy, just choose a different vendor than Digital Centers. If you get a good selection, please post the vendor name to help others. I also ordered this set [[ASIN:B005C5FP9Y Premium MASH 100 Pc Nail Art Nailart 3d Manicure Design Sticks Rods Stickers Gel Tips]] from Mash Nails, fulfilled by Amazon and it was a great selection with no duplicates. I would recommend the extra buck or two to get the better selection.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these</li>
    <li> Yes, I received 100 Fimo canes.  They arrived loose in a small ziploc baggie.  Took almost a month to arrive, but I expected that.  Purchased from Lucky Electronics in Hong Kong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m really disappointed that I received 55 dupes out of 100 canes!  I had no idea that I would receive so many duplicate canes- lots and lots of extra lemons and limes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few cute designs in this set.  I posted a pic of what arrived in my shipment. *Since Amazon is allowing sellers to remove user-posted images, I&#x27;ve included the link to the photo in the comments section of this review.*  There are a few sweet bears and cupcakes.  There is even a nice blue circle with a snowman on it- perfect for the upcoming holidays.  There are a few \\&quot;what is THAT?\\&quot; canes.  One looks like a scrotum.  Seriously.  Maybe someone can comment on my photo to tell me what it is supposed to be.  I&#x27;m stumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For such a low price, I can&#x27;t complain much, but wow.  I&#x27;ve gone ahead and spent a little extra on the MASH set.  You really get what you pay for in this case.</li>
