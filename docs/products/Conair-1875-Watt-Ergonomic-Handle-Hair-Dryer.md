      <li>The pics on Amazon appeared (to me anyway) to look more like a compact hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>Dryer itself works ok.</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>Again, better, faster.  </li>

      <li>It is light weight and has dual settings.</li>
      <li>The unit is extremely light and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>and the best thing I like is to have a 3 level mode high - low - medium</li>
      <li>I bought this item because it was cheap and it had a cool setting.  </li>
      <li>Ok if it&#x27;s for your own personal use.</li>

      <li>pretty good product, low noise, will buy again</li>
      <li>Out of curiosity, she used mine and came to me surprised about how better it was at drying.</li>
      <li>but overall it&#x27;s nice</li>
      <li>This hairdryer is not as powerful as I was expecting.</li>
      <li>You can make it blow cool or hot.</li>
      <li>Good, dry fast, except for the size!</li>
      <li>Blows hot and dries my hair fast, affordable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I am giving this hair dryer 5 stars for being so amazingly simple!&lt;br /&gt;There are no frills or cool settings (Low, High, Cool)</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and blows hot air....</li>
      <li>The price is right.</li>
      <li>Effective but not as good as the broken one I love for the same brand.</li>
      <li>On this dryer, the cool setting has its own position so you can just lock it in and blow cool air wherever you want (usually at your head).</li>
      <li>The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s huge!  </li>
      <li>so I got exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>My first Conair dryer lasted about 30 years.</li>
      <li>Hot is one notch below it.</li>
      <li>The hot setting is a bit hot (but aren&#x27;t they all?)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Would have preferred a stronger airflow</li>
    <li> Item as described. High heat, low heat, and cool settings. Product works exactly as it is supposed to with no problems at all. Simplicity at its finest! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: September, 2013 - Still works great!</li>
    <li> Hair dryer works perfectly HIGHLY RECCOMEND</li>
    <li> This dryer is a bit larger than I expected but is very lightweight. I have a couple minor issues : there is no &#x27;loop&#x27; attached to hang up the dryer and the cord is about a foot too short for my taste. It DOES dry my hair however, so all in all, it does the job.</li>
    <li> I’ve had it for over a year and it works just fine.  This is a simple dryer that does the job.</li>
    <li> I like this little hair dryer; it is small, lightweight and easy to use. The controls are in a good place and it does a good job. I only gave it four stars because even on low it blows pretty hard and is hotter than I would like it to be. For the price, it was a good enough deal.</li>
    <li> This little baby is quite the trooper. Blows hard and hot. A hard worker and compact, always ready to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could I would marry it.</li>
    <li> Light weight but not too powerful</li>
    <li> its cheap and best. works well. and the best thing I like is to have a 3 level mode high - low - medium</li>
    <li> It looks nice and quiet and cheap. I only used for a short time. but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;every one at my home also like it.</li>
    <li> This is the basic dryer, nothing fancy.  There are no special attachments and it doesn&#x27;t have as much power as lots of other hair dryers.  They are all noisy and this is no exception.  Whereas my hair requires so little maintenance, this dryer meets my needs.  Plus it&#x27;s small, and that&#x27;s what I like about it.</li>
    <li> good price and product is good</li>
    <li> It dries my hair well.  The cord is a bit short, but no problem if you have an outlet at sink level.  It&#x27;s also a little weird that the off setting isn&#x27;t on one end of the slider, but it didn&#x27;t bother me once I got used to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude so hair dryers aren&#x27;t my thing but I will say this: this thing rocks. It&#x27;s super powerful and my favorite feature is that you don&#x27;t have to hold down a button to activate the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting. On this dryer, the cool setting has its own position so you can just lock it in and blow cool air wherever you want (usually at your head).</li>
    <li> Worked fine for a little over a year and then died. It was not used daily - maybe once a week.</li>
    <li> Picture is very deceiving, the hair dryer is bigger than the pic. However, good quality for the price, and I get great use out of it.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair, but this dries it in no time.</li>
    <li> We purchased for our granddaughter and she loves this item. Easily handled, classy color and design and has power to blow the hair dry. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> The lady that cuts my hair suggested that I get a hairdryer to help with styling.  I wanted something cheap and easy to use.  This was perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had pixie short hair that dried in 5 minutes for most of my adult life. But since I&#x27;ve decided to grow my hair out, it has taken forever to dry. I wanted a hair dryer that was fool-proof and unintimidating and this product definitely delivered. It has 4 settings: cold, high, low, off which are pretty self-explanatory. Seriously, any newbie can operate this. Now I wake up with perfectly set hair because I&#x27;m able to dry and semi-style it in the evening before I go to sleep, with a little argan or sweet almond oil on my scalp as a heat protectant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have complained that the &#x27;cool&#x27; setting is not cool enough, but I actually like that. I don&#x27;t like using the hot settings too often for fear of ruining my hair, but cold air would be difficult to deal with in cold weather.</li>
    <li> Love it.. small hands and it is very good and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> all hair dryers should have just the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; air function.  I like it, others like it the cool air is powerful and I think it does not make my hair fall off. get it.</li>
    <li> Great dryer for the price.  I was looking for a dryer with a cool setting and not just the cool blast button.  This one have the cool setting which is great when you&#x27;re looking to minimize using heat on your hair</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is not as powerful as I was expecting. But it eventually gets the job done. My main complaint is that if you slide the on/off button all the way to the top it is &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; not hot. Hot is one notch below it. I guess this is helpful if you switch between hot and cold a lot, but it is just a little annoyance in my morning that I do not need.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the easiest to use and its affordable and the most hassle free dryer but def not a pro styler!</li>
    <li> Just great. . And compacted.  A lot of power&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t over heat... great for the price and for first time users</li>
    <li> Great dryer for the money! If your in need of a dryer with a bit of umpth but won&#x27;t put a dent in your wallet, then this dryer is the one for you.</li>
    <li> Still going strong and I use it daily</li>
    <li> Pretty much what you&#x27;d expect for the price.  It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; dryer.</li>
    <li> Dryer itself works ok. Packaging is horrible. It came in a broken box and a tangled unraveled cord. Not suitable for a gift. Ok if it&#x27;s for your own personal use.</li>
    <li> Dryer functions as advertised.  It is larger than I expected which makes it a little bulky.  The handle is thin compared to body size.  Those are the only reasons I could not give it 5 stars.  Has all the features I need at a good price.</li>
    <li> Good, dry fast, except for the size! It is too big to take it on travel~ it can&#x27;t be folded.</li>
    <li> Best dryer I have ever purchased!!  Very lightweight so I can use it for travel and it works GREAT!!  My original dryer weighs a ton and makes it hard to travel so I love this dryer,</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t put a lot of fuss into my hair, but recently we moved to a much different climate (hot and humid). Since I didn&#x27;t want to wait all day for my hair to mostly dry, I wanted to pick up a cheap hair dryer. For the price, this one is fantastic. The hot setting is a bit hot (but aren&#x27;t they all?) but the cool setting is really strong, so I use that most often. For all the power it puts out, the dryer is small too, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to make a complaint, it would be that the cord could be longer, and it isn&#x27;t coiled so it doesn&#x27;t stretch at all.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t normally use one at home but on the road we do so we really don&#x27;t expect a lot. Good for saving time and is gets hot enough for even thick hair and doesn&#x27;t sound like a jet taking off.</li>
    <li> The blue part is actually a little bit dark than shown on the pic, but I&#x27;m okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;The power is strong, just what I want.</li>
    <li> Quality product that is simple to use. Good price.  My mother would be proud that I&#x27;m using a hair dryer before I go out in the cold :).</li>
    <li> Product was great &amp; it does its job perfect! Cluldnt been more happy :)</li>
    <li> Not very hot and not very strong.  I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much for ten bucks but at least a little more umph!  Not fabulous but a get what you pay for my toddler doesn&#x27;t run away from it kind of deal that&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars.  She is 2 and doesn&#x27;t mind on high it blowing in her face some!</li>
    <li> For about $12 you couldn&#x27;t go wrong. Arrived quickly and blows hot air....what more could one want? So much better than e-bay!</li>
    <li> I am giving this hair dryer 5 stars for being so amazingly simple!&lt;br /&gt;There are no frills or cool settings (Low, High, Cool) just basic user-friendly hair drying action.&lt;br /&gt;CAN I TELL YOU THIS THING LASTS! I&#x27;ve had mine for about 7 years now and works like the day i got it!&lt;br /&gt;Just do yourself a favor and unscrew the back every now and then and clean the lint out of the filter (wire mesh on back)</li>
    <li> Other reviews indicate the advertising was in error as the unit did NOT include a\\&quot;cool\\&quot; slection.  The one we received DID have this. The unit is extremely light and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This was a present. It works very well and it a great hair dryer for the price. I rec it</li>
    <li> would recommend this for anyone, works great, runs fine and is perfect for what I needed it for. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this nice piece</li>
    <li> Basic hair dryers for a WM price.  Why stand in line when you can get on Amazon for the same price?  I bought one for each bathroom in a rental property.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> This dryer works as well as any I have ever used, and being in my 60&#x27;s, that is quite a few!  It works great and didn&#x27;t cost more than I was prepared to pay.  So far, so good, I have only had it for about a month or so, and use it daily.  I would definitely recommend this one to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick update... been using this drying since May and it still works great.  No problems.</li>
    <li> I have just purchased my second hair dryer of this model and am thinking about ordering another as a backup to have on hand.  I love it!  This is why:  1. On high it does not blow as forcefully as many other dryers of the same wattage, which for me works better, and faster.  On low, I think it blows a bit harder than low on other dryers, at least the other drier I have and don&#x27;t use. Again, better, faster.  2.  It is simple; high, low, cool.  No fancy attachment (that I throw away or have to store), no fancy features, it just works well.  3.  The price is right. I do not believe I would get more benefit from a $200 model.  Simple, basic and works well.  My only disappointment is that my last dryer of this model only lasted about 2 years.  I would hope for more longevity.  My first Conair dryer lasted about 30 years.</li>
    <li> pretty good product, low noise, will buy again. pretty good product, low noise, will buy again. pretty good product, low noise, will buy again</li>
    <li> Dryer is light weight but powerful. A lot of hair dryer for the price. I&#x27;m 6 ft tall and it would be nice if the cord was just a little longer.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer for a low price;  I have 2 of these dryers;  They easily fit into a gym bag, get the job done and is very simple to operate;  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this dryer</li>
    <li> The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s huge!  The pics on Amazon appeared (to me anyway) to look more like a compact hair dryer.  It&#x27;s not.  It won&#x27;t even fit in the drawer of my sink base!  Having said that, the reason I like it the most is that is has an &#x27;air&#x27; setting.  I don&#x27;t need blazing hot or cold..so this is a good choice for that.  My only other complaint, as it were..is that the bottom setting of the switch should be &#x27;off&#x27;.  It&#x27;s not.  They have &#x27;off&#x27; one up from the bottom.  News to me.  I thought all hand held dryers had off on the bottom.</li>
    <li> Great dryer and a great price.  Quiet and gets the job done. I had a Conair that was 6 years old that I used every day and it finally bit the dust. With that kind of reputation it was easy to know what brand to pick.</li>
    <li> Great deal! I bought this as an add on product for just under $10. It works really well. It has a little less power than the blow dryer that I was using before, but it still gets the job done. Overall, it was money well-spent.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re just looking for a $10 appliance that sometimes blows air, hot or cold, this is the one for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except when trying out the other settings, I only ever use this on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; (warm). Most of the time I have to shake it to get it to turn on. Once it does, there is about a 50/50 chance of it blowing hot/cold air. Once it is on and blowing air, the speed changes from high to low, low to high, back and forth seemingly randomly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also arrived used and repackaged even though I bought new. There was a burn mark on the side. Clearly whoever had it before me had better judgement in returning it, because I was too lazy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you really don&#x27;t care about buying a crap appliance that will probably stop working in a few months, if it ever did at all, spend $5-10 more and treat yourself to a decent hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Does the job at an unbeatable price! I have very thick Romanian long straight hair and this dries my hair well and pretty fast. Great product and would buy again if I had to.</li>
    <li> I got this blower for ME...&#x27;cause I dry my hair using the cool setting only and wanted big air on that setting-this bad boy delivers... Only (minor) item is that this guy is pretty big..so if you&#x27;re traveling, etc. and space will be at a premium you may want to reconsider, but I really like this thing.. Cord is a decent length also. Recommended.</li>
    <li> The only reason I have this four stars is because the only problem I have with it is that it isn&#x27;t as powerful as my last dryer, which was different, but for the money I spent I got every penny. It works just fine and I love how you don&#x27;t have to press an additional button to go to the cool setting like old dryer.</li>
    <li> I ordered the dryer and had it shipped to my father&#x27;s house back east to use for my visit.  It arrived in approximately 3 days and I did not see it until I went for my visit.  It is lightweight and is AWESOME.  I was going to leave it at Dad&#x27;s house but it is so nice, I brought it back home!!</li>
    <li> The high power is about a mid between low and what should be high.  Takes much longer to dry my hair with this.  I would not purchase this again even though it was priced low.</li>
    <li> It dries better than the more expensive brands. My girlfriend was visiting and she brought her &amp;#60;some other brand name&amp;#62; hair dryer, which ran around 30 dollars. Out of curiosity, she used mine and came to me surprised about how better it was at drying. Guess you can&#x27;t trust prices with beauty products. Go wild, people.</li>
    <li> I had a hair dryer like this before so I got exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a primary hair dryer. My hair is thin but I have lots of it. It goes to a little below my chin and almost to my shoulders. I needed a replacement dryer after my previous one died, but I am on this cost-savings mission and so I wanted to get one for as little money as possible.  Therefore, I went on Amazon and did a search for dryers with 4+ star ratings and then sorted by price. This was the cheapest of the 4 star rating at the time of my search, which was maybe a few months ago.  I like this dryer. It does what it advertises. It is light weight and has dual settings. You can make it blow cool or hot. I have found though that it does take longer to dry my hair with this dryer than with more expensive ones.  So, while I do like this dryer, I think I would prefer a more expensive high powered model when my hair grows longer.  For people with short hair or sparse hair or guys with crew cuts, I think this would be useful. For the price, this was very good.</li>
    <li> Really nice hair dryer.  I love the cold setting and it is not a puny amount of air!  Does a nice job and is easy to use.  Not too clunky or loud.  I like it.</li>
    <li> For cost, these things still have not broken or stopped working.</li>
    <li> I do wish the cold shot button was colder and the blower was stronger but overall it&#x27;s nice and when I use it, it does well enough.</li>
    <li> For this price, this is a very good product. Light weight. Go for it before the deal goes off. :)</li>
    <li> Blows hot and dries my hair fast, affordable and easy to use. Just plug and use. The color sucks but there was no other color for this type so it will do.</li>
    <li> The thing that you put in front isn&#x27;t their!!! and every time i try to use it it blow half of my hair the other half is flying up!!! hate it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item because it was cheap and it had a cool setting.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this hair dryer.  Now if only I could be pleased with my Hair...  :)</li>
    <li> nice dryer, yet wish I had alittle more power.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, its good for me with short hair!!! works great</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is pretty good for the price.  As other reviewers have said, it takes a bit of getting used to the position of the buttons, but other than that I have no problems with it.  I like the relatively small size and weight of this dryer.</li>
    <li> Effective but not as good as the broken one I love for the same brand. It is not hot enough.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband so he would stop stealing mine.  It&#x27;s great for what he needs it to do.</li>
