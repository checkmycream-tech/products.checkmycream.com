<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE IT! I honestly thought, because of how dark my hair was, I would have to go through many bleach sessions. But this ... saves me time, money and the extra hair damage. Had I discovered this product sooner, I&#x27;d of saved my hair some grief, years ago. Do not use it in a small enclosed room, though. Makes sure there some sort of air ventilation or at least some breathing room. Strong smell when combined with the developer. Also, if you&#x27;re going to use it on your roots, keep track of your time. Any burning sensation you begin to feel, wash it off. ( This applies to any product ) Do your research and seek expert/professional advice. Strand test is best.</li>
    <li> good on its own for a dirty blonde look cause not all of it takes but it is a great first step because all the red dye i used a week later took beautifully</li>
    <li> It works great for resistent hair, but there is hardly any bleach powder. Unless your hair is super short, you would do better to go to your local beauty supply and get a bottle of 30- or 40-volume developer and either a warm or cool bleach. Keep in mind that 40-volume can absolutely wreck some people&#x27;s hair. Drug-store dyes and lighteners usually use 20-volume developer.</li>
    <li> Came amazingly quick in the mail, best bleach I&#x27;ve ever used. Really effective, got a nice fair blonde.</li>
    <li> got my product earlier than expected. awesome swrvicr</li>
    <li> does the job! I use before pastel or bright dye. :)</li>
    <li> No negative comments about this!</li>
    <li> Well, i purchased this product because&lt;br /&gt;1) too lazy to drive to the store&lt;br /&gt;2) wasn&#x27;t even sure if i wanted to bleach my hair or not (the mailing time gave me time to decide)&lt;br /&gt;3) i had used Splat bleach before and hated it, and had heard nothing but good things of manic panic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the product arrived and i was excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Now, this is NOT something to buy if you plan on doing your whole head (i&#x27;d go with blue lightning or something else besides this) it does however say in the description how little you are getting so i&#x27;m not sure why people are still complaining. I knew beforehand i only want to bleach a small section on my hair, so i only used about half of what i got which is great because i can bleach it again if desired.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strong (of course it is, it&#x27;s bleach!) but it lifted my hair color quickly. i have dyed black hair and natural dark brown hair, within 10 minutes my hair was lightened to a light brown, and 10 minutes after that was going into a blonde. all together i left it in for 30 minutes and am very happy with the results, no toner needed for me</li>
    <li> They word about Manic Panic is spot on. Even with bleaching my hair it was still soft and hydrated instead of straw and stiff and brittle like other brands have done to my hair. I will definately use them for now on. I left it on for like 2hrs to make sure it was blonder than I usually do from the product burning my sclap, nothing was wrong with it. It felt fine for me and my senstitve skin.</li>
    <li> I Havent tried it yet but I just found out its cheaper at sally&#x27;s beauty supply [...] So Check it out here. I heard this product is super good i can&#x27;t wait for it to come in the mail</li>
    <li> I have hair up to my shoulders and there was not enough product,it came out really well though, just needs more product! :)</li>
    <li> I actually used this to bleach a deer skull.  Did what it needed to do and it worked well.  The european mount looks awesome.</li>
    <li> Great product! Shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> So easy and effective. Hair stays healthy no matter how long it&#x27;s processed.</li>
    <li> Best bleach I&#x27;ve used in a while. I already have light hair but still have problems with bleach. Really shouldn&#x27;t be so hard to get my hair to white but this product got it in 2 bleaches. Right on</li>
    <li> the directions is plain and simple , i used this product the day i got it , and it works like it said , i had dark brown to redish hair and it turned blonde less then 30 mins . but all hair types are different , but i love this product and i will continue too in the future , thanks .</li>
    <li> Though I was a bit leery about buying this product it turned out to be worth it. I first ordered my product July 22, 2011. They said the product would be here by July 27, 2011 and it came on the morning of July 24th/25th. Either way, the shipping was extremely fast. When I got it, I opened the box to check if everything was inside, I noticed a lot of people was complaining about not getting gloves but I did in fact get mines. One thing I noticed about this product, the actual bleaching items in the box isn&#x27;t much. The bleaching powder is like 1.34 oz (38 grams) and the developing cream is like 4 Fl Oz (118 ml) I honestly do believe that their is more developer in the box than bleaching powder. Though I do have some of both left over, (due to me only doing the back of my hair and a side highlight).. I DO NOT recommend you buy this if you are considering doing your whole head unless you plan to get two boxes of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the product:&lt;br /&gt;I did use the product on myself.&lt;br /&gt;My hair color is damn near pitch black so I had to leave it in &amp; though I thought leaving it in longer was going to dry my hair out, it didn&#x27;t! I didn&#x27;t leave the bleach in long enough so it turned out orange, so I did bleach it a 2nd time in the same day. Still didn&#x27;t dry my hair out. I didn&#x27;t want my hair completely blonde so I stopped when it got to like a honey blondish. (: After bleaching, I washed my hair with conditioner let it air dry (cause my hair is curly) and it came out wonderfully. I know some people say that you&#x27;re supposed to condition your hair a lot more than you would usually do it after you bleach your hair, but I personally don&#x27;t? I still do my same routine, and my hair still doesn&#x27;t get dried out or F&#x27;d up. (i do not recommend doing what I do though, seeing as all hair types are not the same).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So once again this product is EXCELLENT. And I do recommend it for beginners trying to bleach or Highlight their hair. (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thanks for reading &amp; feel free to ask any questions. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xoxo,caliions. :)     xoxo,cali</li>
    <li> This is incredibly damaging, worse than the stuff that comes in Splat boxes. And trust me, that stuff is BAD. I had incredibly healthy hair when I purchased this, and when I got out of the shower after washing it out my hair was stringy and dried to a straw-like texture. Not to mention you don&#x27;t get that much product, and the smell is killer. Not only that, but the &amp;#34;Pale lemon yellow&amp;#34; color the label says it will bring your hair to is actually just short of neon yellow. So you&#x27;ll end up toning your hair two or three times to bring it to a decent shade to color over (If you&#x27;re going blonde or something).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a decent job lifting only if your hair is virgin or already on the lighter or ashier spectrum of hair colors. Considering 40 vol is the most powerful bleach you can really get, this doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as other bleaches I&#x27;ve used and is three to four times more damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of experience with bleaching, lifting and coloring my own hair and this was easily the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Well... It worked very well... My hair had so pink on it when I put the bleach in and there was still a pink tint to my hair even after bleached</li>
    <li> if you have dark hair, this is the one to use. worked great on my already dyed hair. BUT this kills your hair. so unless you know how to kind of safely protect your hair, i don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> This product works like magic I thought at first that it wouldn&#x27;t work because of the reviews it had gotten</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions correctly, it works great. You can go from a dark brown to a light blonde. But your hair will be beyond damaged. I used to bleach my hair all the time in high school. And then dye it all kinds of crazy colors. Now I&#x27;m all natural and I won&#x27;t even use hair spray.</li>
    <li> I did not have good results with this bleach it was very yellow and spotty normally 40 volume bleach gets it almost white.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American and have permed hair but I haven&#x27;t permed my hair in a while. I wanted to add a little color to my hair and I was so scared that it would damage it and make my hair stretchy and weak because I watched Youtube videos on different people and their turnouts but...this bleach kit WORKS. As soon as I put this mixture on my hair, I noticed my hair change color within 45 seconds of application. I honestly thought I would need a purple toner or purple shampoo to get the yellow tones out of my bleached hair but I bleached it twice and after the second time my hair was still strong and even lighter then the first application. I have no complaints at all this stuff really works! Wish I could post a picture.</li>
    <li> This kit specifies that gloves come with it. I bought two and neither box had gloves! Along with that, when I received the box, the product leaked and the inside was covered with cream. I wish I had bought this in person, but none of my local Sally&#x27;s had volume 40.</li>
    <li> The bottle with developer was broken when I got it and developer was all over the box. Like half of the bottle leaked out.</li>
    <li> I see in other reviews that they too were missing gloves when their product arrived, and the same is true for me. I had to go to the store to buy some. However, the product itself works wonders on my hair. It&#x27;s a great product. It just would have been nice to have the gloves included in the box so I didn&#x27;t have to spend more money. I needed to do my hair as soon as I received the product, so I didn&#x27;t bother going through the hassle of sending it back, getting a new one, and/or having the company mail me gloves. I am not sure how gloves can be missing from the box, but I guess I am not the only one this has happens to.</li>
    <li> I have medium brown hair and was bleaching it myself for the first time with the intent of dying it teal. I didn&#x27;t time it and just kept an eye on the progress as I went along, just checking in on it every ten minutes or so. Very effective and it&#x27;s worth the money for the extra tools it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 4/5 stars because, at least in my case, you definitely need to use a toner afterwards to get some of the yellow tinge out if you&#x27;re a brunette. That&#x27;s pretty much how any bleach would behave though. I used manic panic snow for this purpose and it&#x27;s definitely a good investment as you don&#x27;t need much and it&#x27;s essential if you&#x27;re really intent on getting the most intense end result possible.</li>
    <li> I have very dark almost black hair, and flash lightning took it to a nice light blonde color in record time! The only problem I have with the kit is that there wasn&#x27;t enough stuff in it for my whole head, and I had to go out and buy another kit. If you have short hair, it&#x27;d be perfect, but I have long hair so I should&#x27;ve seen it coming :3 other than that, NO complaints what so ever!!</li>
    <li> Worked nicely, I have very dark brown hair and it did exactly what I wanted it to.</li>
    <li> This bleach works wonderfully. I was able to bring my hair from a medium brown to a very pale yellow by leaving this in for about an hour. The only issue I have with this kit is the amount given. This is definitely not a kit for bleaching your entire head. My hair comes just past my chin, and I only bleach the front and underneath of it. There was -just- enough product in here to get what I needed bleached. If you have longer hair, you&#x27;ll need more than one of these!</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair and it went to a platinum blonde I&#x27;m so impressed with this.</li>
    <li> i have solid black hair and this got me from night black to blonde blonde in under an hour...this is good stuff without the worries of too much chemical burns and it actually leaves your hair really soft after the rinse than brittle.</li>
    <li> Well it says it has gloves and it doesn&#x27;t come with any other than that its a good product. but yea.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bleached my hair before, Yesterday my friend bleached and dyed my hair (Atomic Turqoise), This bleach works wonders..By the way..The Gloves and Cap are in the mixing tub for the bleach..Don&#x27;t fret, haha. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> I used this to bleach my hair from medium-dark brown to blonde so I could dye it to a lighter color. I had only used bleach once before many years ago and was not happy with the results. I was pleasantly surprised that this got a much more even lightning effect. And it did not kill my hair as much as I feared so that was quite good.</li>
    <li> If you are buying this to go with a manic panic toner, I wouldn&#x27;t bother with either. This bleach barely had an effect on my roots, let alone the rest of my hair. I left it on for an hour, which is about as long as you can leave it on before you begin to risk over processing. After that failed attempt, I had my boyfriend go to walmart and get me some Splat bleach, which surprised me by being blue, so it doubled as a very effective toner, and the bleach lightened the undyed parts of my hair to white after one use, and the parts that have been previously dyed took another round of bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: make a trip to walmart instead</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every thing trying to bleach my very dark thick coarse hair to get it past the ridiculous &#x27;orangutan&#x27; orange stage. I always had to settle for highlights never being light enough. Well, let me tell you...this stuff WORKS! Within 25 minutes this bleach kit had lightened my hair enough to use a platinum toner on it so I could get the gray look that&#x27;s so popular now. Didn&#x27;t damage my hair at all. It&#x27;s long (halfway down my back) and I had no breakage or spongy feeling hair! My hairdresser was so surprised. She&#x27;s going to use this on my hair. She told me to just bring it to the salon and she would use this product. I LOVE Manic Panic Flash Lightening bleach kit. I used the 40 but if your hair isn&#x27;t as dark as mine you could use one of the other volumes. This stuff is great!!</li>
    <li> This item shipped in two days, and came with everything necessary for using it. It is VERY VERY strong! Bleaches the darkest hair in less than an hour. The only problem I had with it is when I used it on my bangs, my bangs touched my skin for less than a minute, and it caused a blister. It literally burned my skin. So you MUST be very careful with this product. DO NOT LET IT TOUCH YOUR SKIN.</li>
    <li> I guess it did what it was supposed to, but I still had to bleach my hair twice to get it light enough to dye atomic pink and blue mayhem. I thought that getting the 40vol would keep me from having to bleach twice. In the future I will go to walgreens and buy the Loreal Paris \\&quot;Super Blonde\\&quot; kit for $10 that does the same thing but leaves your hair in better shape. I was sadly not impressed.</li>
    <li> needed two boxes, since my hair is so dark brown and thick. but it is very easy to use and does what it says it will:) helped me to dye my hair a nice seafoam afterwards.</li>
    <li> It worked great taking out the black hair color</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I have dark brown (near black) hair and it lightened up my hair to a pale yellow in about an hour. My hair did not come out straw-like and easy to apply. Though I would recommend getting more gloves (as there is only one pair) and a fine tooth comb to evenly distribute the bleach. Also, I only put 3 broad streaks in my hair and know that one kit would NOT cover a whole head of hair (medium-long length). Otherwise, worked great on me!</li>
    <li> My sister wanted me to dye the tips of her hair blue, which were a mix of medium brown and black. I was able to lighten her hair to a nice pale blonde with this bleach.  Mine did come with the gloves as well as a plastic shower cap. I could not find them at first but they were inside the white tub. Still, I recommend you buy extra gloves.</li>
    <li> It works but if you frequently dye your hair unnatural colors you&#x27;re be teeter off just going to Sally&#x27;s and buying a tub of bleach powder and a bottle of developer</li>
    <li> Works good, didn&#x27;t damage my hair like other bleaches. The smell did make my eyes water, so it&#x27;s better to do it in a open space. I have shoulder length hair and I ran out before I did it all so I recommend buying two.</li>
    <li> waste of money!!!!!!don&#x27;t bother trying it! I was pissed when i saw the results...I thought it would put blonde in my hair but it didn&#x27;t ..</li>
    <li> The packaging was apparently resealed and the box itself was severely damaged. Thankfully the product was fine and I can still use it.&lt;br /&gt;Lucky I didn&#x27;t stab myself opening the damn thing since the sharp end of the dying brush was stabbing out through the packaging. I don&#x27;t normally leave bad reviews, but this was ridiculous. I could have stabbed myself. Product itself is fine.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOD this product is amazing , it will light your color so quick I started with my roots and by the time i ended up all the way to the bottom my roots were already lightened up I had dark brown and kept it only for 15 min , But if your hair can resist and its in good shape you can keep it longer , Overall product works great</li>
    <li> I have dyed black hair and it&#x27;s a pain to bleach it for bright colors. I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun, but Flash Lightning Bleach kit is the only one that took the black out. It took a while to do because of how much black was on my hair from the multiple times from dyeing. It turned my roots a platinum color and the ends reached a banana yellow. 40 volume could probably make all of the hair white.</li>
    <li> This was missing the bowl and gloves advertised on the box, but I can still use the product.  Don&#x27;t recommend purchasing if you do need these items.</li>
    <li> This product did the job eventually but could be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smelled really toxic but that is just a bleach thing I guess. I have significant issues with chemical sensitivities (as part of the severe neurological disease I have called Myalgic Encephalomyelitis - see the HFME site for info on it, if you want to). I got around these by only bleaching and dyeing my hair starting about an inch from the roots - so none of the dyes or bleaches touch the scalp and the skin at all. The rest of my hair is natural brown coloured. I think it looks better not going all the way to the roots, personally. Plus doing it this way avoids all regrowth issues and means I only will have to re-bleach every 4 months or more. Pretty low maintenance blue and violet etc. hair, which is what I was after. I love the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The instructions say to mix the powder and cream using the included tinting brush. But doing this when you&#x27;re mixing a smaller amount of bleach wastes a lot of bleach and also leaves you with an improperly mixed lumpy product. Far better to use something else to mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The amount of product included was surprisingly small. I was only doing my fringe/bangs so it was okay but to do all of my just past shoulder length, quite thick hair, I don&#x27;t know if even 3 boxes of this bleach would have been enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The indents in the mixing bowl make it hard to mix the two ingredients, a flat bowl would be far more practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A resealable bag for the powder is needed. The bag it is in now is very thin and cheap and hard to reseal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included gloves and tint brush were of okay quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all there needs to be far more product for the price. Plus I think the instructions should be clearer about the need to apply the bleach very thickly or else you end up with an uneven and patchy result. Doing a patch test beforehand is useless if you don&#x27;t have the coverage exactly the same when you do the rest of your hair. But this isn&#x27;t even mentioned in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this bleach because it was easiest for me to buy. The name and box design is well done though and I like it. Next time I&#x27;ll be trying another brand for sure. This was disappointing, especially considering the good name of this brand when it comes to their colourful hair dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However you get bleached...I&#x27;d recommend going colourful, in a big way or even only in a small section of hair, to anyone whose job allows it... and especially anyone that is ill or for other reasons just needs or wants a bit of fun and excessive colourfulness. More beautiful and unexpected colour in the world is always a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2014: I have finally worked out that the reason I found this product so hard to mix and that it easily gave a patchy result was that it was too old and what can happen with old bleach powder is that it goes grainy and doesn&#x27;t mix in properly. My box was shipped to me in that condition. Both of them were actually, but the second one worse than the first. No wonder it was all so difficult! I&#x27;ve since found out also that instead of getting under 50 grams of bleach powder with this product, you can buy professional types of bleach powder in 500 grams bags and a separate developer cream to go with it, for about the same price or cheaper! The products are very easy to find and buy online. This product is just unreasonably expensive for so little bleach powder and developer. It&#x27;s a real shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy dyeing everyone!same when you do the rest of your hair. But this isn&#x27;t even mentioned in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this bleach because it was easiest for me to buy. The name and box design is well done though and I like it.

    <li> OMG I LOVED THIS PRODUCT!! FIRST TIME BLEACHING MY HAIR ON MY OWN AND I GOTTA SAY FIRST COUPLE MINUTES IN IT WAS ALREADY TURNING BLONDE! AND MY HAIR HAD SUM BLACK ON IT AND MINES CAME WITH THE GLOVES :) LOVE IT! I RECOMMEND IT!</li>
    <li> Bleach came with the box damaged and a crack in the cream developer which had leaked all over the box. Still usable but it was very messy.</li>
    <li> We had to go out and buy more at a local hair place for this didn&#x27;t bleach my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> Bleach and I never get along. No matter how long i leave it in, the desired lightness is never reached. This bleach is best bought as two boxes for anything longer than chin length hair. One box was not at all enough to do even just the under layers of my hair that i wanted bleached.</li>
    <li> Works quicker than said on box. Dark brown hair to blonde. My hair was chopped all of in october and so I had a head of healthy hair since: curls, no heat, no sulfate, etc and the texture is still the same and barely any damage is noticeable and if there is damage it can be fixed with products that I already have. Very good and does look yellowish when first rinsed out but will be subtle after it dries.</li>
    <li> At the time I had brownish red hair when I used this.  After 20 minutes my hair turned into a really light soft yellowish blonde! It doesn&#x27;t give you that platinum blonde , but it does make it light enough to get other colors such as blue , pink , red etc to show more vibrantly !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this twice to get an even lighter effect and it worked without completely drying out my hair.</li>
    <li> Did everything I needed it too and was easy to apply for a first timer.</li>
    <li> Got the job done; don&#x27;t know what else I could say about it, haha.&lt;br /&gt;There was a lot of leftover, so I think next time I will just make some of it, so I can save the rest. It says once you mix it together you have to throw the rest away, so next time if I will just make a portion of it and throw it away and keep the rest, because I only bleached the tips of my hair and there was a LOT left over that I had to throw away!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally black and already permed. This product took my hair up to a beautiful bleach blonde with practically no damage.</li>
    <li> Worked well just need to buy more than one if you want to do your whole head.</li>
    <li> I was nervous to use this product because of some of the reviews but this bleach is actually really good!! my hair was BLACK. and within 5 minutes of the bleach being on my hair i already saw it getting lighter. by the time i washed it off my hair was a blonde,brown,redish color. it didn&#x27;t get my hair completely light, but WAY lighter than i was expecting it too. my bangs are blonde and the rest of my hair is a brownish red. and the kit comes with everything you need . this product is the best bleach i&#x27;ve used so far . (:</li>
    <li> i have medium brown hair naturally and i was told this would make my hair a medium to light blonder color. left it on for an hour, it came out slotchy dark yellow. i cant afford a hair dresser so they recommended this kit, what a waste and i look horrible. i cant redye it or my hair will fall out. this kit didnt make it dry at all but im not going to risk losing my hair trying to redye it or lighten it. i did try a toner and nothing but healthy hair not the least bit lightened. save some money and go to the store and purchase the brightest blonde bleach kit in person and youll get what you want..cant believe i wasted time money and my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great to bleach your hair</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews I was really excited . I wasn&#x27;t expecting a big change because my hair is black . I left the product in for 90 minutes and my hair has not even changed the slightest but , even on my roots . Waste of time . But when you buy cheap product , you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I have bought this product before but this time it did not include a conditioning toner. Other than that the product works just fine. Remember to deep condition!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best hair bleaches I have tried, I will always use this one as it works the best and without any burning to the scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before, works spectacular, hence why I always get this stuff when I need/want to bleach my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always color my dark brown hair in May. I decided to go with Silver Gray this time, and the dye I used needed it as white as possible. The first pass I left it on for 90 minutes, which is the max time this product recommends. It was a very light-colored yellow (hard to describe, really). I have short hair, had enough for another pass, and it lightened it only a little more after 20 minutes. I&#x27;d say it was about 90% white, 10% yellow. I didn&#x27;t want to go too much more than that and damage my scalp and hair more than it already was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dye worked great!</li>
    <li> This dye is by far the worst. It didn&#x27;t bleach my 100% unprocessed virgin brazillian hair. It fried the ends that I tried to ombre. I repeat do not ever buy this product its the worst. Don&#x27;t ever buy. It was a complete waste of my money. I will never ever buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s maybe the best product I tried. Easy to use and it DID have the gloves many people say are not there. Since they are so neatly attached to the instructions, I suspect they may have been overlooked a few times. I got a little loose on my timing and went too long, causing a bit of damage to my hair. Totally my fault. Watch the clock and you&#x27;ll be very happy, I say.</li>
    <li> This bleach set was just amazing. It bleached pretty quick and my hair is still soft ! which is a big plus, i also ordered the manic panic blue hair cream and the color is just amazing. the should of put gloves in ibecuase it stains very fast. i would and am going to buy their products again!</li>
    <li> This worked like a charm. I have dark brown hair and this took a small piece of hair (like a quarter inch section, just below my chin, only part of the kit) to a light blonde. Since I only used about a quarter of the kit on my hair, a couple of kits would be necessary for a whole head of hair. I let it sit for an hour with foil inside a shower cap. I used the one provided to pull out the section and topped it with another cap to keep the bleach from going everywhere. This can get messy if you are not careful, so wear an old shirt and be prepared to clean anything it falls on after you apply it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Powerful. Left it for 90 as directed for full effect. Burnt my scalp. Like I said...good stuff. Hair turned out as expected. Solid product.</li>
    <li> What I liked about the product is the fact that everything came in the box so nothing was missing. It came earlier than expected and in a good sized packaging. It lightened my black hair, but it still had a yellow nasty tint to it. It didn&#x27;t get it blonde as I had wanted it. I guess I can do that with some toner and blonde hair dye over this, but also this stuff is very powerful and strong! A little on your skin and it burns like hell!! I wish the box also came with 2 pairs of gloves because it gets so messy. So be very careful when using this stuff people!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it out! I&#x27;m going to ombre my hair pretty soon, just gathering the courage to. I&#x27;m also chopping my three foot hair off! I&#x27;ll post a before and after picture to show how well it lifted! It took about 4 days to actually get here. I live in Washington state, and this shipped from Pennsylvania. About the packaging; when I opened the small Amazon box the nice UPS left me under the mat, the initial Manic Panic box was already opened. No product was damaged, but just be aware you might not receive a closed box. And also be aware that the products might be smaller than you think! ;)</li>
    <li> i hav e very dark hair and it worked</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! It&#x27;s easy to use, works well EVERY time you use it. It&#x27;s also affordable. When I think of all the $$$ I spent,only to be disappointed with the color and tone. I will never go back to a salon, unless it&#x27;s for a cut I can&#x27;t do myself or have a friend do.  I highly recommend this product,just be sure to follow the direction exactly and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> OMG... I have dark brown/blackish hair and this kit turned my hair in less than an hour. When my stylist did it a few years ago it took his product 2 hours. It did turn my hair an odd yellowy blonde BUT I put a semi-perm pink/red over it and the color is super bright and fun!! I only bleached the front part of my hair and had to be super careful not to get any bleach on any other part of my hair but using the brush helped.</li>
    <li> Love this bleach. It works great,no burn no itch. I have 4 stars just because if you have a good amount of hair you get very little..I barely had enough for my bangs. But other than that,this bleach is the only bleach I will use because my hair is so sensitive to damage. Its brought my hair a few shades away from platinum blonde when I started with black box dye! I recommended this to anyone</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  I ordered it to bleach my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has very short hair and there was not even enough product to cover her hair completely.  The product seemed to lift the color well but there was just not enough.  I should have purchased two kits for her short hair and can&#x27;t imagine how many you would need to do medium or long hair.  The product description stated that for long hair, two kits may be needed but my daughters hair is maybe 3&amp;#34; long all over so I thought the one would be sufficient.</li>
    <li> Its very difficult to find a bleach that works well on black hair.  Typically when African Americans dye their hair, it looks very orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONLY product I have found that works!  After i use the hair bleach, i always use the snow white toner and it leaves a great result.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t drip. KINDA safe enough to let it sink for 90+ minutes to get super blonde results. It itches a lot on your scalp. Last time it &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; some of my skin in that area (didn&#x27;t notice at the time, but after I had pieces of dead/scared skin), but probably was my fault as I put the bleach close to my skin to get a better coverage (the instructions say clearly don&#x27;t do that). Also, its fumes could make you dizzy. Needs a lot of rinsing. I use conditioner after it, rinse and dry alone, then let it rest for one day before dyeing it. Better if you have somebody to help.</li>
    <li> Never bleached my hair before, so I was nervous trying this. I didn&#x27;t need to be, instructions were clear and simple, very happy with this product. And with using it just for highlights it&#x27;s lasting for quite a few applications. It is rather smelly if you get your nose too close to it, but smell washes out no problem.</li>
    <li> Works great. Just follow the instructions and you&#x27;ll be super satisfied. And, if you have shorter hair, use half of everything and you&#x27;ll have enough leftover for another bleaching session. This kit is a must before applying Manic Panic semi-permanent colors, but it&#x27;s also just a great hair bleach. If you want to end up with a super bleached look in the end, without any yellow or orange, then follow up with Manic Panic&#x27;s Virgin Snow for awesome color-neutralization. No need for a salon.</li>
    <li> BUY TWO BOXES IF YOU HAVE LONG HAIR. For real. I ignored that advice, and ended up with some colour issues. Other than that, everyone knows Manic Panic works really well. It does, duh.</li>
    <li> Buy 3 if you have long hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently sitting with the bleach in my hair and it&#x27;s clear that it does its job, but if you have waist length hair like me you&#x27;re going to need at least 3 kits. I bought two and sadly some of my hair will go unbleached...let&#x27;s hope that makes for an interesting result when the purple goes in.</li>
    <li> This bleach is quite nice, not perfect, but nice. It did lighten my hair to some extent but it left some of my hair reddish copper. I purchased another to see if I can change that. The mixture was not enough and I only did ombre on my hair. Buy two if using on whole hair.</li>
    <li> It did its job with bleaching my hair. It irritated my skin though after I wiped it off. The fumes where really strong. I turned my head kinda fast and the fumes burned my eyes so bad I thought I some how got some of the bleaching stuff in my eyes at first. It did bleach my hair very nice though.</li>
    <li> This bleach kit comes with everything you need! Gloves, tint brush, shower cap, mixing bowl, and of course the developer and bleach powder. The instructions are easy to follow and it gives my hair really good lift.</li>
    <li> I have medium to dark brown hair that never used to lift color very well. I put this on and within 5 min the color was bleaching out of my hair. I left this on around 10 min and my hair was blonde (that yellowy bleached color, but i knew i would have to tone it anyway) This worked great i would use a good treatment after this though unless you like dry hair.</li>
    <li> My second order ..so you know its doing the job !!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best bleacher ever. I wanted my hair white to use atomic turquoise and get the real turquoise color, this product work well with the hair and is kind too with it.</li>
    <li> Be careful very strong can burn your hair.</li>
    <li> incredible developer - worked so fast! minimal damage after bleaching also.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, but if you have very thick/long hair, consider buying two boxes. I have very thick (and long) hair, and this kit enabled me to bleach the ends of my hair twice. I&#x27;ll enclose pictures to speak to how much hair that covered. If I had intended to bleach my entire head, and maybe twice to get it to the lightness level to use most Manic Panic colors over, I think I would have needed at least two boxes. Thankfully I just wanted to dip-dye my hair, and this was wonderful for that. The kit includes a shower cap, a mixing bowl, a painting-brush, the bleach, and developer. I would also recommend if you have hair as dark as mine (dark brown to black), that you invest in a really good coconut oil conditioner and plan to buy more bleach than you think you need. Will definitely be purchasing again, cannot think of a brand I trust more for this product.</li>
    <li> My clip on extension were black. And his product toned them down to brown. So it&#x27;s actually good. I just wished it brought it bit more of product but it&#x27;s still good!</li>
    <li> This works fast wow, I think this is the lightest I have ever gotten my dark brown hair. This made for a really vivid deep purple afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;My kit came with everything I needed. Although I have long, thick, dark hair so I should have ordered two. I JUST did have enough without doing my roots.</li>
    <li> Enjoy your crused box wrapped in plastic leaking powder.</li>
    <li> I have bleached my hair before with various kits in the past and this has been my best experience by far. This kit removed by far the most color than any other kit i&#x27;ve used. It also didn&#x27;t leave my hair super damaged like most bleaching kits which is almost impossible as I have a dye textured hair to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took my curly hair from DARK DARK brown to bright blonde no problem. Used some toner on it and now its ready for some blue dye :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO: I have very long, thick hair. It goes down right to my chest. If you have thick, long hair like me you may need 2-3 kits. Maybe even more. I only bleached the ends of my  hair because thats all I wanted to dye with a softer color. But I used EVERY drop of the kit on my ends. I was almost out and scared I would have to run to Sally and get more bleach but it was just enough. ( just enough for about 4 inches of thick thick hair. )</li>
    <li> i got this product and it says it came with gloves, but i did not get the gloves so i had to buy a pair from the store when i should have got them in the package, so i will be buying this product from someone else if i dont decide not to get it all together. I would not recommend purchasing this product from this person ever.</li>
    <li> This seller contacted me after reviewing this item, it had spilled in the box. They resent a usable product at no cost to me. I would recommend this seller to anyone that likes great customer service!</li>
    <li> So easy to use, all the needed items, brush, gloves and bowl are in the kit.  Lifted my very hard to lift dark brown hair in 50 mins.  I you were going to use it on your entire head I don&#x27;t think this would be enough product, but for sections it&#x27;s more then enough.</li>
    <li> I have black hair and needed to lighten it quickly and easily so that I could put it a lighter color and get the color I wanted to achieve. Manic Panic is an awesome brand and this kit works without leaving the hair really rough.</li>
    <li> I DIDN&#x27;T REALLY LIKE THE COLOR THAT MY HAIR BLEACHED TO.  I NOW USE A STORE BOUGHT BLEACHING KIT AND IT BLEACHES MY HAIR ALOT BETTER TO COMPLIMENT THE MANIC PANIC RED COLORS THAT I THEN USE ON MY HAIR.</li>
    <li> Nothing special it bleached my hair.. It did burn my scalp and I&#x27;ve been dying and bleaching my hair fur a long time. I was only able to keep it on for around -5 minutes the pain was too much. I ended up using a box dye after and got the results I wanted.. This was a waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> I have dark hair, and made the mistake of using boxed blonde hair coloring, NOT the thing to do, unless ya like orange hair ha! (At least I don&#x27;t) If you are looking to go from dark to blonde hair then this IS the product to choose. It is not only easy to use, but it DOES do what it says. This is the second time I bought this and used it, and will continue to do so, especially for the price. Also, you pretty much start seeing it work in a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it does damage hair but you have to know how to use it and how to protect you&#x27;re hair and take care of it afterwards. I will be ordering this product again. I highly suggest it to anyone who is trying to bleach their hair from black to a lighter color. Please know when bleaching your hair from black to blonde know that you will have to order two, and use them a month or two apart to protect your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to dye my medium brown/gray hair blond as part of a gag.  I have little experience with hair bleaching products so I was apprehensive about how long it would take and how blond my hair would get.  The product worked as expected and I was very pleased with the speed at which it worked.  I am a male with medium-brown hair (roughly 1&amp;#34; long on top) and graying hair on the sides (roughly 1/4-1/2&amp;#34; long).  I applied the product and within 35 minutes my hair was very blond.  Even the gray hair was bleached.  The product does have a strong odor which is expected given the strength so be sure to have plenty of ventilation.  I found the directions easy to follow and the product simple to mix.  Applying was somewhat difficult as I was doing it by myself.  I ended up putting on the included plastic gloves and simply worked it into my hair, put on the cap and started the timer.  I probably could have left the product on longer to get my hair even lighter but I ran out of time.  The product did not seem to damage my hair but I had not bleached it to this degree before.</li>
    <li> But my fiance got the bright idea to use 2 kits on a small area of hair.. on me. Never again. But aside from that, it is a good product and does the trick. Keep a good conditioner handy for after though.</li>
    <li> Came smashed up and when I went to pour the developer in the container, most of it was spilt out because of it being smashed.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: MY HAIR IS FALLING OUT IN CLUMPS. DO NOT BUY THIS.  TL;DR version: Cons: -does almost nothing to lighten hair -extremely irritating, even after rinsing. -tiny amount of product for the price -very damaging -MAKES YOUR HAIR FALL OUT Pros: I honestly can&#x27;t think of any. full review: So, it&#x27;s been 2 days since I used this bleach. I left a deep conditioner in for 12 hours yesterday and I&#x27;m doing another right now. My hair is FALLING OUT. I have bleached my hair many times and this has never happened before. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for about 7 years. In all of that time, I&#x27;ve probably used every popular bleach there is. I decided to try this one because of all the positive reviews, and I am very dissatisfied. I&#x27;ll be wearing a hat to the beauty supply when I get a better bleach to fix this crap. To start off, this bleach is pretty weird to mix. The instructions to say to mix it until all lumps were gone. No matter how much I stirred, the product was still kind of lumpy and powdery. It might be that it didn&#x27;t come with enough developer. I got all the developer it was possible to get out of the bottle. The product also &amp;#34;thickens&amp;#34; after a minute. This made it really airy, like weird, powdery mousse. It was pretty hard to spread because of this texture, so there was just *barely* enough to cover my very short hair. The final product was the worst part about this bleach. It made my head itch like crazy while it was on. Also, after about 15 minutes, it completely stopped working. I left it in for another 20-30 minutes and it didn&#x27;t get any lighter. It turned my roots (virgin hair) a very lemony, dark yellow. It did absolutely nothing to my ends. The ends of my hair were a medium brown when I put this bleach in, and they were medium brown when I rinsed the bleach out. This is also probably one of the most damaging bleaches I&#x27;ve used (which is weird since it barely did anything to my hair.) I have very healthy hair that I take good care of, and after rinsing this, an unexpected amount of my hair was falling out. It dried to a very straw-like texture and it&#x27;s crinkly, almost like I got my hair crimped. Some of the bleach came into contact with my skin while I was applying it and while i was in the shower rinsing it out and caused awful irritation. Even now, hours later, my skin on my neck, back, and shoulders is burning and itching like crazy. I have no known allergies and this has never happened to me with other bleach products. I also got a migraine shortly after using this product, which may or may not have been related. In conclusion, don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I&#x27;ve bought off brand bleach from sally&#x27;s (I believe it was called prism, and it had a lovely apple scent.) for a fraction of the price that was way better than this.</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t enough bleach and there was way too much developer.</li>
    <li> I am a bit disappointed by this product. One, there is way too little even for shorter hair. Two, the product did not work on my dark hair. I have a med/dark brown hair. It worked in some spots and in others it didn&#x27;t. So I had to recolor my hair brown. So basically I wasted $20.</li>
    <li> It is damaging but the product does its job. I have brown extensions so I can try the color on before I out it in my hair. This product definitely lightened it. After washing the bleach out, I saw that the extensions(human hair) were a little damaged.  But other than that.  I am impressed with the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not that experienced with bleach but my hair turned out fine and it was gradual enough, color also showed up nice on it though I didn&#x27;t bleach it that light. my hair felt fine afterward too, I had to bleach it twice and it was ok.</li>
    <li> I bleach my dark brown hair white and dye it pink, doing it for a few years now. After MANY terrible bleaching attempts and all different brands and volume - I have finally found my dream come true! I use the 40 volume when I&#x27;ve let my roots grow more than an inch or two. If they are shorter, I just go with the 30 volume. It&#x27;s so easy, pre measured and it WORKS! Grab a friend to help you get the bits in the back and within an hour - platinum roots. Plus it&#x27;s Amazon Prime! BRILLIANT!</li>
    <li> manic panic products are really good, if you are looking for something dramatic that work this is perfect I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Was okay. Nothing to rave about bit it did it&#x27;s job</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and in tact.  I was doing a dying party for about 20 people (dying streaks of hair NOT the whole head) and I was able to use one bottle for everyone. I recommend have some experience with hair dying as bleach can be one of the more unforgiving products of hair dying, but this box provides everything needed. There wasn&#x27;t a thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product and would recommend it for anyone looking to get a good color out of their dye.</li>
    <li> You want white hair? This will get you there! Very STRONG!</li>
    <li> Complete kit. Easy to mix. Worked well. Covered an impressive amount of my long hair. Left my hair in good condition afterwards. Pic: https://instagram.com/p/5cGZxfGsIZ/</li>
    <li> This product was great, came before delivery date. I used it for root touch up&#x27;s (about one inch, inch &amp; a half) all over my head. This will work as an over all dye if you have very short hair. Even coloring &amp; I have dark brown hair naturally. I wanted a bleached blonde look &amp; that&#x27;s what I got, without damaging my hair. I would use this product again &amp; recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this so that I could strip sections of my hair out at a time.. until I was able to get the box-dyed black color out. It worked well after an hour. Not more than an hour-and-a-half. Use a good conditioner afterwards, as this stuff can dry out the hair. Don&#x27;t need to apply heat to it; I&#x27;d just recommend not sitting next to an air conditioner or any drafty spots. I&#x27;d buy it again; actually, it&#x27;s back in my cart!</li>
    <li> I originally though the gloves and cap were missing, but when I went to open the tub of bleach powder, I found that all the \\&quot;missing\\&quot; things were in there! It was exactly as I had hoped!  Sorry for the initial review.</li>
    <li> I kind of thought it was going to be bigger but maybe that was just my misconception. It worked faster and better than the store bought brand. All in all, I like it.</li>
    <li> It was used by my kid and was good. I bought this together with a hair coloring product.&lt;br /&gt;Took a while to arrive but not as long as the color did.</li>
    <li> The items that were supposed to come in the box were not in the box</li>
    <li> I wanted a product to whiten the hair that my sister dyed pink. I was envisioning Storm of the X-men.&lt;br /&gt;SOOOO, I tried it out with this stuff, It bleached my hair for sure, but because my hair had been dyed a little less than a year ago, I only put the solution on for 60 minutes knowing that it you put it on too long it will melt off but also that the strand test I did, literally showed no difference at all, but I wrapped my hair with seran wrap and a plastic bag and it did get brighter, but the pink isn&#x27;t gone, but it&#x27;s brighter. It went from a more magenta color to a cotton candy color. I would recommend this to someone who has un-dyed hair, as it turned my fake blonde parts to yellow also, but I would like to say that this solution is rather high quality as my hair is in great condition for just being bleached. I had no problems purchasing and the package arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to go from a bad dye job that turned black. I kept this in for  25 min and it turned a light enough blonde/ orange to where I could wash it out. I dyed my hair light brown the next day and there is absolutely no damage to my hair. Don&#x27;t keep it in as long as it says. There is only enough in the box to cover your hair if your hair reaches about an inch below your shoulders. &lt;- that is only if you add all of the developer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the blonde bleaching colors or hair treatments and nothing worked. Even going to the salon my hair doe not catch the colors (Especially blonde) well at all. This actually turned my hair platinum something I never thought would&#x27;ve been possible. But it worked like a charm and did not dry my hair out as much as I was expecting it too with a name like &#x27;amplified&#x27; :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying another one soon so I can do all of my hair.</li>
    <li> I needed to bleach before going red, worked well on my dark hair. Easy to use and worked for what I needed.</li>
    <li> I only bleached a handful of hair towards the nape of my neck and there was a good amount of the stuff left in the tub. Still, I don&#x27;t think there was enough for my entire head if I wanted to go full blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER. I give this 5 stars because with only one application, I was able to turn a handful of my super dark Asian hair into a white blonde.&lt;br /&gt;There was no orange tint at all and my hair does not feel weak or brittle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with the result.</li>
    <li> work awesome, I have a lot of hair so I bought 2 boxes and it lightened it all the way down for me to put the color that I wanted on it. I will use this again and again.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair different colors for 5 years now, I always make sure I wait a good amount of time in between bleaching because it can be very damaging no matter what brand you use, I have probably in total bleached my hair at least 7 or 8 times if not more and I have used Manic Panic Flash Lightning almost every time. It is absolutely incredible and despite what some reviews say even my naturally thin hair  has never once seemed to be very damaged from it. I have had some horrible experiences with other brands of bleach but this is the only one I absolutely love. A lot of the negative reviews on this product are due to problems with shipping and how the package arrived which is misleading considering the product itself never caused problems for them. Some of the negative reviews stated that they had black or extremely dark brown hair and this turned it slightly orange. Honey, if you have dyed your hair black or have very dark hair no matter what brand of bleach you use it won&#x27;t magically turn it platinum blonde after one use,  it takes time, I spent months goign from black to a lighter colour because I waited at least a month or two between each bleach because no matter what bleaching product you use it can damage your hair if you over use it or aren&#x27;t smart about it. For the people saying it made their hair fall out I am so sorry that is a horrible situation but everyone reacts to chemicals differently and if you have bleached it in the past a lot or if you damage your hair on a regular basis (ex. blow drying, straightning) then it really increases the risk. I love all of Manic Panic products so much, they are good quality, not really over priced and always work great!</li>
    <li> Omg, this is golden, is perfect, i actually don&#x27;t use it to bleach my hair, well at least not in my head, i use it for my arm hair and the upper part of my body, to give it that golden tan look, i have olive skin so when i do that it looks golden tan, super sexy, the kit is amazing, it has everything you need and more, is a lot of product at least for what i use it, i bought 2 kits thinking there were going to be little, boy was i mistaken, one was more than enough and i had some left which was a total shame &#x27;cause i didn&#x27;t have anything to bleach, if i could give it 10 stars, i would, and also super quick, i usually last around 20 mins to get my body hair bleached, in less than 10 i was ready to go and they look just as i wanted. Regular customer from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this a lot more than splat, with splat the bleach was patchy and made my hair look like crap and it took forever to get it the color I wanted. With this my hair feels much heather after and it only took half the time to get it light enough. And no burning!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It was pretty good , though with having natural red hair I&#x27;ll probably need another treatment if I wanted to get the shade I want, plus I would have gotten the toner as well to help against the brassiness of my hair.</li>
    <li> I use this bleach for so long and If you want to bleach your whole hair you better buy two boxes of this.</li>
    <li> This bleach brought my very dark, fine, and thick hair to a light blonde without any damage. My hair still feels soft and my scalp feels okay as well.</li>
    <li> If you need your hair to be the lightest it can possibly get, use this product. The lightening process is fast! My only complaint is that it&#x27;s pretty harsh on the ends of your hair, so make sure you condition a ton before using this product. Do that a week before using to make sure you don&#x27;t have to actually cut your hair like I did (To be honest, I have been dying mine and bleaching all year, so my hair had been through the ringer).</li>
    <li> I bought this product to touch up a saloon job (whole head bleach to platinum) but it was still orange as I had expected considering I have been coloring my hair darkest brown (nearly black) for years...So I chopped off my hair to a short pixie, re-colored it and it brought it up to nearly white/pale yellow in no time (including the dark roots that were growing in mixed with gray hair).  I followed up with a wella toner and my hair turned a great shade of platinum.  Love it.  I will most likely buy a more expensive product in the future that has more quantity, since I plan on coloring my own hair from now on.  But it cost is an issue I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have short hair, so got alot of use out of the bleach. Works great before using manic panic colors. Will get again.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a Manic Panic product and it didn&#x27;t work. I called the company and emailed them pictures of my before and after also of their product bottle. Customer service hah that&#x27;s funny. All they could do is go on about how good my hair looked and how natural their product. Don&#x27;t waste your time oe money on any of their products.</li>
    <li> this is the best hair bleaching kit, i dont like the smell its strong to me. but overall great product</li>
    <li> I had a lot of cherry red punk hair to get rid of. i was just tired of it. Used this and it worked...took a couple of times before all the red was out and I could put a new rinse on it...If you want to get rid of punk dyed hair this is a must.</li>
    <li> Nice and gentle bleach.  This bleach works nice and will get your hair to a white w/out destroying your hair if you follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> It got all of the synthetic color out of my hair. It did not remove the pure indigo powder, though. I will buy again just for how it removed the other color.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and i am so loyal to the brand they have never failed me. I will always buy</li>
    <li> My hair is/was dark brown, I put this on for 15 minutes, washed it out (with a ton of conditioner) and was pleasantly surprised to see golden locks.&lt;br /&gt;10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If your hair is short, like say you have an undercut, and less than 6 inches of hair on top, one tub is mpre than enough.</li>
    <li> I think it works and it definitely can bleach your hair. But this is also too small and too strong for hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have hair on shoulder length, and I have thick Asian dark brown hair. This kit only can bleach half of my hair! I knew I needed to bleach my hair twice to get to the blonde. But I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. I would rather get a giant bottle of hair developer for $4 and bleach powder for $20 (you can bleach more than 4 times out of it!) in Sally supplies! Way cheaper and way more safe to have staff help you to choose what is best for you.&lt;br /&gt;40 developer would ruin your hair really bad and you can&#x27;t really bleach your hair evenly if you are not professional! So if you want to bleach your hair really light (for example, almost white blonde), probably plan a 2-3 weeks plan to do it. bleach it with 20/ 30 volume developer is WAY easier!!! at least more time for you to apply it on your hair and it will look even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money! Go to a Sally store around your area!</li>
    <li> Does what it said and works great.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it zero stars.  It seems cruel to the one star I used. We followed the directions exactly and with in 5 minutes her hair actually started to sizzle and burned her shoulder.  This was my daughter.  Thank god we were only stripping the bottom 5&amp;#34; of her hair.  We immediately rinsed her hair and what didn&#x27;t break off looked like old doll hair.  Her original hair, by the way, is thick smooth hair.  No texture.  I spoke to my hair dresser later and she said to never use this product.  She said to use Blondor.  After her hair grows back (fortunately, it is down to her shoulders still) we will try that. maybe..</li>
    <li> I had no problems with this other than light shipping damage.  At first, I thought the shipping was great because the box was basically shrink-wrapped to a piece of cardboard, but it was wrapped so tight that the box had some squish-damage and the plastic tip of the bleach bottle was bent and poking through a corner.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the actual bleach kit though.&lt;br /&gt;I did have to leave on the product longer than I do with other bleaches but that could be because I only bleach a single strip of hair so I don&#x27;t mix the full kit at once which is recommended on the box.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this product and this box will last me quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the product is scorching/destroying your hair, you most-likely aren&#x27;t using the right volume bleach.  I&#x27;ve used Manic Panic products for years and never had a problem that wasn&#x27;t my own fault.</li>
    <li> This product worked a treat, even on my poor &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; hair.  I was damned sick of the &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; blonde look before ever trying it.  If my hair wasn&#x27;t going to be the red that it was for most of my life, then it was going to be precisely the colour that the red turned when I was 20 years old-pure white.  I had spent over a dozen years dyeing it red, having a blast re-creating the colour of my youth. Now my face is just too rumpled and lived-in for the red.  And I hate the &amp;#34;old-lady-blonde&amp;#34; look that so may in my age group pursue.  What the heck do these people WANT, anyway?  They look ridiculous. Lived-in faces deserve more respect than &amp;#34;old-lady-blonde&amp;#34; hair.  So pure white it must be, and this product delivers!  I gave it a go, then followed up a week later with Amplified Virgin Snow.  Now young men in their 20s give me wonderful compliments on my hair.  I&#x27;m their mothers&#x27; age!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that my hair has not suffered the bleaching.  I was warned that this kit was &amp;#34;too harsh&amp;#34;.  It wasn&#x27;t. I applied it and left it in for the longer time recommended, and have had no troubles.</li>
    <li> Nice product, really easy to use. Although my hair is black, it still bleached it pretty well, not like white color but bright blonde.</li>
    <li> it felt like my scalp was on fire! my neck got burned and it left my hair a banana yellow</li>
    <li> I picked up this product to bleach the bottom half of my hair a light blonde. I had little hope since I had had my hair bleached professionally before but  to no avail, my hair was a measly a lighter red. (My hair is very thick) The results of the manic panic amazed me. Not only did it lighten my hair drastically but also rid it of the red tone. The only thing I have to say is make sure you do a strand test and spread the bleach evenly! It seems obvious, but I was eager. My hair turned out a little whiter in some places because of that but that&#x27;s my own fault. I&#x27;d also like to add that the product is great for it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> Smells so bad. I could barely breathe. But! It bleached my hair so well and my hair feels fine afterwards.</li>
    <li> it lightened the heck out of my hair, but also destroyed it. that was probably my fault as i had no idea what i was doing. it did what i needed it to do, but i did have to cut 3 inches of damage off my head.</li>
    <li> Great product! Worked amazing for me, and l have almost black hair! But for first time users, I have some advice. Never ever EVER bleach your roots at home. I did it once and my hair started falling out. Doing the rest of your hair is fine, but if you have to get your roots done get them bleached professionally</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This works great o had red hair and it got almost all of it outi had to buy an another one to get my hair all blonde</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every bleach/lighting kits there is at the stores &amp; always ended up with patches of different colors! my natural hair  color is brown but dyed it black various times. never been able to get rid of the black &amp; been suffering because there was never the right result. I saw this one &amp; decided to buy it just for the heck of it, I knew surly that I&#x27;d be disappointed. BUT, surprisingly it took it out! it turned half from the top of my hair white/blonde (my regrowth hair) &amp; where the black was (which were the stands), turned a light brown/reddish. I loved the results because at the end of the day I could finally color my hair red like I&#x27;ve always wanted!! I bought 2 boxes because I have long hair &amp; also because in each box there was not very much product. so for long hair, I recommend 2 or 3 boxes! YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED!!  :-)</li>
    <li> The only bleach I use on my hair.</li>
    <li> Did not come with the contents described on the box. Did not have gloves, no cap, and no brush. Only thing it had was the tub (which I already have), powder, and developer... Looks like the it might have been rifled through before getting to me...</li>
    <li> Worked very well and fast. I have very thick hair and had to use 2 boxes.</li>
    <li> The instructions said it could take up to an hour and a half to fully lighten my thick, very dark hair. Not so, it worked SO FAST. I was platinum in about 10mins. Really happy with how quick and easy this was, great color results. :)</li>
    <li> I had almost black hair and this kit was able to lift it.&lt;br /&gt;My kit came with gloves, even though it didn&#x27;t seem like it at first. The instructions says to use only enough developer to make the bleach power a smooth liquid. I did that and I almost didn&#x27;t have enough to cover my hair. (I have medium length hair)&lt;br /&gt;That was my only really complaint. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> went from a medium to platinum blonde in one sitting with this! i love it!</li>
    <li> I use it all the time to dye my hair extensions or my own hair ( worked even on black hair)</li>
    <li> Not enough to actually bleach your whole head. I have naturally kinda dark brown hair, and I got my hair cut pretty short before using this product, now my is his thinned and sits a little long then my shoulders. It still didn&#x27;t cover my entire head, now i have to have my hair look ridiculous waiting for more to come in the mail. And the parts it did bleach are still very yellow orange and light brown.</li>
    <li> You want to bleach your hair and this works.</li>
    <li> Over the last several months, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with haircolor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been changing my hair from black to blonde and vice versa. I had most of my hair colored black leaving the front sections bleached out so that I could dye semi-permanent Manic Panic colors over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, simultaneous upkeep of blonde and black was very frustrating. The first day I colored my hair black, I loved it until I took a shower. I&#x27;ve learned that jet black hair dye *will* wash out into the black and produce not only a gross mouldy green tint on blonde hair, but that the black quickly washes out to a hideous muddy, mousy brown. The ends of my hair were a ratty grey-brown and I couldn&#x27;t stand looking at it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exasperated, I decided to choose between a solid blonde or solid black. I had already purchased this Flashlighting kit at this time, so I literally closed my eyes to choose which one it was going to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I ended up choosing the bleach, and wow, it worked like a charm. The sections that were dyed black began to lift almost immediately to blonde. I left the stuff on for two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to say that my hair feels any healthier, but that could also be that my hair was already damaged to begin with from dyeing and re-bleaching several times. Luckily, my hair&#x27;s thick enough that I hardly am worried about it. I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving the new haircolor. The parts that were once dyed black are now a pretty strawberry blonde and the front sections of my hair are platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may not be for everyone, as a lot of people will fuss that the results are too &amp;#34;brassy&amp;#34;, but frankly, I prefer warmer, even orange, tones to my hair whenever I go blonde. I&#x27;d describe my current color as an edgy, alternative blonde which suits my personal style amazingly.</li>
    <li> It takes too much time to be effective, and it hurts the scalp... I will definitely  not buy it again</li>
    <li> This is better than any other bleach I have used! It is the only bleach that seems to take red completely out of my hair! However, the container is rather small so if you have long or thick hair, you might want to buy two.</li>
    <li> First and only hair bleach I&#x27;d ever used. Natural medium brown past shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it took me 2 boxes. Luckily my room mate ran and grabbed me a second box, or I&#x27;d of been a hair dalmatian for a few days.</li>
    <li> When I used it I should have started at the back of my head because this thing works fast. Before I could bleach the rest of my hair the part I did at the front was already yellow so I ended up having on part much brighter than the others</li>
    <li> I went onto the Manic Panic website for instructions on how to use this product. What a bust. My hair is now ORANGE. This is so far from what I wanted. What a waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> I had a not-so-pleasant experience with this product.  I tried putting some on my arm to test how it&#x27;d feel, but I believe my scalp is more sensitive than the rest of my body.  This burned too much on my head and only managed to dye my roots.  I had been previously using Henna Maiden black and indigo dye.. so my conclusion has only been that there&#x27;s too much henna in my hair for any hair dye, even a bleach kit to penetrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, please do a skin test before trying this.  I have read worse experiences than mine.  I had a burning sensation and irritation upon contact, even with avoiding putting it on my scalp.  No hair loss, but I wouldn&#x27;t take chances with this again.</li>
    <li> Works great. I used it to lift henna (directions say not to). It took my hair color down to a light orange that wasn&#x27;t brassy. I really liked it like it was but I wanted to try purple and my hair color was light enough that the purple color turned out great. Will definitely use this bleach kit again. So easy and didn&#x27;t destroy my hair.</li>
    <li> It turned my dark brown roots blonde and my dyed black ends orange. I used two boxes on my medium length hair. I left it on for two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant damage and my hair feels lovelier than it looks.</li>
    <li> Shipped very quickly and securely. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Really does bleach the hair.&lt;br /&gt;But I really suggest getting it down from s pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or even calling up hairdressing school, they do it for cheap or free.</li>
    <li> I love it! It is amazing n&#x27; terrible at the same time. My hair was black brown, so whenever I dye my hair into a lighter color without the bleach, it would not show it. Soo I saw this product n decide to buy it. After reciving this product few weeks, I try it. It made my hair, not truly blonde but an orange look which is fine for me( at least it&#x27;s lighter now). But ik using bleach is a bad idea bcuz it damages the hair( it damage my hair making my hair sooo frizzy) . At least it&#x27;s worth it &amp; u can always cut it &amp; re-grow it.</li>
    <li> My hair was light brown and when I used it and washed it out after 45 min it did nothing to my hair. All it did was make my hair feel like hay. wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying.</li>
    <li> This kit has everything in it! Very convenient. It did lift my hair to a desirable level without destroying/frying it. I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s trying to bleach their hair for the first time! :)</li>
    <li> A little small but works well!</li>
    <li> Maximum bleach, minimum damage.</li>
    <li> crazy good! I put it on my tips to have blonde tips, note that my hair is close to jet black, once you put it in your hair, you can almost see it changing black to blonde, and I left it on my hair for about 15 minutes or whatever it said on the box, and I showered right after that, and what do you know, right when I dried my hair, it was blonde!! the only downside is that it comes w a very llttle amount of product, I barely had enough for my tips, so a box will definitely not do if you are planning on doing your whole hair. but it definitely wont damage your hair, the way other dyeing products would. its much calmer with a heavier result. The product is amazing, I will definitely keep coming back.</li>
    <li> This worked great. Leave on quite awhile if trying to get red out.</li>
    <li> I used this to strip the color out of my hair.  I did get some brassy tones, but I was bleaching my hair to dye another color over it so that was fine.  It was easy to mix, and didn&#x27;t make a big mess.</li>
    <li> Excellent, turned my hair almost white, color took very well.</li>
    <li> It lightened my hair VERY quickly. my roots were nearly white and the rest of my hair orange (DUE TO HENNA) this was to be expected, henna doesn&#x27;t leave your hair. It lightened my hennaed hair much lighter than I thought it would, but honestly I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> I saw it begin to process almost instantaneously!  Had a mix of color in my hair (from my natural, red/purple, and blue) so did not process evenly, but even on the dark previously dyed areas of my hair it worked well.  Did not burn like other bleaching/blonde dye products I&#x27;ve used.  Hair still felt soft after use.</li>
    <li> Only bleach I&#x27;ve ever used that gets red dye out.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical after ordering because people said there wasn&#x27;t enough product...there was plenty for me. I have medium length, thick hair, and I was able to use half of the powder and activator and save the rest for a later use. You only need a thin layer on your hair to bleach it out white. I left it on my dark brown  hair for 45 minutes and my hair was completely white and ready to be dyed with the special effects I ordered. Great bleach kit, plenty of product, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!!!!!  I have dark brown hair and have been paying a professional to bleach my hair for the passed 7 years.  I finally decided to try it myself after hearing good feedback from other customers.  Not only did the kit come with everything you need, but my hair looks amazing!  After 45 minutes my hair was bleach blonde without any yellow streaks.  I will  be saving almost $600 a year using this stufff.  I am soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  happy!!!!!!  The only thing I would suggest to other customers is buying two boxes.  My hair is shoulder length, and even though I  only bleached my roots, I just barely had enough left to finish.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve been desperately trying to go from red to blond and the comments led me to believe this stuff worked miracles. While it did very little to the lower half of my hair (what has been red the longest) the top half is now actually a very pretty white. The application isn&#x27;t as easy as other products but over all it did what one may expect.</li>
    <li> I have hair a little past my shoulders and it is somewhat thick and I thought buying THREE would be enough but it wasn&#x27;t. A little under a fourth of my hair was uncolored and I had to wait three days to finish. It bleached it pretty well though.</li>
    <li> I have used this several times to remove black, purple and blue colors from my hair. Each time it performed as well as, if not better than expected. I left it on for the maximum time to get the most drastic results possible. This took my hair from black to a very light yellow after about an hour and a half. The next time I used it for a full 2 hours and there was not a trace of blue or purple left in my hair. It was almost white and held the next color I applied perfectly after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight burning sensation when you first apply and for the first 15 minutes or so. It is not an unbearable or painful burn, just slightly uncomfortable and itchy. I did not have any issues with hair loss or damage from using this and will be using it again the next time I change colors.</li>
    <li> It worked great, I loved it.</li>
    <li> It didnt work for black hair i had to use 2 boxes.</li>
    <li> does what its says i only left it on for 20 mins. whole head is blonde and no chem bruns!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this on already dyed hair, my hair was dyed blonde, but I had roots growing in. My natural hair is very dark brown and is very thick, but after an hour almost my entire head was a very light blonde. My only issue is that the roots on the back of my head didn&#x27;t get coated as evenly as the front, even though I used all of the powder and creme activator. I would recommend a friend to help you make sure that all of your hair has been coated evenly, or to help you redistribute if you noticed that you&#x27;ve missed a patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dye brush included in this kit is good for precision application, but doesn&#x27;t do well if you are just trying to get the bleach on quickly. I would recommend a dye bottle with a small applicator nozzle to get to hard to reach places, and if your hair is thick it is helpful to get under the layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a spare box currently in waiting, but when I&#x27;ve used that up I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
    <li> I love this product it helps me go from red to green with no problem at all. Definitely a great product.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as the other. I really love this product</li>
    <li> SO FRIKIN GOOD MY HAIR THAT IS DYED BLACK TURNED BLONDE IN LIKE 40 MINS WOO HOO SMELLS BAD THO BUT O WELL</li>
    <li> Best lightening ever for black hair. I&#x27;m a black and white mix guy. I do dye my hair in blond since many year. I saw manic panic and wanted to give a try! This product is the better I&#x27;ve never use.&lt;br /&gt;It work great for black short hair. I applied a half of the product on my dirty hair (a week of dirt) keep the product for an hour the washed it. The result was very good. I usually dye my hair 2-3 time before to get the perfect white color I want. But with manic panic after the first application I was almost satisfy of the color. I waited 5 days and dyed again my hair with the other half. I kept it 35mn only, I started to feel some iching in my hair, I guess because my hair were clean. Anyway I washed my hair after 35mn and I was very satisfy. My hair were white grey, I really like the color And that was the color I always wanted but never got it.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is for men short dark hair:&lt;br /&gt;- Keep your hair dirty for a week! You can keep take a shower and wet your hair don&#x27;t just put soap or shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;- Use Vaseline, oil, butter... Anything greasy to Protect the skin of your forehead, you ear, the countour of your hair...all the area the product will touch to protect the skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Star applying the product by the centre of your head usually this part take more time to dye(for me) so I prefere to star by there then finishing by my countour as my hair are very short and will not take long to dye and I&#x27;m avoid exposing the product in my forehead skin for to long.&lt;br /&gt;- after applying you can use the plastic cap to cover your hair, but personally I don&#x27;t because I ended op removing every 10mn the cap to see my hair so I finally decide to not use the shower cap and honestly for a man isn&#x27;t that sexy ;))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After and hour wash your hair and do a conditioner mask in your hair for arrondissement 10mn, rinse it and let it dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;If you are not satisfy with your color, wait minimum 4days en re do the same process but this time keep it max 30mn.&lt;br /&gt;If you have black short hair (men style) and follow step by step those instruction trust me you will end up with a beautiful blond grey. I both the manic panic virgin snow toner but I didn&#x27;t needed because I got my blond without even the toner.</li>
    <li> I have short salt and pepper hair and wanted a platinum blonde. After spending $$$ at salons with miserable results (yellow, brass), I decided to put matters in my own hands and tried this product. The first time I left it on for 90 minutes and it was still too yellow for my taste. I applied it three days later for 30 minutes and now I am pleased! I followed with their white toner and will never go back to any salon.</li>
    <li> I used this on previously bleached hair that I used semi-permanent dye on, and it bleached it to a nice almost white-blonde. I leave it on for max time, because my hair is naturally black. I also bleached some hair that hasnt been bleached before, and it turned out just as light. If you also buy a semi-permanent dye you are going to use after you bleach your hair, you can keep the gloves, tint brush and plastic cap from this kit. They come in handy for coloring too.</li>
    <li> I have short black hair I ordered 4 of these bleaching kits I plan to use two one day and two the next day before applying the virgin snow white I want to get it as clear as possible with the bleach kits I want my hair to be snow white</li>
    <li> This product worked great and I have no complaints about that.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that you can&#x27;t reseal and reuse it (DO NOT COVER THE BLEACH MIXTURE.  IT WILL EXPLODE).  So I ended up with a lot of wasted bleach (I have very short hair).  They should sell these in different sizes.</li>
    <li> On dark brown hair it turned my hair ash blond. Which I was expecting. I wish I let it in more longer till it turned blonde. After that I applied purple dye and it turned out so pretty. So I was content with the results and it didn&#x27;t damaged my hair at all :)</li>
    <li> This kit worked FAST to bleach my roots--about half the processing time of my last dye job to achieve the same shade. However, it burned my scalp a LOT and the amount provided would never cover my whole head. If you have long hair and want to dye all of it, you may need to buy multiple kits or look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> It did NOTHING to my hair but make it brittle and it didn&#x27;t even lighten all of it, only in certain spots and it looked horrible!</li>
    <li> Smells to high heaven, and be careful not to destroy your hair, but it was the best for roots and missed spots when I had white hair. My original color is medium brown with auburn tones. Also, the purple toner works good with this. (no, it won&#x27;t make you white depending on original color. That&#x27;s what toner is for)</li>
    <li> wow i absolutly loved this product, it turned my medium brown hair to a light blonde color. its worth buying.</li>
    <li> They were out of stock on this order, but they refunded me and I bet this product does a good job I&#x27;ve heard many positive things about this bleach product. The price for this product is kinda pricey, but the costumer service is very friendly and calm to deal with.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Sidenote: You&#x27;ll need two of these kits at LEAST, maybe even three - if you have thick and/or longish hair. Simply doesn&#x27;t come with enough powder and developer to get the job done with one kit (for my thick hair, anyway). Great product though!</li>
    <li> I bought a bleach in a store, like any brand would do i guess. The stripe ones are the strongest. This made my hair yellow before I used manic panic bleach. After applying the panic my hair was white. As blond as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I play around with conditioners, grey, ice white(Virgin snow,  blueish white) purple white ect. Will dye a color soon as im bored with white :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow these steps and play around with different conditioners. Dont use strong shampoo if you want to keep the style. I use only to wash with balm on those days, im a guy so.. Might be different with long hair and stuff ;)</li>
    <li> I was a person that bleached my hair for the very first time ever, and I used this bleach in 40 Vol. It bleached my hair so quick and so evenly! I honestly love this bleach. My main concern was the itch, I was worried about it, but it really doesn&#x27;t itch!</li>
    <li> Loved it...worked in less than 5 minutes try it!!!</li>
    <li> Holy crap I look like Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future.</li>
    <li> I am writing this not for the quality of the product, it&#x27;s because this item sent to me was in an open package. Open as in the brown package box with the usual Amazon brown color package tape is broken, it was resealed with clear tape.  The item was also previously opened, and is resealed with a clear tape, the top was ripped, powder spilled inside, not to mention the box looks like 20yrs old. I don&#x27;t know if I want to use this on my hair. It looks very questionable.  I attached a picture of the item.</li>
    <li> Got it quick. It was really easy, a lot easier than other products I&#x27;ve used. Color was fabulous in a short amount of time. Everything went well with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Again this stuff is great. Really works good on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have jet black hair and I wanted to dye my hair Burgundy. I got this bleaching kit to bleach my hair first. It was my first time trying to use anything of that kind on my hair and it was very simple and easy. I left it my hair for 45 min and cover my head with with kitchen food foil to keep my hair from drying out. Then i washed my hair and Viola my hair were totally blonde :D&lt;br /&gt;Then when I used the original color from manic panic it showed up on hair so pretty!</li>
    <li> Worked fast and great!</li>
    <li> I have dark brown/black hair and did a &#x27;test strip&#x27; of hair using this product before dying it all. Glad I did! I was looking more for a white/platinum blonde and this ended up as more of a light, pale yellow for me. Perfect though if you plan to go right behind and dye it another color like blue/red/purple etc.</li>
    <li> great product it came in early and everything was included as said</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, but please PLEASE don&#x27;t leave it on for too long.. I believe this stuff could bleach just about anything!  My bangs are recovering well from the breakage thank goodness, but please be careful with this and definitely wear a mask.  This stuff is strong to inhale as well.</li>
    <li> I put it in around 11:10AM today, I washed it out 30 minutes later and I absolutely love the colour. It made it into a very light blonde. My hair was a dark brown almost black. I would recommend this to anyone looking to bleach their hair</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and it did work. However, it did not live up to it&#x27;s promise and i had to use another product to achieve the results I wanted.</li>
    <li> Hey all! Alright so first things first. I finished treatment for cancer 2.5 months ago, and had a head of very curly grayish brown hair. I&#x27;m 33, so that was not happening. I have had platinum and or white hair before and loved it! I bought 2 of these kits and 2 virgin snow toners at Sally&#x27;s. I got the kit at Sally&#x27;s for 9.99, instead of 10.63. I bleached my 3-4 inches of hair, but couldn&#x27;t even do my whole head with one box. My hair is pretty thick regardless. I ended up using two boxes of the bleach, and had to go back again with purple bleach. My hair chemistry might be different now, and more resistant to bleach, but this made my head somewhat patchy. I did have some incredibly white hair around my face though. Bottom line: I believe this stuff works, and fast, but they need to include a lot more product. The amount is ridiculous. As far as the smell goes, it&#x27;s bleach. It&#x27;s not going to smell amazing.  I still have to go back and bleach once more to get the white I want though. It&#x27;s just not quite there yet.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re gonna wanna buy 2 at least. It burned and steamed but didn&#x27;t make my hair feel gross and dead. Definitely lightened it, but it wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
    <li> Wanted to bleach the ends of purple with red,No recieved it. Oh well I will go  to my beauty girl and have her do it</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Neighbor is hairdresser and does my hair inexpensively and is going to order product for shop.</li>
    <li> Although it did bleach my black hair(only to orange)  it did not bleach my green tips even though i sat there for two hours.</li>
    <li> Three of my friends and I used this to bleach our hair, which ranges from dark blonde to medium brown. None of us had ever bleached hair before, but the instructions were really easy to follow, and everyone&#x27;s came out looking great. We wore gloves, only did pieces of the hair, and didn&#x27;t go all the way up to the roots, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it reacts to your skin.</li>
    <li> i used it to lighten my ombré, it worked really well and unlike other bleach I used it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair too much. It&#x27;s a very small amount of actual product and I couldn&#x27;t cover my whole head if I wanted to. Maybe if you have thin hair it could, but if you have thick hair I would recommend 2 cases.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair a dark brown recently before using this, and it lightened it perfectly and without resistance as I was applying it! Planning on ordering more whenever my roots grow in :)</li>
    <li> I was really happy that the box came with everything - the powder, developer, bowl, brush, gloves, and plastic cap. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even 10 minutes after bleaching my asian dark brown hair, the color started to change to orange! While applying the bleach, I noticed the mix gave a burning feeling in my nose whenever I was near it. I kept the bowl at about an arm&#x27;s length from me because of this. I used the plastic cap for the first 20 minutes or so, then took it off because my scalp had a burning sensation. There was just enough to cover all of my hair (a pixie cut), though I didn&#x27;t use the whole bottle of developer. Being a newbie at this, I noticed I still had some dark-brown patches around my hair after about 30 minutes. It&#x27;s okay though, I think it looks cool! ^_^ While waiting for the product to completely bleach my hair, I&#x27;d occasionally smell the burning fumes from the mix coming from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking to make a quick job of bleaching your hair. It&#x27;ll get dark, dark hair to a light blonde-orangeish color - really light blonde if you saturate the hair enough.</li>
    <li> My developer was open. The box was a mess.</li>
    <li> it did the job but it started to burn my head after 20 min wont use this stuff ever again.</li>
    <li> I shoulda bought 2 of em as my hair is very long and very thick but it works great, it&#x27;s easy to use, and everything I needed was included.</li>
    <li> I really liked this because it didn&#x27;t burn or smell terrible. I left it on for as long as the packaging recommended and it lifted my naturally nearly black hair to a yellow/orange blonde. My hair of course is dryer, but seems to be in better condition than the last time I bleached it with a commercial box brand. If I decide to lift it further I will definitely purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> so... wow. I bought this product expecting my hair to be WHITE. Nice try, manic.... my hair is now a lovely shade of crack-wh*re blonde and i have to go to school in the morning....&gt;&lt; so</li>
    <li> I usually get my hair done by a professional but my usual lady is out on maternity leave and my roots were grown out 2+ inches. I bought this to bleach my roots to do a different wild color than usual and I&#x27;m skeptical bleaching on my own but this stuff was great. Went from dishwaterm brown to really pale lemon in 20min. No damage to hair! Is buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> Your hair will cry. It turned my medium-brown hair a light orange. I had to pay to get it fixed professionally.</li>
    <li> It was super strong and made my head itch somewhat because of the intensity, but i t got the job done and besides slight discomfort while bleaching my head is relatively unscathed and my hair is still healthy</li>
    <li> All the reviews I read noted that there isn&#x27;t a lot of product so I bought two boxes in case. Well, the reviews were right. I have fine hair that&#x27;s a few inches past my shoulders and two boxes were not enough to fully saturate my hair. After the process, my hair was patchy since I didn&#x27;t have enough product to distribute evenly through my hair. I love that it&#x27;s a vegan, cruelty free product but very expensive for little product. I had to go out to Sally Beauty and purchase another packet of hair bleach which mind you only cost me $3.50 + the price of developer making Manic Panic twice as expensive as their competitor!</li>
    <li> Not what it should be ...I should have just gone to the beauty supply store and get the products needed. after 25 mins no change in hair color...complete waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> The box was basically smashed but it didn&#x27;t affect the product .. worked for my hair I should have bought two tho ..</li>
    <li> Works great! Got dark brown hair to near true blonde on first use.  Does not smell horrible like some bleaches do.  Will make your head itchy/burn.</li>
    <li> I have been bleaching and dying my hair fun colors for about 11 years now and have tried many kits.  This one is by far my favorite.  It is potent and doesn&#x27;t leave me needing to bleach my hair twice to get the lightness I desire (I have super dark brown hair naturally),  It works well and you don&#x27;t have to use all the contents if you don&#x27;t wish to.  If you have short hair or only want to bleach a few chunks, you don&#x27;t have to waste $10~15 on a bleach kit that will cause you to waste most of it because it requires you to mix all the contents to reach the right chemical balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can leave your hair feeling a bit wiry if you don&#x27;t nourish it after, but just use some good conditioner or some enriching serum and your hair will be just fine after.</li>
    <li> This kit comes with the bleach powder, a tub and brush, gloves, and developer. I had to get two kits to achieve the color that I wanted (my hair is medium brown), but I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product so I could bleach the tips of my hair (so I could dye them purple). I have dark brown hair so I had to leave it on for about an hour and twenty minutes (it says to do 60 - 90 minutes for dark brown hair). It comes with a plastic hair net thing that you have to put your hair in so the dye doesnt get on anything. It worked great and the purple looks amazing. It brought my hair to a shade that is just right for brightly colored hair dye. I bought special effects hair dye though, not manic panic. I love it! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a hair lightening product that lightened as fast as this stuff.  I have very dark hair I left it on for about 20 minutes and my hair lifted about 4 shades. I have noticed some damage near the ends so I panicked and decided to rinse it out. I am very pleased with this product. One thing that bothered me was the instructions. It didn&#x27;t say how much volume to mix into the powdered bleach. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was supposed to mix the whole bottle or just half. Maybe that&#x27;s why my hair lifted so quickly because I just mixed the whole bottle.. Either way, I am happy about this purchase.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S AMAZINGLY AWESOME, I LOVE IT SO MUCH, IT WORKS PERFECTLY, IT WILL EFINETLY GIVE YOU THE RESULTS YOU WANT</li>
    <li> This one was amazing.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, left in hair for 2 hours and went from black ta perfect blondish hair.</li>
    <li> Got it on time, a great product</li>
    <li> When I bleached my hair with this it made my hair canary yellow with orange tints.Its fine beccause I dyed my hair a different color after that, but otherwise it wasnt the greatest.</li>
    <li> By the reviews, I was sure this would work better for me than a lot of the bleach kits found at the drugstore. I have really THICK long, wavy dark brown hair and can have a difficult time lifting the color due to the thickness. It did work, but left my hair very orangey (similar to many other brands), even after multiple applications. Probably would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS AND I LOVE IT...IT GETS MY HAIR REALLY WHITE AND READY TO TAKE ON NE COLOR I CHOOSE. BE SURE TO OIL THE FRONT OF YOUR HEAD TO AVOID BURNS.</li>
    <li> I was worried it might not have any effect on my hair since I&#x27;m Korean, though my strands aren&#x27;t as thick as some of my other Korean friends, but it did alright. It got my hair as light as a peanut, and my hair was very receptive to the hot pink coloring I colored it with. Another bleach-in-a-box I got from the supermarket was only able to get my hair as light as pear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning to others though -- make sure to spread your hair out into several separate clumps when bleaching: the chemical reaction generates heat and it can get really hot under there.</li>
    <li> Worked extremely well. My hair was a little dry after using it, but that was expected. All I did was deep condition after. I&#x27;m black with black hair, and it worked perfectly. I also didn&#x27;t experience any changes in my curl pattern. I do recommend buying more than one box. I have medium legnth hair and I found myself stretching it. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I have many different colors in my hair natural and dyed. Brown&#x27;s. And purples...This striped all the different colors to BOLD BLONDE in 30 minutes. LOVE it!!!. The people that could not get this to work might have used too much developer. I mixed to dryer paste and it really lifted every color highly recommend this. I will use it again. I put more strips in. Order a few boxes if doing entire head. This was enough to stripe my thick  elbow long hair a half dozen stripes.</li>
    <li> Love this bleach! I have (had lol) darker brown hair, and in order to get it to the place where I can dye it blue, I bleached it twice, perfectly using all the solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  Worked really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  Burned a bit, but the instructions said it might and it was completely bearable.</li>
    <li> I am always changing my hair color and this is my goto for lightening. Pulls out any rainbow you let slip onto your head! Great stuffs.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Leaves your hair a light blonde that dye goes over easily. I would reccomend this product but I would only get this size if you have shorter hair. I have long hair and it wasn&#x27;t enough to do all my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted to bleach her hair first, before dying it blue (for Halloween, naturally). I ended up applying it to her long hair. We used two bottles. This stuff is strong-so strong, that I highly recommend wearing either something white, or something you don&#x27;t give a fig about. My application took about half an hour or more, and the bleaching was visible as I worked. We opened a window before I started. Very strong smell coming from the bottle. If I wasn&#x27;t careful around her roots, the bleaching chemicals made her scalp itch badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you want your dark hair lightened a lot, use this stuff!  (make sure you have plenty of ventilation!)</li>
    <li> Id rate it a 5, it came in before schedule and it was in good condition everything I wanted was there, it also came with a little card promoting the business I ordered the product from and it even gave me a little individually wrapped swedish fish candy &amp;#60;3 it was cute and really nice.</li>
    <li> Even before I had finished applying this bleach my hair was changing colors. It didn&#x27;t take long to get the desired lightness I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.. it lightens the so great. will order this again probably for my friends too that want their hair light. makes a pretty shade of Blonde.</li>
    <li> I would recommend you only use this for streaking and not all over application. It&#x27;s bleach, so it&#x27;s definitely going to sting a bit, but this stuff is powerful. I have a few small scabs on the back of my head where too much bleach reached the skin. However, I will say that it really works, at least on medium brown hair. I had dyed my hair dark red a few weeks before applying this, and it lifted my roots to a light yellow within minutes. The rest of my hair lifted to a pink lemonade color. So be warned, if you have red hair, don&#x27;t expect any miracles from this stuff. Again, only use this on small spots, don&#x27;t do a full head application like I did. It burnt and itched so bad, that I was afraid my hair was going to just fall out. After washing it, I would say that it&#x27;s definitely unhealthy, but not horrible. You should probably start off with decently healthy hair to begin with. Great bleach, very powerful, not for redheads.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product. I havent dyed my hair in nearly 8 months and yet this color still turned my hair red/orange/blonde/white. Ive dyed my hair before and know how to do it. I ended up driving to the store and getting a dark color to fix it. I got my money back for this item. Just go to a salon and call it a day.</li>
    <li> This worked out really good.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I think that I will get this again.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait until then.</li>
    <li> Kit came quickly and did just as expected!</li>
    <li> Product had been opened previously.  Missing accessories.  Leaking in package.  Not worth trouble to return, threw away.</li>
    <li> Great kit to bleach hair. It was only enough for half of my hair though so I had to buy another one. So if you have a decent amount of hair I suggest you buy 2 or more packs!</li>
    <li> The box was crushed when I got it. Super messy, burns if you don&#x27;t watch it closely. I would recommend NOT bleaching your hair after using this product, since it was messy and painful. If a friend was asking me about this, I would tell her to go to a hairdresser rather than use bleach.</li>
    <li> Only bleaching kit I will use. It doesn&#x27;t burn. It does what it says. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> I accidentally got the wrong volume of peroxide (i wanted 30) but I mixed this up with an equal amount of shampoo and found this no more damaging than 20 volume and it lifted quickly. It covered my thick, midback length hair with some to spare. The best part is this is the only bleaching kit I&#x27;ve found that does not test on animals! :D I&#x27;d definately purchase this again when I feel the need to bleach my hair. :}</li>
    <li> Like so many other gals, I&#x27;ve tried every hair product on the market. My hair was a red/brown mess, and I wanted just plain red hair again (I know, so trendy). Considering my time was limited, I didnt leave the bleach in as long as recommended for my hair color. Even still, within minutes of application, I could see my hair lightening up, and after washing it out &amp; drying, my hair was super blonde, with only a little orange (because of the original red). I would absolutely use this product again, and I will definitely recommend it to anyone in need of a bleaching product. A++</li>
    <li> My hair is white around my face. After much research and blogs, I ordered and tried this product. First time took an hour with cap. Second time touch up only took 20 minutes on my roots with a brief addition to some yellowish ends. My hair is short and would recommend 2 kits. It dries quickly on short tapered hair. Always wear the cap for month to month touch ups and keep well bellow your hairline if you have very short hair. Love my results. Took 2 applications, with a few days interval to get hair completely white. Keep your hair moisturized with hair conditioner after rinse, and after every shampoo. My hair is fine in texture. Always strand test if in doubt.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have enough bleach to bleach my entire head but other than that everything went swimmingly and I followed up with rock ability blue manic panic hair dye. To give you some sort of idea, I had to use two containers of that to dye my entire head, or the part that was bleached.</li>
    <li> I believed this was a great product! I have naturally black hair but I had dyed it several times. Before bleaching my hair, my color was a dark brownish red. I am in the process of going to do a purple/pink ombre soon so I need to lift my color and I must say this did a great job! I left the bleach in for about an hour in the provided hair cap in the kit. My hair is now brown near the roots and a light brown at the ends.I am very pleased with my results. Also, I wouldn&#x27;t know if my hair was really brassy because I did purchase purple shampoo to combat that. But even then, I&#x27;m sure I would have been satisfied still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, and the reason that I gave it only four stars, is that there was not a lot of product. I definitely did not have a enough to do my whole head but I am doing an ombre style so it was fine with me. I only have just a tad longer than shoulder length hair and it is also very thick so it&#x27;s a given for me that I ran out, with hair dyes. But, If you have longer hair than mine, I would suggest getting more than one box.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product years and years. If you have long hair or dark hair you&#x27;ll need two or three of them.  don&#x27;t waste your time with the 30 vol,  maximum damage necessary to the strand so it soaks up the color of your choice.  have a really good conditioner when you do it and don&#x27;t wash your hair for three days after you color it.  do condition it day 1 and 3, It will be dry, don&#x27;t go crazy pulling knots out with the brush/comb. its better to cut the knot out than get really blasted hair broken on a linear plane of the strands. ; if you want to bleach, this is besty.</li>
    <li> The actual product was good, but I have really short hair, about three inches long, and one box wasn&#x27;t enough. I do have thick hair but really? If I ever dye my hair again I guess I know to buy two boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my roots bleached to a nice blonde,  every other part of my hair is orange. If I had eniugh of the product my hair would have all been boonde in one sitting. And it was black before. It also didn&#x27;t damage my hair at all but I used some special shampoo and conditioner to wash it iut, the stuff you get in other hair color boxes. But it did irritate my scalp pretty bad, but no sores.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use, had a great result. Like it the best out of all hair bleach I have tried.</li>
    <li> f you&#x27;re new to bleaching and you need a little kit that has everything you need then this is the kit for you, If you need to do your whole head, this will not cover everything. I recommend you get salon quality bleach at a beauty store. Also salon quality bleach is better than the manic panic one. I found at the manic panic bleach fries my hair, It literally sizzles in the tin. Bottom of the lien is, if you are only doing a few highlights or strips of hair, this is good, but if you need to bleach the whole head, get salon quality bleach and developer seperatly, otherwise this is an okay choice, gets the job done.</li>
    <li> It works about the same as any other bleach for your hair. Came with instructions so it&#x27;s good for people who might not necessarily know what they&#x27;re doing.</li>
    <li> It lightened  my hair but not as much as I thought it would.  I plan on trying  it again sometime.</li>
    <li> This bleach, by far, is the best I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. I have very thick, dark colored hair and this bleach does a pretty good job of bleaching compared to other brands that leave my hair either a dark blond or light brown color. The only problem I have with this product is how it&#x27;s been shipped and handled a couple of times. The bleach or developer will sometimes be open and it ends up burning my fingers when I take it out of the package. This product isn&#x27;t always like this, but last time it came sort of opened and messy.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I never bleached my hair before but this was easy and worked well. Only took 20 minutes to get my brown hair to pale yellow. Came with everything needed.</li>
    <li> Heard good things, wanted to try it in order to dye hair colorful colors.&lt;br /&gt;Came exploded. Unusable. Sadface. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I have true black hair. I went to the hair salon and they werent even able to bleach my hair like this product did.&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for 50 mins and it became super blonde. Eventho my hair became a lil dry, but it didnt break off, not even near breaking off, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing hihtlights myself is a pain, so i bought more for the next time when i go to hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> I tried this a long while back, it gave me serious damage (which I know bleaching causes) however this one gave me more and it gave me orange hair!!!!! no bueno</li>
    <li> I bought this item and it came fast befor the set date and I used it on my hair and I have really dark brown and it turned it bright blond I love it I&#x27;m defiantly gonna be buying more</li>
    <li> this was the easiest to use and lifted the color out of my 1B hair pretty quickly!  I had to have it on for the full 90 minutes but the results were awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a really good brand. They sell this at HOT TOPIC.</li>
    <li> ive got some very dark hair, but 2 applications of Flash Lightning had me ready for hot hot pink.</li>
    <li> So I got this bleach kit really early so I loved that. And when I used it, I used it to bleach all of my hair. I dont know, but to me bleaching your hair this was not bad at all. My hair was really like black/darkbrown and I was able to bleach it, but because I have a lot of hair, it didnt bleach all of it, so I should have ordered two. Other than that, I loved the product, And my hair didnt get damaged, just really dry but thats expected when you bleach your hair.</li>
    <li> I have ombred hair and I have about 4 inches of hair which is my natural dark brown hair color. I did NOT even get to dye all of my 4 inches of natural brown hair. More like 2 inches, and that is pushing it. I do not know why I bought this, I honestly regret it ughhhh. IT TURNED MY HAIR BRIGHT ORANGE!!!! And with such a little amount, I just do not understand....I never review, but I just have to save someone! Do not be like me, don&#x27;t be lazy, go to sallys!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Way cheap that buying it in store and it definitely helped to bleach my hair. I have very dark brown/black hair and in two or three uses I had almost a platinum blond.</li>
    <li> Wonderful experience with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;Although the portion is really small.&lt;br /&gt;The overall results is good for those who wish to look good and at the same time save cost!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when the package arrived, the portions are small tho. I don&#x27;t think I could dye my whole hair with it if I chose too. I also didn&#x27;t receive any gloves or a tub. Everything else was there, and I&#x27;d say it shipped pretty quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I DO recommend manic panic to anyone who is a newbie because their instructions are very specific with no big words or anything I need to read.</li>
    <li> I bought the flash 40 from Manic Panic&#x27;s website to use on my inky black permanent color before using manic panic hot hot pink. First off, I was shocked by how little mix there was compared to how much it costs...think a packet of jello...not the BIG packet of jello, but the small one. So I was attempting stripes in my inky black so I knew I needed a total bleach out. This stuff did the trick. There were a few \\&quot;operator errors\\&quot; such as dripping bleach on parts  I had hoped not to bleach, and being an idiot and not removing the clip after putting the bleach on leaving an orange stripe where the clip was. That&#x27;s Mi culpas! So I put on the bleach, decided to change up my plan after the drips and included the bangs. I had barely enough bleach to cover my bangs and 2 2inch stripes on either side of my above shoulder bob. Granted, I do have thick hair, but what a disappointment that there wasn&#x27;t more for the $. I left it on, under the shower cap, for about 40 mins and immediately saw that my inky black had changed to a lemony yellow. After leaving it on an additional 15 mins, it went to white and ombred down to a lemony yellow at the tips(not ruling out another human error) so I toned it with Manic panic&#x27;s virgin snow after washing out the bleach and it was a PERFECT blank canvas of white! Perfect for laying on my hot hot pink and getting the look I wanted! :-) Overall, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, but beware, you aren&#x27;t getting much product, so if you&#x27;ve got thick, long, or thick and long hair, you are going to need multiple kits, however , if it&#x27;s just for a bangs or a stripe job, probably just right!</li>
    <li> t the ago of 67, I grew a very full beard which was gray-white. In late November, I realized how close I was to being a dead ringer for Santa, so I bought Manic Panic to complete the picture. Everything above the neckline was treated, including my eyebrows. I let the first coat set for 90 minutes, rinsed it, then touched things up with a second cost. The eyebrows took three coats, being somewhat darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result was a snowy white Santa beard. Little children now smile broadly when they see me at Food Lion. Even my 25 yo son and elderly friends call me Santa. My companion insists that I accompany everything with my red pants, reindeer sweater, and red fedora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning: there was a fair amount of skin irritation on my face, but it subsided after a day. The scalp was much less affected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month, there was some yellowing. A hairdresser friend assured me that this was normal and recommending  bluing agent like Shimmering Lights to restore the whiteness. That seems to work. After about six months, I will repeat the bleaching to prepare for next Christmas</li>
    <li> I love this so much I have very black hair I was worried it wasn&#x27;t going to work on my hair but surprisingly it did! This was my first time bleaching my hair and even though I ran out of bleach I still love how blonde it made my hair! I&#x27;m going to re do my hair so it&#x27;ll look better :3 if you have very long thick hair buy two boxes because you will most likely run out like I did ;-;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all good except for the fact that there is not enough. Buy more than two if you have black or dark brown hair... you will probably need it if you are covering your whole head and have any appreciable amount of hair. Perhaps three or four if you have a lot of hair and it is black or dark brown. The bleach does what it is supposed to just fine. It lifts a lot of colour and is relatively fast. It got me from black to light brown (used it on my whole head; I have medium-length hair by male standards). Helpful hint: use the cap and apply/retain heat. That will make the bleaching faster and more effective. Of course, like any bleach, it is damaging. Luckily, most vegetable-based hair dyes replenish your hair to some degree. Use something to protect your skin from the harsh bleach. Vaseline is okay for that purpose. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll get peeling but unappealing (pun intended) skin.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair and while this did take in some places, it did not take in other places. Honestly, when I opened it, I did not feel that there was enough bleach in there, at all. This worked on my hair when I was younger so I am not sure what has changed in the past years.</li>
    <li> The only reason I deducted a star was sue to that fact that I wish the mixture was blue or a color you can see like other bleach kits.. because once you start applying (especially if you&#x27;re doing a chunk or highlights like I did) it&#x27;s white-ish clear &amp; blends in with your hair so you can&#x27;t make sure you&#x27;ve got it all covered. Other than that I highly recommend this as an inexpensive all-in-one kit. Admittedly my hair was so dark it needed a 2nd round of bleach (I wanted a pastel peekaboo streak) and I ended up going to Sally Beauty instead of getting another kit cause I realized I might be using this forever &amp; wanted my bleach supplies in bulk. But this is a GREAT kit for a single job on lighter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the best part? I was so scared about bleach frying my hair as I&#x27;ve heard my share of horror stories. Just make sure to deep condition whatever you bleach afterwards &amp; it&#x27;s smooth as silk! No damage!</li>
    <li> For me having a dark brown hair..it just took 20-45mins depending on the amount you put.. But i wish i bought 2 bleach kit for full coverage ,because i have long hair...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this bleach before and I have to say that it&#x27;s great. I use to use splat which really isn&#x27;t the best for bleaching and coloring. But this worked wonders for me. I love it especially if your going for the real bright colors than its super recommended</li>
    <li> Best lightener out there.  Takes me from black to blonde in 90 minutes!</li>
    <li> Please disregard any negative review if it posted. I was able to locate all parts off the kit after I found it my children had opened the box first.  Product works great!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re needing to bleach a lot of your hair (going for an all over color), be sure to pick up several boxes. Each box makes a small little bowl of bleach. So even if you have very short hair, you&#x27;ll probably find you&#x27;ll need several boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to prep my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s hair for some Manic Panic colored streaks. We had initially had some colorful extensions put in at the salon, but some of them started falling out the very next day. So we decided just to color the streaks in. She has medium brown hair and in no time at all this Flash Lighting turned her hair into the perfect light blond color. Her hair must have been just the right shade of brown because she had no yellow tones at all in it. I however have super dark brown hair and when I get my hair bleached each month at the salon, I have the typical warm tones in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sectioned off a portion of the underside of her hair and applied the Flash Lighting, then folded it up into a foil to keep it separate from the rest of her hair. 10 -15 minutes later she washed it out and she had the perfect non-yellow light blonde section of hair ready for applying color. I applied a dark pink, a violet color and a turquoise blue and wrapped them up in foils. She washed them out later and the color came out amazing. Looked 100 time better than the extensions (which were real-hair extensions too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Manic Panic Amplified Flash Lighting works really well and fast. Just be sure to get enough so that you don&#x27;t run short if you&#x27;re bleaching a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> I will never buy this again. It wasn&#x27;t horrible, just not the best at all. It bleached fine and didn&#x27;t burn much (I have an easy time with bleach) but I have better results with stuff I buy from Sally&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also did expand a lot when using it. I&#x27;ve never had that happen before so I was a bit worried, especially when it started coming out of the container. But maybe it was too hot or something.</li>
    <li> My kit didn&#x27;t include any gloves or a cap. The box was also damaged a bit.</li>
    <li> It definitely does the job, it bleaches your hair even dark brown. However, BE FOREWARNED ... If you have long hair (anything longer than a bob) and/or thick hair you will need MULTIPLE kits. I have very long and thick hair, and one kit only covered about a 1/4 of my hair! I am stuck having to completely cover my head when in public (lest I scare the villagers!) because only the hair surrounding my my face is bleached. So, now I have to go buy at least 2 more... it&#x27;s so not worth buying this product at 10 bucks a pop. For 40 bucks I could either have it ALL bleached at a salon OR buy a pound of L&#x27;oral bleach, a level 40 developer, the manic panic toner to remove yellows from the bleach job, AND the manic panic color of my choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have been using Manic Panic for over 15 years, their dye is second to none when a unnatural color is needed! If you have long hair and/or hair that is thick, find a larger volume of product! If it were less expensive that i would have given it a better rating, However, if I want to dye all my hair it will cost between 35-45 dollars for this product alone!</li>
    <li> For the price, the bleach was fantastic. My hair is a very dark brown, and I was able to get it to a vibrant medium blonde after four hours and an entire tub. However, I was going for highlights, and after rinsing the bleach out, all my hair ended up bleached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions were clear and the kit came with everything needed, including a hair net and rubber gloves. The cheap kind that you&#x27;ll need to throw away. I still recommend buying high-quality ones if you&#x27;re actually dying your hair. I myself dyed mine green and purple, and it looks great if I do say so myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t worry about the brand. It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;made&amp;#34; by THAT Snooky, if you&#x27;re not aware.</li>
    <li> I used this to bleach out my previous purply-pink color to go blue. Most bleach makes red/pink/purple colors turn orange. This worked really well.</li>
    <li> It works really well, but there isn&#x27;t a lot of bleach powder in the kit. My hair is kind of long it goes a little past my breasts so there wasn&#x27;t enough to cover my entire head. I recommend buying two or going with a brand that carries a bigger size. Besides that It&#x27;s a really great product that acts very fast.</li>
    <li> I used the product as instructed and left it on for 90 minutes as instructed for dark hair.  I rinsed at the end and my hair came out in clumps.  My hair is still falling out.  If you have fine/thin hair - DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.  Go to the salon or risk having to cut your hair very short.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s average hair bleach. I was expecting better since it specifically is to get your hair as light as possible for other color</li>
    <li> I used this bleach to highlight and ombre my hair, which required it to last through a full head of highlights (almost to the root, not all the way) on long hair, and then enough to saturate the bottom of my hair entirely. My hair length reaches half-way down my back, so I found this to provide a lot of bleach. I will let other reviewers speak to the color change, as I had already bleached my hair, but I have naturally dark brown hair and have to use foils to keep the moisture in the bleach to make it really lighten my hair, but this kit worked well to achieve almost platinum blond hair, a little closer to straw color. I did use toners after this to get rid of the slightly yellowy-orange tones.</li>
    <li> This stuff will take you right to white.  It&#x27;s strong stuff so be careful but if you need a quick bleach out, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I didnt even get to use this product because when I got it the cream had completely leaked out of the box.  I told them about it and they said they would send me a prepaid UPS label to send it back to get a refund but I never received one and now im out of my money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use before dying my ends blue. It was so easy to use and had clear instructions. I have naturally medium-dark brown hair and only left it in for about 30 minutes. I don&#x27;t see any damage and that was my main concern. Then only thing I had a problem with was is didn&#x27;t come with very much product. I only did the ends of my hair and I used all of dye. So for anyone out there wanting to do your full head I would buy a few!</li>
    <li> First off, let me explain this: I live in the Bronx where prices tend to be on the cheaper end than most. This review might be biased towards that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my sister INSISTED we both try this bleach kit for our hair, whereas I wanted to just stick with whatever was at our beauty supply store. Here were the results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paid $12.99 for Manic Panic Bleach Kit&lt;br /&gt;Sister: Black hair turned Lightish Brown (She bleached her tips)&lt;br /&gt;Me: Light Brown Hair turned Reddish Blonde (I wanted to bleach highlights on top and the bottom layer of my hair but did not have enough bleach and got only half my head done)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the end, we needed to buy more anyway. We ended up buying L&#x27;Oreal Oreal Developer 30 16 oz. ($3.49) (used 2 oz with the bleach so I still have left over if I ever want to use more) and Oreal 7 Layer Lift Bleach ($2.99) for a total of $6.48 for double the amount we got with this kit. Oh, may I add it turned my hair near white and my sister&#x27;s hair blonde (our goals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bleach kit did it&#x27;s job, but there&#x27;s so little of it and I ended up finding something better for half the price! For that reason, I was not satisfied at all.</li>
    <li> Too little powder! i have a short hair (neck length) and i couldn&#x27;t bleach all of it using one box! If you have a shoulder length hair you probably will need three boxes.</li>
    <li> The liquid bottle was cracked/open, it got all over my hands.  I&#x27;m just lucky this mess wasn&#x27;t completely empty when I got it.</li>
    <li> Just don&#x27;t do it. Go to a professional</li>
    <li> great results in 20 min and they give you enough for 2 aplications</li>
    <li> So, I took a risk. Everyone told me not to bleach my hair myself, but I did it anyway. And it actually turned out pretty well! The bleach made my eyes water a little, but apart from that I had no issues. Easy to use and it didn&#x27;t fry my hair at all. Definitely be sure to cut it with a little (white!) conditioner.</li>
    <li> works great.  It is a bit small for short hair.  I have long hair and I was only dying the tips and still needed another bottle of this stuff.  I would recommend to by two of this product along with the color corrector.  My hair turned really orange and took over 3 color correctors to get the orange out and I still have one more cote of color left.  great for tips of the hair but recommend the blue bleach from sally&#x27;s.  overall good buy.</li>
    <li> Bleach that works good.  My only gripe is that there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of it.  I&#x27;d get a couple kits if your hair is past your chin!  Otherwise, a great product that works great.</li>
    <li> i have used this product before, it is cheaper on here, and i will use it again. works well, and is the only bleach kit that works for me.</li>
    <li> Lightened my hair quickly and evenly! Everything you need comes in this box: gloves, bleach, developer, brush, tub, cap</li>
    <li> It did not come with the developer so I have to go and get some before I can use it...not happy</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t enough to dy all my hair but it worked instantly, within 5 mins it was turning blonde, I recommend this product for people with really short hair.</li>
    <li> I love It :3 Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I cut my hair over the summer and decided to dye it purple. I&#x27;d say it was about an inch or two above shoulder length. I&#x27;m a naturally dark brunette and my hair is a bit thick so to bleach it i bought Manic Panic 40 vol after doing some research and having it suggested by so many people to do the best work. This package didn&#x27;t even cover half of my hair. I would imagine that people with longer hair would have to use at least 3-4 packages (at $10 each that&#x27;s ridiculous!) My hair bleaches a bit brassy (yellow) on normal occasions but what parts of my hair i did manage to get with Manic Panic simply bleached it orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you must waste your money on this product (It&#x27;s MUCH smaller than shown in the picture) then make sure you buy at least 3 for SHORT hair.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing, but the box I received was half torn open and banged up. everything was included, so it was fine, but I expected a sealed package without rips.</li>
    <li> This is the only bleaching kit brand I&#x27;ve ever used and it works well for me. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times. Will use again.</li>
    <li> This is a good bleach that works on dark hair (dark black Asian hair). I did wait a bit longer than the recommended time since my hair is pretty dark.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s always worked pretty well for me.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing! It turn my hair from black to blonde without that orangy look you get after you bleach it. It&#x27;s worth buying! :3</li>
    <li> A decent bleach kit, definitely easier to use than purchasing bleach/developer separately etc. Product is as described! Used on jet black hair, however, only produces at best a pale yellow bleaching. There isn&#x27;t a lot of product so if you have a lot of hair, you may need to buy more than one.</li>
    <li> This box had obviously been gone through and contents taken out. My box was beaten up and missing half of the items listed to be included! Mine didn&#x27;t have gloves, a mixing tub, or a plastic cap! I bought mine from the seller myBeautyWearhouse. I will not be purchasing from them again. The product it&#x27;s self works really well if you&#x27;re planning on staying staying blonde I recommend getting a toner. But it works well at lifting colors :3</li>
    <li> The powder is super grainy and not very fine. When you mix the developer in the powder is still chunky and doesn&#x27;t mix in very well. I have fairly short hair and there wasn&#x27;t enough product to really cover all of my hair.</li>
    <li> Best hair bleach kit I&#x27;ve used. Took out black hair dye that salon bleach couldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I did end up with a reddish/yellowish tint to my hair after bleaching (probably because I had dyed it red several times in past months, though not for at least two months before bleaching) but I used Wella toner (t18, &#x27;White Lady&#x27;), and now my hair is a lovely silvery blonde.  You&#x27;re more than likely going to need two boxes or more if your hair is longer than bob length or particularly thick. It&#x27;s a little inconvenient, but you&#x27;d pay a lot more at a salon. That being said, my hair suffered little to no damage at all using this, and the coverage was smooth and even despite my having never bleached my hair before. It looks salon quality (if you tone it and trim split ends, etc.)  Will definitely use again. I&#x27;ve been a brunette my whole life with occasional attempts at black or red hair, but now I love being a blonde!</li>
    <li> Splat lightener worked as well and was less harsh.</li>
    <li> I bought this to lighten my dark brown hair so I could dye it pink (Special Effects Atomic Pink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first: If you have hair longer than chin length, think about buying two just in case (If you don&#x27;t need it, you just have one for next time!) The reason? There is VERY little powder with this. Plenty of amplifier (I didn&#x27;t even use all of it) but little powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I used it on completely virgin hair. I had grown my hair out for over a year so it was completely dark brown, all natural, and cut it to chin length (a-line bob so shorter in the back) and nearly ran out. I have very fine hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bleach made my hair white over most of my hair, though some spots closer to the ends were a darker yellow (It didn&#x27;t affect my dying process). I covered it with the shower cap and left it on for a little more than 60 minutes just to try to get rid of the yellowed spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While normally this is a sign to take the stuff off, I noticed a mild burning/itching sensation when I left it to sit, but I&#x27;ve experienced that with most bleaches I&#x27;ve used, and I believe it&#x27;s my skin drying out that makes it itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not showered in two days prior as the natural oils protect your skin and hair from being overly damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely use this product again for a self bleach job so long as my hair was all around one shade.  I personally recommend a professional bleach job if you&#x27;ve used product on your hair or if your hair is multiple shades.</li>
    <li> This was a very easy kit to use.  I was using it to prepare hair for a pink color, so I didn&#x27;t have it blond for long, but it definitely did the job.  In about 45min. I had very bright lemony-white hair!  I can&#x27;t comment on how it leaves your hair feeling afterward (mine felt generally fine) or how controllable it is in getting different shades of blond - I just let it sit for a good long while.  I did seem a tiny bit splotchy (some areas lighter or darker than others), but I didn&#x27;t look too closely since it was about to turn hot pink. &#x3D;)  For reference, I have light brown hair (used to be blond!) and it&#x27;s long, straight and not very thick.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair after usin&#x27; this i&#x27;m blond now.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t like the smell, other then that everythin&#x27; is great (:</li>
    <li> was not enough bleach to dye all my ends  but the part it did bleach went well</li>
    <li> The box was battered and torn and looked like someone had thrown it around a bunch! And the cream developer had exploded all over the place and there was hardly any useable product left. Luckily, I had only needed a little bleach, but still, what a rip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual product itself, it was okay. It turned some of my hair really really blonde and some hardly anything at all. Because of this, my dye job looked splotchy.</li>
    <li> It worked fine but the quality is more for a few highlights not your whole head.</li>
    <li> I have just a streak bleached in my hair. I mix a little at a time, and it still works just as well after several months of touch-ups. I follow with a toner to make it less brassy.</li>
    <li> I did have trouble getting the few strands of pink I had left in my hair, but everything else became platinum blonde or light brown like I needed it to!</li>
    <li> When I took the product out of the package it was damaged. It was crinkled up on the corners of the box. Look like someone dropped it a couple of times. The product worked very well.</li>
    <li> My hair lightener arrived with all the product intact.  I believe in reading the reviews that when ordering this product when the weather is below zero, if left in the cold for extended periods the liquid will burst the bottle.  If the mail delivery leaves your packages outside your door, you may have a problem.  The bleach works great without damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> This product did what it was supposed to(mostly) so I can&#x27;t really complain about that. My hair is shoulder length and somewhat thick. I ordered two tubs, and ran out of bleach. My hair was also left really blotchy in the places that i did bleach. If you have never bleached your hair, or someone else&#x27;s hair at home i would NOT recommend this product. I had to go to a salon and spend $80 more dollars on my hair. If your hair is dark do not expect it to go blonde or yellow. Expect it to be a pink/orange/red brassy color. I thought I could do this by myself with the help of my sister but i was wrong. So please reconsider before ordering. If your hair is lighter, this product will probably be perfect for you! Just make sure you buy enough.</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair alone for the first time using this and it came out great. My hair is super dark and a little thick and I was able to get it to a light blonde. Make sure to use something like coconut oil after washing out the bleach to help gain some natural oils back.</li>
    <li> It works way better than the regular one. I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Being an Asian with raven black hair, bleaching my hair is a &#x27;risky business&#x27;. I&#x27;ve tried bleaching my hair with other name brands, but they either turned my hair orange or yellow. After complaining to a friend about how I will never be able to bleach my hair blond blond, she recommended me Manic Panic... and I LOVE IT! Just a bottle (I have a short pixie cut), and less than 30 minutes, my hair was immediately BLOND! Not orange, not yellow, just BLOND! I will continue to stick to Manic Panic&#x27;s bleach kit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it stings a little, but it&#x27;s bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Shipping was super fast!</li>
    <li> If you want that platinum blonde, look no further than this stuff. I used this with a white toner and I had perfect platinum hair in no time. I had to use a little extra though due to my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to remove the \\&quot;Special Effects Atomic Pink\\&quot; from my hair. It had faded a lot and was showing where I had bleached it and I wanted to fully remove the color. I wanted to go to a more natural color, so I decided to bleach all of my hair. It bleached my medium brown hair nicely, however the pink is still there and hasn&#x27;t really lost any color at all. There wasn&#x27;t enough bleach for all of my hair and I also have patches of brown now. I have chin length hair. If you&#x27;re planning on doing your whole head, I recommend buying 2 of these kits at least.</li>
    <li> Package arrived right on time this afternoon. I was very happy with the professional packaging and prompt delivery. And the bleach works GREAT! I am Hispanic and have very thick dark brown hair (almost black but not quite) and when I was halfway done with my head and started working on the other half, the first half was already turning orange! This stuff works FAST and achieved the desired lightening. Now I can put any Manic Panic/SFX color in my hair without worrying about yellow spots messing up the job! Would buy this again!</li>
    <li> Though Manic Panic dye is whatever (doesnt last long) their bleach is the best. My hair is natural black and it wakes me from pure dark to blonde in about 20-30 mins. I&#x27;ve dried other brands and it works better then bleach from salons. It&#x27;s the only thing I buy now</li>
    <li> Somehow the entire text of my review didn&#x27;t post!  I&#x27;m trying again!     My hair is very dark, thick and coarse.  Extremely difficult to lighten.  This did the best out of all brands I&#x27;ve tried. Even through salons.     I only did the very underneath layer, the one box was barely enough. I would have needed four boxes too get my entire head covered.      I wasn&#x27;t looking for platinum blonde. Just light enough to take the electric blue I was going for. So this kit definitely served it&#x27;s purpose.     I left it on a full 90 mins.  The bleach absorbed immediately into my hair-almost before I could even coat the entire sections I was doing. The area closest to my skin,  of course,  bleached best and immediately. The thicker, coarse section was a bit uneven but I blame my hairs consistency not the product.</li>
    <li> EDIT 3/3/14:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;m a noob at hair dye, I reviewed this product a while ago, wrongly assuming I was reviewing the 30 volume Manic Panic bleach kit. I have since ACTUALLY used the 40 volume one, which I will now write a review of here. The review that follows is the correct review for this product, and the review below the break is actually meant for the 30 volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So last year when I used the 30 volume kit, I dyed my ends into a gradient. I started with mostly thick, straight, medium-dark brown hair. I left different parts of my hair in the bleach for 20, 40, and 60 minutes. The parts that were in bleach for 20 minutes turned a light brown and the parts that were covered for the longest turned a nice medium-light blonde color. This was perfect for then adding some Manic Panic dye and being left with a cool colorful ombre/dip dye look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, I went for something similar, but covered more of my hair. Here&#x27;s what the 40 volume kit did that the 30 volume did not:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It burned. The moment I got it on my neck or face or arm (despite wearing gloves and attempting to be very careful) it burned and I had to call someone in to help me wipe it off.&lt;br /&gt;- It damaged my hair. When I dyed my hair last year there was almost no harmful effect, but this year after washing the bleach out my hair was very stiff and straw-like. And I almost never use heat on my hair and use very few products. A few conditions later and it&#x27;s looking mostly normal, but I wasn&#x27;t happy about this because...&lt;br /&gt;- It didn&#x27;t lighten nearly as much as the 30 volume kit did. The ends of my hair ended up covered in bleach for 75 minutes (they say for dark brown hair you can go up to 90) and the parts that were covered for the shortest amount of time had it in for about 30 minutes. My hair now goes from my natural dark brown, to a medium brown, to a lighter brown, to a dark brassy blonde color. I&#x27;m not extremely happy about how light it got, but because of the way it damaged my hair, I&#x27;m scared to re-lighten anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some of this can be attributed to the fact that it is a 40 volume kit and therefore I should have expected the harsh results. But I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the burning and the damage... when it didn&#x27;t even lighten my hair all that much! I should&#x27;ve done better research and done 1 or 2 lightening steps with a 20 or 30 volume instead of jumping right in with the 40 volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some redeeming points: the shade my hair is makes for a nice ombre to walk around in. It&#x27;s definitely more subtle than if I had bleached my ends super light. So that&#x27;s nice, at least. But not great for what my purpose was, which was to later add colored dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided on a whim to do a self-done dip-dye/ombre color on my hair, and everyone recommended I use Manic Panic. I used this bleach kit on my hair, and not only did it come out the way I wanted it to, but it was pretty easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with everything you&#x27;ll need -- a little tub for mixing and applying, a brush, thin plastic gloves, and the product itself. The gloves felt pretty cheap and after my third or fourth layer of bleach (since I was doing ombre) they started to break, but they held up pretty well until then. I&#x27;ll echo what others have said in that if you&#x27;re planning to dye your entire head of hair, and you have a lot of hair, you might want to get two of these bleach kits. I ran out sooner than I thought I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the parts of my hair that were covered in the bleach for a total of about an hour turned a yellow blonde color (my original color is a dark brown) and the parts that were covered in the bleach for about 20 minutes turned a light brown. It made for a really great gradient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this product, and will definitely use it again if I ever plan on bleaching my hair again :)he way it damaged my hair, I&#x27;m scared to re-lighten anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some of this can be attributed to the fact that it is a 40 volume kit and therefore I should have expected the harsh results.

    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but if you have &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; color hair it will probably work fine. My haor color is very dark brown.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order this from Amazon, but I have bought it from the store. We have used this kit at least 5 times, and it works great everytime!&lt;br /&gt;It lightens our hair quicker than other bleaches we have used. Natural jet black hair turned a pale chicky yellow within 35 minutes. Of course processing times will vary, depending on the condition of your hair, etc. But other products usually take around an hour of processing in order to get the hair to the same lightness. And those other products always caused severe damaging because of the longer process time. This flash lightning doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair as much as other products, and it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad. We love this product and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
    <li> this lightened my dark brown hair to a dirty yellow blonde, but for goodness sake don&#x27;t get it on your scalp or you will end up with chemical burns.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Never bleached my hair before, so this was my first time! I used it for a full 90 minutes, my hair is thick and sort of long, and I wanted to get a light blue color when I dyed it. So, I ended up doing 2 rounds. Didn&#x27;t fry my hair, I can barely even tell that it was used! It worked great, and I saw a considerably lighter color in MINUTES. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con was the smell, but it&#x27;s bleach so I knew it would be a little offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: this is my third time bleaching my hair with this stuff now and I love it. I e attached some updates pics to show the new before/after colors. I didn&#x27;t order enough due this time so I&#x27;m waiting on my second lot but it turned out awesome.</li>
    <li> My head was burning so badly that I started to shiver and go into shock. I have used other brands of hair bleach, like L&#x27;Oreal and Clairol, and they always burn a little at first but usually stop after a few minutes. Not this one! I had to rinse it out before I had the desired effect and it still burned for awhile even after washing with cold water and a very mild oatmeal and aloe vera shampoo! If you must use this product, take my advice and keep it away from your scalp.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product, an I would have enjoyed it more if red hair wasn&#x27;t so difficult to bleach. Red hair does NOT like to be any color but red. My only warning is to make sure you are in an open space or have a window open because like all bleaches, it is fragrant in a not-so-good way.</li>
    <li> works great might have to use twice on super dark hair, other than that it is a great product for the $$$</li>
    <li> The new hairdresser I went to didn&#x27;t listen when I said I wanted blonde &amp;#34;chunks.&amp;#34;  She did the expected subtle highlights.  I&#x27;m not a subtle person.  Did the chunks myself with Manic Panic and am totally pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This product certainly Works, but is not for the faint of heart or those with no hair bleaching experience! THis was the first product i tried on my hair (Years ago) and 40 VOL is TOO DAMN HIGH. XD Strand test first! 40 is really harsh and can kill your hair if you leave it on too long! But! Like i said, it also does it&#x27;s job right!!</li>
