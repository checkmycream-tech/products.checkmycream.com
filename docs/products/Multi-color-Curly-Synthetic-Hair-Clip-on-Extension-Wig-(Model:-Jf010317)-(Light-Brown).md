### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>For me there weren´t good at all!!</li>
      <li>They look very very cheap!!!</li>
      <li>Even my hair salon stylist thought that they were beautiful!</li>
      <li>This hair is a perfect match for my hair color!</li>
      <li>I believe it was brown matched perfectly</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s incredibly shiny, and not in a good way.  </li>
      <li>it was great.</li>
      <li>I love these clip in hair extensions!!</li>
      <li>I read over a million times the reviews and belive all the good things people say about them.</li>
      <li>SOO good</li>
      <li>there gorgeous</li>
      <li>and i love how they are one piece!</li>
      <li>I had to dye my own hair, as well as the dye the clip-on.</li>
      <li>They were neat and had some nice curls to them.</li>
      <li>It made the lumps much more visible and tangled up impossibly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You are better off buying a wig from a Halloween store.</li>
      <li>But the only problem is i cant blend it in with my hair that well, like the color matches perfect</li>
      <li>I wish the clips were more sturdy...</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>it took me HOURS to comb the hair it had SO many tangles</li>
      <li>And I also cute a couple inches off.</li>
      <li>and everyone loved it and thought it was my real hair</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s nice for the first hour -.-</li>
      <li>I liked it a lot at first</li>
      <li>After that, they were fine.</li>
      <li>The hairpiece I ordered was \\&quot;Light Brown\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I did not like the mult-color curly hair clip because it was supposed to be light brown hair</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s important to have all the clips secured</li>
      <li>I wanted a light brown piece...  </li>
      <li>&quot; but there was nothing light about it.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Light Brown\\</li>
      <li>and wow they looked so good</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!!!</li>
      <li>I put them on top of my real hair, and used a headband to cover up the front of the extensions.</li>
      <li>They are about 2 shades darker than my natural hair, but they looked nice.</li>
      <li>This was suppose to be a full one piece extention</li>
      <li>the color is a little dark but it looks great when u wear on, good for the price, easy to use and remove..</li>
      <li>I would say this product if very much worth the price.</li>
      <li>it please sale it right</li>
      <li>Thi was my first pair of hair extensions I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
      <li>but it lasted me like 3 days and sheds when you finger it and tangled the first day</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will say this for the seller - they shipped fast!</li>
      <li>but once I got it I was surprised of how nice the hair piece feels especially for it being synthetic.</li>
      <li>Ok, but it took too long coming from China</li>
      <li>just measure your head before you buy lol its not meant for people with average heads its made for very tiny heads</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear them everyday and they are synthetic and besides all the tangling they are pretty nice.</li>
      <li>I found it to be too large.</li>
      <li>and so I used a shine spray by bedhead on my real hair</li>
      <li>I also after they were straight</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to add lots of length and to thicken up thin</li>
      <li>Everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kinda heavy on but worth the fun, I only wear it when I go out n party, not real human hair but looks good</li>
      <li>soft &amp; pretty...</li>
      <li>small light golden streak undertones it its quite shiny</li>
      <li>And the curls bounce right back as they were before hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I then flat ironed (yes FLAT IRON) on a low heat setting and it worked nicely</li>
      <li>As far as my braid - forget it!</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking to leave your hair down for a one-night costume event, you have a larger head, and you&#x27;re willing to back-comb your hair to hide the lumps from the clips, this is a cheap and viable solution.</li>
      <li>dyed it, clearly.</li>
      <li>But ultimately the two matched up very well together.</li>
      <li>As far as the curlyness</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t quite know what to expect when I ordered this clip-on, but when it finally arrived, I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>The only complaint I have is that I ordered the light brown and instead, the hair was a reddish brown.</li>
      <li>I thought that it would be fun to try, but its just a waste of money that I wish I could get back.</li>
      <li>plus they sent me a little pretty socks as a gift... thankssssss</li>
      <li>I have an average to large head, but this more than wrapped entirely around my scalp, making it difficult to hide.</li>

<li> I bought this product hoping to use it to lengthen my shoulder-length hair enough to create a long braid for a Halloween costume.</li>

<li> and I Recomend teasing the hair to hide the clips, then I washed the hair with shampoo and conditioner and then let it dry and combed it out</li>
<li> not what i expected at all.</li>
<li> If you want it for any other reason - forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and it was dark brown.  </li>
<li> Heavy extensions and are not worth the money at all.</li>
<li> It was a tangled mess when it arrived.</li>
<li> The one I received was very dark.</li>
<li> Waste of time money and hope.</li>
<li> I powdered them to reduce the shine, and that&#x27;s where the trouble started.</li>
<li> Speaking of which, it created lumps under my natural hair that were difficult to hide.</li>
<li> WOW you could not tell it was fake</li>
<li> Was not satisfied with this product at all..</li>
<li> so I kept on then once I had combed out all the tangle and cut out with scissors some of the hard tangles</li>
<li> i am small with a small head. :(</li>
<li> Fake hair, disgusting dead color, does not look anywhere near the photo, unable to apply heat.</li>
<li> I hated it because I ordered two of these and that both were completely different</li>
<li> so that&#x27;s kinda sad</li>
<li> Looks overly fake</li>
<li> I thought I would go crazy</li>
<li> I had to return this item as I was unhappy with the quality and the color.</li>
<li> I HATE IT</li>
<li> IT IS THE WORST THING</li>
<li> They look terrible!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> For the price I assumed I was taking my chances on the quality.  It took awhile for the product to arrive but once I got it I was surprised of how nice the hair piece feels especially for it being synthetic. I would say this product if very much worth the price.</li>
    <li> IT IS THE WORST THING EVER DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING I WOULD BUY AGAIN I HATE IT ITS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS</li>
    <li> I recieved the extensions neatly packaged in a plastic bag. They were neat and had some nice curls to them. I powdered them to reduce the shine, and that&#x27;s where the trouble started. After I brushed them out, the extensions proceeded to turn into a giant frizz ball, resulting in me having to cut off about 3-4 inches. After that, they were fine. I put them on top of my real hair, and used a headband to cover up the front of the extensions. They are about 2 shades darker than my natural hair, but they looked nice.</li>
    <li> I did not like the mult-color curly hair clip because it was supposed to be light brown hair and it was dark brown.  As far as the curlyness it was great.</li>
    <li> still waiting  to  get it  ordered it over a  month ago....not  so  please about that at this  moment i wanted it  for a  party</li>
    <li> I thought that it would be fun to try, but its just a waste of money that I wish I could get back.</li>
    <li> soft &amp; pretty...Super fast shipping!!! @;- will order again....I believe it was brown matched perfectly I wish the clips were more sturdy...It was&#x27;nt sown like others.</li>
    <li> I hated it because I ordered two of these and that both were completely different I didn&#x27;t want two different hair extensions in my hare if your going to sale it please sale it right</li>
    <li> Thi was my first pair of hair extensions I&#x27;ve ever bought I opened them and they were a bit tangled then I curled my hair and wore them to church and everyone loved it and thought it was my real hair the color is a medium brown with small light golden streak undertones it its quite shiny and so I used a shine spray by bedhead on my real hair I like how it&#x27;s all one clip it&#x27;s important to have all the clips secured and I Recomend teasing the hair to hide the clips, then I washed the hair with shampoo and conditioner and then let it dry and combed it out it took me HOURS to comb the hair it had SO many tangles I thought I would go crazy but I didn&#x27;t want to give up so I kept on then once I had combed out all the tangle and cut out with scissors some of the hard tangles I then flat ironed (yes FLAT IRON) on a low heat setting and it worked nicely then i put them on and straightend my hair and wow they looked so good but the thing is once you straighten them they will never curl again so that&#x27;s kinda sad I also after they were straight I put them in and side braided my hair WOW you could not tell it was fake it looked SOO good I like them alot I don&#x27;t wear them everyday and they are synthetic and besides all the tangling they are pretty nice.</li>
    <li> Ok, but it took too long coming from China</li>
    <li> Its not as wide as it shoud be, like it dosnt cover enough of your head so it looks weird.&lt;br /&gt;And i am small with a small head. :(</li>
    <li> Fake hair, disgusting dead color, does not look anywhere near the photo, unable to apply heat. Waste of time money and hope.</li>
    <li> They look terrible!! I read over a million times the reviews and belive all the good things people say about them. For me there weren´t good at all!! They look very very cheap!!!</li>
    <li> I love these clip in hair extensions!! there gorgeous and i love how they are one piece! Even my hair salon stylist thought that they were beautiful! But the only problem is i cant blend it in with my hair that well, like the color matches perfect but i just need to curl my hair to get the look...</li>
    <li> This hair is a perfect match for my hair color! Makes me feel like a mermaid! :) it&#x27;s kinda heavy on but worth the fun, I only wear it when I go out n party, not real human hair but looks good</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t quite know what to expect when I ordered this clip-on, but when it finally arrived, I was pleasantly surprised! The only complaint I have is that I ordered the light brown and instead, the hair was a reddish brown. I had to dye my own hair, as well as the dye the clip-on. And I also cute a couple inches off. But ultimately the two matched up very well together. Everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair. It&#x27;s great to add lots of length and to thicken up thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On quality of the hair:&lt;br /&gt;I dyed it, clearly. It didn&#x27;t hurt the hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have washed it multiple times. Again, no harm to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used my blow dryer, no harm. And the curls bounce right back as they were before hand.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used my straightener and curling iron on the hair. The curling iron didn&#x27;t harm it. I put my straightener on a lower setting just in case, no harm done. The only thing with straightening, once you straighten out the curls, they won&#x27;t come back. So you will have to use a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I adore it! I plan on ordering another one for myself and one for my mother!</li>
    <li> It was a tangled mess when it arrived. Looks overly fake</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping to use it to lengthen my shoulder-length hair enough to create a long braid for a Halloween costume. I wasn&#x27;t interested in it for more than one night&#x27;s use, but even at that, I was disappointed. I found it to be too large. I have an average to large head, but this more than wrapped entirely around my scalp, making it difficult to hide. Speaking of which, it created lumps under my natural hair that were difficult to hide. As far as my braid - forget it! It made the lumps much more visible and tangled up impossibly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to leave your hair down for a one-night costume event, you have a larger head, and you&#x27;re willing to back-comb your hair to hide the lumps from the clips, this is a cheap and viable solution. If you want it for any other reason - forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this for the seller - they shipped fast!</li>
    <li> I wanted a light brown piece...  I got a reddish blonde.  I want my money back. I am diassapointed in this product.</li>
    <li> just measure your head before you buy lol its not meant for people with average heads its made for very tiny heads</li>
    <li> I liked it a lot at first but it lasted me like 3 days and sheds when you finger it and tangled the first day but it&#x27;s nice for the first hour -.-</li>
    <li> The hairpiece I ordered was \\&quot;Light Brown\\&quot;. The one I received was very dark. I&#x27;d call it chocolate brown. The box and labels all said \\&quot;Light Brown\\&quot; but there was nothing light about it. Also, it&#x27;s incredibly shiny, and not in a good way.  I had to return this item as I was unhappy with the quality and the color.</li>
    <li> You are better off buying a wig from a Halloween store. Heavy extensions and are not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> the color is a little dark but it looks great when u wear on, good for the price, easy to use and remove.. plus they sent me a little pretty socks as a gift... thankssssss</li>
    <li> Was not satisfied with this product at all.. This was suppose to be a full one piece extention but it was a one piece that just clips in the back..not what i expected at all.</li>
