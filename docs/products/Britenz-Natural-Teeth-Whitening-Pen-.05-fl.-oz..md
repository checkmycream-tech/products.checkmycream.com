### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best whitening product ever!</li>
      <li>This is amazing!!</li>
      <li>Again great product I will buy again and recommend to others.</li>
      <li>This whitener was working great until the pen broke.</li>
      <li>Even the Colgate mouthwash is more effective.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and no rinsing love love it.  </li>
      <li>It has a fresh, pleasant taste too.</li>
      <li>but I now cannot imagine life without BRITENZ. :)</li>
      <li>, even if it takes longer to get a result, I&#x27;m OK with that since I&#x27;m avoiding the pain.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping and good price.</li>
      <li>I have used other whiteners before and experienced good results from them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice thing to do once or twice a year to brighten your smile for a while.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat how easy this is ...</li>
      <li>It might take a while, which is fine.  </li>
      <li>I have never used it alone without crest white strips, but its a great touch up tool.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and no bad after taste.</li>
      <li>Very handy in the purse, and actually immediately brightens teeth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, you can see results after the second use and it&#x27;s perfect for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>My teeth weren&#x27;t stunningly bright, but I definitely noticed a difference.  </li>
      <li>good value&#x27; rather than &#x27;cheap&#x27;.\\&quot; Didn&#x27;t think there was anyone left selling a product that really works and not jacking up the price for every buck they could squeeze out of people!</li>
      <li>And you don&#x27;t have to rinse it out of your mouth, either - it just leaves a clean, fresh taste.</li>
      <li>I was incredibly excited to receive this product and used it right away.</li>
      <li>This product goes on very easily and seemed like such a good idea, but my teeth didn&#x27;t look any different after a week of using it.</li>
      <li>this isn&#x27;t more like the old Crest Night Effects (which I can&#x27;t find anymore)</li>
      <li>Something to really smile about.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so rare that you find a product that does what it says.</li>
      <li>I purchased this at whole foods and couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it started working.</li>
      <li>decent price comparatively... far better than anything else used...</li>
      <li>This whitener helped pretty well.</li>
      <li>It is super easy, and my teeth were not sensitive after.</li>
      <li>Make sure your teeth are dry.</li>
      <li>but it really works.</li>
      <li>It seems that the main ingredient in all over-the counter whitening products is hydrogen peroxide, and therefore it is the bonding agent in which the peroxide is mixed that is important.</li>
      <li>just spend the extra money to get the crest whitening strips, i love those as my teeth were actually whitened and there was no gum issues.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>After a couple of weeks, we both noticed a marked improvement in the whiteness of her front teeth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the same as getting one&#x27;s teeth whitened by a dentist, but then again, this is a whole lot cheaper.</li>
      <li>I want something to whiten my teeth without making my sensitive gums hurt.</li>
      <li>B006JUYTCU Britenz All Natural Teeth Whitening Pen]]</li>
      <li>With this product, I can brush it directly on the front surfaces of my teeth, avoiding the biting surfaces (and lots of pain).  </li>
      <li>but it lasts pretty long.</li>
      <li>With any other bleaching product, I would be in agony right now (even after only a week)...</li>
      <li>Get your teeth professionally cleaned and whitened and avoid such products!!!!</li>
      <li>I bought recently Britenz All Natural Teeth Whitening Pen.  </li>
      <li>barely taste...</li>
      <li>Strips and trays put the gel right on the nerve and after a few uses, I&#x27;m in excruciating pain.  </li>

<li> I bought recently Britenz All Natural Teeth Whitening Pen.  </li>
<li> barely taste...</li>
<li> Strips and trays put the gel right on the nerve and after a few uses, I&#x27;m in excruciating pain.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is that there isn&#x27;t very much product in this applicator</li>
<li> the instructions were not very clear and i did not see any results from using this pen....</li>
<li> would have been ok but expensive and almost no product inside big waste of money.</li>
<li> I use it about every other day and one tube will last me over 2 months.</li>
<li> Have only been using it a few days and have already had a comment about how white my teeth are looking.</li>
<li> I had absolutely NO expectations that this little pen I bought (in a health food store no less) would work.</li>
<li> I think part of the problem is that the gel probably wipes off some when I let my lip back down to cover my teeth (after applying).  </li>
<li> I think it might work a little, but the second pen I bought smells like sweaty shoes.</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t work plain and simple.</li>
<li> I have been using strips for the past few years and I have developed a sensitiveness from them, but I have not problems with this pen.</li>
<li> I grind my teeth at night, so I&#x27;ve worn them down so that the nerve is exposed on the biting surfaces.  </li>
<li> It ran out in less than 4-5 weeks, otherwise I would have given it 4 stars.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
<li> It took a few turns for gel to come out.</li>
<li> which \\&quot;dried\\&quot; a few seconds after brushing it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Oh well, my lesson was learned the hard way.</li>
<li> When they say, &amp;#34;apply a thin layer,&amp;#34; they aren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
<li> This stupid pen was a waste of money and didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
<li> Boy, was I wrong!</li>
<li> Unpleasant, and possibly dangerous?</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
<li> the taste is not so bad</li>

    <li> I have a problem with my two front teeth being stained. This whitener helped pretty well. My only complaint is that there isn&#x27;t very much product in this applicator and I was just using on those two teeth. It ran out in less than 4-5 weeks, otherwise I would have given it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!! The best whitening product ever! It&#x27;s easy to use, you can see results after the second use and it&#x27;s perfect for sensitive teeth. I have been using strips for the past few years and I have developed a sensitiveness from them, but I have not problems with this pen. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and haven&#x27;t noticed any results.  It might take a while, which is fine.  I think part of the problem is that the gel probably wipes off some when I let my lip back down to cover my teeth (after applying).  It&#x27;s too bad this isn&#x27;t more like the old Crest Night Effects (which I can&#x27;t find anymore) which \\&quot;dried\\&quot; a few seconds after brushing it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still rating it 4 stars because of the application method.  I grind my teeth at night, so I&#x27;ve worn them down so that the nerve is exposed on the biting surfaces.  For this reason, I can&#x27;t wear strips or trays.  Strips and trays put the gel right on the nerve and after a few uses, I&#x27;m in excruciating pain.  With this product, I can brush it directly on the front surfaces of my teeth, avoiding the biting surfaces (and lots of pain).  With any other bleaching product, I would be in agony right now (even after only a week)...and I have zero pain so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even if it takes longer to get a result, I&#x27;m OK with that since I&#x27;m avoiding the pain.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife, who has used Crest products for some time. After a couple of weeks, we both noticed a marked improvement in the whiteness of her front teeth. It&#x27;s not the same as getting one&#x27;s teeth whitened by a dentist, but then again, this is a whole lot cheaper. It seems that the main ingredient in all over-the counter whitening products is hydrogen peroxide, and therefore it is the bonding agent in which the peroxide is mixed that is important. This stuff requires no rinsing, which means that the bonding agent essentially dissolves or evaporates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She hasn&#x27;t reported any problems or side-effects, so I have to give the Britenz Tooth Whitening Pen a big thumbs up. Oh yes, the portability of the product, and the ease with which it can be applied anywhere are also solid advantages.</li>
    <li> Works well!  My teeth weren&#x27;t stunningly bright, but I definitely noticed a difference.  It doesn&#x27;t last, of course.  A week or two after using it for its recommended time, my teeth lost their brightness.  It&#x27;s a nice thing to do once or twice a year to brighten your smile for a while.</li>
    <li> This did not whiten my teeth at all. I have used the entire tube and no changes.  I dont even drink coffee or soda so I am not sure why it did work.</li>
    <li> would have been ok but expensive and almost no product inside big waste of money.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. I have used other whiteners before and experienced good results from them. This product goes on very easily and seemed like such a good idea, but my teeth didn&#x27;t look any different after a week of using it. Also, the pen is supposed to contain enough product to last two or three weeks. Mine was totally gone after one week, even though I tried to follow the instructions closely. When they say, &amp;#34;apply a thin layer,&amp;#34; they aren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
    <li> This stupid pen was a waste of money and didn&#x27;t even work. Also, it broke on like the 3rd time I tried to use it. No wonder it&#x27;s so cheap. Oh well, my lesson was learned the hard way. Moral: don&#x27;t be a cheapskate like me and buy something that actually does what it says it&#x27;ll do, because this thing is a piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> This whitener was working great until the pen broke. I have very sensitive teeth and I like this product. I only wish it had not broke. I might give it another try later.</li>
    <li> i had some hope for this pen. the instructions were not very clear and i did not see any results from using this pen.... it actually made my gums inflamed and sore and ended up being so tender that my gums actually got scratched and bled just from brushing my teeth. just spend the extra money to get the crest whitening strips, i love those as my teeth were actually whitened and there was no gum issues.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about a week.  Wife and daughter both commented that they could see improvement.  I asked my dentist, who is a friend, about it and he said it should work.  It is super easy, and my teeth were not sensitive after. It took a few turns for gel to come out. Something to really smile about.</li>
    <li> I like to use this in tandem with whitening strips to get in between my teeth where the strips sometime miss. I have never used it alone without crest white strips, but its a great touch up tool. Its tiny but it lasts pretty long. Make sure your teeth are dry. I wouldn&#x27;t rely on this alone to whiten teeth.</li>
    <li> I had absolutely NO expectations that this little pen I bought (in a health food store no less) would work. Boy, was I wrong! Have only been using it a few days and have already had a comment about how white my teeth are looking. Doesn&#x27;t burn your gums, no trays to use and it couldn&#x27;t be easier - you can do it at your desk at work, in the car - doesn&#x27;t matter! Like putting on lipstick or lip gloss - 3 seconds, max. And you don&#x27;t have to rinse it out of your mouth, either - it just leaves a clean, fresh taste. If you look on Britenz&#x27;s website under FAQ, people say \\&quot;why is this so cheap???\\&quot; Britenz responds with words to the effect of \\&quot;we prefer to say &#x27;good value&#x27; rather than &#x27;cheap&#x27;.\\&quot; Didn&#x27;t think there was anyone left selling a product that really works and not jacking up the price for every buck they could squeeze out of people! It&#x27;s only been a week or so but I now cannot imagine life without BRITENZ. :)</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work plain and simple. I want something to whiten my teeth without making my sensitive gums hurt. This tastes and feels like whitening stuff but doesn&#x27;t make them whiter!</li>
    <li> Have used a different brand pen for whitening teeth.&lt;br /&gt;This pen is gummy on your teeth and does not do the job of the&lt;br /&gt;other brand I have purchased. I threw it away. Sticking with the other&lt;br /&gt;brand.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this product.  It will totally strip the white enamel from your teeth.  Get your teeth professionally cleaned and whitened and avoid such products!!!!</li>
    <li> just got it but im starting to notice my teeth are getting white...the taste is not so bad and i can use it anywhere!!!!</li>
    <li> I know I just got this product but it really works. It&#x27;s so rare that you find a product that does what it says. Easy to use and no bad after taste. Again great product I will buy again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I bought recently Britenz All Natural Teeth Whitening Pen.  It doesn&#x27;t work for me. I don&#x27;t recommend to buy this product</li>
    <li> I purchased this at whole foods and couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it started working. I can tell my teeth are whiter and brighter the same day I use it. It has a fresh, pleasant taste too. I use it about every other day and one tube will last me over 2 months.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B006JUYTCU Britenz All Natural Teeth Whitening Pen]] I like this product. It actually works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;I find that it exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> This hurt my teeth just shortly after application. It must be the peroxide. I had to toss it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat how easy this is ... brush on ... no rinse... barely taste... whitens immediately... decent price comparatively... far better than anything else used...</li>
    <li> Very handy in the purse, and actually immediately brightens teeth.</li>
    <li> I was incredibly excited to receive this product and used it right away. It appeared to start working immediately. I have used a total of 3 times and can see some improvement already. Very easy to use and no rinsing love love it.  Very fast shipping and good price.</li>
    <li> I think it might work a little, but the second pen I bought smells like sweaty shoes. Unpleasant, and possibly dangerous?</li>
    <li> Oh well, this just does not work at all. don&#x27;t waste your money on it. Even the Colgate mouthwash is more effective.</li>
