    <li> My kids love these paints. They work great with a uv light. After use simply take a wet cloth and wipe it off. No residue or skin staining was left behind. These are so fun. Recommend to everyone. The colors are vibrant and can be playful. Perfect additive to a black light part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these paints at a discounted rate in return for my review. The above is my 100% honest review.</li>
    <li> HUGE HIT AT MY DAUGHTERS 13TH BIRTHDAY PARTY!!! Glows Super Bright!! PERFECT under black lights...The kids decorated themselves (their faces and bodies) and some white t shirts i bought them to wear and take home!! I LOVE THAT AFTERWARDS IT WASHED OFF EASILY! OF THEM AND ANY ACCIDENTAL &amp;#34;UH OH&#x27;S&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS FOR HELPING MAKE MY DAUGHTERS PARTY A HUGE HIT!!!!!! THEY LOVED IT!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff was the hit of my daughters 13th birthday black light party!  The kids covered themselves in it!  Had a blast!  Works AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to do face painting for some time so this was perfect for me. I love how bright and vibrant the colors are in daylight/normal light and how bright they glow when under florescent light! I painted a tree like design on my fiance as a test, and it came out beautiful!!!! the weirdest thing happened after my fiance washed the paint off... some of the blue dots remained... kind of like invisible ink. I think it reminded me of getting stamped to go into bars, or events. I just found it interesting that one of the paints did this. I think a little soap and water should get it off, but if it remains I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be any danger or anything like that.  I only tried 3 of the 6 colors and i loved each one. I definitely see these getting used for festivals, Halloween, and other fun activities. I enjoyed getting to paint on people again (I used to do a lot of henna in hs and all through college and beyond) so it was fun to get back into that. I definitely think these are well worth the price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review of the product. All thoughts here are my own. :)</li>
    <li> I have always doodled.. I doodled on my skin and clothes when I was a kid. At first my mom got upset, especially when I colored all over a brand new pair of Levi&#x27;s. Then she just shrugged and told me I was the one that had to wear them in public and I was NOT getting new jeans! That was okay with me because I liked my doodles and my jeans were unique!&lt;br /&gt;Glow in the dark things have always intrigued me. And they are just so darn fun! I was thrilled when I got the opportunity to review these UV Reactive Body Paints from Neon Glow. They are SO much fun!! I wish something like this that was permanent had been around when I was coloring on my jeans!&lt;br /&gt;These paints go on smooth and are very easy to work with. there were no lumps or bubbles. They are bright in the containers and they are bright on skin. Even in regular light or daylight they are BRIGHT!&lt;br /&gt;These paints are black light reactive, meaning they don&#x27;t just glow in the dark if you turn off the lights, but they come alive with the use of a black light! However, they are so bright, you could easily use this great paint for daytime fun without a black light.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked that a little went a long way with these. I squeezed out a large drop of each color and was able to paint the designs on my arm, face, nails and still had some left to streak through my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention how FUN this is? Just playing with it made me want to throw a party! I see all kinds of fun opportunities from summer fun to themed parties to Halloween parties.&lt;br /&gt;You could even paint on poster board or a canvas and make your own black light wall art. I would think you would want to put some kind of clear sealer over it. I am going to experiment with that though!&lt;br /&gt;The paints are non-toxic, and have no odor. It washes off super easy with just soap and water and did not stain my skin, hair or nails at all. I used it on my face, but it it not recommended for use on or around the eye area and it is not for ingestion so you should be careful when using on children.&lt;br /&gt;You get six super bright, neon colors in this pack. It includes red, blue, pink, yellow orange and green. Each bottle is 2 ounces and as I mentioned a little can go a long way, so you can get a lot of coverage with these. I can&#x27;t use the words FUN enough! I love these paints!should be careful when using on children.&lt;br /&gt;You get six super bright, neon colors in this pack. It includes red, blue, pink, yellow orange and green. Each bottle is 2 ounces and as I mentioned a little can go a long way, so you can get a lot of coverage with these.

    <li> Very good product. It glows great and are bright colors. Just what I was looking for. And the customer service was great. The company sent me emails to keep me updated and even sent me good tips to using the product. It arrived on time and I am completely satisfied with this transaction</li>
    <li> Not only is it black light reflectiv, but it also glows the same color, so it&#x27;s not all green under the black light.</li>
    <li> Perfect for parties, we took this with us to a music festival and it was so much fun to have. The paint stays on well, and didn&#x27;t hurt my skin. It also washed off easily. The color is really bright with the black light. I would recommend this to anyone. Super fun!</li>
    <li> This product was amazing! We had a black light glow party for my daughters 16th birthday and the colors showed up in a fabulous way! Teenagers had a blast with it and adults were impressed!</li>
    <li> High quality. Very visible even without a black light.</li>
    <li> These neon glow body paints are so much fun!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these for my 3 nephews. They love to draw, and sometimes are allowed to color on Mom and Dad&#x27;s tattoo&#x27;s. So when I saw this, I had to get it. How cool to draw and use the black light to see it all glow!&lt;br /&gt;The 3 of them ages 7,10,12 had soooooo much fun it&#x27;s crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adults had fun too. Look at the cool designs they tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So very cool. These pic&#x27;s were taken with a small blacklight in the bathroom, because they wanted to get a good glow effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of paint is perfect!They still have paint left over and they were drawing and creating for hours!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say, you will not be disappointed. I mean look at the videos and photos here. Awesome, awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artists, kids, adults, young or old, whoever you are, as long as you have a black light available to utilize the glow ability, you will have a blast creating art!! Fun art!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this on a promotional offer to test and give my opinion of how well it worked for me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t stopped using this since I got it. The paint is so bright and vivid. Each color does indeed glow under black light, Ive been painting my daughter,and nieces, and then giving them glow sticks. They love playing with it.  The paint dries quickly, and washes off easily. Nor is it flaky, or irritating to the skin. Lasts for hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
    <li> Great product. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for body paint.</li>
    <li> Good product, shipped fast</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:a16b81b9fc061925ff9a60a06916551b]] These paints are SO MUCH FUUUN!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, as an adult, I KNOW I am not supposed to like drawing or coloring on myself, and in my head I hear my mom screaming at me not to do that, but THAT makes me want to wiggle my preverbial fingers at her while shoved in my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being an adult DEFINATELY has it&#x27;s perks... THIS is one of them!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glow in the dark body paint... Let me try and find a negative... Waaaaait foooooor iiiiiiit... Nope! I HAVE NONE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you like the video and if not, please remember what it was like the first time you did something you weren&#x27;t supposed to do and totally got away with it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For ME, that was drawing on myself, lol. :)&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a discounted rate for an honest review and I am SOOOO glad because I AM HAVING SO MUCH FUUUUN!!!</li>
    <li> The glow in the dark body paint is beyond the coolest paint I have seen in a long time. It is so easy to apply to your skin or even if you want to use it on paper or the walls. What I really like about this paint is how easy it was to wash off of my kids after we were done playing. We had a lot of fun playing glow hide n seek. When using this paint you don&#x27;t need a lot of the paint because a little does go a long way. Also the colors turn up a very vibrant color in the black light which is really pretty awesome.  I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> Bottles are way too small for the price.... Almost $45 for 6 tiny bottles of body paint is insane...</li>
    <li> Worked very well. Washed easily. Got many compliments.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed... Was advertised as glow in the dark but was only uv responsive. Didn&#x27;t realize until kids at our party asked me why they weren&#x27;t working.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool! Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is great paint!  I use it with my black light headbands from littlelightlab.net and it works very well, especially the yellow.</li>
    <li> Worked great! The kids had a blast painting themselves and dancing under the black light.</li>
    <li> Absolutely does NOT glow in the dark!!!!!! The description says glow in the dark, the package says glow in the dark, the bottles sayS BLACKLIGHT REACTIVE. Very disappointed since this is not what I needed.</li>
    <li> Glowed very brightly under our UVA BLB blacklights.  Very happy with the product and the shipping.</li>
    <li> This paint was great! Really did glow very bright and works in even poor black light lighting! Loved it would buy again!</li>
    <li> I thought these would be a fun alternative to using regular paints when my girls and I do craft time. They enjoy painting and it&#x27;s always exciting when you can add a new element to an almost tired-out craft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are non-toxic water based paints and my girls are old enough to not put everything into their mouth, so we decided to paint with these (though they are still little and love painting themselves more than the paper) and have a dance party under black light. They were so amazed that they were glowing and painting in the dark was simply mind-blowing to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paints washed off well when they were still wet. We didn&#x27;t see them dry completely, since it was on them, but some did get left behind on my arms that came off with light scrubbing later on in the evening and I didn&#x27;t notice any staining of the skin or bathtub while washing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a great touch at a kid&#x27;s party in place of the normal face paint. So I am definitely going to be picking more up for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> bought these body/face paints because of the photos and the reviews.  the paints look great in the bottles, the first thing you notice is that there is very little difference between the red and the pink under the blacklight -- both a red color. this is not a problem because you can add a little blue to the pink on your body or mix in a dish and get a true shade of pink,  adding more blue gets you many shades of pink, magenta and hot purple !!  what fun!!  if you mix the blue with the red you get a more sunset/coral shade up to a dark purple. there is enough paint here to experiment in this way-these paints work great on tee shirts too. ok so I tried mixing the blue and green and got great shades of teal, aqua and denim .  it was so much fun.  ok things are cookin&#x27; now so I try globbing on the paints as opposed to spreading  them on thinly, letting them dry then adding a second coat. next thing you notice is that the green and yellow are very similar just a shade or two apart--I haven&#x27;t found a solution to making the green greener except by adding blue to it.  now I notice it doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry especially the thin coats-great--toddlers and young kids will get squirmy--put them in front of a fan problem solved.  ok here&#x27;s  the only problem .  to really test it I moved around and rubbed on the paint after a while it starts to crack and flake.  this is most noticeable with the globbed on thick coats the flakes make kind of stars on the unpainted skin which is pretty.  the thinner coats fare better but not by much.  the double coats never look as striking as the globbed on coats so there&#x27;s the rub [,pun intended] I had these paints on for hours and looked at them closely with a blacklight  flashlight .the mixed paints were not as vibrant as the straight ones.  I docked the star for the flaking and cracking-another set i&#x27;m reviewing has white[light blue] and purple [hot pink/ magenta]  in the set and it also cracks &amp; flakes .  I don&#x27;t have a big blacklight  right now, so i&#x27;m  gonna guess that they look just as good if not better @ a glow party or nightclub and i&#x27;m gonna also suppose that all the paints will eventually crack and flake. these paints wash off skin very easily w/ water or soap and water so i&#x27;m going to also suppose that they will wash out of clothes too. these paints are a very good bargain-you get a lot of paint compared to some sets you only get 1/3 of an oz each and some don&#x27;t even state the oz so it&#x27;s a surprise when it arrives.  i&#x27;ll keep looking for a five star &amp; review some other glowing stuff too.t now, so i&#x27;m  gonna guess that they look just as good if not better @ a glow party or nightclub and i&#x27;m gonna also suppose that all the paints will eventually crack and flake. these paints wash off skin very easily w/ water or soap and water so i&#x27;m going to also suppose that they will wash out of clothes too. these paints are a very good bargain-you get a lot of paint compared to some sets you only get 1/3 of an oz each and some don&#x27;t even state the oz so it&#x27;s a surprise when it arrives.  i&#x27;ll keep looking for a five star &amp; review some other glowing stuff too.</li>
    <li> It says GLOW IN THE DARK, but it really only glows in BLACKLIGHT.  Still had fun with it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful glow. It looks stunning even when you&#x27;re not under the black light. The colors are vibrant and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> This was bought for a black light party.  We splattered this paint all over our bodies.  It was very easy to use for what we intended.  We glowed beautifully and were this hit of the night!  After we were done, it washed off easily with soap and water!  I would recommend this for anyone wnating to glow in black light!  I will use this over and over!</li>
    <li> Had alot of fun with these paints with black light</li>
    <li> Worked great, lasted the entire time and washes off easily</li>
    <li> Best. Purchase. Ever.  Am I the only one who thinks a perfect end to a date is strobe lights, black lights and body paints? Definitely not alone!</li>
