      <li>I&#x27;m on my third jar now and still thing it&#x27;s great.</li>

      <li>I am REALLY hoping they make a cleanser soon too:)</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product is like a love pat to my skin.  </li>

      <li>This product makes my dry skin so nice and soft.</li>
      <li>My daughters also use the Sovaj skin care cream and really like it as well.</li>

      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Many other products we&#x27;ve tried are over $100 per jar.</li>
      <li>i  use it at night on my face and neck and in the morning my skin is soft and smooth and no dry patches.</li>
      <li>It goes on like butter and absorbs more easier than others...not sticky or heavy.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin that is easily dried out by other products (even ones claiming to be good for skin like mine).</li>
      <li>When I ran out of my first jar of Sovaj, I went back to the drugstore product I had used before.</li>
      <li>I am 49 years old</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, blotchy skin and this cream doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
      <li>Everyone is amazed when I tell them how old I am because I don&#x27;t look it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to have younger looking skin.</li>
      <li>Sovaj is less than half the price and provides slightly more cream in each jar.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and silky, and overall looks brighter and toned.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll never go back to your old cream.</li>
      <li>I tired so many different product and nothing compares to this.</li>

<li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy when applied AND is about half the price of the Eminence product I was using.</li>
<li> it just takes a little bit.</li>
<li> For me it&#x27;s a little oily for day time</li>
<li> It is not diluted by unnecessary ingredients, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I have used it for sometime and have found nothing at all negative to say about it.  </li>
<li> Now my friends are all using Sovaj--and I can keep up my active lifestyle without being afraid my face will suffer.</li>
<li> It works well as a base prior to a less expensive night cream.</li>
<li> The lines around my eyes have decreased.</li>
<li> Too bad we no longer carry it there.</li>

    <li> This cream is amazing!  After only a few days I noticed the difference in the skin on my neck.  It has a wonderful fragrance- it smells &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34;- no overpowering scent.  I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to have younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Light, silky, a nice light fragrance and a great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is really an amazing product.  My skin looks and feels so much better after using it.  I also use it on my neck and hands.  I love the feel of it and can&#x27;t wait for more Sovaj products.</li>

    <li> This product is amazing! I have used it for about 2 months now and my skin so so soft and looks much better. i  use it at night on my face and neck and in the morning my skin is soft and smooth and no dry patches. I am so happy to have found this great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yvonne</li>

Don&#x27;t get suckered in at those makeup counters!  Thanks, Doug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DeeAnn</li>
    <li> Without a doubt, the best face cream I have EVER used.  It absorbs without a greasy feeling and has no perfume smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 weeks.  It&#x27;s light and creamy and smells fantastic.  Not only does it make my skin look and feel amazing, it is about a third of the price of the cream I&#x27;ve been using for the past year.</li>
    <li> Sovaj is a great product.  It is not diluted by unnecessary ingredients, so a little goes a long way.  My first jar lasted me about 6 months.  I love the way my skin feels after use.  After using it for about a month, one of my acquaintances told my husband, &amp;#34;You&#x27;re wife has perfect skin!&amp;#34; - so I guess that is a pretty good testimony.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with the results of using this Sovaj age defying moisturizing face cream .  It feels so good when applying to my skin.  It is refreshing and soothing at the same time.  I have used it for sometime and have found nothing at all negative to say about it.  I have very sensitive skin and this product is like a love pat to my skin.  I use it twice a day morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;Morning before make up and evening before bed time. The texture is lovely and the moisturizing effect lasts all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream and am so happy to have found it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sticky due the grapefruit ingredient. It works well as a base prior to a less expensive night cream. The Sovaj opens the pores so if you use too much you may breakout...it just takes a little bit.</li>
    <li> As an avid swimmer and wakeboarder, the sun takes a toll on my skin. I have been searching for a skin care product that can protect and rejuvinate my skin. Dissatisfied with other skin care products that over promise and cost a small fortune finally I found Sovaj skin care. Now my skin tones are evened out, and there is a smooth sheen to my face, making it more youthful. And, it is affordable. Now my friends are all using Sovaj--and I can keep up my active lifestyle without being afraid my face will suffer.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! They were selling it in the shop I was working at and I tried a sample and I love it so much and decided to buy it. Too bad we no longer carry it there. But it&#x27;s ok buying it off amazon is just fine with me.  This product makes my dry skin so nice and soft. I always had dry patches on my face but not anymore! I tired so many different product and nothing compares to this. I&#x27;m on my third jar now and still thing it&#x27;s great. I only use it at night. For me it&#x27;s a little oily for day time use I didn&#x27;t like how it made my makeup look. But my mom and sis who I also turn in to a sovaj lover thing it&#x27;s fine under makeup. But yeah I think you should give it a try. You&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> As a former user of one of those&amp;#34;other&amp;#34; anti wrinkle creams, I was skeptical when I first tried Sovaj. It only took a week and I was amazed and loved Sovaj. I love how smooth and fresh it makes my face feel. Everyone is amazed when I tell them how old I am because I don&#x27;t look it. Try it once and you&#x27;ll never go back to your old cream.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best skin cream I&#x27;ve ever used! I love how soft my skin feels in the morning. When I ran out of my first jar of Sovaj, I went back to the drugstore product I had used before. There was simply no comparison so now I buy multiple jars of Sovaj  at one time because I can&#x27;t afford to run out. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and only wish Sovaj had been around 20 years ago!</li>
    <li> I am 49 years old and I have been using Sovaj about seven months. I have had fantastic results. The lines around my eyes have decreased. My daughters also use the Sovaj skin care cream and really like it as well. Many other products we&#x27;ve tried are over $100 per jar. Sovaj is less than half the price and provides slightly more cream in each jar. I like the scent. It does not leave my face with an oily feel. It&#x27;s certainly worth trying and once you try it, I&#x27;m sure you will like it.</li>
    <li> Absolutley the best face care I have ever used! Don&#x27;t have to take  tons of stuff when I travel and so easy to use. One step is all it takes.&lt;br /&gt;Julie Ritter</li>
    <li> Been using this product about 5 months on my face and my neck, in the morning and before bed.  I like it a lot as evidenced by I am buying it again. I agree with the other 5 star reviews on this product and wish they would come out with both a body cream and a hand cream. In particular, it is better than both drug store and department store creams costing much more. I splurge and use it on the back of my hands at night just before bed with good results.</li>
