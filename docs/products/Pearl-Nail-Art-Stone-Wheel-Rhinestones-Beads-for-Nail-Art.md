<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these so much perfect size and really cute</li>
    <li> these bows are very tiny! i like that though because i have soooo many that are big! these work well when doing nail art with children or anyone with really small fingers.</li>
    <li> Bows are cute but a little tinier then I expected. They still stick to the nail great.</li>
    <li> Pretty upset that I had to wait over a month for this and for there to be basically no bows in it. I&#x27;ll be using what I have, but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be ordering again unless I&#x27;m garenteed a fuller purchase.</li>
    <li> Although  they require a lot of glue to hold them in place, they are very cute!</li>
    <li> These are adorable. They accentuate the nail without over doing it like some bows (although cute to big for nails) do. I really love them.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these! I bought them because as much as I like the larger ones, my hair is constantly getting wrapped around them. These lie flat and are much more functional for me!</li>
    <li> when you put it on, its really cute! but when you add a top coat to seal in your design, it smears the color right off the bow! and some of the colors on the bow werent even on the picture</li>
    <li> Too big to really use on your nails and it was hard to keep them on</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected and the price was great thank you</li>
    <li> Cute,  but the package only had a few of each color. One color only had THREE in it! Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Not NEARLY enough of each color.</li>
    <li> I love the assortment of colors, But they are really tiny, so you might need a tool to pick them up.</li>
    <li> This bows are so cute I love them</li>
    <li> they are good for little hands I do use them much as the bigger ones</li>
    <li> They are small but nice</li>
    <li> Add a bit of nail glue to adhere to nail and it looks so cute. Was shipped on time. This was the only product I received from this company that I would reorder.</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughters nails, and we haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they look really cute. I like that they come in the convenient little wheel too!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty product but it fades after you apply the nail polish. Would have been great if the colors didn&#x27;t fade.</li>
    <li> These are really cute, but really small. I mean REALLY small, which I like. I was expecting them to be a tiny bit bigger, but I&#x27;ll have fun using them just the same and maybe they&#x27;ll stay on better since they are tiny. Worth the purchase</li>
    <li> these bows are exactly what I wanted. they fit perfectly on my nails and they are so cute! definitely will re-order</li>
    <li> I like them (: i expected something bigger, but the size of these bows are smaller than a mechanical pencil&#x27;s eraser.. Theres a lot of each color though!</li>
    <li> I got two wheels! And an extra surprise! Happy with my purchase!! The bows are just the right size for nails.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Shipped earlier than expected &amp; comes in a neat wheel carry case.  I haven&#x27;t used these bows yet, but they are the perfect size for manicures!</li>
    <li> Also cute but to tiny🐱</li>
    <li> Very small but cute; great for nail art especially if you don&#x27;t like big obnoxious things stuck to your nails. Then these are dainty and perfect. Would repurchase these, plus the colors are pretty.</li>
    <li> Super cute. They are exactly how they are described.  Only problem is that they are a little bigger than I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> Good product nice little bows happy it got here fast and I&#x27;m enjoying it, I picked the right choice and it. Looks good with my design</li>
    <li> I just recieved this after waiting FOREVER for such a small package. It looks nothing like the picture,there are only 3-5 in the little slots of the not pictured colors they show, and they are not 3.25 cm, the are so small you can barely see them, I am so angry right now!! I read reviews that it was a good thing to buy, come to find out, it was not! I want what is pictured, not this little tiny wheel with barely anything in it. Also, I am contacting them RIGHT NOW, I want my money back, or the REAL THING! HORRIBLE!</li>
    <li> So pretty. Exactly what I wanted.  They are very small, but they are for nails after all. I did get unequal amounts of the different colors.</li>
    <li> Received them today. Great size for nail art. Can&#x27;t wait to use them on my nails to see how they work.</li>
    <li> These make for some REALLY cute nail art!! Just apply a little dab of clear polish, place the bow on it, coat with clear polish and you&#x27;re done :) I will definitely order some more of these.</li>
    <li> I placed my order a month ago.  It finally arrived today.  I ordered bows and got roses.  They&#x27;re cute but not what I ordered.  There was no tracking information.  Also no invoice in the package.  I&#x27;ll probably use them to decorate picture frames or something rather than for my nails..</li>
    <li> These bows are so cute and came quick considering where they ship from. Very happy with them and cant wait to use them for tons of manis. They can even be used for decorating cards or other things.</li>
    <li> Cute for little nails</li>
    <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much for one dollar but I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot and these are actually great little bows! I didn&#x27;t get bow fragments like a couple of other people did, in fact I think I got the pieces of bow that you guys are missing because there was a little extra plastic that I had to trim on mine, sorry! The colors I got were slightly different in tone than the ones pictured but computer lighting will due that. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> They are great they are early they look just like the picture if not better super shiny way better than what I expected super easy to use as long as you have tweeters thank you so much</li>
    <li> They look so tacky! the only one I have used is the black one, because all the other colors are just flashy and tacky. I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money</li>
    <li> Was pleased with order,</li>
    <li> Very cute. Really tiny. And awesomely colored. Lol. I am very pleased with the pearl bows I just wish they were a little bigger.</li>
    <li> They r cute but look cheap and also they come less than 6bows on each color.... I have 10 finger not 6!!! Dont buy it or u will regret it!!!! Im so pissed for this crap and i put one star cuz the system dont let me rate it without stars</li>
    <li> This package arrived well before it&#x27;s due time so I was really happy about that. Note, you will get what you pay for, for this product. You do not get what is pictured. In mine, I received 5 of each colored bow. All in all I&#x27;m really happy about my purchase, just wish there were more bows.</li>
    <li> This product meet my expectations, my 11 years old daugther love the bows, and i loved too.i liked the colors ...sooo cute!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I could review the bows, since thats what I ordered and wanted. Instead I was sent a bunch of little plastic mustaches. I wanted my nails to be kawaii, not hipster! I&#x27;m not even sure if its worth the hassle of trying to contact them and return it. Just thought I would warn people that this happened to me and could possibly happen to you.</li>
    <li> The bows have a beautiful color and are the perfect size for if you work with your hands during the day. They are not too big but are big enough that you can see them. They arrived ten days earlier than expected so that is a major plus. I will definitely be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> They arrived early which was great, and though they are a lot smaller than I thought, I am glad because I have smaller nails... the downside is that it didn&#x27;t contain a consistent  amount of bows....on average I only got between 6-8 of each color...but I did get every color shown in the picture on the Web page...I guess I am happy overall.</li>
    <li> I really like this studs they r really pretty. Which can be used in many things not only with nails</li>
    <li> These are so cute and just the perfect size. If your going to order any definitely order a couple, you only get between 4 and 5 of each color! Besides that they are awesome!</li>
    <li> These bows are the perfect size for nail art. They look cute. Only problem I&#x27;ve had is I tried putting them on a customer&#x27;s acrylic nail with nail glue and they melted underneath the uv light. So it could&#x27;ve been the glue that melted it or the uv light. So if you are going to use them i probably would recommend not to do either.</li>
    <li> This purchase was a complete disappointment. These bows were the wrong colors (they are all pastels) and the quality and quantity are both terrible. Even for .70 cents, it&#x27;s a no-buy.</li>
    <li> They were much smaller than it appeared on the site.  I thought they would at least be seeable from a distant.</li>
    <li> Super cute! They are exactly what I ordered and they came ahead of delivery time. The only thing is my wheel came light blue bows instead of black. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with my order and I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Cute lil bows! I&#x27;m very happy and so I love with these cute little bows for my nails.  I love the colors, I got them just in time for spring.</li>
    <li> Theses are so cute. I&#x27;ll use them on my handmade cards. Little bows on shoes, balloons, kites, etc. They will be cute as hairbows too.</li>
    <li> These are pretty but very tiny need to put more than one on the nail for them to stand out.</li>
    <li> I was waiting for them.. but they are really cheap looking and some don&#x27;t even make a bow figure! !! :/</li>
    <li> Bought for grand-daughter&#x27;s.  Works well when they&#x27;re learning to do their own nails.  Very cute little stones!</li>
    <li> The bows are really cute, but  there are only a few bows in each colour, not like in the picture at all. I ordered 10 of these and all are the same, you can literally count the bows. Looks nothing like the picture. Other than that the packaging was good, none was broken.</li>
    <li> They are really cute bows, but they are small. I like all the different colors. I like that they are organized by color.</li>
    <li> Not what I had expected but they are nice bows and very little. It has all kinds of different colors and great quality.</li>
    <li> The bows were a lil smaller than expected but I still have used them and they are fine. Overall it was a good purchase</li>
    <li> Bows are cute but a little small. Great for young girls. I like how each color is seperated it makes it easier to use</li>
    <li> I love this, because my finger are like nubs and my fingernails are thin, and these are the only lil bows designs that can make my fingersnails look cute.</li>
    <li> Good. Nice. Okay. Alright. As expected. In one piece. Nifty. Shiny. A-ok. Acceptable. Satisfactory. Valuable. Favorable. Neat. Pleasant. Agreeable. Commendable.</li>
    <li> These are small enough so they fit perfect on nails. A lot of nice colors are included. Would recommend these</li>
    <li> These came as pictured. They look very cute on and are small. I&#x27;m pleased with purchase. I would order again.</li>
    <li> I have ordered 3 of these. I love them so much. They stay on and work very well. The colors show up very well. I love these. I was very satisfied with the order and the delivery. Thank you</li>
    <li> These bows are the best things I&#x27;ve found for my nails.  They are small but big enough to see what they are.  Flat and they don&#x27;t snag on things.  Colors are bright and pretty.  I DO NOT use nail glue to attach.  I place on a sticky top coat let dry and cover with another top coat and they stay on till I remove them a week or more later.  Best nail art I&#x27;ve found, wish they had more then just bows of this size!</li>
    <li> I got these in the mAil after a fairly long time of waiting, but that was ok, considering they were a great price. When they got here in the mail I was disappointed to find that each container ..</li>
    <li> Nice selection, get creative</li>
    <li> These are the cutest little bows. I thought they would be bigger. I do my 5 year old daughters nails all the time with these. She loves them. And I love the variety of colors.</li>
    <li> These are perfect. They arrived early and they look beautiful. Can&#x27;t wait to put them on my nails.</li>
    <li> They were smaller than I thought they would be its hard to even see the shape of the bow.</li>
    <li> THERE OK I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER BUT THERE FINE I LIKE THE COLORS AND I LIKE HOW I CAN PICK A DIFFERENT COLOR</li>
    <li> I am disapointed there are hardly any stones in each color of the wheel I just receved unopened and there are only four or five bow stones in each color :(</li>
    <li> Pretty pearly bows. They are small and flat backed and not curved to nails .None of the 12 compartments were full.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these!!  They&#x27;re just little rhinestones shaped like bows.  I&#x27;m really into bows on my nails lately, and these are PERFECT bows for when I don&#x27;t really feel like having big 3-d bows on my nails.</li>
    <li> Very Good!!! We like very much...We will order some more in next time...It is nice and beautiful....Recommend to buy some more in the future....</li>
    <li> Great purchase! I just got my package today and it&#x27;s just the size I need for my nails also very cute. Some of the colors weren&#x27;t the same as in the picture though but it&#x27;s still a good price for this item. Again very cute! c:</li>
    <li> These are small, &amp; easy to apply. I used my clear topcoat polish instead of glue, &amp; finished it with a topcoat overlayed over the whole nail (bow included) &amp; it stayed put til I purposely removed it to re-do my mani (about 5 days). Comes off with any nail polish remover (acetone or non).</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THESE FOR STOCKING STUFFERS FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER.  LOOKS TO ME LIKE YOU COULD HAVE A LOT OF FUN. GREAT PRICE.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s only 5 of each color and some only have 4. I expected more since the picture clearly shows a good amount.</li>
    <li> Very small but cute, will buy again</li>
    <li> There great I like them smaller ones they don&#x27;t come off if u put them on with a glue! Then clear coat over!</li>
    <li> They are cute but come like 5 bows per color for each slide</li>
    <li> They were perfect size for my nails.</li>
    <li> I love these bows for nail art! They are really cute and the perfect size for nails. I have seen other bows that are huge and don&#x27;t look good but these are tiny and perfect!</li>
    <li> The bows came in a variety of colors as advertised and the size is perfect as a center piece for nail art. There&#x27;s about 10-ish bow of each color, so it&#x27;s not a bad buy for the economy of scales.</li>
    <li> These were almost TOO cheap for me to use... Many of the beads and jewels were chipped or missing the backing.</li>
    <li> Nice. Some little bows were broken but that&#x27;s expected when you buy so cheap and from another country. There was a good amount of each but would have liked a little more black. Still really nice and fun</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected, but for the price, its a great value. They are plastic, so u cant bend it to the curve of the nail. But they have a nice shimmer to them and I am happy with the purchase :)</li>
    <li> I really like these but they are smaller than they look in the picture. These are very cute nail decorations though.</li>
    <li> they work really they seem expect  the seem to dry on a fast or I may  a little slow at good and may trying to make it  justto try and make it perfect</li>
    <li> I bought these last year and they were great. So when I saw them for $1 I jumped on it and bought ten. Sadly I bought them from Starfish Express and was VERY disappointed! There were only 3-5 of every color and the colors were very different from what is pictured. AND there are no black bows!</li>
    <li> Best bow size...especially on little girls. And it&#x27;s so bolkie.</li>
    <li> i likeit for the price. it is an okay product, but dont buy if you wan something that is very sturdy</li>
    <li> I received mine yesterday and it wasn&#x27;t what it said. The color of the bows a different from what&#x27;s pictured and there aren&#x27;t near as many as what it said and some of them are even chipped. They said there would be 120 bows and in mine there were only 60 (12 different colored bows and only 5 of each color)! So I&#x27;m missing half the bows! Such a disappointment!</li>
    <li> They are a little too small but are cute</li>
    <li> Just what I expected!</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was hoping for, plus it came a week early ^^</li>
    <li> These work well. They catch the light and they look extremely pretty.</li>
    <li> The bows were very transparent in color and small. Not ideal for nail art, would not recommend! I wont use them.</li>
    <li> I love these bows they are perfect!! great size for acrylic nails and all my clients love them!! they are pretty colors also</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re super cute and exactly as described.  You get about 5 of each color and they&#x27;re small enough that it doesn&#x27;t look ridiculous on your nail.</li>
    <li> Cute but the bows are very tiny.</li>
    <li> Delivery was way before I expected them to come in, took about 2wks! They are perfect for small nails &amp; just right for adult nails. I would recommend to all my nail divas to make the purchase.It&#x27;s def worth it!! U have to use nail glue or crazy glue to make it stay on.</li>
    <li> Very small bows, also not as shiny as i thought they would be</li>
    <li> I love these bows. I am going to order again. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Adorable!! Perfect amount of shine and a great shape!! Absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> I got these in the mail about a week ago and took them to my nail salon. I had my nail tech place one on each ring finger with my gel manicure and a little more detail. SO cute. I love the smaller size because they sit a little more flush then bigger ones. I did get them in many colors including black, which I really wanted.</li>
    <li> very cute, nice price, fast ship. good way to be fun with your nail art. Add these to your collection! there are a lot of pieces and long lasting!</li>
    <li> JUST SO PERFECT FOR NAIL ART FITS EVEN SMALL NAILS. WILL ORDER MORE. THEY HAVE A PEARL LOOK TO THEM. WOULD LOVE MORE IN DIFF/COLORS AND NO PEARL.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give these bows a five star because I didn&#x27;t think they were as pretty, and the quantity is very minimal &#x3D;$</li>
    <li> Small and cute.  Doesn&#x27;t take up the whole nail.</li>
    <li> The only reason that I don&#x27;t give this seller 5 stars its because it took forever for the order to arrive, I just got it on the last day that it was supposed to arrive but the bows are really cute beautiful colors as they shown even I got some dark purple ones I cannot wait to use them on my nail art.</li>
    <li> These are cute. I&#x27;m a nail tech and I use these for my little girl clients. They love feeling glamorous!</li>
    <li> They not stay in place well easy to caught on stuff</li>
    <li> These tiny bows for the nails are so cure and the perfect size to use on those small hard nails to decorate.  These are great I would recommend these to all my co-workers.</li>
    <li> These are prefect for dainty nail art manicures, they are really tiny, nut thats the beauty of them. They wont look chunky and heavy. I really do love them</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. They are TINY, which is what I wanted! Came before the due date too :)</li>
    <li> Nice size.  Love the different colors.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite, they&#x27;re small and pretty flat so they don&#x27;t get in the way but are still adorable. Any other bows I&#x27;ve purchased from here are big and bulky and end up breaking off. I used up my first order so I bought another. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Took a while to arrive. It ships from china. But they are cute  colors are a bit different then pictured. I got the following colors; light purple. Black. Orange. Mint green. Light pink. Yellow. Red. Mid tone pink. Fushia. White. Peach.  And blue  No gold like picture but they are still cute and will work for nail art.</li>
    <li> It took a long time to arrive which i thought was unneccesary since like 99% of products in the USA are made in china. I ordered these at the same time as neon circles and diamonds which also came from china. I was disapointed to find out that there is literally only 4-5 of each color in this set, they are cute but the other jewel set i got was a lot more full and i paid almost the same price, they are also a bit thick so it&#x27;s easy to bump ur hand and have them pop off, if they were a bit thinner it would really help</li>
    <li> This item is extremely small even for my small nails 😞 you can still incorporate them in nail art but glue melts it so it a poor quality so does UV/LED lamps 😞 So just use clear polish ir top coat to keep it I the nail . For the price it&#x27;s not much of a loss but I would suggest you buy elsewhere . I didn&#x27;t count them all but the quantity is almost none 3-4in each slot . I did get black Bows. I gave it 2 star just because it was packaged well and can REAlly quick 👍 now they just need to work on quality and quantity</li>
    <li> Wish it was bigger and wish that there were more!!!</li>
    <li> I loved the bows for my nail...I thought they would be a little bigger to use for my toes...I loved the colors though.</li>
    <li> Very cute! These are smaller than expected, but that is a good thing since my nails are so small. There aren&#x27;t as many in the container as it shows on the picture. That would be my only complaint.</li>
    <li> 😋 I think they look okay but you really don&#x27;t get enough. I think I got between three and five of each color.</li>
    <li> These are so adorable! Will definitely nut again.</li>
    <li> They are pastel colors &amp; theres no black.. size is good for kids hands</li>
    <li> i like it but is way too small and some had 6 - 8 bow i didn&#x27;t like that, it came on time.</li>
    <li> They are so cute and small. Love the different colors. As a nail tech there are no limits to the many different design creations you can come up with!!!!</li>
    <li> really small parts just for the nails. cute</li>
    <li> Doesnt come with as many as seen in the picture...maybe like 5 of each color...and NO BLACK. colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant either...and took really long to get here..more than two weeks...packaged really well though..</li>
    <li> These bows are perfect for little children.  Great price too.  I found items similar to this at retail stores and they sold for $9.99 so these bows are a great value!  I will buy more from these guys for sure!</li>
    <li> I believed the bows would be pliable but they aren&#x27;t. I also expected them to look different but I&#x27;m pleased. ..I guess</li>
    <li> Not that great..not many bows</li>
    <li> My 13 your old daughter love them!</li>
    <li> I got these before the deliver date which I was very happy about. They are pretty small but they would defiantly look nice on any solid paint color.</li>
    <li> Not worth it I didn&#x27;t like them! There&#x27;s only 5 bows per slot. I did receive them on time. I&#x27;m really disappointed..</li>
    <li> Very Cute,I Like all the colors, good price&lt;br /&gt;Much more smaller than i thought they would be but I&#x27;ll purchase em again.</li>
    <li> The shipping was much quicker than I expected. I was very pleased with the amount of bows that were given even though they are much smaller than I expected. Which was mentioned many times in the comments, but is still a very good product.</li>
    <li> This is nice haven&#x27;t use really yet waiting to come up with the perfect design to use with them! Cute on little girls nails</li>
    <li> dos&#x27;nt bring all the colors as shown on image and only brings 5 bows per color</li>
    <li> bows were WAY smaller than i expected but that&#x27;s okay!! what i&#x27;m not happy with is that i only got 3 or less of a certain color of bows. good product otherwise, cute colors. fast shipping.</li>
    <li> They are smaller then my expection but they fit nice on my little nails there so cute! Great for althletic kids</li>
    <li> These bows are nice, and small (about 3.5 mm wide) but there was only one color that had enough to do an entire set of nails. I would recommend buying two wheels so you can be sure you can do an entire set of one color. Most are only 6 or 7 bows per color. There were no black bows in my wheel which was the reason I really wanted to get this. That was disappointing as well.</li>
    <li> Definitely a great product and worth the price since you can buy the same thing at Sally&#x27;s for $8. Very cute.</li>
    <li> Received a different product instead of getting bows I got mustaches. I end up giving that away since wasn&#x27;t the product I ordered.</li>
    <li> Definitely not what I was expecting . the picture makes them look so much bigger. There tiny tiny even the packaging they come in is super small</li>
    <li> These bows were tinier than I had expected (the whole wheel thingy is smaller than my palm) however, I don&#x27;t have long nails so they are perfect. There are enough colors to match any nail polish color. I am really pleased with this product and can&#x27;t wait to start using it. Also, these came in a little under two weeks before the first date stated for arrival, which was a surprise, seeing that they come from China. Overall, very pleased with product and shipping time. Definitely recommend this product (if you don&#x27;t want big bows [they&#x27;re not bigger than a pencil eraser head]) and also recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Love how it was made and how it arrived. It was very speedy. the packaging was great and the product was good too!</li>
    <li> Good color selection. Stayed on my nails for a long time with nail glue. Good price shipped quickly. Overall I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I though there were gonna be abit larger but they are supper cute good zises too</li>
    <li> I love the wide selection of colors. I prefer smaller nail art decorations because I feel like they won&#x27;t fall off as easily.  The size is perfect for multiple applications.</li>
    <li> Came early so it&#x27;s always a plus. It&#x27;s pretty small but they&#x27;re cute it&#x27;s not bad for $2</li>
    <li> I love bows! These are super cute. The only problem: The color bleeds out of them really easily. Poo.</li>
    <li> So affordable. And cute for my nail designs. I just adore nail decorations.I will buy again.These bows are better for small child or if you don&#x27;t like the big bows catching on things.</li>
    <li> I do my nails myself every week. These bows were not in the way on my nails. They come in a great selection of colors.</li>
    <li> there are only 15 bows</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the variety of colors and size. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I got about 8 bows of each color.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift great price</li>
    <li> They are way smaller then I thought they would be but they are still cute.</li>
    <li> Love THEM!!!  Purfect size, color, and price.</li>
    <li> Its so bad things not like the picture ,also they are not so small I advised you do not buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no credibility !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are teeny tiny and super cute for nails! They take a long time to recieve because they come from out of the country but that is to be expected. Some were broken in half but it came with a lot of bows so it&#x27;s fine. Very cute.</li>
    <li> for whatever reason, I thought the bows were going to be bigger than what they were. Either way, they look great, the colors are pretty, and I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Good product, great price and nice service.</li>
    <li> Thank you! these are perfect</li>
    <li> They were very cute and very small&lt;br /&gt;But not many came in each container</li>
    <li> Would have gave no stars got diamonds instead of bows ! Was speedy shipping but......</li>
    <li> they are really cute &amp;#60;3 and i can&#x27;t wait to use them! they do come in different colors and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;the only reason why i gave it a 4/5 rating is because I have not used them yet to see how well they will stay on the nails... but i will update soon ^^</li>
    <li> they were exactly as described and they adhere well to the nail great product and I plan to purchase more.</li>
    <li> There cute but a little bigger than I expected</li>
    <li> These bows are absolutely adorable! i got them as a present for a friend and she loves them. They are cheap and are great!</li>
    <li> Tiny little pearl bows of all colours that come with a case. Just the right size to put one or maybe two on a nail.</li>
    <li> I have very tiny nail beds, baby hands I call them. So many nail decals especially plastic ones are much too wide for my nail. These are super tiny and they are metallic sort of in color. I like the different shades they come in. And my favorite bow-type shape. They took awhile to come but that&#x27;s expected since they are coming from China. My only issue is that I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s an issue with their machine that makes these because there&#x27;s 1 or 2 bow-pieces in every slot that did not form into full bows, just half. So there&#x27;s like... bow crumbs included. Probably too much effort to pick them out but I feel like I could have been getting 3-5 more whole bows in the whole tray had they not had crumbs, assuming these are fed into the slow by weight. Even if not... I&#x27;m not terribly mad about it. I&#x27;m just glad theses were small enough. This is my third time ordering trying to find decals tiny enough and I won this time.</li>
