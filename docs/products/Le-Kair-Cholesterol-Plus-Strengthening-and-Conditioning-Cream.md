<li> Without it, my hair is so dry it literally becomes crunchy and constantly has split ends.  </li>
<li> and my hair was straw-like and over-processed and &#x27;old&#x27; looking with no life, no shine, much less volume than ever before</li>
<li> however the current formula has mineral oil which can be problematic for some people who are prone to breakouts so be careful to keep it off your face until the final rinse.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it but too pricey. It&#x27;s like 2 dollars in the gangster area :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m growing my hair longer (I&#x27;m dominican, with relaxed hair) and saw this product in a website, they recommended it for any type of black hair. So fair it&#x27;s great: no tangles (thus no breakage!) and great shine...and important: it&#x27;s huge and very cheap.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> When I get my hair done (rollers and blow dryer) my hair last longer, I sweat and my edges/hairline hair is stays down.</li>
    <li> i bought mine from walmart for under two $ i bleach my hair and its very thick and i am white female. i did as directions shampoo massage conditioner into hair leave for two minuts then repeat conditioner. love it my hair is soft and feels good. i will probley use this 3 or 4 times a month beacuse in the past i used deep condioners too often and it left a build up on my scalp. the smell of this is fine too.</li>
    <li> The reviews for this product were all amazing, and I was very excited to try it out; my over processed really needed help. The first few times I used it, I did not notice any results, so the next few times I used it I put a lot of the product on and it make my hair feel good, but not great. I have to use a lot of the product to see results. It&#x27;s not very expensive but I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle worker. My husband has painful Psoriasis of the scalp. He had tried everything ans seen many specialists, nothing worked. My best friend suggested he try this very inexpensive product. We were sure it would not work after having spent a fortune on other solutions to stop the \\&quot;scabbing\\&quot;. It cleared up his psoriasis in less than one month and it has not come back. It has been over one year now and he says the best time of his life. Unfortunately the store that carried it in our area discontinued the product. You can always count on Amazon, thank goodness. Try this if you have uncomfortable scalp, scaling, or psoriasis of the scalp.</li>
    <li> OMFG!!! This stuff is amazing!!! My hair is thick and curly, and is prone to breakage, split ends, kinks, knots, tangles, you name it! But this stuff not only detangles my hair, but leaves it so soft, smooth, and manageable!&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to apply after shampooing and leave on for 2 minutes, but I usually leave it on for about an hour covered with a shower cap. No irritation, no funky smells, or residue. Just clean, softy, silkys hair! Will definitely be stocking up on this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I have being using this stuff for years.  I use it every time I wash my hair (three times a week) in addition to a shampoo and conditioner. There is nothing better for dry, frizzy naturally curly hair.  Without it, my hair is so dry it literally becomes crunchy and constantly has split ends.  I am so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the product, and it got to me in a more than timely manner. That being said, they only thing that kinda got me was that it was packaged in a coffee box, so that threw me initially, like, &amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t order coffee&amp;#34;!! I really don&#x27;t care for coffee, lol. So I contacted the seller thinking there was a mistake, and they advised me to open the box, and there was my conditioner, lol so that turned out fine. The only other thing is that it was spilling out somewhat, but they had it wrapped in plastic, so it was still somewhat contained, so I didn&#x27;t lose any, yeah I&#x27;m petty like that, lol. At any rate, they gave awesome service, and I will order again.</li>
    <li> Smells bad. Works great</li>
    <li> This always gets my hair back to a healthy place. An inexpensive deep penetrating conditioner that stops my hair from breaking.</li>
    <li> This hair cholesterol is amazing, it helps to lock in moisture and I am seeing less breakage</li>
    <li> Just bought this at Wal-Mart last night,under $2 bucks.Super cheap!! I deep conditioned my hair today,its super soft love the feel of it.And its definitely moisturzied,best $2 bucks I spent in a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been trying everything under the sun to get my hair to grow and keep moisture - coconut oil, jojoba, castor oil, Jamaican black castor oil, olive oil, eggs, coconut conditioners, keratin repair products, etc. etc.  And nothing seemed to work.  In fact, my hair had gotten worse since March-dry, wiry, strawy, continuous breakage and shedding - just horrible.  I didn&#x27;t feel like I had hair on my head, but a brillo pad. I&#x27;ve been using this product at least once per week for the last three weeks and it has done wonders for my hair.  It is now soft and feels like hair again.  Tried to find some at the local Walmart for $1.87 and they were out of stock.  I can see why.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it and give an update in about six months.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This works great on my natural afro textured hair...it is much softer than when i was using a different conditioner. and its mad cheap too! i find it in the stores for 1.93 but the amazon price isnt too bad either!</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair. When the new growth comes in things get messy and breaky. I dont like to over process my hair so I procrastinate on the perm for as long as possible. I use this following a shampoo. It just makes my tangles vanish leading to less breakage.&lt;br /&gt;And its so cheap. You get this from a local Wal-Mart or beauty supply for around $2.</li>
    <li> Great for repair hair needed</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a Hair &amp; Beauty store on a whim and didn&#x27;t use it for about a month.  Pulled it out and used it last week and OMG, it transformed my relaxed hair!  I usually am in need of a &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; every 4 weeks.  I&#x27;ve been trying to stretch it out now and this truly has helped.  It softens my new growth!  I used it again yesterday and I have even MORE new growth, but it soften my hair, made it managable and it&#x27;s so easy to comb through.  Leaves my hair soft and silky with lot&#x27;s of body and bounce!  I willl defintaely keeping this as a part of  my hair regimen.</li>
    <li> Well I usually don&#x27;t like buying cheap hair products for my hair but I kept seeing this in walmart everytime I went to the hair section so I picked it up and smelled it then put it down. I saw the price at $1.87 and thought hmmm must not be good for my thick hair (I&#x27;m going natural currently 2 months post so I need good deep conditioners for my new growth) so I FINALLY bought it about a couple weeks ago and I left it on for a half hour with a shower cap like I do all my conditioners..its so thick and I used tooooo much of it but it was okay its a lot in the jar so I just slabbed it on and when I rinsed it out OMG my hair was like heaven little to no breakage and my hair is shiny and so soft I love this product so much I bought one for my mom because I don&#x27;t want her using mine up lol but I would recommend this conditioner</li>
    <li> This brand is the best choice if you care about both your hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff I have been using it on my hair for years and it keeps my hair from breaking and continue to grow.  This is the best brand because it doesn&#x27;t have lanolin in it like queen helene&#x27;s.  If I use queen helene&#x27;s I end up with micro-bumps all around my forehead and hairline.  So if you want the moisture but, want to keep clear skin... this is the best brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;African American&lt;br /&gt;Relaxed hair- (every 3 months)&lt;br /&gt;Fine hair -lots of it&lt;br /&gt;Mid length&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products I like:&lt;br /&gt;Aubrey Organics-White Camellia conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Redken Anti-snap leave-in treatment&lt;br /&gt;Pure white Camellia oil&lt;br /&gt;Apple-cider vinegar (diluted as a clarifier)</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel soft and moisturized</li>
    <li> After I wash my hair I use this product, I tend to spread it over my hair and comb it through then let it sit for about ten to twenty minutes. I have noticed it stops my hair from breaking and it helps my hair to grow. I tend to get a relaxer every two months because this product will keep my hair looking healthy between my treatments, a must buy!!</li>
    <li> Perfect conditioner for all hair. Puts the finishing shine on your hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I was in college.  I have been coloring my dark brown/ black hair pretty much forever.  I am Korean with medium texture hair, prone to frizzies.  I also don&#x27;t have a lot of hair if think about the diameter of a ponytail.  I have always had great hair with great volume however.  The reason why I hope that you will try this is to keep up demand...I live on the US East Coast and at one point it disappeared from shelves and I could only get Queen Latifah, WHICH DOES NOT WORK FOR ME.  So stopped using cholesterol.  Then I found it again at a drugstore in Montreal for just a few months and then it was taken off their shelves again...so I couldn&#x27;t get it.  I went back about 3x.  Then recently when I stopped using conditioners because I was concerned that there were comedogenic ingredients, I had been battling breakouts...and my hair was straw-like and over-processed and &#x27;old&#x27; looking with no life, no shine, much less volume than ever before and I just couldn&#x27;t believe it had come to this.  So on a trip to the US I ordered this product from here on Amazon and after 3 uses, WOW.  I mean WOW.  I have also recently tried Arbonne pure vibrance conditioner with botanicals and it&#x27;s great, I like that line a lot but every pales in comparison with this gooey gold for hair.  So what I do is wash my hair, then I put gobs of this on my whole head and scalp but concentrating on my dry and brittle ends.  I comb through with a fine toothed comb to COAT EVERY STRAND.  Be gentle!  Then I wait a long time at least 2 hours and I blow dry (medium setting - 2) with my awesome ceramic blow dryer, concentrating on the ends.l.  Then I wait some more at least an hour then I blow dry and add more cholesterol again so all the strands are coated.  The reason why I use my blow dryer is because as you know when you go to the hair dresser, heat helps products penetrate the hair shaft for long lasting results.  So after doing this a few times, I&#x27;m ecstatic to be re-united with this product which is the ELUSIVE LeKAIR.  I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re prone to breakouts however the current formula has mineral oil which can be problematic for some people who are prone to breakouts so be careful to keep it off your face until the final rinse.  The main difference that I see is really a tremendous increase in thickness, which translates to great and body and volume.  I recently changed hair color and the top 2/3 of my hair is the nicest.  The bottom is getting there.  I may try to go back to the original frizz-ease which I used for years then stopped bc I had my problems with breakouts...since it was excellent as smoothing the cuticle so hair looks shinier.  I think that it also protects...  Anyways, if you try this very affordable product you may be as delighted as I am...and the company will keep making and stocking it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It works well on thin curly full heads of hair. Other products with hydrolized proteins have straightened my natural curl and caused breakage with long-term use. I do not want straight hair! I would recommend it for dry hair. My hair was very soft and fluffy after the first use. Hopefully my hair continues to like the product. Stay tuned!</li>
    <li> Just brought this from Walmart for $1.87! Mix this with some extra virgin olive oil (My hair is extra dry and protein sensitive) and sat under my dryer for 30 mins with plastic cap. Did wonders and is the only protein treatment I will ever put on my hair. Not over powering at all! I happen to love the smell. Its thick and creamy not watered down like some cheapy products and did I mention it was $1.87. Try it, and if u don&#x27;t like it at least you didnt throw $20.00 or etc. down the drain.  P.S- Im a 23 yr old african american relaxed head. On a healthy hair journey. Wish me luck :)</li>
    <li> I have straight Caucasian hair that has damage on the ends from over bleaching. Most of the damage was cut off but the ends are still dry. I shampooed my hair then put this protect on and left if under a shower cap for 30+ minutes. Then washed out with cool water. In the shower my hair felt thicker, but also like it needed conditioner. That is normal for a protein treatment. The protein adds strength but you may need to re-add moisture afterwards. Using protein treatments too often can also lead to dry brittle hair. I then used a deep conditioner and my hair felt great. Got this at Walmart for under 2 dollars.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT ON A WHIM WHILE AT WALMART B/C I NEEDED A PROTEIN CONDITIONER TO TRY AND COMBAT MY EXCESSIVE BREAKAGE I WAS HAVING. I AM 8 MONTHS POST RELAXER AND THIS STUFF DID ME WONDERS. I SAW ALOT OF GOOD REVIEWS ON IT BEFORE I USED IT AND I THOUGHT HEY THIS COULD BE GOOD. I WAS SOOOO RIGHT. IT GAVE ME GREAT MOISTURE AND THE SHINE IS UNBELIEVEABLE! I LOVE IT!</li>
