<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love Argan oil but I found it a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this oil</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this product. This argan oil helps me keep away frizz and fly-aways when it&#x27;s humid, and has made my hair much softer. I have been using it about twice a week and have noticed a huge change. I&#x27;ve also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, or make it too oily like other argan oil products I have tried. I originally got it for my hair, but noticed that it can be used for my skin as well. I tend to have really dry skin, and it&#x27;s nice to use a product that&#x27;s 100% natural oil, with no other questionable ingredients on my skin.</li>
    <li> I started using Argan Oil awhile back, first purchasing it on QVC through a very expensive brand.  I loved the results I was getting but couldn&#x27;t afford to keep buying that brand.  I decided to try some less expensive brands on Amazon and have liked them all....but I definitely like this brand the most.  The packaging is beautiful....looks like a much more expensive product....it looks so pretty, I keep it out on my vanity.  The Argan Oil is dispensed through a dropper, which I love because it gives me much more control over how much product I use....you only need a few drops so I love that none is wasted.  The Argan Oil itself is great....absorbs quickly and leaves my face super soft.  I also use it on my cuticles.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I started using this product on my arms, legs, and face about three days ago. It has a descent, non-overpowering smell and my skin feels softer than it does when I use body lotion. It doesn&#x27;t completely set into your skin and I can still feel the oil several hours after applying it.This seems to be a good product for someone who wants really soft skin and who doesn&#x27;t mind being temporarily oily/greasy.</li>
    <li> Love it! This product instantly made my hair softer and less frizzy without weighing it down. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants shiny and healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I received it as a gift and I just had to write in a review. I use Argan Alchemy on my face and a bit in my hair. All I need are a few drops and my skin feels nourished but not oily. I&#x27;ve always used natural oils in place of moisturizers but Argan Alchemy is by far my favorite so far. It&#x27;s clean, with almost no smell to it and it absorbs into my skin and hair as though it was never there. I love the bottle and the dropper. It looks beautiful on my bathroom shelf.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with Argan Alchemy. The oil has worked wonders for my dry skin, as it works well for both soothing and moisturizing. I also find that this brand has a nicer smell compared to other argan oils I&#x27;ve tried, some of which can be a bit unpleasant. The nice packaging is really attractive and classy.</li>
    <li> I love my argan oil! It keeps the skin very moist and hair sleek. It is very non-oily, so it is nice to put on your skin without feeling all sticky. Argan Alchemy got my sample to me very quickly and I was very impressed with their product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying Argan Alchemy for some very positive results.  I have extremely dry skin and I&#x27;m quite embarrassed with my ashen white legs. I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizing lotions to help but honestly do not like how the lotion feels on my skin.  It had a very light consistency and had an almost close to no scent.  The Argan Oil nourishes the skin because it is quickly absorbed into the skin. My legs showed a much more healthier skin glow by adding 3 drops of Argan Alchemy Argan Oil to my leg. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I use this for everything now.. totally hooked! At first I was skeptical and didn&#x27;t think it was really worth the higher price. I&#x27;ve used lower grade argan oil claiming to be 100% pure and wasn&#x27;t super impressed. This smells amazing, nothing added. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face at night and my color treated hair (just the ends) and already see and feel a difference after 3 weeks. Having it on my hands has reduced chapped fingers and hang nails too. A little goes a long way so I&#x27;m guessing this bottle will last at least another 6 - 9 weeks. The dropper makes it easy to use, no spilling. This is pretty new on the market so I&#x27;m interested to hear about other people&#x27;s experience with the product.</li>
    <li> This product is totally 100% pure Argan Oil so you won&#x27;t have to worry about getting any other ingredient in there besides that. Because it is so pure, it works wonders on whatever you decide to use it for. It can be used on the face, neck, body, nails and hair. Because I have such dry hair and scalp, I decided to concentrate mostly on my hair and I am so glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp has not been as itchy as it was before I started using this product and of course, I did run it across my face a few times so that I could tell you whether or not I liked it there also. And I did. I loved that it absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a heavy oily residue. But, I really loved it on my elbows and a few other places on my body that tend to get drier and it absorbed very quickly there also. I loved feeling that silky skin!</li>
    <li> Great Argan OIl. Loved how it sunk into skin right away and that it made skin felt softer and smoother. This is a good brand of oil that I would be happy to purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve found out about natural beauty and skin care products I prefer to use them on my skin. Lots of other beauty products that you purchase in stores have so many chemicals that it really makes you wonder about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Alchemy is great for your skin and you can put it in your hair to nourish it and moisturize. If you have dry hair like I can get occasionally from over-processing this will make it nice and smooth and shiny looking again. I only use one or two drops since I have shorter hair and it works great. It makes my hair looking a lot more healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my body after bathing instead of a moisturizer. It absorbs into my skin very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling afterwards. It leaves my skin soft and smooth and more nourished.</li>
    <li> Shopping for beauty products that are organic and actually work can be a challenge.  Have you ever tried using Argan Oil for your skin or hair?  Argan Oil is beneficial as an anti-aging product, as well as a moisturizer for your skin and hair.  The oil is rich in nutrients and antioxidants, that protect the skin from free radicals.  Argan Oil can be used to cool off and calm inflammation and relieve the stymptoms of eczema, acne and psoriasis.  You could say that Argan Oil is a gift from nature, which rejuvenates the skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one bottle of Argan Oil, from Argan Alchemy to review!  The things, that I love most about the Argan Oil is that it’s not greasy, it absorbs quickly, while moisturizing your skin and hair.  It’s rich in essential fatty acids, Vitamin E, and Omega 3-6-9, which are all vital to your skin.  The oil makes your hair stronger, vibrant and lustrous.  The oil is a 100% natural and certified organic, by the USDA and Ecocert, fair-traded, and bottled in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is bottled in a blue glass bottle, which preserves its high quality by filtering out sunlight.  The Argan oil is imported from the Essaouira province of south west Morocco, where it’s grown and produced by cooperatives of local Berber women.  By purchasing this oil, you are contributing positively to their local economy, their social equality, and to the local eco-system, because more Argan trees get planted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil is one of my favorite products and I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Argan Alchemy 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil. This product was great to help improve your daily beauty routine. Plus it smells really grest! I love the fact that it is an Organic Product. I always tend to try to purchase organic over chemical filled competitors. I know that Argan Alchemy 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil will not disappoint you! This product gets a 5 star and two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion. To read the rest of my review, please visit the blog (Krazy Coupon Club)! Above is just a small portion of my thoughts.</li>
    <li> I received this argan oil to review and am MORE than pleased with it. It has worked wonders on my dry hair, and I am looking forward to using it as a moisturizer next. You can definitely tell this apart from other argan oils, I feel like it works far more efficiently than the others I&#x27;ve used. I tried it as a deep conditioner and left it in overnight, then washed it out, and my hair felt like it had all of the life back to it even though it had been bleached, and to the beach a week prior. It&#x27;s also great to use if you use a couple drops to add a nice shine to your hair without looking greasy at all! I highly highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine lent me some of this argan oil.  It was the first time I had tried it and I loved it so much I went out and bought a bottle of my own.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t choose the same brand and although the second is good - this one is much better.  It feels velvety going on but not greasy at all and it absorbs better than any other oil I&#x27;ve tried.  I use it on my face, hair and body and it works well on all of them.  It keeps my skin hydrated and supple and it even seems to eliminate any redness - which makes my complexion clearer.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this argan oil. I had been using a more expensive brand and this is equally effective at a lower price. I like the bottle and design, too. This is definitely one of the more high-quality argan oils out there. I like that it&#x27;s organic, too.</li>
    <li> Disclosure - free sample provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love products that nourish and hydrate my skin.  I have been using argan oil for some time on my skin, nails, and hair.  Have you ever used argan oil?  It is a versatile product that really works great.  I want to introduce you to Argan Alchemy.  This is pure organic argan oil.  This product can be used for so many things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of argan oil from Argan Alchemy.  I love using it to hydrate my skin.  I have found that a little bit goes a very long way to provide your skin with tons of moisture.  This product is completely natural too.  The product contains no additives, and it is made with 100% pure argan oil.  I found it to be very gentle on my skin.  Have you tried argan oil?  What do you use it for?  I personally love to use it on my hair at bedtime.  It really helps add shine, and keep it looking healthy!</li>
    <li> I’ve been trying Argan Alchemy’s argan oil this summer and have been surprised at how quickly and thoroughly it moisturizes both my hair and skin. I’ll admit – I was concerned that it might be too greasy or oily to directly moisturize with oil (sometimes that happens when I use coconut oil). And I was nervous about applying it to my dry hair … would it turn my hair incredibly greasy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surprising and great news is that it didn’t turn my skin or hair oily – it just moisturized. I’ll be happy to use a couple drops a day – I’ll enjoy the natural moisturizing and my bottle of “Liquid Gold” will last a while.</li>
    <li> As a fairly typical health/wellness product adverse guy I was skeptical at first about purchasing this product. My ongoing issues with acne and eczema led me to give it a shot in the end. After my first and second applications I immediately noticed a difference. Applied in the evening I find I look more vibrant and alive in the morning. When I begin to notice acne forming on my face (typically my nose) I apply Argan Oil and immediately notice a soothing, anti-inflammatory effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product specifically came as advertised and I was very pleased with my purchase. The quality seems  premium and I intend to make another purchase when this first batch runs out! It seems as though one bottle will last me quite some time which is great.</li>
    <li> 100% great for my skin and hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, I put it in my shampoo, conditioner, body &amp; Facial wash (all natural products with no additives). The argan oil enhances my everyday products plus, Once a day I put it directly on my skin (face). Leaves both my hair and face very soft.</li>
    <li> After years of dying my hair it has always gotten split ends or VERY dry. After using this a few times my hair has gotten back to it’s soft, silky smooth self! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product! I use on my knees and elbows, and sometimes on clean, damp hair. It works great. Packaging is lovely as well and company is very friendly and communicative. I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I am very happy and would be if I purchased this product. I will consider purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> I admit it. I have difficult hair.It is aging, thick, unruly and curly. I have tried pretty much every curly haired product that exists and I find that natural and organic products work the best. They dont weigh the curls down and argan oil does the opposite. They are springy and look so healthy and happy when applied lightly to the ends and through the rest of my dry hair. I love this bottle, design, and product. It smells light, applies on lightly and is wonderful. I highly recommend Argan Alchemy for your hair needs.</li>
    <li> The oil I received from Argan Alchemy is perfect for my hair! It is not as heavy as Moroccan Oil and works great for my fine hair.  I add two to three drops to my hand and smooth it over my hair after blow drying it. It leaves my hair silky and smooth. I then rub whatever is left on my hands in to my arms as a moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I received this for free for review purposes. I have been using this on my super brittle hair--I had dyed it red velvet cupcake for over a year and it got damaged. In just a short period of time my hair has a lot more vitality! I love that this has no extra junk in it--just straight argan oil!</li>
    <li> Argan Alchemy&#x27;s 100% organic Argan Oil is pure, cold pressed and unrefined oil. Argan Alechmey sources the Argan Oil from southwest Morocco, where the Argan trees have grown for thousands for years. The Argan Oil is certified as USDA Organic and EcoCert. The oil comes in a dark blue glass bottle, which is necessary for preserving the qualities of the oil and extending the shelf life. Argan Oil storage is important because oils are sensitive to light and must be stored in dark amber bottles to prevent oxidation. Oils that are not stored in dark bottles will oxidize, lose potency and become ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite parts about Argan Oil is that it can be used as part of just about any beauty care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally softens and moisturizes skin&lt;br /&gt;Smooths hair naturally&lt;br /&gt;Repairs dry and frizzy hair&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes and shines nails&lt;br /&gt;Helps to prevent pregnancy stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the ways that I like to use Argan Oil:&lt;br /&gt;Remove makeup on eyes and face&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize the face and body&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize nails and cuticles&lt;br /&gt;Quick conditioner for my fine hair&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil has become one of my favorite products. Winter left my hands red and dry. After the first application of Argan Oil, my hands felt silky and supple. Even coconut oil could not touch the dryness of my hands. I love that Argan Oil absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling. My skin stays moisturized and supple for several hours (until I hand wash dishes again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even been using Argan Oil to moisturize my face and my legs. The best application so far has been to moisturize my dry hands after gardening or washing dishes by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil is rated as 0 (no hazard) by the EWG Skin Deep database. I feel completely safe using it for moisturizing and other beauty applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil does have a bit of a nutty smell to it. The smell reminds me of Neem Oil, but disappears within a few minutes. I have come to like the nutty smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Argan Alchemy&#x27;s 100% organic Argan Oil. Argan Oil is the best natural beauty treatment for skin, hair and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample to facilitate my review. No other compensation was received. All opinions are my own.like the nutty smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Argan Alchemy&#x27;s 100% organic Argan Oil.

All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent service (shipped fast and intact, the bottle is carefully protected). The packaging is designed with taste, the glass bottle protects the oil from becoming rancid.&lt;br /&gt;As it is hard to find cold pressed, unrefined, organic argan oil, I did not hesitate in purchasing this product righ taway and am using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;It is excellent pure or mixed with essential oils. I add a few drops of tea tree extract and apply the mixture on my face to fight acnea. It&#x27;s also good against exema and other skin problems, as argan oil is very smooth for the skin.</li>
    <li> The Argon Alchemy oil is comparable to the other more pricey oils on the market. I have tried many including the Josie Maran and the only difference is the price. This rich nourishing oil is the perfect product for winter from hair to nails it hydrates and nourishes. The Argon Alchemy company has done a wonderful job of providing consumers with an organic high quality Argon oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unique combination of antioxidant and moisturizing properties in this oil can help to maintain skin elasticity while preventing moisture loss that can contribute to the aging process. Argon oil is high in vitamins and minerals – omega 6 fatty acids and vitamin e. A quick Google search and you can find a world of uses for this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Argon oil nightly after using a vitamin-C serum as my moisturizer it really locks in moisture and keeps my skin hydrated. I use Argon oil on my lips after exfoliation I also use it in my nightly lip mask it locks in moisture and prevents irritation and chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On dry cuticles a few drops is all you need the same goes for hair. Quick Fido fabulous tip! Argon oil is one of the best treatments for a dog with a dry nose nails and paws this quickly heals the area and nourishes those delicate areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; use this product on nails, scars, lips, face and hands it keeps my skin happy clear and beautiful at a price I can smile about.  If you have scars or stretchmarks this product is a must.  I plan on purchasing for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer- I did receive this product free in exchange for my unbiased honest review.</li>
    <li> It is gold , all pure and so smooth for both the hair and face . With winter coming it will be a perfect gift for both ypu and your family .&lt;br /&gt;It is so much cheaper than in QVC too .</li>
    <li> I know that Aragan Oil is raved about in the beauty industry.  I see it for face, hair, lotions - you name it.  I was attracted to Argan Alchemy&#x27;s product due to the packaging, the fact that I was giving back to Berber women, and the 100% satisfaction guarantee.  For me, that is a win-win-win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived fast (thank you Amazon), and I was very pleased in person with the overall look.  I am a packaging snob and loved the foil detailing.  It looked like a product I would see in the spa where I get my facials done.  Basically - quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Chicago and this winter has been horrible.  I started using the oil on my cuticles and hands.  It wasn&#x27;t a heavy oil like Olive Oil - that lingers.  It&#x27;s still oil, but light somehow.  The other night I put the argan oil on my scalp and washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do plan to update this review after I have had the product longer.  But first impressions are everything - and so far, I am happy with Argan Alchemy!</li>
    <li> I have been using argan oil now for a couple of years.  I just recently began to use the Argan Alchemy brand.  I find it to be on par with other brands that I have used in the past.  Certified organic is important of course.&lt;br /&gt;Argan Alchemy is of a high quality. It has no smell to speak of, and is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;What makes it different from the rest?  The price point is excellent.  Almost 30% less than what I was paying for another notable brand of argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;So why pay more?&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Argan Alchemy to all my argan oil loving friends.</li>
    <li> So far with only using this product twice today, my skin feels so soft. My arms are amazing. The one thing that I am so impressed about is how it does not leave residue on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;****Day Two Update****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am very pleased with this Argan oil. Last night I did do the scalp relaxing, with this product. To be honest it was very nice. I have continued to use it on my skin as well. I used it this morning and this afternoon. So far my skin is so nice and soft. I had to discontinue use on my face. The only reason I had to stop using it on my face is because my face is extremely sensitive and I have to be careful. The product still soaks into the skin rapidly and there is no residue left. I was able to put it on this morning with my perfume with no problems, when it comes to mixing the products and smells. So far and its only days two, I would recommend this product to you. It is a very nice treatment for your skin. I really have noticed great results on my legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Day Three Update****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it is now day three. The results are still amazing. I have been using this product on my body and hair as well. My skin on my legs are not as dry as what they normally are. In the summer it seems that my legs tend to dry out rather quickly. With this product they are silky smooth. I have also been using on my arms and stomach. I have had the same results with these area’s as well. The product, even though I have been using it for three days now, still is soaking into the skin nicely. I did discontinue use on my face due to my over sensitivity to some products, I wish it were not so. I can only imagine the results one would have on their face. My hair is silky smooth as well! So far excellent results, and I am starting to really get addicted to this argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Day Four Update****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we are already at day four. So far this product does everything that it states. My skin and hair are so very soft. Like I said before, I had to discontinue use on my face and I could only imagine what my face would feel like. This product has really made my legs so very soft and they don’t seem to be as dry any more. I think  that I am going to end my review today, because I feel like I am saying the same things over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would recommend this product, it is amazing! A must tryaid before, I had to discontinue use on my face and I could only imagine what my face would feel like. This product has really made my legs so very soft and they don’t seem to be as dry any more. I think  that I am going to end my review today, because I feel like I am saying the same things over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would recommend this product, it is amazing! A must try</li>
    <li> I’m a big fan of Argan oil for treating dry skin, especially on my hands. While moisturizers help, Argan oil goes beyond what moisturizers can do not only for soothing dryness, but also helping to heal cracks at my fingertips. Argan oil has worked better than anything else I’ve tried.&lt;br /&gt; The smell is almost neutral and clean! It does not leave an oily residue it absorbs quickly into the skin. Smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for just over 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;When it first arrived I was very impressed with how beautiful the bottle was and I was excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it daily on my face and about once a week on my scalp.  My hair looks shinier and my skin feels moisturized and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very high quality organic oil and I&#x27;m loving the results it&#x27;s giving me.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Helps smooth my hair and avoid frizz.</li>
    <li> It seems Argan oil is everywhere lately, added to every lotion and potion on the market. Apparently, it was an ancient secret hidden in its native region, the Essaouira province of south west Morocco until recently. The Argan tree has grown there for thousands of years, and its nuts have been utilized for their precious oil for centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between Argan Alchemy and all those other products flooding the market is that this contains no additives, fragrances or preservatives. It&#x27;s simply 100% pure organic Argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already been a fan of Argan products, so I was curious to try the pure oil. It seems to me that Argan Alchemy is aptly named. It comes in a lovely blue bottle with a dropper applicator- and it really only takes a few drops. It softened my skin to a glowing sheen and dis wonders in my hair. I tried massaging a bit in after washing and the results were shiny, touchably soft locks- better than any smoothing treatment I&#x27;ve tried. Color-treated, over-processed hair will soak this stuff up and sigh with relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I love is that they import the oil at fair trade prices from women-run cooperatives in Morocco. How cool is that?</li>
    <li> I really liked Argan Alchemy&#x27;s Pure Organic Argan Oil; unlike other brands, this Argan Oil came in a fancy glass bottle with a dropper, which I felt was a much better application tool for targeting small areas of hair or target areas on the skin. I liked that I did not have to make a mess with the oil in I order to apply it. I put it on my split ends primarily, and a little went a LONG way. If you have very thin hair that is prone to becoming greasy, make sure you use a very miniscule amount of product (this bottle will last you forever!), to avoid that &amp;#34;I haven&#x27;t showered&amp;#34; look. In my hair I can use a little more, because it is thick and resistant to becoming oily. I rub a little into my palms and do a quick swipe over the sides and back of my hair, as well as massaging a dime-sized amount into the ends. I like that Argan Alchemy doesn&#x27;t add anything to their Argan Oil -- although I would prefer to have a light fragrance, it is nice to have a chemical-free formula and it is definitely better than having something that doesn&#x27;t smell good, or is too strong. I think this oil adds just the right amount of shine. As far as my skin goes, Argan Alchemy makes it visibly smoother right away, and a lot softer. I do feel like it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well into my skin as it does my hair, so just beware of this - you will have a sleek and slightly oily texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this oil in exchange for an HONEST review on my blog.</li>
    <li> I love trying out new things and I loved this Argan oil it is great to use when your hair is still damp from getting out of the shower. All you need is just a little bit.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for your skin-- my skin sucked it up like it was sunshine. Helped with my itchy winter skin and scalp too</li>
    <li> Cant say enough good things about this product.  Your wrinkles will disappear and you will be amazed on how beautiful your hair looks. It is a must have and will be your beauty secret .  Thank you very much.  I ordered 2 and will be ordering more to horde them !</li>
    <li> Moroccan Argan Oil has been all the rage lately and I just had to try it for myself. When given the opportunity to review Argan Alchemy I was so ecstatic! I know we are supposed to use it on hair, but I wanted to try some other ways to use the oil as well. I had heard some claims on the internet and wanted to try them out. I rubbed this oil on my feet one night before going to sleep. I immediately noticed a drastic improvement in the skin. By morning, the skin was soft again! I am addicted, this works better than the cream I usually use on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by a few things. First off, the smell is that of fresh green olives. It took me by surprise, but it did wear off as soon as it was absorbed. It absorbed quickly and was shiny at first, but that also dissipated. It worked very well on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My &amp;#34;tween&amp;#34; daughter was dying to use it too. She had read the claims about it in her magazines. She used it on her hair as a mask and washed it the next morning. When she dried her hair, it was so shiny and soft. We were both amazed!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Argan oil for more than 2 months now. I love it!!! I like to use it on my face and nails. I use it before going to bed and the results in the morning are great: My skin looks so moister that even my make up sinks better! It looks healthier but not. greasy. My cuticles dont look so dry anymore. By the smell you can know that the oil is in its pure form, love using it knowing that it is natural! I recommend this Oil.</li>
