      <li>Lime Crime eyeliner is a great product and worth the price.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m always happy to find a liquid that&#x27;s easy to apply and pretty foolproof, and this ALWAYS looks good.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>, i love this I tell every one about it.</li>
      <li>This is the best white eyeliner I have used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the most competent makeup-doer</li>
      <li>Great intense white&lt;br /&gt;color.</li>
      <li>easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It goes on easy and smoothly.</li>
      <li>great matte white color.</li>
      <li>It is cruelty free</li>
      <li>You can get a good, solid line with this</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not good for accuracy and perfect lines.</li>
      <li>The brush is great for creating dramatic effects and the color is vivid and stays on great.</li>
      <li>you look super fresh.</li>
      <li>I may need to get a white kohl pencil and apply this over it for a fine, clean line.</li>
      <li>So far, the brush is fine and has not frayed.  </li>
      <li>Shows up white, flows easily, looks great combined with black eyeliner!</li>
      <li>I had to use a white NYX pencil and then put this on top to be able to use this on my lower last line.</li>
      <li>I lovev lime crime products so so much!</li>
      <li>The name is true it doesn&#x27;t smudge no hardly comes off.</li>
      <li>Lasts for a long time but also easy to remove!</li>
      <li>Application is easy - I&#x27;m not good with eyeliner and this goes on smoothly and easy.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have a crisp line, which really bugs me.</li>
      <li>It dries out very fast though, but other than that I love this product.</li>
      <li>but this has worked really well for me.</li>
      <li>I bought a white eyeliner from MAC and it went on kind of blue.</li>
      <li>Other then that it is lovely.</li>
      <li>I used white pencile it would smug and the liquid comes on clean</li>
      <li>Love the color - its a solid opaque white, which is what I wanted.</li>
      <li>But that is not my main reason for coming to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Actually needed an elegant white to use as face makeup.</li>
      <li>It is super white which is what I wanted</li>
      <li>The brush needs to be changed as well, it makes application harder when the hairs don&#x27;t form a fine point and some of them get bent from putting/</li>
      <li>After putting this one it&#x27;s not as smooth as I expected, ending up with a cracky look</li>
      <li>This particular product is completely underwhelming.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and does not easily run.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and allergies.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t write this in order to be a sensationalist, I write this in order to enable others to be conscious consumers.</li>
      <li>drying cracked because you can only see it very close up</li>
      <li>I would prefer a more blendable white, because I literally don&#x27;t know what to do with an eyeliner this stark white.</li>
      <li>In addition to the fact that Lime Crime has a history of dishonest business practices, all of their products that I have used (eyeshadows, eyeliners, nail polish, and lipsticks) including this one aren&#x27;t worth the money, much less the uneasy conscience that comes along with monetarily supporting such a company.</li>
      <li>I would recomend to anyone who was doing something a little different or just wants their whites to pop so</li>

<li> This stuff lasts an extremely long time.</li>
<li> this is the first and last eyeliner ill buy from them.</li>
<li> Same with the black.</li>
<li> Its really white and not transparent or runny but when it dries it does look a little cracked/chalky.</li>
<li> Product wasn&#x27;t in the packaging I literally received an empty envelope.</li>
<li> I began buying Lime Crime products roughly two years ago.</li>
<li> I tried applying it thick and then putting another color in a thinner line over it, but the second color coat just won&#x27;t go on smoothly enough.</li>
<li> Looking forward to purchasing other eyeliner products from this brand.</li>
<li> It is not really easy to blend, at least for me, I get a definite line of white, but I like it.</li>
<li> I would have given it 5 stars but the formula does crack a bit after it is applied so you kinda need to fix it a little after a while.</li>
<li> but their eyeliner is no better than any other brand</li>
<li> but it almost immediately got flaky after it dried.</li>
<li> months ago, Doe Deere&#x27;s (the owner of the brand) shady and unethical business practices were presented to me by a makeup artist friend of mine.</li>
<li> I look like an alien when I have it on.</li>
<li> This is not for the faint of heart.</li>
<li> Both times I&#x27;ve experiment this liner, I&#x27;ve had to redo my makeup, because the look failed.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this company.</li>
<li> but the brush is honestly terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Perfect. Bought if for dance team make up. Goes on easy and smooth and looks great!!!</li>
    <li> If you want a white liquid liner that literally goes on like liquid paper, this product is for you. It&#x27;s not for me, though. I look like an alien when I have it on. I would prefer a more blendable white, because I literally don&#x27;t know what to do with an eyeliner this stark white. I tried applying it thick and then putting another color in a thinner line over it, but the second color coat just won&#x27;t go on smoothly enough. Both times I&#x27;ve experiment this liner, I&#x27;ve had to redo my makeup, because the look failed. This is not for the faint of heart.</li>
    <li> Looking for over 10 years for a replacement for a Helena Rubinstein white liquid liner, finally found it! Fully opaque matte white, just like White Out. Stays on and doesn&#x27;t smudge. So happy with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff lasts an extremely long time. The name is true it doesn&#x27;t smudge no hardly comes off. In order to get it off you would need to scrub it or take it off with makeup remover! I lovev lime crime products so so much!</li>
    <li> I began buying Lime Crime products roughly two years ago. This particular product is completely underwhelming. But that is not my main reason for coming to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months ago, Doe Deere&#x27;s (the owner of the brand) shady and unethical business practices were presented to me by a makeup artist friend of mine. I don&#x27;t write this in order to be a sensationalist, I write this in order to enable others to be conscious consumers.

    <li> This eyeliner is Wonderful!!!! It goes on easy and smoothly. Great intense white&lt;br /&gt;color. Love Lime Crime products!!!!! Super colors!!!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find an opaque white. I was looking for something that looked like Liquid Paper! I bought a white eyeliner from MAC and it went on kind of blue. Lime Crime makes the very best products. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this company.</li>
    <li> You can get a good, solid line with this and it STANDS OUT. I&#x27;m not the most competent makeup-doer so I&#x27;m always happy to find a liquid that&#x27;s easy to apply and pretty foolproof, and this ALWAYS looks good. Same with the black.</li>
    <li> I react to everything but this has worked really well for me. It is very bright, like childrens paint, but cute. It is not really easy to blend, at least for me, I get a definite line of white, but I like it. It is cruelty free and I think it is vegan. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best white eyeliner I have used. Brilliant pigment, really easy to apply. It dries out very fast though, but other than that I love this product.</li>
    <li> Its really white and not transparent or runny but when it dries it does look a little cracked/chalky. I had to use a white NYX pencil and then put this on top to be able to use this on my lower last line. The brush needs to be changed as well, it makes application harder when the hairs don&#x27;t form a fine point and some of them get bent from putting/pulling the brush in/out of the tube. Also the brush tickles/itches esp on lower lash line lol i could deal with it drying cracked because you can only see it very close up but the brush is honestly terrible.</li>
    <li> After putting this one it&#x27;s not as smooth as I expected, ending up with a cracky look</li>
    <li> Limecrime lipstick is AMAZING but their eyeliner is no better than any other brand this is the first and last eyeliner ill buy from them. The applicator isn&#x27;t pointed on the end so it&#x27;s not good for accuracy and perfect lines. It is super white which is what I wanted but it almost immediately got flaky after it dried. UNACCEPTABLE, YO!!!</li>
    <li> Actually needed an elegant white to use as face makeup. This did the trick</li>
    <li> Shows up white, flows easily, looks great combined with black eyeliner! Lasts for a long time but also easy to remove!</li>
    <li> Love the color - its a solid opaque white, which is what I wanted. Application is easy - I&#x27;m not good with eyeliner and this goes on smoothly and easy. So far, the brush is fine and has not frayed.  But it dries crackly so you don&#x27;t have a crisp line, which really bugs me. I may need to get a white kohl pencil and apply this over it for a fine, clean line. Its lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice eyeliner. It is easy to apply and does not easily run. I would have given it 5 stars but the formula does crack a bit after it is applied so you kinda need to fix it a little after a while. Other then that it is lovely. I have sensitive skin and allergies. I had no problems with it at all. I would recomend to anyone who was doing something a little different or just wants their whites to pop so you look super fresh.</li>
    <li> easy to apply. great matte white color. i would recommend</li>
    <li> I am fan of 60&#x27;s makeup and I saw this white eyeliner and had to have it. The brush is great for creating dramatic effects and the color is vivid and stays on great. Lime Crime eyeliner is a great product and worth the price. Looking forward to purchasing other eyeliner products from this brand.</li>
    <li> It was not as opaque as I wanted it to be, but it does a great job.</li>
    <li> this a best thing ever. I used white pencile it would smug and the liquid comes on clean, i love this I tell every one about it.</li>
