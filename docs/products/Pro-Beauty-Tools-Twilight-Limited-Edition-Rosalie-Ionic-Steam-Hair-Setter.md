<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hot rollers are hot rollers. These work as expected.</li>
    <li> I got these rollers based on mainly positive reviews; should have focused on the negative ones. I have used Caruso for years and they work great, just wearing out, so I thought why not try these?  After all they are they same concept, the same style rollers, steam, and I like that they were all large.  Well there is no comparison!  First of all they leave the hair wet when the rollers are removed. (I rolled exactly the same way I have been doing with the Caruso&#x27;s for many years.  I am an old hand at this) Left them in the right amount of time and normally there is a few minutes to let them set after taking the rollers out; with these, the curls just fall because they are damp, then the hair is frizzy, with little body.  I even tried using my Caruso steamer base with these rollers but obviously the rollers themselves retain the moisture that stays in the hair.  I don&#x27;t think the material in these rollers gets hot enough to steam a curl. I am back to my Caruso and am replacing some large rollers.  It never disappoints. Pretty curls that last!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how well my curls turned out on just the first try. This product was very easy to use and managed to tame my lion&#x27;s mane-like hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great curler. I can use it everyday without damaging my hair. This product is awesome, the curl looks so natural and it is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> hey there.  i bought it at a locl store nearby where i live.  i have used it 3 times and i love the way my hair looks after i use it. my hair is very thick and it&#x27;s very difficult to curl it. well... with this little wonder my hair is curly and very gorgeous!! the curls are very natural looking, and i coouldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  this is the first steam setter i have ever used.  so this may seem a bit biased, lol. anyway i love it and it&#x27;s very easy for me to use.  i gave it a five star review because i&#x27;m so pleased with the results it gave me.</li>
    <li> These curlers do everything as promised -- long-lasting, beautiful shiny curls without damaging your hair.  Very easy to use.  Strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love it. Came very promptly.It has all Jumbo size rollers. If you want other sizes they need to be ordered seperate and in a different color unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a steam roller junkie since 1996.  Though I&#x27;ve bought Caruso in the mid-90s, I felt like its steam output was really slow.  I was fortunate enough to buy something like it with Videl Sasson (for roughly the same price) and that steamer has worked for me faithfully since 1998.  But my rollers soon gave out somewhere around 2001, and I wanted to replace them.  I bought the Caruso ones from my local beauty store, and thought that the 6 rollers alone was almost as much what I paid for the whole set back in college!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t roll my hair everyday, so to say that I don&#x27;t use my set everyday, but the rollers are getting nasty again.  So I decided to buy more rollers only, but stumbled upon this product by Pro Beauty Tools.  I decided to buy it because for the curlers alone, I would be paying a lot more.  I like the jumbo sized ones best any how, so that seemed like a really good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steam output is even.  When I put it on the ionic steam mode, it make an annoying ticking sound so I just went to regular steam mode.  I think the complaints of other buyers about it making their head &amp;#34;soggy&amp;#34; with steam is because they&#x27;re used to the old Caruso steam machine&#x27;s output - which I thought was extremely weak.  If you don&#x27;t want a soggy head, just take them out faster than you&#x27;re used to, that&#x27;s all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the color scheme of this set - it matches with my other hair supplies better and seems more stylish because of the black.  I didn&#x27;t care for Twilight or the actress that this was suppose to be built for (the Rosalie character), but the symbol doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re used to using a steam hair setting system.  It&#x27;s a lot less damaging than hot irons for those who have never tried it, and for less than $30, it&#x27;s really worth a shot.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great steam roller set. With previous sets I&#x27;ve owned I never used the smaller rollers, so I especially like that this only includes the large rollers and there are plenty of them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been very good at styling my hair (aside from dragging a flat iron through it) but these rollers are so easy to use, even I couldn&#x27;t mess it up. The clips will dent your hair, but some creative rolling hides that. I have straight, fine hair that barely holds a curl when using a curling iron, but with the steam rollers my curls last all day.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set, as well as the set that has all medium rollers, for my daughters and I.  We all three have very thick and long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this set, I taught my 12 year-old how to roll her sister&#x27;s hair.  Then, she decided to roll her own hair.  She has hair to her waist and VERY thick. LET ME ADD THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAS EVER ROLLED HER OWN HAIR, AND SHE WAS COMPLETELY UNASSISTED.  She used a mix of medium rollers from the other set I ordered, as well as these jumbo rollers, and her hair came out beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some useful tips that we&#x27;ve discovered as we use them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Leave the shield on the roller when you place it on top of the steam and leave it there for 10-15 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;2) Then, when you take the roller off the steamer, remove the shield and place it back on the steam spindle while you place the roller in your hair.  (Leaving the shield on the steamer helps to seal in the steam better, while adding heat to the outside of the roller.)&lt;br /&gt;3) Roll your hair tightly around the roller if you want more curl.&lt;br /&gt;4) Leave rollers in your hair for 45-60 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will look beautiful. If my 12 year-old can do this (and it&#x27;s her first time), anyone can :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally ordered this set for myself, but will share it with my daughter. I think this is a safe way for her to learn how to roll her hair. I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s quite ready for hot rollers yet.  Besides, these offer damage-free styling.</li>
    <li> I love these curlers, the only reason I bought twilight curlers was because the price was right and the roller size is perfect. I have natural hair that comes to the middle of my back and I can use these both with my hair flat ironed and in its natural state, they work better with straightened hair but I do not use relaxers. My curls are soft, shinny and pretty and they last all day. They do not come out frizzy or fuzzy. I love love love love them.</li>
    <li> Curls are very loose and pull apart very fast.</li>
    <li> I tried my steamer the day after I recieved it.  It arrived very quickly, two days after I ordered it.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!!!My hair is thick, and coarse, and I am African American  I was concerned that my hair would come out frizzy, but to my pleasant surprise my hair was shiny, bouncy, and beautiful. My hair is shoulder length, and with the jumbo rollers I still had big, beautiful hollywood curls. It took me about 15 minutes to roll and 15 minutes to set, and believe me I didnt do my best job, as I had a phone to my ear the whole time:) but still awesome results will be buying another one for my daughters soon! Thanks Pro Beauty Tools!</li>
    <li> I chose this set over the Caruso because I have long hair and with this you get 20 jumbo rollers instead of a variety of sizes. The larger rollers produce looser curls and soft waves. Only used it once and it worked well. Overall a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Perfect hairsetter for ladies with thick hair. Comes with only jumbo curlers (and shields), but you can wind your hair tighter if you need a more defined curl. Caruso steam rollers will fit this unit if you want more size options. I personally just use the steam setting instead of the ionic steam setting because it makes this loud ticking noise. But I talked with a pro beauty tools representative and it is suppose to make that noise. It is just a little nerve racking when you are doing your hair. I would recommend this to anyone with thick hair. It will help with frizz and makes beautiful curls. On the twilight side: all the curlers are black (so cool!), unit is purple and black with twilight logo, clear plastic storage bag with twilight logo for storing rollers, and there is a cardboard card with a picture of Rosalie with hair setting instructions on the back.</li>
    <li> This is actually my back up hair setter because I could not be without one just in case something happened to my other ionic hair setter.  This product styles my hair perfectly and most importantly protects my hair from damage.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this curling method or machine.  It was messy and just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I wish it did!</li>
    <li> I was hopeful that this product would work on my long fine hair.  I liked it because it doesn&#x27;t use heat to style and also has all jumbo rollers.  The product steams one curler at a time and does this quickly so you never have to wait.  By the time you finish rolling one curler the next one is ready.  I&#x27;ve tried it twice with the same results.  First time it didn&#x27;t hold curl in my hair at all.  I figured maybe my hair was still slightly damp from shampooing so gave it another try before passing judgment.  The next time I made sure my hair was dry and left the curlers in the recommended 15-20 min.  There was a slight curl at the very bottom of my hair but this only lasted a few minutes.  While I love the idea of this hair setter I can&#x27;t give it any more stars because it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine, thin blonde hair.  These work great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I bought them as I was searching for the Caruso Steam rollers, and found this Twillght one had all Jumbo rollers; at a much better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for what I wanted.  Sets nice, lasts all day, even on my hair!!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and this product just isn&#x27;t curling it.  It will last about 20 minutes then it&#x27;s straight again.</li>
    <li> But, you only get large rollers - and they really are large so - they were great for my daughter, whos hair is very long.&lt;br /&gt;But, for me with shoulder length hair - it was a challenge.</li>
    <li> it curls my hair so beautifully I love this product. my hair looks curled like Rosalie in BDP1 and 2. You will love this product</li>
    <li> The steamer itself works great. The rollers themselves I don&#x27;t like. I previously had a similar set by Caruso and much preferred their rollers. The sponges on these rollers seem to absorb too much water from the steamer. However, the caruso rollers fit on the steamer so I use my old caruso rollers with this steamer.</li>
    <li> I really like this set of curlers mostly because it takes the frizz out of my hair, even on the dampest days.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy and is a really great product.  Now looking for a few small rollers. Thank you</li>
    <li> The item did not do what I was expecting.  Different types of hair react differently.</li>
    <li> Happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I just pretend it&#x27;s not Twilight.</li>
    <li> First off, my hair curls very easily. I have long, fine, wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used curling irons for years, the kind that you put water inside that create steam. I&#x27;ve also used the kind where all the curlers sit on little heated rods that you add water to to create steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to curl my hair again and learned these weren&#x27;t being made anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all these glowing reviews about these setters and decided to give it a try. The Twilight one was the cheapest one I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first took the curlers out of the package I noticed a horrible chemical smell. It reeked. I did not want my hair to smell like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked the curlers in borax and lemon. All this black dye came out in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting the curlers air dry and repeating the process a few times, this got rid of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also watched the Twilight video on how to use the curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and my hair looked great for 1/2 hour and then all the curls fell out and looked stringy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this 5 times with different styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Styling lotion made it fall in 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was even worse with hairspray. My hair matted up like cotton candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually went to the thrift store and found an old, steam, curling iron for $6. This did a much better job and my curls lasted all day.</li>
    <li> I used something similar to this for 20 years, so I&#x27;ve mastered the art of using steam curlers. It was time to replace the one I had and this one works great. Knocked off a star for not providing other sizes; as they just give you the large size. I read the other negative reviews and I can give tips on how to get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, your hair must be dry before rolling. Second, put the curler on the steam for about 10 seconds. You don&#x27;t need any more time than that or the curler will be too saturated and will take longer to dry. Third, while you are winding your hair around the curler, place the cap that goes on the curler over the steam as well. It&#x27;s then important to give your hair at least 1.5  hours to set, before taking them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip for glamorous curls that I learned when I was modeling years ago - If your hair is at least medium length, turn your head upside down, and make a ponytail on the very top of your head. Use a fabric &amp;#34;rubber band&amp;#34; so not to leave a crease. Then, with this crazy ponytail, sprouting from the very middle, and top of your head, separate your hair into 4 to 6 sections, depending on how much hair you have. Take each section and twist the hair before rolling it. Follow the steps above and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Today I used my Pro Beauty Tools Twilight Limited Edition Rosalie Ionic Steam Hair Setter for only the THIRD time.  While the curls turned out beautifully, the unit broke!  The little post that you set the roller on snapped off part of the way.  Pretty disappointing to have something break so quickly.  I wasn&#x27;t being aggressive, just tried to place the roller on and noticed it had broken.  Sad part is that I have discarded the packaging and invoice so I have no recourse.  :-(  They need to come up with a sturdier post to set the roller on.  I will not be reordering.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. The product was as described. Shipping and prices were very reasonable. The product itself is a little tricky and takes some practice getting your curls how you want them with long hair.</li>
    <li> Love this.Keeps the curl in my hair for days. Glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> I have had others in the past &amp; it does not steam as much as they did, but it works for the price</li>
    <li> The box came damaged, looks like it has dried up dirt on it?! It had a small hole in the box. I really wanted to try these and couldn&#x27;t wait for a new set, so I gave it a go. I have extremely thick wavy hair. These curlers did a great job. I normally do not curl my hair so can&#x27;t compare to other rollers, but it was quicker and easier than using a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ionic setting is the most un-nerving ticking noise you have ever heard outside a mechanics shop. I thought for sure it was just my unit, due to the damaged box, but see that others have had the same problem. Won&#x27;t be using that setting, nothing is worth that noise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product. Disappointed in the packaging and shape of product. Feel like I bought it at the swap meet, not exciting getting a new product that looks like I bought it off of a blanket somewhere.</li>
    <li> These steam rollers are great!</li>
    <li> I keep these in stock in my closet...the thought of being without one gives me an anxiety attack! I have fine limp hair...a curling iron does nothing but make it look like straw hair and will not keep a curl.  Steam rollers are the BEST!  Highly recommend...no complaints from me.  And fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> In the past I had the Caruso rollers where you added salt.  After reading the reviews here I bought these and am so disappointed!  Am mad at myself that I kept trying them expecting different results.  I AGREE with other reviewers that the curls quickly disappear and are not nearly as defined as with my other steam rollers!</li>
    <li> I love that you can choose ionic or regular steam.  Ionic gives a real firm curl that lasts for days.  Using the regular setting, you get a real nice curl or wave too, depending how long you steam the roller and how tight you roll your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The whole unit works nicer than a Caruso, but doesn&#x27;t hold near the amount of water a Caruso does...You&#x27;ll definitely need to refill it often--like, after every use.&lt;br /&gt;The color is nice too...looks classier sitting on my makeup table.&lt;br /&gt;I like too that they include a booklet on how to style your hair like &amp;#34;Rosalie&amp;#34;--if you&#x27;re into Twilight...I&#x27;m not--I just really liked her hairstyle and wanted to try one similar.&lt;br /&gt;Best part--the rollers are non-damaging so your hair won&#x27;t get burned or dried out. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> I loved my old Richard Caruso rollers but they finally died and I was really happy to see these with lots of big rollers....my old rollers work as well..so I have multiple sizes.  Work great and the price was excellent.</li>
    <li> I got these curlers because I wanted to the soft curl look, I don&#x27;t care about Twilight.  I liked how all the curlers were large, no smalls.  It was easy to use, but it took a long time for my hair to put all the curlers in. When the curlers were first taken out I had a great curl, but curls do not last; and for the time it takes to put all of these guys in it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday.  Steam is one of the best hot roller systems for your hair. It&#x27;s comes with tons of usable rollers for any style and is really easy to use.  Heats up in seconds so even when your running late your out the door in time.</li>
    <li> By far the best curls your ever going to get from a hair curling system. I would suggest you purchased this item or anything similar to it. It&#x27;s the healthiest way to curl you hair.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with purchase.  Arrived much sooner than expected!  This is an excellent hair setter.  Bought this one as a back up.</li>
    <li> I chose this set because I wanted large rollers rather than a selection of sizes. They are easy to use and the curls last a long time.</li>
    <li> I was looking into buying curlers to alleviate some of the time spent curling with a traditional curling iron. I have long(ish-about 18 inches) thinner hair, so the traditional multiple sized curlers wouldnt cut it for me. I would likely need to buy 2 sets &amp; set the smaller curlers out to pasture. When I saw this set, I couldnt believe my eyes--all jumbo curlers, and cheaper than the regular set? Oh....wait...it has Twilight written on it. Oh no. Whatever, I dont have to follow R Pats &amp; K Stew to enjoy curly hair, so I bought them and hoped no one would see the package delivered to my door. Luckily, it was in a brown box and I opened it in the privacy of my own bathroom. I do love these curlers with one exception: the clips. God almighty, these U shaped clips are completely useless. I went &amp; purchased some traditional curler clips from Sally&#x27;s (reason why I deducted 2 stars) &amp; haven&#x27;t looked back since. This really is a great set, but I strongly suggest using distilled water, or at the very least, filtered water. I can definitely see how the mechanism can get clogged with just regular tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, Id also like to comment on the resiliency of the plastic. My bulldog got ahold of the water chamber &amp; there was minimal damage. Way to go Pro Beauty!</li>
    <li> I have long platinum (dyed) hair which this product is AMAZING for!! I &amp;#60;3 the results, and it makes my hair feel *better when I use it. I love that this set comes in a nice color way (purple/black) and consists of only the large size rollers (better for voluminous waves). *I was afraid the Twilight logo would be silly, but its small and I prefer this much more than the regular Caruso red/cream set. Wonderful buy.. couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Pro Beauty Tools, Twilight Rosalie Ionic hair  setter is the best! It is compact, easy to use and fast for those quick touch up.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of long fine hair... I wrapped it exactly like the \\&quot;Twilight\\&quot; video, using all 20 rollers... the curl was nice and, yeah, lasted until I got to the the restaurant, then, although it had some body, there was no curl left. I admit it was hot outside but no where did it state you had to remain inside to achieve results... the rollers are easy on the hair and, like I said, give it body, but the curl was very mimimal... I&#x27;ll keep trying different ways of doing it... also I am NOT a big hairspray fan, don&#x27;t like stiff hair, so maybe that was part of the issue?? Who knows?</li>
    <li> This product is completely worthless. Did not do what it suppose to do. Save your money and buy something that actually works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s funny to read reviews that claim the Caruso is better. This is exactly the same as the Caruso, but molded from black and purple plastic with a creepy \\&quot;twilight\\&quot; theme. (I have never watched the twilight show - it&#x27;s some teenage vampire series or movie or something. Who cares, not me.) Also the kit comes only with JUMBO/LARGE rollers.&lt;br /&gt;I used a Caruso for a couple of years, but I did not clean it (did not read instructions - totally my fault) and it stopped working. I purchased this Twilight version from Amazon, and found it is identical except for the color and roller size. Since I already had plenty of rollers from my old Caruso, I made no change to how I was fixing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The color of the unit makes no difference to me since I keep it in my bathroom cabinet anyway.&lt;br /&gt;For the price difference, I&#x27;d buy a similar steamer with Sponge Bob, Helly Kitty, whatever they want to put on it. It&#x27;s a great NON DAMAGING steam roller set. The curls do not last a long time on my hair because my long hair has been heavily hennaed and weighs too much; still I like the way this roller set smooths my hair and keeps it nearly straight.</li>
    <li> These are literally the best curlers I&#x27;ve found !!! They are super quick easy to use and give an awesome blow out look !! Plus hair is so soft afterwards !! I used to use curling irons and wanted to try something that would be easier and I will never go back !! I hope you like them ! Amazon shipped them quickly!</li>
    <li> it gives me soft curls, just perfect. I had the other more popular brand, but it didn&#x27;t work out of the box. So I am glad this one works  :D</li>
    <li> This product works, but not as well as expected.  The curls weren&#x27;t as defined as expected and didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> For reference, I have just-above shoulder length hair that is fine but thick. This looked like a nice set of rollers when I opened the box. But they didn&#x27;t just NOT work; they were very hard to use, AND impossible to store easily, AND made wrinkles in my hair. I bought these because there were plenty of large/jumbo rollers. But they came in a soft plastic bag; once a few were taken out of the bag and there weren&#x27;t enough left to make the bag stand up, the rest spilled all over and were difficult to get out with one hand - which is all you have available if you&#x27;re rolling your hair and grabbing one roller at a time. There was some type of slightly-heavier plastic bag included for storage, but I didn&#x27;t even open it. It would&#x27;ve been just as difficult to use as the one they were shipped in. The cylinder-shaped covers, which are supposed to hold the rollers in place in your hair, had to each be taken off the individual rollers first, set aside, and then placed on each section of rolled hair. (Too much time &amp; effort; too much room needed to spread all the stuff out). THAT was another battle; getting them on was tricky enough - if you don&#x27;t seat the cover exactly right, with the roller fitting precisely between the ends of the cover - it won&#x27;t go on. Keeping my rolled hair in place was IMPOSSIBLE; I didn&#x27;t even have to move my head for the rolls to come loose and flop around and fall out. What a nightmare!!! Even though all the rollers appeared to be made exactly the same, some of them just would not heat/steam up when held onto the steaming &amp;#34;pin&amp;#34;; can&#x27;t even begin to understand why that happened. It took me well over an hour to struggle with the covers and rollers, roll as much of my hair as I could get to stay rolled at one time, attempt to let the hair on all the rollers dry, then take the clips out. And when I did take the clips out, I had crimps as wide as the rollers in all the sections around my face and at the top of my head. Those aren&#x27;t all my complaint, but that&#x27;s enough. I was so disgusted I wanted to throw them away; but I&#x27;m not wasting my money like that. They next day they were back in the box and two days later they were being shipped back.but that&#x27;s enough. I was so disgusted I wanted to throw them away; but I&#x27;m not wasting my money like that. They next day they were back in the box and two days later they were being shipped back.</li>
    <li> Has lasted longer than any other of my ionic steamers by far.  Don&#x27;t know what the difference is but I use it almost daily and would buy one again.</li>
    <li> Love it and use it almost everyday.  This is something I can&#x27;t live without.  Have use one for many years.</li>
    <li> I bought the Pro Beauty steamer to replace my Caruso Pro which suddenly stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is small but heats up very fast with alot of steam. I&#x27;m very happy with how my hair looks.</li>
    <li> I find it odd that no other reviews mention the annoying clicking sound when the unit is switched to Ionic.  On the steam setting there is no clicking sound.  It is rather annoying to say the least and can&#x27;t understand why the unit does it.  From reading other questions posed by others, it seems to be the norm.  No instructions as to how long it takes for a roller to be fully heated.  From other reviews, its around 15-20 seconds per roller.  Shouldn&#x27;t have to come and read reviews to find out though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that set aside, I have around 80% gray hair with a color weave.  Gray hair is so darn stubborn!  I wanted to try a hairsetter that had all large rollers.  Just recently threw away several old one that I had as I had gone to a curling iron some years ago.  While a curling iron is nice, its a pain to have to stand there so long holding sections of hair and hoping you don&#x27;t burn your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, back to this curler set.  It does as advertised and I like the fact that I don&#x27;t run out of rollers!  It did take a couple of rollers to get used to feel of the foam.  The clips are just that, they clip over the roller.  Took a few tries to get the hang of it but I love the fact that they are not digging into your scalp.  Depending on how tightly you roll your hair, I guess results will be different.  I just wanted body so didn&#x27;t wind the hair really tight and it sure delivered just what I wanted.  How long the curl stays in I can&#x27;t attest too yet since this is my first day using it.  Will update once I have used it for a week. Us silver sisters are always in the need for a good hairsetter and I think I found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So despite the annoying clicking sounds, I rated by its ease of use and desired results.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend so I&#x27;ve not used it my self but my friend loves it thanx</li>
    <li> After only 6 months of use, one morning it made a popping sound and never steamed again!  I ordered a Revlon steamer to replace it.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I believe this is the same model mold that Revlon uses. It works as expected, plus has a dark Twilight theme to it. I think it would make a great gift for any twilight fan who wants to have nice curly wavy hair. I have long hair and it works great- almost as good as the Caruso brand does- the only tiny difference is that it seems that the Caruso brand has hotter steam. I have not use that ionic feature is all it does is seem to make a weird noise, and I don&#x27;t like the sound of weird noises. It also comes with a nice clear bag with the my Twilight logo on it. All in all, I am happy with my purchase. Good deal, and it was cheaper the the Caruso units I normally buy.</li>
    <li> Best value for the price you can possibly find.&lt;br /&gt;I have long, staight, thick hair and this beauty tool is what I have been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;This product comes with 20 (!) jumbo (medium) rollers, portable bag to keep rollers in and heating base. Before ordering this hair setter, I&#x27;ve tried couple different hot rollers from different brands and no one left me as satisfyed as Twilight did.</li>
    <li> Although it acts the same as my old steam rollers this one simply does not produce lasting curls. They appear fine when I take the rollers out but within minutes have fallen to almost straight. I get all day, long lasting curls from a curling iron but these simply do not last. My hair has natural wave and curls at the end and is mid-length I only needed a boost for fullness and these curlers pull all the curl out and leave my hair limp and almost straight. Not good for my type of hair at the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, not good for me. Product does work as described, not sure why it fails to deliver for me.</li>
    <li> After 10 years, my hair setter gave out...I searched high and low for a replacement at a decent price. I came across the Twilight hair setter with a great price. Have been using it now for a month. Works great except for the ionic click so I don&#x27;t use that setting. Terrific product.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and she loved it. A few weeks later it broke. The seller replaced it right away, great to deal with. Thank you!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work great because left hair too damp</li>
    <li> a waste of money.. It did not even curl the hair.</li>
    <li> Rollers are too big and the unit was barely producing any steam.  It&#x27;s very noisy when you have it on the ionic setting.  It almost sounds like electricity popping when its on the ionic setting.</li>
    <li> Healing my split ends already. Very easy to use and small so will travel well. Love that the rollers are all large</li>
    <li> These work well.  I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t do fancy-hair very often.  But these are perfect when I do - very quick &amp; they make nice, big, soft curls which hold in my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I am a professional hairstylist, licensed. And I wanted to buy a set of rollers to give that \\&quot;hot roller look\\&quot; to hair. I searched for a set that would be versatile, easy to work with, one that would travel well, one that worked quickly, one that had enough rollers and one that would not damage the hair! And one that would NOT be super expensive!    I found ALL of those in this Twilight Limited Edition Ionic Steam Hair Setter!!!    I LOVE IT!!! \\&quot;10&#x27;S ACROSS THE BOARD!!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Beautiful. My hair is softer after using it. The curls hold all day, but softly, not like the eighties plastic look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The videos on youtube on how to get Rosalie&#x27;s look helped immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, great product, great product support, great customer education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more could anyone want?</li>
    <li> I was thrilled when this \\&quot;limited edition\\&quot; was offered since I only need the large rollers. I&#x27;ve used steam-setters for years and love, love, love the way the steam works. Roll, leave in while you do your makeup and have breakfast, take the rollers out and Voila! lovely curls that last (especially if your hair is conditioned properly). Some tips: When you take the rollers down, immediately form into the style you want - don&#x27;t wait for the curls to set outside the roller. Leaving the rollers in longer gives longer-lasting curls but the curlers will be just as you rolled them so roll in the direction you want the curls to go and be careful to smooth the ends on the rollers as you roll each section! Also, if the foam rollers give you more curl than you desire, use the steam unit but instead of using the foam rollers included, pick up a pack of your choice of size of plastic curlers with lots of air holes, and use clips like the Salon Pro Champion Roller Clips (butterfly-type clips), and you&#x27;ll also need to use a small cup (I use the orange top of a Coconut Oil Spray bottle or the clear dispenser cup from the family size bottle of Tide detergent) to cover the plastic-type rollers to hold in steam. This method gives you less curl but lots of body - and will tame natural curls. The butterfly-type clips leave less marks in your hair than the clips provided with the unit do.</li>
