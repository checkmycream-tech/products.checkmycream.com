      <li>It&#x27;s a great item...</li>
      <li>Otherwise I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
      <li>Great item for travel also.</li>
      <li>A nice,clean,germ-free toothbrush is a great feeling.      </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great because it doubles as a travel carrying case for your toothbrush,</li>
      <li>Besides that, its a great product.  </li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>Good price on this product.  </li>
      <li>Glad we found the comments!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>Initially I really liked this product.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice to have a switch that would allow you turn it on rather than keeping it in ready-mode all the time.</li>
      <li>The unit looks nice and worked just fine.    </li>
      <li>I recommend this for anyone who travels to help keep you healthy.</li>
      <li>You can always be sure it&#x27;s working</li>
      <li>I still love this after having for a couple of years.  </li>
      <li>and I love it and feel safe to be healthier</li>
      <li>A better unit design would be an on/off switch for when the unit is traveling to avoid inadvertent power cycles.    </li>
      <li>I bought this item for both my husband and I as we travel alot on the weekends, and we love it.  </li>
      <li>Now we have a safe place to store our toothbrushes on the go..</li>
      <li>This premature wearing indicates cheap parts.</li>
      <li>Not a scientist, but also doubt the strength of the UV light.  </li>
      <li>The light switches on, but it does not switch off automatically after 16 minutes as they claim.</li>
      <li>you can see the light go on when you close the lid &amp; when it goes off, you know the brush is sanitized.    </li>
      <li>Overall this is great product.</li>
      <li>The UV light no longer works after 3 weeks.  </li>
      <li>Also, when it did work, the light stayed on and eat up the batteries.  </li>
      <li>This item isn&#x27;t worth your money!</li>
      <li>I can recommend it for travel, but for regular use, it&#x27;s best to stick with one of those larger, plug-in units.  </li>
      <li>Would not recommend this product and surprised that Sunbeam has not done a better job at this technology.  </li>
      <li>We are thrilled with the Sunbeam cases such that we will look for them by name again when we need another.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had salivary gland cancer &amp; due to the radiation &amp; lack of saliva,I need to brush my teeth more than most people.    </li>
      <li>For the first few weeks, it worked great.  </li>
      <li>Whether it actually does what is says, this certainly &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; better for me to have my brush completely enclosed. :)</li>
      <li>We have had no variableness in the bulb or connections but consistent performance in both of our cases.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it sanitizes the brush after each use and it stays stored in the case until the next use.</li>
      <li>First, the plate where the brush seats has discolored, probably as a result of water from the toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this item in a local store every couple years for a long time, but it is no longer carried by any local stores, so I was very glad to be able to buy it online!</li>
      <li>So using the regular alkaline or even cheap brand rechargeable batteries can get costly fast.</li>
      <li>I thought I would really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Gave to my whole family for Xmas.</li>
      <li>These gizmos are absolutely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
      <li>I travel a lot, often have problems with teeth and gums and this really seemed what I needed.</li>
      <li>Thanks to whoever invented this.</li>
      <li>sold by companies looking to make a fast buck.</li>
      <li>Drains your battery too fast because of this.</li>
      <li>I really have to force mine into the space in this one</li>
      <li>Batteries are easy to replace for long use.  </li>
      <li>and I just have to put new ones!</li>
      <li>Works as described but as another poster mentioned, it comes on when it gets bumped around, so it really takes a lot of batteries if you travel frequently.</li>
      <li>Each time I would toss it in my luggage and arrive at a new destination I would find the unit was on.  </li>
      <li>NEW 1500 eneloop 4 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries]]</li>
      <li>Even just using this at home it seems to need new batteries about every 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>It Powers on by closing the door and automatically turns off exactly 16 minutes later.</li>
      <li>So, if you don&#x27;t mind replacing batteries every few weeks, it works fine.  </li>
      <li>The blue light turns on as soon as the door is closed and turns off 16 minutes</li>
      <li>My unit has worked flawlessly so far and am yet to experience any problem.</li>
      <li>It has so far worked as advertised.</li>
      <li>i can&#x27;t really tell if this product is actually killing any bacteria.  </li>
      <li>After using a different brand for several years, either the bulb burned out or it got too much gunk inside to work.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Given all that, it seems your money would be better spent betting \\&quot;Hard 8\\&quot; at the Craps table in Vegas.</li>
      <li>Case is slightly smaller than the VioLight travel case I was replacing, toothbrush fits in, but just barely!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Products like these should be tested for such defects before being sold to the general public.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Think about it for just a minute. These gizmos are absolutely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Anything that gets on your toothbrush head was ALREADY in your mouth. Unless you think your houseguests are cleaning their shoe soles with your toothbrush while you aren&#x27;t looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) You are sitting a wet toothbrush head in this gizmo. Which means it is sitting in a puddle of water that is likely to mold/mildew. So you can put mold/mildew INTO your mouth (that was NOT in your mouth before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) The puddle of water is likely to (a) rust out the innards of this gizmo and (b) short-circuit the gizmo&#x27;s electronics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) The American Dental Association says these gizmos have no proven beneficial health benefits:&lt;br /&gt;  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all that, it seems your money would be better spent betting \\&quot;Hard 8\\&quot; at the Craps table in Vegas.</li>
    <li> I was very happy when I found this item. I travel a lot, often have problems with teeth and gums and this really seemed what I needed. I have it since a couples of weeks and I have already used 8  batteries. The light switches on, but it does not switch off automatically after 16 minutes as they claim. It stays on unless I open the box, which I try to do, but when I forget I find the batteries have been depleted and I just have to put new ones! Not a good buy at all.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t really tell if this product is actually killing any bacteria.  the toothbrush stays damp, even after drying if off with a hand towel.  i hate using a wet toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is a very poor product.  It lasted about two months, and then the bulb died.  Also, when it did work, the light stayed on and eat up the batteries.  I had to replace the batteries on a weekly basis.  That gets expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products like these should be tested for such defects before being sold to the general public.  They are a waste of hard earned money... sold by companies looking to make a fast buck.</li>
    <li> Gave to my whole family for Xmas. Has to be a helpful cold and flu determent.Great item for travel also.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a total of four Personal Toothbrush Sanitizers - One for myself and three for gifts.  I love the fact that it sanitizes the brush after each use and it stays stored in the case until the next use.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for both my husband and I as we travel alot on the weekends, and we love it.  This slim design fits perfectlly in your travel bag and sanitizes your toothbrush until the next brushing.  We used to use the plastic protective toothbrush toppers that would keep your tooth brush wet the entire time you were traveling which causes germs.  Now we have a safe place to store our toothbrushes on the go..It&#x27;s a great item...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had salivary gland cancer &amp; due to the radiation &amp; lack of saliva,I need to brush my teeth more than most people.    I use this sanitizer all day &amp; every day.  I have two of them.  One,I carry in my purse so I can brush my teeth after lunch at work also.  No need to carry around a wet toothbrush that is undoubtedly breeding germs. The other one,I use to store my toothbrush at home.    A nice,clean,germ-free toothbrush is a great feeling.      You can always be sure it&#x27;s working becasuse you can see the light go on when you close the lid &amp; when it goes off, you know the brush is sanitized.    Good price on this product.  My other one was more expensive, but the same thing.    It&#x27;s a little heavy to carry in my purse, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Works as described but as another poster mentioned, it comes on when it gets bumped around, so it really takes a lot of batteries if you travel frequently. Even just using this at home it seems to need new batteries about every 3 weeks. Case is slightly smaller than the VioLight travel case I was replacing, toothbrush fits in, but just barely!</li>
    <li> Rapid response to the order.  Works great but I learned if it gets bumped or jostled with the lid closed, the switch is so sensitive it starts the sanitizer cycle.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and my brother and I have followed the advice given to dry toothbrush before putting it into the cases. Glad we found the comments! We are on our 3rd or 4th case and were having a hard time to find a replacement. We are thrilled with the Sunbeam cases such that we will look for them by name again when we need another. This is not something we bought for travel but for daily use. We have had no variableness in the bulb or connections but consistent performance in both of our cases.</li>
    <li> The description says AAA batteries and some reviews mention to stock up on AAA batteries, but this unit takes 2 AA batteries.  Besides that, its a great product.  UPDATE: The UV light no longer works after 3 weeks.  I contacted Sunbean and they do not warranty the unit.  It is no longer supported by any company.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Admittedly I was skeptical at first. I travel a lot and usually get sick every few months from all that bad air in planes and trains. Hasn&#x27;t happened since I bought this. And my dentist says he thinks this has helped. I recommend this for anyone who travels to help keep you healthy.</li>
    <li> I travel internationally and purchased this to keep germs at bay while abroad.  The unit looks nice and worked just fine.    My low rating is over the design of the unit.    Each time I would toss it in my luggage and arrive at a new destination I would find the unit was on.  While packed n the suitcase the unit would start another power cycle.  End result is dead batteries after a few days of traveling.    My hack is to remove the batteries and reinstall upon arrival.  A better unit design would be an on/off switch for when the unit is traveling to avoid inadvertent power cycles.    After 3 weeks of use the plate under brush head has tarnished.  This premature wearing indicates cheap parts.</li>
    <li> Initially I really liked this product.  I used it nightly and replaced the batteries once during a three month period.  But then the bulb died.  And the bulb in the unit is not replaceable.  So it&#x27;s usefulness was short-lived - only three months - and it was a disappointment.  I can recommend it for travel, but for regular use, it&#x27;s best to stick with one of those larger, plug-in units.  I&#x27;m going to try the Violight next.</li>
    <li> Worked once with the batteries provided.  Then stopped working.  I then replaced the batteries, it worked once.  Then stopped working.  Repeat twice.  Take the batteries out and try them in something else, that item works.  This item isn&#x27;t worth your money!</li>
    <li> What a POS! It eats batteries like a dog eats treats and stopped working after a couple of months. DO NOT buy it unless you have rechargeable batteries and don&#x27;t need it to work very long.</li>
    <li> I keep it in a drawer and any time the drawer opens or closes, the sanitizer turns on. It would be nice to have a switch that would allow you turn it on rather than keeping it in ready-mode all the time. Otherwise I&#x27;m happy with the product. Compact for traveling too.</li>
    <li> I still love this after having for a couple of years.  It&#x27;s great because it doubles as a travel carrying case for your toothbrush, not just&lt;br /&gt;sterilizing periodically.  Batteries are easy to replace for long use.  Thanks to whoever invented this.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item in a local store every couple years for a long time, but it is no longer carried by any local stores, so I was very glad to be able to buy it online!</li>
    <li> Sunbeam #SBUV001 UV Personal Toothbrush Sanitizer: It worked well for about two years then died. I am not planning on buying another one although it did work well on trips, just a little bulky.</li>
    <li> After using a different brand for several years, either the bulb burned out or it got too much gunk inside to work.  So I wanted to replace it.  This one has a very narrow space for holding the \\&quot;neck\\&quot; of the toothbrush, unlike the other brand.  I really have to force mine into the space in this one but it does work.  I like that this can be kept in a drawer and doesn&#x27;t have to sit on the bathroom counter like some other styles.</li>
    <li> I thought I would really like this product.  For the first few weeks, it worked great.  Then I noticed the batteries had died.  I put in new batteries and after a few weeks, they died.  So, if you don&#x27;t mind replacing batteries every few weeks, it works fine.  For occasional use, it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem but for everyday use, replacing batteries that often can get expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought this sanitizer on January 4, 2008 and have used it to sanitize my toothbrush daily ever since. It has so far worked as advertised. It Powers on by closing the door and automatically turns off exactly 16 minutes later. My unit has worked flawlessly so far and am yet to experience any problem. How do I know it has been working? The blue light turns on as soon as the door is closed and turns off 16 minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things I have observed: First, the plate where the brush seats has discolored, probably as a result of water from the toothbrush. I usually shake the toothbrush dry before placing it in the sanitizer. I might have dropped the brush in there before drying it completely a few times without realizing it. No big deal since that has not affected it&#x27;s performance in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I have noticed is that it drains regular alkaline batteries in under 3 weeks of daily use. So using the regular alkaline or even cheap brand rechargeable batteries can get costly fast. I have switched to [[ASIN:B004UG41W8 Sanyo NEW 1500 eneloop 4 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries]] and so far I get a little over 4 weeks from it before needing to recharge. Overall this is great product.</li>
    <li> Works well (as far as I can tell as a microbacteria level) but I am not pleased that everytime I pick up my bag, or any movement at all, will turn the sanitizer on.  Drains your battery too fast because of this.</li>
    <li> it broke after 3 months despite of battery change can&#x27;t get it to work</li>
    <li> This product lasted all of about six weeks.  During that time, the batteries were replaced twice.  Finally, the bulb burned out.  Would not recommend this product and surprised that Sunbeam has not done a better job at this technology.  Not a scientist, but also doubt the strength of the UV light.  Seemed weak.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.  You will be wasting your money.</li>
    <li> Whether it actually does what is says, this certainly &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; better for me to have my brush completely enclosed. :)</li>
    <li> I bought it for the trip and I love it and feel safe to be healthier&lt;br /&gt;I recommeded to others</li>
</ol>
