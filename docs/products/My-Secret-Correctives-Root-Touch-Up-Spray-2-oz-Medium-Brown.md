<ol>
    <li> The spray came out clear, with absolutely no color at all.  It wouldn&#x27;t even show up on a white paper towel.  I shook the can for five minutes and still nothing.  I threw it out!</li>
    <li> This product was a total waste of money.  I used it as directed and it did NOT cover the gray and I did purchase the correct shade for my hair color.</li>
    <li> The medium brown is water&lt;br /&gt;when you order 2 they send you 1</li>
    <li> Sprays are too toxic and cause breakage.  You should go to your salon and ask for their version of a &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; or brush on&amp;#34;powdrr&amp;#34;. BC</li>
    <li> Great coverage!  Matched my color well and very easy to use.  Helped me to extend my time between hair appointments!</li>
    <li> I use the product between coloring my hair.  I love that it washes out with each shampoo.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not really impressed with this hair color spray. The one they advertised on TV is much better. Color does not come out unless you keep spraying and spraying. I would much rather go through the touch up of roots than try to cover with this spray.</li>
    <li> I gave this a low rating because I found it messy and hard to use, the spray was very hard and when it did work the color was not what I expected.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  It blends in very well and leaves no texture change in the treated hair.  What I like most is that it is a fine mist aerosol so the spray goes on lightly and you can control how much you need and where you need it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t smell or look fake. It happens to match my hair almost perfectly.  When I spray it lightly it makes my gray hair look like they are highlights.  When I put it on heavier it blends perfectly.  It lasts for 4-5 days if you don&#x27;t wash your hair.</li>
    <li> Works just great until my next color time.</li>
    <li> This works great for grey spots.  I have a few around the hairline and I spritz a little and rub it around with my fingertips to smooth out the color.</li>
    <li> This is no cure all for gray roots, but I think its the best thing I&#x27;ve found. The color is acceptable and the fact that you spray it on rather than paint it on seems to provide somewhat better coverage than other products I&#x27;ve tried. My biggest complaint is that it comes in an irritatingly small container that I can go thru in 3 or 4 days. This stuff should be sold in an economy size hair spray bottle.</li>
    <li> This seemed like a good price, and the sprays work much better than the solid dye sticks. However there is very little dye in the spray. You have to put on several layers to cover even 50% gray hair.  I am not impressed and won&#x27;t be ordering this particular product again. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Vendor was great also.  The light brown product was too light and gave no coverage and didn&#x27;t work for me.  The medium brown was great.</li>
    <li> I spray, but the color diesn&#x27;t seem to adhere.  I&#x27;m not throwing it out, but I ordered another kind of application.</li>
    <li> I have already put it in the trash. It is very sticky. spray the air more than hair. I don&#x27;t recomment to use it.</li>
    <li> There is no color in this bottle.  Nothing but air comes out.  I am working on getting my money back for this.</li>
    <li> My grey grows out FAST. Inbetween colorings, this stuff works great. I just spray it on the roots and it covers my stubborn grey.  Lasts until the next wash. Color blended great.  Very happy with this product and the price was reasonable as well. It&#x27;s a small can but you really don&#x27;t need to use that much especially if you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday.  Would buy again.</li>
