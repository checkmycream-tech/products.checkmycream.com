    <li> My review is for the OPI color: \\&quot;swimsuit..nailed it!\\&quot; Ladies, if you&#x27;re like me &amp; Blue is your fave color, you NEED this in your collection! This is such a GORGEOUS shade of blue..very striking! When i took it with me for my pedicure, the nail tech wanted to keep it for the shop..Lol! He did&#x27;nt want me taking it back home! I laughed &amp; said \\&quot;sorry, but it&#x27;s MINE!\\&quot; This is a metallic looking blue, the glitter in it is VERY fine like a powder..this is what gives it that metallic look. It&#x27;s very unique &amp; you&#x27;ll get compliments on it. It&#x27;s also fast drying &amp; long wearing. The picture does NOT do it justice!</li>
    <li> I think of the ocean every time I look at my nails.  Use a good base coat and good topcoat and you will be thrilled.</li>

    <li> This color is shiny and great!  The best blue I&#x27;ve found - and I always wear blue on my toes.  I had to buy it after trying it at a salon.  I guess they don&#x27;t manufacture it anymore, so get it while it lasts!</li>

    <li> This nail polish really looks great on. The color is true to the bottle. You will need 2 coats.

    <li> Great color. Love It!</li>
    <li> This blue is really, really bright. I wore it one day and could not stop staring at my nails. If you want a color that stands out this is the color for you!! To be honest this was a little too bright for me. At the time I was wearing it I was wearing my nails pretty long. I think it might look better with a little shorter nails. That being said I do really like this color. If you like to wear bright colors I would definitely recommend it for you!!</li>
    <li> I wanted a polish in T.A.R.D.I.S. blue (Doctor Who), and this one is perfect. I can always depend on OPI to make a good product.</li>
