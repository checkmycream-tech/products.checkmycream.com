<li> I like the fact that you can purchase Retinol in different strengths.... if your skin is sensitive to on strength just go down...</li>
<li> It is too expensive for the amount you receive,but, I would rather pay for one thing I love than 10 things I won&#x27;t use...much less recommend.</li>
<li> the tube lasts for a long time!</li>
<li> You use a very small amount: a pea size for the whole face and neck..</li>
<li> A tube lasts a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why since I have been using retinal .01 for a long time ( different brand )  </li>
<li> I use it every other night.</li>
<li> Also lightens dark spots &amp; repairs sun damage.</li>
<li> It has a slight tint-like stain that takes away any sallow appearance you might have.</li>
<li> Stop using all that harsh, abrasive stuff with Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
<li> Read the review&#x27;s so was anxious to try.</li>
<li> I think my wrinkles have decreased and it is less harsh then retrinal alone.</li>
<li> Expensive but prompt shipping &amp; no problems!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Read the review&#x27;s so was anxious to try. Did not notice much improvement the first month but continued to use. Really noticed a difference after second month. Been using for 5 months and wouldn&#x27;t be without it! I am 56 and almost all my wrinkles are gone! I have tried many products and this is the first one to make a difference!</li>
    <li> Works great on stubborn Acne. Use this and Cetaphil &amp;#34;Gentle&amp;#34; cleanser. Stop using all that harsh, abrasive stuff with Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
    <li> My wife and I purchased this book and others as a gift for our Grandson. We have never heard back from him and probably won&#x27;t. Not even a thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for severalo weeks, and even at my advanced age, I can see some differences in the texture and lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is awesome  retrinal cream 0.1% i have been using stri vectin  for years and it does not compare with this product. I do not like the firming get in this product line, tooooooo much money for no results.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that you can purchase Retinol in different strengths.... if your skin is sensitive to on strength just go down...</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and continue to be thoroughly satisfied with it.  I feel that it greatly reduces wrinkles without causing irritated skin. I would recommended to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 62 and much improved after using this great product.  The lines seem to lessen especially under my eyes and I&#x27;m told my skin looks wonderful.  Great product and very reasonable compared to the dermatologist&#x27;s prices.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product!  It was recommended to me by an aesthetician who is French and has the most gorgeous skin.  Just use a pea sized amount on your face morning and night.  Your skin will be so smooth, will glow and look years younger.  I know I sound like a commercial, but I&#x27;m a very happy consumer.  I&#x27;m 56 years old and people comment on my complextion all the time.  VERY highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 2 years and really think it has made a difference. I look like I have not aged as much.   It is a great product-I wish I would have started using it before I was in my 50s.  I recommend you get started on it!!!</li>
    <li> This Avene Retinal 0.1 o/o Cream, for better skin has been great for my sisters and I wanted the same skin  improvement.  I loved the price I got at Amazon, which is 1/3 of what they had paid at a spa adjacent to  a dermatologist. I have began to a nice change, already !</li>
    <li> I started noticing results within a week. My sun spots have lightened, my pores look smaller, and my fine lines have been greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;I can just wear powder instead of foundation now because of my skin looks and feels so great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and absolutely love it. It helps to reduce fine lines around my eyes it also helps for those breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have used this product pretty consistently for the past five plus years. I use it every other night. My skin is in very good shape for 54 years old. I have minimal wrinkling and am very happy with my skin! It is very smooth and the pores are minimized. You use a very small amount: a pea size for the whole face and neck..the tube lasts for a long time!</li>
    <li> I was hoping to see improvement in my skin after one month&#x27;s usage, but so far nothing looks better -- same facial lines and dark spots.  Also, the cream made my skin peel, which I hope is exfoliation for improvement. My dermatologist said if I don&#x27;t see improvement within several months, he will prescribe another cream. I&#x27;m still keeping my fingers crossed for positive results.</li>
    <li> I had a Vibraderm Facial before I began using this cream. It seems to enhance what I had done and makes my skin glow. It has a slight tint-like stain that takes away any sallow appearance you might have. My only issue is the cost! It is too expensive for the amount you receive,but, I would rather pay for one thing I love than 10 things I won&#x27;t use...much less recommend.</li>
    <li> Have used this produce for 2 years and have had very good results. Was recommended by my dermatologist for age/sun spots and lines. My skin has become smoother and softer. Buying on Amazon vs the dermatologist saved me $15.00.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product was a colossal waste of my money.  I do not recommend this product.  I&#x27;m going back to using SkinCeuticals Retinol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why since I have been using retinal .01 for a long time ( different brand )  But this one makes me itchy. But seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother and she loves it. She used to buy it a dermatologist&#x27;s office for much more.</li>
    <li> I am happy to report that this product works!  It really does. I started using it faithfully every night and after about two weeks I could see a difference in my skin. What an improvement.  I had fewer lines, better skin tone, and just an overall more youthful look...</li>
    <li> I had a LPL facial (light treatment) from which my doctor explained skin care and products. She highly recommended this, so like a good shopper I came to Amazon to find the best deal. I finally purchased this and find that it is a good retinal cream. I have not noticed any yellow stains on my pillow (read in another review) and I wash my face and put this on at night before bed. I would suggest this to anyone wanting to find a good retinal cream.</li>
    <li> This product is a great way to get some vitamin A retinoid without the expense of having to pay a dermatologist. It&#x27;s retrinal, not retinoic acid, but the 0.1% makes up for that.</li>
    <li> This is the only skin care product that I can truly say made a huge difference in my skin. It takes about a month to notice the effects, but you have to keep using it or your skin goes back to the way it was. It smoothes wrinkles &amp; crepiness &amp; gives a sheen to your skin that makes it look much younger. Also lightens dark spots &amp; repairs sun damage. Be sure to use a sunscreen because it makes your skin photosensitive, but way worth it for me. A tube lasts a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> loved it, i use this product all the time. amazon had a super price for it., i ordered&lt;br /&gt;two tubes, so if i run out i will reorder again, hope the price will be the same.</li>
    <li> I have been using avene for years and I love the way it makes my skin look.  I think my wrinkles have decreased and it is less harsh then retrinal alone.</li>
    <li> Expensive but prompt shipping &amp; no problems! Kept me informed of progress. I am satisfied all aspects of the purchase.with theWhat more can you ask?</li>
