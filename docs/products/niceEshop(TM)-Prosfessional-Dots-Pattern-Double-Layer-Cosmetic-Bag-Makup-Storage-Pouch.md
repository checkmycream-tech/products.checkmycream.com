    <li> Much smaller than I though it would be but other than that it is fine, and fun colors :) So far seems like good quality.</li>
    <li> much smaller than i expected</li>
    <li> This is perfect! I have a big caboodle, and it&#x27;s hard to travel with. This is perfect to fit in my suitcase! I love that it has 2 compartments, and a section for the brushes.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>

    <li> Good item good price . Works for our needs</li>
    <li> It is much smaller that the pictures lead you to believe.  Always make sure to read the measurements in the descriptions.  My wife still uses it daily for her essentials, but only because her nicer one started to fall apart.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product, just small.  Would probably be perfect as a toiletry bag or for a little girl just starting on makeup however.</li>

    <li> This is such a cute bag.  I put most of my high end designer makeup in it, and it&#x27;s been my constant companion. The zipper has been tried and tested constantly, and I have no complaints about it.  The color is amazing, and the bonus mirror on the inside is cute.</li>

    <li> It came from China but came very quickly! Due to packaging it&#x27;s mashed down but I stuffed with socks for about a week then filled with makeup and it&#x27;s perfect. Satiney finish, nice pockets for brushes, and 2 separate layers with their own zippers. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price!
