<ol>
    <li> Great item, great price, great shipping from a great dealer. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, function and colors!</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed that I only received one bottle. I assumed from the picture that I would receive three bottles. The price is too steep for one sub-par bottle.</li>
    <li> the product is great, but this is deceiving, i thought i was getting 3, i only received one!</li>
    <li> Beware of Seller: One spray bottle comes with the order -- NOT 3 like the picture shows</li>
    <li> The picture indicates that you will receive 3 bottles.  I kept looking through my box for the other 2 bottles. There was only 1.  I think this picture is misleading and false.  I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Did not read whole description . Thought I was getting 3 bottles</li>
    <li> Deceiving product. I was under the assumption that it was a three pack. Only one spray bottle is included.</li>
    <li> Even if you have 3 colors, WHY show a picture with 3 bottles? Deceptive. Item received was dented. Let&#x27;s hope it sprays</li>
    <li> This was only one bottle not the 3 in the picture, it was misleading and I was expecting 3 for the price.  I dont think I would have bought for the price if I know it was only one.  But I bought as part of a christmas present so it didnt get returned.</li>
    <li> ITS REALLY NOT A GOOD BOTTLE, WHEN I SPRAY THE BOTTLE SUCKS IN AND NOW ITS USELESS</li>
    <li> It has been working very well.  The plastic could be a bit thicker as it did get dented on the side of the bottle.  My daughter uses it everyday and loves the &amp;#34;jeweled&amp;#34; look!</li>
    <li> Received one bottle, and plastic is of poor quality and bottle dented in two places. Also picture of three bottles is misleading.</li>
    <li> Picture is misleading.  There is only one bottle, and you can&#x27;t choose the color.  This needs to be made clear in the product description - please fix!</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed. It shows 3 pictures of the bottles, seemed like you were getting 3 bottles 3 different colors and you only get 1! Very upsetting.</li>
    <li> The water bottle plastic was crushed/dented at the bottom. I needed to use a butter knife to pop it back out. It still has a smaller dent that will not pop out. This is very disappointing considering it is a NEW product.</li>
    <li> Thank you, bottles as described.  Look pretty and they work!  I can adjust the spray nozzle for&lt;br /&gt;amount of spray needed at the time of use and shut spray off completely for storage.</li>
    <li> Picture is very misleading, especially when you receive a bottle that could have easily been bought for a dollar somewhere else!  Wish I would have read the reviews before ordering....</li>
    <li> I would never had purchased this if I had know it was one bottle not a set of three bottles. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t Spray- Had to return it unfortunately :(</li>
    <li> As someone else has said, the picture is very misleading. It appears to indicate that the order will contain 3 bottles. THERE IS ONLY ONE IN THE ORDER!. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> perfect little water bottles for unruly kitties...one spritz and they stop the &amp;#34;naughty behavior&amp;#34; so they learn very quickly to not do what they are doing without my needing to say a word or even usually get out of my chair!</li>
    <li> just what I expected 5 stars</li>
    <li> This spray bottle only successfully shot the water out once and now every time I pull the trigger, the liquid travels halfway up the straw and then stops.  The one time it did eject the water, it shot out in a stream instead of a typical &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34;. Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Be awre: the picture shows 3 bottles, but there is only one in the package.</li>
    <li> inexpensive bottles but they do the trick!</li>
    <li> False advertising! My fault for not checking more carefully, but Amazon should either pull this product or force seller to change photo to reflect ONE spray bottle. $5.65 for one flimsy plastic spray bottle is outrageous!</li>
    <li> good to use anything you want to put in the bottle</li>
    <li> could shoot a lil harder but i bought them to train my animals to NOT do stuff so i think theyd be perf3ect for stylin!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t spray the way i expected it shoots straight instead of like a mist. All the liquids drips all over i will be looking for a better spray bottle in the future.</li>
