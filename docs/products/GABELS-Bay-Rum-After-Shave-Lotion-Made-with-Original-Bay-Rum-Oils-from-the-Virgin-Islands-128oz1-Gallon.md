      <li>good quality original product (sold by MD Barber Supply.)  </li>

      <li>Great product with incredibly fast shipping!</li>
      <li>The price was almost too good to be true.  </li>
      <li>I found this on Amazon.com and was surprised to get a 128Oz jug for a very good price.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not only a wonderful non intrusive all purpose , all body , manly after shave -&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>

      <li>I make sure to use it every day and my skin feels better since I&#x27;ve been doing that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>By comparison the scent from Gabels Bay Rum is more defined and lasts a lot longer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even though the shipping price to Alaska was more than the purchase price of one gallon from Gabels (we are accustomed to additional shipping costs)</li>
      <li>Not as potent as the $ stuff, but sufficient for the likes of  me.</li>
      <li>Most store sales staff will refer you to a Liquer Store .&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
      <li>chemical is safe.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Safety is good, but be aware that the sucrose octaacetate does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>It keeps your face fresh and smooth and it smell good too.</li>
      <li>and I really liked the fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Good for sharing with the whole neighborhood.</li>
      <li>This after shave has a nice, clean Bay Rum smell that is not too sweet or overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased I buy other products from Amazon.com ( books) and have had good results.</li>
      <li>Cost of a gallon more than met my expectations and made the volume worth paying for.</li>
      <li>Welcome back to 1965!</li>
      <li>Glad I was able to find it again after having not been able to find it for locally for years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as DEET and won&#x27;t repel deerflies, but it repels mosquitoes just fine and doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you&#x27;re covered with bear grease on a sizzling summer day.</li>
      <li>Feels and smells great and not much sting.  </li>
      <li>purchase contains a bright yellow liquid, not the amber color in the picture.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells good and will only keep Insects At Bay.</li>
      <li>The 1 gallon size comes in a reasonable price and sems to be very cost effective.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly!!!</li>
      <li>the numbers still rang out as an excellent value costing less than what I had purchased direct from the distributor in Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
      <li>Today when someone asks about the fragrance I give them a small bottle filled with with the clean scent of Bay rum and great memories of a much missed uncle.    </li>
      <li>Hey, this stuff is the best kept secret in America.</li>
      <li>- you have a gallon&#x27;s worth after</li>
      <li>I loved the idea of buying a gallon at such a reasonable price and took a chance.</li>
      <li>This product is a great bay rum, with the smell of the product used by barbers in years past.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It really works!</li>
      <li>By purchasing a gallon at a time, I will save many dollars over several years on aftershave lotion.</li>
      <li>I first discovered Gabels at Donnie Halley&#x27;s Halleywood Barber Shop in Costa Mesa, California.</li>
      <li>First started using bay rum as a kid at barber shops.</li>
      <li>Use to be able to get this product from Sally&#x27;s now they only carry 16 oz.</li>
      <li>Today is the first day I&#x27;ve used the Bay Rum from Gabels.  </li>
      <li>Smells good, its strong when first applying it but fades fast and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a scent.</li>
      <li>I think you&#x27;ll like it; I really do.</li>
      <li>Since I had so much, I&#x27;ve bottled up a couple of samples for friends.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the feeling.</li>
      <li>Whenever I splash on Gabels Bay Rum I enjoy the compliments from not only my wife but from friends as well.  </li>
      <li>At under 40 dollars per gallon, this is a real bargain.  </li>
      <li>It will take me almost two years to use the whole one</li>
      <li>As an adult, I bought it in tiny bottles that cost more than this jug.</li>
      <li>A manly classic scent and not the perfumed junk that kids wear now.  </li>
      <li>It is very cooling and pleasant to use, it has a great, subtle smell and is not heavily-scented with cloves, cinnamon, citrus, or any of the other &amp;#34;additives&amp;#34; that other commercial Bay Rum products promote.</li>
      <li>Kind of hard to find in the gallon bottles now.</li>
      <li>bought a gallon&#x27;s worth for $35.00 total delivered with Prime.</li>
      <li>Now that I live in Portland, Oregon, Gabels reminds me of that shop and my father.</li>
      <li>AND THE CLUBMAN AND OTHER COLOGNES FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>only improvement could be the color it looks too much like urine</li>
      <li>A Gallon seems like a big gamble for first-timers, but at this price, you really can&#x27;t lose.</li>
      <li>You ain&#x27;t gonna get all that with Old Spice.</li>
      <li>The product is good quality, and is enough to last me a life time or until my wife gets tired of it and tosses it.</li>
      <li>Considering the price difference between a smaller bottle and the gallon, spring for the bigger bottle (a real deal).  </li>
      <li>all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion to the manufacturer would be to add a slight dye to the formula to make it look more dark amber.&lt;br</li>

    <li> good quality original product (sold by MD Barber Supply.)  my wife love it, a must have for Jamaican family, as it works and do helps... will buy again...</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. By purchasing a gallon at a time, I will save many dollars over several years on aftershave lotion. &lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a place to buy the gallon size Gabel&#x27;s for some time now.  &lt;br /&gt;So convenient for Amazon to have it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> GABELS Bay Rum is one excellent after shave with quality superior to other well known brands.  It keeps your face fresh and smooth and it smell good too.</li>
    <li> I had an uncle Matt, everyone needs a person in their life like my uncle Matt.  He always had a fresh scent coupled with a good nature.  As uncles go he was perfect with a bit of mischief on the side.  Gabels was his after shave and he purchased it from his barber in 16oz bottles.  Whenever I splash on Gabels Bay Rum I enjoy the compliments from not only my wife but from friends as well.  Today when someone asks about the fragrance I give them a small bottle filled with with the clean scent of Bay rum and great memories of a much missed uncle.    PS.  I bought the Gallon size.    Gregg</li>
    <li> The product is good quality, and is enough to last me a life time or until my wife gets tired of it and tosses it. Ha,Ha&lt;br /&gt;I may even give small containers of it away at Christmas.</li>
    <li> A Navy 22 year Veteran, I used Bay rum as aftershave. After retiring it was hard to find Bay Rum afteshave in the original form. I found it but it was just bayrum  with alot of alcohol content and at a poor price.I found this on Amazon.com and was surprised to get a 128Oz jug for a very good price. And delivery from  California to Virginia was good. Very pleased I buy other products from Amazon.com ( books) and have had good results. George</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Bay Rum. It is what it is. A great After-Shave Lotion at a great price! The one Gallon size is definitely the way to go! Glad I was able to find it again after having not been able to find it for locally for years. I recommend it highly!!!</li>
    <li> This is a awesome product. Kind of hard to find in the gallon bottles now.Use to be able to get this product from Sally&#x27;s now they only carry 16 oz. bottles.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of Bay Rum, a scent my father preferred when I was a boy. The only one that takes me back each time I use it, is Gabels. I first discovered Gabels at Donnie Halley&#x27;s Halleywood Barber Shop in Costa Mesa, California. It&#x27;s a completely retro barber shop with a big sign, \\&quot;Gentlemen Only.\\&quot; He finishes every straight-razor shave or haircut with Gabels. Now that I live in Portland, Oregon, Gabels reminds me of that shop and my father. You ain&#x27;t gonna get all that with Old Spice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the gallon size I like the most. Never have to shop around for after shave fore a long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased a case of 8 oz bottles of Bay Rum direct from a Dominica Bay Rum distributor in Florida several years ago.  I was very satisfied with the product I received.  It finally ran out.  Searching Amazon I found Gabels Bay Rum in a one gallon container.  The price was almost too good to be true.  Even though the shipping price to Alaska was more than the purchase price of one gallon from Gabels (we are accustomed to additional shipping costs) the numbers still rang out as an excellent value costing less than what I had purchased direct from the distributor in Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the pleasant surprise.  Today is the first day I&#x27;ve used the Bay Rum from Gabels.  The Bay Rum I purchased from Gabels had the same scent as the Bay Rum from the Florida distributor but with less alcohol smell.  By comparison the scent from Gabels Bay Rum is more defined and lasts a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally avoid writing product reviews but the quality of Gabels Bay Rum impressed me.</li>
    <li> You try and get BAY RUM  !!!  Most store sales staff will refer you to a Liquer Store .&lt;br /&gt;Some Oldtimers will warn you not to drink the stuff .&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not only a wonderful non intrusive all purpose , all body , manly after shave -&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and will only keep Insects At Bay.</li>
    <li> At under 40 dollars per gallon, this is a real bargain.  The bay scent is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;The one ingredient that might raise a few eyebrows is Sucrose octaacetate.  It is often found in pesticites.  What???&lt;br /&gt;The chemical is safe.  It is added to products to give them a bad taste.  That way, a child would be less likely to drink it after tasting it.&lt;br /&gt;Safety is good, but be aware that the sucrose octaacetate does what it is supposed to do.  The smell of this aftershave is very pleasing, but oh, that taste!&lt;br /&gt;I apply after shaving and again after a few hours when the scent has faded away, but I take care not to get it on my lips to avoid tasting traces of it.&lt;br /&gt;If I live long enough to use up the entire gallon, I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Good deal. Pleanty to splash on after a shower. Not as potent as the $ stuff, but sufficient for the likes of  me. A great value re: quantity.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Gabels Bay Rum has good smell and has a good quality as aftershave. The 1 gallon size comes in a reasonable price and sems to be very cost effective.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews on this product.  I took a gamble on ordering a full gallon and have not been disappointed.  This after shave has a nice, clean Bay Rum smell that is not too sweet or overpowering.  Since the gallon bottle is too heavy to hold steady, fill up a spray bottle, spray it on your hands then apply lotion to your face.  Considering the price difference between a smaller bottle and the gallon, spring for the bigger bottle (a real deal).  I think you&#x27;ll like it; I really do.</li>
    <li> First started using bay rum as a kid at barber shops. As an adult, I bought it in tiny bottles that cost more than this jug. Was a little skeptical but ordered anyway after reading the reviews. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I was a Master-Well-Comb Bay Rum user until Sally Beauty Supply abruptly stopped selling it here in Vermont,&lt;br /&gt;and in the Daytona Beach area of Florida. I was accustomed to that product and was left with no other choices locally.&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side: my wife doesn&#x27;t have to run in to Sally&#x27;s for me anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Gabels Bay Rum on this website, and based on reviews here and at Badger and Blade –&lt;br /&gt;I bought a gallon&#x27;s worth for $35.00 total delivered with Prime. While I prefer the one prior - I do think that Gabels&lt;br /&gt;is a nice product with a great price. It would have cost me roughly $88.00+ for a gallon of the Masters Bay Rum&lt;br /&gt;(based on eight 16oz bottles) from Sally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Masters product smelled a little stronger to me, making the Gabels seem diluted to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Still it&#x27;s refreshing after a shave, although lately I&#x27;ve been unfaithful using Aqua Velva.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that I could buy that product by the gallon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus when buying Gabels by the gallon is the mosquito repellent qualities that this product possesses.&lt;br /&gt;Simply fill a spray bottle with Gabels, and you can avoid trans-dermal absorption of harmful pesticides like &amp;#34;Off&amp;#34;,&lt;br /&gt;and smell good while you&#x27;re at it.&lt;br /&gt;It really works! Spray it on liberally - you have a gallon&#x27;s worth after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion to the manufacturer would be to add a slight dye to the formula to make it look more dark amber.&lt;br /&gt;My purchase contains a bright yellow liquid, not the amber color in the picture. No big deal......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great deal for retro shavers like us. I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent and doesn&#x27;t promote itchy scratchy rash.  I love this stuff and will be ordering more when my gallon runs out.</li>
    <li> The quality of the product and the speed of delivery were both excellent! Cost of a gallon more than met my expectations and made the volume worth paying for.</li>
    <li> Smells the way barbershop Bay Rum should. Bought this to break a male dog from voiding on everything in our garage. It worked. Poured off 8 oz. for my husband to use. He likes it, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped it would.</li>
    <li> I bought this knowing it would last quite awhile.  Smells great, my wife loves it.  A manly classic scent and not the perfumed junk that kids wear now.  I found a travel size spray bottle at the local grocer&#x27;s and thus far I have gone through only half the spray bottle in three weeks.  It will take me almost two years to use the whole one gallon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, a great deal.</li>
    <li> Smells good, its strong when first applying it but fades fast and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a scent.</li>
    <li> This product is a great bay rum, with the smell of the product used by barbers in years past.  It is an excellent aftershave product, which fades to a pleasant background scent that lasts for hours.  The gallon size is by far the best bargain in the offerings, but be prepared for &amp;#34;shipping charge shock&amp;#34; because of the weight of the product.  For me, this added just under $14 to the cost of the product...</li>
    <li> only improvement could be the color it looks too much like urine</li>
    <li> The scent is very nice, and not overpowering. I don&#x27;t shave every day, so this gallon jar might last me 4-5 life times. Good for sharing with the whole neighborhood.</li>
    <li> This bay rum product is great and just what I wanted.  Feels and smells great and not much sting.  I make sure to use it every day and my skin feels better since I&#x27;ve been doing that.</li>
    <li> This is great aftershave at a great price. My dad used to use it 50 years ago. Every time I splash It on after a shave it brings me back 50 years. Thanks for the feeling. Great quality product, great price free shipping what is not to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darian Paganelli</li>
    <li> Hey, this stuff is the best kept secret in America. Even the NSA hasn&#x27;t caught wind of this yet! Gables Bay Rum is the essence of &amp;#34;old-time&amp;#34; bay rum aftershave. Welcome back to 1965! It is very cooling and pleasant to use, it has a great, subtle smell and is not heavily-scented with cloves, cinnamon, citrus, or any of the other &amp;#34;additives&amp;#34; that other commercial Bay Rum products promote. Just a bracing, spicy scent that feels great after SHAVING! Yes, Gabels is an AFTER-SHAVE product, NOT a Cologne! If you&#x27;re looking for something that people will smell from across the room, you&#x27;re fishing in the wrong stream here, but if you are looking for a clean, (not oily-feeling), basic after shave, this is it!  A Gallon seems like a big gamble for first-timers, but at this price, you really can&#x27;t lose. And if you love this stuff as so many have over the years, you&#x27;ll feel like you just hit the lottery!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Does the job, wonderful scent and economical when you purchase the gallon size.</li>
    <li> Three generations ago thrifty folks used Bay Rum as the original &amp;#34;skin-tastic&amp;#34; insect repellent. It&#x27;s not as powerful as DEET and won&#x27;t repel deerflies, but it repels mosquitoes just fine and doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you&#x27;re covered with bear grease on a sizzling summer day. Once the SD alcohol evaporates the residue is an almost imperceptible film of oil that mosquitoes don&#x27;t like. Doesn&#x27;t interfere at all with perspiration (your body&#x27;s &amp;#34;air conditioning&amp;#34;), gives skin a silky texture, smells nicer than any repellent packaged as such. Delightful. Today it&#x27;s still a cheapskate&#x27;s delight because at this price per volume (8 oz for $2.22) it&#x27;s the cheapest repellent you can get. I put it in a chem-resistant pump sprayer. In NYC you can find small bottles crazy cheap (Puerto Ricans and Dominicans use it) but anywhere else this gallon of Gabel&#x27;s is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Great product with incredibly fast shipping! You made my day. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I ORDERED GABELS 16 OZ BAY RUM AFTER SHAVE LOTION ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER COMPANIES THAT OFFERED BAY RUM AFTERSHAVE. I DECIDED I LIKED GABELS AND CLUBMAN&#x27;S VIRGIN ISLAND BAY RUM&#x27;S SMELL THE BEST (I AM NO EXPERT ON BAY RUM AND ONLY RECENTLY DISCOVERED SAFETY RAZOR SHAVING AND WANTED THAT OLD SCHOOL BARBER SHOP FEEL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DECIDED TO ORDER THE GABELS 1 GALLON CONTAINER (FOR EVERYDAY USE AND THE CLUBMAN AND OTHER COLOGNES FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WILL DEFINITELY DO BUSINESS WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE.</li>
    <li> Years ago my ex gave me a bottle of bay rum aftershave for fathers day(?) and I really liked the fresh scent. Long story short, I&#x27;ve re-visited some of my old shaving &#x27;ways&#x27; and happened across this highly recommended bay rum aftershave. I loved the idea of buying a gallon at such a reasonable price and took a chance. Spot on! This has a very nice scent that lasts the day but doesn&#x27;t seem too strong or intrusive. Just started wearing it so the only comment I&#x27;ve gotten was from our admin who likes it. Since I had so much, I&#x27;ve bottled up a couple of samples for friends. I recommend this product for both the scent and the price. Great deal IMHO.</li>
