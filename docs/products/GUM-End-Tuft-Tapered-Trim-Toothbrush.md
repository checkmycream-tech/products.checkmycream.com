    <li> this is a great  toothbrush. doses a great job get good reports. will buy agan. gum is the best will use all the time.</li>
    <li> The brush head on one of the toothbrushes had black bristles, yuck. Had to return. Was very satisfied with Amazon&#x27;s return handling.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and it was delivered the next day.</li>
    <li> Works really well roll get the back molars. Takes some getting used to, but hoping I&#x27;m get positive feedback from my dentist.</li>
    <li> Being prone to plaque, my dentist suggested I try something like this brush.  Post brushing, I run this brush along my gum line several times.  It cleans any missed plaque and it stimulates the gums.  The brushes are study, good handy and I find them easy to grip and use.</li>
    <li> These brushes are excellent in controlling and preventing periodontal disease.  The tuft reaches below the gum line to remove debris that causes inflammation resulting in perio disease.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> My mice have never had nicer smiles!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my father-in-law because he can&#x27;t find it in Hawaii.  Says it an excellent product, will be ordering more for him later.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite brushes and not available in any stores in my area. I like the fact that they are not ultra soft as I like to use it to scrub behind my front teeth which are curved so a regular toothbrush misses it. It&#x27;s excellent for getting around the gums between the teeth and all the way behind the molars. I&#x27;m careful to brush gently around the gums. I use this in addition to an electric brush.</li>
    <li> Ahead of schedule and in good shape!  Product was recommended by my dentist and I look forward to using it.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, great product.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find, so I am very happy to find them here. They are good and work well.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I have a small jaw and struggle to clean behind my back teeth. My dental hygienist gave me one of these to try, and now I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> Great product at good price -- these are hard to find in the drugstores and are so good for hard to reach teeth (or with braces).</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Arrived sooner then expected.</li>
    <li> does what it is supposed to do</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mother and she loves them!</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush to get inbetween my teeth where my other brush doesn&#x27;t go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for years. Used to get them free from my dentist. Unable to find them in stores.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t check it out with my dentist yet, but it works amazing.. great for cleaning better than floss it seems like.. or in addition to floss..  I&#x27;ll report back after I see my dentist and get the scoop on what she thinks as well.  Was highly recommended by a friend and his dentist.</li>
    <li> Good brush for getting at tight spaces. The bristles are relatively soft.</li>
    <li> I have used this handy size bush in the past for pottery detail work.&lt;br /&gt;Very effective for that ...I&#x27;m sure it works wonders on gums also.</li>
    <li> I have a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth and this type of toothbrush is a must-have to get into those hard to reach spots between the wires.  This works perfectly and also gets into difficult spots like behind your molars and in between your teeth (of course don&#x27;t forget to floss!)  I cannot find these end-tuft toothbrushes in the grocery store or drug stores so it is great that they can be purchased online.</li>
    <li> easily takes care of those hard-to-reach places</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended these end tuft brushes for my back molars and I noticed a different fill the first time I used one. I will definitely continue to use them.</li>
