      <li>My kids love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Since you need to replace your toothbrush often we were not terribly upset</li>
      <li>The head of the brush wore out real quick.</li>
      <li>We have found that alkaline batteries seem to work better than the rechargeable ones.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why kids like the spinning brushes better but what ever gets them to brush their teeth more.</li>
      <li>She enjoyed decorating it and enjoys using it.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for her smaller mouth.</li>
      <li>These are cute toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>And I love the sticker decorations.</li>
      <li>We will be buying more of these.</li>
      <li>(the top part of the toothbrush that enters the mouth).  </li>
      <li>&amp; I like the fact that she is keeping it in her mouth longer &amp; covering more area.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>and they love it.</li>
      <li>With most things these days, invest in rechargeable batteries, problem solved.</li>
      <li>works pretty good.</li>
      <li>Dentist visit one month later was successful!</li>
      <li>great for the young lady!</li>
      <li>She did enjoy putting her name on her toothbrush, and being able to decorate it herself.</li>
      <li>I thought it was a really cute and fun way to get her interested in having good dental hygiene.  </li>
      <li>I like the way it is easy to turn on and off.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush works fine</li>
      <li>The best part is the on/off switch, it is easy for little fingers and stays on.</li>
      <li>If you need a precision screwdriver set, I got a cheap one that has tons of heads and works great for tiny putzy toy battery covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Each time we get these they enjoy decorating them to personalize.  </li>
      <li>The spinning part made it way more fun to brush her teeth.</li>
      <li>The brush is easy to use and seems to clean our five year olds teeth well.  </li>
      <li>This fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: Good spin action, two levels of bristles for finer cleaning, and stickers for your kid to decorate the toothbrush.</li>
      <li>My 5 and 3 year old granddaughters just loved this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I received this product at a highly discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>She loved decorating it and the movement of the head is too ruff against her baby teeth and strong enough to keep them clean.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean and fun for her to use until we upgraded her to a Sonic Care electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Very cool to decorate, and worked great for about 6 months, but changing batteries was a huge pain and now its dead 6 months after purchase.</li>
      <li>So, I guess if you buy it with fresh batteries and plan on it being disposable after one use, it would be fine.  </li>
      <li>and it is soooo cool that it has her name on it</li>
      <li>She loved decorating it and putting her name on it with the letter stickers, and she loves to brush her teeth like a big girl along side her brothers!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really found a better alternative yet.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The stickers are cool.</li>
      <li>A cute gift for a toddler who wants to emulate her mom dad and sister.</li>
      <li>It is my favorite tooth brush i have ever got in my whole life.</li>
      <li>the kids loved putting stickers on, that is a big plus.</li>
      <li>I love it so much i bring it every where.</li>
      <li>Certainly made brushing teeth much more fun for my niece.</li>
      <li>The batteries die quickly.</li>
      <li>and i love my new toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>My daughter had a TON of fun placing the stickers in the body of the toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I am getting a different brand that I can change the head and get my own stickers.</li>
      <li>That was the only nice part.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive a Spinbrush with stickers like pictured. The brushes I received have a Wild Bandz decoration instead. My girls like the brush with stickers so I returned these brushes back to the distributor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery Life:  if you are brushing a toddler&#x27;s mouth the battery will probably last 3 months. If your daughter is brushes her own teeth and she bites the bristles a lot, or uses a lot of force when brushing, it will last about a month before the batteries will wear out.  You have to have a micro-screwdriver to open the casing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have three kids, and in 12 years, none of them have ever had a cavity, thanks to these Spinbrushes.</li>
    <li> Works great until the battery dies. The screw holding the battery chamber closed is so small that I have not found a screwdriver to fit. I just keep buying new ones.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works fine but, so far I have not been able to open the battery door when the battery died.  I have bought two of these, thinking that maybe the first one was an anomaly.  However, the second one won&#x27;t unscrew either.  I am not going to risk it again so the second was the last purchase. I recommend trying any other spinbrush for a child.  This one is not worth it.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old loves this. The spinning part made it way more fun to brush her teeth. She even loved the stickers. She could add her name and lots of color. She asked to brush her teeth extra times for days after receiving.</li>
    <li> Loved to decorate and make it your own.  The only problem is that the circular part spins but the rectangular part does not move.</li>
    <li> the kids loved putting stickers on, that is a big plus. When you click the switch it stays on, another plus. The switch is big so it is easier to push, but my four year old has trouble with it sometimes. all in all it is a little loud and the switch can be difficult, but it is a great brush for my girls and they love it.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the quality of this toothbrush, especially considering the price.  My daughter loved all the stickers and it comes with so many.  Very cute.  I haven&#x27;t reached the point where we need to replace the battery yet, but for the price of this toothbrush, I&#x27;m very happy with it..</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 6yr old daughter and she LOVES it!!! It&#x27;s no longer a struggle getting her to brush, since she now has a one-of-a-kind creation to polish her pearly whites! You can get the whole set, that includes the brush, stickers, matching cup and brush holder online at [...] as well!!</li>
    <li> I bought one for my daughter. The best part is the on/off switch, it is easy for little fingers and stays on. My 10 year old daughter just finished decorating hers. Let&#x27;s see if she brushes a little better with a pretty toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Our daughter loves this toothbrush! She can&#x27;t wait to brush her teeth every morning and night. The stickers are a great way for children to express themselves, while practicing healthy habits:)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that I can&#x27;t replace the heads and that the last one I bought quit working (even after a battery change) pretty quickly, but that said I did buy this again. I haven&#x27;t really found a better alternative yet.</li>
    <li> My daughter had a TON of fun placing the stickers in the body of the toothbrush. She was so happy that she&#x27;s wanted to brush her teeth several times a day, seriously! This is just a great product and a brilliant idea to let the kids decorate it.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that my daughter can create her own toothbrush.  There are plenty of stickers to use elsewhere, and there is enough variety to suit any personality.</li>
    <li> Well, the battery outlasted her interest but for a week of no arguing over teeth brushing it was worth every penny. Might be just the fun needed to help make teeth brushing less of a battle at your house! Her favorite part was putting on the stickers!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve gone through two of these already.  The first one lasted for a couple of months and then the battery died and the screw you have to undo to get to the battery chamber is so tiny that I ruined it before I could get the chamber open.  So I bought my daughter another one instead.  The second one&#x27;s battery died within the first 30 days.  Extremely disappointing.  We don&#x27;t have the micro-screwdriver needed to try to open the chamber and from what I read in a previous review, it&#x27;s probably not worth the effort to go out and buy a micro-screwdriver.  I&#x27;ve given up, will buy a different electric toothbrush this time.  We&#x27;ve had several different electric toothbrushes picked up at Target - Hello Kitty, Wall-E, Cars - and each of those seem to last forever, at least until the kids get tired of them or the bristles grind down.  But this Spinbrush is or mediocre quality.  My daughter does however love decorating it, lasting only a few weeks though, it&#x27;s not worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Cute design but stopped spinning after one use!</li>
    <li> not very powerful, rather use rechargeable toothbrush</li>
    <li> Love the toothbrush BUT recommend watching for mildew growth in the holes on the back of this toothbrush (the top part of the toothbrush that enters the mouth).  I purchased one for each of my children and in less than a couple of months (the American Dental Association recommends changing toothbrushes every 3-4 months) there was mildew growth.  I noticed dark holes and attempted to scrub the holes, rinse, and tap it on the edge of the sink and was so horrified by the amount of mildew/black mold that came out that I quickly tossed them.  If you have this toothbrush, take the time to check the holes on the back of the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my daughter use this toothbrush for about a month so far, and it is okay. We bought ours at the local Walgreens for about the same price. My daughter has special needs and trouble opening her mouth, so I wanted a toothbrush that would provide stimulation and not have a HUGE neck and head on it. This fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Good spin action, two levels of bristles for finer cleaning, and stickers for your kid to decorate the toothbrush. YOU will need to help your child with this - the stickers are small, but stay on the brush well. I think they are cute, and a good variety. You will have lots leftover to use for whatever else you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I didn&#x27;t notice the holes in the head of the brush until I read another review. WTF? WHO puts holes in the head of a toothbrush for bacteria to collect? Grrr LOL that lowered my review by one star. The button to turn it on is a little tough for small fingers to turn on and off. You might need to help a younger child. The screw for this is TINY and very putzy - it does not take a rocket scientist to change it, but geez, you shouldn&#x27;t have to have a special screwdriver set to change a simple toothbrush battery (two triple A). There is no way to buy head replacements - it is all one piece, so that sucks when you need to replace it because of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DUH! Factor - This is what I call - duh, because I don&#x27;t think people pay enough attention to stuff they buy. They grab it off the shelf and go without looking at it. OF COURSE the batteries are going to die. Anything you buy in store, you can count on having to replace. With most things these days, invest in rechargeable batteries, problem solved. If you need a precision screwdriver set, I got a cheap one that has tons of heads and works great for tiny putzy toy battery covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a set, I think it&#x27;s a good investment in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008HUUUKU 23 Piece Precision Screwdriver Set]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the oneI have and I use it all the time for tons of things around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying this toothbrush again because of the open holes on the back. Thank you, reviewer, who pointed that out. Yuck.</li>
    <li> My two year old loves \\&quot;brushing her teeth\\&quot; but she never seems to accomplish much-just brushes the front teeth &amp; chews on the brush for a bit then tells me she is finished.  She finds this toothbrush very enjoyable &amp; I like the fact that she is keeping it in her mouth longer &amp; covering more area.  She also loved getting to decorate her own toothbrush.  We will be buying more of these.</li>
    <li> These are cute toothbrushes.  We gave our 2 oldest kids each one for Christmas. They loved putting the sticker on but it&#x27;s only been 4 months and the batteries are dead.  It&#x27;s annoying to have to keep putting money into a toothbrush that often.</li>
    <li> NEXT TO HAVING A SMALLER, MORE PROPERLY FITTED POWER BRUSH MADE SPECIFICALLY FOR TINY TOY DOGS, THIS SEEMS TO BE DOING THE TRICK. THE NOISE IS MINIMAL AND THEY DON&#x27;T HATE THEIR TEETH CLEANED AS MUCH AS THEY DID BEFORE.</li>
    <li> Got these for my niece and she loves them! The stickers are adorable and great for letting her express herself on her toothbrush!!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush for my \\&quot;almost\\&quot; 3 year old because her older brothers all have Sonicares (as do I). This toothbrush has been awesome. She loved decorating it and putting her name on it with the letter stickers, and she loves to brush her teeth like a big girl along side her brothers! We have had it for a few weeks now, and it seems to still be working great and for a great price! I will purchase from Amazon next time as this is the cheapest price I have seen for this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers that it is very hard to open the battery compartment because of the tiny screw made of soft metal. Nevertheless you can unscrew it with a knife having a hard tip.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my daughter and the first time she used it, it wouldn&#x27;t shut off. The batteries are very difficult to get out, because they require a tiny Phillips screwdriver AND I was having to try to unscrew it while the toothbrush was still vibrating! I read a similar experience on Amazon for the same toothbrush. It turns out that there was an  FDA warning issued for this toothbrush because off flying parts: (...)  It seems like this product should be recalled.</li>
    <li> My daughter had fun using the stickers on the toothbrush then using it. She loves that one but after a while( 1 month), the rolling part get stuck sometimes...so I guess it is time for a new one...</li>
    <li> My 2 year old used to hate brushing her teeth. I would seriously have to hold her down to do it and she would be screaming and crying the entire time, it was awful! I dreaded it every night. Well I picked up this electric toothbrush at a local store out of desperation. My daughter loved decorating it with the stickers. It comes with A LOT of stickers too. She loves brushing her teeth now. She actually runs into the bathroom when I say its time for her to brush her teeth. She likes to do it herself, but doesn&#x27;t mind when I help her get the ones in the back. We&#x27;ve had it a few weeks now and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my parents to give to my grand-daughter (their great grand-daughter of course) and she was so happyl She wanted to know how Santa Claus knew to tell my parents what he forgot to give her at home. It was a priceless moment, it works perfectly and is very cute.</li>
    <li> My kids love it, stickers let them make it their own.  Each time we get these they enjoy decorating them to personalize.  Work well too, easy enough to change the batteries too.</li>
    <li> And I love the sticker decorations. My 4 year old daughter LOVES it! It is perfect for her smaller mouth.</li>
    <li> I got this for my dogs teeth guys. :-D And it is a little loud but it seems to work and it is soooo cool that it has her name on it so no one will use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I may buy this for my family. I think kids would get a kick out of putting their name on their toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I buy these often and they definitely work well. My only issue was I found mold on one after a couple of months.</li>
    <li> My 2 1/2 yr old twins love this toothbrush. I liked that I could put their name on each one. We tease that it tickles their teeth so they like to brush now. (One previously screamed through each brushing). I like the way it is easy to turn on and off. If they hold it to their teeth they actually get some benefit from it too not like the manual brushes.</li>
    <li> My girl 2, loves brushing her teeth with her spinbrush. Although, there are now lots of pretty, glittery stickers around the house at her eye level instead of on the brush. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for a stocking stuffer for Christmas and got the Thomas one for my son.  My daughter LOVED decorating the toothbrush and we were so jazzed about brushing until we tried turning it on.  It made a terrible grinding, screeching sound!  We used it for a couple weeks like that and it just got worse and worse.  I thought maybe the batteries are almost dead and even got the special, tiny screwdriver that fit the screw to open the battery compartment.  Unfortunately, the screw was so tight, I couldn&#x27;t budge it without stripping the edges off the screw.  So, I guess if you buy it with fresh batteries and plan on it being disposable after one use, it would be fine.  But I was disappointed with this purchase and returned it within 30 days for a full refund.  I won&#x27;t tell you how sad my daughter was at having to return her work of art...</li>
    <li> The batteries die quickly. More importantly it is seemingly impossible to replace the battery (planned obsolescence if you ask me). I even bought a special screwdriver with tiny bits and was still unable to unscrew the backing. These toothbrushes are inexpensive, but I just don&#x27;t like the wastefulness.</li>
    <li> works pretty good. got it for my daughter and she likes the simple designs thank you I received this product at a highly discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Ma fille est ravie, elle a adoré positionner ses stickers. Mais apparemment la tête ne se change pas ?! (aurais-je mal compris ?)&lt;br /&gt;Il s&#x27;agit donc d&#x27;un modèle qui n&#x27;est pas fait pour durer dans le temps.&lt;br /&gt;Trouvé moins cher chez Target...</li>
    <li> I am an eight year old girl and i love my new toothbrush.  I was not fond of brushing my teeth till i bought this new tooth brush. I loved that i got to decorate my own way! I also like it because it makes my teeth so shiny. I love it so much i bring it every where. It is my favorite tooth brush i have ever got in my whole life. I have had no complaints on my tooth brush. It is just like my best toothbrush ever. I have had it for a few days now. And now i look forward to brushing my teeth, yeah yeah!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my 2 1/2 year old and I feel like her teeth get much cleaner than a regular manual toothbrush!  She also likes it when I brush her teeth with this and she used to fight me with a manual brush!  Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> This is very cute, but I&#x27;m glad I got a good deal on it. It lasted all of 6 weeks. No way to change the battery or the head.</li>
    <li> not sure if it&#x27;s the case for everyone. but for usthe battery ran out within a week. disappointed. without a battery it&#x27;s just a clunky normal brush.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use for cleaning those little teeth, and does a much better job that a standard toothbrush.  The battery will die after about 2 months, which is probably about as long as you want to be using a toothbrush, anyhow, so it&#x27;s kind of like a built-in timer, telling you it&#x27;s time for a new one.  At this price, I can live with that, and not worry about changing batteries.</li>
    <li> These things go through batteries like crazy.  Not sure how anyone couldn&#x27;t notice.  I have two of these dumb things.</li>
    <li> Bought for my graddaughter..  It was a good toothbrush...  My granddaughter loved it..  Will be able to use for a long time..  Thank you....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my cat and she loves it. It feels good on her teeth and gums. It is a perfect size for a cat and make brushing teeth more fun for the cat.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for an electric toothbrush for Christmas. She enjoyed decorating it and enjoys using it. It&#x27;s a great way to encourage brushing.</li>
    <li> this is the second electric toothbrush I have purchased for my daughter.  She loved decorating it and the movement of the head is too ruff against her baby teeth and strong enough to keep them clean.</li>
    <li> My 5 and 3 year old granddaughters just loved this toothbrush.  The were able to put stickers all over the base and actually brush longer than their little timer!  Dentist visit one month later was successful!</li>
    <li> This worked great for about a month and then just stopped. Since you need to replace your toothbrush often we were not terribly upset but I did expect it to last much longer. The bristles we soft enough for her to enjoy and yet stiff enough to clean her braces. We did not have to replace the batteries before it died (and no it was not just dead batteries). Easy to clean and fun for her to use until we upgraded her to a Sonic Care electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My kids love this toothbrush. In future I&#x27;m going to buy it from my local supermarket, it&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper there.</li>
    <li> This was by far their favorite Christmas present.  It&#x27;s sad to say these low-cost items were the ones they played with all day.  They don&#x27;t fight over which color toothbrush they want since they each have their names on them and they enjoy brushing with the spin action.</li>
    <li> The brush is easy to use and seems to clean our five year olds teeth well.  Requires batteries every 6-8 weeks or so.  Worth it for cleaner teeth.  Or rather our child to want to brush teeth a few times a day.</li>
    <li> Helped solve a problem -- how to get kid to actually move tooth brush around in mouth rather than just suck on the toothpaste.  Because this thing is always in motion, brushing comes more naturally.  And, my daughter loved decorating it and looks forward to using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush for my neice.  I thought it was a really cute and fun way to get her interested in having good dental hygiene.  She decorated it the way she wanted and she loves to brush her teeth.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has a difficult teeny tiny screw on the battery compartment. It will strip down very easily. My first 2 spinbrushes went in the garbage due to this issue. The new one that I bought, I changed the battery last night...it almost stripped away too, which prompted me to write a review on Amazon. Also, the batteries don&#x27;t last as long as I like, but I really brush my kids teeth.</li>
    <li> We bought 2. While they are cute, the battery for the first didn&#x27;t even last a week. The second one lasted about a month. I have bought many different types of children&#x27;s battery-operated toothbrushes. These are by far the worst.</li>
    <li> DID NOT RECEIVE THE TOOTHBRUSH PITCURED</li>
    <li> my girls were so excited with this toothbrush (boy that sounds odd!) but, it comes blank with these sheets of waterproof stickers. my girls (ages 9, 7, 4) spent a long time decorating them, adding their names in sticker letters. when it was time to get ready for bed and to brush their teeth, they were very excited to use their new, custom personalized toothbrushes. they work well. the on/off switch is a purple &amp;#34;gemstone&amp;#34;. a glamorous touch. very cute item. very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My girls loved to decorate their own. However you can&#x27;t change heads like other, adult spin rushes.  price was best I found</li>
    <li> Santa put these in the girls&#x27; stockings. They like to have their toothbrushes personalized with all the stickers that were included.</li>
    <li> I got one of these for my daughter for Christmas and she just loves it. I don&#x27;t know why kids like the spinning brushes better but what ever gets them to brush their teeth more.</li>
    <li> A cute gift for a toddler who wants to emulate her mom dad and sister. Perfect little gift for other ages as well.</li>
    <li> The brush is too big for a 2 yr old&#x27;s mouth. I think using an electric tooth brush like Braun or Oral B is the way to go since they have smaller brush head.</li>
    <li> Certainly made brushing teeth much more fun for my niece. She loved it.</li>
    <li> great for the young lady!</li>
    <li> The head of the brush wore out real quick. Couldnt open the section to replace the battery.&lt;br /&gt;The stickers are cool. That was the only nice part.</li>
    <li> I am  very very very happy with this and i recommened this to anyone who like this type of thing.</li>
    <li> My kids love this toothbrush! they used them daily! It feels like a game to them and keep their teeth clean! great buy!</li>
    <li> there is not replaceable brush head.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> This is a very cute idea, I just wish the stickers were a little easier to peel off of their pages. My daughter got upset when she couldn&#x27;t peel them off herself, and even I had a bit of a hard time peeling them. She did enjoy putting her name on her toothbrush, and being able to decorate it herself.</li>
    <li> So, granted, my daughter loved to decorate it. Also, it cleaned her teeth... but... Did no one ever imagine that you would need to change the head? I mean, come on, am I supposed to pay 3x as much for a one use brush? Really? Or do they think I am going to have my daughter use the same brush for the  next year....eeew[...]  Talk about bad planning. I am getting a different brand that I can change the head and get my own stickers.</li>
    <li> Works great. Smaller head fits the kids mouths easier. We have found that alkaline batteries seem to work better than the rechargeable ones.</li>
    <li> Terrible. As soon as it arrived we tried to open it up to add batteries but the screw stripped right away, making it completely unusable from the very start.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old daughter loves princess girly stuff so i chose this brush.  I wanted to get a more expensive electric toothbrush but this was a test run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves her toothbrush but given the limited timeframe for which her mouth is open the manual toothbrush does a better job.  After brushing, i can still scrape white gunk off her teeth with my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a test-run to see if your child will tolerate an electronic brush, go for it.  Do not however expect thorough cleaning.</li>
    <li> Very cool to decorate, and worked great for about 6 months, but changing batteries was a huge pain and now its dead 6 months after purchase.</li>
    <li> What do you put in a Christmas stocking for a 6 year old? An electric toothbrush to go along with all the candy, gum, and other goodies received on Christmas day. She loved putting the stickers on the toothbrush.</li>
