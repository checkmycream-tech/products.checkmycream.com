<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  Holds my hair great all day without leaving a residue or build up.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Good product for styling</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hairstylist.  Makes my hair soft and protects from heat.</li>
    <li> Never thought a volumizer could actually WORK... Boy was I wrong. Have used all the expensive brands before, including Alterna, L&#x27;anza, and everythign @the hairdresserts from Revlon to Redken to whatever - This stuff *actually* works. Can&#x27;t stop smiling when looking in the mirror - that HAIR!!(fine, nordic hair/shoulder length bob)</li>
    <li> This does not work for fine hair.  It weights fine hair down which  despite the reviews to the contrary, it isn&#x27;t true for me. I wish that I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money!!!</li>
    <li> overpriced for the quality. does not work as stated - at least not on fine hair.  my recommendation: don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Kerastase is the best!!! Really, there is no substitute! Just a little goes a long way. My hair is in really bad shape - thin, dry, etc. and this really makes it look and feel so much better. Great smell too.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  It works well with my hair which is straight and fine.  Hooray for great hair products!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and was using a couple of different products after each wash to blow dry to fullness. I discovered Forme Fatale via my hair salon and it is now the only product I need for blow drying. It leaves my hair shiny and with body which my hair lacks otherwise. My only problem is my salon will not carry it anymore because they had real problems with slow to now response from the Keratase rep in our area. I now order via Amazon, the price is about the same as the salon, and is admittedly pricey. It is worth the cost to me because I do not need to use much each wash/blow out and it replaces at least two other products.</li>
    <li> Very good product for blow drying hair. Gives lots of body and hold. Make sure not to apply too much! Kerastase getting better with their styling products now!</li>
    <li> Great product for a nice price. I recommend</li>
    <li> This is a truly amazing blow dry gel! I have streight, Asian hair, and have a lot of trouble getting it to curl and hold a curl, but I put a little more than a pea size in my palm and work it into damp hair, and my hair will hold a curl!!! Spritz on a little hairspray after and I&#x27;m good to go for the day! If I use a little extra hair spray, the curls will still hold and be wavy for a bed head/beachy look the second day! Makes curls hold all day without feeling crunchy - my friends were amazed at how soft my hair felt!</li>
    <li> I use the Volumifique shampoo, conditioner and this with the Kspray.  Finally my straight, fine hair has some body.  I love all these products.  And they smell good, too.</li>
    <li> Really tames down my hair and hair feels soft and silky after I straighten it.</li>
    <li> It was used&lt;br /&gt;By my hair dresser&lt;br /&gt;I have very natural curly hair and it works good to keep it straight</li>
    <li> This product is incredible. Used it with their leave in conditioner..blow dried my super curly hair, barely even using the brush and it was straight and voluminous. Its the best product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A MUST HAVE for anyone looking for the best blow out. I am shocked!!</li>
    <li> This product starts out feeling like nothing in your hair but does give body.  Having fine, thin and straight hair it amazed me.</li>
    <li> Love how soft it leaves my hair.  Use it on towel dried damp hair and it really helps with styling.</li>
    <li> great styling product</li>
    <li> Great stuff; really works well.</li>
    <li> Excellent ! Gives a  natural hold!  It makes the styling a lot easier and the  brushing to  last longer.</li>
    <li> This does not provide a great deal of volume, although my hair does have a nice sheen when dry and styled. I have short/medium hair length and my hair is very fine. I only use it when the weather is moderate and there&#x27;s very low humidity.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and straight. I rarely find a product that I buy again. I have bought this four times so far. Love</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! A little goes a long way and it makes my hair look great all day... No muss, no fuss and I am out the door! Love it!</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair or thin hair this IS NOT THE PRODUCT for you</li>
    <li> Love this product, great for days you are planning to curl</li>
    <li> This is a superior product, expensive, smells lovely and really works.</li>
    <li> Love it, use it all the time</li>
