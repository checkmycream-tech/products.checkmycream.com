<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product.  I got started on peeling gels from a sample from another brand I got from the skinstore.  I loved it so much, I went to Sephora and bought a tube of it.... for $45!!!  I started looking into other brands to see if I could get a cheaper price.  Here is the low-down from what I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I read other reviews and some people say that it is just the gel turning into beads as it dries and that it isn&#x27;t skin at all.  So I did some experiments...  I put some peeling gel on my face and rubbed it around like I was supposed to.  The good peeling gel ( I will name names later) lifted dead skin and it balled up underneath my fingers into what felt like small BB sized wads of wet paper mulch.  I too thought that it was just the gel hitting air and drying.  So I tried it again a few minutes later with much smaller balls of dead skin.  So I put on a rubber glove and applied it to my bathroom countertop.  I rubbed and rubbed and the gel never formed little balls.  It just dried on my counter top.  I also waited a few days and really exfoliated half of my face with some major microdermabrasion cream that I had.  I used the gel on my face and could tell the exfoliated half of my face didn&#x27;t form any wet paper balls at all while the non-exfoliated side really made some wet paper balls of dead skin.  my skin is so soft and some chronically flaky areas on my forehead no longer have the rough patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, which brand is better than the other?  I have tried Skinfood Pineapple Morning, Missha Super Aqua, Cure Natural Aqua Gel and Peter Thomas Roth Peeling Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cure Natural Aqua Gel barely made any dry skin beads at all.  I even dried my face so as not to water it down and it didn&#x27;t make much difference.  My husband allowed me to apply it to his back and it felt like I was just rubbing in some lotion.  If nothing came off of his back, then you know it didn&#x27;t work well because he was in serious need of an exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missha Super Aqua Gel is slightly better.  It would make small beads after some rubbing.  I followed with some of the better brands and still got large beads of dead skin so I really didn&#x27;t think this was as effective as it could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Thomas Roth and Skinfood are tied with how awesome it works.  I must be honest and admit though that I will be buying Skinfood from now on because it is soooooo much cheaper than Peter Thomas Roth!!!  PTR charges $35 and Skinfood charges $10.  You do that math.  And I am not giving up quality or quantity.  If PTR was the same price as Skinfood, then I would be torn as to which one I would buy.  But until then, Skinfood is IT.&lt;br /&gt;Missha Super Aqua Gel is slightly better.  It would make small beads after some rubbing.  I followed with some of the better brands and still got large beads of dead skin so I really didn&#x27;t think this was as effective as it could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Thomas Roth and Skinfood are tied with how awesome it works.

    <li> Okay first, the little bits of stuff that ball up with rubbing is NOT dead skin. The product does this on any surface with sufficient rubbing, I tested it by applying a small amount to the side of a plastic container &amp; rubbing it in with a latex makeup sponge. However, because you are rubbing that stuff around on your face, the balled up bits help to exfoliate &amp; remove dead skin cells, you just don&#x27;t shed a dramatic amount. I could tell it definitely did something, the rolled up balls that resulted from rubbing the plastic container remained completely white while the ones from my face were dingy &amp; dirty looking. After rinsing it off, my skin looked cleaner, brighter &amp; smoother. (And my face was freshly washed right before I applied the gel so it was already &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34;) The description says it contains alpha hydroxy acids &amp; pineapple extract (bromelain?) which are two ingredients well known to help dissolve the bonds that hold the dead cells together. Chemical peels are done using AHAs but need to be fairly concentrated &amp; have a low pH to cause actual peeling. This gel has very low concentrations of AHAs &amp; the pH is too close to neutral to have that type of immediate effect. (which is the case for most OTC products containing AHAs, they work over time instead.) This gel is not a completely worthless product as it does exfoliate really well but its not exactly living up to its name as something that causes peeling.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I had heard of peeling masks/gel but it&#x27;s hard to find them for a reasonable price in the US. I knew it was shipping from Korea so I had to wait a little while. It arrived in about 2 weeks. This works great! You rub it in and it pills up, grabbing dead skin as it goes. After rinsing my skin was very soft and felt squeeky clean. I have very sensitive skin and was worried about having a reaction to it, but it ended up being very gentle and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it at all. I love it! I will be adding it to my regular weekly skincare regime. It&#x27;s definitely worth the wait for it to make it through customs.</li>
    <li> i love it even my skin is peeling.. its makin my skin soft and healthy :) i will order again soon!</li>
    <li> it was delivered on time but it doesnt work that well it absorbs into the skin to quickly and doesnt really exfoliate well its nothing like the ones at the mall</li>
    <li> Works as intended and the quality is great, thank you! :)</li>
    <li> Skin feels really soft and smooth after</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  This left my skin feeling SO SOFT.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, just buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Appropriate for a light exfoliation, nothing special, would not purchase again</li>
    <li> This exfoliates without irritating skin. I use it in the evening after washing my face, let dry then I put this to exfoliate then the republic soothing cream face wash.</li>
    <li> This is great. I&#x27;ve tried so many peels and while this is so gentle that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s actually peeling my skin so much as acting as an exfoliant, I think that&#x27;s what I like most. I feel like my skin is being cleaned and it isn&#x27;t trying to pull. I&#x27;m a birchbox subscriber in the U.S. and have tried many peels. Each one dries while I&#x27;m rubbing and pulls at the fine blond peach fuzz right under my cheek bones. This does not, AND it smells good. I love how gentle, yet effective it is!</li>
    <li> Love this peeling gel. My skin feels patch free and baby smooth.</li>
    <li> Really great peeling gel. My face feels great after using this product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT ! You don&#x27;t need a very big amount of it to peel your whole face. The smell is lovely fruity. It is easy to rince and I feel that my skin is clean and soft after it.</li>
    <li> I even had people Asking me the  order from them very good product!</li>
    <li> By far my favorite thing to use! I&#x27;ve been using cure for the longest time and it&#x27;s pretty pricey so I switch between pure and the Korean bamboo to peel off dead skins cell. It&#x27;s soo amazing to use this in the morning it also helps my makeup stay on a lot longer and literally makes my face more awake and brighter looking. I stopped using the other 2 because they were out and not really affordable. But this makes my bathroom smell so nice and it has the smell of pineapple and I love it! I use it every morning and it came a lot bigger then I thought lol which is good. I&#x27;m super happy I purchase this and I will continue to use skin food! Love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different peels and thought I&#x27;d give this one a go. This is a great and very thorough type of peel, (I call it Peel Power, and this one ranks high.) It smells wonderful and leaves your skin feeling super smooth right away. I use this on my neck and chest, knees, elbows and top of my hands for a good and satisfying exfoliation.  Skinfood products are 5 stars for being all natural (a big deal for me)  and really effective.  Pineapple is good for cell renewal so you&#x27;re getting a double bonus with a very thorough exfoliation and skin renewal.  Wear a high SPF sunscreen after using skin peels as skin is more new and easily burned. I have a oily t-zone with large pores and I exfoliate about twice a week.  Too much of this and it throws your skin pH off balance and you don&#x27;t want to do that.  The pineapple also does a lightening affect  which is especially nice for mature skin.</li>
    <li> Best exfoliater ever!! I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Maybe I received an item from a bad batch or something because this product just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Or perhaps the overseas shipping changed the composition of the product itself because when I ordered it, it was scorching hot during the course of shipment.  Anyway, I&#x27;m going to compare it to Cure Aqua Gel because it is the gold standard for peeling gels. Cure was a very good product when I used it awhile back.  I&#x27;d barely rub it on my skin and my dead skin just sloughs right off.  If I used it on a pimple, sometimes the gel would remove a layer off the pimple, making it easier for me to extract it, whilst still being gentle.  So that is how Cure worked for me.  With the Skinfood Pineapple Morning Peeling gel, the gel would clump up within half a second of touching my skin and I know the little clumping particles are not my dead skin because after cleaning the gel completely off, I&#x27;d rub my skin and grime would come off.  This is a sign that the gel doesn&#x27;t work because there should be no grime or dead skin left for you to rub off. This gel doesn&#x27;t work...at least not for me.</li>
    <li> It is my holy grail product. It helps my acne scars fade away and get rid of dead skins.</li>
    <li> When I took mine out of the box I could immediately smell the pineapple. Strangely enough, when I put it on, the scent wasn&#x27;t as strong as I was expecting it to be. My skin is starting to thin a little around my right eye, but after I&#x27;ve applied this I could see that the skin around my eyes have improved. I tried to use it twice in one week and have found my skin a lot drier so maybe once will be good.</li>
    <li> Did not like this peel</li>
    <li> Smells like pineapple and works well, very gentle but exfoliate well. However, it is a very small bottle considering it is 10 bucks.</li>
    <li> Contains parabens! :(&lt;br /&gt;Gel like cream turns into separated peel like particles mimicking dead skin sloughing off. Smells fresh with a hint of citrus.</li>
    <li> Pretty darn awesome. Makes my face feel really fresh and clean and smooth. I also suspect its use has decreased my frequency of acne breakouts, but correlation !&#x3D; causation so who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use a lot of face products--or any, really--but one of my students gave me a Skinfood peach sake mask once and I loved the amazing peach smell. So I went hunting for another product to try and landed on this one. The smell of this stuff is fine, mildly citrusy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is very convenient; it is easy to open, doesn&#x27;t clog, and dispenses as much or as little as is needed. Go for just a little--it goes a surprisingly long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day or two, but honestly I think I could use it every day with no harm done. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry me out or irritate my face in any way. I have normal/oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO USE (figured out by trial and error--I am a skin product dunce)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash your face before you use this. It sounds kind of dumb but just bear with me. Wash your face and you can even scrub it beforehand if you like. So that you think it&#x27;s clean. Hah! It&#x27;s not! Pineapple morning gel has a thing or two to show you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry your face. Don&#x27;t put it on a wet face, it ruins the magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put some gel on your dry face and rub with your fingertips. Rub in light circles first and then start rubbing hard. Think face massage, but more rubby. Do this over a sink, preferably a white one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, the gel will start to pill up and form weird little solid bits. Keep rubbing. Those weird little solid things will keep coming for a while, then eventually run out. If you feel like you haven&#x27;t gotten your rub on enough, add more and rub again. I rub a lot on my cheeks and the sides of my nose, everywhere else gets a cursory rubbing. Rub where you feel like you need it I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In your white sink should now be lots of little weird dry crumbles. Which will appear grey and weird and gross. Now turn on the water and wash your face and wash them away. Fun times! Goodbye dirt!on the water and wash your face and wash them away. Fun times! Goodbye dirt!</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this too often as it could dry out the skin. About 1 - 3 times a week should do if your skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive. Has a fruity fragrance. Leaves skin smooth but quite dry so a follow-up moisterizer is a must! I don&#x27;t dislike it but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again due to my dry skin. I&#x27;ve always used the Tonymoly apple massage peeling cream because it thoroughly moisterizes my skin after every use though it does take a while to massage it in (10-15 minutes). Thought I should try something new once in a while and the skinfood apple morning isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!  Already ordered more!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of cool and disgusting at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it when my skin was kind of flaky from being outside too much.&lt;br /&gt;A LOT of skin came off. And it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. It&#x27;s just a nice tingly feeling,</li>
    <li> I agrree with the other questional reviews</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> It &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; like it works as described because it removes some dead skin cells and leaves my skin feeling soft. However, the scent is strong and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually removing all dirty stuff</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I have the Cure (expensive and works very well) and the TonyMoly&#x27;s Apple peel (adorable and works also). I&#x27;ve got to say this Pineapple one is awesome! I&#x27;ll spend 40$ on Cure&#x27;s peel again. I did have to have TonyMolys just for the adorable packaging! Seriously my fave peel! It doesn&#x27;t have too harsh a smell, and works fast! Make sure your face is clean but DRY! It will blow you away how much dead skin can come off of a clean face. Lol I have a Clairsonic Mia to exfoliate, but I feel that this could replace it! Amazing product! I will repurchase when I run out. 😊</li>
    <li> So far I have only used it on my face. The peeling gel does a great job, it is very gentle. After using it my face gets a lot smoother. Recommend using it once every two weeks.</li>
    <li> Nothing special on this product, I was never able to peel...because just crumples on my skin. xo</li>
    <li> I will get this again. I like the way it make my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Works wonders!!! Totally helped with my acne spots and I think my face can absorb moisture and nutrition way better because my face had never looked this good!!! Oh how I love skinfood</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product. It makes my skin sooo soft and smells really nice, sharp and sweet! Very sweet packaging as well</li>
    <li> i have used many peeling gel but this is good peeling gel from skinfood.  but i prefer the one used previously.  i purchased based on good review but i like the other peeling gel</li>
    <li> First I bought 2 bottles based on previous reviews. Then I bought 6 after got my order and tried it by myself. This fact says everything.&lt;br /&gt;I used several brands before. This pineapple cleans better than any of them. Twice a week is enough for me otherwise skin feels some discomfort. With the rest I was able to use them each and every day. But they were too gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that with time the other gels were becoming less effective. Last two bottles of Aqua gel are total waste of money. Missha got spoiled also. I have the old one I was using for face for a year. The new ones are not cleaning that much. I made few experiments. So while this pineapple gel cleans so well I will buy few more. It cleans great! I&#x27;m using for face and body. It cleans dead skin even after clarisonic. I use lots of cream as my skin is dry/normal. I believe that the cream penetrates way better to my skin. I&#x27;m very glad that found this product. And thanks to all other reviewers.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! It&#x27;s work!</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
    <li> THAT&#x27;S very good item.</li>
    <li> It a very good peeling gel. I like this type of peeling, my skin is very soft and smooth after it. It smells like pineapple too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve gone through at least 3 maybe 4 bottles of it. I use it a few times a week and every time I am amazed as how much skin it takes off. If you have acne you know the struggle of using a scrub to exfoliate your skin, its painful and not very effective. This stuff works great on acne prone skin, its non-abrasive so it won&#x27;t rupture any active breakouts you have on your skin. You can always use this on your body as well. I use it to help fade scars and stretch marks, it also works great at removing dead skin around your cuticles!!!</li>
    <li> It works great! It pills up while it exfoliates. Face feels great afterwards!</li>
