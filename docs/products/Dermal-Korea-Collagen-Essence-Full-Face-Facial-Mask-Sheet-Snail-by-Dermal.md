    <li> waste of money1 doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin</li>
    <li> This mask works great.  Made my face soft.  Here&#x27;s a tip...after you have removed the mask  from you face, wipe the heals of your feet with the mask.  The remaining Collagen on the mask works wonders to soften your feet also.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  Mask is soothing and covers your entire face. Gives the skin a deeper, thicker, plumped look; bright fresh and young.</li>
    <li> Long term effects aside, my skin always looks better the next day. Score. I haven&#x27;t had them long enough to tell if there is a long term effect, but moisture can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> It helps moisturize my face and keep my skin soft for I can feel visible difference for about 3 days.</li>
    <li> Good price, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love the product. My skin feels so soft after. I use it for a good 30 minutes then wipe the rest on my shoulders and elbows. You can run the rest anywhere desired.</li>
    <li> Very good production.</li>
    <li> every week I put a patch of collagen nourishes my skin leaving it soft smooth and hydrated Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality ~. give moisture to your skin .</li>
    <li> I have oily and acne prone skin and this product made me break out</li>
    <li> I have tried oodles of Korean and Japanese cloth masks, and these are, by far, the least useful. The actual cloth is flimsy and cheap (kind of itchy against the skin), the amount of liquid inside is questionnable (as well as liquid&#x27;s viscosity - might as well be water), and there is no before/after effect compared to other masks of this same kind that makes skin supple and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money and waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, you can tell this is a lower-line cheap cosmetics - Korean stores sell these for about 50 cents per pack. STAY AWAY.</li>

    <li> I absolutely love love love this mask. Repairs, regenerates, and helps heal damaged and aging skin. It is the very best.</li>
    <li> Great price for great product !!</li>
