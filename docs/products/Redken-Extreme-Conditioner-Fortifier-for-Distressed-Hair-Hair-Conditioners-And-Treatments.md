      <li>I&#x27;ve already noticed a HUGE difference in my hair.  </li>
      <li>I also have to use a huge clump of this conditioner in order to spread it around on my hair</li>
      <li>After trying a couple of brands to keep my hair in good condition and help the treatment last longer, Redken Extreme conditioner is the best one I have try.</li>

      <li>Leaves hair soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money, you&#x27;ll see results right away.</li>
      <li>Redken Extreme Conditioner is one of the best from the entire Redken lines.</li>
      <li>This smells wonderful and it definitely made my hair stronger but be warned, if you use this too much it will dry your hair out and it will start breaking off.  </li>
      <li>They all work great on my very dry hair, leaving it shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>This conditioner rebuilds my hair, leaving it strong and soft.</li>
      <li>With the original formula, I had to use the Extreme conditioner sparingly on my thick hair which was pretty dry from lots of blowdrying, because it was so incredibly moisturizing and rich.</li>
      <li>The bottle I ordered was not the real product.</li>
      <li>I know I needed an emergency fix fast.</li>
      <li>and she really likes it.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner set really help with the hair breakage that I have because of some medications that I&#x27;m on.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t work, not sure why because this is the 3rd bottle I have purchased of this item and the first 2 worked great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and will continue to use it along with many other Redken products.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>

      <li>If you&#x27;re used to the old formula</li>
      <li>High marks for the hair product, low marks for the person who had the idea to cheapen the cap.  </li>
      <li>Whereas before, I had to be careful to wash it off pretty fast or risk making my hair too oily, I can put gobs of the stuff my hair for several minutes before washing it off, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized in the slightest after I dry it.</li>
      <li>Definitely would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought directly from Amazon.com</li>
      <li>I have always have curly and freeze hair very difficult to handle and keep in good condition.</li>

<li> I have always have curly and freeze hair very difficult to handle and keep in good condition.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s no significant smell to this particular type of conditioner.</li>
<li> THIS formula is completely different and after five months of using it, it has left my hair dry, lackluster, and frizzy.</li>
<li> Doesnt leave hair flat, greasey or gummy feeling.  </li>
<li> Goes too fast since I have long thick hair.</li>
<li> I have long, straight and thick hair and after using this conditioner it made my hair frizzy and curly when it&#x27;s normally not.  </li>
<li> This moisturizer is a waste of money, and I am certainly not going to be purchasing Redken&#x27;s new formula again.</li>
<li> My hair just came back to life after using the conditioner and Redken extreme treatment.</li>
<li> I would also recommend this product for people with dry hair.</li>
<li> Since I started using this product, I have had a lot less hair left in the sink when I brush it out at night.  </li>
<li> I use the extreme because of the length of my hair and being that long</li>
<li> Only a little bit is needed.  </li>
<li> It was expensive but worth it.</li>
<li> Alittle goes a long way, you don&#x27;t want to weigh down your hair.</li>
<li> My hair was weak and breaking from being taken out of a weave back to back for over 2 yrs.</li>
<li> If you have a damaged hair due to color n bleach ...</li>
<li> I also like extreme anti-snap for a leave in treatment.</li>
<li> I was disappointed and better off with garnier</li>
<li> I even cut off seven inches of hair around the time I ordered it, and my hair is shoulder length, which should make it easier to keep moisturized due to its proximity to the scalp.</li>
<li> I purchased Redken extreme about 2-yrs ago.</li>
<li> Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner and treatment.</li>
<li> This product leaves my hair dry and dead looking.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s not very rich at all.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, unbeknownst to me, Redken changed the formula on their conditioner before I ordered this gigantic bottle size, and it is extremely ineffective in comparison to the older formula.</li>
<li> Not as conditioning as the previous version.</li>
<li> I never seen my hair so fragile and weak.</li>
<li> It might appear expensive but the bottles last for a VERY long time.</li>
<li> I wear my hair in a ponytail or braid everyday and my hair was breaking at the band.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday because it would be too harsh</li>
<li> I am extremely disappointed with Redken&#x27;s new formula for their Extreme Conditioner.</li>
<li> Over the past year</li>
<li> My hairdresser sells this at the shop but is so expensive for a little bottle</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad but a little plain.</li>
<li> Beware, this product might be fake.</li>
<li> I guess, my hair was in need of protein really bad.</li>
<li> This conditioner is terrible, if you can even call it a conditioner.  </li>
<li> This product is terrible!</li>

    <li> Wife bought this and she really likes it.  It does what it claims it is suppose to do.  Once it runs out will be buying more...</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and healthy. Definitely would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought directly from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner.  Doesnt leave hair flat, greasey or gummy feeling.  Hair shines, looks full, and healthy.</li>
    <li> Good moisture but prefer the Magnetics line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s and also have hair extensions. This product is great for both! It moisturizes my own hair and keeps my extensions looking shiny and healthy. I&#x27;ve used this for years and will continue to use it along with many other Redken products.</li>
    <li> This is amazing conditioner!  It&#x27;s light and full of protein.  I&#x27;ve already noticed a HUGE difference in my hair.  I&#x27;ll be using this for years to come!</li>
    <li> Redken Extreme Conditioner is one of the best from the entire Redken lines. My hair was weak and breaking from being taken out of a weave back to back for over 2 yrs. I never seen my hair so fragile and weak. My hair was falling out all over the floor, sink, and comb. I know I needed an emergency fix fast. I purchased Redken extreme about 2-yrs ago. The shampoo and the conditioner and the treatment. I used the shampoo, the conditioner, and the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed a plastic cap over my head with the treatment on my hair. I sat under a heating cap for 20 min. Rinsed, and my hair stop falling out after one use. I guess, my hair was in need of protein really bad. My hair just came back to life after using the conditioner and Redken extreme treatment. When I&#x27;m having a hair emergency, I now know what to reach for.&lt;br /&gt;Redken Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner and treatment.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is top of the line , best of the best , I have used this conditioner for many years , it&#x27;s for all hair types, you will really love the shine and softness your hair will have.</li>
    <li> This conditioner rebuilds my hair, leaving it strong and soft. I don&#x27;t use it everyday because it would be too harsh but I use it as a deep conditioner. Love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent Hair Conditioner</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed with Redken&#x27;s new formula for their Extreme Conditioner. I am used to buying this in the largest bottle size since it was amazing and I used nothing else for years. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to me, Redken changed the formula on their conditioner before I ordered this gigantic bottle size, and it is extremely ineffective in comparison to the older formula. (The bottle proclaims that it is a new formula). With the original formula, I had to use the Extreme conditioner sparingly on my thick hair which was pretty dry from lots of blowdrying, because it was so incredibly moisturizing and rich. It was expensive but worth it. THIS formula is completely different and after five months of using it, it has left my hair dry, lackluster, and frizzy. Whereas before, I had to be careful to wash it off pretty fast or risk making my hair too oily, I can put gobs of the stuff my hair for several minutes before washing it off, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized in the slightest after I dry it. I even cut off seven inches of hair around the time I ordered it, and my hair is shoulder length, which should make it easier to keep moisturized due to its proximity to the scalp. This moisturizer is a waste of money, and I am certainly not going to be purchasing Redken&#x27;s new formula again. If you&#x27;re used to the old formula like I was, beware -- don&#x27;t spend all this money on a giant bottle of conditioner and expect it to be of the same quality.</li>
    <li> Excelent product! I do recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> It was delivered on time in perfect condition. This product is great for my processed hair. It helps to keep it healthy and soft. I also like extreme anti-snap for a leave in treatment. I have used Redken for years. It is my favorite. It might appear expensive but the bottles last for a VERY long time.</li>
    <li> I have always have curly and freeze hair very difficult to handle and keep in good condition. After apply Japanese straightening and Brazilian keratin treatment the change was incredible and my hair after over 8 months looks amazing.   After trying a couple of brands to keep my hair in good condition and help the treatment last longer, Redken Extreme conditioner is the best one I have try. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Beware, this product might be fake. The bottle I ordered was not the real product.</li>
    <li> I have used redken for years and loved their products.. until they changed the formula. This product is terrible! It does nothing for my hair but make it greasy. Yikes.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is terrible, if you can even call it a conditioner.  It&#x27;s no different from all the cheaper Pantene conditioners, just a lot more expensive.  I have long, straight and thick hair and after using this conditioner it made my hair frizzy and curly when it&#x27;s normally not.  I don&#x27;t believe I saw anything in regards to \\&quot;for curly\\&quot; hair on this product.  My hair also looks duller than normal after using this product as well.  I also have to use a huge clump of this conditioner in order to spread it around on my hair, it&#x27;s not very rich at all.  The texture and effectiveness of this product is almost like those 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioners.  I will definitely not use a Redken product again.</li>
    <li> I have waist length hair and this co. is the best for keeping your hair in good shape and growing stronger. I use the extreme because of the length of my hair and being that long I need all the help I can get. My hairdresser sells this at the shop but is so expensive for a little bottle this is so much more cost effective. And i get free shipping from Amazon, so it is a win win situation!!</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner, leave my hair soft, easy to brush and moisturized!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner set really help with the hair breakage that I have because of some medications that I&#x27;m on. Leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
    <li> If you have a damaged hair due to color n bleach ...this s perfect conditioner...</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner! I also use the shampoo and the anti-snap cream. They all work great on my very dry hair, leaving it shiny and soft. I don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair soft. There&#x27;s no significant smell to this particular type of conditioner. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad but a little plain. I like it my daughter uses it too &amp; her hair has improved in manageability &amp; appearance after tons of bleaching. Works great !</li>
    <li> This is the best product out there for dry, processed hair. It&#x27;s worth the money, you&#x27;ll see results right away.</li>
    <li> Ive been trying to get my color treated hair back in good condition and this is, by far, the best product for dry and damaged hair.  Only a little bit is needed.  Very impressed</li>
    <li> Great for tangly hair</li>
    <li> I would also recommend this product for people with dry hair. Alittle goes a long way, you don&#x27;t want to weigh down your hair.Another winner !!!</li>
    <li> I wear my hair in a ponytail or braid everyday and my hair was breaking at the band.  Since I started using this product, I have had a lot less hair left in the sink when I brush it out at night.  It feels thicker and stronger.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and it is excellent.  Over the past year or so they changed the design of their cap and I have to say that I thoroughly dislike it.  Way more flimsy than the prior version and clearly a cost cutting move.  I&#x27;m still buying the product, but if the cap aggravates me.  If something else comes along that I like, I&#x27;ll switch products.  May seem crazy to get stuck on a lid, but I really liked the way it was.  High marks for the hair product, low marks for the person who had the idea to cheapen the cap.  Same thing with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have naturally course, wavy hair. This product leaves my hair dry and dead looking. Every time I use it, I have to put miracle 10 keratin AND coconut oil in my hair to even walk out the door. I was disappointed and better off with garnier</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for about 1 year now, and it works great. It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy film, but its not too light. I think its a great everyday conditioner.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work, not sure why because this is the 3rd bottle I have purchased of this item and the first 2 worked great.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and it definitely made my hair stronger but be warned, if you use this too much it will dry your hair out and it will start breaking off.  Use it for awhile, then switch to 1-2 times per week.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula. Not as conditioning as the previous version.</li>
    <li> great conditioner! Goes too fast since I have long thick hair.</li>
