      <li>and I LOVE them.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I will buy more.</li>
      <li>Was expecting a lot more based on the reviews.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>but I still absolutely love the product.</li>
      <li>but I wish I knew how to use it better.</li>
      <li>Maybe I needed to practice more or it needed clearer instructions.</li>
      <li>But come on, if you read this, you&#x27;re basically looking for something to help you look good, not a solution to world peace, right?)</li>
      <li>It has been exactly what I&#x27;ve been needing!!!</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like devacurl products, as I have heard so many good things about it.</li>
      <li>but it didnt work so fine to me...</li>
      <li>:  I do not have the vocabulary, time, or space to adequately describe how pleased I am with it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have really curly hair, but I love the way it&#x27;s beginning to curl and developing a whole style of its own!</li>
      <li>I thought since they are used in salons, they would be very good, but my hair is very dry with the styling products.</li>
      <li>The seller was actually very good, exchanged he gel with the one I had expected without any problems.</li>
      <li>the gel is light but holds my hair in place.</li>
      <li>Products that worked wonderfully for a few weeks seemed to fizzle after extended use.</li>
      <li>I loved what my hair looked like in the early days of using it though and wish they had a lighter line that I could use now.</li>
      <li>I now love my hair and it is now in real ringlets!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used shampoo for over a year, using baking soda and water to clean my hair, so I didn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals to get out of my hair.</li>
      <li>This is a simple regimen to use, it leaves my hair nice and soft, and I now love what my hair is becoming!</li>
      <li>It is amazing for naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have a full bottle of the gel that I don’t know what to do with</li>
      <li>But as soon as I figured out how much my hair needed, it was like magic.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cause my hair is full of silicons and sulfates , so ...&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have super curly hair and the product</li>
      <li>so this purchase was great because I got to try 3 products for less.</li>
      <li>The product did a great job for a few months.</li>
      <li>each their own with this product, but it was definitely a miss for me.</li>
      <li>Love the way it brings out my natural curl.</li>
      <li>They make my curls look so much more defined, springy, and soft.</li>
      <li>The rose fragrance was so overpowering I had to wash my hair with regular shampoo to get it out.  </li>
      <li>Having been a curly-top all of my life, and both suffering and enjoying the envy of most of my family and friends (suffering when I was younger and wanted spiked straight shocks of Joan Jett-style hair, enjoying when was older and had the cascading waves of curl that made me feel like a model) it was always a struggle to find a decent shampoo and conditioner that actually worked in the long-term.</li>
      <li>If you have curly hair, this whole line is a must!</li>
      <li>I really like these products!</li>
      <li>I love the Deva Curl line, but this is NOT the same product that is sold in salons.</li>
      <li>thought I was going to use and get the result I was dreaming of in the first</li>
      <li>Turns out with a little bit of love and DevaCurl, I have fabulous, no maintenance, curly hair with no frizz!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn’t ready to pay $20</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>It does not smell like the real deva curl.</li>
      <li>the light gel doesn&#x27;t quite have enough hold for my hair.</li>
      <li>I always blow my hair out straight and used to have to put on a crème product</li>
      <li>I have hair that varies from tighter curls to very very loose waves, but I love the line.</li>
      <li>But now I really like it.</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>Very disapointed in product.  </li>
      <li>Very moisturizing for my 4a/4b hair.  </li>
      <li>I had always thought I had stubborn straight hair that wouldn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
      <li>Do not use too much.</li>
      <li>You might be very pleasantly surprised!!!</li>
      <li>the conditioner does not moisture my hair as expected; on the other hand, the no poo is sooo good, i was affraid to leave the traditional shampoo, but the no poo leaves my sculp feeling fresh and my hair clean.</li>
      <li>i try some other variety, i may get better results.</li>
      <li>Smells fresh and clean and my hair is shinier and smoother with less frizz.</li>
      <li>On the picture the bottles look super big</li>
      <li>made my hair soft and super cute the first day then it would get instantly tangled, matted and so unmanageable the days following until wash day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using the product after a month because my hair got so dry (straw-like in feeling)</li>
      <li>DO NOT waste your money buying it from amazon, spend a little more to get the real stuff from a salon</li>
      <li>This is a lil&#x27; spendier than I would normally spend, but I did my research and decided to take a chance.</li>
      <li>Prior to this, the scent was delicate and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner are my faves--very moisturizing, but they don&#x27;t weigh my hair down (med-very curly, not thick and fine).</li>
      <li>I am new to this product.</li>
      <li>Exactly the same as the product found in stores.</li>
      <li>have made my hair so soft!  </li>
      <li>My hair feels clean and not as frizzy as it is with other products.</li>
      <li>I am a recent convert to the whole no sulfate/alcohol ingredients in hair products craze.  </li>
      <li>Made my hair feel greasy not fluffy like I anticipated.</li>
      <li>I simply take a bit in one hand, gently rub my hands together to prep, and scrunch it into my curls.</li>
      <li>after I towel dried my hair or else it would be frizzy and not be smooth.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;re lucky if half what you put in your hands makes it to your head, and the gel doesn&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
      <li>The cost is a little high and maybe more suited for less kinky hair.</li>
      <li>I have had curly hair and by curly, I mean frizzy and large, this whole line has taken that all away!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I recently read the book &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34; on my Kindle. I had always thought I had stubborn straight hair that wouldn&#x27;t stay put. I read a sample of the book and decided I might just have border-line curly hair. I decided to try these products and I LOVE them. I don&#x27;t have really curly hair, but I love the way it&#x27;s beginning to curl and developing a whole style of its own! I haven&#x27;t used shampoo for over a year, using baking soda and water to clean my hair, so I didn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals to get out of my hair. This is a simple regimen to use, it leaves my hair nice and soft, and I now love what my hair is becoming! If you want to see what your curlyish hair can become, I recommend getting the book, reading it, and then trying these products, and using their suggestions. You might be very pleasantly surprised!!! I was...and am!</li>
    <li> Not for African American kinky hair.  The cost is a little high and maybe more suited for less kinky hair.</li>
    <li> But there&#x27;s a problem ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was going to use and get the result I was dreaming of in the first try.&lt;br /&gt;But I found out that it will take AT LEAST 6 weeks ...&lt;br /&gt;Cause my hair is full of silicons and sulfates , so ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Devacurl is really awesome  !&lt;br /&gt;I recommend if u like me have enough patience to wait for the results ! :D</li>
    <li> Amazing results in my hair!</li>
    <li> The DevaCurl product line was recommended to me. I wasn’t ready to pay $20+ per bottle so this purchase was great because I got to try 3 products for less. I have super curly hair and the product made my hair soft and super cute the first day then it would get instantly tangled, matted and so unmanageable the days following until wash day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using the product after a month because my hair got so dry (straw-like in feeling) and I couldn’t do anything with it. I have a full bottle of the gel that I don’t know what to do with and I also have about a quarter of the no-poo and one condition left that I will no longer use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To each their own with this product, but it was definitely a miss for me.</li>
    <li> if you have curly hair, this is a great product. Do not use too much. It does go a long way.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing for my 4a/4b hair.  Conditioner provides long lasting results when used as a deep conditioner and left on your hair for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> excellent product and fast shipping.  thank you!</li>
    <li> I have always been to on the lookout for the best curl stuff. This is a lil&#x27; spendier than I would normally spend, but I did my research and decided to take a chance. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the shampoo and conditioner. Smells fresh and clean and my hair is shinier and smoother with less frizz. I personally didn&#x27;t like the the gel, I have tried it a few times, and I don&#x27;t always have consistent results. I think I need something stronger. I have hair that varies from tighter curls to very very loose waves, but I love the line.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and until recently, it was dry and frizzy. I had no idea that the products I was using were to blame. Turns out with a little bit of love and DevaCurl, I have fabulous, no maintenance, curly hair with no frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very low maintenance with my hair and this product line works well for me. I wash my hair with the shampoo once a week. Condition twice a week. And I use the Angel product whenever I get my hair wet. The shampoo does not foam. It took me a while to get use to it. But now I really like it. Also, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel soap-y either and it can be rinsed off our left in. Finally the gel. Its amazing. I put a bunch in  when my hair when its wet and just scrunch it and go. When my hair drys, its perfect, curly, and has no frizz. As a warning, you have to use a lot of each product. It took me about 3 weeks until I was using enough. But as soon as I figured out how much my hair needed, it was like magic.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;d heard about it for years. Finally bought some and YES it performs as promised. Love the way it brings out my natural curl.</li>
    <li> It was on time forms vacation, as I was a little late getting it ordered.  Will be using this again</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair, this whole line is a must! I have had curly hair and by curly, I mean frizzy and large, this whole line has taken that all away! I now love my hair and it is now in real ringlets! My tip though is going to the deva website so that you can use the products properly. The only thing is I didn&#x27;t realize how small the bottles where. I will be ordering the bigger ones next time</li>
    <li> So I totally confused this product. On the picture the bottles look super big but HEY!!! They are only 12 oz haha When I received the bottles I was feeling blehh but I still absolutely love the product. I definitely recommend to all my curly hair family out there. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I love the Deva Curl line, but this is NOT the same product that is sold in salons. The shampoo was so thick it barely came out of the bottle, the conditioner is so runny you&#x27;re lucky if half what you put in your hands makes it to your head, and the gel doesn&#x27;t hold at all. DO NOT waste your money buying it from amazon, spend a little more to get the real stuff from a salon and you&#x27;ll be happier. The only reason why I even gave it one star is because it does make my hair soft (until it dries at least).</li>
    <li> Love it!! Works really well. My hair feels clean and not as frizzy as it is with other products. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> It is amazing for naturally curly hair. It has been exactly what I&#x27;ve been needing!!!</li>
    <li> It is enough to last about 5-6 months if you cleanse your hair daily or just once in a while. I love it. I will continue to order more and it has great quality and very great use for your curls. Plus it&#x27;s all organic. It smells so goooooood!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> excellent product,great for my hair.leaves it very soft and shinny</li>
    <li> This stuff has tamed a head of frizz to neater curls.</li>
    <li> not really, it didn&#x27;t fulfill my expectations..It was portrait as THE solution to curly hair..but it didnt work so fine to me...anyway...i guess that is i try some other variety, i may get better results.</li>
    <li> The best for all curl types!</li>
    <li> I am a recent convert to the whole no sulfate/alcohol ingredients in hair products craze.  I have coarse, curly hair, and DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner have made my hair so soft!  I always blow my hair out straight and used to have to put on a crème product after I towel dried my hair or else it would be frizzy and not be smooth.  But after using DevaCurl, I don&#x27;t need to do that extra step!  Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s a little weird getting used to the shampoo since it doesn&#x27;t lather at all and is like shampooing your hair with conditioner, but trust me, your hair gets clean.  Also like the smell, has a nice pepperminty scent.</li>
    <li> Good product. Can be used in combination with other hydrating products.</li>
    <li> LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
    <li> the conditioner does not moisture my hair as expected; on the other hand, the no poo is sooo good, i was affraid to leave the traditional shampoo, but the no poo leaves my sculp feeling fresh and my hair clean. the gel is light but holds my hair in place.</li>
    <li> I really like these products! They make my curls look so much more defined, springy, and soft. I would totally recommend this to anyone with wavy to natural hair. Deva is great.&lt;br /&gt;Next time though, I&#x27;m going to get the ultra gel- the light gel doesn&#x27;t quite have enough hold for my hair.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel greasy not fluffy like I anticipated. Weighed my hair down not allowing it to be curly</li>
    <li> I am new to this product. Have used it once and am amazed at the results.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with the smell of product.It does not smell like the real deva curl.</li>
    <li> I thought since they are used in salons, they would be very good, but my hair is very dry with the styling products. NOt very impressed.The seller was actually very good, exchanged he gel with the one I had expected without any problems.</li>
    <li> Having been a curly-top all of my life, and both suffering and enjoying the envy of most of my family and friends (suffering when I was younger and wanted spiked straight shocks of Joan Jett-style hair, enjoying when was older and had the cascading waves of curl that made me feel like a model) it was always a struggle to find a decent shampoo and conditioner that actually worked in the long-term. Products that worked wonderfully for a few weeks seemed to fizzle after extended use. After a time, I found that alternating between Paul Mitchell and Redken products designed for curls seemed to keep the frizz somewhat under control. My other problem was my unwillingness to spend hours every morning styling and shaping my hair, and my lack of ability at that particular task. I longed for something that enabled me to just run my hands through it and have it finished, no muss, no fuss. Well, DevaCurl has provided me with everything I always longed for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is non-foaming (hence the No-Poo title), which was a bit startling to use at first, but now seems much simpler and sensible. It actually seems at times that I can FEEL the benefits the shampoo is providing my hair. Ditto with the conditioner - this is a non-clinging, non-soupy-feeling solution that you can rinse off or leave in. And don&#x27;t get me STARTED on the An-Gel:  I do not have the vocabulary, time, or space to adequately describe how pleased I am with it. I simply take a bit in one hand, gently rub my hands together to prep, and scrunch it into my curls. A short while later, I fluff it out a bit, and I&#x27;m ready for the day! I can&#x27;t praise this line of product enough, and plan to be a devotee for a long while to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Having read this review, please keep in mind that yes, I am aware of the serious issues that affect our lives these days, and it seems frivolous to talk seriously about products that are meant to enhance your physical appearance. But come on, if you read this, you&#x27;re basically looking for something to help you look good, not a solution to world peace, right?)</li>
    <li> Best stuff for curly or wavy frizzy hair</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are my faves--very moisturizing, but they don&#x27;t weigh my hair down (med-very curly, not thick and fine).</li>
    <li> Funky smell and the gel left my hair sticky also why is there drying alcohol in both the shampoo and conditioner ?? Curly hair doesn&#x27;t like that :(</li>
    <li> Great products!  It keeps my wavy hair under control and in great condition, even in this hot and humid weather!</li>
    <li> The product did a great job for a few months. But eventually when winter hit it built up a weird oily residue on my hair that I couldn&#x27;t get out for the life of me. I loved what my hair looked like in the early days of using it though and wish they had a lighter line that I could use now.</li>
    <li> Good product I liked it but I wish I knew how to use it better. It seemed like my hair needed lots of the conditioner product. Maybe I needed to practice more or it needed clearer instructions. I will chalk it up to pilot error.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like devacurl products, as I have heard so many good things about it. But I have tried the line and wasn&#x27;t very happy with it. Left my hair dry and frizzy with no curl definition. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Love this trio! Deva is the only line I&#x27;ve been using for about 1.5 yrs now. My hair looks amazing! Curls are gorgeous and silky! Deva is the only way!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and liked it; the scent seems to have been reformulated.  The rose fragrance was so overpowering I had to wash my hair with regular shampoo to get it out.  Prior to this, the scent was delicate and pleasant.  I would use a fragrance-free option in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Exactly the same as the product found in stores. Item delivered on time, was as described in the ad.</li>
    <li> Does not do as advertised.  Very disapointed in product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Was expecting a lot more based on the reviews.</li>
    <li> Not great for wavy hair...maybe it works best for curly girls.  I don&#x27;t like the gel either....it&#x27;s sticky.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
