### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>GREAT SELLER!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a great deal now!</li>
      <li>Maybe this is not one of the best CHI.</li>
      <li>She mentioned that CHI is one of the best in quality in these products.</li>
      <li>this is the worlds best hair iron.</li>
      <li>It straightens my hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>Very good value for what it delivers.</li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>She just loved it.</li>
      <li>Does a fair job but not as good as one purchased through a beauty supply.  </li>
      <li>, she looks beautiful every time she uses it. :)</li>
      <li>Excellent quality and such a great value for the price.</li>
      <li>She loves it, but it would have been nice to have come with a thermal bag, for storage and carrying.</li>
      <li>it works fast and easy with the perfect hair that lasts all day and 2 days if you have to push it.</li>
      <li>Overall very impressed and pleased with the purchase!</li>
      <li>Bought this from Girl Shop and they provided fast friendly service for a great price!</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t quite seem to get as hot as a friend of mine&#x27;s who bought her Chi in a beauty store, but it still works great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Yay. :))))))))))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Definitely the best chi straightener that I have ever had.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to the Chi getting hotter and smoothing out my hair better.  </li>
      <li>Had a Chi that kicked the bucket after so many years.</li>
      <li>The CHI is ok, but it is not what it is hyped to be.  </li>
      <li>recommend this product for sure.</li>
      <li>Love my chi.</li>
      <li>The plastic handle needs to have more reinforcement on it.</li>
      <li>This one is just okay.  </li>
      <li>When they are new, they do work great.  </li>
      <li>Out dated model but still a fine product.</li>
      <li>but they were cheap and you can tell a huge difference with quality.  </li>
      <li>it wasnt cheap</li>
      <li>really cheap plastic and</li>
      <li>Plus it does not heat well and is not build well its flimsy and feels cheap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing like the original.</li>
      <li>That one broke after about 5 years, but I loved it and had to replace it with the exact same model.  </li>
      <li>Had to get the Chi again that really handles my hair just fine.</li>
      <li>It seems she was right</li>
      <li>I chose replace and within A DAY no hassles or paperwork, they issued a new shipment of the product to me and gave me the tracking number all with no annoying procedures.</li>
      <li>Straightener works good and heats up quick but ink on handles is rubbing off after third or fourth use.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think it gets as hot.</li>
      <li>The item came in sooner than expected which was nice, because I was able to check it out before I gave it to my sister, as a Christmas present.</li>
      <li>and it was most definitely a knock off item.</li>
      <li>My first one just stopped getting hot one day.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get really hot and you can&#x27;t control the temperature.</li>
      <li>I can NEVER get it to stay straight.</li>
      <li>or I&#x27;ll have to ask my father to return in and just get a real one from target.</li>
      <li>Does not burn the hair yet straightens very well.</li>
      <li>With this, my hair stays straight for about 3 days after I do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just like my old one only the price is better now.  </li>
      <li>I love this early Xmas present. !!!!</li>
      <li>And it isn&#x27;t aligned right and doesn&#x27;t completely close.</li>
      <li>This flat iron slides smoothly through the hair.  </li>
      <li>Kind of worried how long it will last</li>
      <li>it is worth the extra couple of dollars to have it do what it says it will.</li>
      <li>It goes through my hair so well takes all frizz and wave out of my hair makes my hair stay straight most of the day and doesn&#x27;t cause so much breakage to my hair like other flat irons.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The flat Iron did not work right out of the box.  </li>
      <li>The first one lasted about 5 years of daily use.</li>
      <li>The outside of it got hot but the plates did not.  </li>
      <li>My second one, somehow the one plate got pushed in funny which made it not line up right with the other plate.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, but so far I like the HSI much better than the CHI.</li>
      <li>It is lighter weight with a shorter cord than the professional ones</li>
      <li>Does not get hot enough, nothing like the last one I purchased....</li>
      <li>The logo isn&#x27;t a vibrant red but maroon.</li>
      <li>just wondering if i can please send back my chi for repairs or a new one or etc.</li>
      <li>It only takes a few strokes and your hair is silky smooth.</li>
      <li>but it finally gave out after nearly 4 years.</li>
      <li>My old one only broke when my husband stepped on it.</li>
      <li>Actually the product is a bit lighter than the old ones as well</li>
      <li>an it shouldnt stop working after less than a year.it did work very well then stopped!</li>
      <li>Received my product on time it was wrapped very carefully so thank you so much for that.</li>

    <li> I bought this to replace my last Chi that finally bit the dust.  That one broke after about 5 years, but I loved it and had to replace it with the exact same model.  I&#x27;ve tried other straighteners but they were cheap and you can tell a huge difference with quality.  The price has come down quite a bit, too, since I bought one 5 years ago.  It&#x27;s really a great deal now!</li>
    <li> Just like my old one only the price is better now.  Actually the product is a bit lighter than the old ones as well, I&#x27;m hoping it doesn&#x27;t mean it breaks faster since the last one lasted ~10yrs</li>
    <li> just wondering if i can please send back my chi for repairs or a new one or etc. it wasnt cheap an it shouldnt stop working after less than a year.it did work very well then stopped!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift after my last chi died. I opened the box and k ew instantly that this didn&#x27;t look the same. There was no warranty, no plastic etc. The logo isn&#x27;t a vibrant red but maroon. And it isn&#x27;t aligned right and doesn&#x27;t completely close. I hope that it at least works or I&#x27;ll have to ask my father to return in and just get a real one from target.</li>
    <li> this is the worlds best hair iron. it works fast and easy with the perfect hair that lasts all day and 2 days if you have to push it. it is worth the extra couple of dollars to have it do what it says it will.</li>
    <li> Received on time, but doesn&#x27;t heat up. I need to return the flat iron. It&#x27;s a knock off chi and not a quality item.</li>
    <li> Does a fair job but not as good as one purchased through a beauty supply.  It is lighter weight with a shorter cord than the professional ones and I don&#x27;t think it gets as hot.</li>
    <li> Bought this from Girl Shop and they provided fast friendly service for a great price! Sadly when I tried the product it was defective. I emailed them and they personally responded within a few hours, and offered to replace or refund me. I chose replace and within A DAY no hassles or paperwork, they issued a new shipment of the product to me and gave me the tracking number all with no annoying procedures. GREAT SELLER!</li>
    <li> Chi does a the job asked of it. It&#x27;s my wifes 3rd one. They seem to break in the middle at the ceramic and plastic point after a year or 2, this will be her last one. The plastic handle needs to have more reinforcement on it.</li>
    <li> The item came in sooner than expected which was nice, because I was able to check it out before I gave it to my sister, as a Christmas present. She loves it, but it would have been nice to have come with a thermal bag, for storage and carrying. Overall very impressed and pleased with the purchase!</li>
    <li> its a fake. It&#x27;s nothing like the original. really cheap plastic and the buttons are different. I sent it back.</li>
    <li> Had a Chi that kicked the bucket after so many years. Tried a few off brands which did not do the trick for me givenmy thick hair. Had to get the Chi again that really handles my hair just fine. Highly recommanded if you have thick hair!!</li>
    <li> It was advertised as new and the box is taped and looks like it was used or at least opened and taped back up with masking tape. ~ It is a gift for my daughter and the box looks like I bought it used. I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s not the case and it works.!</li>
    <li> I love this early Xmas present. !!!! It straightens my hair perfectly. I didn&#x27;t think the &amp;#34;Chi&amp;#34; designation would make such a big deal, what with all the talk of ions flying around and such. However, it does seem to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I had a non-ionic straightener, and the straightening job would last for one day. With this, my hair stays straight for about 3 days after I do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin, prone to wavy, blonde hair. I can NEVER get it to stay straight. It goes super curly all over my head overnight, and then dumb little waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay. :))))))))))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!! Doesn&#x27;t work ... Looks fake n it was broken how can I return it ? I still have the box</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not pleased with this product.  I&#x27;m used to the Chi getting hotter and smoothing out my hair better.  This seems to be a knock-off.</li>
    <li> Straightener works good and heats up quick but ink on handles is rubbing off after third or fourth use. Kind of worried how long it will last</li>
    <li> Have been unsing product for years. this is my second one. lasts a while, but does pull hair at times</li>
    <li> This flat iron slides smoothly through the hair.  It only takes a few strokes and your hair is silky smooth.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t quite seem to get as hot as a friend of mine&#x27;s who bought her Chi in a beauty store, but it still works great.</li>
    <li> Does not burn the hair yet straightens very well. Very good value for what it delivers. I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and such a great value for the price. Definitely the best chi straightener that I have ever had.</li>
    <li> This was a horrible product in my opinion. It did not do anything for my hair and the grip on the hair was not good.</li>
    <li> Extremely upset. This was a gift to my Sister and she got the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t heat well at all so it was her first clue that something was wrong. Then come to find out we looked it up and it was most definitely a knock off item. Extremely disappointed in Amazon for selling a product like this and for the price....Please save yourself the trouble and do not purchase this item. Do not support the people selling these items. Plus it does not heat well and is not build well its flimsy and feels cheap.</li>
    <li> It goes through my hair so well takes all frizz and wave out of my hair makes my hair stay straight most of the day and doesn&#x27;t cause so much breakage to my hair like other flat irons.</li>
    <li> I have not had luck with CHI flat irons.  They don&#x27;t seem to last.  My first one just stopped getting hot one day.  My second one, somehow the one plate got pushed in funny which made it not line up right with the other plate.  That would make my hair get caught in it and pulled out.  Not fun.  They&#x27;re too expensive to have to constantly be replacing them.  When they are new, they do work great.  I recently bought an HSI flat iron from Amazon.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, but so far I like the HSI much better than the CHI.</li>
    <li> I bought a Chi and it lasted 8 years.  Just bought another (same exact one) and its HORRIBLE! Does not get hot enough, nothing like the last one I purchased.... Returned it</li>
    <li> This is my second one I bought.  The first one lasted about 5 years of daily use. Out dated model but still a fine product. Great price. Received it within 3 days.</li>
    <li> The flat Iron did not work right out of the box.  The outside of it got hot but the plates did not.  In the process of returning it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had this same flat iron but it finally gave out after nearly 4 years. I am hoping this one last just as long or longer. Received my product on time it was wrapped very carefully so thank you so much for that.</li>
    <li> Love my chi. Can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for sure. It&#x27;s my 2nd one. My old one only broke when my husband stepped on it.</li>
    <li> The CHI is ok, but it is not what it is hyped to be.  Maybe this is not one of the best CHI. I was dissapointed.</li>
    <li> This one is just okay.  It doesn&#x27;t get really hot and you can&#x27;t control the temperature. It does the job.</li>
    <li> She just loved it. She mentioned that CHI is one of the best in quality in these products. It seems she was right, she looks beautiful every time she uses it. :)</li>
