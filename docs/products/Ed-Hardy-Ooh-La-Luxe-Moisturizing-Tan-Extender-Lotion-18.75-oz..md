      <li>but it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
      <li>i recently had a tattoo done and it seems to also bring out the color in my older ones also..</li>
      <li>but this lotion works like no other</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say whether or not it really does extend the life of your tan, but I like it so far.</li>

    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel. The scent could be better, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Loved this!!! The smell is awesome.</li>
    <li> I bought this because i love Ed Hardy&#x27;s Hollywood Bronze have been using it since debut in 2011. So i figured with a recent order id get this as well. Does what its advertised for, which is moisturize and help keep your tan. The smell is kinda perfumy and kinda flowery so i get a very unique smell using both this and Hollywood Bronze. as my one thing i would would be the slight sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> I am a year round tanner, I&#x27;ve tried MANY of the expensive tan extending moisturizers and this is BY FAR the best!! Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out AND keeps my tan glowing!!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells much better than the first Ed Hardy after tan lotion I bought. It works great! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Smells good. And very moisturizing!</li>
    <li> This lotion feels good on my skin, moisturizing but not to heavy. It does smell very sweet though, so be aware if you don&#x27;t like sweet smells. It smells just like gardenias. If you&#x27;ve ever smelled a fresh gardenia flower then you&#x27;ve smelled this lotion. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say whether or not it really does extend the life of your tan, but I like it so far.</li>

    <li> Makes my skin extremely soft. And smells good. Has a floral scent but it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I have tried every different moisturizer you can think of and this is by far my favorite ever. And it smells amazing! It isn&#x27;t oily or too heavy. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Best after tan lotion ever!</li>
    <li> Great tanning extender, smells awesome. I can tell it works. Reasonable price for this item and was received on time.</li>
    <li> This says it has silicone but it does not have that silky feel that my other silicone lotions have.  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for about a month now. My main reason for purchasing it was for the tan extender, however I have also noticed my skin is firmer &amp; is silky soft! It doesn&#x27;t feel like other silicon lotions I&#x27;ve used, but it does work like one! The scent is a light floral one &amp; is not overpowering. Definitely a lotion I&#x27;ll consider buying again.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, I have used it not only in the tanning bed but also when floating on the river and my skin feels so soft</li>
    <li> My wife Said that its ok. Not the best but good for its price. Smells decent. It is kinda watery.</li>
    <li> i love the smell, prevents peeling and keeps my skin so soft! i have dry skin but this lotion works like no other did for me!</li>
    <li> Good lotion but I personally don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> THis stuff is great, even for face! not too greasy!</li>
    <li> I wanted to get a lotion that really does what it is suppose to, and this one might, but I can&#x27;t stand the smell of it. It would be okay it I was only applying a little bit, but I put it all over and I don&#x27;t like smelling like a walking floral shop.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion ever.</li>
