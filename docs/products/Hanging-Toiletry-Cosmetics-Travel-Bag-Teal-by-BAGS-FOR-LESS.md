      <li>Cheap bag.</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>

      <li>I can fit full lotion, shampoo, hairspray bottles.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it !</li>
      <li>okay I was looking for a large makeup bag .</li>
      <li>It has the pockets on top plus it&#x27;s still a large make up bag on the bottom .</li>
      <li>Although I would not call this a high quality bag (which I did not expect for $11.99), I would say that it provides everything that I expected - great, roll-up storage to keep my products separated, while also keeping everything in one easy-to-travel-with area!  </li>
      <li>The bag came very quickly and I appreciated that.</li>
      <li>Very durable bag for an affordable price!!</li>
      <li>To be honest the picture doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ll hold enough but for $11</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as practical as my old -- no longer available -- very sturdy bag that accompanied me for many years.</li>
      <li>Another great cosmetics/toiletry bag from Bags for Less!  </li>
      <li>I think, though, compared to other items I looked at for the price I got a really good deal.  </li>
      <li>YOU CAN FIT A LOT OF THINGS INTO IT AND STILL BE ABLE TO CLOSE IT UP WITH THE VELCRO CLOSURE,  I ALSO PURCHASED THESE HARD PLASTIC HOOKS TO GO WITH IT AND WAS ABLE TO HANG IT FROM A DOOR.  </li>
      <li>The clear vinyl compartments make it easy to see what I have.</li>
      <li>With two women in a tiny stateroom this was perfect to hang and took very little space.p</li>
      <li>I use this for all of my first aid supplies.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon !</li>
      <li>Exactly two weeks in</li>
      <li>but you pretty much get what you pay for.  </li>
      <li>fits pretty much everything that I need to pack in a toiletry pack.  </li>
      <li>Bag is really good for a small amount of materials.</li>
      <li>This is very roomy and yet collapsible in a suitcase if you don&#x27;t have that much stuff.</li>
      <li>She used it on a cruise and said it was really helpful in organizing her makeup.</li>
      <li>So much room.</li>
      <li>REALLY WORKED</li>
      <li>I really like this bag</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very durable.  </li>
      <li>comes in handy for small getaways.</li>
      <li>Vibrant color and durable material.</li>
      <li>but it could be improved if they would have added something to the little metal hanging loop at the top.</li>
      <li>The bigger compartment isn&#x27;t huge but in my opinion just enough since I will have my make up in a makeup pouch.</li>
      <li>Seems like a decent amount so far...</li>
      <li>bag will not velcro when you fill the main pocket really full, along with things in the other pockets.  </li>
      <li>Love the product, do not love the fact that it came with no hook.</li>
      <li>once full of my stuff it didn&#x27;t roll and Velcro closed without rearranging and omitting some things</li>
      <li>I love the separate compartments so that I can separate wet and dry and make up from toiletries.  </li>
      <li>You NEED the clear plastic lining to see what you have.  </li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve been trying to test how much I can pack in the smaller compartments before I can&#x27;t close it.  </li>
      <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me as every place I have gone so far</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just used this for a two week trip and it worked out well. I like the idea of being able to hang up everything in the bathroom. I would add a hook to this setup so you hang it from a door or even the bathroom mirror. We used a suction cut hook for ten days and it worked well.</li>
    <li> Everything i hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Very nice and spacious, the bottom pouch holds a lot and the compartment zippers all worked. My only complaint is that the top is just a loop and not a hook you could use when traveling on a towel rack or something similar.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this type of bag for a long time, however, in stores I couldn&#x27;t find anything similar. I did find one toiletry bag but it was a lot smaller than this one.&lt;br /&gt;I think this one is great because it has a lot of space to fit your cosmetics.</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s holding up, although it&#x27;s a bit flimsy. It&#x27;s as practical as my old -- no longer available -- very sturdy bag that accompanied me for many years.</li>
    <li> Wife likes it.  It holds all she needs and makes it easier when she travels.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter loved this . Perfect for her as taking a trip. Wish it came with travel size bottles</li>
    <li> The toiletry cosmetics travel bag has plenty of compartments, easy to use, like the way it folded. Wish it had a hanger.</li>
    <li> I love this bag. I used it last weekend and it is perfect for one person. Now I need another one ! Thanks Amazon !</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact that there is no hook, look carefully before purchase!</li>
    <li> Love This bag. Perfect for bathroom and traveling!</li>
    <li> This is very roomy and yet collapsible in a suitcase if you don&#x27;t have that much stuff. I can even put a small hair dryer in it. I tied a string (cut from sweat pants) on the top so I can hang it on a door knob or tie it to a towel rack. It would be good if it came with a tie so you wouldn&#x27;t have to go hunt for one.</li>
    <li> Great bag.  It fits quite a bit of stuff.  It&#x27;s very durable.  Even with packing it tight I haven&#x27;t had any problems with seams or fabric wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag will not velcro when you fill the main pocket really full, along with things in the other pockets.  Also, the clear pockets line up a little awkwardly with the bag, making them not able to hold as much as you think they should.  It doesn&#x27;t have a hook, but I grabbed a little binder ring to put on for hooking it places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a workable functional bag.</li>
    <li> Another great cosmetics/toiletry bag from Bags for Less!  Although I would not call this a high quality bag (which I did not expect for $11.99), I would say that it provides everything that I expected - great, roll-up storage to keep my products separated, while also keeping everything in one easy-to-travel-with area!  The color is really great too!  I&#x27;ll definitely be using this one as a back-up to the previous hanging toiletry bag purchased from Bags for Less.  I received this product in exchange for my honest review and have no complaints!</li>
    <li> its just what  I needed for travel,big enough for my stuff and folds up small when not in use and I love the color</li>
    <li> So, this comes without a hanging hook!! Not sure what that is all about, but I had to buy a hook for it. Slightly annoyed...</li>
    <li> I gave these to my mom and daughter-in-law who don&#x27;t travel far, but have several overnights throughout the year. They seemed to like them. My mom is coming to stay in a few weeks and I&#x27;ll get her unbiased opinion then.</li>
    <li> Many uses to make travel and living out of a suitcase easier.</li>
    <li> fits pretty much everything that I need to pack in a toiletry pack.  Zippers have lasted and easy to clean up.  Have taken it on 5 airline trips and has worked well.  Fits perfectly in luggage or carry on bag.</li>
    <li> This is an ok product for the price.  It&#x27;s smaller than I thought it would be.  The materials less expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great bag for traveling- it rolls-up so packing is easy; waterproof in case of a leak; big compartment for larger items and smaller zip-closure pockets for smaller items. AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> Had this bag for a few months now and it&#x27;s holding up very nicely! Like that there are several compartments and can hold A LOT of stuff. It&#x27;s great for traveling and love that you have the option to hang it. Very durable bag for an affordable price!!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful item and I like the different pockets but it is tearing after just a few days of use. Exactly two weeks in and it is tearing as a result of hanging.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Great size for heading home from college.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and it was delivered directly to her.  She used it on a cruise and said it was really helpful in organizing her makeup.</li>
    <li> Great travel case. So much room. I can fit full lotion, shampoo, hairspray bottles. It worked great for the 7 day cruise I got it for.</li>
    <li> The bag was smaller than expected and made of cheaper plastic material that I do not feel will hold up well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cosmetic bag like this and I am really happy with it. I like all the compartments. The bottom bag holds a lot of odds and ends. The clear vinyl compartments make it easy to see what I have.</li>
    <li> I M very happy with this purchase. I love the color and the size accommodates everything I need for a weekend trip or a 10 day trip.  I felt the amount I paid for it could not have been matched anywhere else.</li>
    <li> okay I was looking for a large makeup bag . I&#x27;m 19 I&#x27;m young I use a lot of products . Everyone else wanted $22- $30 for a bag , I&#x27;m not wasting my money on a simple bag until I stumbled across this one I kept looking at it &amp; going back and forth . To be honest the picture doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ll hold enough but for $11 plus it came in my favorite color turquoise I thought why not . I made the best decision ever ! It has the pockets on top plus it&#x27;s still a large make up bag on the bottom . I have 50 brushes , 10 false eyelashes boxes, 2 foundation bottles, compact , elf setting spray bottle and still have room in the bottom bag plus still room to fill out the ones above . The best part you can stuff as much as you want and it still fold up into a perfect square or when I&#x27;m on vacation hang it up on the wall . You must get this ! It&#x27;s worth it !</li>
    <li> When traveling organization is key and this bag should do the trick.  You NEED the clear plastic lining to see what you have.  You can also hang it up which will take less counter space in a hotel.  The bag came very quickly and I appreciated that.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> This is a  great cosmetic travel bag, Compact but great on space. Made of quality materials and wipe able as well.</li>
    <li> The bag is okay but it could be improved if they would have added something to the little metal hanging loop at the top. I&#x27;ll have to do a make-shift thing in order to hang it in the bathroom when traveling. The price and size is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great size and material quality was good.</li>
    <li> I love this bag. You can fit a lot into it, and it folds very nicely for packing. I was tired of packing multiple toiletry bags for one trip.</li>
    <li> Was sooo excited for this bag...just received it and while i was packing my makeup i realised the thread was unravelling and there was a hole. Sigh! So disappointed!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product, do not love the fact that it came with no hook. Hotels do not provide hooks.  So now I&#x27;m on the hunt fora hanging hook to add to the bag.</li>
    <li> It worked. None of the zippers or seams have broken. Plenty of space to bring what you need and several compartments to organize your stuff. I like the see through pockets so I don&#x27;t have to guess what is in them.</li>
    <li> Runs a little small, but it does the job. The big compartment on the bottom is the only compartment worth putting anything in it. The other compartments can only fit like a toothbrush, travel size toothpaste, or lipstick.</li>
    <li> Nice bag! I use this for all of my first aid supplies. The material is ok, but the price is great.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter to go to summer camp and it worked perfectly for her!</li>
    <li> I bought this from Amazon to take on a cruise.  With two women in a tiny stateroom this was perfect to hang and took very little space.p</li>
    <li> Cheap bag. No hook and zipper broken.</li>
    <li> If your rough on it at all, it will get small holes on the fabric.</li>
    <li> Bag is really good for a small amount of materials. I wasn&#x27;t able to roll it with a lot of makeup brushes byt ut comes in handy for small getaways.</li>
    <li> VELCRO DOES NOT CLOSE GOOD</li>
    <li> This bag is great for the gym or travel.  I love the separate compartments so that I can separate wet and dry and make up from toiletries.  It isn&#x27;t the highest quality but I don&#x27;t travel often so it won&#x27;t get a lot of use.  I also use it camping so I just wanted something inexpensive that worked for that.  I think, though, compared to other items I looked at for the price I got a really good deal.  The only thing I did not like that other reviews also noted was that there is no hook for hanging it up only a small ring.  So far it hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me as every place I have gone so far has had a small enough hook to hang it on but I agree most hotels don&#x27;t so it might be good to get a hook you could attach to the ring in case.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Holds lots of stuff.</li>
    <li> If you travel a lot like I do then you need a bag that will hold all your items in 1 small bag. This is it</li>
    <li> I was doubtful about this product because most products like this have multiple compartments but lack space to fit bulkier items. The bag at the bottom creates room for my makeup, lotion and other smaller items that wont fit into the flat compartments. Vibrant color and durable material. Great value.</li>
    <li> The concept is good. Color is good, but the quality isn&#x27;t that great. You get what you pay for, but I didn&#x27;t think Amazon would allow this quality of product to be sold by them</li>
    <li> I love it, but the inner lining broke a few months I had it.</li>
    <li> I TOOK THIS CASE WITH ME ON A TRIP. I PLACED ALL MY MAKEUP IN IT, MY COMBS AND BRUSHES, Q-TIPS, TOOTHBRUSH/PASTE ETC. YOU CAN FIT A LOT OF THINGS INTO IT AND STILL BE ABLE TO CLOSE IT UP WITH THE VELCRO CLOSURE,  I ALSO PURCHASED THESE HARD PLASTIC HOOKS TO GO WITH IT AND WAS ABLE TO HANG IT FROM A DOOR.  REALLY WORKED WELL.</li>
    <li> I really like this bag but you pretty much get what you pay for.  The material is a little thin and the stitching may not be so great but I like the design.  So far I&#x27;ve been trying to test how much I can pack in the smaller compartments before I can&#x27;t close it.  Seems like a decent amount so far...miniture bodywashes &amp; luffa, next pouch contact solution mini bottle and face wipes, and the last which is much smaller, jewlery.  The bigger compartment isn&#x27;t huge but in my opinion just enough since I will have my make up in a makeup pouch. In the bigger compartment I&#x27;ve already put minuture travel bottles for some shampoos and conditioners. I&#x27;ve tried to hang it up already by using a hanger (since it doesn&#x27;t have a hanger of it&#x27;s own) and it seemed successful. My trip is in March so I haven&#x27;t put it to the test...so far so good. If I could give it a 3.5 I would.</li>
    <li> I used this on a trip and it was a bit of a transition from my old travel bag that I wore out. Change is hard. I think this will work but it is not the same. I don&#x27;t think my old one is still made and this was the best I could find to replace it.</li>
    <li> I love the travel bag....but I was very disappointed that it only had a loop and NO hook to hang up on a door.&lt;br /&gt;The hook is great to hanging on drawers ect.  It is currently sitting on my floor because I usually hang my old travel bag on my bathroom door.  That is the only reason for the low score.</li>
    <li> once full of my stuff it didn&#x27;t roll and Velcro closed without rearranging and omitting some things</li>
    <li> Good size to fit all my toiletries in....</li>
</ol>
