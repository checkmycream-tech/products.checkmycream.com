      <li>I tried this color at a nice Salon near my house and liked it so much that I purchased it online..</li>
      <li>It is very vampy and intense, but it is such a beautiful, warm bronze.</li>
      <li>The quality of the product itself is great which is to be expected from OPI.</li>
      <li>This color is very pretty</li>
      <li>It is very fine and is only noticeable when your hand reflects the light.</li>
      <li>I used this color at the manicurist and its exactly the color I would imagine!  </li>
      <li>Hard to find I most stores, but is amazing</li>
      <li>This is very close and it has an added bit of red glitter which adds depth and is quite nice.</li>

      <li>The gold shimmer doesn&#x27;t show up as much on your nails as it does in the bottle</li>
      <li>Every other polish I&#x27;ve used has worn better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This color is deep, rich, and vampy.</li>
      <li>When it was dry it looked a little more maroon than brown &amp; was just lovely.</li>
      <li>color has a blackish base that dries into the most devilishly wonderful, rich, deep red imaginable.</li>
      <li>Color is phenomenal, dark reddish brown.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t use it at that time since we were at the beach, but came home and ordered it for my new fall color.</li>
      <li>I had it on the past week with a gold color &amp; got so many compliments.  </li>
      <li>A little burnt orange-like shimmer in the light.</li>
      <li>Classy color..</li>
      <li>I love the deep bronze color....not waiting for fall, I&#x27;ll wear it all year round!  </li>
      <li>Their polishes are pretty and very long lasting.</li>
      <li>I usually go for soft pretty neutrals.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone to bed with touched up chips and had new ones on other nails in the morning.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s not glitter like typical glitter polish.  </li>
<li> For me a little dark for summer, but I wear it almost exclusively in the cooler months.</li>
<li> It went smoothly &amp; only needed two thin coats.  </li>
<li> My manicurist suggested this color to me a few molnths ago</li>
<li> Love the color, hate the chipping!</li>
<li> They haven&#x27;t made that color since like 2008 and it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
<li> Its base is brown, but it has deep red-coppery highlights and a pearly finish.</li>
<li> It was completely frustrating.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this polish a couple yrs.. One of my favs.. It&#x27;s a great fall color.. However in the summer this color is very nice in the sun.. the undertone sparkles and dances in the the sun..rich..  Very fun.. Classy color.. Stays on great!</li>
    <li> love the color sparkly very pretty</li>
    <li> Found this color while on vacation. Didn&#x27;t use it at that time since we were at the beach, but came home and ordered it for my new fall color.</li>
    <li> I usually go for soft pretty neutrals. Bought this for my daughter, kept looking at the bottle--the color was so pretty I had to open and try. Purchasing another bottle today for daughters Christmas sock. The gold shimmer doesn&#x27;t show up as much on your nails as it does in the bottle but I still like it for glam days of holidays.</li>
    <li> Great color that goes on well and also lasts well. Looks great for the fall season.  Nice shimmer!  Wearing it for a second fall season!</li>
    <li> Awesome color &amp; wears very well.  Received may compliments on the color</li>
    <li> This color is deep, rich, and vampy. It is the perfect fall/winter nail color. I am so in love :)</li>
    <li> I love the deep bronze color....not waiting for fall, I&#x27;ll wear it all year round!  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> This is a rich, gorgeous color. You really can almost never go wrong with OPI. Their polishes are pretty and very long lasting. I recently had a home manicure with an OPI polish last two weeks w/ only two touch ups.</li>
    <li> beautiful color and has made my nails look wonderful.  Exactly what I was looking for.  will buy again. Thank you</li>
    <li> Color is phenomenal, dark reddish brown.  It goes great with everything from fall to spring, very formal looking.  For me a little dark for summer, but I wear it almost exclusively in the cooler months.</li>
    <li> This color is very pretty but I did expect it to be more brown. To me it seems very red with a hint of brown. It will look great for the autumn season though.</li>
    <li> I bought this color accidentally but I love this color. A little burnt orange-like shimmer in the light. Very similar to &amp;#34;Every Month Is Oktoberfest&amp;#34; but not as purple. Beautiful color overall.</li>
    <li> Love the color, hate the chipping! I have about 40 O.P.I. polishes because I think it&#x27;s one of the best polishes ever. However, as much as I absolutely LOVE this color, it started chipping within hours of application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a base coat, two coats of polish, and a top coat. I&#x27;ve gone to bed with touched up chips and had new ones on other nails in the morning. Every other polish I&#x27;ve used has worn better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carried the bottle with me in my purse during a recent trip so that I could continually patch chips. It was completely frustrating. I will probably try to use it over another color for stability and then with a glitter top coat.</li>
    <li> My manicurist suggested this color to me a few molnths ago and I almost didn&#x27;t go with it because it was so dark.  But I gave in and immediately loved it!  Have been wearing it ever since, but when I asked him to get me a bottle for home touch-ups, he couldn&#x27;t get it because it was discontinued. Glad I found it at Amazon.  If you like it, grab it now.</li>
    <li> Great color, and OPI is the best nail polish brand ever.</li>
    <li> I used this color at the manicurist and its exactly the color I would imagine!  I love it and use it all the time ... like today.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t your basic red. Nor is it your basic maroon. Or brown. ...it IS just a great, universally flattering tone that is a definite go to for a polished look. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on this shade...and can say that, yes it looks maroon or red in the image but there are brown and purple undertones. Hard to describe, but definitely one of those shades that you&#x27;ll search for after it&#x27;s discontinued. Stock up now...not a one time try.</li>
    <li> This is an interesting color.  The bottle on the screen appears to be a purplish color but that is not correct at all.  This is a deep maroon color with gold flecks of glitter.  It&#x27;s not glitter like typical glitter polish.  It is very fine and is only noticeable when your hand reflects the light. I would recommend this color to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this color, especially in the daylight.  Its base is brown, but it has deep red-coppery highlights and a pearly finish. Really rich. Makes me keep looking at my nails, it&#x27;s such a yummy color.</li>
    <li> Ordered this color fell in love with it. Not only was it delivered promptly, it was exactly the shade I expected with a good price attached.</li>
    <li> I tried this color at a nice Salon near my house and liked it so much that I purchased it online..as usual, OPI nail polish lasts longer and has very trendy colors.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my favorite color, royal rajah ruby. They haven&#x27;t made that color since like 2008 and it&#x27;s hard to find. This is very close and it has an added bit of red glitter which adds depth and is quite nice. The price was amazing for any OPI product. Shipping was very fast and packaging was thorough. The quality of the product itself is great which is to be expected from OPI. Long lasting, beautiful color as always.</li>

It went smoothly &amp; only needed two thin coats.  When it was dry it looked a little more maroon than brown &amp; was just lovely.</li>
    <li> My very favorite winter color.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, nice and shiny, wears well.  Makes a great addition to anyone&#x27;s polish collection!</li>
    <li> Hard to find I most stores, but is amazing</li>
    <li> Deep, rich, claret color with the perfect amount of glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color has a blackish base that dries into the most devilishly wonderful, rich, deep red imaginable. Vampy, glamorous , wonderful. The color seems to glow from the inside out!</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely perfect Fall/Winter color!! It is very vampy and intense, but it is such a beautiful, warm bronze. It looks so chic and sophisticated and has beautiful copper and red undertones. It doesn&#x27;t look goth at all. Makes me think of the leaves changing color. LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> love the color - great for fall or fun accent nails.  Great formula and last a week on me!</li>
