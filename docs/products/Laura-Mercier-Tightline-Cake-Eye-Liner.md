      <li>Works perfectly for me.</li>
      <li>Always good!</li>
      <li>The product meets the need, creates a beautiful tight-lined lash look.</li>
      <li>it is easy to use (and my makeup skills are not the best) and is good quality.</li>
      <li>I use an angled brush as well, that&#x27;s also good to note.  </li>
      <li>I love this liner!</li>
      <li>Love this liner with a Sigma E15 brush!</li>
      <li>Love the cake eye liner!  </li>
      <li>Very happy with this liner and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Works nicely, gets on the lower lash line though...</li>
      <li>You definitley need the right brush to apply correctly but this is an amazing liner!</li>
      <li>Drug store cake liners are much better.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>But what a wonderful product if you use properly.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Love all Laura Mercier items.</li>
      <li>so pleased .and</li>
      <li>My eye now has definition and more drama without taking away space from my eyelid.  </li>
      <li>I am really pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>It still is my favorite eyeliner though...</li>
      <li>I bought the pro flat definer brush and it works perfect.</li>
      <li>I am happy with this and recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>The color is perfect and it lasts a long time!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice, but it is the first cake eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Until then, yes, this is a good product, you get what you pay for (kinda) in the sense that you&#x27;ll get the lovely achieved look of tight-lined eyes that will last most of the day</li>
      <li>It always looks great, doesnt flake off or transfer to my upper lid.  </li>
      <li>VERY OVER PRICED!!!</li>
      <li>The convenience of ordering and getting exactly what I want is so important to me.</li>
      <li>And the vendor makeupmall shipped very fast!</li>
      <li>Beautiful deep vivid color.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is great, with a little mirror inside.  </li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite eye liner .  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different eyeliners and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>but it is a wee bit overpriced for something with talc listed as the first ingredient.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product</li>
      <li>Exactly how it was presented</li>
      <li>Purchased it first in 2010 and just ran out.  </li>
      <li>They shipped it in this ridiculously large box - free-floating.</li>
      <li>so try not to sweat too much or cry while wearing this.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>You really need to work the color into a paste.  </li>
      <li>After reading so many reviews, I bought first the black and then the plum color.</li>
      <li>I can see using this for a long time, but honestly if something cheaper of similar quality comes along I would be tempted to try it.</li>
      <li>It seems to last longer than most eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried to achieve the same look, but again this isn&#x27;t a liner so much as filling in the lash gaps.</li>
      <li>Would not recommend for older people.</li>
      <li>Laura Mercier has discontinued the main ingredient to this duo - the Tightline Activator liquid.  </li>
      <li>i love this tight liner.</li>
      <li>Goes on very smoothly and last a long time.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money...</li>
      <li>Kind of thin texture.</li>
      <li>The black is nice and dark and it does not fade nor run after all day wear.</li>
      <li>You can do a simple tight line to make your eye lashes look thicker or make it bold for drama!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take very much to get a thin clean line on my eyelids.  </li>
      <li>but it lasts sooooo long that price per use is actually pretty low.  </li>
      <li>No other compares.</li>
      <li>It will rub off if your eyes water but generally doesnt run off.</li>
      <li>but I do find it is easly to make thin line on top &amp; bottom of eye.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was a little pricey at first</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love the cake eye liner!  It always looks great, doesnt flake off or transfer to my upper lid.  It will rub off if your eyes water but generally doesnt run off.</li>
    <li> Love it. Exactly how it was presented</li>
    <li> Love this product. Goes on very smoothly and last a long time. I&#x27;ve tried several different eyeliners and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Kind of thin texture.</li>
    <li> Transfers to lower waterline, wish it stayed where i put it.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money...this product does not work!!!  Laura Mercier has discontinued the main ingredient to this duo - the Tightline Activator liquid.  Without the Tightline Activator liquid the cake eyeliner is useless - it does not work with water.</li>
    <li> i love this tight liner. it is easy to use (and my makeup skills are not the best) and is good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years.  Purchased it first in 2010 and just ran out.  Works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> Always good! Love this eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for tightlining! i use either a Sigma E15 or MAC 212 and it couldnt be easier.  The black is nice and dark and it does not fade nor run after all day wear. I thought it was a little pricey at first but it lasts sooooo long that price per use is actually pretty low.  And the vendor makeupmall shipped very fast!</li>
    <li> After reading so many reviews, I bought first the black and then the plum color. I am really pleased with the results.  My eye now has definition and more drama without taking away space from my eyelid.  I bought the brush that was suggested. You really need to work the color into a paste.  I use water only.  I was worried that my eyes would tear up but i have had no problems, even when I miss my mark and get some in my eye. I am happy with this and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Works nicely, gets on the lower lash line though... maybe I still have learning to do.</li>
    <li> Love this liner with a Sigma E15 brush!</li>
    <li> Perfect compact. Love all Laura Mercier items. You can do a simple tight line to make your eye lashes look thicker or make it bold for drama!</li>
    <li> Beautiful deep vivid color.  Only complaint is that it will run quite a bit if your eyes tear before it dries. I wear contacts and have had to take them out and redo the whole eye because I forgot and put a drop in my eye before the eyeliner dried. Will also run a bit if you sweat or cry...so try not to sweat too much or cry while wearing this.  It still is my favorite eyeliner though...you can&#x27;t beat the color.</li>
    <li> I love this liner! You definitley need the right brush to apply correctly but this is an amazing liner! I bought the pro flat definer brush and it works perfect. Very happy with this liner and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The product meets the need, creates a beautiful tight-lined lash look. It seems to last longer than most eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried to achieve the same look, but again this isn&#x27;t a liner so much as filling in the lash gaps. The diskette cake is about the size of a quarter. They shipped it in this ridiculously large box - free-floating. I&#x27;m amazed it didn&#x27;t get broken. I can see using this for a long time, but honestly if something cheaper of similar quality comes along I would be tempted to try it. Until then, yes, this is a good product, you get what you pay for (kinda) in the sense that you&#x27;ll get the lovely achieved look of tight-lined eyes that will last most of the day but it is a wee bit overpriced for something with talc listed as the first ingredient.</li>
    <li> The convenience of ordering and getting exactly what I want is so important to me. I&#x27;am so pleased .and will keep ordering from Amazon</li>
    <li> This eyeliner ran all over into my wrinkles above my eyes. Would not recommend for older people.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to try tight lining.  I ran home and tried it and ...tight lining does NOTHING for my eyes.  NOTHING.  I guess I have thick lashes and so I used it for normal-type eyeliner stuff.  It&#x27;s nice, but it is the first cake eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It took a few tries, and you can get a deep black if you use the right amount of water, and such.  I use an angled brush as well, that&#x27;s also good to note.  The packaging is great, with a little mirror inside.  It will last a long long time, and unlike other eyeliners, I don&#x27;t see this one getting dirty or gross, like gel liners sometimes do.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but I do find it is easly to make thin line on top &amp; bottom of eye.  Last all day.</li>
    <li> This cake liner is horrible!! Drug store cake liners are much better. I hate i paid this much for the eyeliner! It runs bad!!! It last about three hours and then faded away. It also runs into the creases of your lines. VERY OVER PRICED!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite eye liner .  No other compares. The color is perfect and it lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product and I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t take very much to get a thin clean line on my eyelids.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is tight line which needs the proper applicator to use properly. But what a wonderful product if you use properly. I will ALWAYS use this product forever.</li>
