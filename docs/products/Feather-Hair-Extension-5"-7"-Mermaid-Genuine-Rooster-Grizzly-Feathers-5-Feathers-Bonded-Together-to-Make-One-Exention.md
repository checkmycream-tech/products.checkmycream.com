      <li>dnt fade so fast .</li>
      <li>However the color faded out of them much too quickly - one week later there was noticeable color loss, and now after 12 days I am taking them out because the colors are almost gone.  </li>
      <li>Some of them said that the colors didn&#x27;t last long, but all of the colors were still vibrant at two weeks, except the bright blue.</li>

      <li>The light blue one faded to white like the 2nd day I washed my hair.  </li>
      <li>my hair is a little past my collar bones, and i love the length of them.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m bringing back hair feathers with these ;)&lt;br /&gt;Love the colors :)&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying more either&lt;br /&gt;Good price too!</li>
    <li> I love these feathers, they came with two beads, are able to be curled, and they stand out enough so people notice them.</li>
    <li> The description claims it has 5 feathers and mine only had one thin pink, one thin blue and a thin long brown one.  I followed a videa on YouTube and put them in correctly and you cannot even see them in my hair.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love these feathers! the quality is Great and they last over a month. each item you buy is ONE extension, so it&#x27;s kind of pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it with these feathers. i will DEF buy these feathers or ones like them again and again! :)</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM. they shipped super quick! i just bought 3 more packs from Sexy Sparkles. my hair is a little past my collar bones, and i love the length of them. if you have super long hair i would probably say get the longer ones available!</li>
    <li> The feathers are really pretty.  However they were alot thinner than what I thought they were going to be.  The light blue one faded to white like the 2nd day I washed my hair.  Other than that I liked them.  I also seperated them into 2 different extentions.</li>
    <li> i prefer Lucky feather heads feathers to these. The ends fray quickly. The feathers were uneven sizes. I would not recommend to a friend, sorry!</li>
    <li> I bought these in august, and i still have them in my hair. Definitely worth the price. And the colors were pretty :)</li>
    <li> These feathers were really pretty colors and I loved them.  However the color faded out of them much too quickly - one week later there was noticeable color loss, and now after 12 days I am taking them out because the colors are almost gone.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, but I suggest that you avoid applying heat if possible, it will cause the feather to fray/break faster and easier, clip it out of the way, for best option if using products or heat on hair, take it out.</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> When this was a fad my daughter loved putting these in her hair. Would recommend these for anyone who likes hair extensions.</li>
    <li> Loved the feathers, easy to use and to take out. Simple to save and reuse.</li>
    <li> WE LOVE EXTENSIONS.  THEY ARE FUN AND ADD A LOT TO YOUR HAIR.  THEY ADD COLOR AND BLING TO YOUR HAIR.  EVERYONE WANTS THEM AND THEY ARE GREAT FOR THE VALUE.</li>
    <li> I just got these in this afternoon, they are amazing. I love the colours that they came in. Not to mention the one natural Grizzly, so pretty. :D</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughters. They loved them. My wife even wore a few.</li>
    <li> Very nice colors thought they might be a little bigger but will put in grand daughters hair.&lt;br /&gt;She is 8 and my monster high fan.</li>

    <li> I got these for my daughter who has been bugging me for some hair feathers for a while. I read the reviews, and decided that for this price I would take the risk. Some of them said that the colors didn&#x27;t last long, but all of the colors were still vibrant at two weeks, except the bright blue. It faded a little. But for this price, they were GREAT! I would get them again.</li>
    <li> cool! very easy to put in and my sister loves them yay yay yay yay yay yay buy it blegh</li>
    <li> i got them beautiful and look great on my bang area would recommended ... i could treat it like my own hair and the feather color dnt fade so fast . thats a plus . Though the feathers come a little darker than whats show on the image but love them indeed..</li>
