      <li>I have dry curly hair and have been happy with Deva brand for years.</li>
      <li>So far I love my WEN!  </li>
      <li>its ok - i feel like it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair as much as i would like</li>
      <li>I have thick wavy hair and this product should be perfect for my hair type.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels really nice and soft to touch.</li>
      <li>I think it might be useful as a conditioner but for my hair type it doesnt work.</li>
      <li>Wife has always liked Wen products and this is no different.</li>
      <li>It is worth the cost.</li>
      <li>which I then had to go get it cut and start fresh</li>
      <li>They are really worth the money,.</li>
      <li>right at the end of the shower...</li>
      <li>Day one the product does offer benefits, but I found that it is not lastilast fresh smelling after the first day.</li>
      <li>though, I used it on my daughter who has a different hair type than me (very fine hair) and it made her hair greasy looking.  </li>
      <li>I love all the additional products it comes with, especially the Re-moist cleanser</li>
      <li>I love the Wen products and I&#x27;m sure I will never go back to regular type shampoo.</li>
      <li>So I bought after watching it on TV after the first use</li>
      <li>Did not have great results with this product, did not live up to expectations, next going to try &#x27;</li>
      <li>I have to say I tried this and noticed my hair was much softer, again with the first use.</li>
      <li>Good quality but too small amount for the money you pay.</li>
      <li>my hair would be tangled and feel very course, however from the first time I tried Wen (years ago) my hair felt silky smooth with no tangles or frizz and it smells terrific.</li>
      <li>My hair has looked so much healthier with the Wen products.</li>
      <li>The products I am using from this hair kit really work well.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really need.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about ready to just return it all.</li>
      <li>did not work any better than anything off the shelf, not worth the money</li>
      <li>I have found that you must definitely use cool water on your hair, otherwise it does leave your hair feeling greasy.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used the Wen products, my scalp felt nouished and my hair was actually soft.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo it dosen&#x27;t weight my hair down.</li>
      <li>the pump doesn&#x27;t work and I can&#x27;t figure out how to just get a new pump....</li>
      <li>Still in the beginning stages but so far it is a great shampoo, though it is really weird not having lather.</li>
      <li>I do wish the scent was a little stronger, it smells strong in the bottle</li>
      <li>I have read numerous not so flattering reviews about Wen products from other websites but take it from someone who has very thick naturally curly hair, this stuff is AWESOME!</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair that is layered a little below the shoulders.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s clearly 4 pieces.</li>
      <li>Just Natural&#x27; hair care.</li>
      <li>Wow my daughter has hair that tends toward oily and looses lots of hair.</li>
      <li>, my hair is amazingly soft and shiny after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Has made my dyed gray hair shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>I  am  over  50 years young  and living in  the  sunshine  state..</li>
      <li>Wow I will never go back to shampoo again.</li>
      <li>but I ordered from amazon and seems like it&#x27;s an old product I wish I can send back and get my money back</li>
      <li>I normally have to wash my hair every day, but when has allowed me to change to every other day.</li>
      <li>I have very curly, coarse Caucasian hair and have never not had tangles in it wet or dry.  </li>
      <li>Not only are the tangles gone - but from the first &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; my hair has felt like silk and calmed down 1000%!!</li>

<li> This is hard for a person who loves hot showers.</li>
<li> it made my hair look greasy and flat.</li>
<li> I have watched the Wen commercials for years, wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to try it.  </li>
<li> In the long run you save on conditioners and color lasts twice as long.</li>
<li> It makes your hair extremely greasy and flat.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it gets me lucky, so I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
<li> Not much is needed to make my hair softer and fuller.</li>
<li> spent 100.oo</li>
<li> I got what is shown but am curious what these supposed other 2 pieces are</li>
<li> Other products make it overly weighed down or dry and frizzy.</li>
<li> think I would have a really hard time going back after using this, cost or not.</li>
<li> wife&#x27;s only complaint was the price.</li>
<li> It is expensive and they require you to use (OVER use) too much product in each application.</li>
<li> Totally not worth the money.  </li>
<li> I have really thick and wavy coarse hair.  </li>
<li> My hair has less breakage and feels like silk.</li>
<li> Those I don&#x27;t use seem to be a little redundant</li>
<li> Dried out my ultra-fine curly hair.</li>
<li> When I was using shampoo (even with heavy conditioner)</li>
<li> If you haven&#x27;t ever tried Wen Products; you are missing out.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d so foreign to hair washing!!!,</li>
<li> My hair has transformed so soft no more bad hair days</li>
<li> It is rather costly but hard to argue with her results.</li>
<li> I was not thrilled about the product.</li>

    <li> its ok - i feel like it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair as much as i would like</li>
    <li> Love the product! Came in original packaging and price was great! :-)</li>
    <li> The products I am using from this hair kit really work well.  Those I don&#x27;t use seem to be a little redundant and I don&#x27;t really need.</li>
    <li> Still in the beginning stages but so far it is a great shampoo, though it is really weird not having lather. The lather is what makes me feel like I am getting it clean and healthy</li>
    <li> Leary of ordering miracle solutions cause they never work. Well this one did. I will never put shampoo in my hair again. It is worth the cost. In the long run you save on conditioners and color lasts twice as long. Try it and you&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> I was not thrilled about the product. After several uses, i need not see any difference in my hair over all especially per advertisement.</li>
    <li> I have never used Wen before, but I color my hair and the color never lasted with regular shampoo. So I bought after watching it on TV after the first use Wow I will never go back to shampoo again. My hair has transformed so soft no more bad hair days and my color has lasted . Wish I could give 10 stars!!</li>
    <li> Perfect product .My sister send it to me to Saudi Arabia It &#x27;s really work many thanks to my great sister and the wen company.....Amani</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.  She loved the scent and what it did for her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to follow the instructions which entails a wash, rinse, placement and waiting then rinsing it again after a specified time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s only complaint was the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product but you have to follow directions or your hair will look greasy.. I know because I had to learn hahah... I love this product my hair loves this product..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy could cause hair loss. Chaz dean was sued by hundreds of women for this.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Hair saver!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. Makes her hair look really good. She tries A LOT of different expensive brands, but says this is by far, her favorite. It&#x27;s expensive, but it gets me lucky, so I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try this product for a longtime and now I wish I w have bought a smaller amount. Day one the product does offer benefits, but I found that it is not lastilast fresh smelling after the first day.</li>
    <li> Not so good  would not purchase again smells like it&#x27;s old like hamster cage spent 100.oo $ my friend ordered from wen infomercial and smelled good and worked nicely but I ordered from amazon and seems like it&#x27;s an old product I wish I can send back and get my money back I love everything I have ever gotten from amazon except this stuff</li>
    <li> My hair felt thinner (lots of hair left in the drain after the shower) then I did my research. I recommend you do the same who&#x27;s hi had saved my money!</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my daughter and one item arrived broken.</li>
    <li> I have really thick and wavy coarse hair.  The first time I used the Wen products, my scalp felt nouished and my hair was actually soft.  I am so happy and getting lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair and thought this would be perfect to smooth the flyaways. BUt after about a week i noticed a build up and i found out that they actually use a wax in this... which is what the build up is... I think it might be useful as a conditioner but for my hair type it doesnt work. made my hair look dirty by the end of the day... so i just use it on  my ends now right at the end of the shower...</li>
    <li> I received Wens as a gift. Not much is needed to make my hair softer and fuller. I&#x27;ve been converted to a &amp;#34;Wen Girl&amp;#34;. Love the product.</li>
    <li> Felt like I had helmet head. A lot of buildup.</li>
    <li> Wen is this product going to work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking to buy this for years.  I have thick wavy hair and this product should be perfect for my hair type.  Well I have tried it for over a week and have seen no change in my hair whatsoever.  It is expensive and they require you to use (OVER use) too much product in each application. What a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it should be called Why.  Why did I buy it?</li>
    <li> Did not have great results with this product, did not live up to expectations, next going to try &#x27;Just Natural&#x27; hair care.</li>
    <li> I have read numerous not so flattering reviews about Wen products from other websites but take it from someone who has very thick naturally curly hair, this stuff is AWESOME! When I was using shampoo (even with heavy conditioner) my hair would be tangled and feel very course, however from the first time I tried Wen (years ago) my hair felt silky smooth with no tangles or frizz and it smells terrific. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> So far I love my WEN!  I have found that you must definitely use cool water on your hair, otherwise it does leave your hair feeling greasy.  This is hard for a person who loves hot showers.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo/conditioner and the mist. I&#x27;m not too fond of the rest.</li>
    <li> Dried out my ultra-fine curly hair. Not for me at all.</li>
    <li> did not work any better than anything off the shelf, not worth the money</li>
    <li> I have watched the Wen commercials for years, wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to try it.  I have very curly, coarse Caucasian hair and have never not had tangles in it wet or dry.  Not only are the tangles gone - but from the first &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; my hair has felt like silk and calmed down 1000%!!</li>
    <li> Great price for a really good product.</li>
    <li> ...&amp;#34;Awesome Product&amp;#34;...&amp;#34;Awesome Seller&amp;#34;...&amp;#34;Awesome Service&amp;#34;!!!! Needed this item as a well-deserved Christmas Gift for a relative! The seller miraculously delivered by December 22, 2014, and my relative was &amp;#34;overjoyed&amp;#34; with their gift...&amp;#34;A JOB WELL DONE&amp;#34;...&amp;#34;THANKS-A-MILLION&amp;#34;!!!</li>
    <li> I  am  over  50 years young  and living in  the  sunshine  state..&lt;br /&gt;This  product  is  excellent  for  dry  hair..Love  it....</li>
    <li> Great product but the pump doesn&#x27;t work and I can&#x27;t figure out how to just get a new pump....I&#x27;m about ready to just return it all.</li>
    <li> Go out and buy a conditioner off the shelf… Save your money this is junk!  Over rated And overpriced. This guys laughing all the way to the bank!</li>
    <li> Totally not worth the money.  I&#x27;ll stick with my Pureology, thank you.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait the three weeks it suggests before writing a review. I have to say, I love this stuff! My hair has never been more manageable than it is with after cleansing with it. It took awhile to get use to it not foaming up but now that I have, I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back. I don&#x27;t think this is for everyone though, I used it on my daughter who has a different hair type than me (very fine hair) and it made her hair greasy looking.  I love all the additional products it comes with, especially the Re-moist cleanser, my hair is amazingly soft and shiny after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I think I would have a really hard time going back after using this, cost or not. I do wish the scent was a little stronger, it smells strong in the bottle but the smell doesn&#x27;t really last on your hair after being washed out.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell.  I know this product is very good, and I know that it works.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo it dosen&#x27;t weight my hair down. My hair feels really nice and soft to touch.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t ever tried Wen Products; you are missing out.</li>
    <li> Wen is difficult to wrap your head around....pun intended....&lt;br /&gt;Not having bubbles I&#x27;d so foreign to hair washing!!!, but IT WORKS</li>
    <li> Good quality but too small amount for the money you pay.</li>
    <li> I love the Wen products and I&#x27;m sure I will never go back to regular type shampoo. My hair has looked so much healthier with the Wen products. They are really worth the money,.</li>
    <li> This is terrible it made my hair so dry that it was breaking off, which I then had to go get it cut and start fresh so I did have straw as hair :( I def would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever! I have fine, curly hair that is layered a little below the shoulders. Other products make it overly weighed down or dry and frizzy. But Wen smells wonderful and gives you immediate shine and bounce. My hair has less breakage and feels like silk. My curls are bouncy and shiny. My hair is color treated and this helps the color stay longer.</li>
    <li> I give this no stars and its a lie this product doesn&#x27;t work it made my hair look greasy and flat.I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for anyone.</li>
    <li> Wow my daughter has hair that tends toward oily and looses lots of hair. She talked me into buying her this and what a difference! Her hair is softer, has more shine with the first use and she isn&#x27;t loosing wads of hair. It is rather costly but hard to argue with her results. I have dry curly hair and have been happy with Deva brand for years. I have to say I tried this and noticed my hair was much softer, again with the first use. Our hair just looks and feels healthier even though our hair types are very different.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the way it makes my hair feel. There is lots of body to my hair as well as lots of moisture. I didn&#x27;t think it would work because I have a dred hair style, but I was wrong. It works well!</li>
    <li> Horrible product.... It makes your hair extremely greasy and flat.  Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
    <li> Love it.  No hair loss complaints and no auto renew.  I normally have to wash my hair every day, but when has allowed me to change to every other day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product but it says it&#x27;s a 6 piece set and it&#x27;s clearly 4 pieces. I got what is shown but am curious what these supposed other 2 pieces are</li>
    <li> Wow... I&#x27;m on a military budget. My hair sucks but I guess I need to continue living this way.</li>
    <li> Not totally convinced this will be my product forever.  Has made my dyed gray hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Wife has always liked Wen products and this is no different.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think twice. Buy it. It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
