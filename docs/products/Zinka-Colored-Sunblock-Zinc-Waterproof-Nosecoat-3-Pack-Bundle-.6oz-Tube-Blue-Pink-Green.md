      <li>The kids love the colors.</li>

      <li>But lets it disapear too easily.</li>
      <li>For the cool colors it&#x27;s fine but apply a better block beneath this, it just doesn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
      <li>The Zinka works fine.  </li>
      <li>It is a pleasant smell, but you should know in case you are sensitive to added fragrance.</li>
      <li>Colored Zinka makes for great pictures and memories at all your different vacations.  </li>
      <li>but I am happy with the overall results.</li>
      <li>This provides a great physical barrier without the need of a hat</li>
      <li>Cute colors - would have liked even more color options in the multi-packs, and these were smaller than I&#x27;d anticipated</li>
      <li>Overall, I like the fact that my kids are using zinc on their faces, so it&#x27;s a win.  </li>

      <li>Even with sprinkler fun!  </li>
      <li>Great colors, but never seems to dry.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>Fun as a throwback novelty, but not sure it is the greatest option for kids.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She loves it too, the colors are cool and funky.</li>
      <li>He loved showing up for camp with various colored stripes and/or patterns</li>
      <li>Product is great for sunscreen but kids hair needs to be pulled back very sticky</li>
      <li>Came quick in mail.</li>
      <li>Stayed on for a long time and did a good job of preventing sunburn.</li>
      <li>Came off kind of easily when kids rubbed face and wet.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product ever since I was a little kid and have always had great success.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with this product.  </li>
      <li>Dont laugh</li>
      <li>Color makes it fun to wear, so my daughter likes putting it on.</li>
      <li>burned the eyes and kids did not like the color as i expected...  however, my friends kids loved it and it was recommended to me which is why i bought it - i will give mine to her</li>
      <li>I thought maybe colored sunblock could be fun - like make</li>
      <li>The colors are always fun to play around with.  </li>
      <li>It washed off right away.</li>
      <li>and then can&#x27;t get it off without a good soapy scrub down.</li>
      <li>Washes off far too easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is fun to apply and the colors are cute enough to make designs with the fingers, plus you don&#x27;t miss a spot as you can see exactly where the sunblock is.</li>
      <li>I have been an avid surfer, snowboarder and all around outdoorsman for decades now.  </li>
      <li>It was exactly what the kids wanted for Junior lifeguards this summer.</li>
      <li>BUT, my kids faces have been saved this year thanks to this stuff!</li>
      <li>so I need something that stands up to being slammed face first through the ocean.</li>
      <li>Zinka makes putting sun screen on kids a little bit more fun for them!</li>
      <li>This stuff is super dope and old school!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The quality of the product is excellent. The size of the tube is small. It was exactly what the kids wanted for Junior lifeguards this summer.</li>
    <li> Bought this to cover scars on my daughters face from stitches.  Two great points:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Because of the color you can see if it wears off and re-apply.  super important on long days in the sun&lt;br /&gt;2.  Color makes it fun to wear, so my daughter likes putting it on.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Wore the pink in Key West.</li>
    <li> I purchased Zinka as an additional layer of sun protection for my 8 year old&#x27;s nose.  He burns easily, and even with sunscreen his nose tends to get more sun that I would like.  Last week he was off to daycamp and I knew that he&#x27;d be out in the sun all day. Could I rely on him to reapply sunscreen (and do it well), not really.  Somehow his nose always comes home burnt, so I purchased Zinka as a fun extra layer of protection.  He loved showing up for camp with various colored stripes and/or patterns (yep, he even added in the pink), and at the end of the week his nose was NOT BURNT!!!  Even with sprinkler fun!  His Zinka was the talk of the camp counselors, envied by campmates and kept his nose pale under its colorful camouflage!     My only mild disappointment, the tubes are pretty darn small... I hadn&#x27;t read the description of tube volume and when they were each the size of an average finger I was surprised... but that said I would definitely buy them again when we need a bit of extra fun protection.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use on vacation for my kids. It washed off right away. We even gave it plenty of time to dry.</li>
    <li> I love these colors of this zinc.  I bought these for my kids as throwback to the 80&#x27;s.  They are very fun and they love to put this on in the Texas heat. Unfortunately, the colors rub off so you are left with a smeared blob of color on the area.  Overall, I like the fact that my kids are using zinc on their faces, so it&#x27;s a win.  I wish the zinc would stay put.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is awesome!  I have been an avid surfer, snowboarder and all around outdoorsman for decades now.  I have used this product ever since I was a little kid and have always had great success.  The colors are always fun to play around with.  Colored Zinka makes for great pictures and memories at all your different vacations.  Sports events (with team colors), Lake trips, surf trips, it&#x27;s endless.  I love the fact that through all these years this company has stayed true to putting out a quality product while other sunscreens seem to have watered theirs down to save money.  I heard that there are some new sunscreen regulations coming out that will have to upgrade the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brands due to the lack of Zinc Oxide in them.  This company is the original Zink Oxide and definitely knows what they are doing.</li>
    <li> Zinka makes putting sun screen on kids a little bit more fun for them! Cute colors - would have liked even more color options in the multi-packs, and these were smaller than I&#x27;d anticipated too - guess I didn&#x27;t realize how small .6oz was, probably should have. But these are about the length of a finger so I&#x27;m hoping they will last the summer. But these sure are hard to find in stores, so thanks Amazon for having them!</li>
    <li> My 3 year old is never happy about applying sunblock on her face. I thought maybe colored sunblock could be fun - like make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fun to apply and the colors are cute enough to make designs with the fingers, plus you don&#x27;t miss a spot as you can see exactly where the sunblock is. But you have to re-apply often- so forget about actually making a design again at the beach or pool. It will just be smeared if you are in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending how many kids you are applying this to it may not last very long. I took a picture of all three tubs in my hand to show how small these are. You have to keep reapplying. I took another picture of the sunblock on my hand and another picture on my hand an hour later. It was mostly faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells a bit like coconut. It is a pleasant smell, but you should know in case you are sensitive to added fragrance. It feels creamy and stays rather creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little frustrating that I cannot find what spf this is. But it does work as a sun blocker :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for this product for months and knew him and I like to find my daughter loves pink.</li>
    <li> Just as expected and shown</li>
    <li> burned the eyes and kids did not like the color as i expected...  however, my friends kids loved it and it was recommended to me which is why i bought it - i will give mine to her</li>
    <li> Great sunblock for nose!</li>
    <li> Marginal and pricey. At just over 1/2 of 1oz for each tube it is very pricey ($5 each). In comparison to other brands that would give you 3oz at a similar price point. It looks like they do have a corner on the market, however. As for protection, not so great. Both of my kids came back from the pool yesterday with red faces after 1.5hrs. This was after I applied generously to their prime facial spots. In comparison we use Neutrogena and we are covered for that amount time+. For the cool colors it&#x27;s fine but apply a better block beneath this, it just doesn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
    <li> We had so much fun with this with the kiddos at the lake!  I only wish they would make it in a stick like an oversized chapstick that my mom used to be able to find when I was little, it made it really easy to apply when it was in stick form.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and my kids love them too. My only complaint is that it comes off too easily. Especially when the kids are I the water.</li>
    <li> very good at blocking sun. sweat proof but they can be worn off by water and wiping, so frequent application is necessary if you are going to get in and out of water</li>
    <li> My kids LOVED it!!  It was the first time we left the waterpark with out burnt noses and faces.  My kids are constantly wiping off the water from their eyes.  We would leave the waterpark with burnt eyes and noses.  The zinka was a great reminder to keep reapplying because I could always tell when the sunblock had been wiped off.</li>
    <li> I love it!  The kids like it until other kids or parents either ask them to wash the paint off there faces before they get in the pool (legit req) or &amp;#34;why is there blue on your face&amp;#34;.  I have noticed that it does seem to stain clothing but I haven&#x27;t tried to use any stain sticks yet.  Just marks on his white rash guard but I really don&#x27;t care if it means them not getting burned at swim camp what ever!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will let you all know that I went to many stores to find it, nope only online these days.  Was so grateful for the quick shipping!!!!!</li>
    <li> I know that the size is advertised when you buy it - but seriously - this is sooo small - you barely have the chance to use it...</li>
    <li> The green isn&#x27;t as covering as the blue and pink, and it does smear a little. BUT, my kids faces have been saved this year thanks to this stuff! We will be lifers!</li>
    <li> Product is great for sunscreen but kids hair needs to be pulled back very sticky</li>
    <li> Great colour and clean application</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm, and although tubes are small, it goes a long way.  The multi colored pack is awesome because you immediately have the ability to make art on faces.  Works just as well as the zinka of the 80&#x27;s....</li>
    <li> Grandkids used it while vacationing at the ocean. Stayed on for a long time and did a good job of preventing sunburn.</li>
    <li> not really thick enough to stay put on your face, smears all over the place.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t bother with trying to get it fixed. Good product, just not the colors I wanted.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, this is the Zink from the olden days with color. Nice THICK coating can stand up to hours in the water. Not like the others that wash off after 30 or so minutes in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 6&#x27;3, 255lb man and I wear my Pink (or whatever color my daughter picks) on my nose with no worries now about getting sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it too, the colors are cool and funky.</li>
    <li> i hadn&#x27;t used this since my mom and dad put it on my nose as i was a kid. I stumbled upon the product in a local Big 5 sporting goods store and have been a loyal fan ever since! whenever i wear it people literally ask me where they can buy it. it protects the freckles on my nose and i always lather up my niece and nephews when we go to the park. love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Got these for my 9 year old fair skin son. We all liked them, they were fun to put on and play with... However, NOT WATERPROOF... boomer :(</li>
    <li> We live in the &amp;#34;Sunshine&amp;#34; state and have used Zinka nose coat for close to 30 years.  It works!!!!! Zinka nose coat is an awesome product!!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing protects like Zink oxide.</li>
    <li> We ordered more after my daughter tried it!  Perfect for HOT summer days on the lake in Idaho!</li>
    <li> good price and i like this product, my daughter is a surf instructor and she recommends it too</li>
    <li> Worked great as a sun block and my daughter loved putting on the &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; before going into the pool.</li>
    <li> It was a great product and made going to the beach super fun!</li>
    <li> it worked great thanks amazon</li>
    <li> The Zinka works fine.  Kinda messy, and pretty expensive, but it works all the same.  The kids love the colors.</li>
    <li> works good, colors are nice. use it for my horses noses. it stays on fairly long and protects well. Only thing the tubes are really small and for the amounts I have to use it is fairly expensive.... wish the tubes were bigger for this price.</li>
    <li> Very small tubes. Great colors, but never seems to dry. I remember having the same problem in the 80s as a kid and ruining some suimsuits. Fun as a throwback novelty, but not sure it is the greatest option for kids.</li>
    <li> Came quick in mail. Sunblock works well.</li>
    <li> Super happy with this product. Kids LOVE it!!!!</li>
    <li> Already knew Zinka was a great product. I got these for my gf who works for a dermatologist and she loves playing with her new sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Tubes are too small for the money</li>
    <li> I remember zinc block from when I was younger and my little one was having some issues with the sunscreen under her eye I thought this was the perfect solution. She loves face paint so I thought she&#x27;d also get behind it but nope-- doesn&#x27;t like it at all. Not sure if it&#x27;s just 4 year old fickleness or if it bothers her under her eyes but we&#x27;ll tuck it away for another time.</li>
    <li> it works.  I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with this product.  And I found that it moisturizes my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product I have been using it since I was a kid. Product came fast.</li>
    <li> Rubs off immediately.  Really thin.  Not sure if Zinka changed their formula but I remember it used to go on thicker and stay on better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is super dope and old school! The reason I got this though is that I have very light complexion and as a lifeguard, my nose would invariably get burned. This provides a great physical barrier without the need of a hat</li>
    <li> I used these fun colors back in the 80&#x27;s. I decided to buy some for my young daughter. It doesn&#x27;t stay on as well as I remember and it spread on unevenly. For the price, I think I will go with another product. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> Does the job but could be thicker. Washes off far too easily. I use it for water sports so I need something that stands up to being slammed face first through the ocean.</li>
    <li> I thought these would be a fun way of getting kids to wear sunscreen, but these are a mess. The beeswax binder is both difficult to get off, yet doesn&#x27;t stay put. Terrible combo. Terrible for kids too, because they get it everywhere and then can&#x27;t get it off without a good soapy scrub down.</li>
    <li> Love it! Had something like this 24 yrs ago still have it! Love to see it in a round container!</li>
    <li> Kids and adults love this stuff. Just like the zinc compacts from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Worked good in summer sun.  Came off kind of easily when kids rubbed face and wet.  But with this product reapplied a few times with sunblock worked well.  We had no intense sunburn.</li>
    <li> color coded was the magic for this.  Taking identical twins out fishing.  Crew needs to be able to tell them apart. Dont laugh</li>
    <li> My daughter (5) actually likes to put this sunscreen on because we can make it like face painting. I wish the bottles were bigger. I will have to order another set before the end of summer. Great Fun for kids.</li>
    <li> This worked really good during our vacation. Last year on the beach the kids got burned really bad on their faces even with all the sunblock I put on then. This year we spent a week on the beach, in the sun, ocean or pool all day and they had no burns at all. I still put the sunblock on and then a thick layer of this on top. The kids like the colors and it stays put for a while. Had to re-apply a few times because it does rubs off if they touch their faces and after hours in the water but I am happy with the overall results. The tubs are a little small, about the size of a travel tube of tooth paste but I was putting this on 4 kids and still have enough.</li>
    <li> Order came as promised date scheduled. Was used for a foru week camp in California Mountains and Beaches. Really kept the sun of the chil&#x27;s skin and kept her from burning. Stays on even when wet. Great to have so many color choices!</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever made. Blocks everything. Use it for boarding, snorkeling, and shmelking. Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> The kids had a great time with the zinc.  However, I did not pay attention to the size of the tubes when ordering.  They were small for the price I thought.</li>
    <li> This smears, it&#x27;s not thick enough and gets messy and gets on all clothes and bathing suits.</li>
    <li> wipes, rubs, sweats off very easilly.  Doesn&#x27;t dry, which is comfortable.  But lets it disapear too easily.</li>
    <li> Great products and super fun for the kids.  I am glad I found them.</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps the kids safe, and they love using it like war paint.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, works as expected.  My son liked the colors!</li>
    <li> Great.  Kinda expensive but I know kids will love it and wont balk at putting sunscreen on.  Wish it came in draw on stick.</li>
    <li> Not for sensitive skin. Tends to sting upon application to face, which is why I purchased it. My kids also indicated burning sensation after product was washed off.</li>
    <li> Bought this thinking oh for fun, a throwback to the late 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s... Sadly they have changed the way they make this.  The old stuff used to stick to you and not be sticky at all - the new stuff stays creamy and never dries, so if you accidently touch your face, it smears and makes a big ole mess.  Complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> These different colors are lots of fun and give you the protection of zinc.  however Blue is the only color that jumps out where as the other two are just there.  Sometimes just odd looking.  Leaves quite a mess on everything that it touches.  Wet suits rash guards and towels alike.  Good side is that you can see exactly where it rubbed off.</li>
    <li> Color does not stay like the old stuff.  Please someone bring it back.</li>
    <li> small amount but excellent blockage</li>
</ol>
