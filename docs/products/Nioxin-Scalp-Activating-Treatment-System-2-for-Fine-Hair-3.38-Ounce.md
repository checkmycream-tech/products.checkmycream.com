      <li>it is like a really mild mouse that lets you style your hair a bit</li>
      <li>Price is right.</li>
      <li>When I first started using Nioxin products I originally used the products for normal hair (System 1)</li>
      <li>is the first time I have tried this product.</li>
      <li>And from what I&#x27;ve read, I&#x27;m not the first person that has had this happen.</li>
      <li>This was the same I was getting for much more at the salon.  </li>
      <li>and then it becomes less effective.</li>
      <li>This system really does work, much to my surprise.  </li>
      <li>It really does make my thinning hair look a lot thicker.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for 6 months and my hair really appears to be thicker.  </li>
      <li>Its not effective on its own and the other products not as effective without it.</li>
      <li>I use the #2 system for thinning hair which makes it possible to clean gently but thoroughly without adding deposits.</li>
      <li>so that is normal, she also said after doing this for 25 years her suggestion would be to buy&lt;br /&gt;a cheaper shampoo and conditioner as there is no proof it does much for regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>However, it does seem to give my fine, thin hair more body.</li>
      <li>The mousse goes a long way as you only need to apply it on the thinning areas making sure you massage it into your scalp</li>
      <li>It sure is messy though.  </li>
      <li>It actually made me loose more hair trying to detangle my hair.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell if it is working.</li>
      <li>To use it properly, you must use it daily and it has too much water in it for our hair type.</li>
      <li>when I started using the Scalp Activating treatment it made my hair feel very stiff like it was full of hairspray.  </li>

    <li> I like the product and it&#x27;s easy to use and it also makes my hair easier to style.  It&#x27;s too early to tell if it is working.</li>
    <li> This was the same I was getting for much more at the salon.  It is a good value and quick shipping</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004T19NZY Nioxin Scalp Activating Treatment System 2 for Fine Hair, 3.4 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have tried this product. It gives body to my very fine hair and protects it against the hot sun and elements.  It only takes a small amount to do the job , using too much makes the hair stiff.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says.  I found it to help my thinning hair appear and feel fuller and yet didn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff.  Price is right.</li>
    <li> This system really does work, much to my surprise.  I have been using it for 6 months and my hair really appears to be thicker.  So happy!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too sure whether I like this product or not.  When I first started using Nioxin products I originally used the products for normal hair (System 1) and I liked them.  Then I realized I was actually supposed to be using the system 2 items for for my hair and when I started using the Scalp Activating treatment it made my hair feel very stiff like it was full of hairspray.  Granted it made my hair feel thicker and possibly look thicker but I do not like the way it feels in my hair.  I don&#x27;t know if this is due to my hair being long (about shoulder length) or not.  Even as I continue to use it, it does not seem to change or get any better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for six months and have hair growth in an area of my scalp that I haven&#x27;t had in +/- 20 years.</li>
    <li> My son uses this, but it seems like it only works for a short amount of time and then it becomes less effective.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product for my husband, and now we both are dedicated users of Nioxin products.  My husbands scalp has never felt or looked better.  Our hair looks fuller and is more manageable.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with my order.  Thank you, and I will be ordering again.  I absolutely love my product.</li>
    <li> I use this product on a daily basis and this is the best price going.</li>
    <li> This product was not for me...it made my hair dry n tangle up. I used the while system fairhfully for 3 months and the was NO GROWTH at all. It actually made me loose more hair trying to detangle my hair. I will not continue to use this line,</li>
    <li> I think its the better of the product on the market, that being said I think there prices show it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin 1 and 2 tend to make my hair dry and my head breakout (yes acne) my Dermatologist said it does open&lt;br /&gt;the follicles on the scalp so that is normal, she also said after doing this for 25 years her suggestion would be to buy&lt;br /&gt;a cheaper shampoo and conditioner as there is no proof it does much for regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;I could use Nioxin once or twice a week as recommended by the person whom cuts our hair, they both suggested&lt;br /&gt;PROGAINE 2-IN-1 its cheaper and does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it yet, I want to use up the money spend on the Nioxin if anything I wont buy it anymore for&lt;br /&gt;the price my hair has \\&quot;slowed\\&quot; on falling after using it a few times a week, but if I can get something for 1/2 the price&lt;br /&gt;its well worth it!</li>
    <li> This product is great, I started using it on my aunt that had been bold to the scalp. After after 3 weeks I could see lilltle hairs breaking threw the scalp so nice to have a product we belive in</li>
    <li> It really does make my thinning hair look a lot thicker.  About the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the residue it leaves but nothing is perfect.</li>
    <li> I guess it works.  It sure is messy though.  It is a Nioxin product, so I trusted it.  Their shampoo is wonderful if you just want very clean hair.</li>
    <li> There are reviews about this not being the original formulation. Ya coulda fooled me! It works—end of story. I use the #2 system for thinning hair which makes it possible to clean gently but thoroughly without adding deposits. It&#x27;s not that it will make my balding pate grow hair again, but I&#x27;m not losing any now, nor am I suffereing from scales, seborrhea, and other ickies. It&#x27;s not cheap but then again, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It really works and I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my hair as it grows back  Leaving hair silky and shiny</li>
    <li> This product arrived leaking in the packaging.  I returned it and am waiting for my refund.  I use the product on a regular bases and have only ordered it one other time from Amazon.  Hopefully this is not a recurring thing.</li>
    <li> seems to work.... definitely has slowed down hair loss</li>
    <li> I had used the System 1 scalp treatment and assumed this was the same type of gel.  It is a foam, which acts like a mousse - in the beginning I was not sure of it, but as long as I understood that I should only use a bit of it, not a lot I was happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin for the past 10-15 years or so, off and on.  I have tried other products periodically but usually come back to Nioxin as my hair thins further with age (75 year old male).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying Sytems 1 and 2, I have come to the conclusion that System 1 Shampoo and Conditioner are excellent as well as System 2 Scalp Therapy Foam Activating Treatment.  I found that the Shampoo and Conditioner for System 2 never worked for me and was a waste of money.  As it is, Nioxin (now owned by Proctor and Gamble), seems to increase the cost every two years and decrease the size.  They seem to be on track but need further research to improve their products.  The packaging of Sytem 2 Shampoo and Conditioner is faulty as sunshine destroys the tube shaped containers and I had several burst because the Salons have them over a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the unreal retail prices, I only buy Nioxin through Amazon and related online companies.  Why pay $40 when you can get the same product for $20.</li>
    <li> it is like a really mild mouse that lets you style your hair a bit (whats left of it anyway). it also adds volume and has spf 15.</li>
    <li> Use this product all the time.  It does give my very fine hair more body.  Wonderful price and fast shipping.  I will most certainly order again from them.</li>
    <li> The package I received had a leaky bottle, leaving the box soaking wet. And from what I&#x27;ve read, I&#x27;m not the first person that has had this happen. It also leaves my hair brittle as if I have hairspray in it, and doesn&#x27;t keep my hair thick at all.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a few  years now. I have very very thin hair in the front of my scalp. This doesn&#x27;t make a lot grow but it helps and there is a little growth with it. I stopped using it for a year and the hair on my scalp got a lot thinner. Went back to using this and it did improve some but not getting any thinner.</li>
    <li> bought for hubby.  he likes my 3 better. may try in summer cause it has the spf for the scalp</li>
    <li> I unfortunately inherited thin hair and a receding hairline from my dad&#x27;s side. Nioxin noticeably thickened my hair after about 2 weeks of use. #2 shampoo followed by#2 conditioner and finally #2 mousse.Its not effective on its own and the other products not as effective without it. Keep in mind everyone&#x27;s different and the benefits stop when you stop using the product. It did promote new hair growth and the conditioner feels amazing. The mousse goes a long way as you only need to apply it on the thinning areas making sure you massage it into your scalp well. This is the only over the counter treatment that has worked for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years now and I honestly have to say I&#x27;ll continue until something else better comes along. Thank you</li>
    <li> I used this product for over three years. I mostly use it for its SPF protection for my scalp. However, it does seem to give my fine, thin hair more body. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love the Nioxin Cleanser and scalp treatment so wanted to try this out too. Need to use it longer.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
    <li> Works good but takes time. Overall, happy with item.</li>
    <li> Works best with a shorter haircut</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not for black girls with natural pressed or relaxed hair.  To use it properly, you must use it daily and it has too much water in it for our hair type. So, it can only be used when you wash your hair</li>
