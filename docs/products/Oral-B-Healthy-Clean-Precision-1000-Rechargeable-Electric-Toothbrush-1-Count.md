### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am very happy with this electric toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>One of the reviews below is by a hygienist, and is an excellent review.</li>
      <li>It is a great value.</li>
      <li>customer service was great - I missed the return window by one day, and because the item was defective they allowed me to return it for a 100% refund.</li>
      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>This is an exceptional way for toot cleaning.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>well - it doesn&#x27;t have the added frills of the more pricey toothbrushes, but is every bit effective.</li>
      <li>Great toothbrush, light and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Great toothbrush for a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is even better.</li>
      <li>I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many, many years.  </li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>I take mine in the shower, OK TMI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been satisfied.</li>
      <li>If I had to go replace my own brush today, I would buy a Healthy Clean.</li>
      <li>I use the Oral B Triumph myself, because I received it as a free promotional item while still a dental hygiene student, but my daughter uses the Healthy Clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, easy to use and as said, avoid teeth problems.</li>
      <li>The brush has a warning light indicating when the battery needs to be recharged.</li>
      <li>My first one that I bought probably four years ago still works fine.</li>
      <li>It has a lot more power than my older one.</li>
      <li>Overall a good buy, kind of need to charge regularly.</li>
      <li>I was concerned about getting new one since I liked the one I had so much.</li>
      <li>The brush is just right for me.</li>
      <li>Also, let&#x27;s face it, the Healthy Clean can be had in hot pink.</li>
      <li>Personally I love the 30 second reminder.</li>
      <li>This was a better price than some of the others that were similar.</li>
      <li>Sure, it does not bluetooth connect to your smartphone, have an LCD display, or multiple brushing modes, but the fact of the matter is that most people will only ever turn their brush off and on.</li>
      <li>Small brush provides easy control and many angles.</li>
      <li>Just returned from a 4 week trip in Europe, used this every day, and it is just as strong now as when I left.</li>
      <li>at the end of 3 days I really feel it&#x27;s ready for a charge.</li>
      <li>Eventually the battery wears out and I need to replace the whole kit.  </li>
      <li>Overall a very functional, price worthy electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>When one of my toothbrushes died after a long life, due to battery exhaustion, I bout the Healthy Clean Precision 1000.</li>
      <li>research shows the rotation-oscillation motion of the Oral B line to be superior (if only slightly) for plaque removal compared to Sonicare (which is ALSO a great option, don&#x27;t get me wrong). 2)</li>
      <li>I have many gold caps to brush &amp;  the round brush head cleans very well.</li>
      <li>Recommend this seller highly</li>
      <li>I recommend the Healthy Clean over other Oral B models for a few reasons.</li>
      <li>I find my teeth are MUCH cleaner with this brush, and you will find your self brushing longer then by using a simple brush.</li>
      <li>Small head that is easy to get around your back teeth.</li>
      <li>I had an old ORAL toothbrush for years and it finally started to die.</li>
      <li>It was a step up from the one I replaced, but not as fancy as the Professional Care model I have at my second home.</li>
      <li>Not nearly as good as my original Braun which lasted ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> The base is a cheap piece of plastic and I will not risk ordering this brand again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This eliminates the need to keep the charger plugged in and save at least a little electricity.</li>
<li> I have now owned two different Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes with the same charging base.</li>
<li> To follow along, I also have the Triumph, this one is less expensive and handle is sleeker.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
<li> The charger base doesn&#x27;t take up mush space on the counter.</li>

    <li> I am very happy with this electric toothbrush.  I have had it for about 3 weeks now.  The charge lasts for over a week and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many, many years.  Eventually the battery wears out and I need to replace the whole kit.  Just purchased this one, so I can&#x27;t say how long it will last.  My experience is the more expensive the brush, the longer lasting the battery.</li>
    <li> I had an old ORAL toothbrush for years and it finally started to die. I was concerned about getting new one since I liked the one I had so much. This toothbrush is even better.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional way for toot cleaning. It&#x27;s comfortable, easy to use and as said, avoid teeth problems. Don&#x27;t think twice.</li>
    <li> The brush is just right for me. I have many gold caps to brush &amp;  the round brush head cleans very well.</li>
    <li> It works. Works well, except I do see a drop in power after 3 days with only 6 to 8 uses.  So I believe I remember at 10 day use, but I have never let it go that long. at the end of 3 days I really feel it&#x27;s ready for a charge.</li>
    <li> One of the reviews below is by a hygienist, and is an excellent review. To follow along, I also have the Triumph, this one is less expensive and handle is sleeker. I have braces, and the orthodontist said you should never brush back and forth, as it damages the gums, especially with the fact you are wedging the brush between the gum and the braces. With the Oral B spin brushes, this problem goes away, as the brush spins. I find my teeth are MUCH cleaner with this brush, and you will find your self brushing longer then by using a simple brush. I take mine in the shower, OK TMI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
    <li> I have used the oral Bs for years. It seems to be getting harder to find the simple ones. I found this and it is just what I am used to. Love it. Small head that is easy to get around your back teeth.</li>
    <li> I have now owned two different Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes with the same charging base. The first one stopped charging after about 6 months, and this one, which I only ordered because it was Black Friday and the price was 29.99 (and I thought a higher quality version from Oral-B would have a better charging base), burned out after less than 3 months. I keep the charger away from all water sources and thoroughly dry the toothbrush handle before putting it back on the charger. The base is a cheap piece of plastic and I will not risk ordering this brand again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon customer service was great - I missed the return window by one day, and because the item was defective they allowed me to return it for a 100% refund. I don&#x27;t know what toothbrush I&#x27;ll try next, but I will order it from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B for years.  This electric toothbrush does the job well - it doesn&#x27;t have the added frills of the more pricey toothbrushes, but is every bit effective.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, light and easy to use.  Recommend this seller highly</li>
    <li> Overall a good buy, kind of need to charge regularly.</li>
    <li> Two people use this toothbrush and it stays charged for over a week.</li>
    <li> I recommend the Healthy Clean over other Oral B models for a few reasons. 1) research shows the rotation-oscillation motion of the Oral B line to be superior (if only slightly) for plaque removal compared to Sonicare (which is ALSO a great option, don&#x27;t get me wrong). 2) It is a great value. Sure, it does not bluetooth connect to your smartphone, have an LCD display, or multiple brushing modes, but the fact of the matter is that most people will only ever turn their brush off and on. I use the Oral B Triumph myself, because I received it as a free promotional item while still a dental hygiene student, but my daughter uses the Healthy Clean. I used it once by accident and found the battery power to be the same as the Triumph&#x27;s, but with a lighter handle design. Also, let&#x27;s face it, the Healthy Clean can be had in hot pink. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush. If I had to go replace my own brush today, I would buy a Healthy Clean.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as my original Braun which lasted ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one speed, and it stalls, sigh......</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral B electric toothbrush. My first one that I bought probably four years ago still works fine. I have to travel so I just keep one in my travel bag. My only complaint with the new brush is that the power button is too flush to the handle and is hard to feel to press and turn the brush off without looking at the handle.....while the used toothpaste spins off all over the bathroom. Just have to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. The charger base doesn&#x27;t take up mush space on the counter. It has a lot more power than my older one. This was a better price than some of the others that were similar.</li>
    <li> Just returned from a 4 week trip in Europe, used this every day, and it is just as strong now as when I left. great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun dental products for years. I&#x27;ve always been satisfied. When one of my toothbrushes died after a long life, due to battery exhaustion, I bout the Healthy Clean Precision 1000. It was a step up from the one I replaced, but not as fancy as the Professional Care model I have at my second home. I am completely satisfied. I like the built in timer which helps control the time spent brushing each quadrant. The brush has a warning light indicating when the battery needs to be recharged. This eliminates the need to keep the charger plugged in and save at least a little electricity. Great toothbrush for a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. No fancy settings but practical. Personally I love the 30 second reminder. Small brush provides easy control and many angles. You can find inexpensive compatible replace brush head is a plus. Overall a very functional, price worthy electric toothbrush.</li>
