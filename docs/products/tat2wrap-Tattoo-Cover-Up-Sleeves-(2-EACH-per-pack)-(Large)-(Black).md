      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>Great fit for what I was looking for</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;not to warm</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product that meets all of my needs while looking fashionable.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item for my Grand daughters that need to hide tats at work and they like them</li>
      <li>And to top it all off my arms</li>
      <li>I think I will get more.    </li>
      <li>Now with the sleeves I&#x27;m nice and cool.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re so comfortable to wear all day at work.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re light weight and cover up everything.</li>
      <li>I liked the fabric very breathable.</li>
      <li>I would be hot and sweaty wearing the jacket over my scrub top.</li>
      <li>I wear them frequently, size is right, cool looking, and the price is right!  </li>
      <li>Very very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>but the large was the biggest and fit my lower arm but doesnt fit my upper part of my arm at all</li>
      <li>but again with the nylon style I got too hot.</li>
      <li>I tried some different type sleeves most of which were nylon</li>
      <li>Unraveled with the first use.</li>
      <li>Service was fast and I am very pleased because quality and price is half what I paid before.    </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I really recommend these for people with tattoos.</li>
      <li>I bought these for my wife and she is very satisfield with these.</li>
      <li>These sleeves are cotton and breath so much better and keep me much cooler than the previous sleeves.</li>
      <li>I worked an 8 hour shift wearing this and in this time the top part was way too tight</li>
      <li>I followed the chart that was provided but the product was wayy too tight for the person i bought it for, but we couldn&#x27;t return it because i was confident that it would be a good fit, it was very disappointing.</li>
      <li>They might be great for cold areas, I live in fla</li>
      <li>The material is cheap and very small for a large.</li>
      <li>The sleeve fits well  and is comfortable but the ends are already starting to break apart after only a few washes.</li>
      <li>I wore long sleeve shirts for a long time but it was way too hot for me.</li>

    <li> Hubby is very pleased with his purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife and she is very satisfield with these. I woul definitely recommend for anyone looking to cover up there tattoos.</li>
    <li> I love my tattoo sleeves! They&#x27;re so comfortable to wear all day at work. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product that meets all of my needs while looking fashionable. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love these sleeves!  I wear them frequently, size is right, cool looking, and the price is right!  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> The material is cheap and very small for a large.</li>
    <li> I liked the fabric very breathable. I worked an 8 hour shift wearing this and in this time the top part was way too tight it actually bruised my arm. And to top it all off my arms were covered in a rash. Allergic to something they made or washed it with. Wish I could send back.</li>
    <li> Very very fast shipping. Works great!</li>
    <li> The measurements were not correct. I followed the chart that was provided but the product was wayy too tight for the person i bought it for, but we couldn&#x27;t return it because i was confident that it would be a good fit, it was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I am sleeved on both arms and these cover up my tattoos. They&#x27;re light weight and cover up everything. I really recommend these for people with tattoos.</li>
    <li> I used to have to wear a scrub jacket to cover my arms. Never again!  These sleeves are the best. I would be hot and sweaty wearing the jacket over my scrub top. Now with the sleeves I&#x27;m nice and cool.</li>
    <li> Great fit for what I was looking for but I gave this item 4stars because the material was extremely to thick. They might be great for cold areas, I live in fla so go figure.</li>
    <li> Very warm... But did what it was suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Love them! Fit great, feel great, look great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my Grand daughters that need to hide tats at work and they like them&lt;br /&gt;not to warm</li>
    <li> It does it job but. Unraveled with the first use. I thought it was a cooling sleeve. But it is heave sock like material</li>
    <li> I just got mine in the mail. Service was fast and I am very pleased because quality and price is half what I paid before.    I got three different colors, but there are ten to choose from.  I think I will get more.    [...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a X-Ray Tech and the hospital I work at does not allow Tattoos to be displayed. I wore long sleeve shirts for a long time but it was way too hot for me. I tried some different type sleeves most of which were nylon but again with the nylon style I got too hot. These sleeves are cotton and breath so much better and keep me much cooler than the previous sleeves. Another big plus is the variety of colors to match any scrubs I might wear.</li>
    <li> The sleeve fits well  and is comfortable but the ends are already starting to break apart after only a few washes.</li>
    <li> I like the idea but the large was the biggest and fit my lower arm but doesnt fit my upper part of my arm at all wish they had the next size up</li>
