<li> You cannot go wrong with Mrs. Meyers products.</li>
<li> We had a very cold winter</li>
<li> Horrible fragrance on the lavender, does not even come close to a lavender scent in any way shape or form.</li>

    <li> Hand soap, dish soap or spray cleaners, if you have to clean making it pleasant instead of stinky or overpowering is great.  And they WORK. Better than the stuff that makes you run gasping from your task. I sent some to my mother and daughter. And I hate cleaning, now, not so much.</li>
    <li> These smell amazing.  And they go a long way too!</li>
    <li> Both smell great. Received within timeframe</li>
    <li> Horrible fragrance on the lavender, does not even come close to a lavender scent in any way shape or form. It smells like rotting vegetation. The Lemon Verbena smells a little like what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like. I&#x27;ve enjoyed other Meyers products for years this is the first time I bought the hand soap and am very very disappointed with the watery non-lathering &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; and the fragrance, will never buy again. I wonder if this is a fake product, and not Meyers at all.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  Bought the candle, cleaning products and love them all!</li>
    <li> Great quality and price! Lavender one is especially heavenly.</li>
    <li> The soap arrived yesterday and when I removed it from the box one of the containers is leaking soap. I have no one to contact to send me a new one. The other is fine .</li>
    <li> I think the scent is pretty bad. Otherwise, OK.  I&#x27;m buying something else next time.</li>
    <li> Nice product, leaves behind a clean scent.</li>
    <li> I love Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s soaps and cleansers. They get the job done, smell nice, and are never harsh or drying.

    <li> Two of my favorite scents! I love this soap! Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This soap smells amazing, and the scent lasts a long time after use, without being overly strong or at all perfumey. Highest marks.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It has a gel consistency.  I thought it could double as dish soap, but the scent sticks to the dishes.  Great to have it on my hands, though.</li>
    <li> Discovered this at a bed-n-breakfast, and was hooked!  Smells divine, esp. the lavender, and cleans great.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! I love the smell of both. I&#x27;ll be ordering more Mrs. Meyers products in the future.  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> A favorite family hand soap for the bathroom...clean fragrances and easy on the hands.  Very pleased to see Meyers on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I think they kinda smell funny.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, but lacking on the substance.  I feel like i need more to get clean.  Other liquid soaps work better in my opinion, Bath and Body Works and they have great fragrances as well</li>

    <li> I love the scents of these perfumes . Good quality</li>
    <li> Great smell, gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for about a month and I really love it.  We had a very cold winter and I was searching for a soap that would help my hands to heal.  The olive oil and aloe very seem to have really worked.  My hands are much better.  I like the fresh lemon scent and I am getting ready to order the large, more economical refill size.  We plan to use this soap in the kitchen and bathrooms from now on.</li>
    <li> I like this hand soap because of the smell. Hopefully its not a small company thats about about to or is being taken over by a corporation that will destroy the integrity of the products.</li>
    <li> The scent isn&#x27;t obnoxious, the bottle is refillable AND recyclable, and it gets hands clean without making a mess. Better price here than local stores, unfortunately. Hoping to add it to my Subscribe &amp; Save items!</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like Mrs. Meyers scents. They seem sharp to me. cleans fine though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mrs. Meyers products for a couple years now since switching to a more natural lifestyle and I absolutely LOVE the hand soap especially.  My hands are always left feeling clean and moisturized and smelling AMAZING.</li>
    <li> Consistantly superior</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Wonderful smell, but not overly fragrant.</li>
