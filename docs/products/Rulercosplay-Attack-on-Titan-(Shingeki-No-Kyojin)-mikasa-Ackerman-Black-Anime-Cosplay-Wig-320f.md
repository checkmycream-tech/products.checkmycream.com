      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good Mikasa Ackerman wig, then look no further.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really nice quality, super soft.</li>
      <li>That my friends, is insanely quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Came very fast though, which IS a plus!</li>
      <li>I ordered it exactly one week ago!</li>
      <li>Totally worth it.</li>
      <li>The texture is nice and it would work very well if you were actually cosplaying Mikasa.</li>
      <li>It came in super fast</li>
      <li>This wig is amazing and it came faster than expected.</li>
      <li>This wig took me forever to put on first of all.</li>
      <li>However now, everything is sorted and it&#x27;s such a lovely wig.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not an avid wig buyer</li>
      <li>It comes mostly styled all I had to do was trim the bangs a bit since they&#x27;re pretty long.</li>
      <li>If you have a large head or a lot of hair, I would not recommend this.</li>
      <li>The wig was of very high quality.</li>
      <li>Haha.</li>
      <li>I would really recommend this</li>
      <li>T was very frizzy and knotted therefore, I had to comb and style the wig</li>
      <li>When it arrived, however, it was much shorter than I anticipated.</li>
      <li>It feels like my real hair</li>
      <li>and I just need to give it proper care, but it really doesn&#x27;t seem like full pieces should be falling out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft, and pretty.</li>
      <li>For the price, this is definitely a decent wig.</li>
      <li>, I highly recommend you guys to buy it if you want to cosplay as Mikasa...</li>
      <li>It could be a bit tight for some but does fit my head very well!</li>
      <li>It felt extremely soft, almost like real hair.</li>
      <li>Normally I&#x27;d be scared to order something</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal in all wigs</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s softer than my own hair and amazingly thick.</li>
      <li>and I live in Virginia.</li>
      <li>It was soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle!</li>
      <li>If I could give this seller more stars I would, this is my third wig from them and all of their wigs are less than 20 with quality beyond belief.</li>
      <li>I was a little suspicious on why it was so cheap but</li>
      <li>I went to a convention as young Mikasa and the wig looked</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t corporate because it&#x27;s just straight cut bangs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s straightenable and feels so soft.</li>
      <li>It arrived several weeks early, the wig is soft and almost feels and looks like real hair.  </li>
      <li>I originally ordered this wig for a Shay Cormac cosplay, assuming from the picture that it was shoulder-length, and therefore long enough for me to style back into a ponytail.</li>
      <li>A quick little trim</li>
      <li>And there&#x27;s barely any fall out!</li>
      <li>Then, it barely comes to my chin.</li>
      <li>The fibers are soft, and there&#x27;s a small skin top about an inch and a half in diameter.</li>
      <li>(It curves inward from the tips) and I cut the little hair mikasa has in the center of her face to fit my face shape.</li>

<li> The wig-head used in the picture makes the wig look at least 3-4 inches longer; in reality, it ended up coming down to about my chin, and the hair in the back was too short to pull up into anything at all.</li>
<li> It is a little long, too...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered this wig and the harness on October 11 hoping i would get it by Halloween. But sadly that didn&#x27;t happen. It was shipped on October 12 and i just got the wig today, November 7 after school,almost a month later. I read the reviews like a Bible and some people said the wig was too long but my wig was as short as Mikasa&#x27;s hair. Im really happy that i have it now. It feels like my real hair and i didn&#x27;t want to take it off. I would really recommend this</li>
    <li> Beautiful quality. It&#x27;s softer than my own hair and amazingly thick. I didn&#x27;t even have to style it, except maybe a bit of gel to hold the center bang bit. If I could give this seller more stars I would, this is my third wig from them and all of their wigs are less than 20 with quality beyond belief. Buy from these guys. They&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> Accurate to picture, very soft and really good quality for the price. It gave me about a month&#x27;s window for it to arrive, and it showed up much before then, so shipping was great.</li>
    <li> This wig is really awesome. It came in super fast but I must admit, when I first got it, it came in pretty bad conditions. T was very frizzy and knotted therefore, I had to comb and style the wig everytime I put it on. However now, everything is sorted and it&#x27;s such a lovely wig. It fits the description of Mikasa. It&#x27;s soft, and pretty. If you are Cosplaying Mikasa, I recommend getting this.</li>
    <li> Seriously amazing. Ive never loved a wig so much</li>
    <li> The wig is incredibly soft, shiny and perfect for cosplaying Mikasa. Its a good price too for people who don&#x27;t want to spend $30+ on a wig. The bangs were a bit long though so i had to trim them.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is definitely a decent wig. But beware: You are getting what you pay for. This isn&#x27;t going to be like an Arda wig or an EpicCosplay wig - it&#x27;s only just a step above Party City wigs. The fibers are soft, and there&#x27;s a small skin top about an inch and a half in diameter. If you have a large head or a lot of hair, I would not recommend this. The inner mesh isn&#x27;t very stretchy, so it may end up being too small for you. On that note, the inside of the wig IS mesh rather than other wigs that only have the mesh on the upper portion of the wig and wefts sewn along stretchy bands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not looking for a fancy wig and just need something simple, this&#x27;ll work for you. Also the length is a little shorter than the stock photo.</li>
    <li> Holy cow. This wig is awesome, it&#x27;s super soft, feels super real and silky. Easy to brush through, no tangles!! It even came with a wig cap (which is good because I always lose mine) 10/10 would buy again</li>
    <li> This wig took me forever to put on first of all. Then, it barely comes to my chin. There are hardly any bangs and the little swishy bang part in the front doesn&#x27;t corporate because it&#x27;s just straight cut bangs. I will never buy this again and won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This wig was perfect! It comes unstyled though so you have to trim the bangs and fix it up a bit to get it looking great, but i strongly recommend buying this wig. It hardy sheds at all which i love!</li>
    <li> Really liked the wig! Good quality and perfectly fitted for my head and with my thick hair under two wigs caps it was no problem! So excited to cosplay as Mikasa!</li>
    <li> The wig is wonderful quality especially for the price. It has a nice smooth texture and is rich in color. It could be a bit tight for some but does fit my head very well!</li>
    <li> The wig arrived way ahead of time, and it&#x27;s amazing quality. Very thick and well made. Normally I&#x27;d be scared to order something this cheap, but it&#x27;s honestly a steal. The wig&#x27;s amazing and holds up really well. Totally worth it. c:</li>
    <li> I was a little suspicious on why it was so cheap but its great! It arrived several weeks early, the wig is soft and almost feels and looks like real hair.  I love it, I highly recommend you guys to buy it if you want to cosplay as Mikasa...it even is adjustable to head size and comes with a hair net.</li>
    <li> I got this wig for a Midnight Ahri cosplay and it is waaaaaaaaaay too short. Hardly fit my head. Waste of money and I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to an anime convention in 11 days and this wig came in today! I ordered it exactly one week ago! This product comes from China and I live in Virginia. That my friends, is insanely quick shipping. The wig is gorgeous and matches my eyelashes and eyebrows perfectly. I am so excited! The bangs are a bit too long but I can fix that. Great wig, would buy from this company again.Cadet Ackerman out.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this wig from how cheap it was but I&#x27;ve gone through Rulercosplay before so I bought it and wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It comes mostly styled all I had to do was trim the bangs a bit since they&#x27;re pretty long.</li>
    <li> This wig was truly amazing! It felt extremely soft, almost like real hair. The bangs were slightly long, but that isn&#x27;t hard to fix. A quick little trim and it&#x27;s prefect. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this wig for a Shay Cormac cosplay, assuming from the picture that it was shoulder-length, and therefore long enough for me to style back into a ponytail. When it arrived, however, it was much shorter than I anticipated. The wig-head used in the picture makes the wig look at least 3-4 inches longer; in reality, it ended up coming down to about my chin, and the hair in the back was too short to pull up into anything at all. It&#x27;s basically a bob, so if that&#x27;s not what you want, don&#x27;t buy this.&lt;br /&gt;Past my personal disappointment in the length, though, it&#x27;s actually a decent wig, for the price I got it for. The texture is nice and it would work very well if you were actually cosplaying Mikasa. Small pieces of hair fall out of it occasionally, though, which concerns me. I have bits of black hair all over my bathroom. I&#x27;m not an avid wig buyer so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal in all wigs and I just need to give it proper care, but it really doesn&#x27;t seem like full pieces should be falling out.</li>
    <li> It is definitely what you pay for. The bangs are not styled as they are in the picture, in fact, they aren&#x27;t at all. It is a little long, too... But it fits okay and seems to be an okay quality for what I paid. Came very fast though, which IS a plus!</li>
    <li> I was really surprise to get such a beautiful wig for the price I paid. I am really happy with it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing and it came faster than expected. It is the perfect cut, length, and color for my daughter to wear for her Mikasa cosplay. I would indeed recommend this wig.</li>
    <li> Its great and all; it looks real. But im having trouble keeping the style of Mikasa.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, the hair is soft and looks great, I&#x27;d recommend this one to anyone looking for a nice mikasa wig&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to show it off in octoger! Thank you</li>
    <li> Holy crap this is the best wig I&#x27;ve ever had on my head! Haha. It&#x27;s really nice quality, super soft. And there&#x27;s barely any fall out! If you&#x27;re looking for a good Mikasa Ackerman wig, then look no further. This one is fabulous. I bought a different Mikasa wig from this site, but this is the only one that had proven to achieve greatness. Super easy to style too!</li>
    <li> This wig was shorter than expected and the bangs do not look anything like the picture.</li>
    <li> Great wig for my Mikasa cosplay(:</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s straightenable and feels so soft. Love it!</li>
    <li> This wig was absolutely perfect! The wig was of very high quality. It was soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle! The wig is heat resistant so I straightened it when I Cosplayed Mikasa. (It curves inward from the tips) and I cut the little hair mikasa has in the center of her face to fit my face shape. I went to a convention as young Mikasa and the wig looked so good people asked me if it was my real hair! 10/10 would recommend!</li>
