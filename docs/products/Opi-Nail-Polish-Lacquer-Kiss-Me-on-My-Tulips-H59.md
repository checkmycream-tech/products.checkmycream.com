      <li>It is just the perfect medium pink.  </li>
      <li>My nieces borrowed mine this summer and loved it so much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to order also a fast dryer lacquer.</li>
      <li>Although, as stated before, my grown daughter has convinced me to jump into wild and wonderful new colors, THIS ONE is the one I use the most, when I use color.  </li>
      <li>and it glides on easily but doesn&#x27;t run.  </li>
      <li>My pedicurist said it was a HUGE seller this summer.</li>

      <li>This is the best Opi pink, but the formula leaves much to be desired.</li>

      <li>Very pretty on toes</li>
      <li>It is bright pink and the color is true to the picture.</li>

      <li>Nail polish is very hard to pick out from a picture; however, I can&#x27;t believe how the picture of this polish is a perfect match to how it looks on your nails.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very pretty bright pink nail polish.</li>
      <li>Once again, I state that OPI is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>It is definitely worth the money in my opinion.</li>
      <li>The others are fun, but this one seems to me to be a color that a lady would wear all the time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the right consistency</li>
      <li>If I am going to spend time painting my nails it had better last.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Although, as stated before, my grown daughter has convinced me to jump into wild and wonderful new colors, THIS ONE is the one I use the most, when I use color.  The others are fun, but this one seems to me to be a color that a lady would wear all the time. Once again, I state that OPI is worth the money.  It doesn&#x27;t chip.  It does strengthen the nails when it is a lacquer and not frosted.  When I want to use a frosted OPI color, I put a coat of a lacquer underneath.  No nail polish, in my opinion, can compete with OPI.  And of course, then there are the funny names to each color, which always bring a chuckle. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This is a great color for summer. I love it and I am very happy with this purchase. It is exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> This color is very flattering on all skin types.  It is just the perfect medium pink.  It makes you feel as if you have just entered a tulip patch.  I love this color!</li>
    <li> This is the best Opi pink, but the formula leaves much to be desired. It&#x27;s goopy, gloppy and very uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is great, but it is very high maintence. It requires many coats(more than 4) and it loses freshness and sparkle very fast.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty shade of pink and it has shimmers and sheers in it. A great quality nail polish with an awesome color! I got super lucky! And I love it!!! I use this color all the time and it is perfect for summer and spring!</li>
    <li> OPI never disappoints they always have a great selection of colors to choose from and the names are hilarious they make me laugh so creative.</li>
    <li> Love the color!  My toes stayed polished for a solid 2 weeks when using 2 coats of the OPI and 1 top coat of clear.</li>
    <li> Very nice color!  Hot pink. Love it! Perfect of the summer and just what i was looking for.  Opi always has a good seletion of colors.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very confident in opi.  the shade is perfect for the time of year.  packing was carried out in a professional manner.  thnk you!!</li>
    <li> It is a gorgeous color, but too many coats needed.  I had read another review that said a similar thing, but I kinda assumed they were exaggerating....but they weren&#x27;t.  I had to put 4-5 coats on to get the pretty color you see on the bottle, vs 2 coats for other OPI colors.  That will teach me to take those reviews a little more seriously</li>
    <li> This is my go- to color this summer! Bright and happy and as OPI never disappoints in the quality department.</li>
    <li> Great product, long lasting. I love the color. Lasts about 7 days for toenails and 3 for finger nails. Depends how many dishes you have to wash :)</li>
    <li> I get compliments all the time on this color.  It&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous!  OPI colors in my opinion are the best.</li>
    <li> I started using OPI when I found out that was what my manicurist was using. It does not flake and chip off easily!</li>
    <li> Just because I ordered a color that was too bright for my taste, I cannot fault OPI!  This is the best nail polish I have ever used.  I use the base coat and a top coat.  LOVE this polish no matter what the color..</li>
    <li> Great blue/pink. It is a great summer color. My nieces borrowed mine this summer and loved it so much I bought them a bottle.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color. It is bright pink and the color is true to the picture. (why is there a word minimum on these reviews? How much can you say about nail polish?)</li>
    <li> I love opi  and i love the color. It is definitely worth the money in my opinion. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Seems to be good product and great color. The quality about the same as other OPI products. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Bought this just by the color swatch online and boy am I glad. It is fairly bright, just like pink tulips, but a perfect summer color! My pedicurist said it was a HUGE seller this summer. You won&#x27;t be sorry with this color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the hot pink as shown in the picture, but more of a dark tickle me pink. I still like it, though. Of course since it&#x27;s OPI the polish lasts. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a decent collection of various Opi nail polishes, including Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer colors. This is hands down my favorite one. It&#x27;s such a bright, happy color! It goes on very smoothly, and makes my nails look fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the Opi shades I use (particularly the ones with shimmer) really need at least two coats to look good. I can get by with just one coat with this polish, and less layers &#x3D; less chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also makes a fantastic base coat for the sparkly and shimmery polishes. I&#x27;m currently wearing it under Pedal Faster Suzi! (part of the Holland collection) and the combination is gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love.</li>
    <li> OPI is by far the best fingernail polish I have ever used.  Way better than Orly.  It doesn&#x27;t peel and it didn&#x27;t chip for well over a week.  If I am going to spend time painting my nails it had better last.  Only reason for 4 stars is due to the long dry time and the need for 2 coats.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect shade I was looking for!  It goes on smoothly and stays on well, like all of the O P I shades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty color....a rasberry pink.  I took it with me to have a pedicure and everything went great.  No sticking or clumping.</li>
    <li> I recently had a pedicure, and I asked for this color - it&#x27;s gorgeous!  I couldn&#x27;t find it in local stores and turned to my go-to website!  OPI is my favorite brand and this is my new favorite color for spring/summer!</li>
    <li> It was the perfect shade and the polish glides on nicely. This was a great purchase. I would definitely order another.</li>
    <li> Even in person it&#x27;s as pink and pretty as it is online.  It is a great, bright color for the spring and summer seasons.</li>
    <li> The color isn&#x27;t what I expected. I expected the pink to be neon like the nails in the picture. However, if you look closely, it&#x27;s moreso the same color as the one in the bottle. It&#x27;s a pretty color but not bright like I wanted.</li>
    <li> I saw this online a few months ago and wanted it then but when I went to Ulta to get a bottle, they did not carry it anymore. I had assumed it wasn&#x27;t meant to be until I FINALLY found it on here! I&#x27;m so glad I got it! It&#x27;s beautiful and classy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus, I got it cheaper than if I would have gotten it from the store haha!!</li>
    <li> Love OPI polish.  This is a very nice color and a much better price than you&#x27;d pay in a salon.</li>
    <li> This is an adorable color for summer, I get compliments on it all the time! It has become a summer staple color ;)</li>
    <li> This is a great color and I absolutely love it.  Very bright and poppy.  I use it either by its self on my nails or with a coat of the Shatterd Black over it.  Both look great.</li>
    <li> This nail polish has already gotten me countless compliments. The shipping was fast and easy. I RECOMMEND for the trendy nail polish seekers! The color is very bright and perfect for spring/summer. Does not easily chip and lasts pretty long. I&#x27;m an experienced nail polish purchaser and paint my nails constantly - so - I know what makes a good nail polish good...and this is it!</li>
    <li> This is a great spring/summer color.  Like most of the OPI colors, it&#x27;s good quality and looks great with 2 coats.  Definitely one of my new favorite colors.</li>
    <li> I TOTALLY LOVE THIS COLOR, I THOUGHT I HAD ALL MY FAVORITE COLORS, UNTIL I SAW THIS ONE, AND WHEN I GOT IT IT WAS EVERYTHING THEY SAID IT WAS, I JUST FEEL BAD BECAUSE I BOUGHT FEW OTHER COLORS AND I HAVENT USED THEM CUZ I DONT WANT TO TAKE THIS ONE OFF. :)</li>
    <li> Love the tone of pink!  The package arrived pn time and in perfect shape. It&#x27;s a good idea to order also a fast dryer lacquer.</li>
    <li> Very pretty bright pink nail polish.Glad I bought ,shows my tan up well. Will buy again . Very pretty on toes</li>
    <li> Happy with opi , nice color, good summer color,I would reccoment to a friend, got it at an ok price.</li>
    <li> Nail polish is very hard to pick out from a picture; however, I can&#x27;t believe how the picture of this polish is a perfect match to how it looks on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the right consistency and it glides on easily but doesn&#x27;t run.  It covers beautifully in one coat but two is best.  If I use a top coat over the polish I get a good three weeks without chips or wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great polish for a great price.</li>
    <li> i love the color. it meets all expectations, perfect for many of my outfits. you should give it a try</li>
    <li> Great Color!!! I love OPI nail polish and have used OPI for over ten years!! Would order in the future</li>
