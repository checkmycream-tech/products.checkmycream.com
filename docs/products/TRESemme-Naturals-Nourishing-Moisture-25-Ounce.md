      <li>It leaves my hair smelling wonderful, it has the same smell as the flawless curls conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love, love, and love it!!!</li>
      <li>After I wash my hair with Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful Juicy shampoo bar (another winner for dry hair care), I coat my coils with either a quarter size amount of Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil or Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful Vanilla Latte hair oil.</li>
      <li>but it is sulfate free and very good</li>
      <li>I heard it was great before the formula change, but from what I hear, it can be used as a leave in better now because there&#x27;s no rubbing alcohol in it anymore.</li>

      <li>I love this conditioner!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>This conditioner is amazing.</li>
      <li>but this stuff works well on its own.</li>
      <li>It stayed nice and curly all day and untangled.  </li>
      <li>honestly, can you beat the price?  </li>
      <li>It lovingly hugs each strand and nurtures it with avocado oil and aloe vera.</li>
      <li>The primary ones I like are As I am and Beautiful textures products, but this conditioner is very smooth and it gives me plenty of slip.</li>
      <li>Excellent for natural, relaxed, and color-treated hair.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft, hydrated, no silicones and, the best part, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>I started making my own shampoo but haven&#x27;t been able to make a conditioner</li>
      <li>I thought.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the conditioner, but I wanted to make sure I had all the facts</li>
      <li>This was recommended by my hair stylist since I have curly but very fine / thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>kind of noticed that my hair is becoming somewhat wavy.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth and it leaves my hair feeling hydrated.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use it and have a huge bottle!</li>
      <li>Not awful, just a bit..</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Better fragrance as well</li>
      <li>I was searching for a cleansing conditioner that detangled my hair, did not contain EDTA or parabens, did not contain silicone or proteins, contained cetyl alcohol, was animal cruelty free and was AFFORDABLE!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>why but my hair just seemed to drink that stuff up way better.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m sooo glad I got it.</li>
      <li>Like the rest of this line the smell was fabulous!</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this conditioner.</li>
      <li>this is a great conditioner, it really moisturize my hair.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>So I don&#x27;t use it the way most probably do.</li>
      <li>Ok, I need to stop, you get the point.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>its okay</li>
      <li>I reluctantly bought it and found it to be better than the Redken and the Joico.  </li>
      <li>I just haven&#x27;t had to because the results from straight conditioning worked great.  </li>
      <li>I love this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>A friend recommended and I am glad she did.</li>
      <li>The best part, it&#x27;s only $5 at Walmart and Target.  </li>
      <li>Hair is shiny and healthy with springy frizz-free curls.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I really do love this conditioner.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can see the difference. Its a really good conditioner</li>
    <li> I love that it is paraben free but that&#x27;s were it ends. I seem to leave a heavy residue in my hair and causes my scalp to itch. I can&#x27;t use it and have a huge bottle!</li>
    <li> I have switched to the Naturals line for both shampoo and conditioner.  I love it.  Makes my hair soft and shiny, and I swear I don&#x27;t have to wash it as much!  I&#x27;ve heard that all of the chemicals they put in most shampoos actually make your scalp produce more oil, so you&#x27;re forced to wash it more.  I think I&#x27;ve found my proof!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner!  It&#x27;s great for my 3b curls.  I use as a co-wash, conditioner and leave-in. Hair is shiny and healthy with springy frizz-free curls. I hope this product stays around forever!</li>
    <li> this is a great conditioner, it really moisturize my hair. I will recommend this to everyone no matter what hair type.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use products like Pantene, Finesse, Herbal Essence, Aussie, and Garnier because my hair just gets so terribly dried out!! This has been the only product that I have been able to use long term with continually fabulous results. My friends ask me all the time how my hair is so soft, healthy, and manageable. I think it&#x27;s a combination of things. I avoid blow drying daily and use a tourmaline dryer if I do, get my hair trimmed regularly, take vitamins, eat healthy, always use conditioner, and using a good shampoo &amp; conditioner set makes a huge difference. All the hair products from the brands I mentioned before put my hair on the fritz and this hair product fixed it up. I am a happy girl with happy hair!!    Oh speaking of happy hair... I am Korean with thick, fine hair. This works really well for me :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural conditioner for my curly haired toddler.  She always has this one chunk that turns into a big &amp;#34;dread lock&amp;#34; throughout the day.  I didn&#x27;t want to start putting stuff on her hair so young, but I needed something.  After just ONE use her hair is so soft, the dread lock undid itself without me having to brush it out like I normally do-and I&#x27;m met with whining and complaining.  It stayed nice and curly all day and untangled.  I haven&#x27;t tried using it as a leave-in like I had intended based on the reviews I read.  I just haven&#x27;t had to because the results from straight conditioning worked great.  The best part, it&#x27;s only $5 at Walmart and Target.  I&#x27;m so glad I found something without harsh chemicals that actually works and is reasonably priced.  Sometimes I feel like it can only be legitimately natural if it&#x27;s from one of the expensive brands, but that simply isn&#x27;t the case here.</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner of all time, &#x27;John Freida Curl Around&#x27;, is getting harder to find. When that happens, it usually means it&#x27;s about to be discontinued so I was on the hunt again for another awesome conditioner. I have natural African American 3c hair that needs tons of moisture. I heard a lot of positive things about Tresseme Naturals Nourishing Moisture Conditioner so I tried it. I absolutely LOVE this conditioner. Though it&#x27;s not excessively thick, it&#x27;s not watery thin either. It gives me plenty of slip so I can comb my hair in the shower quickly and easily, smells great and costs less than six bucks for a 25 oz bottle. After I wash my hair with Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful Juicy shampoo bar (another winner for dry hair care), I coat my coils with either a quarter size amount of Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil or Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful Vanilla Latte hair oil. After a braid out, my hair looks and smells great in the morning. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about hoarding &#x27;Curl Around&#x27; - I&#x27;ve found my new conditioner!</li>
    <li> I researched and found this line that it&#x27;s not available in Puerto Rico. So I&#x27;m sooo glad I got it. The only flaw is that the actual product came with a pump. The picture did not have a pump. And also it kinda exploded not much though.</li>
    <li> wow first use. i used it on my hair and the extension i have it. i left it in my hair and omg it is so smooth and soft and tangle free. I love it. smells great too. i love natural products. Great job</li>
    <li> I need a conditioner that is going to help my hair not to become damaged at the ends or dry, but also does not weigh my hair down. My hair also gets tangled easily after I shower. This conditioner does a great job! It does not contain silicone, which tends to coat the hair and makes it so that the natural oils can&#x27;t penetrate the hair follicle, which contributes to more damage. I use along with [[ASIN:B003RSSBXK Tresemme Naturals Nourishing Moisture Shampoo - 25 oz]].</li>
    <li> I started using these products on me and my daughters hair because we are transiting from a perm to natural and we love the way our hair feels.  Its very soft, easy to comb, our hair is moisturized and never dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner along with the matching shampoo for at least a month on my daughters, and their hair looks really good, it really helps with the tangles. My wavy haired daughter is no longer frizzy or dried out looking, nor does it weigh her hair down. I think this conditioner is pretty thick, thicker than the Herbal Essences or Suave we have used in the past, and my kids&#x27; hair looks better with this product. I rated the conditioner a 5 and the shampoo only a 4 simply because I am not crazy about the shampoo for my color treated, tangly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price, and easy to find in stores as well as on Amazon.</li>
    <li> One of the factors that affected my decision to purchase this Aloe Vera and Advocado Oil Tresemme conditioner naturals nourishing moisture (25 ounce bottle) from my job was the affordability coupled with this conditioner containing ingredients that I sense would fully condition my hair. Fortunately, this hair conditioner met my expectations and I would obviously purchase it again because of how well it works at an inexpensive/reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Tresemme products, so when I was looking for a natural conditioner for my hair (I&#x27;m a black women with 4 a/b type hair) I was glad to see this one on top of the list. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s hypoallergenic, so if you have sensitive skin or other issues, this would be great for you. It has less ingredients than regular conditioner (It&#x27;s true; just put it side by side with regular conditioner) and it is thinner than regular conditioner (for those of you who like to co-wash, this will be excellent for you because it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave residue or build-up in your hair). The smell is very light and lovely, not full of perfume like all those other conditioners (which is good if you have a sensitive nose). Also, if you have color-treated hair (like I do) this is excellent for it. Out of all the conditioners I&#x27;ve used, this is the only one that didn&#x27;t make my hair look dull and washed out. In fact, it actually brightens your hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I recommend this conditioner to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. The only thing is , is that this conditioners smell is extremely strong. I have a lot of hair so at times it became a little overwhelming , but all in all this is a wonderful conditioner and the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I luv this conditioner. I use this to wash my  hair without instead of harsh shampoos. its smells great and it leaves my hair soft and clean. I have type 4c African American hair. if you are looking to get your hair back healthy or going natural or even going with a textlaxed this is a great cowash product to have in your hair care kit. I also found it at walmart for only $4.34. I will be buying my next bottle from walmart instead of ordering online and paying shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use it as a Cowash as well as my leave-in conditioner and I love it.  Great product for Natural Hair!</li>
    <li> Nice alternative to the regular TRESemme conditioner which leaves my scalp a little itchy. Better fragrance as well</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is.  But this conditioner really loves my hair and my hair loves it right back.  It&#x27;s thick; but not heavy or greasy.  It lovingly hugs each strand and nurtures it with avocado oil and aloe vera. Maybe because it is silicone free; but my hair performs really well with this conditioner.  Before I apply any other styling aids in my hair, I apply this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And honestly, can you beat the price?  I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> I purchased a bottle of Tresemme Naturals Nourishing Moisture WAAAAYYYYYY back in January of 2013, before they changed the formula to the s*** black-capped sludge that the company is now trying to pass off as the same conditioner. I&#x27;ll admit, I did not like the conditioner at first so I switched products. At the time I was on a quest to find the perfect leave in, and I could not afford a $12 bottle of Kinky Curly Knot Today. I had heard good reviews so I tried this. I had been using it as my co-wash and didn&#x27;t like it, so I set the bottle in my &#x27;reject&#x27; pile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, curly 3b-3c hair. Finding a leave-in that was not too heavy or greasy but still left my hair feeling moisturized AND played well with other products was a time consuming, frustrating and increasingly expensive project-one that produced very poor results. My poor hair was so stressed out. I don&#x27;t know why I decided to try this as a leave in, but I did-and was shocked at the results. My hair looked great after I did it. Felt great too! This particular formula (white cap with a green top) is amazing. It is lightweight, moisturizing, has no scent, and it works. It works like a charm. Detangling is not a problem for me any longer with the Tresemme Naturals. This is one of the few conditioners that works well for my difficult hair type. My only problem is that the company changed the formula and it now is crap. I never used the new formula, I have quite a bit of my old product left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was terrified of what will happen when I eventually do run out, so I&#x27;ve been running around to various stores desperately trying to find a bottle of the old formula. I got lucky and discovered that a certain drugstore still has overstock of the old formula, so I bought three bottles. Should last me at least two years (I don&#x27;t go through product quickly at all). I really do love this conditioner. It functioned beautifully as a co-wash too, but now I switch back and forth between Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying (which I may stop using because I am starting to find it very drying and stripping) and Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle (which I love for the ingredients, scent and light consistency).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this conditioner and if you are a curly girl and are lucky enough to find a bottle of the old formula, you should try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***FOR THE RECORD**** The old formula is the one in the white bottle with the white cap and the green flip top. The one with the black cap and green flip top is the dupe, and the terrible one. I have heard nothing but bad things about that one.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I love this conditioner as a cowash. It has excellent slip and it makes my hair super soft and moisturized. It&#x27;s not too expensive and it works great!</li>
    <li> Great product for my 4C hair</li>
    <li> I like it .. it&#x27;s a great in between wash day conditioner to get me by , I use it as a rinse out &amp; leave in on my natural type 4 hair .. will purchase again &amp; again .. I get mine at Walmart for $4 or $5</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to purcahse this particular conditioner after I read on several websites that the new formula doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old one. I eventually decided that since I&#x27;ve never actually tried the old formula, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try the new one. So I bought it and used it a few times and... I actually really like it. It smells nice, has a very thick consistency, and leaves my hair soft and bouncy.</li>
    <li> I love the old formula, but I ran out, and all the store had was this new formula, with the black top, I HATE IT!!!! They should have stuck with the old formula, the new conditioner leaves my hair very dull, no slip at all and no moisture. WHY did they change it? Please bring the old conditioner back!!!!</li>
    <li> I now have soft shiny hair instead of course brittle hair. A friend recommended and I am glad she did.</li>
    <li> This conditioner didn&#x27;t feel the same as the one you could buy in the store.  I&#x27;m not sure what it is but something was off about it.</li>
    <li> I love  this conditioner sooo much, that i use it as a co wash in substitution with my As I Am Coconut Cleansing Co Wash to switch every two weeks apart. And I loovvee the smell and get amount of slip with it too.</li>
    <li> I have been on the search for a hair care routine for years and years and years. My  hair is highlighted, long, and very dry/coarse/damage/split...it needed help. I picked up this conditioner to use as a CO-washer (conditioner only washing). So I don&#x27;t use it the way most probably do. I actually use this conditioner to wash my hair instead of shampoo, rinse, and then add some more to the ends. I love that it is silicone free (a must for CO-washing) and I love the way it smells...floral/fruity but not overpowering. This is seriously the first and only product in my many-a-year search for hydrated hair that actually makes my hair feel and look smooth and shiny. Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that I don&#x27;t use shampoo or maybe its the fact that this stuff just ROCKS.</li>
    <li> Mostly great ingredients. I use it weekly for co-washing and after cleansing my type 4 natural hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner, and feels much more gentle than the regular TRESemme.</li>
    <li> This, too, was highly recommended by a YouTube contributor.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!&lt;br /&gt;She recommended adding other essential oils to make it a really deep conditioner (for those of us whose locks need extra moisture), so that is exactly what I did.  Works excellently.</li>
    <li> I loveeeee this conditioner!  It allows me to detangle my hair sooooooo much quicker! It is one of my staple products.</li>
    <li> i have long curly hair and this is excellent.</li>
    <li> it smells so good! and it makes my hair so soft and curly and i can get through my hair so much easier than ever! and the best part no Silicone in it.</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s very long, natural hair. It makes detangling a tear-free process. Her hair is so soft and manageable after applying this conditioner. Oh, and it smells great also! I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Within minutes of using this conditioner on my hair, I started to have tightness in my chest, hands got red, and I could not breathe. Within an hour, I felt like I would collapse from lack of breathing. I was having Anaphylaxis and got very dizzy I thought I would pass out, my limbs were going weak. No I didn&#x27;t use my epi-pen, never had to use it but was about to! I have a severe tree nut allergy and didn&#x27;t realize the Fordi Oil/TUNG OIL in this conditioner is a tree nut oil. This bottle says hypoallergenic, and this is false advertising for allergy sufferers like myself. Had to wash my hair out thoroughly with my canus goat milk bar soap, take benedryl, prednisone, nebulizer and albutrol for it to subside. Even mop my floors/ bathtub from where the product dripped. Days later I am having bouts of asthma attacks and my eczema has flared on my hands. Eating food has proved difficult, because I feel like I am choking alot. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I started making my own shampoo but haven&#x27;t been able to make a conditioner I that I like. In the meantime I wanted something Paraben free and this seems to fit the bill. I have been using it for almost a year now. It&#x27;s a light creme texture, rinses off cleanly and leaves my fine hair soft and bouncy. I have chin-length hair and this bottle lasted almost 12 months, so for me it&#x27;s a good value. Will be ordering another bottle.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a cleansing conditioner that detangled my hair, did not contain EDTA or parabens, did not contain silicone or proteins, contained cetyl alcohol, was animal cruelty free and was AFFORDABLE! Here it is. I don&#x27;t need to look anywhere else. This is perfection!    It&#x27;s a slightly thin consistency which is exactly what I wanted because I didn&#x27;t want my conditioner to leave any residue behind and I felt that thicker conditioners did that. It has a fresh yet inviting scent, not overpowering yet just enough punch.     I had very dry hair before I stopped using sulfates, now I wash my hair with this and only this. I purchased a 1-L pump for it so it&#x27;s easy to access in the shower. It&#x27;s amazing and I love it.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to get the Tresemme Naturals with the white top like in the picture, instead I received the bottle with the black top and the new formula.</li>
    <li> I have VERY damaged 3b hair and TREsemme conditioner SILCONE FREE is the bomb! That is, for my hair it is the BEST conditioner. I use it to wash my hair, I use it as a leave in and  I use it as a conditioner.  The best part is that TREsemme SILCONE FREE is affordable.  TRUST, I have bought and tried many supposedly silcone, paraben free product, but TREsemme is the best for my hair type. Just recently I have had trouble finding it in my usual stores: Target, Giant, RiteAid, CVS, and Shoppers. Where oh where did it go?</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this conditioner. I started my curly hair journey, to get my hair even more healthier. I jump back and forth between this and the TRESemme Flawless Curls conditioner. It leaves my hair smelling wonderful, it has the same smell as the flawless curls conditioner. It also has no silicone in it! My hair is more softer than before, and frizzes less often. Just know that I do not put on shampoo, only conditioner. At first your hair will be VERY weighed down for about a week and oily. After 3 weeks of washing every 4th or 5th day your hair will get used to only using this conditioner. Now my hair is softer and less frizzy than it was before. I also have a small patch of hair in the back that doesn&#x27;t have much of a curl pattern, which was always prone to frizz A LOT, now, its sleek. Still a little frizzy, but definitely not as dry and puffy.</li>
    <li> I use this when conditioning my hair along with the Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Conditioner. It smells amazing and is very moisturizing. It arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> So I have naturally curly and wavy hair. My hair responds different to different products, and I am quite sure a lot of people can relate to this. First of all, the price of this deserves a thumb up. It has gone up over the years, but I can not complain since it is still under ten bucks. Let me just say that I use this for a co-wash, leave-in at times, and even as a deep conditioner. It&#x27;s so versatile. Because it is silicone free, my hair absorbs the maximum conditioning properties from the oils and it just softens my hair like a baby&#x27;s shampoo. My curls are easier to manage, softer, and less frizzy. This is perfect to use year round! I love, love, and love it!!! If Tresemme ever took this off the market or changed the formula, I would lose it because this stuff is all that and a bag of chip, with a subway footlong on the side ;)</li>
    <li> I gave this four stars because I just started using it. But so far I there are no problems with it. I was really afraid to waste my money (its $5 in stores amazon why is it so overpriced?) because many recent reviews have said that the new formulation is not as good as the old one, many say that it does not have slip anymore. I never used TRES Naturals so I cannot compare it. But it gave me just as much slip for ME, as my Aussie Moist conditioner that has cones which I am trying to stay away from. Hopefully it can become a staple.</li>
    <li> Great for detangling.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, hydrated, no silicones and, the best part, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner, perfect amount of slip, and light enough to use for daily no-poo use.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it is grossly overpriced here.  You can buy this for practically nothing at Walmart or Target.  Of course, I tend to buy things on Amazon because I can&#x27;t get to the store, but if you can, by all means do so -- you&#x27;ll save yourself a LOT of money.  But as for the product itself, I am a (former) product snob who would have never purchased a Tresemme product a year ago....and here I am to tell you that this stuff is FANTASTIC.  I have a sensitive scalp and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, which is highly unusual.  It leaves my thick,coarse, curly hair soft, shiny, and manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in place of shampoo for a couple of months now and I&#x27;ll never go back. Every once in awhile I&#x27;ll use a conditioning cleanser to augment it but this stuff works well on its own. My hair has fewer fly-aways, is more hydrated and generally looks better. Just makes sure you really heap it on at the start of your shower and leave it on for at least 8-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one problem was that the increased oil in my hear (no no, it doesn&#x27;t look oily, I swear) has caused a bit of seborrheic dermatitis behind my ears.</li>
    <li> NEWS FLASH (This is based on the new non publicized formula change where isopropyl alcohol has been removed and replaced with a neutral one... benzene (sp) alcohol, low on the ingredients list.  Also the oils have moved up the ingredients list!!!)&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I have a story with this one.  I am so pleased with the results. I am African American and have naturally curly 3c hair. This legitimately so awesome!  My hair was soft AND hydrated, NO silicone in this product.  Now for those with natural hair, I did a wash and go with this as my rinse out conditioner.  I could tell a BIG difference.  My hair was defined and SOOOO soft. I use Paul Mitchell The Conditioner as my leave in with Eco Styler w/ argon.  This is the best conditioner and I have gotten the best results.  I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit of a product snob and would only use professional products.  I would stock up once a year in July when Beauty Brand had their liter sale... all Professional liters for $11.99 (went up a dollar this year). Well, in May I found out that Redken was discontinuing their Smooth Down line.  I was floored!  Joico Moisture Recovery is a great second but I don&#x27;t care for the smell. So I went on a hunt. A friend that has been natural for 6 years told me about this one.  I reluctantly bought it and found it to be better than the Redken and the Joico.  I also love As I Am Coconut cowash but even that is second to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Because there are no silicones my hair is TRULY moisturized.  I got great softness and definition with my regimen. You would think gel would leave it crunchy, but when you have a great rinse out conditioner and leave in, you can scrunch your hair once it dries and it comes out SUPER soft and defined.  My hair was REALLY hydrated AND soft. Ok, I need to stop, you get the point.  But I hope they never discontinue this.  However I am now grateful that Redken discontinued Smooth Down, I can&#x27;t believe what I was missing.  I mean really... myfriends know me.  Spending $4.77 per bottle at Walmart??? I can&#x27;t beleive how good this stuff is.  I heard it was great before the formula change, but from what I hear, it can be used as a leave in better now because there&#x27;s no rubbing alcohol in it anymore.</li>
    <li> I finally took the plunge and decided to give this conditioner a shot. I was already using regular Tresemme Moisture Rich and Flawless Curls, but didn&#x27;t really want to try this just yet because it was a smaller bottle for more money. (NOT MUCH MORE!! But still... Smaller for more!)  I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but my hair had started feeling \\&quot;funky\\&quot; using the regular one. Not awful, just a bit.. \\&quot;Off.\\&quot; I tend to overnight condition my hair, so I gathered maybe the cones in the regular versions were just sitting on top of my hair and coating it, but not really doing anything for it. So I decided to just take the chance and get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  And the first time it hit my hair.... It was clear. This is better than the original formulas. When I put it on after lathering up with my L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme shampoo (My LOOOOOVE!!!) it seemed to just soak into my hair- In a GREAT way!! Like it was actually DOING something, not just sitting on top! After my overnight condition, my hair was soft and ready for the world! My style looked better and my hair FELT better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I know the hair \\&quot;scientists\\&quot; will say nothing soaks into your hair. It&#x27;s all just coating, But SOMETHING happened after using this product.... And I LIKED it! :)</li>
    <li> Much better than the regular tresemme. Price was very reasonable, the bottle takes me awhile to finish since it is very large. Smell is great. It moisturized my hair wonderfully. I will definitely buy product again.</li>
    <li> Tresemme Natural Nourishing Moisture Conditioner is my favorite conditioner. Excellent for natural, relaxed, and color-treated hair.  It also makes a great leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product (not on Amazon) and use it as a leave-in conditioner/detangler on my wet natural 4a/4b hair. I don&#x27;t really LOVE how my hair feels after it dries, but when I use it, it cuts down my detangling time dramatically. As this mane keeps rapidly growing that is becoming a higher priority! I think I may add some more avocado oil to the bottle and see if that helps. I&#x27;m also going to try blow drying after detangling (I normally just air dry -no heat) and see how it takes. It&#x27;s always an experiment! I will say...it&#x27;s definitely underpriced and of greater quality than one would think. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This does not moisturise my hair. When I put it on, my strands feel strange and stripped and I can&#x27;t wait to wash it off. I used it about 3 times so far and nothing has improved. Continuing on my search for a moisturising, protein-FREE conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the Tresemme brand but i bought this after seeing the great reviews given by curly girls and i&#x27;m so glad i did! I have very thick, coarse, very curly hair, in the 3C range and was looking for an affordable conditioner that i could condition and co-wash with. I had a great experience with this one and it left my hair feeling very moisturized and soft. This conditioner has a pleasantly fresh scent, a thick consistency, and provides LOTS of slip, which is great for detangling curly hair. I do recommend buying this in-store at Target or Walmart, if possible, because it&#x27;s much cheaper there, as it cost me $4.99, but if you live abroad, i think the slightly higher price is worth paying.</li>
    <li> This is great conditioner. Leaves my hair soft after each use. Better than the previous products I have used.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner for my hair and as shaving cream. It&#x27;s so rich and not too heavy. Item arrived on time so I could enjoy using it</li>
    <li> Item received as described.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my hair stylist since I have curly but very fine / thinning hair.  The heavier conditioners that I had previously used were weighing my hair down and since I have switched over to this one, I&#x27;ve seen an improvement.  Also, it makes my hair feel silky soft and I can use it every day.</li>
    <li> I started using TRESemme Naturals in February when I was getting tired of my hair being so brittle. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was due to my thyroid condition or the fact that I washed my hair with regular shampoo. I can&#x27;t use conditioner, either, considering that it caused me to break out horribly. However, I&#x27;ve started experiencing adult acne (I&#x27;m 31) for about six months, so I figured, &amp;#34;Oh, what the heck? I&#x27;ll give this conditioner a try. It&#x27;s not like my acne can get much worse than it already is.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this conditioner as a replacement to my shampoo has been wonderful. I workout every day, and I normally shower a short time after. It took me a while to discover a routine that would get my clean hair to the point to where I didn&#x27;t feel like it was full of wax (thanks, sweat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While showering, I&#x27;d first rinse my hair thoroughly while massaging with my fingers; I spend a good amount of time doing that before adding conditioner (massaging into my hair and on my scalp really well), after washing my body and after using my &amp;#34;shower time&amp;#34; skincare soaps. So, I run water through my hair about three times. I&#x27;d also like to point out that I use this conditioner every four days and use the &amp;#34;water only&amp;#34; method during the other days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has there been no waxy buildup for the past couple of weeks, but this conditioner doesn&#x27;t interfere with my newly established skincare routine (started both at the same time). It&#x27;s been a great complement to my acne routine, and my hair and face/neck look and feel a lot healthier. Much cleaner, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered another bottle since I&#x27;m 1/4 away from having an empty one. I love this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of noticed that my hair is becoming somewhat wavy. I can&#x27;t explain that. I actually like it. I&#x27;m tired of having completely straight hair. Haha!</li>
    <li> I have super fine strait fly away hair that has been damaged by the world&#x27;s worst perm, and flat iron damage. After about a year of dealing with dry frizzy hair I discovered this conditioner. I have tried so many other products, and none work as well as this one. It goes on very smooth and it leaves my hair feeling hydrated. It does not look frizzy any more, and it feels soft! I do not use any hair cream afterwards (it gives me acne).I have shoulder length hair, and it takes 4 pumps to coat my hair. Two for the ends, 2 for the roots. (Oh, and yes, it comes with a pump, which the picture does not show. ) I have been using it a little over a month now, and Its only half gone! Of course, if you have longer or thicker hair, you will use it faster than I do. Overall, it&#x27;s just a great product , and I&#x27;m hooked!!!</li>
    <li> The conditioner works very well for my hair which is medium curly and gets tangled and dry if I don&#x27;t use the conditioner.  I was surprised that this purchase came from Target and not the Di Bruno Bros as advertised.  It does not matter to me which seller it comes from as long as it came on time and at the price that I agreed to pay.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner will buy again.</li>
    <li> A great amount of conditioner for the price. I have kinky/curly hair and it is great for detangling, and occasionally i use some as leave-in.</li>
    <li> I am the biggest product junkie in the world but something always brings me back to this conditioner. It smells HEAVENLY which is an automatic win, and it leaves my curls so defined, soft, and shiny. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I know why this is a naturalistas staple its so good from the smell to the texture. it may not be NATURAL per say but it is sulfate free and very good</li>
    <li> I bought this product as I presumed that it was not tested on animals as the back of their bottles say in nice big letters &#x27;THIS PRODUCT IS NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS&#x27;. Great I thought.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the conditioner, but I wanted to make sure I had all the facts and so I did a little research on Tresemme. I&#x27;m sad to say that Tresemme&#x27;s parent company is Unilever, one of the biggest cosmetic animal testing companies in the world - after Proctor &amp; Gamble.&lt;br /&gt;Quite honestly, stating &#x27;Not tested on animals&#x27; on the reverse of the bottle is tricking customers...I won&#x27;t be buying Tresemme again as though they may state that this conditioner &#x27;technically&#x27; isn&#x27;t tested on animals - the ingredients are.&lt;br /&gt;We know this because a) they don&#x27;t say that their ingredients are not tested on animals b) their parent company is Unilever which does test on animals, so even if the Tresemme brand isn&#x27;t doing the testing themselves, they are using ingredients tested on animals by Unilever.  Because the ingredients are being tested by another company, and not by themselves, they can get trickily state &#x27;the product is not tested on animals&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Tricky old Tresemme... If you bought this conditioner - like me - because you&#x27;re anti-animal testing, then you&#x27;ll want to avoid Tresemme in future.</li>
    <li> OMG....i didnt know a conditioner could get my curls so defined. It feels great in my hair and just leaves my curls springing. Has a good slip. Great price for how much you get $4(walmart).I absolutely love this product. Soo glad i tried it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s great to use as a cowash between shampoos, detangles my hair, moisturizes, can be used as a leave in and mixed as a deep conditioner, I can use it for both my type 4 kinks and my son&#x27;s type 3 curls, plus it&#x27;s under 5 bucks in stores. Definitely a staple in my house</li>
    <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.  TRESEMME  changed the formula for this product.  They received so many complaints that they have gone back to the original formula.  At the time I ordered this from Amazon,  I could not find the old formula anywhere locally.  When I ordered the product I ordered the white cap and the words certified organic on the back of the bottle.  The new formula has a black cap and black TRESemme blocked in on the label.  Unfortunately this is NOT the formula I ordered and I will be returning it immediately.  Talk about false advertising!  I was willing to pay almost double for the same size bottle I used to be able to get locally and actually bought four bottles and all of them have the black top and black label and are not organic certified.  NOPE...NOT SATISFIED AT ALL!</li>
    <li> Love this as a deep conditioner.  Really coats the hair well and makes it soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> uhh its a regular conditioner, nothing too spectacular... it has great slip but i wouldnt buy this again.. its okay</li>
    <li> I have been going natural for about 2 yrs. And I have just beginning to learn and become overwhelmed with all the natural products out there. The primary ones I like are As I am and Beautiful textures products, but this conditioner is very smooth and it gives me plenty of slip. I use it after I shampoo with beautiful textures....its pretty nice</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this conditioner in France so I have to come here to buy it. I love it. I have 4 type of hair and I can easily detangle with it. It&#x27;s really moistuzing and I LOVE the smell! I received the ones with the black/green cap and it&#x27;s the one I&#x27;m used to. I don&#x27;t know anything about the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formula, this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula works for me, my hair says yes.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever tried. It had good slip, left my hair feeling soft, and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Like the rest of this line the smell was fabulous! It does a decent job of keeping my hair moisturized and aids in detangling. I still prefer the vibrantly smooth conditioner. I wish I had a solid reason why but my hair just seemed to drink that stuff up way better. This left my hair a tad bit on the dry side but it could be these winter months coming in. I have ordered my second round of the vibrantly smooth and I will be sure to update if it really is the temperatures outside making my hair dryer. Overall still pretty good. I would buy this only if the vibrantly smooth wasn&#x27;t available, which surprisingly is a lot of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still a staple, actually this is my go to conditioner rarely use anything else 4 something hair, African American</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing. It provides enough slip to easily de-tangle hair and keeps the hair moisturized way after it has been rinsed out. I also use it as a leave-in conditioner and I have seen my hair flourish. Would definitely recommend if you are having problems with breakage and dry ends. Hope this helps!</li>
