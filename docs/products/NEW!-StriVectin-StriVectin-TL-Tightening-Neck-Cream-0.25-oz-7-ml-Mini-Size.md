### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This sample size container is perfect for travel and it arrived promptly from the Seller so no complaints there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that using it two to three times a day renders the best result.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>and I am happy with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>I think this is a really good product.</li>
      <li>They are usually good.</li>
      <li>This is the lowest price out there, and this is a good size for travel.</li>
      <li>My skin feels great, looks healthy.  </li>
      <li>I love all of Strivectin&#x27;s products!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to know of better, more effective products, so please let me know about them by replying to this review.</li>
      <li>I really love this neck cream.</li>
      <li>I cannot comment on the effectiveness of it because you probably need to use this six weeks or more before you see results.  </li>
      <li>I have used their makeup for about 15 years now and I am 51 and most people think I am 40.</li>
      <li>I have purchased several of their products and resurfacing and moisturizer is the best.</li>
      <li>I have read many reviews of this and everyone says \\&quot;give it</li>
      <li>I am most satisfied with this line of products.  </li>
      <li>Just one more product that claims to get results but does not.</li>
      <li>Still, I use it more routinely to maintain the smoothing effect.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a sweet, appealing fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong, chemically odor either, so I don&#x27;t mind the rather neutral smell.</li>
      <li>I get migraines, but this doesn&#x27;t smell strong enough to cause them, so that&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>Though this isn&#x27;t the best price per ounce, at under $15, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a substantial amount of sampling.</li>
      <li>There are many other products out there that claim to tighten the neck, so many it&#x27;s overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this one because of the availability of this sampler, better than the single- or double-use packets; because of familiarity with the name and StriVectin results onstretch marks and scars; and, finally, because even in full-sized tubs, it&#x27;s more affordable than others I&#x27;ve never even sampled to know if they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The things I do to try to look better is such a waste, I have so many products that I am handing them out to others to try.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I really did not expect it to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I did really like it.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work.  </li>
      <li>Afterwards, should you decide to purchase a full-sized bottle, it&#x27;s nice to put some from the large container into this small one.</li>
      <li>The lines are still there, but at least regular use gives it a more taut appearance, which is better than doing nothing about it.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product for older skin.  </li>
      <li>I could live with that.</li>
      <li>Finally a skin care product that really does what it claims!</li>
      <li>I have used Strivectin SD in the past and it worked really well with my fine lines and wrinkles</li>
      <li>Bought enough to equal 2 &amp; 3/4 full sized 1 oz jars.  </li>
      <li>In the 5 years I&#x27;ve been using the products, I&#x27;ve been told I look 10 years + less than my current age  : )</li>
      <li>However I was surprised to see a tighter neck.</li>
      <li>The cream really helps my skin&#x27;s overall appearance.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had oily skin that has made me picky about what I can wear, since many lotions and creams tend to make my skin feel smothered, greasy or dirty, but this cream is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother me much, especially considering the result.</li>
      <li>If you use this only on your neck you don&#x27;t need much so it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I used to have oily skin when I was young, but now in my upper fifties</li>
      <li>I thought I would try a small size before investing in the full size.  </li>
      <li>However, it was a very small size for the price, in fact in came in a box that read \\&quot;bonus free sample\\&quot;</li>

<li> but, I expected that with the heavy cream.</li>
<li> Or at least patch test a tiny area for a few days before putting it all over your neck.</li>
<li> That way it takes up less room in your bathroom drawer, travel bag or makeup pouch.</li>
<li> I will say that it has a distinct chemically /perfumey fragrance that I find very unpleasant, so beware if you have chemical sensitivities because this is on the neck and very close to the nose, it could be irritating</li>

    <li> Great product! Finally a skin care product that really does what it claims! I will be buying the BIG  jar next!</li>
    <li> I bought the sample size, as I sometimes have trouble with creams causing breakouts or irritation.  Even though I haven&#x27;t finished the sample yet, I think I can detect a change in the skin on my neck, and it definitely has not caused any problems or redness.  Anxious to see if improvement continues!</li>
    <li> This sample size container is perfect for travel and it arrived promptly from the Seller so no complaints there. I have read many reviews of this and everyone says \\&quot;give it a try it really does tighten and keep the neck firm and supple\\&quot;. It takes up to 8 weeks to achieve noticeble results, so we&#x27;ll see I have only used it once so I can&#x27;t report on it&#x27;s efficacy just yet. I will say that it has a distinct chemically /perfumey fragrance that I find very unpleasant, so beware if you have chemical sensitivities because this is on the neck and very close to the nose, it could be irritating and that is unfortunate, but not a deal breaker, as long as the visual results are satisfying.</li>
    <li> I really love this neck cream. It really works. I bought the small size so if it didn&#x27;t work I wouldn&#x27;t waste so much money. However I was surprised to see a tighter neck. I will order the larger size next time. If you use this only on your neck you don&#x27;t need much so it lasts a long time. I have used this company&#x27;s products before. They are usually good.</li>
    <li> This product works and does firm the neck.  I take this small size with me when I travel and I am happy with my purchase.  I am most satisfied with this line of products.  They work for me,</li>
    <li> Just one more product that claims to get results but does not. I couldn&#x27;t see any difference on my neck.</li>
    <li> This product I like because a little does the trick.  I&#x27;m just seeing if it works over time but it does seem to be working</li>
    <li> when the product arrived, the container was so small that i wondered how i would even get the cream out of it.  But that became much less of a problem when i opened the jar to find that the cream itself had completely congealed and could not be used.  I was very disappointed with this and am requesting a refund.</li>
    <li> I actually tried the sample pack with all three products. It included the stretch mark cream, neck cream and face cream. I purchased it for the neck cream. I used it twice a day for over a month and a half and did not see enough of a change to buy it again. If there was change, it was minimal and I cannot see it in my before and after pictures. I did get a few pimples but, I expected that with the heavy cream. I could live with that. The stretch mark cream did not work either but I really did not expect it to.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to my Neutrogena products and try something they have for the neck. I have used their makeup for about 15 years now and I am 51 and most people think I am 40. It is the only thing I used on my face until recently purchasing the Rapid Wrinkle Repair for around my eyes. i will just start using it on my neck and face too.</li>
    <li> The cream blistered my neck, but that was one of the side effects, so I took my chances and lost.  Oh, well.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Saw results in tightening and firming neck and face areas.  Would recommend without question and will purchase and continue to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this size on Amazon and eBay.  Bought enough to equal 2 &amp; 3/4 full sized 1 oz jars.  Used it twice a day for over 10 weeks.  Took before and after photos for comparison.  Not one bit of difference.  I can&#x27;t comment on crepe skin because I don&#x27;t have any on my neck.  But tightens the skin?  No way.  Too expensive.  I wish I could give it no stars.</li>
    <li> I could have used lotion and got same results.  I have purchased several of their products and resurfacing and moisturizer is the best.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work.  I have used Strivectin SD in the past and it worked really well with my fine lines and wrinkles so thought this would work as well.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I put it on my neck I get something that looks like a sunburn where ever I put it.  I am now trying it by mixing with another cream in the hope that will help.  So far, no change, Now I am thinking of trying their other product that is just a neck cream to see if that would help.&lt;br /&gt;The things I do to try to look better is such a waste, I have so many products that I am handing them out to others to try.&lt;br /&gt;If I can get a result I will come back to update.</li>
    <li> Though this isn&#x27;t the best price per ounce, at under $15, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a substantial amount of sampling. Afterwards, should you decide to purchase a full-sized bottle, it&#x27;s nice to put some from the large container into this small one. That way it takes up less room in your bathroom drawer, travel bag or makeup pouch. Despite being slim and fairly fit, I&#x27;ll be turning 40 soon and, for the past few years, have noticed the gradual appearance of frustrating \\&quot;tree rings\\&quot; on my long, slender neck, with one actually beginning to droop some. This cream actually seems to tighten that skin a bit. The lines are still there, but at least regular use gives it a more taut appearance, which is better than doing nothing about it. I&#x27;ve always had oily skin that has made me picky about what I can wear, since many lotions and creams tend to make my skin feel smothered, greasy or dirty, but this cream is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother me much, especially considering the result. It doesn&#x27;t have a sweet, appealing fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong, chemically odor either, so I don&#x27;t mind the rather neutral smell. Besides, I usually spray on perfume or body mist after moisturizing anyway. I get migraines, but this doesn&#x27;t smell strong enough to cause them, so that&#x27;s great. Before finishing this sample size, I purchased a larger container to continue using it on a daily basis. I&#x27;ve found that using it two to three times a day renders the best result. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a cumulative effect. In other words, when I don&#x27;t use it, the lines and drooping are back as though they never went away, just FYI. :s  Still, I use it more routinely to maintain the smoothing effect. There are many other products out there that claim to tighten the neck, so many it&#x27;s overwhelming. I decided to try this one because of the availability of this sampler, better than the single- or double-use packets; because of familiarity with the name and StriVectin results onstretch marks and scars; and, finally, because even in full-sized tubs, it&#x27;s more affordable than others I&#x27;ve never even sampled to know if they&#x27;re worth it. I&#x27;d love to know of better, more effective products, so please let me know about them by replying to this review. Thank you and hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try a small size before investing in the full size.  I have a very hard time finding a neck cream that isn&#x27;t sticky.  Just received, and I tried it and I did really like it.  Did not feel sticky at all.  I cannot comment on the effectiveness of it because you probably need to use this six weeks or more before you see results.  However, it was a very small size for the price, in fact in came in a box that read \\&quot;bonus free sample\\&quot; that I guess was included with another StriVectin product, at some point.  I just thought it was overpriced.</li>
    <li> I think this is a really good product. When used religiously as directed, I have seen a difference in the texture of the skin on my face and neck. This is the lowest price out there, and this is a good size for travel.</li>
    <li> I just got this, this is my second day using it, and now I have a hot red painful rash all over my neck from this cream.  :-(  Would not recommend.  Or at least patch test a tiny area for a few days before putting it all over your neck.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long (3 weeks) don&#x27;t see any change. Package was very small (0.5 fl oz), so it&#x27;s almost all used up. Not feeling terribly optimistic at this point.</li>
    <li> My husband (Mark) bought this after reading about the ingredients at the Dr. Oz site.  I used it twice a day for two months, bought a second jar, and used that as well.  Relatives who had not seen me since Christmas asked me if I had had a face lift.  You can also see a big difference in my photograph from two years ago and now.  I used to have oily skin when I was young, but now in my upper fifties my skin has been dry and tight.  The cream really helps my skin&#x27;s overall appearance.  I recommend this product for older skin.  Try the small size first to see if you notice a difference as it is not cheap.</li>
    <li> I love all of Strivectin&#x27;s products!  My skin feels great, looks healthy.  In the 5 years I&#x27;ve been using the products, I&#x27;ve been told I look 10 years + less than my current age  : )</li>
