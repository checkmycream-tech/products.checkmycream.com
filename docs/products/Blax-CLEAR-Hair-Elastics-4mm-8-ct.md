      <li>There was an issue w/ the shipping, and they handled it superbly - would definitely buy from them again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought them.</li>
      <li>They won&#x27;t go around your wrist like a normal elastic will, but I&#x27;m okay with not being able to carry them around this way for as great as they work.</li>
      <li>We used them for the first time this week, and these Blax bands really work great!</li>
      <li>used these for a long time and they are the BEST!!!!</li>
      <li>They are extremely strong and don&#x27;t lose their shape.</li>
      <li>and I wrap these three times and can get a good high ponytail that I don&#x27;t have to keep fixing.</li>
      <li>Both are strong and don&#x27;t break my fine hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true, they&#x27;re snag free.</li>
      <li>First time I every tried them and can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>
      <li>- these elastics do the job, lots of fun ways to wear your hair knowing it will hold securely.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t say they&#x27;re completely snag-free but pretty good.</li>
      <li>These are really snag free and they hold my hair all day.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth the money if you can find a way to not lose it.</li>
      <li>Have thick hair and most bands would take a good deal of hair with it when I took it out.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about these.  </li>
      <li>This elastic is useful because in that it doesn&#x27;t pull hair out when it&#x27;s removed.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>More damage than the old style.</li>
      <li>and then they slip right off.</li>
      <li>They stay right where I put them until it&#x27;s time to take remove them</li>
      <li>Hard to find but great price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>They really don&#x27;t pull or stick to your hair!  </li>
      <li>any of you used to like the old Goody bands, the ones that used to work pretty well until they changed and got thinner a couple of years ago, these Blax bands work even better than the old Goody ones did.</li>
      <li>I am sure these are fine if your hair is just that -- fine -- and thin.  </li>
      <li>The ties seem very nice so far - They have not been worn long yet, but they stretch very well and just have a more substantial feel than other clear ties I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The 4mm fit around my fine, thin hair twice easily and hold everything security in place all day.</li>
      <li>These are my new alternative, but I would like to be able to get a smaller size (circle diameter).</li>
      <li>These really work.  </li>
      <li>These are the ONLY elastics I use in my hair because they hold securely, and they DO NOT damage your hair when removing unlike rubber bands or cover elasticize bands.</li>
      <li>Really lost a lot on that trial, since I bought them in two colors.</li>
      <li>These work very well.</li>
      <li>These really don&#x27;t snag hair.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t tangle in my super thick and long hair, and overall they have been a wonderful purchase.</li>
      <li>wanted to particularly note that I purchased from bebeautiful.</li>
      <li>This product is better for a simple ponytail or ending a braid than for any other use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They last forever and never snag  my long, fragile, very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Only came with a handful of ties but they are very sturdy and stretch to work with my thick hair :) Would highly recommend these!</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, true to the claims and the other reviews,</li>
      <li>I prefer the clear ones just because they&#x27;re unobtrusive...</li>
      <li>However, the newer clear hair ones have been breaking while in my hair.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ll probably be giving them to my young nieces.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased similar hair bands but didn&#x27;t like them as much as Blax.  </li>
      <li>Also, my preference is to twist my hair into a messy bun and wrap my hair tie around it to secure it.  </li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t very stretchy, so varying hair thicknesses won&#x27;t always have an option for number of wrap-arounds that will hold the hair properly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve reused the same one a few times and they keep their shape for the most part.  </li>
      <li>The tiny little bands have huge stretch and strength.</li>
      <li>I would recommend the 4mm to people with thick strong hair over the 2mm.</li>
      <li>They are a little stiff but it was easy to wrap the band around her ponytail twice, and the band really did just slide off her hair when she pulled it off.</li>
      <li>I have a 7-y-o with thick fine hair, which has to be pulled back for sports.</li>
      <li>and these are so tiny in circumference that I can barely get one around my ponytail once, let alone twice.  </li>
      <li>These ties are a little large, but seem to be holding up well.  </li>
      <li>They really stretch (without stretching out of shape) and are extremely durable, one pack goes a long way since one lasts through numerous uses.</li>

<li> A little tight but once used , they were easier to stretch!</li>
<li> I have very thick long hair</li>
<li> Thinking we did something wrong, we tried it again with same results, so instead of breading her hair, I just cut it out and threw the rest of them away.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these!  I have thick hair and the regular black stretchy elastics give me a headache and put a crease in my hair.  The other cheaper rubber elastics break in my hair.  These can be used over and over without breaking and don&#x27;t tangle or snag.</li>
    <li> LOVE these! They are extremely strong and don&#x27;t lose their shape. They don&#x27;t tangle in my super thick and long hair, and overall they have been a wonderful purchase.</li>
    <li> Have thick hair and most bands would take a good deal of hair with it when I took it out. So these promised to hold the hair and no breaking. NOT SO. More damage than the old style. But the shock of it is they are very thin rubber bands. Not worth the price and did not do the job. Tried them on my granddaughter who has very long baby fine but thick hair, worse job on her. Thinking we did something wrong, we tried it again with same results, so instead of breading her hair, I just cut it out and threw the rest of them away.  Really lost a lot on that trial, since I bought them in two colors. My hair color and my granddaughters.</li>
    <li> Looked at tons of products and compared reviews before I finally ordered these. Only came with a handful of ties but they are very sturdy and stretch to work with my thick hair :) Would highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> They were awesome in my curly hair! No snagging or pulling.</li>
    <li> These ties are a little large, but seem to be holding up well.  Since Goody cheapened their hair ties, which I used for years, they are completely worthless and not worth the life of a soulless corporate MBA scumbag, which isn&#x27;t worth much.  These are my new alternative, but I would like to be able to get a smaller size (circle diameter).</li>

    <li> Never pulls your hair and stays put.  I&#x27;ve reused the same one a few times and they keep their shape for the most part.  I&#x27;ve purchased similar hair bands but didn&#x27;t like them as much as Blax.  Hard to find but great price on Amazon.</li>

    <li> This elastic is useful because in that it doesn&#x27;t pull hair out when it&#x27;s removed. Some other ones I&#x27;ve used break the hair.</li>
    <li> Love these! First time I every tried them and can&#x27;t wait to get more. Don&#x27;t tear hair at all and mine is very fine so couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Simply wonderful.  They do not break, pull out hair or slowly stretch thus allowing your hair to slowly droop out of its style.</li>
    <li> These are the best hair ties. They last a long time and hold my thick hair up. Everything arrived on time.</li>
    <li> These really work.  I wish they were stretchier, but they do NOT pull my hair when I take them out.  Expensive for hair ties but I am happy.</li>
    <li> Quick ship great price very pleased with purchase and seller.</li>
    <li> A little tight but once used , they were easier to stretch!</li>
    <li> This review is for the 4mm elastics only - I haven&#x27;t tried the 2 mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I  used  a similar product by Sephora but those were discontinued.  I tried others from Sally&#x27;s, Scunci, Goody, etc. but they all tended to break or I&#x27;d see some hair on them when I took them off.  These are the very best of all I&#x27;ve tried.  They last forever and never snag  my long, fragile, very fine hair.  They stay right where I put them until it&#x27;s time to take remove them and then they slip right off.</li>
    <li> The best hair tie I have tried!! Had to buy an extra set for my purse!  I am still wearing the same hair tie (3rd week in a row!) on my thick straight hair.  It is still going strong!</li>
    <li> These work very well. I won&#x27;t say they&#x27;re completely snag-free but pretty good.</li>
    <li> These are awesome accessories and invisible in the hair!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, and these look small, and like they would break for me, but the don&#x27;t.  The expand well, and last a long time.  They are the only elastics I use!</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Won&#x27;t break even with long hair.Great for holding my ponytail in place with no slippage.It can definitely be used over and over!</li>
    <li> i love these. have used them for over 15 years.  i have really long hair. the bands stay on and in place. doesn&#x27;t grab or hurt my hair when i take them off. thank you blax!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true, they&#x27;re snag free. The tiny little bands have huge stretch and strength. I&#x27;m glad I bought them. The 4mm fit around my fine, thin hair twice easily and hold everything security in place all day. I would recommend the 4mm to people with thick strong hair over the 2mm.</li>
    <li> THE BEST! I can&#x27;t sing their praises enough. I think I bought 10 packs!</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money if you can find a way to not lose it. I&#x27;ve been using just 1 for a month and it hasn&#x27;t stretched out. It&#x27;s wide enough so you don&#x27;t lose it.</li>
    <li> I have a 7-y-o with thick fine hair, which has to be pulled back for sports. We used them for the first time this week, and these Blax bands really work great! What a relief. They are a little stiff but it was easy to wrap the band around her ponytail twice, and the band really did just slide off her hair when she pulled it off. No more hair drama! Thank you, Blax bands!! The band kept its shape even after being removed, which is great, so it can be reused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of you used to like the old Goody bands, the ones that used to work pretty well until they changed and got thinner a couple of years ago, these Blax bands work even better than the old Goody ones did.</li>
    <li> What can I say? I&#x27;ve tried all types of snag-free hair ties, and none even compare to Blax. I prefer the clear ones just because they&#x27;re unobtrusive...</li>
    <li> These are the ONLY elastics I use in my hair because they hold securely, and they DO NOT damage your hair when removing unlike rubber bands or cover elasticize bands. I&#x27;m very active and these elastics hold in place through all my rigorous athletics. They really stretch (without stretching out of shape) and are extremely durable, one pack goes a long way since one lasts through numerous uses. I have waist length wavy hair, medium thickness  - these elastics do the job, lots of fun ways to wear your hair knowing it will hold securely. Better for your hair and they work!</li>
    <li> I bought both 2 and 4 mm bands. Both are strong and don&#x27;t break my fine hair. They may slide out easier than the other bands, but that makes them less likely to break my hair also. They didn&#x27;t slide off until I pulled them off.</li>
    <li> Sorry.  I disagree. Although Goody brand has gone down hill, these are not a better alternative.</li>
    <li> love these! I used to use the goody the ones. However, the newer clear hair ones have been breaking while in my hair. So glad I found these on Amazon. These can be re-used many times and I haven&#x27;t had one break in my hair yet.</li>
    <li> Works well. Doesn&#x27;t slip .</li>
    <li> These are really snag free and they hold my hair all day.  Love them!</li>
    <li> Not crazy about these.  They aren&#x27;t very stretchy, so varying hair thicknesses won&#x27;t always have an option for number of wrap-arounds that will hold the hair properly.  What they do have going for them is that they&#x27;re as unobtrusive as you&#x27;d think.</li>
    <li> I am sure these are fine if your hair is just that -- fine -- and thin.  I have thick, wavy hair and these are so tiny in circumference that I can barely get one around my ponytail once, let alone twice.  Also, my preference is to twist my hair into a messy bun and wrap my hair tie around it to secure it.  This product is better for a simple ponytail or ending a braid than for any other use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, true to the claims and the other reviews, the texture and grip of these elastics is magical.  They really don&#x27;t pull or stick to your hair!  But I&#x27;ll probably be giving them to my young nieces.</li>
