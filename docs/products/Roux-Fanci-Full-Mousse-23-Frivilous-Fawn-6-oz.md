<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Roux fanci ful mousse did everything it claimed to do. Am very happy with it and will continue using it. Don&#x27;t have to dye my hair anymore. This product keeps my hair healthier without harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the texture and It doesn&#x27;t do much for the color</li>
    <li> Am familiar with this product.  That&#x27;s why I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I like it because is really tones down the gray hair and really blends with my natural hair color. It&#x27;s easy to use just like regular mousse, it also gives the hair body which I really like.  My hairdresser suggested I try this product because her mother uses and really likes it; so I decided to give it a try.  I would also recommend it to others to at least give it a try.</li>
    <li> The color is darker than it appears in the pic and on the can. It doesn&#x27;t cover gray very well.</li>
    <li> This easy to use mousse is hard to find in stores.  It&#x27;s great for adding a little temporary color to grey or white hair and it washes right out.  Just apply like regular mousse and then wash your hands:  it does not stain and you won&#x27;t have brown fingernails. No rubber gloves needed.  The \\&quot;Frivilous\\&quot; (sic) Fawn is a light blondish color that will just help tone down anyone&#x27;s bright whiteness. I can&#x27;t vouch for the other colors, but don&#x27;t imagine this simple product can take the place of hair dye if you are looking for a major change.</li>
    <li> This product doubles as color and mousse. I have used it for two years now and depend upon it to boost the color in my hair plus give my hair lots of body. Using rubber gloves, I rub it all over my hair, then bending over, I dry my hair with a blow dryer. I get lots of compliments on my hair since I began using this product.</li>
    <li> The product was as described and at a lower price than I had paid at the salon where I have my hair done - received it the following day</li>
    <li> The product is runny and doesn&#x27;t provide the coverage I thought it would. It actually dripped from my head minutes after I applied it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the regular (non-mousse) version, which one would expect would drip more than the mousse, but doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The mousse comes out of the can very nicely and cleanly. It&#x27;s extremely easy to apply. The color stains your hands so make sure to wear gloves. However, I haven&#x27;t had any change in my hair color. I have light brown hair so I was expecting at least some highlights or shine, but I got nothing... Disappointed, but I&#x27;ll try their lightest shade before giving up on this brand.</li>
    <li> I like this product!  The color is very subtle and the mousse adds body to my baby fine hair.  It is much easier to use than the Fanciful liquid version.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is an old fashion product, that continues to work.  It is becoming more difficult to find as time moves along.  It is perfect for those who travel frequently.  It fills the need for that color job until one returns home.  I highly recommend it and will continue to use it as long as I can find the item.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and true to its color.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use, does the job. I used this for between coloring and it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Buy the liquid form instead. This is less messy but not shiny, looks like opaque hair.</li>
    <li> I use this every day.  I love it.</li>
    <li> used it for years and love it -works fine</li>

    <li> My wife buys this stuff to keep being beautiful, I guess it works I&#x27;m still interested with her.  She&#x27;s a beauty.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this and I&#x27;m glad she did! It&#x27;s a great treatment for in between colorings.&lt;br /&gt;It even extends the time between them. The look is natural. I couldn&#x27;t be more please.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional and have used this for years. It is also very difficult to find in Retail stores. Even my beauty supply source doesn&#x27;t carry it. This product is good for touching up between color appointments or to add color to already dull hair. Love love love this product and glad Amazon and partners carry it in all its colors. About average price. I avoid shipping on this by picking up prime. Average price is around $10-$12.</li>
    <li> I have problem hair, and don&#x27;t seem to be able to do two processes--perm and color.  Lately, I was disappointed in the liquid form FANCI FULL, because it was messy drippy and the color seemed watered down.  The mousse has a nice consistency and the color is better.

Since it is  good color match I often use it at the part and temples and it gets me a little more time between coloring.  I like the body it gives my fine hair also.&lt;br /&gt;. I can find it in beauty supply stores  but recently moved so decided to order it and disappointed in the the almost 20 days for delivery for Prime. I think there might be an air issue for the can but really this long?</li>
    <li> This product is great when it&#x27;s a week or two to your next color appointment.  Rub it onto the roots after shampooing.  It will stay until next shampoo washes it out.  Good foamy consistency doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
    <li> good coverage. good as a hair gel too. vrery natural lookin</li>
    <li> The Greatest for a quick touch-up!</li>
    <li> This stuff gets me through that horrible stage when I need to get my color retouched and I still have a week or two before my appointment.  Love the stuff.</li>
