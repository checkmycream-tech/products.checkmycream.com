### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>very happy with my purchase!!</li>
      <li>Work great then after a couple months stopped.</li>
      <li>Great callous tool.</li>
      <li>Works perfect, easy to handle!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good, but as an Epilator… nahhh</li>
      <li>They need better quality control!</li>
      <li>Ordered this for my mother at Christmas and none of us were able to get it to work.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased when I first purchased it.</li>
      <li>Comparing it to my other ones I feel like it works wonderfully</li>
      <li>JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR  WOULD  ORDER, JUST BUY IT AND ENJOY</li>
      <li>The shaver is quiet and works great.</li>
      <li>and they right away mailed me a new callus remover head free of charge!!</li>
      <li>After first use the callus remover head did not work for some reason.</li>
      <li>but 2minutes ago is the first time I have tried the callus remover.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reasonable for the money.</li>
      <li>But it charges relatively fast.</li>
      <li>very useful for the &amp;#34;women&amp;#34; issues especially hair on face.</li>
      <li>I really appreciate their efficient and professional customer service!!</li>
      <li>Product hurts the first sensitive area usage.  </li>
      <li>Not bad at all on legs and other limbs.  </li>
      <li>Is a little painfull use it but is great, you dont have thick hairs anymore.</li>
      <li>I contacted the Pursonic company directly</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY and read the reviews.</li>
      <li>love it not good for shaving your hoo haa</li>
      <li>Requires several pass through the area to remove the unwanted hair, causing unexpected pain, which is eased with application of ice in the sore area.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it is worth re-ordering &amp; risk having to send back a 2nd time.</li>

    <li> I used it once and then I tried to charge it but it does not work anymore. It does not charge or it is damaged. Reading the reviews, other people have had the same problem. It must be POOR QUALITY because it should work longer. I have other epilator system since 4 years and it sill works.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY and read the reviews.</li>
    <li> Requires several pass through the area to remove the unwanted hair, causing unexpected pain, which is eased with application of ice in the sore area.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from another website. After first use the callus remover head did not work for some reason. However, the epilator and trimmer were still working. I tried looking all over the internet for some reviews and comments which would help me troubleshoot the problem so I landed on Amazon. I couldn&#x27;t find any solution so  I contacted the Pursonic company directly and they right away mailed me a new callus remover head free of charge!! I really appreciate their efficient and professional customer service!!</li>
    <li> just received, tested it out and sadly, doesn&#x27;t work right out of the box. Am sending it back as soon as I can find where to print out the label. We aren&#x27;t given the option of replacing it, only of getting a refund. Not sure if it is worth re-ordering &amp; risk having to send back a 2nd time.</li>
    <li> As a Pedicure Callus Remover and Body Shaver it&#x27;s good, but as an Epilator… nahhh</li>
    <li> I was very pleased when I first purchased it. Comparing it to my other ones I feel like it works wonderfully but it didn&#x27;t last even a month which is a bummer.</li>
    <li> very useful for the &amp;#34;women&amp;#34; issues especially hair on face. love it not good for shaving your hoo haa</li>
    <li> Extention for epilation wasn&#x27;t working at all. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, easy to handle! very happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR  WOULD  ORDER, JUST BUY IT AND ENJOY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this a while but 2minutes ago is the first time I have tried the callus remover. It is a waste of my hard earned cash.  The head does not stay on as a matter of fact it can not click into place. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR CASH BUY SOMETHING ELSE!</li>
    <li> Was not impressed by the Callus remover part. I haven&#x27;t used the razor but the Epilator works great for those nasty chin hairs.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work properly.&lt;br /&gt;The epilator doesn&#x27;t remove hair unless hair is very coarse and the foot file just makes a lot of noise without doing anything. Total waste</li>
    <li> More cutting hairs then pulling them out. to late to return</li>
    <li> Since the day I bought it, this device doesn&#x27;t get charged at all. It is really not worthy.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;i purchased this on September 11th and on October 28th it stopped working. Not sure if the battery inside just doesn&#x27;t work anymore or what but the heads won&#x27;t turn. The motor is probably dead because it takes so long to epilate your legs because there just aren&#x27;t enough heads on the item. I would only recommend this if you like to waste your money and time.&lt;br /&gt;the last epilator I purchased lasted 4plus years - this one is a WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this, I HATE shaving. Depilating hurts, but is more annoying than a real pain. Only real complaint is the battery dies rather fast. After depilating, I use the razor to get the hair that wasn&#x27;t caught by the depilator, and it dies as soon as I am done. But it charges relatively fast.</li>
    <li> Is a little painfull use it but is great, you dont have thick hairs anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m afraid I have to add to the bad reviews. Ordered this for my mother at Christmas and none of us were able to get it to work. They need better quality control!</li>
    <li> Work great then after a couple months stopped. Working don&#x27;t waste ur money get something else.</li>
    <li> Product hurts the first sensitive area usage.  Not bad at all on legs and other limbs.  Great callous tool. The shaver is quiet and works great.</li>
    <li> it dont remove anything !!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s reasonable for the money.</li>
