      <li>Works perfectly...</li>
      <li>Great Pomade!!</li>
      <li>Let me tell you why this is the perfect pomade.  </li>

      <li>So happy!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect.</li>

      <li>Awesome product and service!</li>
      <li>wish i tried this before i went all-out with superior!</li>
      <li>If you want to get started on pomades, or if you want to try something that doesn&#x27;t tear your hair out like Murray&#x27;s Superior, this is the stuff!</li>
      <li>- If you&#x27;ve ever tried Murray&#x27;s Superior, you know that stuff has to be warmed up with a blow dryer during application and removed with a blow torch while cleaning!</li>
      <li>This stuff is perfect for that, unlike the superior murray&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>smells great as well and for the price, it is my go to pomade</li>
      <li>I comb and comb until my hair looks great</li>

      <li>Great product for those that don&#x27;t like the weight and feel of product in your hair.</li>
      <li>this isn&#x27;t water soluble, but your hair will look great.</li>
      <li>Smells great, washes out with shampoo.</li>

      <li>Great hold, stays flexible and a great shine.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have that great of a hold, and the grease is a pain to get out of your hair.</li>
      <li>Great on my hair.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice pomade.</li>
      <li>I thought murrays pomade was very good and very light</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used a product that smelled so good.</li>
      <li>all in all good buy</li>
      <li>good price.</li>
      <li>life is good</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Created in 1929 using great ingredients like lanolin (wool wax from sheep), Aloe and Coconut Oil, this pomade will leave your hair smelling subtely sweet for days - even if you don&#x27;t wash it!  </li>
      <li>got some of this.. and it works amazing</li>
      <li>Got a nice shine finish.</li>
      <li>so it was effective in styling but not too sticky.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair kind of greasy, but that is just the nature of these sort of products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just not as effective as I had hoped it would be.  </li>
      <li>Works great, great shine, shapes just as gel, smells fine, cool looking jar.  </li>
      <li>very nice hold and light shine.</li>
      <li>I must recommend Murray&#x27;s Super Light Pomade for the excellent control and manageablity</li>
      <li>It goes in very easily, and washed out with out a problem.</li>
      <li>It also makes my hair feel soft and it looks great!</li>
      <li>Once again, the old product is the best.</li>
      <li>Its a medium shine so your hair looks healthy and it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Petrolatum based pomades or hair dressings are most effective for my needs.</li>
      <li>I bought this pomade for my brother--who recently got a &amp;#34;comb over&amp;#34;--after reading on a website that this is a popular, tried-and-true pomade, and the price is great!</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve used axe sleek shine, axe clean cut, and murray&#x27;s superior pomades.</li>
      <li>This product has a great aroma, and when I first used it, it worked well at controlling my hair.  </li>
      <li>Supper Light holds better than any of the AXE products, and is more manageable than Murray&#x27;s Superior.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love the feel of this in my hair.</li>
      <li>love this stuff</li>
      <li>And it works much better than the AXE hair pastes.</li>
      <li>My favorite part has to be the smell though.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite pomades.</li>
      <li>MLP&amp;HD is likely the best bang for the buck</li>
      <li>Cheap and effective.</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s &amp;#34;super light&amp;#34; I see it as more of a light-medium hold so</li>
      <li>It works ok.  </li>
      <li>I bought 6 more cans.</li>
      <li>it has good shine and good enough hold.</li>
      <li>Murray&#x27;s Supper Light is great if you&#x27;re looking to get that classic look.</li>
      <li>hair&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;- Great hold, but keeps the hair soft and pliable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It absorbs well into the hair, makes it manageable, soft, pleasant to the touch, full looking and has a nice but not overpowering fruity aroma.</li>
      <li>The Hold - solutions like Brylcreem may be great for that light, wet look while Murray&#x27;s Superior may be fine for the \\&quot;patent leather\\&quot; finish of the &#x27;20&#x27;s</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Easy to comb through hair.</li>
      <li>Easy to get out while shampooing in the shower.</li>
      <li>This stuff washes off your hands easy and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>it is great for getting a nice shine to your hair but not much else.</li>
      <li>I heard about murrays on some forums and wanted to try the light pomade for easy wash-out and medium hold.</li>
      <li>I love the super light and I recommend it to anyone looking for a medium strength pomade that is easy on anyones pockets.</li>
      <li>you do not get a huge gob of the stuff</li>
      <li>its great if you want ti sleek back</li>
      <li>I have thinning hair and want to enjoy it while still having some.</li>
      <li>it smells better than murray&#x27;s superior, is easier to work into your hair (you have to stick superior in the OVEN just to make it soft enough), and easier to work out of your hair.</li>
      <li>because i sometimes use vaseline in my hair; it&#x27;s scentless, light, and inexpensive.    </li>
      <li>I wash my hair daily and while some of the stuff remains in it serves as a great pre-shampoo hair conditioner.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair looking smooth and somewhat shiny if it is combed</li>
      <li>(why not use something rust free guys), and it seems to offset the control of hair spray, so not recommended for windy days</li>
      <li>Not as light and greasy as Royal Crown or as waxy as a number of others</li>
      <li>With Murray&#x27;s light pomade, you can/should carry around a comb with you.</li>
      <li>The product is fantastic and at the price....</li>
      <li>The benefit to this hold is that your hair will stay put all day, unlike Brylcreem or Vitalis, while still being soft and pliable, unlike Murray&#x27;s Superior.  </li>
      <li>An excellent price here - I&#x27;m still getting used to the product but it is exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I was able to find it on amazon for pretty cheap depending on the seller.</li>
      <li>This is my first pomade, and i&#x27;m so satisfied.</li>
      <li>I prefer the original Murrays Pomade.  </li>
      <li>Value-wise, worth it!</li>
      <li>either stick w/ the original murray&#x27;s or use a jar of vaseline.</li>
      <li>I use about a quarter size, emulsify it between my hands, and lightly slick it through, does the job perfectly and takes no time at all.</li>
      <li>I keep my can in the fridge since it does tend to get real soft if it gets too warm.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great, however, I think I&#x27;ll still stick with something a little more clay based rather than pomade.  </li>
      <li>I have tried about everything to keep my hair cleanly and neatly in place.    </li>
      <li>but then i found murray&#x27;s super light.</li>
      <li>murray&#x27;s super light has not staying power.</li>
      <li>After applying a generous amount of Super Light to your clean hair, you can go without reapplication for two to three days.</li>
      <li>super light is cheap, too - i bought it at wal-mart for the same price as murray&#x27;s superior, $1.93 here in california.    </li>

    <li> One of my favorite pomades. I have thinning hair and want to enjoy it while still having some. As thinning hair is very &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; the right pomade tames it and makes it manageable and gives it a thicker appearance. I&#x27;ve acquired quite a collection of various hair preparations. I&#x27;ve learned to stay away from gels, Vitalis and cremes (I do occasionally use Groom &amp; Clean and Brylcreem). The worst products are the various Old Spice and Axe junk, which I find smell bad, are too sticky (not a waxy stickiness more like glue) and can irritate the scalp. Petrolatum based pomades or hair dressings are most effective for my needs. After trying and using a number of Dax products (Dax 100% Pure Lanolin is very nice, nicer than their green stuff), Tres Flores, Royal Crown and others, including Yardley&#x27;s Lavender Brilliantine (which I find exceptional) I currently have designated this classic hair preparation as my regular go to hair grooming product. Not as light and greasy as Royal Crown or as waxy as a number of others MLP&amp;HD has the right balance of greasy slickness and waxy stickiness. It absorbs well into the hair, makes it manageable, soft, pleasant to the touch, full looking and has a nice but not overpowering fruity aroma. MLP&amp;HD is likely the best bang for the buck but it would be worth picking up even if it was pricier. I wash my hair daily and while some of the stuff remains in it serves as a great pre-shampoo hair conditioner. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t worry if you aren&#x27;t going for a greaser pompadour, this stuff can handle any hair style.  I got tired of spending $5-$8 for the axe hair products. Someone recommended American Crew but that was overpriced and smelled strange. I heard about murrays on some forums and wanted to try the light pomade for easy wash-out and medium hold. This stuff is so cheap for a tin that will last you at least a few months. I have really thick hair and it gives that perfect amount of hold where I can still run my hand through it and not come up with grease all over my hand. Its a medium shine so your hair looks healthy and it smells amazing. I use about a quarter size, emulsify it between my hands, and lightly slick it through, does the job perfectly and takes no time at all. I love the super light and I recommend it to anyone looking for a medium strength pomade that is easy on anyones pockets.</li>
    <li> This the beat stuff Eva.  You wanna look great buy this.  I got 12 girlfriends now. Helps me get out of doing work all the time as well.</li>
    <li> I have been growing out my hair for a few months now so I could have the \\&quot;greaser\\&quot; look&lt;br /&gt;but I was having trouble getting it to stay flat back.. and look good&lt;br /&gt;I tried Gels and it did nothing for it.. got some of this.. and it works amazing&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff</li>
    <li> As a 46 yr. old white guy with thining hair I have tried about everything to keep my hair cleanly and neatly in place.    I must recommend Murray&#x27;s Super Light Pomade for the excellent control and manageablity it provides.    I have heard many complain it is difficult to wash out of hair, I have not had an issue with this perhaps because I only use a quarter sized amount and Prell Classic shampoo.    I am considering trying out Murray&#x27;s Nu Nile next for even more shine!    Go Murrays! A greatAmerican product at a great price!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used axe sleek shine, axe clean cut, and murray&#x27;s superior pomades. axe was too expensive and murray&#x27;s superior is too stinkin&#x27; hard to get out of your hair.    but then i found murray&#x27;s super light. it smells better than murray&#x27;s superior, is easier to work into your hair (you have to stick superior in the OVEN just to make it soft enough), and easier to work out of your hair. it has good shine and good enough hold. super light is cheap, too - i bought it at wal-mart for the same price as murray&#x27;s superior, $1.93 here in california.    my only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t hold up as well as superior, but heck, in the long run i guess the lower concentration of vaseline is better for your scalp. wish i tried this before i went all-out with superior!</li>
    <li> Product holds well and not like some other pomades which are like glue. Easy to get out while shampooing in the shower. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I first received this Pomade.  I have very curly, wavy, Italian hair, so it gets unruly and frizzy throughout the day.  This product has a great aroma, and when I first used it, it worked well at controlling my hair.  My biggest complaint is that its very greasy at the end of the day, and I had some trouble getting it out of my hair.</li>
    <li> Murray&#x27;s Supper Light is great if you&#x27;re looking to get that classic look. It goes in very easily, and washed out with out a problem. Supper Light holds better than any of the AXE products, and is more manageable than Murray&#x27;s Superior. And for an added plus the tin is very cool looking with a barber pole, and Classic lettering.</li>
    <li> Works great, great shine, shapes just as gel, smells fine, cool looking jar.  CONS - Jar cap rusting after 1 month, which gets messy brown stuff on you when taking off (why not use something rust free guys), and it seems to offset the control of hair spray, so not recommended for windy days</li>
    <li> I thought murrays pomade was very good and very light so it was effective in styling but not too sticky. My hair never felt \\&quot;hard\\&quot; or unmanagable.</li>
    <li> Works well and keeps my hair back. It isn&#x27;t really greasy contrary to what people think.</li>
    <li> No hold. Very shiny. Hard to wash out.</li>
    <li> i would have purchased again because it leaves no her up when enough is applied to the hair. a little expensive for the price for my likeing im a cheap pursane . ha. its great if you want ti sleek back</li>
    <li> i like it . dont use to much though if youre a guy . or your forhead will look like a mirror</li>
    <li> Works perfectly... I recommend heating the pomade with a hair dryier then applying it to the hair... You can pump up your hair misfits style... Only down side is it doesn&#x27;t smell that good...</li>
    <li> Great Pomade!! But remember, it&#x27;s oil based so if you plan on getting this out without a fight... You&#x27;re mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;This has become my everyday pomade. I switched from the Suavecito (which was water based) and it&#x27;s a pretty hefty difference. With Murray&#x27;s light pomade, you can/should carry around a comb with you. Even though it&#x27;s &amp;#34;super light&amp;#34; I see it as more of a light-medium hold so, it&#x27;s still malleable.</li>
    <li> This pomade is good only thing you the only thing is that don&#x27;t put too much it would make your hair super oily with just a lil&#x27; bit it would do the trick.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s lighter but the thing with it is that it doesn&#x27;t hold &amp;#34;as well&amp;#34; as the original murry&#x27;s but the original IS A PAIN to wash out and it&#x27;s horrible for your hair. both contain petroleum but this contains WAY LESS than the original</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance &amp; not as sticky as the standard version.</li>
    <li> this stuff is no better than vaseline. how do i know?... because i sometimes use vaseline in my hair; it&#x27;s scentless, light, and inexpensive.    murray&#x27;s super light has not staying power. either stick w/ the original murray&#x27;s or use a jar of vaseline.</li>
    <li> Cheap and effective. If you haven&#x27;t used this stuff before it&#x27;s worth the price. I use it everyday and it can last me at least 3 months. It smells a lot better than the regular Murray&#x27;s and it actually comes out of your hair after a SINGLE wash! Do you believe that?! I put mine in a small travel size screw cup and that can last for a two or three week trip.</li>
    <li> Good product. good price.</li>
    <li> An excellent price here - I&#x27;m still getting used to the product but it is exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> My hair isn&#x27;t very thick, but it&#x27;s wild and bushy, and needs something to keep it in place of it grows past 1/2 inch or so. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of things, from hair tonic to stuff sold only in salons at prices a straight man shouldn&#x27;t pay. You&#x27;ll probably find this stuff in the ethnic section of the drug store, if not you can get it right here on Amazon. It&#x27;s cheap, but rub a little between your fingers right and run it through wet hair and your hair will stay in place all day. Gives you shine and separation and definition. Murray&#x27;s is old old school and a 3 oz tin will last you for months.</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re using cheap shampoo while on vacation and just want to add a little shine to your dried out locks, just fingertip some of this thru...use sparingly! or it will take you days to wash it out. it&#x27;s very greasy and reminiscent of &amp;#34;greaser days&amp;#34; of yore (u know...like ant man shoes and &#x27;57 chevy&#x27;s...oh, wait! the movie &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34;!)</li>
    <li> Started my pomade-scapades with American Crew pomade and not only is this product better for my hair, but I could buy 5 of them for the same price.    I just wet my hair a bit, and take it in my hands and rub it until warm. Then I put it in deep, moving around until it&#x27;s hard. Then I comb. I comb and comb until my hair looks great and I&#x27;m ready for the day!</li>
    <li> Goes in easy - usually stays in for about one extra day. everything a pomade should be. will purchase again. May try the regular as well because I tend to finish off with some hair spray for extra hold.</li>
    <li> We all want to look like a 40&#x27;s movie star, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note this isn&#x27;t water soluble, but your hair will look great.</li>
    <li> it arrived in 4 days with a couple of dings on the tin itself, it is very much so like petroleum jelly with a natural smell to it although i expected it to hold much better, also it makes your hair look nice and shiny, the product also made my hair softer... I will try the superior and/or Nu Nile next! all in all good buy</li>
    <li> I like the product, it is simple and only a small amount is required for styling.  Does give a greasy appearance but that can be reduced by applying an extremely small amount.  Smells great, washes out with shampoo.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you why this is the perfect pomade.  1. The Price - you can blow however much you want on competitors junk and you still can&#x27;t touch the high quality, and high value, of Super Light at $2-$3.  2. The Hold - solutions like Brylcreem may be great for that light, wet look while Murray&#x27;s Superior may be fine for the \\&quot;patent leather\\&quot; finish of the &#x27;20&#x27;s that never goes away. After applying a generous amount of Super Light to your clean hair, you can go without reapplication for two to three days. Just wake up and comb! The benefit to this hold is that your hair will stay put all day, unlike Brylcreem or Vitalis, while still being soft and pliable, unlike Murray&#x27;s Superior.  3. The Removal - If you&#x27;ve ever tried Murray&#x27;s Superior, you know that stuff has to be warmed up with a blow dryer during application and removed with a blow torch while cleaning! Super Light is far easier to remove. Either wash your hair in the shower as usual for three or four days, or apply a generous dallop of Groom&amp;Clean for 24 hours. In either case, the natural tendency of Super Light is to leave your hair shining and healthy while also leaving your hair for good after less than a week. Even if you don&#x27;t wash your hair or use G&amp;C, you will see a marked reduction in hold and substance if you fail to reapply.  4. The Other Stuff - This is truly a vintage man&#x27;s pomade! Created in 1929 using great ingredients like lanolin (wool wax from sheep), Aloe and Coconut Oil, this pomade will leave your hair smelling subtely sweet for days - even if you don&#x27;t wash it!  If you want to get started on pomades, or if you want to try something that doesn&#x27;t tear your hair out like Murray&#x27;s Superior, this is the stuff!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel really oily without the benefit of holding it in place.</li>
    <li> I have straight fine hair and it is always blowing all over the place and looks like a mess. I used this stuff and my hair looks the best it has ever looked in my life. I wish I had known about this years ago. Smells good, does not look greasy, goes a LONG way as not a lot is needed. I keep my can in the fridge since it does tend to get real soft if it gets too warm. Using it cold means you use less since when you stick your finger tips into the can you do not get a huge gob of the stuff but just enough to do the job. Once again, the old product is the best. Happens all the time.</li>
    <li> This pomade works well and isn&#x27;t too stiff ...keeps up all day.  A decent product and is light and easily washed out in shower.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for that slick, clean look. It keeps a hold all-day and then some without feeling overly greasy or sticky like other products tend to. A little bit definitely goes a long way. It&#x27;s easier to wash off your hands than other products I&#x27;ve tried. I was able to find it on amazon for pretty cheap depending on the seller. My favorite part has to be the smell though. I&#x27;ve never used a product that smelled so good. I&#x27;m growing my hair out a bit longer so I&#x27;ve put a halt on using it for now, but even just knowing I have this sitting on my bathroom shelf makes me want to revert to a clean cut/hip look that this definitely works well for. I recommend this to all those guys out there sporting that short-on-the-sides/longer-on-top look. Overall Murray&#x27;s Super Light is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> Having gone through many new-age pomades...mostly water soluble, I decided to give this old school classic a shot.  Wow!  Not disappointed and there is a reason this has been a classic and go-to for so many people.  Great hold, stays flexible and a great shine.  The product is fantastic and at the price....one that can&#x27;t be beat. Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice pomade. I&#x27;ve been collecting different pomades, on the search for the good stuff. This pomade and Three Flowers are my favorites so far. For starters, Murray&#x27;s Super Light smells terrific. The consistency is just right, not too chunky or greasy. Getting it in the hair is a breeze. Feels light but holds tight. Great shine but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this pomade for my brother--who recently got a &amp;#34;comb over&amp;#34;--after reading on a website that this is a popular, tried-and-true pomade, and the price is great! However, he didn&#x27;t like it. The petroleum base gives the hair a different shine (too shiny) and is hard to wash out even though it&#x27;s the super light version. It&#x27;s now sitting in a corner of his closet.</li>
    <li> This is my first pomade, and i&#x27;m so satisfied. Your money could not be spent in a better way. It DOES NOT make your hair greasy, stiff, or flakey. And it works much better than the AXE hair pastes. It also makes my hair feel soft and it looks great! So happy!</li>
    <li> you cannot go wrong with this pomade. very nice hold and light shine. smells great as well and for the price, it is my go to pomade</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this over the standard Murrays product.  The standard Murrays is just too oily and greasy in my hair.  It looks wet and slimy all day.  This stuff has a great balance between hold and shine, plus it isn&#x27;t impossible to get out of your hair.  The normal Murrays took me forever to get out of my hair, I had to wash it 3-4 times just to remove it.  This stuff is much easier and works pretty well.  For the price it&#x27;s great, however, I think I&#x27;ll still stick with something a little more clay based rather than pomade.  If you&#x27;re after the pomade, slicked back look however, this is the stuff for you.</li>
    <li> For $3 you simply can&#x27;t beat the value of Murray&#x27;s. I use this product nearly every day and this 3 oz tin has lasted me nearly 3 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Value. You can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;- Super Light is much lighter and thinner than Murray&#x27;s original pomade. This product was made for &#x27;white people hair&#x27; whereas the original pomade was made for &#x27;black people hair&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;- Great hold, but keeps the hair soft and pliable.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to comb through hair. Much Easier to wash out than Original Murray&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Smell is nothing to complain about. You can&#x27;t smell it while it is on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves hair looking smooth and somewhat shiny if it is combed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves hair kind of greasy, but that is just the nature of these sort of products. The girlfriend probably wont want to run her fingers through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;- If you get it wet, the tin will begin to develop rust spots after about 2 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR It&#x27;s great and I would certainly purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like the light better than the thick version of this product.  This dressing doesn&#x27;t build up fast on the hair.  It is okay for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This pomade is incredibly easy to work with if you&#x27;re using either wet or dry hair, blow drier or none. It can produce the sheen look if you&#x27;re slicking your hair back or to the side, or a more natural look if you&#x27;re going for volume. More so than many other pomades, it is easy to apply, clean, and get the results that you had intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback is that the hold is just not quiet as strong as I prefer it to be, as my hair tends to fight back. Given the difference in ease of use between this Murray&#x27;s superior hold pomade, and other reproduces on the market, I&#x27;m sticking with this Super Light. Can&#x27;t beat the price and results.</li>
    <li> Hoping this stuff would either be lighter or would hold hair in place.. It isn&#x27;t and it doesn&#x27;t! You could get motor oil and have the same look! Have fun washing your hair literally 5x to get it out- It&#x27;s definately going in the trash..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great pomade at a fraction of the price others are charging.</li>
    <li> This is what i&#x27;ve been looking for. A pomade that gives the shine and hold I want. I like my hair to be flexible and take my fingers running through it. This stuff is perfect for that, unlike the superior murray&#x27;s. This stuff washes off your hands easy and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do. But might be hard to wash it off as it is oil based. Value-wise, worth it!</li>
    <li> i have curly hair. when i need a haircut in the past I&#x27;ve had to put crusty stuff on my hair that makes it stiff. it works until i get rained on. then i think the crusty stuff doesn&#x27;t do so well. murray works. my hair isn&#x27;t stiff. and i smell like a coconut. life is good</li>
    <li> Awesome product and service! I bought 6 more cans.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my beard.  It works ok.  Definitely takes the frizz out of it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay in very long.  It is exactly what I thought it would be, so I am not taking any stars away.  It&#x27;s just not as effective as I had hoped it would be.  I prefer the original Murrays Pomade.  That stays longer and holds my unruly mustache down pretty well.</li>
    <li> A+++. Love the feel of this in my hair. Not too heavy, not too light. It&#x27;s perfect. Great product for those that don&#x27;t like the weight and feel of product in your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Great on my hair. Got a nice shine finish.</li>
    <li> cant believe this stuff is just $3+.  it works just as well, in not better, than the more expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> I expected this to have some hold to it it is great for getting a nice shine to your hair but not much else. Smells great though.</li>
    <li> It does what its suppose to do when it comes to styling your hair. It does not make your hair stiff or flaky. The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that its hard to get the gunk off your hair. Even after shampooing, your hair still feels sticky...</li>
    <li> Not AS bad as the original Murray&#x27;s, but still not good. Doesn&#x27;t have that great of a hold, and the grease is a pain to get out of your hair.</li>
