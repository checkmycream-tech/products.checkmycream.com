      <li>Wonderful product for fine, fragile hair.</li>
      <li>I love it because it smells great, it is not heavy at all on your hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok if you have fine hair.  </li>
      <li>if money is no object, Wen is your haircare...if you are concerned with cost and want to smell deliciously tropical, buy the huge sized Humectress Conditioner Product 44oz for the same money (but 3x the product) and also available on amazon...</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and smelling great.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin and want your hair to smell and feel great, try this one.  </li>

      <li>This really is the best shampoo for my daughter, who is 2 years old.</li>
      <li>she loves the fragrance and easy use.</li>

      <li>Nice and gentle for childrens hair.  </li>
      <li>It does make the hair smooth, but you must rinse thoroughly.  </li>
      <li>Clean smelling, easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is not tear free though.</li>
      <li>It is the same great product but without the unflattering scent.</li>
      <li>and it is silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>The smell of it is great, but it is entirely different than the almond mint.</li>
      <li>wen is great and this is the only line (the kids) that doesn&#x27;t smell like menthol...</li>
      <li>Have been using the regular kind, but couldn&#x27;t find a sent that I liked.</li>

      <li>I have a perm, and it works great as long as I rinse very well.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying for things if its worth paying for and</li>

      <li>and wow, love the smell.</li>

      <li>Works great on my little 3 yr olds hair and mine too!</li>
      <li>The kids don&#x27;t seem to care (4 year old and 4 month old), but we certainly love it!</li>
      <li>my daughter has very fine blonde hair.  </li>
      <li>I can comb my hair and let it dry on its own</li>
      <li>however it is really not necessary to use daily (nor pleasant).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well on my 3 year old niece&#x27;s very hard to manage hair. Her hair gets very knotted and matted... It makes it soft but not oily... The apple smell is  amazing ... I recommend it</li>
    <li> I personally love this shampoo.  Have been using the regular kind, but couldn&#x27;t find a sent that I liked. I stumbled upon this and wow, love the smell. Seems to do the same as the regular shampoo. Might not have as much of a shine as the regular one but does a great job taming the frizz. I think they should make this sent for adults.</li>
    <li> Nice and gentle for childrens hair.  Clean smelling, easy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok if you have fine hair.  My son has thick, dry, curly hair and it moisturized but I think he needed more moisture.</li>
    <li> It smells great. I&#x27;m allergic to the regular WEN. This takes care of that. Leaves my hair soft and smelling great.</li>
    <li> My sons love this fragrance. I use Wen and I love that I can use on him. works great and smells great</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for fine, fragile hair.</li>
    <li> Works great on my grand-daughters curl hair.</li>
    <li> wen is great and this is the only line (the kids) that doesn&#x27;t smell like menthol...if money is no object, Wen is your haircare...if you are concerned with cost and want to smell deliciously tropical, buy the huge sized Humectress Conditioner Product 44oz for the same money (but 3x the product) and also available on amazon... The company Nexxus that makes Humectress has been around for along time and if you stop using shampoo&#x27;s altogether you can use nearly any conditioner as a &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34;.  Humectress, in particular though, has equalled or surpassed the Wen for me. If your hair is severely damaged by coloring etc...I would recommend getting one of the traditional WEN product line like the smelly fig or any of the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; formula&#x27;s...whatever the menthol like item is in their product will zapp your hair back to better than original life...however it is really not necessary to use daily (nor pleasant). I keep Wen on hand for bi-weekly treatment and the variety does make your hair happy....I enjoyed this apple Wen, but it does not yield the results of the offensively smelling adult line...so ill stick with my above routine...i hope this is helpfull, as it was years of experimenting before i was always asked what i used... my hair does look that good now...</li>
    <li> I received this product in the mail today and I am a happy camper...I purchased the Lavender but had issues with the menthol....I could not smell the lavender just the menthol and I did not care for the smell was sensitive to it, however my hair looked very nice after use, I just had to keep the rinse cycle going longer than usual....I have baby fine hair and the apple kids formula was a good choice for me, no tangles, shiny beautiful hair its a winner, thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this cleansing conditioner - fast shipping.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This product conditions my DD&#x27;s hair - helps to control the frizz.  BUT I don&#x27;t feel like it cleans at all.  After 3-4 uses her hair starts to appear greasy and weighted down.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great choice and scent.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick hair this is perfect, she loves how she can comb right through her hair after it is washed</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it works great like the rest of the wen hair cleansers.  Best one so far.</li>
    <li> This really is the best shampoo for my daughter, who is 2 years old. She is in the pool every week and twirls her hair at night to fall asleep, so her hair is a complete mess. This is the only shampoo/conditioner that makes her hair smooth and even improves her hair to make it stronger, softer and resist her constant hair twirling! I love it.</li>
    <li> The smell of it is great, but it is entirely different than the almond mint. This made my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I love it because it smells great, it is not heavy at all on your hair.  I also have a very sensitive scalp and am not able to use the other cleansing conditioners because they make my head itch.  If you have sensitive skin and want your hair to smell and feel great, try this one.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my 2yr old granddaughter, now she looks like a baby when she wakes up</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have very thick, naturally curly hair and both battle frizz and the inability to control our hair.  Wen is like magic.  Our hair is under control, has more shine, we use less products.  Wen has made our hair softer.  I can comb my hair and let it dry on its own and it looks great or I can blow dry and straighten my hair and it is silky smooth.  We love the green apple scent too!  Wen has also cured my scalp of the nagging itch I used to have constantly from dry scalp.  The Wen for kids doesn&#x27;t seem to build up on my hair like the adult version Wen, but I do like the Pomegranate Wen as well.  We use about 3 pumps of the product on our shoulder length hair and it works great.  The directions say 10 and that is just a waste as far as I&#x27;m concerned....way too much.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses the apple scent and her hair smells great, and her hair us nice and thick and healthy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter when I purchased the Pomegranate Wen for myself.  While my experience with Wen was, shall we say, less than satisfactory, this stuff works beautifully on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It also smells super-yummy.</li>
    <li> Not only does the product cost a lot but in order to use as directed you need to use a ton of the product.  Hair really did feel great after and made brushing an ease!  Noticed lots of split ends after about a month of use.  I can&#x27;t guarantee it was caused by Wen but it only seemed to occur after using this product.</li>
    <li> Really loved it! Was better than I expected. Leaves my daughters hair with no tangles, and a beautiful shine!</li>
    <li> My son is 2 years old and has very curly hair. I was using Johnson&#x27;s shampoo which cleaned his hair but after about an hour his hair felt dry and became very frizzy. After using this product, I no longer have to wash his hair every day. His hair stays curly and soft the entire day. I do not have to use conditioner or add any additional products for his curls. Also, I don&#x27;t have to detangle his hair anymore. I can simply comb his hair with the shampoo using my fingers. The product is expensive, but I only have to use one or two pumps at most on his hair, so it does last a long time. I normally buy the WEN Kids Cleansing Conditioner on QVC and was worried that this product would not be the same formula. I don&#x27;t seem to see a difference with my son&#x27;s hair, so I will continue buying the WEN Kids Cleansing Conditioner here.</li>
    <li> Works great on my little 3 yr olds hair and mine too! I will never go back to regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. She&#x27;s 4. It smells good-not too strong of a smell. It is not tear free though. I would buy again anyway.</li>
    <li> My son says...it smells good.  He switched from johnson &amp; johnson baby shampoo to wen.  And it makes his hair shinier and smoother.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! The only downfall is the price is high for how much you use at a time. Only lasts my daughter 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> The product is very thick. Be sure to have SOAKING wet hair before application.  It leaves hair feeling very soft and alive.  I have a perm, and it works great as long as I rinse very well.  The fragrance is awesome, and my 3 year old granddaughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Wen hair cleansing products!  I wanted my friend to try it for her daughters&#x27; hair, so I ordered it for her.  She enjoys these products as well.  The product came on time but the box the conditioner came in was crushed, so the packaging could have been better.  Other than that, I love all Chaz Dean&#x27;s products!</li>
    <li> Jury is still out on this one.  I had purchased the regular (not kids&#x27; version) of a different scent and I had a reaction.  This one did not cause a reaction.  It does make the hair smooth, but you must rinse thoroughly.  I haven&#x27;t used it long term.  The directions say you have to use 10-20 pumps of the product, which seems like way too much, especially for a child.  If you can handle &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; your hair with conditioner, it&#x27;s OK.  Nice scent.  This seems to be a popular line, but I don&#x27;t get the hype.  Might work for you.</li>
    <li> Some days my hair comes out ok but not great and others it is to oily from using this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE this for the grandbabbies.</li>
    <li> I use this on my 4 year old daughter, she has long hair past her waist. Makes her hair silky smooth and smell delicious!</li>
    <li> Love the smell best shampoo ever</li>
    <li> Well, another disappointment for me by Wen :(  I wanted to be a Wen girl so badly.  I tried almost every &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; of Wen throughout the years.  Each time, after a few uses, my scalp would break out so badly.  I would develop dandruff, etc.  Chaz Dean himself recommened this to me (via Facebook).  I mentioned my gluten allergies and he suggested trying this.  Well, unfortunately it did the same thing - the scalp breaking out, etc.  I truly wish my body would enjoy these products so I could have beautiful Wen girl hair - but alas, it will not.  Sorry Chaz.</li>
    <li> I got this for my teenage daughter who has fine long hair and a ton of it. Nothing has ever really worked like they say without leaving a residue or weight. This Apple Wen is perfect. my daughter started off using my Sweet almond mint and when I got her Apple for kids she was not happy thinking it would not be like the other. She was glad that was disproved and loves the smell. Yes Wen is expensive but I added up how much salon shampoo conditioner and detangler I was buying every month and it is actually a little cheaper using Wen. She follows the instructions and her hair is never greasy or weighed down. She can run her comb through it and is no longer wanting to chop her hair off because nothing else has worked. Thank you Mr. Chaz for making this awesome product. I just wish you could figure out a way to use the pump until bottle is empty because you have to take off pump and bang it out to get the rest at bottom out(and it still has quite a bit).</li>
    <li> Love this for my granddaughters thick and very curly hair. Her mom was always putting it up because you really could not do anything with it because it is so thick and curly. Since using the WEN for kids. We are able to leave her hair down and it be under control.</li>
    <li> Really like the Wen products and the Apple is my favorite and I can use it on my granddaughters hair without allergy worries</li>
    <li> I love WEN products. This kid&#x27;s product cleans/conditions as well as the adult line. I no longer need to use a second, chemical heavy product to remove tangles after my daughter sleeps on her washed hair.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t sting her eyes but my 2 yr. old didn&#x27;t complain when I was using adult WEN to wash her hair.  I gave this product only 3 stars because its smell is very chemical in spite  of being a very natural cleanser. I won&#x27;t purchase this kid&#x27;s WEN again but I will continue to buy the adult version as my toddler&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
    <li> grandbaby loves it and I love it.</li>
    <li> I like the way Wen makes my course and unruly hair feel.  It nourishes and cleanses without the drying effects of regular shampoo.  I loved the product but did not care for the menthol scent.  I would often go back to regular shampoo just to make my hair smell good. This Wen children&#x27;s shampoo does smell like fresh green apples.  It is the same great product but without the unflattering scent. I read another review stating a similar opinion.  This is the reason I decided to try it.  I am glad I did.  I am truly back to being a Wen girl!</li>
    <li> Miy Granddaughter is only 5 years old, but she has unusually thick long hair for her age.  Her hairdresser was shocked to see how this cleaning conditioner managed her hair and softened the texture, with the first time usesage.</li>
    <li> my daughter has very fine blonde hair.  theres a lot of damage from ponytails and blow drying so her hair was dull and just breaking off and wasn&#x27;t growing.  I decided to try this product and it has made all the difference.  her hair shines!  her hair has grown! I don&#x27;t mind paying for things if its worth paying for and this product is.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. My daughter has the most dry, frizzy, curly, unmanageable hair imaginable. She loves the scent and it helps to soften her hair. Love Wen. Pricey but good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic.  No tangles, soft hair, smells great (apple).  We put it on at the top of bathtime and rinse it off at the end.  The kids don&#x27;t seem to care (4 year old and 4 month old), but we certainly love it!</li>
    <li> It is hard to believe with the amount of Wen Cleansing Conditioners available there could be so much difference between them. The Kids Apple is so far my favorite. Love the texture, which is slightly thicker and very emollient and leaves my fine hair with a silky lightweight feel. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, and the smell is fresh and not coying like some of the scents. Also, if you are like me and not a fan of menthol (which is in the Lavender and the Aloe, that I have experienced) the Kids Apple doesn&#x27;t seem to have any, or not as much as the others. My scalp doesn&#x27;t feel like an iceberg after my shampoo.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter she loves the fragrance and easy use.</li>
    <li> My daughters LOVE this conditioner.  They have informed me that they need the watermelon flavor(scent) as well.</li>
    <li> Love it!! My daughter&#x27;s hair is curly and she used to cry when I had to comb through it but with this great product no more crying and her hair looks beautiful!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Kids appreciate not having to shampoo and condition, and their hair smells delicious.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been solely using Wen for almost a year. I was having scalp reactions to the menthol in the adult scents. I read a review of another adult having the same issue but started using Wen for kids (no menthol!)  I&#x27;m sold!!! It smells great and still has all the amazing benefits!! I found this seller (not Prime) but with fast, FREE SHIPPING-BONUS! I&#x27;m a happy Momma!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this shampoo. Smells great! Fast shipment from Seller.</li>
    <li> like this hair product leaves the hair soft and shiny love it</li>
    <li> great product.  hair smells delicious and makes the hair fuller and easier to comb through.</li>
    <li> It smells divine! Her hair is clean and soft when we are finished and I can actually run a comb through her hair in the shower.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this shampoo for my daughter. She is 20 months old and has about as much hair as a 9 month old. Poor little thing. She has started sleeping on her back again and when she wakes up she will rub the back of her head all over her crib. This has started making whatever little bit of hair that she has break off. I have used Wen in the past and really liked it. It helped me grow my hair out, so I thought I&#x27;d get this and try it for my little one. It seems to be working well so far. It isn&#x27;t making her hair grow any faster, but it makes it so, so shiny and makes her hair curl so beautifully. The smell is AMAZING! I just want to eat her up when she gets out of the bath. (Not really, that&#x27;s just a figure of speech. Ha-ha!) It is just a super fresh, sweet, tangy Green Apple scent that just smells so good. The scent also lasts for several days. I don&#x27;t give her baths too often because she has terrible eczema and baths make it flair up, so she goes several days in between baths and this scent lasts so much longer than the old stuff we used.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  My daughter loves using it also as it eliminates the need to use two products. Hence it&#x27;s faster washing her hair. In addition it leaves her hair tangle free and with less frizz..</li>
