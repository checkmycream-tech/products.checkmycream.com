      <li>I use them every night, and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>They are kind of a pain in the ass to put on because you have to hold your wrinkles apart while applying</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the frownies forehead and between the eyes, I couldn&#x27;t honestly tell any difference</li>
      <li>Otherwise you risk making your wrinkles more permanent.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>Frownies are so much better and the water based glue washes away with just water.</li>
      <li>Love these, been using for years.  </li>
      <li>I use both of them, mostly Frownies as I find it stronger and thereby giving it a better effect.</li>
      <li>more frown lines.</li>
      <li>I really like the Frownie products, they all work great.</li>
      <li>If u are discipline and wear these in ur sleep , your frowns will diminsh :))</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t afford Botox, they are a pretty good replacement.</li>
      <li>This is  my favorite as I prefer the original that needs to be moistened before using.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend them.  </li>
      <li>I bet someone with a lot of time on their hands could make their own;-)</li>
      <li>The shipment fine.</li>
      <li>Love these and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Sometimes after a stressful day I get couple fine frowning wrinkles, but Frownies smooth them out during the night application.</li>
      <li>If you keep your supply in the bathroom, best to keep them sealed in the little plastic bag to keep the humidity out.  </li>
      <li>Wrinkle free for 8 hours a day.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re helping me smooth the ones already there.</li>
      <li>This is a relatively cheap, and virtually painless non-invasive fix for us all.  </li>
      <li>Frownies and Furlesse are both a great idea, to get the face muscles to relax while sleeping and thereby minimizing deep wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I only use the forehead and between eyes frownies and have been happy with how they retrain my muscles to stay relaxed.</li>
      <li>In the morning my forehead looks smooth, but as the day goes on that effect wears off.</li>
      <li>and my forehead is smooth.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the concept of Frownies, and the price is right.</li>
      <li>I honestly think they are a better preventative measure than correcting already deep wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I just recently started using it with the Frownies Rose Water Hydrator Spray which makes the Frownies more effectual.</li>
      <li>They also will fall off pretty easily.</li>
      <li>I said if I had find them earlier I would have even greater and more permanent results</li>
      <li>They really work in not making my &amp;#34;furrow&amp;#34; between my eyebrows deeper!!</li>
      <li>They are, however, a bit unsightly when worn, you do look funny with a brown piece of paper stuck in your face!</li>
      <li>As long as your expectations are realistic, you&#x27;ll be happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Effective if used regularly.</li>
      <li>Just give me another box of Frownies, the low tech but effective way to keep forehead scrunching to a minimum.</li>
      <li>I am wearing one right now.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Frownies!</li>
      <li>The Furlesse ones are clear smooth sticker-type patches with no smell.</li>
      <li>One triangle...or two...put where exactly?  </li>
      <li>Frownies really work!</li>
      <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll love them as long</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t see this becoming part of my daily routine.</li>
      <li>The expectation was mainly because of other people loving the Frownies, I guess.  </li>
      <li>Guess I will have to live with the number 11 forever or botox!!</li>
      <li>Honestly when my Frownies run out I am not sure if I am going to order more or suck it up and spend the extra money for the Furlesse ones.</li>
      <li>and they really work.</li>
      <li>You need to re-train the muscles but these do show that it is possible to have a smooth brow again.  </li>
      <li>Haha</li>
      <li>Very noticeable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a very stressed person, always worrying about money,</li>
      <li>they definitely tighten face but are not that comfortable to wear all night like she does.</li>
      <li>These really do work for me.</li>
      <li>and they really do work.</li>
      <li>but it really does work for this discerning customer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m responsible for my day frown, not the one I get while I&#x27;m sleeping.  </li>
      <li>These are very helpful.  </li>
      <li>Maybe if I used a solvent other than water it would work better...</li>
      <li>I was the first born, very quickly followed by 2 other siblings who never gave me a moment&#x27;s peace!</li>
      <li>Also, I only just recently bothered to read reviews and based on the consistent feedback, bought the rose water; and I have to say if you really want to optimize the effect, you&#x27;ll do the same.</li>
      <li>I think they help but be aware that they don&#x27;t completely eradicate the line.  </li>
      <li>Not everyone has the same experiences, but I love them and will continue to use them as long as they are made.</li>
      <li>I need them in a straight wide strip right across my forehead.  </li>
      <li>The first night I put it on, it was on the pillow next to me in the morning, so I figured it wasn&#x27;t going to work.</li>
      <li>I think that they do the same exact thing, except the frownies are rigid construction paper-like patches with smelly glue to stick them on your forehead.</li>
      <li>I have been using these for over 30 years and a lot less expensive than Botox, just my husband didn&#x27;t like otherwise GREAT!</li>
      <li>You have to be careful when applying ,as when you smooth out the area it pushes the skin up at the edges of the patch and you find a new wrinkle there next morning.</li>
      <li>Pure and simple.</li>
      <li>Without it, my forehead would no be showing clear evidence of tiredness, stress, and what ahve you; the years&#x27; wear and tear.</li>
      <li>I like the natural approach although its a bit overpriced for triangles of packing tape.</li>
      <li>I am almost 60yrs old.</li>
      <li>I think if you could actually wear the things out in public, when you are actually making many facial expressions, these would help by limiting that.  </li>
      <li>and so far can see no difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>The crease has been reduced considerably.</li>
      <li>I really thought it would help the frown line above my nose between my eyes....</li>
      <li>Recently, I have noticed that the little crinkles between my eyes don&#x27;t magically disappear when I change expressions the way they used to when I was younger.  </li>
      <li>Just be sure to pull the forehead flat before sticking the Frownie on there, and hold it until it sticks (usually 6 to 10 seconds).  </li>
      <li>Once they dry, they&#x27;re stuck on very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its worth a try to smooth a bit of squinting frown lines, looks quite silly stuck to face........</li>
      <li>This box didn&#x27;t stick or stay on for more than a few hours causing me to have to use a few for one night and having to get up and reapply a new one or just finding they had fallen off during the night which serve no purpose.</li>
      <li>Even if I make an effort to not scowl during the day, I apparently do while I am asleep</li>
      <li>So far, they have not worked for me, but I will use the entire box up before making a final judgment.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 3+ years. Without it, my forehead would no be showing clear evidence of tiredness, stress, and what ahve you; the years&#x27; wear and tear. I must say this is one of the very few to none options to keep a youthful looking without the cost of surgery.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, yes this and, like everything else, persistence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it at least 4 times a week at night.</li>
    <li> Rather then botox this is an option.</li>
    <li> Love these, been using for years.  Good price, here.</li>
    <li> THAT&#x27;S ALL  I HATED THEM</li>
    <li> I really see a difference in my horizontal forehead lines, but I wish they would make a wide, solid strip that would totally cover my forehead so I wouldn&#x27;t have to trim it shape and also wouldn&#x27;t have the odd little lines in the middle from the triangular perforations.  I cannot imagine what they mean that these are for the forehead, otherwise.  One triangle...or two...put where exactly?  I need them in a straight wide strip right across my forehead.  I have tried other brands that are plastic and forehead-shaped, but they cost a fortune for only two of them, so I will continue to cut these to my forehead requirements.  I want just one big wide strip across the whole forehead and I would look ten years younger with no fuss!  These things really do flatten out those nasty ruts, which I have had since I was about 27 because I raise my eyebrows a lot and my muscles furrow that way.  They look like streetcar tracks and I hate them, so I will continue to use these things.</li>
    <li> I have used them several times now and so far can see no difference in my skin. In don&#x27;t know how long it will take to work. A bit uncomfortable to wear. You have to be careful when applying ,as when you smooth out the area it pushes the skin up at the edges of the patch and you find a new wrinkle there next morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year and this last box was a huge disappointment. Typically after being moistened and placed they stayed on well through the night. But I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formulation of the paste that kept them on or what. This box didn&#x27;t stick or stay on for more than a few hours causing me to have to use a few for one night and having to get up and reapply a new one or just finding they had fallen off during the night which serve no purpose. Very disappointed. Now I have to look for an alternative brand!</li>
    <li> No Botox, face lifts or facial fillers for me. Just give me another box of Frownies, the low tech but effective way to keep forehead scrunching to a minimum.</li>
    <li> My wife loved these Frownies! Really great, the wrinkles are disappearing!</li>
    <li> Been wearing these every night since I purchased them..no difference. I had hope but not any more :( Guess I will have to live with the number 11 forever or botox!!</li>
    <li> I love these. I put one on every night. I am wearing one right now. If you can&#x27;t afford Botox, they are a pretty good replacement.</li>
    <li> Looks silly but works. I constantly squeeze my eyebrows togethet and this product trains the muscles into staying put. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for over 30 years and a lot less expensive than Botox, just my husband didn&#x27;t like otherwise GREAT!</li>
    <li> Yes these actually work to keep away frowns. I do it in my sleep.</li>
    <li> I found it hard to attach them in the correct spot between the eyes. I wish they were in a square or rectangle. I do use the rosewater so they do stick. So far, they have not worked for me, but I will use the entire box up before making a final judgment.</li>
    <li> I have used  Frownies (forehead/eyes) over the years and always loved the way they work - but I could not buy them locally and depended on having a friend mail them to me.  Recently decided I had to use them again as my frown lines between my eyes were severe - so purchased two boxes on Amazon and they are still amazing!  Should have never stopped using them.  They make such a difference.  I strongly recommend them.  Frownies rock!</li>
    <li> If u are discipline and wear these in ur sleep , your frowns will diminsh :))&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff and the company that makes it has been in business forever</li>
    <li> I use the frownies every night for the line that has started between my forehead.  I think they help but be aware that they don&#x27;t completely eradicate the line.  For someone like me who tends to furrow my brow, even at night, they help retrain those muscles.</li>
    <li> This product works to help you remember not to crinkle your brow. I&#x27;ve been using for several years and find them calming, too.</li>
    <li> Frownies and Furlesse are both a great idea, to get the face muscles to relax while sleeping and thereby minimizing deep wrinkles. It has helped keeping those angry between the eyebrows furrows away... I use both of them, mostly Frownies as I find it stronger and thereby giving it a better effect. They are, however, a bit unsightly when worn, you do look funny with a brown piece of paper stuck in your face! I try put them on after everyone is already in bed at home...and when I don&#x27;t want to bother with paper that takes a little longer to put on I just use Furlesse for a change.</li>
    <li> i thought this would help me as i have deep frown lines on my forehead but not really helping me</li>
    <li> These are very helpful.  Of course you still need to make efforts not to frown after they are off.  You need to re-train the muscles but these do show that it is possible to have a smooth brow again.  It seems helps relax and retrain the muscles.</li>
    <li> Frownies do what they say they do.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m responsible for my day frown, not the one I get while I&#x27;m sleeping.  This helps keep my frown from getting deeper at night.</li>
    <li> Stiff paper makes for very uncomfortable product.</li>
    <li> I swear by them.  I use to frown a lot and these help to reverse what you have been doing. I use them at night and wake up and my forehead is smooth.</li>
    <li> I wear these to bed every night between my eyebrows when I sleep and I feel they  help keep my one frown line to a minimum.</li>
    <li> These are so great. I wish I had found them earlier in life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have wrinkles from expression lines (like the 11 between your eyes)put them on properly and go to bed, when you wake up there are simply NO sign off the wrinkles. It is not permanent, as when you use your face over and over these lines come back. HOWEVER, if you use them regularly it fights the progression of those lines as when you have them on those lines are not increasing. Used with other she repair positives, you can&#x27;t beat them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just noticing the beginning of expression lines, start using these! You&#x27;ll put off aging significantly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also wear them around the house during the day and for shorter periods this obviously helps. What you are doing is stopping your skin - that has now lost out is losing its ability to unwrinkle after being wrinkled into an expression- from deepening that groove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love them as long add you understand what they do and don&#x27;t do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said if I had find them earlier I would have even greater and more permanent results</li>
    <li> Everything is good. Nothing to complain. The product is perfect. The shipment fine. What else do you wnat me to say?</li>
    <li> I may have been expecting a miracle!  But the Frownies did not do anything for the couple small wrinkles.  I really thought it would help the frown line above my nose between my eyes....but nothing.  Now I didn&#x27;t expect Frownies to take it away....but did think and hoped that it would make it look a little smaller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Frownies in the past.  They work great, basically by relaxing your frown area to make the appearance smoother.  I use them overnight sometimes.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Frownies are not a replacement for botox, fillers, laser resurfacing or any of those expensive wrinkle erasers. They will not make your lines disappear, but they can help minimize them for a bit. I put them on at night after I&#x27;ve cleansed my face, and I do like the &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; effect they give you as they hold your face from scrunching and squinting. In the morning my forehead looks smooth, but as the day goes on that effect wears off. As long as your expectations are realistic, you&#x27;ll be happy with this product. My only real complaint about this product is that it is too expensive for what it really is: individually cut, heavy duty packaging tape. Seriously, try out packaging tape and see if you don&#x27;t get similar results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  So far, so good.  I will continue to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more frown lines.</li>
    <li> Don&amp;#34;t waste your money. I had to give one star to review or I would have given zero stars. Buy something that works.</li>
    <li> Good product.  A far less expensive treatment for frown lines between the eyes than Botox .  Effective if used regularly.</li>
    <li> It did not do as advertised, I am very very disappointed.  I follow the instructions and apply it every night but the lines are still there.</li>
    <li> Like some others, I tried this product because of Racquel Welch&#x27;s book, and her passage that she uses them.  I have been trying different ways of putting them on my face (ie, wearing as is, cutting them, etc., been going online to find out tips from others), but I guess I may have expected too much.  The expectation was mainly because of other people loving the Frownies, I guess.  I&#x27;ll use up what I have, but won&#x27;t buy again.  Too bad.  Here&#x27;s the thing:  I think if you could actually wear the things out in public, when you are actually making many facial expressions, these would help by limiting that.  I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re helping me smooth the ones already there. If anyone felt the same as me, but figured them out in the end, I would appreciate the advice.</li>
    <li> My mom loves these so I thought I&#x27;d try...they definitely tighten face but are not that comfortable to wear all night like she does.</li>
    <li> Cannot believe I fell for this.  Frown lines are caused by muscle contraction.  To flatten the skin, after wearing the frownies all night, lasts about 10 minutes and the frown lines are back.  Unfortunately, this &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; would be too easy.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than a $20,000 face lift. I use them every night, and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> A+ item, that is all I have to say, plain and simple.</li>
    <li> Awful. Won&#x27;t stay on. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> If you can cut down the amount of time you spend creating frown lines by one third, then why wouldn&#x27;t you? Wrinkle free for 8 hours a day. Woo-hoo!</li>
    <li> I use these every night and they have slowed down the wrinkle development on my forehead. I&#x27;ve used these over the years and have noticed that over time, they have reduced the number of Frownies in the box while increasing the price.....That&#x27;s a bit disappointing.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annoying and ugly to wear to bed, but there it is, these have been part of the daily routine for months (years?)</li>
    <li> Have been using Frownies for 4-5 years. I&#x27;m 32 and still have no forehead or between the eyebrows wrinkles. Sometimes after a stressful day I get couple fine frowning wrinkles, but Frownies smooth them out during the night application. Additionally, they make you aware of excessive frowning or grimacing, therefore you are less prone to get deep wrinkles. Result: youthful looking skin and no side effects of facial injections!</li>
    <li> I am a frowner.  I have used these for at least 25 years between my eyebrows and they really help.  They used to come in a box of 300 which cost less than the current box of 144!  If you keep your supply in the bathroom, best to keep them sealed in the little plastic bag to keep the humidity out.  I have found that I can usually re-use one a couple of times with no loss of quality.  I wear one to bed nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a manufacturer of a similar product made of plastic with adhesive that doesn&#x27;t need wetting, so it is easier to apply.  However, you can see where they were on your skin after removal, and I found it very difficult to remove the adhesive left behind on my face.  Frownies are so much better and the water based glue washes away with just water.</li>
    <li> This is the best! I have been using this for at least 12 years. Not one wrinkle between my eyes.... I am almost 60yrs old.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. And I do believe they make a difference while I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
    <li> I think that these work okay. They are kind of a pain in the ass to put on because you have to hold your wrinkles apart while applying and while you&#x27;re waiting for them to dry. Otherwise you risk making your wrinkles more permanent. They also will fall off pretty easily. Maybe if I used a solvent other than water it would work better...I honestly think they are a better preventative measure than correcting already deep wrinkles. The one time I did get them to work, it did make my skin look better in the morning, but it&#x27;s not worth the hassle, at least for me. I can&#x27;t see this becoming part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I use them every night when I don&#x27;t use a peel. They smell and sometimes I get whiffs of it once applied. The lines look less dramatic when I remove them the next morning. But they return by bedtime. I have this rationale that I am preventing these expressions for a least 7 hours of every day and that it makes a difference in the long run. Haha</li>
    <li> I like it, it is work</li>
    <li> Love these and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I like the natural approach although its a bit overpriced for triangles of packing tape. I bet someone with a lot of time on their hands could make their own;-) Its worth a try to smooth a bit of squinting frown lines, looks quite silly stuck to face........</li>
    <li> Frownies really work!</li>
    <li> These things work.  Pure and simple. Without Botox, either.  If you forget to apply one night, you can see the difference in the morning.  I believe that if you start after you have deep wrinkles, it would be harder to erase.  By starting as you see frown lines developing, you can keep them at bay and possibly lessen the depth of them.  Works for me.  I keep several boxes on hand and re-order when I open the last box.  Just be sure to pull the forehead flat before sticking the Frownie on there, and hold it until it sticks (usually 6 to 10 seconds).  If not, you are deepening the furrows instead of erasing them!  This is a relatively cheap, and virtually painless non-invasive fix for us all.  Thanks, Frownies!</li>
    <li> I have used these for two years now at night while I sleep. They really work in not making my &amp;#34;furrow&amp;#34; between my eyebrows deeper!! You&#x27;re not putting questionable toxins in your body and they are inexpensive.</li>
    <li> keeps me from having to get a face lift</li>
    <li> Who would expect that slapping on a piece of what is essentially packing tape would be a wrinkle preventative?  Recently, I have noticed that the little crinkles between my eyes don&#x27;t magically disappear when I change expressions the way they used to when I was younger.  Even if I make an effort to not scowl during the day, I apparently do while I am asleep or I crunch my face in my pillow because I wake up with them and they stay with me all day.  With Frownies I wake up with no lines, and as long as I am not too crotchety during the day, they stay gone.  I find the triangle shape to be uncomfortable and itchy, so I just cut them into little oblong pieces and put one on each side.  Then I sleep without even knowing they are there.  They are now a permanent part of my nightly routine.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the concept of Frownies, and the price is right. However before I used Frownies I had received a sample of the Furlesse wrinkle patches in a beauty bag, and I was thinking that Frownies would be the same. Well, they&#x27;re not. I think that they do the same exact thing, except the frownies are rigid construction paper-like patches with smelly glue to stick them on your forehead. The Furlesse ones are clear smooth sticker-type patches with no smell. Honestly when my Frownies run out I am not sure if I am going to order more or suck it up and spend the extra money for the Furlesse ones. Decisions, decisions.</li>
    <li> I have been frowning all my life! I was the first born, very quickly followed by 2 other siblings who never gave me a moment&#x27;s peace! My mother used to tell me if I kept frowning, my face would stay that way and my ex boyfriend said the same (I never scolded him about his weight problem). I&#x27;m a very stressed person, always worrying about money, dire circumstances and everything else under the sun. So when I say these little triangles truly lift me up--this is no joke! Every night before I go to sleep, I diligently apply my Frownies triangle between my eyes and give myself a break! It works, but you should do it every night to look good long-term. Also, I only just recently bothered to read reviews and based on the consistent feedback, bought the rose water; and I have to say if you really want to optimize the effect, you&#x27;ll do the same. Using just water is a half-baked attempt, so I learned the hard way. Frownies may be the poor girl&#x27;s cosmetic surgery but it really does work for this discerning customer. I&#x27;d rather spend a little money on preventing further lines!</li>
    <li> Because I had Bells Palsy which is a condition that paralyzes the facial nerve on one side of your face, I have an awful crease right between my eyes. Very noticeable. Creams didn&#x27;t do a thing, so I thought I&#x27;d give frownies a try. The first night I put it on, it was on the pillow next to me in the morning, so I figured it wasn&#x27;t going to work. Well, I kept trying and they really work. The crease has been reduced considerably. Maybe they didn&#x27;t work for other users. Not everyone has the same experiences, but I love them and will continue to use them as long as they are made.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years.  I just recently started using it with the Frownies Rose Water Hydrator Spray which makes the Frownies more effectual.</li>
    <li> Frownies are amazing!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the frownies forehead and between the eyes, I couldn&#x27;t honestly tell any difference, I personally feel like I wasted my money on this item.</li>
    <li> Works! And wearing them even helps my stress level because if I frown - I am immediately reminded to relax.</li>
    <li> I really like the Frownie products, they all work great. This is  my favorite as I prefer the original that needs to be moistened before using. These are little triangles that you moisten and place on your forehead between your brows. I use them every night or during the day when home alone and they really do work.</li>
    <li> These really do work for me. I only use the forehead and between eyes frownies and have been happy with how they retrain my muscles to stay relaxed. My wrinkles on my forehead and between my eyes are not too deep, so after a few days of using this product, you can barely see the lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to address some of the complaints regarding the glue. Some of the reviewers have said that they are not sticky enough for them, but I have found them always to be sticky enough. If I apply them to my forehead and they don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re laying flat and sticking, I simply place a damp rag over them (while they&#x27;re in place on my face) for a little while and they relax and lay on my forehead. Once they dry, they&#x27;re stuck on very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have expressed that the frownies are painful when they rip them off. I would suggest wetting them again before removal.</li>
    <li> I will always order my &amp;#34;frownies&amp;#34;. A part of my nightly beauty regime.</li>
    <li> Works well to prevent frowning at night</li>
