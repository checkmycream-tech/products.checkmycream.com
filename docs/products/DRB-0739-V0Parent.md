<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great soap.  I use it for regular use and hiking.  The seller was kind enough to give me a discount when the order messed up.  Much appreciated!</li>
    <li> This is gentler than the peppermint castile soap.  I love the peppermint soap but some of my family members wanted something milder.  They love the orange.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m a dyed-in-the-wool fan of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint sometimes ya gotta mix it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same amazing quality soap, nice scent!</li>
    <li> Just as a matter of preference, I do not like the citrus smell of this Castile Liquid Soap. It smells a little too industrial to me rather than like real oranges or citrus. However, the soap is very much like other Castile soaps in that it only takes a little dab to do the job.</li>
    <li> Works great, use it for everything, cleaning, doing dishes, you name it, even laundry detergent. Not a bubbly as normal detergents but i think its far better.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soap for over 20 years.  The Citrus is my favorite!</li>
    <li> It smells kinda like dish soap but in a good way. I was concerned that it was not going to be a lot of soap for the money but I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it- this stuff will last I long time. I use it with a shower puff and it does create lots of bubbles, I use about a teaspoon at a time and that&#x27;s plenty (other reviews said it doesn&#x27;t create bubbles, that wasn&#x27;t true for me).</li>
    <li> good healthy alternative to soaps and cleaning products.</li>
    <li> I have been using Castile soap with peppermint for many years.  I am so happy to find this citrus infused Castile soap.  It is gentle and the fragrance is not very strong.</li>
    <li> I use just 2 T in a cup of water for my hand washing pumps. A LOT cheaper and no toxic chemicals and just fine for regular hand washing. There are lots of uses for this, take a look at the packaging.</li>
    <li> When I first heard of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Liquid Soap... I thought this has got to be too good to be true. But, I did more and more research and decided to try it. Besides, anything that is all natural can&#x27;t be that bad right? WOW! That is my reaction to this amazing liquid soap. I am an amputee. I have to be extremely careful about the types of soaps and things I use on my liner and my skin. It is inside this silicone liner all day and it leaves my skin raw and very painful sometimes. I used this soon after I got it and it didn&#x27;t burn the way all the other soaps did. I didn&#x27;t break out and it took the smell out of my liner. I know that sounds horrible, but if there are any amputees out there, then they know exactly what I am talking about. I also washed my face with it and my prosthetic leg...my hair...the bathroom counter, the rubber foot on my prosthetic leg...the toilet, the floor in the bathroom and the hall...I did the shower...AMAZING!!! All of that and I only used maybe a teaspoon of this stuff!!!! If that...I mean it was two or three drops for my face and I do mean drops....and it was about 4 for the counter. I used more to wash me and the floor. Because this one was citrus, I loved the lemony-orangey smell I got out of it immediately. And when I later smelled my skin, I just smelled soap and water clean...this was hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor....throw out everything you are currently using...buy a bottle of this...at the rate I am using it, I will not even be through with this bottle in a year, maybe two. And I am one of those people who uses too much of everything. I want to be clean and I want everything else to be clean too! I moisturized my skin with sweet almond oil mixed with a little coconut oil...wow! I just can&#x27;t tell you enough good things about this soap. I am going to try washing my clothing with it next and my dishes...who knows what else...maybe the dog too. I will update in a month and let y&#x27;all know how this is going...I am OCD when it comes to clean...so I want to see how much of this I really use in a month&#x27;s time if it is the only thing I am using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side note:if you use this to wash your hair, make sure you use a good conditioner after....something with NO silicone or dimethicone in it. It will just make your hair hard to work with...but if you use something without those two things, you will be amazed at how your hair will love you back....I have wavy, red, colored hair...very, very thick. It is always frizzy and dry. I did a hot oil treatment before cleansing with this soap. I used coconut oil and sweet almond oil and a little shea butter. I left that in for a day and then went and washed it that evening. I only used a little sweet almond oil in it when I got out of the shower and I shampooed twice...there is not a lot of lather...amazingly soft and shiny...my hair was gorgeous. I have never gotten so many compliments before...ok. I will update later on this...but right now, I am happy and give two enthusiastic thumbs up. ;)OCD when it comes to clean...so I want to see how much of this I really use in a month&#x27;s time if it is the only thing I am using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side note:if you use this to wash your hair, make sure you use a good conditioner after....something with NO silicone or dimethicone in it.

    <li> I dilute it 1 part soap and 5 parts water in a foam hand soap dispenser, works great.  I also use it about 1:4 for shower and shampoo.  For all purpose kitchen spray I dilute 1:40 in a 32oz sprayer (4/5th of an oz. then fill rest with water).  Peppermint for the shower, Lavender for the hand soap, and Tea Tree for general household cleaning.  Works great for everything!</li>
    <li> I love the soap.  It smells good and is gentle on my face.</li>
    <li> You really don&#x27;t need anything else to get yourself clean. Washes the whole self and speaks the language of living cells. Just pick your fragrance.</li>
    <li> No matter how I used this product my hair was grease pit. I then developed a rash on the back of head and neck as an allergic reaction as well.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronners, it is CLEAN soap, no parabens, phalates or however you spell all those nasty chemicals put into liquid body wash.&lt;br /&gt;The citrus Dr. Bronners is hard to find and my favorite one out of all the varieties.  Thanks for stocking it Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have had a bottle of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint for YEARS.  I use it for everything, but since you only need a little I have had the same bottle for a long time.  I use a squirt in a small bucket of water for cleaning, a squirt on my washcloth for me, I wash my hair with it if it seems like I have build-up, and a squirt in with my regular detergent in my laundry (your clothes will be SO SOFT and smell great).  I decided to purchase another scent to see how it was.  To me, the new bottle does not work as well, but it is still fine.  I compared the ingredients list and they are very different.  I still love it, but definitely think my old formula works better and I wonder why they changed it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Liquid in the Lemon and the Bar in the Peppermint love the both the bar is very creamy I love to use it on my face and feels so good great price will be trying other scents in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr.Bonners castile liquid soap for several years. It is far superior to any popular bar soap. I have recommended this product to friends and family and they agree.</li>
    <li> The citrus felt like it made my skin too dry.  I like the hemp soap better.</li>
    <li> Because the scent is &amp;#34;citrus,&amp;#34; I was expecting something more orange or grapefruit.  This is more lemon-y.  Fantastic soap!  Unlike a lot of big brand soaps, this actually gets grease off and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
    <li> I like anything citrus scented, and this has a nice soft, not-too-crazy citrus scent that I enjoy. It&#x27;s nice on my skin, not overly drying at all. I sometimes just add some to my regular body wash on the shower pouf, to bump up the suds and scent of my regular stuff.</li>
    <li> Love.  Work in so many ways.  Especially like it to make my own foaming soap.  Half an inch in a bottle with a foaming top, fill with water and a better alternative to the pricey heavily fragranced BBW options.</li>
    <li> We purchased this product to make homemade soap and no issues with this at all.  I&#x27;d recommend for others for sure.</li>
    <li> The citrus scent is my favorite by far! I use Dr. Bronners for just about everything, My favorite this to use it an all purpose spray I make with 32 oz of water, 2 tsp Dr. Bronners and 2 tsp Borax (sold at walmart and other grocery stores in the laundry isle). It cleans like a dream! Gets a grimy stove clean with hardly any scrubbing!</li>
    <li> fantastic product!! the whole range...so foamy and so efficient!! a bottle lasts a really long time...a few drops are enough to fill you with suds! very light and gentle...how did i live before without it?</li>
</ol>
