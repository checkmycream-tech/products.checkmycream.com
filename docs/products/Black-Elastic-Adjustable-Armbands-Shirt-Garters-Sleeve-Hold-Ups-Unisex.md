### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>They are a great product.  </li>
      <li>I will give them a good workout.</li>
      <li>Quality is very good and price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>Work with any kind of fabric; I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
      <li>Most sets probably don&#x27;t have this defect.</li>
      <li>If I were to purchase these in a retail store I would never pay more than $6-7.</li>
      <li>I hope I will love them.</li>
      <li>Okay, a indicated in the picture and described</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d probably get more.</li>
      <li>Love these to keep my sleeves up</li>
      <li>They are all of better quality than these, with wider,softer elastic, leather trim, and better clasps.</li>
      <li>Probably would have been better if I did not buy it around Halloween, but things happen.</li>
      <li>I thought I was getting something better.</li>
      <li>They work just fine.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re comfortable and keep sleeves up without a problem.  </li>
      <li>Great for holding my sleeves back</li>
      <li>They love them for the use of keeping their shirt sleeves exactly in place where they like them.</li>
      <li>These are a very good product and should outlast the cheaper ones I had previously.  </li>
      <li>They tend to slip on silky fabric, but work great on other materials &amp; sweaters.</li>
      <li>Had I been able to see these arm bands in person, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased them, particularly at the $19.95 price point.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t see any other good options out there.  </li>
      <li>: they&#x27;re adjustable, and not very wide, so they&#x27;re not too noticeable, and most of all, they do the job</li>
      <li>Love them I wear them with my suit, they fit as expected, not uncomfortable at all..</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>Would expect a much higher quality product for the price.  </li>
      <li>Great present for Christmas or birthdays or any other occasion.</li>
      <li>but they were/are a hard to find novelty item, they may be feminine but seem to have good construction</li>
      <li>Very helpful.  </li>
      <li>These work very well</li>
      <li>While this procuct accomplished it&#x27;s purpose, it didn&#x27;t last long since I have big arms and this product stretches out of shape too easily.</li>
      <li>A bit expensive for what they are, but it filled an important niche in my black-tie wardrobe.</li>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t comfortable to wear as the elastic has no give to it, and they are not handsome to look at - they are functional - for now (the soft metal clasps are already on the edge of failure) but cheap looking.  </li>
      <li>The armbands that came in worked as they were supposed to for the first few days.</li>
      <li>I have several sets of  similar type &#x27;armbands&#x27; purchased in foreign stores where they seem to be more common than in the U.S.</li>

<li> I bought these to hold my raincoat sleeves down while riding my motorcycle.</li>
<li> Other than that, there are no issues and I continue to wear them with every button-down shirt I have!</li>
<li> They are black.  </li>
<li> they look a bit feminine on me and the price was a little steep.</li>
<li> The metal clasps are very poor quality and won&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> The elastic is stiff black and narrow.</li>
<li> I am tired of using rubber binders to keep the jacket sleeves pushed back from my wrists.</li>
<li> One of the armbands was twisted 180 degrees.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t get them all dirty and greasy, when I&#x27;m working on bikes in the shop.</li>
<li> and sometimes they just won&#x27;t stay up, annoying me at work.</li>

    <li> Love them I wear them with my suit, they fit as expected, not uncomfortable at all..</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Very helpful.  Would expect a much higher quality product for the price.  If I were to purchase these in a retail store I would never pay more than $6-7.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Now I can wear shirts made with flared sleeves .</li>
    <li> i only gave this item 3 stars because i thought the armbands would be wider. they look a bit feminine on me and the price was a little steep. but they were/are a hard to find novelty item, they may be feminine but seem to have good construction</li>
    <li> They are a great product.  Great for holding my sleeves back so I don&#x27;t get them all dirty and greasy, when I&#x27;m working on bikes in the shop. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Been using them for years.&lt;br /&gt;Beats spending part of your day tugging at your sleeves.</li>
    <li> I have several sets of  similar type &#x27;armbands&#x27; purchased in foreign stores where they seem to be more common than in the U.S. They are all of better quality than these, with wider,softer elastic, leather trim, and better clasps. They were also cheaper than these. Had I been able to see these arm bands in person, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased them, particularly at the $19.95 price point. The metal clasps are very poor quality and won&#x27;t last long. The elastic is stiff black and narrow. These aren&#x27;t comfortable to wear as the elastic has no give to it, and they are not handsome to look at - they are functional - for now (the soft metal clasps are already on the edge of failure) but cheap looking.  I recommend saving your $20</li>
    <li> They work!  They&#x27;re comfortable and keep sleeves up without a problem.  If long sleeves are too long and you don&#x27;t want to have the shirt tailored or it&#x27;s a pullover knit, these are for you.  Work with any kind of fabric; I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
    <li> Probably would have been better if I did not buy it around Halloween, but things happen. Made the costume I suppose.</li>
    <li> The armbands that came in worked as they were supposed to for the first few days. Later though, one of the armbands tore apart because of some loose threads. I had to staple that certain part together and ever since then, I&#x27;ve been paranoid about pulling the other armband too hard because it might also come apart. Other than that, there are no issues and I continue to wear them with every button-down shirt I have!</li>
    <li> I bought these to hold my raincoat sleeves down while riding my motorcycle. Works great!</li>
    <li> While this procuct accomplished it&#x27;s purpose, it didn&#x27;t last long since I have big arms and this product stretches out of shape too easily.</li>
    <li> With long sleeved sweaters and t-shirts. I prefer them pushed up and sometimes they just won&#x27;t stay up, annoying me at work.</li>
    <li> Love these to keep my sleeves up</li>
    <li> These are a very good product and should outlast the cheaper ones I had previously.  I like the adjustable ability of them.</li>
    <li> These work very well: they&#x27;re adjustable, and not very wide, so they&#x27;re not too noticeable, and most of all, they do the job</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these for awhile. They tend to slip on silky fabric, but work great on other materials &amp; sweaters.</li>
    <li> Seems a bit pricey for what it is, but they&#x27;ve worked well for me and I don&#x27;t see any other good options out there.  In reality, if they made them in a darker brown or perhaps even some other colors I&#x27;d probably get more.</li>
    <li> I am tired of using rubber binders to keep the jacket sleeves pushed back from my wrists. Now that fall is coming I will give them a good workout. I hope I will love them.</li>
    <li> They are black.  They work just fine.  I like the adjustablilty.  But, I have lost them already.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised.  A bit expensive for what they are, but it filled an important niche in my black-tie wardrobe.</li>
    <li> The armbands do what I need them to.</li>
    <li> Would have been fine, but one of the bands was twisted half inside-out, making it nonadjustable. Wrote to the company and heard nothing. Most sets probably don&#x27;t have this defect.</li>
    <li> One of the armbands was twisted 180 degrees. Have to take it apart to fix faulty workmanship.</li>
    <li> They are not the quality I thought they were.  They seem cheap and they were too expensive.  I thought I was getting something better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband and Pastor. They love them for the use of keeping their shirt sleeves exactly in place where they like them.</li>
    <li> This shirt garter met and exceeded all of  my expectations. Quality is very good and price was reasonable. Great present for Christmas or birthdays or any other occasion.</li>
    <li> Okay, a indicated in the picture and described</li>
