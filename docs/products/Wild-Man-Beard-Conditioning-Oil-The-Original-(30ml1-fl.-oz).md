      <li>Overall very happy with this beard oil.</li>
      <li>After reviewing many products and looking into the usage of beard oils I decided to go with this product.</li>
      <li>Though I like the &#x27;Raven&#x27; formula smell better.  </li>
      <li>I  used a better beard softener but can not remember the name of it.</li>
      <li>I love it...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never felt more manly in my life.</li>
      <li>Cute packaging (</li>
      <li>I love this beard oil.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the packaging, as this was a humorous gift for my brother.</li>
      <li>The product is simply okay.</li>
      <li>We have continued to use it as well as more products from this line.</li>
      <li>I gave it four stars because I love the scent</li>
      <li>I used this product for a month or more.</li>
      <li>More like Mountain Man Pine.</li>
      <li>, I love that kissing him is no longer like making out with a brillo pad.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this oil and use 2-4 drops after showering and drying my beard.</li>
      <li>Maybe a dropper would be better...</li>
      <li>but the intensity wears off very quick and then is mild and nice.</li>
      <li>Smells good not over powering, but very settle.</li>
      <li>It is a pain attempting to get some out with the cap it has, but it easily comes off so you can pour it out instead.</li>
      <li>Good looking bottle, product smells nice and when you finally get a drop or two out its easy</li>
      <li>This product has a strong, mountain-man smell.</li>
      <li>Helped my beard look more full and darker.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the scent, a kind of outdoorsy and woodsy scent, and was complimented on it multiple times.</li>
      <li>I would apply it with cotton balls then brush it in with a fine comb or fine brush.</li>
      <li>Liked this product, may just need something a bit stronger, have a very pointy mustache, it did soften a bit.</li>
      <li>smooth groove on some using this majic juice.</li>
      <li>I have not tried others but i enjoy this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll order another bottle when it&#x27;s available on Amazon...  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that creatures of the wild take more kindly to my presence.</li>
      <li>I was worried that the smell would be overpowering (quite strong out of the bottle), but it fades when it is applied to the hair and skin fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>It should come with a different kind of dispenser top because the one it comes with is whack.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my beard soft and smells nice (in a rustic way).</li>
      <li>The smell is not bad.  </li>
      <li>Love that it is natural and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Other reviewers don&#x27;t like the bottle, but it&#x27;s great if you use it the way it was made.</li>
      <li>Love the way it smells, and it had made his beard super soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to order something that actually does what it says it does.&lt;br</li>
      <li>OK, day 2 of using Wild Man Conditioning Oil.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time growing a full beard.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth buying</li>
      <li>it is pretty strong, a real herby smell</li>
      <li>It is a very strong musk scent but wears off after a few minutes so its not so overwhelming.</li>
      <li>priced right.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>this stuff smells clean and woodsy, goes on without feeling greasy and adds a subtle shine that feels great on the skin-</li>
      <li>My hubby has a long beard and it looks nice when he puts this stuff in it.</li>
      <li>I have learned that it helps more so if you are starting fresh with a beard.</li>
      <li>used 4 drops, I might use more, as it didn&#x27;t feel like quite enough.</li>
      <li>bottle top has to be redesigned, its a nightmare trying to get the necessary amout out without flinging the stuff everywhere.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I like the smell, first beard oil</li>
      <li>and I will most likely always have a bottle on hand.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using a beard oil.</li>
      <li>On the basis of this I&#x27;ll probably be buying more grooming products from this same company.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t feel like I spent too much on it honestly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been growing a beard for more than a decade now, but normally keep it trim enough</li>
      <li>I use this stuff about once a week, more when it&#x27;s dry out.</li>
      <li>The stray hairs are much more easily contained and it feels soft like a down pillow, upon which every woman I&#x27;ve encountered wants to nap.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle, but I think that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. I suggest only buying if you have a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; beard. If you want to control messy stubble, buy any conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to having a &#x27;stache and mine grew in bristly, uncomfortable. In reading up on how to maintain your facial hair properly I found a refefence to conditioning oil and, after having read the reviews, ordered this product. It took me a while to realize that they weren&#x27;t kidding when they said you only needed very little but once I solved that problem, I got right into the process of using it at least everyday, sometimes oftener, and also realized that some stiffness was good as that helped in shaping your moustache. Excellent product, well priced and, most importantly, it does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a package with 2 bottles of Conditioner and 1 container of their Beard Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products have exceeded my expectations, which is great because I just got into growing a beard and wet-shaving. They both require a whole new range of products that i have never used before. It&#x27;s nice to order something that actually does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Wild Man!</li>
    <li> I love this beard oil. It has a nice smell, it&#x27;s not oily, and it works as advertised. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like that the product is non-oily. The smell is not bad.  Though I like the &#x27;Raven&#x27; formula smell better.  Since I only need about 4 drops this bottle should last some time. I  used a better beard softener but can not remember the name of it. The price is too high.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and the oil but I feel like you really need to have a very thick and long beard to make this work 100%.</li>
    <li> The product is simply okay. I gave it four stars because I love the scent and it does help soften my beard. I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the best you can do to soften a beard. I have found a good conditioner works better at softening my beard. This product does provide a nice shine on my beard though does little to tame the wild hairs down. I love the scent. It is absolutely a manly scent but it&#x27;s not over powering either. It&#x27;s worth buying and I will most likely always have a bottle on hand.</li>
    <li> i have a 2-3&amp;#34; beard- this stuff smells clean and woodsy, goes on without feeling greasy and adds a subtle shine that feels great on the skin- highly recommend</li>
    <li> This stuff smells manly. I like the subtle wood scents. The oil is not heavy and leaves my beard feeling softer with daily use. I almost wish it were a bit heavier. Maybe I&#x27;m not using enough. It says a &amp;#34;few&amp;#34; drops on the back. I use five. I may try another oil in the future.</li>
    <li> I switched to this beard conditioning oil just the other day because my girlfriend hated how my old one smelled. This oil is great though. It has a very nice smell (mostly dominated by rosemary) and it easily blended into my beard and provided both a nice shine and a good look. It&#x27;s a little hard to get out of the bottle, but one bottle should last quite a while and was definitely worth the price. On the basis of this I&#x27;ll probably be buying more grooming products from this same company.</li>
    <li> Great smell, difficult to dispense into your hand for application.  This could have used a different method of application, like perhaps a little pump.  I have to really shake this thing to get any out.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a beard oil. After reviewing many products and looking into the usage of beard oils I decided to go with this product. I was very pleased with the scent, a kind of outdoorsy and woodsy scent, and was complimented on it multiple times. It is a pain attempting to get some out with the cap it has, but it easily comes off so you can pour it out instead. My beard is very rough and course, but this product helps in making it softer and tamer. It gives it a nice shimmer and feel for a good price.</li>
    <li> I obviously don&#x27;t have a beard. But my cousin has a big one and he loves this stuff! I gave it to him for Christmas and he was incredibly happy.</li>
    <li> This beard oil smooths out your beard while letting it keep its natural shape.  Also, it does not smell.  It has some fragrance to it but it is very slight and you will not notice it even on your moustache, which to me is important because I do not want a super perfumed beard and moustache.</li>
    <li> smooth groove on some using this majic juice. smells pleasant. priced right. good starters oil to get used to beimg the cool stache man (at least I hope you&#x27;re man)</li>
    <li> dont really have enough length to my beard to really benefit from this yet. however it really does kep the stray hairs down and makes your beard shiny and clean. a lot of people on here complain about the smell...it is pretty strong, a real herby smell but the intensity wears off very quick and then is mild and nice.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff about once a week, more when it&#x27;s dry out. Keeps my beard soft and smells nice (in a rustic way). I also use a dilute vinegar rinse on it every few weeks to keep it smooth. Very happy with my beard. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product in the past, and it has been amazing. Rich herbal odor that is quite pleasant. Recently however, the oil smells like...well...oil, with perhaps a hint of citrus. I think i got a bad batch?</li>
    <li> WMBCO seemed to soften my beard, and I&#x27;ll likely buy it again, but I thought after I used it a few times, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep my hands off myself.  As it turned out, I wouldn&#x27;t give myself the time of day. If your beard has any length to it, you&#x27;ll need more than a few drops for it to have an effect.  -Odin in Denver</li>
    <li> I ordered this product since my beard was beginning to feel somewhat stale and dry. I applied a few drops to my beard and brushed it with my boar bristle brush. It smells like my beard went for a leisurely Sunday stroll through an herb garden. The stray hairs are much more easily contained and it feels soft like a down pillow, upon which every woman I&#x27;ve encountered wants to nap. I&#x27;ve also noticed that creatures of the wild take more kindly to my presence. The other day I encountered a buck while splitting a chord of wood, and he stuck around for about 10 minutes or so before bounding back into the forest. I have to give this product 5/5 stars.</li>
    <li> It does seem to do as advertised, but the bottle is a giant pain in the butt.  It should come with a different kind of dispenser top because the one it comes with is whack.  Have to shake the hell out of it to get a few drops.</li>
    <li> This is awesome stuff, girls that like beards will love it, moisturizes how it says, smells great if you like the musky, burly manly scent. Any frontier man to Kevin Sorbo would agree! You made me a repeat customer!!</li>
    <li> Good looking bottle, product smells nice and when you finally get a drop or two out its easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle top has to be redesigned, its a nightmare trying to get the necessary amout out without flinging the stuff everywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m letting my beard grow out a bit for the winter, and my hair&#x27;s been rough and ragged, so I did some research on beard oils to condition and soften my scruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one came today, and I immediately tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice, and not too strong. I was worried after I rubbed it into my mustache it was all I&#x27;d smell, but I don&#x27;t smell it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used 4 drops, I might use more, as it didn&#x27;t feel like quite enough. But it did give my beard a nice sheen right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top is a little annoying, I turned it completely upside down and tapped the bottom, and that seemed to work fine.</li>
    <li> This is really great beard oil. It&#x27;s a bit heavier than other oils I have, so it does help with control. The smell is also milder than others.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the packaging, as this was a humorous gift for my brother. I haven&#x27;t asked him how the product worked, but I presume that it is of great quality.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells really good and works great!  I wish it was cheaper but I don&#x27;t feel like I spent too much on it honestly.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is my first time growing a full beard. And this stuff has made my new growth both soft and Oh so manageable. I love it...</li>
    <li> I like the smell, first beard oil I have ever used. Smells very rich with rosemary which is nice. There seems to be enough in this bottle to last a few months if using 4-5 drops a day. Great product. Only gripe I have is the dropper system, you have to shake the bottle very fiercely to get anything out. Overall very happy with this beard oil.</li>
    <li> Controls and manages beard. Keeps it from being all dried out. Package arrived fast. Bottle is small, but a little is all you need. Smells nice, not too strong. Very good</li>
    <li> This beard conditioner worked wonders for my beard. I have learned that it helps more so if you are starting fresh with a beard.</li>
    <li> Snake oil in a bottle.  I was not pleased with the procduct.  I had requested to return and was refused.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this conditioner. And it doesnt smell horrible. it smells a little like sandal wood oil. My hubby has a long beard and it looks nice when he puts this stuff in it.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. It has softened my beard considerably.It is a very strong musk scent but wears off after a few minutes so its not so overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Leaves beard a little too greasy, but overall works well</li>
    <li> I am not certain how well this will work to preserve my beard and keep it from breaking. I only started growing it November 1. I can say that my wife comments on how soft my beard feels. I love the scent of this oil and use 2-4 drops after showering and drying my beard. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it doesn&#x27;t really help my beard hairs lay down. It&#x27;s still somewhat scruffy looking.</li>
    <li> It does a great job conditioning the beard, and it has a good smell that&#x27;s not perfume like. More like Mountain Man Pine.</li>
    <li> Liked this product, may just need something a bit stronger, have a very pointy mustache, it did soften a bit.</li>
    <li> A little hard to get out of the bottle</li>
    <li> I was worried that the smell would be overpowering (quite strong out of the bottle), but it fades when it is applied to the hair and skin fairly quickly. I have noticed that my beard is softer and growing thicker and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue, it comes out a bit irregularly.</li>
    <li> I found this randomly and thought I would get it for my husband to try out. He loves it! We have continued to use it as well as more products from this line.</li>
    <li> great price , all organic ingredients, nice smell, softens and conditions my beard as advertised. Probably the best beard oil for the price and ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been growing a beard for more than a decade now, but normally keep it trim enough where conditioning it isn&#x27;t an issue. This winter, however, I&#x27;ve decided to grow it out and see how that looks on me. After a bit of looking around and reading other reviews, I decided to give the Wild Man Beard Oil a shot. My wife thinks it smells great, which is always important, and it gives my beard a great feel and shine. My only complaint is that it is a bit tricky to get the oil out of the bottle and requires repeated tapping and shaking to get out enough for any beard over a half inch or so.</li>
    <li> The feel of Wild Man Beard Conditioning Oil is like chopping down a tree with an axe you built yourself and then killing a grizzly with your bear hands. I&#x27;ve never felt more manly in my life.</li>
    <li> I have a slight preference for the Honest Amish products, though Wild Man has a couple of advantages:&lt;br /&gt;The variety of scents they offer is nice.&lt;br /&gt;It survives temperature changes better than the &amp;#34;balms&amp;#34; from Honest Amish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have noted the difficulty getting the product out of the bottle.  I noticed the same, but now instead of shaking it over my palm, I tap it against my palm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it 0 stars. This stuff is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I got the beard care pack from my wife last Christmas, and have been using the oil religiously since. It smells great, not overpowering but a nice earthy-woodsy-manly scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly a year, i still have about a quarter of the bottle left. Other reviewers don&#x27;t like the bottle, but it&#x27;s great if you use it the way it was made. Hold it upside down for a few seconds without shaking it and a drop will start forming, after it drops a few more drops come quickly. 3-4 is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Raven bottle a couple days ago. I can&#x27;t comment on the scent, as I am yet to receive it, but the Original is great!</li>
    <li> Gives your beard a great shine and helps control the crazy beard hair. Smells good not over powering, but very settle.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s Christmas stocking. In 2013 he decided to grow a short-ish beard and we alway joked about how it holds the smells of everything he had eaten that day. This product has a strong, mountain-man smell. It doesn&#x27;t make his beard ultra shiny...but it has a nice smell.  Application is not super easy.  He tries to put it directly on his beard but that is too difficulty given the bottle.....so his hands will smell like the product as well.</li>
    <li> Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Drys out mny beard though.</li>
    <li> This beard oil is all natural and smells great! It&#x27;s a bit oily feeling when you&#x27;re putting it on, but does not stay oily on your beard. I tend to use a few times a week. My only problem with this product is that it&#x27;s very hard to get drops out of the bottle. Maybe I&#x27;m just being stupid, but I haven&#x27;t had much success shaking it sideways, at an angle or straight up and down to get that sweet, sweet oil out.</li>
    <li> Great product! Bought it as a gift for my husband. Love the way it smells, and it had made his beard super soft.</li>
    <li> I like the way this smells, feels and moisturizes my face fluff. Te only downside is the dispenser on the bottle. I understand to only use a small amount, but it&#x27;s fairly difficult to get a single drop at a time out of the bottle. Maybe a dropper would be better...</li>
    <li> This produce has a great manly odor, and I have no complaints with the results it produces, but the design on the cap makes it very difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> Smells like a forest and makes you feel like a lumber jack. I would apply it with cotton balls then brush it in with a fine comb or fine brush. Helped my beard look more full and darker. Lasts for the majority of the day. The down side is that when you touch your beasts the oil comes off on your fingers but it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal to me. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. It makes his beard soft and conditioned! Smells great too! Love that it is natural and easy to use. Cute packaging (but that is from a girl&#x27;s perspective).</li>
    <li> OK, day 2 of using Wild Man Conditioning Oil.  I like it.  My steel wool beard, almost down to nipple level, was dry and unruly.  No more.  I&#x27;ts now soft and less fly-away and rough.  Yes, it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle, but I think that&#x27;s a good thing.  A few drops go a long, long way.  I use 5-6 drops on each side of my beard, working it in and down to the beard end and that seems to be about right.  Lots of hair there.  Scent is pleasant and I, like other users, actually think it could be stronger.  My wife likes the scent, too.  I&#x27;ll order another bottle when it&#x27;s available on Amazon...  one for home and one for work.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas, he has been using it about 2 months now. He seems to like it, I love that kissing him is no longer like making out with a brillo pad.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a month or more. It smells really nice, but I&#x27;m not sure it really serves in purpose.</li>
    <li> Bit too wood smelling but still great.  My beard is huge and I use about 4 or 5 drops every third day or so.</li>
    <li> The smell is subtle, conditions nicely. I have not tried others but i enjoy this and so do the ladies</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift with conditioner wash and balm. Smells nice and woodsy not to strong and feels nice on my man beard.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of complaints about the bottle dispenser on here.  My solution was to purchase an amber bottle with a proper squeeze-tip, dropper dispenser from the pharmacy (about $5.00).  Then, using a small flat-head screwdriver or a butter knife, pry off the plastic dispenser from the WMBCO bottle (easy to do, but be careful not to spill the oil), and then steadily pour the oil into the new bottle (which can be reused).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only critique of the product, itself, is that the price should be lower, with more options on volume (I&#x27;d buy a bigger bottle for a lower price).</li>
