      <li>I love this makeup!</li>
      <li>I love this foundation, it covers nicely without smearing, and does not fade by the end of the day as some do.</li>
      <li>That is why I stuck with this foundation even after they discontinued the natural Ivory (which was the perfect match for my skin).</li>
      <li>Even my boyfriend tells me to keep using all the anti-aging stuff I&#x27;m using because it&#x27;s working :).  </li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t see spending a whole lot of money on makeup though, so this was a great value.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used clinique from belk which cost more but this one is better coverage and wears longer.</li>
      <li>(evens out my complexion and makes my light age spots unnoticeable).</li>
      <li>I found it again on Amazon and made sure to find the right shade-</li>
      <li>It is close enough in winter and a good match during summer months.</li>
      <li>This was purchased for my wife and is her absolute favorite brand.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and packaging was safe.</li>
      <li>After the founation dries, the smell quickly goes away.</li>
      <li>This goes on easy, does not look like makeup and seems to keep my skin looking healthy and younger.  </li>
      <li>I have bought this for the last year because it looks so natural even in bright light.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice any improvement in the look of my skin that would make it worth enduring this product.</li>
      <li>Provides good coverage and gives a little bit of a lift too.  </li>
      <li>The price was good, however when I received the product it looked used and messy.</li>
      <li>I sometimes buy a classic ivory and mix 2 parts creamy natural to 1 part classic ivory for a better look during winter months.</li>
      <li>Love this foundation as it glides on smoothly and it does conceal a few blemishes on my skin and it lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping....</li>
      <li>The coverage was average, certainly wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
      <li>I have found my new foundation</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never seen a new jar look like what I received.  </li>
      <li>Creamy Natural!  </li>
      <li>Decided to give this a try when Maybelline discontinued my favorite foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose it because it is the same color as the previous foundation</li>
      <li>I have the creamy natural.</li>
      <li>I now wear the creamy natural.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a few years now, and was happy to find it here for about $4 less than average drug store prices.</li>
      <li>It takes two or three rounds of soft soap and scrubbing that leaves my hands dry just to get the gunk off!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This was purchased for my wife and is her absolute favorite brand. She wouldn&#x27;t use anything else I don&#x27;t believe. Shipping was fast and packaging was safe. Great product.</li>
    <li> Decided to give this a try when Maybelline discontinued my favorite foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose it because it is the same color as the previous foundation and I thought it might help with lines, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took an instant dislike to the smell of the product. I despise the way the way the foundation feels. It feels greasy. It&#x27;s even hard to get off my hands after application. It takes two or three rounds of soft soap and scrubbing that leaves my hands dry just to get the gunk off! Plus, even hours later the foundation leaves greasy patches on my phone screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t notice any improvement in the look of my skin that would make it worth enduring this product. I would like to toss it out but hate wasting the $10 it cost me.</li>
    <li> I Truly like the make-up/foundation.  I purchased Age Rewind when i moved from the South to up North, After two weeks my skin turned pale, so i had to discontinue my usage.  I found it again on Amazon and made sure to find the right shade- Creamy Natural!  It does make your skin appear younger, but does not sting or have any abrasive contents.  It also lasts all day coverage, even with oily skin- yet the product itself is somewhat thinner.</li>
    <li> This makeup works great.  Provides good coverage and gives a little bit of a lift too.  I will continue to purchase this coverup.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the face, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, color matches as well.</li>
    <li> This makeup works well for me.  I am 50 and have been using it for about five years off and on.</li>
    <li> I gave this foundation 3 starts because it has an odor to it. Its not something i want to smell when applying. After the founation dries, the smell quickly goes away. The coverage was average, certainly wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation, it covers nicely without smearing, and does not fade by the end of the day as some do. I have been using it for a few years now, and was happy to find it here for about $4 less than average drug store prices.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup! I have bought this for the last year because it looks so natural even in bright light.</li>
    <li> I can not comment on the pros and cons of this Maybelline foundation make up because I will not put it on my face.  When I received this make up, it did not have any product purity protection on it and it appeared to contain less product than I felt it should.  It appears to me that this was either a sampler used in a store or a returned product.  Either way, I will not use a product that is pre-opened and may be contaminated by dirty fingers or God knows what.  I will not purchase from this company again because I had also purchased Noxzema cleansing cream at the same time I purchased this make up and  that appeared to be missing about  one third of the product and was lumpy and very odd looking.  I&#x27;ve used Noxzema cleansing cream for 40 years and I&#x27;ve never seen a new jar look like what I received.  I thought these product were new, but it appears that have been previously used.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping....excellent product</li>
    <li> Love this foundation as it glides on smoothly and it does conceal a few blemishes on my skin and it lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> I have started to order this online because it is difficult to find my shade in the stores at times. I think this is a great foundation. It gives good coverage. (evens out my complexion and makes my light age spots unnoticeable). The color does NOT settle into lines or wrinkles. I think I look younger with it on. That is why I stuck with this foundation even after they discontinued the natural Ivory (which was the perfect match for my skin). I now wear the creamy natural. It is close enough in winter and a good match during summer months. I sometimes buy a classic ivory and mix 2 parts creamy natural to 1 part classic ivory for a better look during winter months.</li>
    <li> I guess the fact that I&#x27;m a grandma and everyone can&#x27;t believe it speaks volumes as a recommendation.  Even my boyfriend tells me to keep using all the anti-aging stuff I&#x27;m using because it&#x27;s working :).  This goes on easy, does not look like makeup and seems to keep my skin looking healthy and younger.  I use this in combination with the Age Rewind powder.  I&#x27;ve tried other anti-aging foundations and they just don&#x27;t go on as well and don&#x27;t give my skin that extra zing.</li>
    <li> Not the best makeup I&#x27;ve ever used, it&#x27;s a little thick.  I can&#x27;t see spending a whole lot of money on makeup though, so this was a great value.</li>
    <li> Love this it&#x27;s cheaper here than stores</li>
    <li> I love this roll on makeup/eye under cover works great!!</li>
    <li> I have the creamy natural. It is the perfect shade, goes on smooth, and makes my skin look Flawless. Totally recommended. I have found my new foundation I hope they do not stop making it.</li>
    <li> The price was good, however when I received the product it looked used and messy. Also, the color was A LOT darker in person, so dark I can not use it!</li>
    <li> I like this make up because it covers small flaws, but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
    <li> Best makeup. I&#x27;ve used clinique from belk which cost more but this one is better coverage and wears longer.</li>
