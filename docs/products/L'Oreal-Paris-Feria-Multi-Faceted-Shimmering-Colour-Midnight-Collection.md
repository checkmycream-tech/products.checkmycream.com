### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and it came out wonderful without having to lighten it.</li>
      <li>Beautiful shade though!</li>
      <li>Amazing!!</li>
      <li>In the sun it&#x27;s a brilliant violet and inside its a darker violet.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased!</li>
      <li>I am kinda happy it didn&#x27;t come out as purple as the box.</li>
      <li>When I dyed my hair with this color it came out very nice.</li>
      <li>The scent was almost pleasant.</li>
      <li>Feria is always a good brand.</li>
      <li>Good product, arrived in time</li>
      <li>There was no sting or burning, so that&#x27;s also a good thing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>lot of Feria hair colors are the kind that take a gauntlet in the salon to achieve, but they offer these shades in a one-box solution that doesn&#x27;t always work they way a hopeful person would expect.</li>
      <li>Anytime you go with an unusual shade of color, its best to let it soak.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really nice color.</li>
      <li>When I saw Feria now makes a violet shade, I was thrilled, as out of all the brands I have tried over the years</li>
      <li>It worked liked a charm in covering it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s incredibly vibrant and so beautiful!</li>
      <li>/&gt;In conclusion, the colors are worth trying because they&#x27;re so beautiful on the box.</li>
      <li>The color is definitely suitable for work</li>
      <li>Love, love, love!</li>
      <li>The Feria line of hair colors are very beautiful and unique, but the developing creme seems to be a bit weak so the colors probably work the best on fair heads or on hair that dyes easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although color fades fast it is a gorgeous color!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s in my monthly delivery cycle now :)</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how much better it&#x27;d look over lightened hair.</li>
      <li>love the results of this dye and will use it again and again.  </li>
      <li>It fades over time, so be sure to use color safe products for maximum protection for your color.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Plus, I love that they come with an aromatic oil</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this color.</li>
      <li>A shimmery healthy looking brown but def not violet or purple in any way.</li>
      <li>I checked all packaging codes to make sure everything was correct, which it was, so I was hoping that it would darken/develop into the violet shade it claimed to be as it was processing.</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>This won&#x27;t work too well on virgin hair, but will make fried hair shinier and seem healthy because of the coating action.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the foam</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>All in all I would say this came out lovely.</li>
      <li>Seeking to mix it up, this deep violet shade seemed perfect.</li>
      <li>I find the quality of color to be exceptional for box and the color swatches are almost always right on the mark.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of grey but in my case it has a wonderful affect on how a color shimmers in my hair.</li>
      <li>The dye itself mixes up to be a very bright red</li>
      <li>Before I found it in a store, I figured that it would probably be more burgandy than purple and seeing the box, that assumption was confirmed.</li>
      <li>Enjoy this dye, it&#x27;s beautiful and won&#x27;t leave you dissapointed if your looking for something unique and vibrant..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and easy to do.</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful bright, vivid candy-apple red though.</li>
      <li>It is beautiful purple color especially under the light.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>Overall great product.</li>
      <li>I attached a bleached photo, an indoor light and outdoor light</li>
      <li>Photo #1 is the hair colour in indoor/artificial light,</li>
      <li>The color is great if you are after candy-apple red.  </li>
      <li>and WOW I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
      <li>As many other reviewers have noted, the bright PURPLE that Feria shows in their commercials and advertising is deceiving.</li>
      <li>I was going to look like Ronald MacDonald – it was that bright red.</li>
      <li>and I can say I&#x27;ve been able to see a real violet highlight, even in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Do NOT get this colour if you want a true violet/purple shade, you will NOT achieve it with this dye.  </li>
      <li>I love this dye so so much.</li>
      <li>For the most part, the Feria line is pretty good, especially if you know how to color-lift your own hair prior to dyeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does seem to wash out and fade rather quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It shipped quickly with Prime which was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A little darker than I was looking for but a beautiful color that lasts.</li>
      <li>scent/smell is very gentle considering that most hair dyes can be very noxious.</li>
      <li>I love this new color, just wish it stayed violet longer..</li>
      <li>Maybe the darker parts of my (brown) hair would look burgandy but the streaks would be purple and that would look cool, right?</li>
      <li>color comes out more vividly on lighter hair.</li>
      <li>It looked pretty cool, but when I got the reviews, I got a bit nervous.</li>
      <li>Right out of the box as I started to mix it</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply and it didn&#x27;t take no where near the time to rinse out.</li>
      <li>This seems like bait and switch to me with the commercial obviously having been greatly &amp;#34;enhanced.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>especially if you have lighter hair. :)</li>
      <li>I will be using it again soon and hoping the second time around yields a better color for what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought 2 more boxes for the future.</li>
      <li>Fell out after the FIRST wash leaving me with splotchy color all over.</li>
      <li>reality is that it is really more of a deep read color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s purple with red hues, and looks stunning.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I was covering up a crappy dye job from a color called London Lilac by vidal sasson.</li>
      <li>, the Feria brand is the most jewel-like and longest lasting at home hair dye I have used.</li>
      <li>and although it is a pretty pretty color it is most definitely RED.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s probably because her hair was most likely bleached before.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a deep, bright red which keeps me out of trouble at work and out on the sun, or brightly lot places, it&#x27;s purple.</li>
      <li>you look at the actual box, the color they show in the before and after panel is much more accurate than what is shown in the commercial.</li>
      <li>instructions are super easy to follow, and the box comes with everything you will need to color your hair minus any combs/</li>
      <li>/&gt;Professionally, a colorist will pick the right developing creme for the type of color you are trying to achieve (along with many other decisions based on chemistry and expertise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is slightly more dry than it was</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a permanent dye, but still gives me the edgy, chic, colorful look I love!</li>
      <li>With any red dye it does tend to lose its robust color after a few washes but overall I think its great!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve notice that the color does not fade as much.</li>
      <li>I avoid washing dyed hair very often.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s purple, but not so much that it&#x27;s unprofessional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The dye was a bit more runny than other hair dye&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Although this one turned out a little more red and a little less violet in most lighting, the color quality is beautiful as always.</li>
      <li>to the wise, if you have slightly resistant hair leave on an extra 10-15 minutes, it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>More of a dark pink/magenta then violet, but I do like the way the color comes out.</li>
      <li>I really saturated my hair with the dye and let it sit a few minutes past what was directed, and wow, it has turned out so beautifully!</li>
      <li>I was wanting a color that was a bit more fun without being too edgy and I like the violet highlights they showed on the commercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Second time around I dyed over a mix of my natural color of light brown, and faded Power Violet.</li>
      <li>it is very pretty HOWEVER, I am used to having my hair PURPLE or a deep violet</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a very stubborn but handy person, you can learn how to make the proper results happen with a little bit of research.ou&#x27;re</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing!! I have really dark hair and it came out wonderful without having to lighten it. I can&#x27;t imagine how much better it&#x27;d look over lightened hair. Obviously it&#x27;s not as purple as the box picture but that&#x27;s probably because her hair was most likely bleached before. Bought 2 more boxes for the future. I love it!</li>
    <li> More of a dark pink/magenta then violet, but I do like the way the color comes out. My hair is naturally a dark mocha, and has been dyed/lightened regularly. It does seem to wash out and fade rather quickly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color. It&#x27;s a deep, bright red which keeps me out of trouble at work and out on the sun, or brightly lot places, it&#x27;s purple. Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> I love this new color, just wish it stayed violet longer..it tends to fade to red, at least for me.  Beautiful shade though!</li>
    <li> Basically deep red on my medium brown hair. No way it&#x27;s the vivid violet shown in the commercials.</li>
    <li> Good product, arrived in time</li>
    <li> My box of dye came a little beat up, the top flap was off so the contents of the dye box had all fallen out into the box, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal really. None if the components of the dye were messed up at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shipped quickly with Prime which was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the dye itself...&lt;br /&gt;5/5! I love this dye so so much. It&#x27;s a permanent dye, but still gives me the edgy, chic, colorful look I love! It&#x27;s purple with red hues, and looks stunning. I receive lots of compliments on the color. I&#x27;ve used this color twice now. The first time I used it I was covering up a crappy dye job from a color called London Lilac by vidal sasson. That color was hardly purple at all, unfortunately. It worked liked a charm in covering it. It was a little darker than what I expected, but considering I was going from dark to light I wasn&#x27;t surprised.  Second time around I dyed over a mix of my natural color of light brown, and faded Power Violet. I really saturated my hair with the dye and let it sit a few minutes past what was directed, and wow, it has turned out so beautifully! It looks salon done. It&#x27;s incredibly vibrant and so beautiful! It&#x27;s purple, but not so much that it&#x27;s unprofessional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the results of this dye and will use it again and again.  It fades over time, so be sure to use color safe products for maximum protection for your color. My color stayed vibrant for 3 months or so last time I dyed. I think using a chlorine pool a few times a week may have played a part in causing the color to become dull prematurely. Enjoy this dye, it&#x27;s beautiful and won&#x27;t leave you dissapointed if your looking for something unique and vibrant.. especially if you have lighter hair. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got my after photos in the sun so you can see it.  And what it looks like when you are coloring it.</li>
    <li> A little darker than I was looking for but a beautiful color that lasts.</li>
    <li> I bleached my medium brown hair to a pale blonde, with some orange prior to use. (the orange may account for the color variation)  The dye was a bit more runny than other hair dye&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past.  A towel around your shoulders is a must.  The color is great if you are after candy-apple red.  I definitely would not call it violet.  It is a beautiful bright, vivid candy-apple red though. I attached a bleached photo, an indoor light and outdoor light so you can see the color difference.  My hair is slightly more dry than it was but that I&#x27;m sure is due to the double processing.</li>
    <li> I love Feria, but this colour was completely disappointing. I had been using Vidal Sassoon London Lilac and Deep Velvet Violet shades (not at the same time, one or the other whenever I was able to find them in the stores), which do give you a truly blue (cool) toned purplish/violet black colour. When I saw Feria now makes a violet shade, I was thrilled, as out of all the brands I have tried over the years, the Feria brand is the most jewel-like and longest lasting at home hair dye I have used. Right out of the box as I started to mix it I knew I was in trouble. The dye mixed up to a neon magenta/fuscia. I checked all packaging codes to make sure everything was correct, which it was, so I was hoping that it would darken/develop into the violet shade it claimed to be as it was processing. After applying and waiting the amount of time recommended on the directions, I wanted to cry, as I was convinced once I washed it out I was going to look like Ronald MacDonald – it was that bright red. I mean Rocky Horror MAGENTA, it did not develop at all into a darker, violet colour. After washing it out 3 times and conditioning, then styling my hair, I was relieved to see that the colour had darkened. However, the colour was a dark red/brown, and after a couple weeks of regular washings, it has lightened to a medium shade of vibrant red-brown. I get compliments on the colour – the RED colour, but I hate that it is not at all what was advertised or what I wanted and was expecting. I am now waiting very impatiently to re-dye my hair. I plan on doing some damage control by switching over to a Korean bubble dye that is a pinky brown, as I’m halfway to that shade already. Do NOT get this colour if you want a true violet/purple shade, you will NOT achieve it with this dye.  Photo #1 is the hair colour in indoor/artificial light, photo #2 is in natural outdoor lighting, and a lot closer to how the shade looks to the naked eye.</li>
    <li> I used to use L&#x27;Oreal Feria Ruby Rush(I think that&#x27;s what it was called they changed the name a couple of times)and then the foaming hair colors came out and I moved away from Feria to a different brand as close to that color as I could get. I love the foam it&#x27;s easy to apply and it didn&#x27;t take no where near the time to rinse out. When it came time to dye my hair again I saw this and kept going back and forth as to whether I wanted to go back to this type of dye solution. I said what the heck I&#x27;ll give it a try and WOW I&#x27;m so glad I did! I love, love, love this color. I have a lot of grey but in my case it has a wonderful affect on how a color shimmers in my hair. In the sun it&#x27;s a brilliant violet and inside its a darker violet. I am hooked on this color and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I like this color it is very pretty HOWEVER, I am used to having my hair PURPLE or a deep violet and although it is a pretty pretty color it is most definitely RED.</li>
    <li> I love this color. Inside under fluorescent lights it is Burgandy/Dark Alburn. Under Direct sunlight my head is freaking Purple.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it is like this for everyone but I am in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also maybe slightly less professional then I need to be in the work place.</li>
    <li> Although color fades fast it is a gorgeous color! I have been using the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free shampoo and conditioner and I&#x27;ve notice that the color does not fade as much. Combine this with washing your hair 2-3 times a week with cold water and you can get this color to stay longer.</li>
    <li> Well this is lame. I have used Feria since it was launched some 20ish years ago. A few trials of other brands interspersed but I always come back to Feria. Usually I use the chocolate cherry shade and it&#x27;s lovely. Seeking to mix it up, this deep violet shade seemed perfect. But it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s brown. A shimmery healthy looking brown but def not violet or purple in any way. I&#x27;m so sad. Blaaaaaah.</li>
    <li> My medium to dark brown hair came out exactly the color on the box.  It is beautiful purple color especially under the light.  I am waiting to see how the color holds since I only dyed it 3 days ago.  I use WEN cleansing cream which helps your color to stay longer.  Will definitely do this again.</li>
    <li> Before I used this dye my hair was a reddish orange. When I dyed my hair with this color it came out very nice. It is still purple but it is much darker than the box and it left and purplish red throughout my hair. It&#x27;s a really nice color. I am kinda happy it didn&#x27;t come out as purple as the box.</li>
    <li> As many other reviewers have noted, the bright PURPLE that Feria shows in their commercials and advertising is deceiving. Although I don&#x27;t normally use box dyes anymore, I picked up one to test it out. Before I found it in a store, I figured that it would probably be more burgandy than purple and seeing the box, that assumption was confirmed. The packaging says &amp;#34;violet&amp;#34; everywhere but the model has burgandy hair, no purple at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some white blonde streaks bleached into my hair, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a go and see what happens. Maybe the darker parts of my (brown) hair would look burgandy but the streaks would be purple and that would look cool, right? Wrong. The dye itself mixes up to be a very bright red and when you add the purple &amp;#34;power booster&amp;#34; included in the package it turns fuschia. I thought &amp;#34;well hot pink might be interesting!&amp;#34; and went for it. In the end, my hair is the same burgandy color as everyone else in the customer photos - no purple at all. The blonde parts of my hair just grabbed the pink even stronger so it&#x27;s just two tones lighter than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the future, I&#x27;ll stick to my blue-black dye (from an actual beauty supply) with a temporary purple mixed in -- that actually gets me the results that are shown in the Feria ads.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve dyed my hair and my hair is naturally black so I was worried the color would barely be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news: My hair was dyed and it was visibly noticeable in both indoor lighting as well as outdoor. The color is definitely suitable for work so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair color potentially getting me in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad news: The hair color is more of a dark red shade instead of the vibrant purple I was looking for. If I squint at my hair in the sun, it vaguely resembles purple but it isn&#x27;t a pronounced purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair itself feels slightly drier than normal after dying it but it isn&#x27;t that bad as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as an FYI, get shampoo that do not have sulfates in order to prolong the color of your newly dyed hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim from our local Walmart. It looked pretty cool, but when I got the reviews, I got a bit nervous. I decided to go for it anyway and I LOVE it! I haven&#x27;t stained anything and I dyed it maybe a week ago. (Minus the towels I had kept for dying hair anyway, so they were already messy. I also use those to wrap my hair up after I shower and actually wash it.) I avoid washing dyed hair very often.</li>
    <li> Made my hair VERY DARK almost black. Misrepresents what the color will be. And it dried my hair out to boot.</li>
    <li> (Justins wife)&lt;br /&gt;This color &amp;#34;vixen violet&amp;#34; is a &amp;#34;power violet&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This color has not a single hint of violet once finished. It dyed my roots a red/brown and my ends remained the same with a very very slight tint of copper. This is NOT true to its color. I have used many different brands of red and violet dyes and have never had such a disappointment as this one.</li>
    <li> 1. It is NOT violet or any shade remotely resembling violet.  This is a RED color.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Fell out after the FIRST wash leaving me with splotchy color all over.</li>
    <li> I love the color. Not quite burgundy not quite red. Feria is always a good brand. It comes with a color booster to help brighten it.&lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise, if you have slightly resistant hair leave on an extra 10-15 minutes, it doesn&#x27;t hurt. Anytime you go with an unusual shade of color, its best to let it soak. Took about 3weeks before I noticed the fade starting. Overall great product. It&#x27;s in my monthly delivery cycle now :)</li>
    <li> I have no idea why this haircolor keeps washing out. It shows up on my clothes, in my bath, bed everywhere after a week. The stains are getting fainter, but the dye is still coming out after 5 shampoos (the 2 they suggest at the start, then one every other day). I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with other Feria colors before, but this is unusual.  Update: Then I tried the Vidal Sassoon brand and found the same thing happened--dye in the bath and on clothes after two weeks, and the color was gone after three weeks. This never happens to my hair with permanent dyes. I guess the crack teams at these places still can&#x27;t figure out the color purple...</li>
    <li> The color works well on the roots but not on the ends. This won&#x27;t work too well on virgin hair, but will make fried hair shinier and seem healthy because of the coating action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color comes out more vividly on lighter hair. The color doesn&#x27;t develop uniformly so it won&#x27;t match the swatch image on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are super easy to follow, and the box comes with everything you will need to color your hair minus any combs/clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent/smell is very gentle considering that most hair dyes can be very noxious. The scent was almost pleasant. There was no sting or burning, so that&#x27;s also a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the developing creme is #20, but I&#x27;m not sure. The Feria line of hair colors are very beautiful and unique, but the developing creme seems to be a bit weak so the colors probably work the best on fair heads or on hair that dyes easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a manufacturing perspective, it seems like they use the same developing creme all across the board for all of their shades, regardless of the color desired. That&#x27;s why salons charge so much for a proper coloring job. The same developing creme won&#x27;t always work for all colors because the results depend on the hair quality/integrity/condition/texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professionally, a colorist will pick the right developing creme for the type of color you are trying to achieve (along with many other decisions based on chemistry and expertise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of Feria hair colors are the kind that take a gauntlet in the salon to achieve, but they offer these shades in a one-box solution that doesn&#x27;t always work they way a hopeful person would expect. For the most part, the Feria line is pretty good, especially if you know how to color-lift your own hair prior to dyeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the colors are worth trying because they&#x27;re so beautiful on the box. The formula is gentle enough for experimentation. It&#x27;s inexpensive and easy to do. Results will vary. If you&#x27;re a very stubborn but handy person, you can learn how to make the proper results happen with a little bit of research.ou&#x27;re a very stubborn but handy person, you can learn how to make the proper results happen with a little bit of research.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now and everyone compliments it! With any red dye it does tend to lose its robust color after a few washes but overall I think its great! I used two boxes because of the length and thickness of my hair, the pictures are taken immediately after I dyed and rinsed my hair</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the TV commercial you also might have seen. I was wanting a color that was a bit more fun without being too edgy and I like the violet highlights they showed on the commercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reality is that it is really more of a deep read color and I can say I&#x27;ve been able to see a real violet highlight, even in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I do like the dark red color... it&#x27;s just not what I was hoping for.  I will be using it again soon and hoping the second time around yields a better color for what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look at the actual box, the color they show in the before and after panel is much more accurate than what is shown in the commercial. This seems like bait and switch to me with the commercial obviously having been greatly &amp;#34;enhanced.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I almost exclusively use Feria color when I use box colors on my hair. I find the quality of color to be exceptional for box and the color swatches are almost always right on the mark. Plus, I love that they come with an aromatic oil so the chemical scent isn&#x27;t so obvious. Although this one turned out a little more red and a little less violet in most lighting, the color quality is beautiful as always. I will say that the color boost tube you have to add to the developer seemed to make the mixture more watery than usual and therefore application was a bit messier. I definitely suggest applying some Vaseline to your hairline and ears and neck, as the mixture is VERY vibrant. All in all I would say this came out lovely. I am very pleased!</li>
