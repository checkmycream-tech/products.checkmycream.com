      <li>I think that the picture represents it accurately.</li>
      <li>These Nail Polish are genial, the colors are great and it stays for long.</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful color (like sunflower yellow), but it is very transparent.  </li>
      <li>This is also a good color to use with navy blue for WVU colors</li>
      <li>Very pretty color.</li>
      <li>I have some yellow tones in my skin color and it  blends nicely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a taxi yellow, and it&#x27;s very cheerful and fun for summer.</li>
      <li>In-between a yellow and gold - it has a soft, but bright look</li>
      <li>Looked very pretty and different than just a bright yellow!</li>
      <li>Color was exactly as pictured.  </li>
      <li>I guess I need more patience for yellow polish!</li>
      <li>They are real OPI.</li>
      <li>The product came fast and was just as described.</li>
      <li>I have had success with opacity in two coats and have no trouble with the formula in general.</li>
      <li>Like this color, but it needs several coats to get that true yellow.</li>
      <li>I wanted this color in particular for a mustard yellow look.</li>
      <li>I tried 3 coats and had trouble waiting long enough for it to harden completely with a top coat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for this particular yellow for a while: darker yellow but not a green or orange-toned yellow.</li>
      <li>issue is that the color does not really match the pure yellow in the pic - in reality</li>
      <li>Very hard to get a solid color out of it without any of the nail beneath showing, and looks more yellow than the pictures.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s Opi. What else to say. Looks good, beautiful color, lasts long.</li>
    <li> The perfect Yellow. I&#x27;m going to love it this summer...</li>
    <li> I love the color. It&#x27;s like a taxi yellow, and it&#x27;s very cheerful and fun for summer. I think that the picture represents it accurately. I find that it does NOT cover well. I use a lot of OPI polish and this one is thinner in consistency and after 2 coats it was still patchy. I tried 3 coats and had trouble waiting long enough for it to harden completely with a top coat. I guess I need more patience for yellow polish!</li>
    <li> This is one of my fav fingernail polish by OPI! I think it&#x27;s a great color for any skin tone and I receieved it in great timing! :)</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this polish and it is a high quality polish! Sincerely, Mary Beth K.</li>
    <li> This color is so beautiful is the best yellow polish I have ever used. It didn&#x27;t stain my nails either, usually all yellow colors stain, but this one did not. It arrived on time and packaged very carefully. Defiantly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Color was exactly as pictured.  Would probably look best with three coats but two worked.&lt;br /&gt;Great match for sports teams.</li>
    <li> not the color as shown.  is a lot duller in color.</li>
    <li> As all OPI polishes, great quality, stays about 5 days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is that the color does not really match the pure yellow in the pic - in reality, it&#x27;s a sort of dirty yellow. Does not look good on pale fingers at all :(</li>
    <li> I wanted this color in particular for a mustard yellow look.

    <li> Good color.  Cannot go wrong with OPI, but it is yellow</li>
    <li> These Nail Polish are genial, the colors are great and it stays for long. The product arrived on time and perfect.</li>
    <li> Very hard to get a solid color out of it without any of the nail beneath showing, and looks more yellow than the pictures.</li>
    <li> I love this color. I order a lot of OPI nail polish online. The product came fast and was just as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this particular yellow for a while: darker yellow but not a green or orange-toned yellow. It is beautiful and the formula is great. Fantastic fall color!</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous color. I have had success with opacity in two coats and have no trouble with the formula in general. If you are looking for yellow polish, this one is it.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color. It is a bit darker than the picture. I have noticed that if you pull up a color for OPI or China Glaze you will get the same color name but the shades are different.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this color when I first saw it, but it looks great on. I have some yellow tones in my skin color and it  blends nicely. In-between a yellow and gold - it has a soft, but bright look that&#x27;s perfect for summer.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews that said these were fake. The polish was just as described and exceeded my expectations. They are real OPI.</li>
    <li> This is an amazeing color for fall its not to yellow so that you look like big bird. It really a great fall color.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color (like sunflower yellow), but it is very transparent.  It requires three coats to reach opaque consistency.  Maybe a layer of white underneath would help it stand out.</li>
