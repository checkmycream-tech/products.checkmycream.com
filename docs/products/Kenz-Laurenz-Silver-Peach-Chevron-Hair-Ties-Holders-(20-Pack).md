      <li>Very strong chemical smell.</li>
      <li>They also had a very strong smell that I could not remove.</li>
      <li>These hair ties are really cute, however I have some problems with them.</li>
      <li>and they look cute on your wrist.</li>
      <li>I will purchase this brand again when I need more hair ties.</li>
      <li>They do stretch out like most hair ties</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably get more at some point</li>
      <li>These were ok.</li>
      <li>Cute colors and designs, work well.</li>
      <li>I love these colors and the style of these hair ties.</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>and they should smell fine :)</li>
      <li>Great soft hair ties that don&#x27;t leave any creases.  </li>
      <li>They came with an incredibly strong odor.</li>
      <li>and they were fine after that.</li>
      <li>These are super cute in design and work well to hold hair in a ponytail without making a huge crease.</li>
      <li>Fortunately it just went away over time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought hair ties from Ann Taylor LOFT, Lucky Brand, and Goody.</li>
      <li>Never going back to the old kind!</li>

      <li>They shipped super fast.  </li>
      <li>These work well, protect my hair from ripping, and last for many uses before stretching out.</li>
      <li>Overall they&#x27;re adorable, but I&#x27;d probably recommend buying hair ties from another brand.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even have a strong sense of smell, but it&#x27;s definitely noticeable.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still trying to get through the whole pack.</li>
      <li>These look much prettier in the pictures.</li>
      <li>Very tasteful color and sheen in person.</li>
      <li>Like some of the other costumers mentioned, they smell pretty strongly of chemicals.</li>
      <li>The colors are a little different than they appear in the picture...not too thrilled about that</li>
      <li>They work well so far!</li>
      <li>None of them stretched enough to actually fit my hair.</li>
      <li>These are so much nicer to keep on my wrist to pull my hair back while I&#x27;m working or to wear going out.</li>
      <li>These a comparable as far as quality and elasticity.</li>
      <li>but I expected them to be bigger with more of a visual effect  </li>
      <li>so if anyone has super thick or curly hair these might not hold all of it.</li>

<li> Just wash them in the washing machine with cold water, laundry detergent and some white vinegar.  </li>
<li> The downside,  as others have previously stated,  is that they smell awful when first opened.</li>
<li> They were all too small!</li>
<li> although not as bad.</li>

    <li> It gets loosen really soon after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Cute colors and designs, work well. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> These hair ties are really cute, however I have some problems with them. For one thing, they are pretty small so if anyone has super thick or curly hair these might not hold all of it. Like some of the other costumers mentioned, they smell pretty strongly of chemicals. I don&#x27;t even have a strong sense of smell, but it&#x27;s definitely noticeable. I soaked them in the sink with detergent for a few minutes and dried them out and they were fine after that. Overall they&#x27;re adorable, but I&#x27;d probably recommend buying hair ties from another brand.</li>
    <li> I soaked these for days before I was going to put them in my hair... In which I  never did bc of the chemical smell that never dissipated. Never again. I&#x27;ll go to Walgreens!</li>
    <li> Great soft hair ties that don&#x27;t leave any creases.  I will continue to use only these!</li>
    <li> Good stuff if you chronically misplace your ponytail holders as I do.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected...keeps hair from breaking.</li>
    <li> These look much prettier in the pictures. The colors in person aren&#x27;t as pastel-looking. (I got the peach and silver ones.)</li>
    <li> These came as promised and work great! Purchased them months ago and I&#x27;m still trying to get through the whole pack.</li>
    <li> The ties had a harsh plastic smell to them when received. I washed them but the smell remained. Fortunately it just went away over time. They do stretch out like most hair ties but I think I like them enough to reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> Very cute, loved all the colors and patterns.  They did not seem as durable as other ribbon hair ties I have purchased, but time will tell.</li>
    <li> These are so much nicer to keep on my wrist to pull my hair back while I&#x27;m working or to wear going out. Very tasteful color and sheen in person. Mine did NOT have any odor as other reviewers have mentioned. Also I have very thick, wavy, long hair and these do stay in for quite a while, so no problems there either. I like that they don&#x27;t leave a crease and probably do much less damage to my hair than usual hair bands.</li>
    <li> They were all too small! None of them stretched enough to actually fit my hair. They also had a very strong smell that I could not remove.</li>
    <li> I ordered these ponytail holders for a child but gifted an adult with them because they were such lovely colors.  The pack exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I love these colors and the style of these hair ties. Never going back to the old kind!</li>
    <li> These smell realllly funky and it makes your hands smell if you touch them too. I don&#x27;t want my hair to smell like these I regret the purchase :/</li>
    <li> These are super cute in design and work well to hold hair in a ponytail without making a huge crease.</li>
    <li> Very nice colors and style but oh my goodness they stink!! Very strong chemical smell. I washed with Woolite but they still stink...although not as bad. I assume this will dissipate in time.</li>
    <li> Protect the hair well but I expected them to be bigger with more of a visual effect  Basically, they&#x27;re just elastic ponytail holders.</li>
    <li> Work great and super cute!</li>
    <li> I bought 2. both came in a great condition and was as described.</li>
    <li> These are great! Colors are what you expect from the picture. I&#x27;ve bought hair ties from Ann Taylor LOFT, Lucky Brand, and Goody. These a comparable as far as quality and elasticity. I will purchase this brand again when I need more hair ties.</li>
    <li> These work well, protect my hair from ripping, and last for many uses before stretching out.</li>
    <li> 20 were shipped, cute colors and perfect for my hair. I do have to agree that they do smell like moth balls though.</li>
    <li> The only hair ties for me.</li>
    <li> They shipped super fast.  The colors were great.  They were the perfect size and hold my hair well.  The downside,  as others have previously stated,  is that they smell awful when first opened. Just wash them in the washing machine with cold water, laundry detergent and some white vinegar.  Let them air out and they should smell fine :)</li>
    <li> Colors are not true to what is pictured.</li>
    <li> These were ok. They came with an incredibly strong odor. Similar to the foam stickers you can get at Michael&#x27;s (if that makes sense…sort of a gasoline or chemical smell). Ran them through the washing machine twice and they finally started to smell better.&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, they are very cute. They hold your hair alright and they look cute on your wrist. If the smell hadn&#x27;t started to fade after washing, I would have pitched them…but thats just me!</li>
    <li> They work well so far! The colors are a little different than they appear in the picture...not too thrilled about that but it&#x27;s not a huge deal. They smell kinda funky but I&#x27;m guessing that will go away with time. I&#x27;ll probably get more at some point</li>
