      <li>I love the color, too.</li>
      <li>I love the Aquis line of towels.</li>
      <li>Pittsburgh had better look out.  </li>
      <li>they should work for most people.</li>
      <li>Then I would have been able to easily tie it around my 33\\&quot; waist.</li>
      <li>Perfect for helping to dry my hair, and drying out the shower!</li>
      <li>and she said it was fine</li>
      <li>I have a 30in waist and the towel fit me fine.</li>
      <li>so he doesn&#x27;t lug around a huge towel.</li>
      <li>so I could get free shipping.</li>
      <li>I own one - it does my hair and my whole body......</li>
      <li>I got the large size and it is perfect for wrapping my long hair after a shower.</li>
      <li>Not a big deal for me, but a more accurate image would be nice.</li>
      <li>course this FIRST time then bring it with you when you visit again :)</li>
      <li>The towel is really light, compact and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>I took this towel on a sailing trip and it was great--much better than a large cotton terrycloth</li>
      <li>I love it so much i bought another one and both my kids.  </li>
      <li>So when I saw this product I though it would be a full body size.</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good things about this towel.</li>
      <li>Super absorbant, works better than my normal towels in terms of removing water off my skin and hair!  </li>
      <li>I assume this would be a tremendous item.</li>
      <li>Absorbent, quick drying microfiber towel and travels well to gym, pool or camping.</li>
      <li>Adequate size for the gym.</li>
      <li>We liked it so much that we purchased several more.</li>
      <li>This is a great backpacking towel, super-absorbent and large enough to actually dry off more than just parts of your body or gear.  </li>
      <li>This towel dries a person after showering and could be used again right away (according to my husband).</li>
      <li>These are perfect for the gym as they take up a lot less space than a regular cotton towel in your bag.</li>
      <li>This is great fr backpack traveling as it is full size but folds up small and dries fast.</li>
      <li>Not only is this product great for my annual treks to Big Bend, I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
      <li>The towels are not really comfortable but they are not awful either, they are rougher than a bath towel but work much better for traveling.  </li>
      <li>built in loop with a strong snap are a great bonus that let you attach it to rigging to dry without fear that the wind would blow it away (as it did with other people&#x27;s towels).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my first travel / microfiber / adventure / whatever towel..</li>
      <li>but I have no future plans to invest any more money unless the price drops</li>
      <li>However, it matches my bathroom and sucks up water great.  </li>
      <li>little loop was perfect to hang dry it without worrying about it blowing or falling off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually contemplating buying the size XL and cut it down to my meassurements - it&#x27;s that good!</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve tried washing with bleach and other nice smelling detergents, but i can&#x27;t get rid of the smell and wound up tossing it.  </li>
      <li>worth noting is that this particular towel is not the same&lt;br /&gt;superfuzzy</li>
      <li>Great for vacations to the tropics, where cotton&lt;br /&gt;can take a long time to dry.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super quick and very absorbent, and quick to dry too.</li>
      <li>but it worked perfectly and folded up small and flat into its pouch to fit back in my backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll lay it out to dry in my trunk most of the time after I use it and then wash it after about 5-6 uses but the smell still builds up.</li>
      <li>They dry me off OK</li>
      <li>teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>And at half to one-third the price of much smaller \\&quot;backpacker&#x27;s\\&quot; microfiber towels, it&#x27;s a great value too.  </li>
      <li>actual fabric is fine, about what you&#x27;d expect for a travel towel -- not plush but it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>The towel was great for drying off and took up little space in the back pack.</li>
      <li>It works very well for drying hair also.</li>
      <li>Absorbs Fast as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me of a shammy except its cloth.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would rather use a real towel, but this one serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
      <li>Even after its very wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swim 4-5 times a week and this saves me so much time.  </li>
      <li>each - guess those colors don&#x27;t move very well.</li>
      <li>Very absorbant, and durable microfiber towel.  </li>
      <li>I just think the whole towel would benefit from adding 2 inches in each direction.</li>
      <li>lukewarm whole milk (90 to 100 degrees)&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;¼ pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted,&lt;br /&gt;plus extra for the</li>
      <li>This towel was very absorbent.</li>
      <li>Originally purchased two large towels last year.</li>
      <li>Oh, and the nylon part of the stuff sacks nearly fell apart after the first use.</li>
      <li>Had the beige waffle Aquis but showed up the washed off hair color every time I&#x27;d wash my hair till I discovered they had the dark gray which is a much better choice for colored hair.</li>
      <li>Normally, I don&#x27;t ask for too much in a towel, and I&#x27;m not concerned about softness.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Despite it&#x27;s smallish size, it absorbs effectively (more than enough to dry you completely), then dries itself quickly so you can use it again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>We have used high performance synthetic camping towels for 8 years.</li>
      <li>and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM.</li>
      <li>brought two towels, this one for drying off after ocean swimming, and an even smaller Aquis one for drying off after fresh water showers.</li>
      <li>The towel is a nice size and comfortable still wraps around my waist but folds down to a small size.</li>
      <li>i was a bit weary that this smallish towel would be able to dry me well enough . . .</li>
      <li>Good size, not as soft as my small white one</li>

    <li> I got a white one for christmas.  I love it so much i bought another one and both my kids.  it&#x27;s perfect for my head.  Not so bulky and heavy like a regular towel. It does dry my hair really quick.</li>
    <li> The towel was great for drying off and took up little space in the back pack. It dried quickly, even in the humidity of El Salvador.</li>
    <li> Very absorbant, and durable microfiber towel.  More like a towel, less like a chamois that you wipe your car down with.</li>
    <li> Absorbent, quick drying microfiber towel and travels well to gym, pool or camping. Wonderful for drying your hair and body. This color selection is very nice. I have a few of these in white and yellow from marshall&#x27;s spa clearance area for 4 to 6 bucks each - guess those colors don&#x27;t move very well. I grab them every time I see them to have for houseguest amenity baskets. I&#x27;m always asked if they can have the Aquis Towel. \\&quot;Of course this FIRST time then bring it with you when you visit again :)\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also great for drying cars after washing. I keep one in my car trunk.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Super absorbant, works better than my normal towels in terms of removing water off my skin and hair!  It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue at all.  I only wish it were bigger.</li>
    <li> Not only is this product great for my annual treks to Big Bend, I use it every time I wash my hair. It is light, super absorbent, and is thin enough to wrap my hair up without feeling like I have the Cheshire cat sleeping on my head. Great value.</li>
    <li> This towel will dry your skin off on the first pass. Some other pack towels I&#x27;ve seen and normal towels take one or two passes to dry your skin. Aquis sucks the water right off you in one pass. Even after its very wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swim 4-5 times a week and this saves me so much time.  Its big enough to wrap around me for deck changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no trouble in the wash or dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very light when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sand does not \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to it.  I used this at the beach and went to dust it off and the sand had already fallen off. one or two wackes and all the sand was off it.  I mean all the sand hardly a single grain.</li>
    <li> I have a 30in waist and the towel fit me fine. If you are a big guy you should prob. get the XL</li>
    <li> I like cotton a lot.  I&#x27;m not ready for microfiber underwear.&lt;br /&gt;But these towels are ideal for traveling - they&#x27;re lightweight&lt;br /&gt;and dry quickly.  Great for vacations to the tropics, where cotton&lt;br /&gt;can take a long time to dry.  Pool owners will also find them valuable.&lt;br /&gt;Also worth noting is that this particular towel is not the same&lt;br /&gt;superfuzzy weave you may be used to from the smaller microfiber towels&lt;br /&gt;(including Aquis&#x27;s) that have become more common of late.  Believe it or not, it feels something like suede.  Thanks Aquis and Amazon for a great advance in towelage.</li>
    <li> Disappointed, I bought several body shammies in years past that are a true microfiber, this is just a very thin cheap towel</li>
    <li> This is my first travel / microfiber / adventure / whatever towel..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is NOT a regular towel, it does get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the medium sized one. It is a little smaller than a normal bath towel, but it is easily sufficient to dry yourself with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather use a real towel, but this one serves it&#x27;s purpose. It&#x27;s compact and it gets me dry.</li>
    <li> I love the Aquis line of towels. I use the microfiber hair towel every day. So when I saw this product I though it would be a full body size. It was my error not to get out a tape measure and see that this towel is about the same size as my hair towel. I guess when I read \\&quot;large\\&quot; and \\&quot;adventure\\&quot; towel I thought it would be large enough for my fianc&amp;eacute; to use at the gym. It isn&#x27;t nearly big enough for that but it still is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have seen my wife and sister use Aquis Microfiber towels for years. Their specific use tends to be as a head wrap following a hair wash - presumably reducing the time it takes to dry their hair when they are ready. These incredibly thirsty towels are good for so much more than that. Not to get too personal, but I have all but ceased to use the nice fluffy, expensive spa like towels in favor of my trusty 19 X 39\\&quot; miracle! I&#x27;ll probably never understand how or why the Aquis towels work - but WORK they do. If you need super efficient effectiveness in a small package - look no further!</li>
    <li> I have had these towels for 5 years for the purpose of camping, pool, and beach, and have never liked them. Normally, I don&#x27;t ask for too much in a towel, and I&#x27;m not concerned about softness. I like a towel that dries me well and then dries itself well. Compared to other towels I have used, this towel does neither well. In fact, I think terry cloth functions equally well if not a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It packs well and has a convenient snap loop for hanging on a tree branch, fence, or whatever&#x27;s near you. As you may also expect with a micro pile towel, the texture is not soft. Again, this towel is not bad, it&#x27;s just not good. Oh, and the nylon part of the stuff sacks nearly fell apart after the first use.</li>
    <li> Originally purchased two large towels last year. I&#x27;ve been using them when I commute by bike to work and shower. Pack nice and condensed format. They&#x27;ve held up well and i just purchased two more to offset my washing schedule at home, so I can now rotate them through my commute / wash cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would and have recommended.</li>
    <li> This is compact and absorbent - Great at home or for travel!  I use it as a hair towel after cowashing my curly hair.  I chose a darker color because I use a dark hair product and didn&#x27;t want the stains to show.</li>
    <li> Pittsburgh had better look out.  There&#x27;s a new Terrible Towel in town, and it&#x27;s this one!!  It&#x27;s like trying to dry yourself off with a big sheet of saran wrap when you get out of the shower.  I&#x27;ve never actually attempted to do that, mainly due to saran wrap&#x27;s transparency and the idea of seeing my gross body wrapped up like a hoagie being somewhat repulsive, not to mention the daunting task of rolling it all back up into the saran wrap box without nicking my pecker on that corner with all the teeth on it.  Anyway, where was I?  Oh yeah, this towel sucks.</li>
    <li> This towel was very absorbent. It was great for wriging out clothes in because it would absorb a ton of the water out of them. Unfortunately, wringing it out is much more difficult and since it holds so much water, it doesn&#x27;t actually dry very fast. If you really soak some water into these, they take quite a while to dry hanging by their loop - it certainly won&#x27;t dry completely overnight.</li>
    <li> Good size, not as soft as my small white one but I like the bigger size and the color. Bought it for when my hair gets dyed and didn&#x27;t want to have to keep getting the dye stain out of my white towel which is also microfiber. Also my hair will be getting a lot longer.</li>
    <li> Had the beige waffle Aquis but showed up the washed off hair color every time I&#x27;d wash my hair till I discovered they had the dark gray which is a much better choice for colored hair.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old is in his school swim team and has swim practice twice a week.  I place this in his bag so he doesn&#x27;t lug around a huge towel. Perfect for our needs.</li>
    <li> I received a white towel in a package. Not a grey one in the bag like the picture. It was a gift to my mother and she said it was fine so I didn&#x27;t return it and she loves it for when she swims laps.</li>
    <li> I have had these before; they do not disappoint!  Perfect for helping to dry my hair, and drying out the shower!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this towel. I got the large size and it is perfect for wrapping my long hair after a shower. I love the color, too. I had the white one before and after a few washes it turned a little yellow. I guess that&#x27;s what happens when the towel is so absorbent, it absorbs every single color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 5ft9in woman with a normal/thin frame. I bought this towel to take to the gym. It was just a few crucial inches too short and narrow, such that I couldn&#x27;t anything in the gym without one hand clutched to keep the towel carefully position for modesty. It would barely overlap when I wrapped it around myself, was a bit too short for comfort, and wouldn&#x27;t stay wrapped --definitely an irritation if you&#x27;re trying to stay a little modest in a communal locker room. Getting dried with it was a bit like getting dried off with a generous hand-towel -- sure you can do it, but it&#x27;s irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual fabric is fine, about what you&#x27;d expect for a travel towel -- not plush but it gets the job done. I just think the whole towel would benefit from adding 2 inches in each direction. I&#x27;m going to try ordering the next size up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the loop they put on it for hanging it up, because I use this on my hair and it gets stuck in it.  However, it matches my bathroom and sucks up water great.  I have several in several colors, just needed a gray one.</li>
    <li> this towel is absorbent and large enough for my hair, but after a few washes, it developed a horrible smell.  i&#x27;ve tried washing with bleach and other nice smelling detergents, but i can&#x27;t get rid of the smell and wound up tossing it.  never had this issue with other microfiber towels, so maybe i just got a bad one.  will try another brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great backpacking towel, super-absorbent and large enough to actually dry off more than just parts of your body or gear.  And at half to one-third the price of much smaller \\&quot;backpacker&#x27;s\\&quot; microfiber towels, it&#x27;s a great value too.  I have two and I give them as gifts to my friends and family that backpack.</li>
    <li> I own one - it does my hair and my whole body......and then I run it over the squeegied shower door.  It is a thirsty towel.  Dries like a champ in our AZ dryness.  I raved about mine to a friend and she asked where I got it.  So I ordered her one.  She loves hers too!!!</li>
    <li> I took this towel on a sailing trip and it was great--much better than a large cotton terrycloth towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite it&#x27;s smallish size, it absorbs effectively (more than enough to dry you completely), then dries itself quickly so you can use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The built in loop with a strong snap are a great bonus that let you attach it to rigging to dry without fear that the wind would blow it away (as it did with other people&#x27;s towels).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small size made it fit effortlessly even in a small carry on bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought two towels, this one for drying off after ocean swimming, and an even smaller Aquis one for drying off after fresh water showers. Even the smaller one is enough to dry you thoroughly (and then dry itself quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are GREAT TOWELS FOR TRAVEL and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM.</li>
    <li> The Aquis Adventure Microfiber Towel is just what we were searching for. The reason we purchased this type of towel is that we were using so much electricity running our dryer to get our traditional bath towels dry. This towel dries a person after showering and could be used again right away (according to my husband). It absorbs the water from a body without even rubbing. It works very well for drying hair also. This towel doesn&#x27;t feel clingy, cold, or soggy against a body while using it (which was how the Micronet brand felt when we tried it). It dries quickly, takes up very little shelf space, and launders well. We just hang it to dry and it doesn&#x27;t get hard to the touch like traditional towels seem to when hung to dry. Upon seeing the 19 x 39 inch towel, I was concerned it might not be large enough to do the job; but my husband tried it first and said it was plenty big. We liked it so much that we purchased several more.</li>
    <li> Great for travellers. This product is a great a towel or can be used as a blanket. This is great fr backpack traveling as it is full size but folds up small and dries fast.</li>
    <li> Love this towel!! It&#x27;s super quick and very absorbent, and quick to dry too. Exactly what I expected, although the size is a little smaller than what I am used to using to dry my whole body.</li>
    <li> this is the best towel..i have six</li>
    <li> Great for the gym or travel, it dries really fast and the size is perfect.</li>
    <li> Adequate size for the gym. Absorbent and light-weight. Nice color. I have washed it several times and it is still absorbent.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for the gym as they take up a lot less space than a regular cotton towel in your bag. I have no problem completely drying with this size and I am 6&#x27; 165lb, so they should work for most people.</li>
    <li> Absorbs Fast as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me of a shammy except its cloth.&lt;br /&gt;Only intended to use to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Currently used multiple times daily after washing my hands.&lt;br /&gt; Prefer over regular towel cause u just have to touch it to dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;Also, used weekly to pat hair dry after shampoo/ conditioner&lt;br /&gt;I would like another one but I have no future plans to invest any more money unless the price drops Significantly!&lt;br /&gt;Expensive per square inch for a towel.</li>
    <li> I got this towel to help me dry my hair quickly in the morning. It works great for that. My only complain is the color. I ordered the towel in graphite and it isn&#x27;t even close to matching the color in the image. I&#x27;d call it closer to lavender. Not a big deal for me, but a more accurate image would be nice.</li>
    <li> I bring them along on my bicycle commute and use them when I shower. They dry me off OK and they dry out fast.</li>
    <li> This towel works to dry my shoulder length hair, allowing me to use a towel and get my back dried without constantly dripping hair.</li>
    <li> We have used high performance synthetic camping towels for 8 years. The Aquis are much better than previous generations of the blue or yellow camp towels. While they are compact and dry quickly, the feel is like terrycloth - soft and luxurious. You know what I mean if you&#x27;ve ever used the older versions. These towels dry your body well, dry faster than terrycloth as well as the old camp towels they replaced.</li>
    <li> Got two of these so I could get free shipping. They soak up sweat and water like no other towel. I got them to save space in my pack during hiking trips but I&#x27;ve found myself using them after workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that the fabric has a harsh texture, but I guess that&#x27;s a function of it&#x27;s function</li>
    <li> Definitely get the large. The large barely covered me and and definitely not my husband. Small or medium are probably meant for hair or face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work like the rest of the reviews say.</li>
    <li> Great item-thanks for fast perfect ship and great price!</li>
    <li> I used 2 of these towels for an entire summer while working for a summer camp.  They work just as they are supposed to.  They dry you well as a personal towel, and dry pretty fast (over night if it is hung properly).  The towels are not really comfortable but they are not awful either, they are rougher than a bath towel but work much better for traveling.  It can fold up small and is not difficult to transport at all.  Biggest complain is the size is misleading.  The large (19 x 39 in) was not true.  I have a 34 in waist and the towel would not wrap all the way around my waist. So for privacy I would recommend a larger size. Over all it is a great product and does what it says.</li>
    <li> After years of travel and even working at an outfitter selling tons of travel towels that just don&#x27;t seem to do the job, I have found the best of the bunch.  It has replaced my bathroom towel for the house and I have 2 for travel bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you run it over your skin it pulls the water in one pass&lt;br /&gt;Even in humid environments it dries faster than my &amp;#34;travel brand&amp;#34; underwear&lt;br /&gt;The snap ring on the corner is a very nice touch as opposed to a loop</li>
    <li> I use this for my hair only, it cuts my drying time in half, I am thinking about purchasing another, I love it.</li>
    <li> I should have got the larger size but otherwise I like this towel.  It doesn&#x27;t drag as much as the other brand of microfiber towel I purchased.</li>
    <li> BELGIUM WAFFLES&lt;br /&gt;½ cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees)&lt;br /&gt;1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast, at room temperature&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons sugar&lt;br /&gt;2 cups lukewarm whole milk (90 to 100 degrees)&lt;br /&gt;¼ pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted,&lt;br /&gt;plus extra for the waffle iron&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons honey&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract&lt;br /&gt;1¼ teaspoons kosher salt&lt;br /&gt;2 cups all-purpose flour&lt;br /&gt;2 extra-large eggs&lt;br /&gt;¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li> I really wanted to give this towel a 5-star rating, but will hold back one. I recently moved and got a longer bike commute with the package. I cannot not take a shower at the office any longer. No place to store anything at work, so I&#x27;m carrying what I need in a backpack. Hence the urgency for a lightweight towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towel does what towels do, even better than my ordinary cotton household towels. It does not have the same slinky syntetic feel as some other \\&quot;camping towels\\&quot; I&#x27;ve tried througout the years. And it dries completely in a few hours on the back of my office chair. To make this towel perfect it would only have to be one (1) inch longer. Then I would have been able to easily tie it around my 33\\&quot; waist. If you&#x27;re a 32\\&quot; or smaller I assume this would be a tremendous item. I&#x27;m actually contemplating buying the size XL and cut it down to my meassurements - it&#x27;s that good!</li>
    <li> The towel is a nice size and comfortable still wraps around my waist but folds down to a small size. My main problem (with this and other similar style towels) is that it starts to smell after awhile. I wash the towel fairly regularly but a smell starts to build up. I&#x27;ve had this problem with another similar style of towel, so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing it wrong or what. I&#x27;ll lay it out to dry in my trunk most of the time after I use it and then wash it after about 5-6 uses but the smell still builds up.</li>
    <li> bought this to go backpacking around central america. i was a bit weary that this smallish towel would be able to dry me well enough . . . but it worked perfectly and folded up small and flat into its pouch to fit back in my backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the little loop was perfect to hang dry it without worrying about it blowing or falling off.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a week long expedition in a tropical jungle. The towel is really light, compact and dries quickly. The fabric is soft and absorbent. It comes with breathable pouch so it can be stored on the go.</li>
    <li> i have very long, very thick hair..... i got sick of spending my life under the blow dryer.....so now, i wash, condition, wrap in this towel.... done!!&lt;br /&gt;it is PERFECT for travel…dries VERY QUICKLY,  takes up no space,  and weighs nothing!!  resists bacteria... resists odors..... great product!!!!</li>
    <li> i have heavy long thick hair and this cuts down the drying time.  Also my hair is colored so it cuts out ruining white towels.</li>
