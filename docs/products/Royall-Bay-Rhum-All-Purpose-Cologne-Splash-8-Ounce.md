      <li>The scent is wonderful</li>
      <li>Excellent.</li>
      <li>I have been using Royall Bay Rhum for years and this was the best price I have ever seen.  </li>
      <li>Item arrived as scheduled in excellent condition.  </li>
      <li>It is still a wonderful scent.</li>

      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great price.  </li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great fragrance for the collector and enthusiast.</li>
      <li>Great deal and beats having to travel to the Bahama&#x27;s to get it.</li>
      <li>great service from AMAZON</li>
      <li>Would recommend this to anyone looking for a great aftershave.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s GOOD.</li>
      <li>husband loved it.  </li>
      <li>Nothing this good could be an also-ran.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good ones anyway.</li>
      <li>He loved it</li>
      <li>Keep up the good work.</li>
      <li>We are very pleased with the Royall Bay Rhum Cologne</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I had used Bay Rhum some years ago and really liked it.</li>
      <li>I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity.</li>
      <li>This once great product isn&#x27;t worth its shipping charges and any retailer of consequence should be ashamed to carry this product and Amazon embarrassed to still be marketing it.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>I have tried all but two (Rugby and Muske) and each one is exquisite, high-quality, potent fragrance, erring on the side of natural, and dinstinguished.</li>
      <li>The seller is excellent - fast, accurate and on time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I sincerely hope they improve the quality soon.</li>
      <li>love this stuff..wish the aroma lasted longer...</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent in this collection is the Royal Muske followed by the Royal Spice.</li>
      <li>Arrived safely.....</li>
      <li>It seems to have taken on a more acrid/sharp character, to my senses</li>
      <li>/&gt;Royall is my latest &amp;#34;great find&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals.</li>
      <li>One of my all time favorite fragrances for men.  </li>
      <li>Finally, the presentation is excellent, with the paper-wrapped, wax-sealed box, a substantial bottle and cast metal cap.</li>
      <li>My favorite after shave...</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very rich after shave.</li>
      <li>However, it is rather masculine and strong which is attractive to some men.</li>
      <li>This is, by far, the richest and most pleasant of bay rum after shaves I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>This is one of the more old fashioned aftershaves that gives a good burn and opens the pours and leaves a nice fresh scent.</li>
      <li>As I said, it&#x27;s not among my &amp;#34;top 25&amp;#34;, most unique fragrances, but they&#x27;re notfar off that mark.</li>
      <li>The fragrance fades very quickly after application.</li>
      <li>but it was rather strong and reminded you of your mother&#x27;s or grandmother&#x27;s spice cabinet or collection.</li>
      <li>and i have to say it has quickly become my favorite cologne...</li>
      <li>Good stuff for the old man</li>
      <li>and it is NOT the original fragrance I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>Something has changed , perhaps that its made from the original Bermuda recipe...</li>
      <li>I originally bought this in Bermuda about 20 years ago for my husband.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give these a &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34; rating and will happily keep them in my wardrobe indefinitely, as long as they are in production when a bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I have to admit that I&#x27;m ordinarily not a fan of warm, cinnamon/cardamom/clove-forward formulations.</li>
      <li>I later sampled it again in a fragrance outlet and it didn&#x27;t smell good to me either.</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although I wouldn&#x27;t quite put them in my top-25, they are all solid, high-second-tier fragrances, because they are all GOOD.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s clean fresh smell.</li>
      <li>Special fragrance worth the purchase</li>
      <li>Go ahead and try this cool and refreshing all-purpose lotion developed for royalty.</li>
      <li>However, this one has this great fresh bay leaf blast and a slightly astringent aroma that makes it almost medicinal, but nevertheless, alluring.</li>
      <li>An old favorite</li>
      <li>New customers will wonder what the \\&quot;big deal\\&quot; was all about over this venerable and well loved cologne.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
      <li>Sillage for that first half-hour to hour is stellar.</li>
      <li>shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Royall BayRhum itself: the open is a strong clove, and as it dries, the bay leaf starts to come forward.</li>
      <li>Cool, crisp, refreshing, with a spicy manly scent that lasts all day and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>The fragrance has maintained its same rich royal lyme aroma for over 50 years when I was first introduced to it by my seafaring friends.  </li>
      <li>so It is unusual.  </li>
      <li>Everything about this fragrance demands that you take it seriously; and that, I found to be a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>Fragrance is acceptable but not like original which was made in Bermuda with an actual leaf in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance really projects loudly, in a way few even very potent fragrances do.</li>
      <li>We recently bought it again and were worried because many reviewers said the new version was inferior to the old.  </li>
      <li>It seems to fade out pretty early on me.</li>
      <li>First impression was \\&quot;not too far off.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Royal Bay Rhum is a very distinctive and unforgettable scent --especially to those who, because of their allergies, have a serious reaction to it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for it&#x27;s unique fragrance unmatched by any other men&#x27;s lotion or cologne.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance has changed with the licensing of production to a new manufacturer.</li>
      <li>Stellar reviews from laypersons like myself made it seem solid, but I&#x27;ve tried bottles of &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; fragrances and been stung.</li>
      <li>Even when applied to fabric, it really only gives you 1 to 2 hours depending on your level of activity, and towards the tail end of that period, it&#x27;s nowhere near as complex and enjoyable as it is for the first half-hour or hour.</li>
      <li>But such as it is, it is VERY well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got a soft spot for Ferrari, Franck Olivier, Succes de Paris, Kenzo and Issey Miyake just like I do for Montale, Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier, Creed and L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used to like the Royal Bay Rhum but eventually became self conscious of the scent when it seemed to send anyone suffering from allergies and Hay Fever into a coughing tizzy.</li>
      <li>I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic &amp;#34;woods and spices&amp;#34; types (astringent old-man smells), and many &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber.</li>
      <li>The astringent, dry clove is the first one I&#x27;ve ever smelled</li>
      <li>I understand that it may not be as strong as it used to be (according to some reviewers), however, that must have changed sometime within the past year.</li>
      <li>I tend to peck around and try some new perfumer from time to time, a handful at a time, and this was no different.</li>
      <li>As regards Bay Rhum specifically, I think it&#x27;s my least favorite of the Royall fragrances and again, only because clove, cardamom, cinnamon don&#x27;t tend to be my &amp;#34;style&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27; - approaching 500, though I haven&#x27;t counted in some time.</li>
      <li>Very masculine scent, not overbearing on myself nevermind other people.  </li>

<li> Royall fragrances are absolutely not that.</li>

<li> On one or two other occasions I was sitting in a meeting and my fellow workers began to go into a coughing tizzy because of this scent.</li>
<li> Seriously, within an hour of using it, you could barely notice it.</li>
<li> but something&#x27;s not right</li>
<li> longevity lacks a little bit here, as it does in each of the Royall fragrances I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve noticed a change after being opened for a few weeks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Must have been a bad batch.  I&#x27;ve used this product for the last eight years but something&#x27;s not right, they must have changed the formula.  This just smells like rubbing alcohol.  This was my last time buying this product.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for it&#x27;s unique fragrance unmatched by any other men&#x27;s lotion or cologne.  It adheres to the highest standards established for gentlemen and produced solely in Hamilton, Bermuda.  The fragrance has maintained its same rich royal lyme aroma for over 50 years when I was first introduced to it by my seafaring friends.  Go ahead and try this cool and refreshing all-purpose lotion developed for royalty.</li>
    <li> Very good after shave splash. Cool, crisp, refreshing, with a spicy manly scent that lasts all day and not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> My girl friend bought me this as a christmas gift and i have to say it has quickly become my favorite cologne... and obviously she loves it. Def. would recomend.</li>
    <li> I have been using Royall Bay Rhum for years and this was the best price I have ever seen.  I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> dad loves it, hard to find in stores,younger generation say what&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> This does not reflect poorly on the seller, merely the product and it&#x27;s producer. The seller is excellent - fast, accurate and on time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product, however, is a shadow of it&#x27;s former quality. The fragrance has changed with the licensing of production to a new manufacturer. First impression was \\&quot;not too far off.\\&quot; After using for 3 weeks my impression did not improve. The fragrance fades very quickly after application. I&#x27;ve noticed a change after being opened for a few weeks. It seems to have taken on a more acrid/sharp character, to my senses anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For long time fans, this will be a disappointment. New customers will wonder what the \\&quot;big deal\\&quot; was all about over this venerable and well loved cologne. I sincerely hope they improve the quality soon. Or I will become a \\&quot;former\\&quot; fan as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent.He loved it The scent is wonderful</li>
    <li> Item arrived as scheduled in excellent condition.  Thank you.  One of my all time favorite fragrances for men.  Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance. Not sure i&#x27;ve ulearned to use the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; properly yet. It seems to fade out pretty early on me.</li>
    <li> love this stuff..wish the aroma lasted longer...great service from AMAZON</li>
    <li> I have been using Royal Lime Colognes for 30 years. I have used all of them except the Royal Lime scent. My favorite scent in this collection is the Royal Muske followed by the Royal Spice. I used to like the Royal Bay Rhum but eventually became self conscious of the scent when it seemed to send anyone suffering from allergies and Hay Fever into a coughing tizzy. I remember sitting in church with this cologne on and the lady sitting in front of me started coughing violently and eventually got up and moved to the front of the church. On one or two other occasions I was sitting in a meeting and my fellow workers began to go into a coughing tizzy because of this scent. I used to to like it but it was rather strong and reminded you of your mother&#x27;s or grandmother&#x27;s spice cabinet or collection. I understand that it may not be as strong as it used to be (according to some reviewers), however, that must have changed sometime within the past year. Royal Bay Rhum is a very distinctive and unforgettable scent --especially to those who, because of their allergies, have a serious reaction to it. However, it is rather masculine and strong which is attractive to some men.</li>
    <li> A present for my dad.</li>
    <li> Been using Bay Rhum for over 40 yrs. Love it&#x27;s clean fresh smell.</li>
    <li> This product was not what I thought I was ordering and it is NOT the original fragrance I was hoping for. The packaging is confusing, suggesting one thing and then when opened it&#x27;s different. Lemon vs Lime. Something has changed , perhaps that its made from the original Bermuda recipe...but now manufactured in the U.S. No Bay leaf in bottle anymore either.</li>
    <li> Special fragrance worth the purchase-it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped. Since its now made in USA has something to do with its staying power; still something to have on your shelf.</li>
    <li> A brief blurb to place my fragrance sensibilities: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances. My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27; - approaching 500, though I haven&#x27;t counted in some time. I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity. I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic &amp;#34;woods and spices&amp;#34; types (astringent old-man smells), and many &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber. Things often called &amp;#34;Desire&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Night&amp;#34;. I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals. Good ones anyway. And I&#x27;m not snobby about it; some of my top-25 are designer fragrances in the &amp;#60;$50 range. I&#x27;ve got a soft spot for Ferrari, Franck Olivier, Succes de Paris, Kenzo and Issey Miyake just like I do for Montale, Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier, Creed and L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Royall is my latest &amp;#34;great find&amp;#34;. I tend to peck around and try some new perfumer from time to time, a handful at a time, and this was no different. Stellar reviews from laypersons like myself made it seem solid, but I&#x27;ve tried bottles of &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; fragrances and been stung. Royall fragrances are absolutely not that. I have tried all but two (Rugby and Muske) and each one is exquisite, high-quality, potent fragrance, erring on the side of natural, and dinstinguished. They are, as I discovered after I had tried five of them, the Brooks Brothers &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; perfume house, and it shows. Nothing this good could be an also-ran.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I wouldn&#x27;t quite put them in my top-25, they are all solid, high-second-tier fragrances, because they are all GOOD. I can&#x27;t say enough, high-quality and distinguished. And, the price is unbeatable; value is indisputable when you&#x27;re into these 8oz bottles. The 4oz bottles from Brooks Brothers are over three times as expensive per oz, by the time you pay tax and shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Royall BayRhum itself: the open is a strong clove, and as it dries, the bay leaf starts to come forward. I have to admit that I&#x27;m ordinarily not a fan of warm, cinnamon/cardamom/clove-forward formulations. In fact, I can&#x27;t think of a single one that I&#x27;d recommend. However, this one has this great fresh bay leaf blast and a slightly astringent aroma that makes it almost medicinal, but nevertheless, alluring. I like the clove specifically because it&#x27;s not at all cloying, and so many &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;passion&amp;#34; fragrances that feature these aromas are coupled with a sickeningly, sticky-sweet base. The astringent, dry clove is the first one I&#x27;ve ever smelled that&#x27;s GOOD. When you smell it 10 minutes after application, you can actually picture smelling a drying spiced rum cask sitting in the sun on an island somewhere...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longevity lacks a little bit here, as it does in each of the Royall fragrances I&#x27;ve tried. Even when applied to fabric, it really only gives you 1 to 2 hours depending on your level of activity, and towards the tail end of that period, it&#x27;s nowhere near as complex and enjoyable as it is for the first half-hour or hour. Sillage for that first half-hour to hour is stellar. The fragrance really projects loudly, in a way few even very potent fragrances do. Finally, the presentation is excellent, with the paper-wrapped, wax-sealed box, a substantial bottle and cast metal cap. Everything about this fragrance demands that you take it seriously; and that, I found to be a pleasant surprise. As regards Bay Rhum specifically, I think it&#x27;s my least favorite of the Royall fragrances and again, only because clove, cardamom, cinnamon don&#x27;t tend to be my &amp;#34;style&amp;#34;. But such as it is, it is VERY well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great fragrance for the collector and enthusiast. As I said, it&#x27;s not among my &amp;#34;top 25&amp;#34;, most unique fragrances, but they&#x27;re notfar off that mark. They are clearly to be taken seriously and leave nothing but longevity to be desired. I&#x27;d give these a &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34; rating and will happily keep them in my wardrobe indefinitely, as long as they are in production when a bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is actually aftershave not cologne.  This is one of the more old fashioned aftershaves that gives a good burn and opens the pours and leaves a nice fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for years.  And, not everyone has it so It is unusual.  It&#x27;s a very rich after shave.</li>
    <li> In the years since Royal Dalton has had this line, they have changed the formula and made this product into something unrecognizable. It simply is not the same product and its a shame. Save your money. This once great product isn&#x27;t worth its shipping charges and any retailer of consequence should be ashamed to carry this product and Amazon embarrassed to still be marketing it.&lt;br /&gt;What a rip off</li>
    <li> Good stuff for the old man</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with the Royall Bay Rhum Cologne</li>
    <li> I am really not in a position to rate the product since it was the wrong fragrance I received and that I hated.  It was the Lyme fragrance and I got rid of it. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is acceptable but not like original which was made in Bermuda with an actual leaf in the bottle.  After reading the label I was disappointed to find that the product was now licensed and made in USA, it has a slightly different fragrance than the original.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the richest and most pleasant of bay rum after shaves I&#x27;ve found. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent scent and feel on the face.  Great price.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the only after shave my Father will wear. Great product. Great price.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell the way I remembered it in Bermuda. I later sampled it again in a fragrance outlet and it didn&#x27;t smell good to me either.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this in Bermuda about 20 years ago for my husband.  We recently bought it again and were worried because many reviewers said the new version was inferior to the old.  Well, to our relief, we can&#x27;t tell the difference.  It is still a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Great deal and beats having to travel to the Bahama&#x27;s to get it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had used Bay Rhum some years ago and really liked it. Although the fragrance and appearance of this product is similar, I am disappointed that it is so watered down by comparison to what I had before. Seriously, within an hour of using it, you could barely notice it. It has no lasting power whatsoever. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Arrived safely.....husband loved it.  An old favorite</li>
    <li> My favorite after shave... Very masculine scent, not overbearing on myself nevermind other people.  Would recommend this to anyone looking for a great aftershave.  You wont be disappointed.</li>
