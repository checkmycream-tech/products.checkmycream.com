    <li> I really like these bath salts.  We have tried the detox and others.  The price is fantastic.  The larger sizes really last a long time.  The bigger bags come in a heavy duty plastic with a reusable seal.  It works just fine.  They ship very quickly.  The quality of the salts is impressive, and I like that they are made in the USA.  Great company.  I have bought from them repeatedly and will continue to do so.  I even gave one as a gift.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This bath salt leave such a pleasant and relaxing aroma, just totally calms me down. Great product, will  purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love my product. Great!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m always worried about trying new things for my baths, but this worked great, it was soft on my skin and worked well.  Will definitely get more in the future, I felt so fresh physically and emotionally after my baths :)</li>
    <li> so so not bad actually really relaxing :)</li>
    <li> This salt is fantastic for conditioning skin. I mix this with the Epsom salt I purchased from same company. If you like soaking in bath salts I highly recommend this product. Me and my skin love it and my husband likes it as well. I will order it again.  I did not receive free or reduced price for review, this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Excellent bath salts! I&#x27;m a self proclaimed bath product snob. I love salts, bath fizz, bubble baths, oils... These salts smell amazing! I live in a 3 story house, and after my bath, i can go downstairs and smell the relaxing aroma from the salts. I&#x27;m not a huge menthol or eucalyptus fan, but I enjoy these. The salt is much finer than I was accustom to, which is nice because they dissolve much quicker in the warm bath. I use about 4 tablespoons per bath.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love soaking in a steamy tub with a generous handful of these salts after a hard run or intense lifting session. They keep my muscles from being sore the next day! Buying a second bag and would definitely consider this brand for other salts.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend. Very soothing and easy on the skin. I use everyday, it&#x27;s the last thing I do before I go to bed.</li>

    <li> I received the Detox Soak as a gift and I have to say I am incredibly impressed.  The packaging was sweet and minimal, with an &#x27;aroma valve&#x27; on the back.  I am one of those people who wants to open every product before I buy it to make sure I like the scent, so having the ability to smell the salts before I used them was brilliant.  I used a few handfuls in a nice relaxing bath and really loved the calming scent.  I mixed a little with body wash to scrub some tired spots, bottoms of my feet and my elbows, to maximize the exfoliation.  I was impressed by the quality of the salts and really loved that they are all natural and didn&#x27;t contain any chemicals (which is unfortunately hard to find with most bath products!)  These salts are great for a nice relaxing bath (if you have time), or even mixed with body wash in the shower or as a gentle face scrub.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about these bath salts. They smell and feel amazing and the quality of the product is evident from the moment you open the bag. I&#x27;d definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product, but the bag of salt is too small for the price that was paid for it.  Compared to other similar products this one is on the high end.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and therefore me!  will buy more.</li>
    <li> It smelled great, and my wife used it up within a month.  I think she would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> relaxing. feels so good after a bath. good product.</li>
    <li> I take salt baths all the time and got these as a gift and also the muscle soak, they smell great and make your skin feel nice. You can tell it&#x27;s good quality, I don&#x27;t see anything sinister in the ingredients either which I love! This is the first I&#x27;ve heard of this company, I can&#x27;t wait to try some more of the bath salts and the body scrubs look amazing too. They have such an awesome range to choose from.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this little bag...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some background: I am not a &amp;#34;bath person&amp;#34; by any means. Someone gifted me these luxurious salts and this is why I&#x27;m a changed woman:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The scent is amazing. You can tell you have a nice high quality, all eco product here. There is no false chemical smell like you find on a lot of other products. I think the scent is lavender. Very relaxing! I felt my whole body melt when I stepped in to the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -My daughter loves it! The salts are fun for her to scrub with, and I&#x27;m happy to know there are no chemicals on board to irritate her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I can&#x27;t wait to use this while detoxing. Definitely planning to soak in these a lot after the holidays in tandem with my annual juice cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars....</li>
    <li> I have been taking a lot of baths using mineral salts. After I used this, I felt really drained. It may be because it is a detox product and it pulled some of the toxins out of my body. One disappointing thing is that the ingredients are not list on the package so I am not sure what I&#x27;m using. I don&#x27;t think I will by this product again even though I love the San Francisco Salt Company line of products.</li>
    <li> This is the best detox soak I have ever found.  I not only use it in my bath, but I take a handful and mix it with my shower gel for a great exfoliating rub.  Love the smell - just clean and invigorating.</li>
    <li> Love this product with Eucalyptus Mint Aromatherapy Bath Salts for my Fibromyalgia</li>
    <li> Love all the San Fran salt products</li>
    <li> I loved this soak- it only takes a couple of handfuls in the bath. It scents the water beautifully, with rosemary and lavender predominating. It&#x27;s more of an herbal smell, and I think that men would enjoy it as much as women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very relaxing smell. Rosemary is good to clear my mind, and lavender is just relaxing, both mentally and physically. They&#x27;re both also naturally healing as they inhibit the growth of germs and fungi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is made of Pacific sea salts, kelp powder, rosemary and lavender essential oils, green tea extract, aloe vera leaf juice, and vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very soothing to the skin. I found after a long soak it was good to exfoliate- old skin just sloughed off and my skin felt clean, smooth, and very soft. It&#x27;s definitely softening. It was fun to use, as if I&#x27;d had a spa treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a light brown or tan. This is one salt soak that really doesn&#x27;t completely resemble salts - I suppose because of the kelp component. It has a very natural look, feel, and fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag makes a nicer presentation than the picture might show. It&#x27;s resealable, and of a nice quality material, and it has a scent valve in the back. I think it would make a very thoughtful gift, especially if someone special has been particularly stressed or unwell.</li>
