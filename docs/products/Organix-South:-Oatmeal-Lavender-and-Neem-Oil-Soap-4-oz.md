      <li>My husband loved the soap and didn&#x27;t mind the odor.</li>

      <li>I love the Neem soaps and this one with the oatmeal and lavender is great.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS SOAP!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The smell is OK but not as pleasant as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>They seem to be way healthy for the skin and good if u have skin conditions which I do.</li>
      <li>I would have liked for it to have lasted longer.  </li>
      <li>Neem is a unique, yet powerful product and the best way to use it seems to be in a mild soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I wanted to make sure everything was taken care of.</li>
      <li>but you get a way better deal.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more to stock up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Perhaps I&#x27;ll add more after I&#x27;ve used it all.</li>
      <li>This product is OK</li>
      <li>Just know before you buy it that it is going to smell more like \\&quot;What</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this bar 4 nights in a row and already my arms look better.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite neem soaps.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use this soap</li>
      <li>Smells great, very earthy.</li>
      <li>Stops the itch healed up bites on my and my daughters legs better than prescription medicine.</li>
      <li>Finally it is lightly scented with lavender which is refreshing.</li>
      <li>I appreciate the fast service and fair price.</li>
      <li>NeemAura Naturals - Lavender Oatmeal Ultra-Sensitive Soap is my favorite so far because Neem has a very strong scent and that particular product has a beautiful scent.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Mild enough for children, turned out to be a great treatment for a case of scabies.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they are updating their packaging design or not, but all in all, this product is the best!</li>
      <li>I use the neem oil soaps because they clean and kill bacteria on your skin with drying.  </li>
      <li>and it was cool.</li>
      <li>It does have a stronger scent, somewhat like a mild oniony</li>
      <li>His skin is even more sensitive than mine, and he had no problems with it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it was worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>primrose oil is my face routine, simple and effective.</li>
      <li>This one is mostly for when your skin is acting up (works well as a first line of defence) and the other milder versions are wonderful for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, if you use this product first, you can then use scented products that will remove any residual scent.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite facial soap.</li>
      <li>This would be the first bar soap i have used without feeling the urge to scratch my skin off after use.</li>
      <li>One thing you will notice is how soft it is and how amazingly clean you are.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes in my skin, though.</li>
      <li>It has really softened my skin and firmed also</li>
      <li>Also I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really say if I would like it otherwise.</li>
      <li>Works very well with lavender and oatmeal added to it....</li>
      <li>Smells good, very small bar.</li>
      <li>The smell is lightly herbal with lavender and does not stay long with you.  </li>
      <li>I live in Florida and perspire so much in the summer months.  </li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to scents, I would not recommend this particular neem soap as the lavender scent is over powering.  </li>
      <li>My skin felt very soft from using this soap, but I could not abide the smell of it.</li>
      <li>in?\\&quot; and not so much like \\&quot;Irish Spring\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>The smell is of natural lavender and it cleans me quite well.  </li>
      <li>It may still be too early.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin soft and soothes the patchy areas like nothing else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>In fact, the neem oil leaves my skin feeling soft almost as if I had applied a face cream after washing.  </li>
      <li>So far I like it</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s made of identifiable ingredients.</li>
      <li>have very sensitive skin, with patches of dryness (a little eczema); in truth I have always had mild skin issues of varying types.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t leave soap scum like most standard soaps do.  </li>
      <li>little lather, does not seem to do much for my itchy skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is my favorite facial soap. The price has gone up on the Organix South website, so I ordered it here. I received my soap the day before I got the other items in my order, which were Prime items! I appreciate the fast service and fair price. I will be ordering more to stock up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the soap:&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, with patches of dryness (a little eczema); in truth I have always had mild skin issues of varying types. I heard of Theraneem and tried it out. It makes my skin soft and soothes the patchy areas like nothing else I&#x27;ve found. And it&#x27;s made of identifiable ingredients. This followed by a little evening primrose oil is my face routine, simple and effective. I use a few different Theraneem bar soaps for my head and body as well. Try it out! And a tip: You can order &amp;#34;factory seconds&amp;#34; (irregular) bars of soap on the Organix South website--there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the soap but you get a way better deal. This particular formula, though--the oatmeal lavender &#x27;flavor&#x27;--is not available at the discount. That&#x27;s why I opted for amazon which has cheaper shipping.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because a friend of mine brought scabies into my home a while ago and I wanted to make sure everything was taken care of. I hope no one has to go through the pain and freaked-ness of dealing with that...No fun I tell you...But anyways I read a lot about tee tree oil and neem oil products. They seem to be way healthy for the skin and good if u have skin conditions which I do. I have a skin condition on my arms that i&#x27;ve had since birth. I&#x27;ve used this bar 4 nights in a row and already my arms look better. I can&#x27;t wait to see if it keeps clearing up.</li>
    <li> Some have mentioned a smell to this soap.  I either got used to it or it wasn&#x27;t so bad.  Hubby didn&#x27;t complain anyway.  It&#x27;s somewhat of a pleasant scent.  I have to say, the bar did not last long.  I figure for what I paid for it I would have liked for it to have lasted longer.  Also I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin. I don&#x27;t think it was worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive to scents, I would not recommend this particular neem soap as the lavender scent is over powering.  I haven&#x27;t been able to use this soap so I can&#x27;t really say if I would like it otherwise.</li>
    <li> This soap gets the job done. I wanted something with Neem in it, but not the neem smell after reading what others had to say.  This soap does not leave a lingering fragrance.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes in my skin, though.</li>
    <li> This soap is simply divine. It seems wonderful!  Works very well with lavender and oatmeal added to it.... Give it try you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with dry, itchy skin due to dry Colorado climate and hypothyroidism. Using this helps a great deal.</li>
    <li> Meh. So so product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very little lather, does not seem to do much for my itchy skin. Won&#x27;t buy another. Overpriced and not useful.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite neem soaps.  I don&#x27;t like the earthy lavender scent, this one doesn&#x27;t have it like other lavender products.</li>
    <li> I love the Neem soaps and this one with the oatmeal and lavender is great.  I use the neem oil soaps because they clean and kill bacteria on your skin with drying.  I live in Florida and perspire so much in the summer months.  I find this soap wonderful in keeping me feeling very clean..</li>
    <li> So far I like it but I think it will take a while to truly know how it is doing. It seems to not be over drying and feels good on the skin. I purchased because of allergic outbreaks of redness.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> Smells good, very small bar. I suffer from eczema and other skin irritant issues. This would be the first bar soap i have used without feeling the urge to scratch my skin off after use. I recommend to anyone who hasn&#x27;t found a solution to their itchy skin...</li>
    <li> i got the version without the oatmeal and it was cool. this version just doesn&#x27;t last. i might have gotten 5 good uses out of it before it melted into nothingness. will not buy again</li>
    <li> While the bar is very small, it lathers as soon as the water hits it.  You simply have to wipe the wet bar with your hand and then rub your hands together and the lathering begins.  The smell is lightly herbal with lavender and does not stay long with you.  One thing you will notice is how soft it is and how amazingly clean you are.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap that I buy for my toddler. She had a few eczema patches on her arm when she was a baby so my mother-in-law bought the Organix-Theraneem Kids &amp; Babies cleansing bar. It cleared up the patches in a short period of time. When it ran out it was easier for me to get the Organix-Theraneem Oatmeal &amp; Lavendar bar which works just as well. My daughter has not had any patches reappear since I&#x27;ve been using the Theraneem soap. I had actually forgotten she had the eczema until I recently noticed a family member&#x27;s baby had some eczema patches so I recommended this soap. The packaging mine came in is in their trademark yellow and green packaging (not the the one that you see pictured). I&#x27;m not sure if they are updating their packaging design or not, but all in all, this product is the best!</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema and I had watched on a tv episode that neem can help treat it. We bought this and after about a week or 2 her eczema was gone. It smells so amazing and has worked incredibly!  We always have it on hand!</li>
    <li> Helps heal and keep skin irritations away.  Mild enough for children, turned out to be a great treatment for a case of scabies.  Who knew??</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other oatmeal products in the past and found they made my skin feel dry.  This soap is just the opposite.  I assume it is the neem oil, because the soap cleanses well, but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  In fact, the neem oil leaves my skin feeling soft almost as if I had applied a face cream after washing.  I use this product in conjunction with the Theraneem cream and the two work wonderfully together.  Unlike other soaps containing oil/cream, the soap lasts for a long time.  I&#x27;ve had the soap for almost four months and use it liberally twice a day.  I estimate I still have another two or maybe even three months left at the rate I&#x27;m using the soap.  Finally it is lightly scented with lavender which is refreshing.</li>
    <li> Stops the itch healed up bites on my and my daughters legs better than prescription medicine.</li>
    <li> I have to say this is the best soap I have used on my face and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> My skin felt very soft from using this soap, but I could not abide the smell of it. My husband loved the soap and didn&#x27;t mind the odor. His skin is even more sensitive than mine, and he had no problems with it. Just know before you buy it that it is going to smell more like \\&quot;What did I step in?\\&quot; and not so much like \\&quot;Irish Spring\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Neem is known to be a miracle plant with healing properties for a wide range of skin care issues. This is the stronger version of the Neem soap. If your skin needs immediate attention then this product is the one to select. It does have a stronger scent, somewhat like a mild oniony scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you use this product first, you can then use scented products that will remove any residual scent. I&#x27;ve tried both the milder soap and this soap and like using both. This one is mostly for when your skin is acting up (works well as a first line of defence) and the other milder versions are wonderful for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NeemAura Naturals - Lavender Oatmeal Ultra-Sensitive Soap is my favorite so far because Neem has a very strong scent and that particular product has a beautiful scent. Neem is a unique, yet powerful product and the best way to use it seems to be in a mild soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the Neem soaps, you may notice your skin becoming especially healthy. Unlike less-than-natural soaps - this soap won&#x27;t irritate your skin and the oatmeal in the soap is especially calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are allergic to regular soaps, give this a try or try the Lavender Oatmeal one which&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is perfectly creamy and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do note - this product has a stronger scent, but it is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> The smell is of natural lavender and it cleans me quite well.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave soap scum like most standard soaps do.  It does leave some, but far less.  The bar also lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SOAP! Smells great, very earthy.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Love it! Will do business with them again.Exactly as described.  Love it! Will do business with them again.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice just like being at the spa! I will definitely try this again!!! May try other sents as well.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like the product but for me it dried out my skin after use. But i have horribly complected skin so its not a surprise or something that uncommon.</li>
    <li> This Soap is Absolutely Amazing!! It has really softened my skin and firmed also, I  never want to go back to using any other soap again.</li>
    <li> I always hope that a product is as advertised.  This product is OK but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin yet.  It may still be too early.  The smell is OK but not as pleasant as I would have liked. Perhaps I&#x27;ll add more after I&#x27;ve used it all.</li>
