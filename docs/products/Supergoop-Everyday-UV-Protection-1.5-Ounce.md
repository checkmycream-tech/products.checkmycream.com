      <li>Absolutely love Supergoop.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Also, I LOVE how this product doesn&#x27;t make my face oily.</li>
      <li>Also love that it does not have strong &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; scent.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It rubs in easily, isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy, it is waterproof for up to 80 minutes (I&#x27;d have to double-check that,</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m fine.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t even get me started on what that does to my daughter&#x27;s fine hair...</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>It is also scent FREE, which is a huge bonus for me.</li>
      <li>This is important to me because I put my makeup on afterwards</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth,  </li>
      <li>I use it on the whole family :)</li>
      <li>The pros: this sunscreen is pretty light and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>I love Gwyneth Paltrow and will pretty much follow any advice that she shills out when it comes to beauty products.</li>
      <li>but this one is a great one for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>I think other face SPF sun protection is just as good.</li>
      <li>Great for everyday use under makeup as well!</li>
      <li>I first tried it in a trial size from Sephora and have bought it since.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit it--I bought this sunscreen because it was featured on GOOP.</li>
      <li>Really gentle on my skin, and no sunburn!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s it), and it received a low toxicity rating on the EWG database site.  </li>
      <li>Light and not heavy on your skin and an SPF of 30😃</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I spent many months searching for a high quality replacement.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty obsessed with skincare, so I am willing to shell out for a good sunscreen that isn&#x27;t laden with horrendous chemicals, but knocked off a star because my wallet would appreciate a lower price point.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I still use California Baby on their bodies (I&#x27;ve figured out how much to use to be able to rub it in without leaving the ghostly glow), Supergoop has been a godsend for their little faces.  </li>
      <li>After trying many other products, including those that were recommended for sensitive skin, I found this product to be reaction-free!</li>
      <li>My main purpose in purchasing the product was because the description stated that it was sweatproof and water proof.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>As advertized, this seems to be one of the few sunscreens that doesn&#x27;t cause too many pimples to pop up on my face.</li>
      <li>My favorite, everyday sunscreen.</li>
      <li>It seeps right in and doenst sit on the surface nor does it stay white.</li>
      <li>I had been having a new allergic reaction to sunscreen where I was breaking out with itchy bumps on my chest.</li>
      <li>Some products have the tendency to be fully absorbed in my skin, leaving me kinda dry.</li>
      <li>I only use it on my face though really.</li>
      <li>It is not too heavy or light.  </li>
      <li>The primary con: it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
      <li>You have complete coverage for the entire day.  </li>
      <li>The tube is an odd shape that falls over easily if placed tube down in a medicine chest (no big deal, so I keep it in a drawer).</li>
      <li>Most of the \\&quot;less-toxic\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve tried over the past five years (rated 1 or 2 on the EWG site) are full of zinc and leave my children and I looking scary with that sickly white (and greasy) film everywhere.  </li>
      <li>Supergoop is so much easier to apply and my hands aren&#x27;t a mess afterwards.  </li>

<li> Very mediocre.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s annoying.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Supergoop! for three months on my face and body and I have not encountered allergic or breakout issues. However, I did notice little rectangular flecks scattered across my body after applying the lotion (about 1 mm x 2 mm, clear color, looks like plastic film). I use two different bottles of Supergoop, this one and the 15 oz bottle, both have the flecks. It&#x27;s annoying.</li>
    <li> AFter reading some reviews and seeing a good rating on EWG&#x27;s database, I decided to give this a try. I was used to using those messy sticky sunscreens for my kids, like California Baby and Badger Balm.  Supergoop is so much easier to apply and my hands aren&#x27;t a mess afterwards.  I hope it is still considered a \\&quot;physical\\&quot; sunblock, as recommended for preschool age children.  I could see using this myself daily.</li>

It rubs in easily, isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy, it is waterproof for up to 80 minutes (I&#x27;d have to double-check that, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s it), and it received a low toxicity rating on the EWG database site.  I&#x27;ve since purchased the 15 oz. pump (had to get it at Diapers.com because I needed it within two days and Amazon didn&#x27;t carry it Prime) and my husband and I use it as our daily sunscreen.  It also doesn&#x27;t have any sort of detectable fragrance, which is also something that is very important to me.  (I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;m not into smelling like a pina colada as I tote my kiddos on summertime errands.)</li>
    <li> Love the stuff! With two active boys we&#x27;re outside 90% of the time and this never leaves me feeling greasy, smelly or sunburned! I use it on the whole family :)</li>
    <li> This sunblock is great. Usually when I switch any sort of skincare product, I find that I break out for a day or 2 before my skin adjusts. That didn&#x27;t happen this time! Also, I LOVE how this product doesn&#x27;t make my face oily. This is important to me because I put my makeup on afterwards and I don&#x27;t have time to wait for it to dry. Your skin will thank you for it!</li>
    <li> I wear a lot of different sunscreens for working out etc but this one is a great one for everyday wear. Very light and not greasy. My skin looked very good after using it. Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like some sunscreens.</li>
    <li> non oily. not pore clogging. Could not be any happier with this sunscreen. It seeps right in and doenst sit on the surface nor does it stay white. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very mediocre. Totally overpriced for the quality. No different than drugstore brands.</li>
    <li> I had been having a new allergic reaction to sunscreen where I was breaking out with itchy bumps on my chest. After trying many other products, including those that were recommended for sensitive skin, I found this product to be reaction-free! Very pleased with the consistency, it&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the consistency of this sunscreen and the size is great to stuff in your purse.  I only use it on my face though really. Otherwise this bottle would go fast and its too expensive to be buying it that often.</li>
    <li> Really gentle on my skin, and no sunburn!</li>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen. Non greasy and effective.  Also love that it does not have strong &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; scent. Would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, a hint of sunscreen scent to it.  Goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I was concerned when I saw the small size of the container.  Not to worry though, such a small amount goes a very long way.  I applied the lotion in the morning and did not need to reapply the entire day.  This was on a Caribbean cruise!  No sunburn the entire cruise!</li>
    <li> My usual everyday 30 spf moisturizer (high quality from a dermatologist) is no longer being made. I spent many months searching for a high quality replacement. I have finally found it!!! After reading a review in a fashion mag, they RAVED about it, I had to try it. It is truly a great product. Leaves no white residue, is not greasy and fully moisturizes my skin. Some products have the tendency to be fully absorbed in my skin, leaving me kinda dry. This one does not leave me dry at all. My skin loves it. My only issue is, I&#x27;m accustomed to applying my moisturizer all over my face, including eyelids. However, Supergoop does get into my eyes after a bit of sweat/sun and causes irritation. I simply avoid applying it too close to my eyelashes and I&#x27;m fine. I really am happy I found this product.</li>
    <li> The description of the product said that it is sweat proof and waterproof.  When I received the supergoop the instructions say to reapply every two hours if excesive sweating, swimming occurs.  My main purpose in purchasing the product was because the description stated that it was sweatproof and water proof.</li>
    <li> It is not too heavy or light.  You have complete coverage for the entire day.  I  use it underneath my makeup.</li>
    <li> Great UV protection. Moisturizing, but not greasy at all. My favorite, everyday sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply.  The tube is an odd shape that falls over easily if placed tube down in a medicine chest (no big deal, so I keep it in a drawer).</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Supergoop.  It is the only facial moisturizer with spf 30 that doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy.  It is also scent FREE, which is a huge bonus for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great summertime protection against the sun. I have used this product for years and am happy to have more of it again.</li>
    <li> I used this product on a recent trip to Scottsdale.  I reapplied approximately every 60-90 minutes since I was in and out of the pool and I never burned.  I feel better about using a product that doesn&#x27;t contain dangerous chemicals and this one didn&#x27;t make my skin break out either.  I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> spendy.  I think other face SPF sun protection is just as good.</li>
    <li> And smells great! Love this oil-free wonder for the summer! Great for everyday use under makeup as well! Love supergoop</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit it--I bought this sunscreen because it was featured on GOOP. I love Gwyneth Paltrow and will pretty much follow any advice that she shills out when it comes to beauty products. The pros: this sunscreen is pretty light and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy. The primary con: it&#x27;s not cheap. I&#x27;m pretty obsessed with skincare, so I am willing to shell out for a good sunscreen that isn&#x27;t laden with horrendous chemicals, but knocked off a star because my wallet would appreciate a lower price point.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen!! Great for both face and body. Blends very easily.</li>
    <li> This has become my go-to moisturizer/sunscreen in the summertime and I love it.  Goes on smooth,  isn&#x27;t at all greasy, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> As advertized, this seems to be one of the few sunscreens that doesn&#x27;t cause too many pimples to pop up on my face.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I first tried it in a trial size from Sephora and have bought it since. Light and not heavy on your skin and an SPF of 30😃</li>
