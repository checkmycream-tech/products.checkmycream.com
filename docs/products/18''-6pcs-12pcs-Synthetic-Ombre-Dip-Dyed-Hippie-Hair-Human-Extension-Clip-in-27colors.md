### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great look and color, just like the picture</li>
      <li>The product is good even though one of my clips detached from the hair easily.</li>
      <li>Love them</li>
      <li>THESE SO MUCH!!!</li>
      <li>Other than that: great color, easy to brush, easy to use.</li>
      <li>there were only 5 pieces included and they were very cheap, not as descried as in the information , will keep because not expensive and going to give to my sisters kids to play with,if you want one on the side of your head its ok.</li>
      <li>my daughter was so excited to get this in the first time she put a comma brush through it</li>
      <li>They are amazing, if you knot them they will become brittle but if you lightly straight iron them they will be just like new again.</li>
      <li>It did take about 18 days to arrive but it was worth it.</li>
      <li>but the color is amazing but its cheaper than sallys and i curl mine and flat iron it</li>
      <li>Color is vibrant and fun!</li>
      <li>Simply they aren&#x27;t amazing but nice for a little bit of color.</li>
      <li>but they dont shed and they stay in pretty well.</li>
      <li>The tips are a bit more green than in the photo, so the colors aren&#x27;t really true to life.</li>
      <li>and they feel like real hair</li>
      <li>really like them just the ends where fuzzy</li>
      <li>Feels very plastic-like.</li>
      <li>They have a very chemically smell.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have high hopes for the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Perhaps I would be a little more open to them if the smell wasn&#x27;t so strong, but since it is I don&#x27;t really have the time or place to let them air out here in my tiny dorm room that is going to simultaneously let me breathe,</li>
      <li>The Extensions work very well and you can straighten them with no mess or melting of the hair.</li>
      <li>They did lose a little bit of color in a pool for about a good 5 hours, not much color though</li>
      <li>would not recommend this product to anyone, particularly children or people with allergies or sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>soo soft</li>
      <li>Additionally, the pieces are only one inch wide, which means lots of clipping and unclipping - especially if you&#x27;re trying to get a full coverage.</li>
      <li>Has a very odd odor and washing did not remove but did make it less potent.</li>
      <li>And there&#x27;s only 6 small pieces, so it&#x27;s not like this is a full set if you want to make it look like an under-dye or anything.</li>
      <li>and they are now hanging outside to dry, in the hopes that I can remove enough of the smell to wear them near my body...</li>

<li> unfortunately I&#x27;ve currently got them in a bag with some other hair extensions</li>
<li> The only reason I give this 3 stars is that it&#x27;s SOOO HEAVY.</li>
<li> Well, I should have listened to all the other reviews, but I went on ahead and bought them anyway....</li>
<li> However it&#x27;s a little hard to think about what styles would look like an actual dye job that would be so broken up and cover such little</li>
<li> They are skimpy little wefts that look dollar store quality.</li>
<li> biggest waste of my gift card.</li>
<li> There is an inch of green at the ends.</li>
<li> They tangle easy the texture is awful, the ends were crimped from the package and no matter how wet I get them</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what is used to dye this synthetic hair, but the fumes coming off the hair and out of the package are intolerable.</li>
<li> There was a weird aqua green color on the ends and they are single clips not groups also have a weird smell</li>
<li> The hair was falling off of the clips, 2 of the clips were broken and they we&#x27;re all small clips.</li>
<li> The people that complain about the smell have never worked with artificial hair.</li>
<li> But they do have a really bad chemical smell, and one of these days I&#x27;ll get to air them out, maybe...</li>
<li> They had the worst odor coming off of them and when you washed them it got worse</li>
<li> These smell horrible!</li>
<li> These extensions were awful.</li>
<li> Whatever dye they use smells horrible!!!</li>
<li> Terrible just terrible  </li>

    <li> Terrible just terrible  my daughter was so excited to get this in the first time she put a comma brush through it it came all to pieces</li>
    <li> I have washed these 5 times and the still stink! Whatever dye they use smells horrible!!!</li>
    <li> There was a weird aqua green color on the ends and they are single clips not groups also have a weird smell but they dont shed and they stay in pretty well.</li>
    <li> Feels very plastic-like. Photo is misleading; only comes with six individual clips. Has a very odd odor and washing did not remove but did make it less potent. Better for wearing in an updo to cover the fake look of it. Color is vibrant and fun! Simply they aren&#x27;t amazing but nice for a little bit of color.</li>
    <li> The hair was falling off of the clips, 2 of the clips were broken and they we&#x27;re all small clips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is used to dye this synthetic hair, but the fumes coming off the hair and out of the package are intolerable. I bought these to go to a costume ball... so I&#x27;ve washed them thoroughly with shampoo and they are now hanging outside to dry, in the hopes that I can remove enough of the smell to wear them near my body... I don&#x27;t have high hopes for the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone, particularly children or people with allergies or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These smell horrible! They have a very chemically smell.  I ended up just throwing them away in the package. Doubt this is  human hair.</li>
    <li> Well, I should have listened to all the other reviews, but I went on ahead and bought them anyway.... But they do have a really bad chemical smell, and one of these days I&#x27;ll get to air them out, maybe... The tips are a bit more green than in the photo, so the colors aren&#x27;t really true to life. And there&#x27;s only 6 small pieces, so it&#x27;s not like this is a full set if you want to make it look like an under-dye or anything. Even though the picture shows 10 pieces (which may have been enough) it&#x27;s only 6 (as the title says, I just think the picture is misleading). Additionally, the pieces are only one inch wide, which means lots of clipping and unclipping - especially if you&#x27;re trying to get a full coverage. If you&#x27;re just looking for streaks that may look like highlights then these might work, or just for one panel of color in your hair. However it&#x27;s a little hard to think about what styles would look like an actual dye job that would be so broken up and cover such little area.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I would be a little more open to them if the smell wasn&#x27;t so strong, but since it is I don&#x27;t really have the time or place to let them air out here in my tiny dorm room that is going to simultaneously let me breathe, though maybe some weekend when I go home.... unfortunately I&#x27;ve currently got them in a bag with some other hair extensions I bought that I just haven&#x27;t gotten to use yet, and they&#x27;re probably stinking those up too....</li>
    <li> The product is good even though one of my clips detached from the hair easily.</li>
    <li> They do not look like the picture at all. They are skimpy little wefts that look dollar store quality.</li>
    <li> The only reason I give this 3 stars is that it&#x27;s SOOO HEAVY. I think if it came in multiple pieces it would be a bit easier to spread around the head and offset some of the weight. Other than that: great color, easy to brush, easy to use. The people that complain about the smell have never worked with artificial hair. This is what it always smells like coming out of the box, the smell goes away in all of 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> Great look and color, just like the picture</li>
    <li> really like them just the ends where fuzzy</li>
    <li> They tangle easy the texture is awful, the ends were crimped from the package and no matter how wet I get them the crimp will not come out.</li>
    <li> These extensions were awful. They had the worst odor coming off of them and when you washed them it got worse and you lost a lot of hair from washing them. I had to throw them away. biggest waste of my gift card.</li>
    <li> there were only 5 pieces included and they were very cheap, not as descried as in the information , will keep because not expensive and going to give to my sisters kids to play with,if you want one on the side of your head its ok.</li>
    <li> There is an inch of green at the ends.</li>
    <li> Its smaller than the pic but the color is amazing but its cheaper than sallys and i curl mine and flat iron it</li>
    <li> The Extensions work very well and you can straighten them with no mess or melting of the hair. It did take about 18 days to arrive but it was worth it. I would recommend for girls ages 8+. They did lose a little bit of color in a pool for about a good 5 hours, not much color though</li>
    <li> Bought this for a girl. She dug it. Still wears it all the time. End of story</li>
    <li> Mine didnt have the green at the ends ive heard about veey soft. Love them</li>
    <li> They are amazing, if you knot them they will become brittle but if you lightly straight iron them they will be just like new again. soo soft and they feel like real hair&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THESE SO MUCH!!!</li>
