      <li>Great price for a terrific perfume!</li>
      <li>I wanted something that was somewhat unique...</li>
      <li>then a sweet light sent for the rest of the day</li>
      <li>Authentic perfume in new sealed box!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the bold scent that I like.</li>
      <li>The light is fresh and light and very refined.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wildly unique and very, very alluring.</li>
      <li>and therefore it is certainly worth the money</li>
      <li>I am already running across scarves that still smell of the perfume, and it smells right.  </li>

      <li>I bought this because I was looking for my &amp;#34;new scent.&amp;#34;  I had much higher hopes for it.  </li>
      <li>the last few weeks since I&#x27;ve switched, I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments on my perfume, with most women noting how warm and modern it smelled...clean without the chemical scent that so many scents have.  </li>
      <li>This a beautiful perfume to be enjoyed by all although reasonably expensive it fragrance last along time</li>
      <li>A lot had changed in my life in the last decade, and the scent no longer fit me.  </li>
      <li>this perfume is really woody on me</li>
      <li>this was way better than any other places.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying I want to smell like I&#x27;m wearing half a bottle of perfume, but I like to be able to smell a scent on me throughout the day off and on -</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this perfume.</li>
      <li>She was surprised to receive &amp; at the reasonable price.</li>
      <li>ten years after I first started using it.  </li>
      <li>After sampling a few dozen at Nordstroms, I limited it to about three that I really liked.  </li>
      <li>In addition to being picky, I also am perfume sensitive.  </li>
      <li>She has commented several times how much she likes it.</li>
      <li>Expensive but really worth it!!!</li>

    <li> Awesome, my all time favorite. Smell the same as the one I previously purchased from Nordstrom</li>
    <li> In love with this perfume, soft and very feminine, scent lasts throughout the whole dsy</li>
    <li> I found this by accident in Nordstrom. I love this fragrance. I recieve many compliments and its easy to wear. Its sophisticated and like nothing else. Amazon had a great price and came fast.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soft, dreamy scent!  Never overpowering.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS AND GET MANY COMPLIMENTS</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery. Authentic perfume in new sealed box! This is one of my favorite scents and it smells just as good as I remember. I have a hard time making expensive perfume purchases on Amazon because I&#x27;ve been burned a few times in the past with fakes or false advertising, but this is the real deal, great price for it too.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for my &amp;#34;new scent.&amp;#34;  I had much higher hopes for it.  Having only smelling it on a strip from a magazine, it seemed like it would be a bit stronger.  I spray this scent on and I can&#x27;t even smell it on myself.  I&#x27;m not saying I want to smell like I&#x27;m wearing half a bottle of perfume, but I like to be able to smell a scent on me throughout the day off and on - what&#x27;s the point of buying a perfume you can&#x27;t even smell on yourself?  I thought this scent would be richer and stronger and do that, but it doesn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s a very weak scent.  I feel like it just disappears like alcohol as soon as I spray it on.  I&#x27;ve asked people around me if they can smell it and they say no.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and a little bummed I spent $100 on a bottle of perfume I can&#x27;t even smell.</li>
    <li> This parfum is excellent! I love how it smells on my wife and she loved receiving as a gift for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I love the smell when my wife puts it on. It reminds me of all the beautiful things that happened in my life such as me wedding day</li>
    <li> I love it. So many people ask me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing</li>
    <li> Not the my wife is a girl, but this perfume will make your wife of any age a brick house of a woman. ;-)</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, good price, the delightful fragrance I use as my signature perfume...</li>
    <li> i like this perfume, not loving it,</li>
    <li> I purchased this pricey perfume for my wife for Christmas.  I did a lot of looking around to get the best price before I purchased it and this was way better than any other places.  My wife was overjoyed.</li>
    <li> very good parfume i love to change</li>
    <li> This a beautiful perfume to be enjoyed by all although reasonably expensive it fragrance last along time and therefore it is certainly worth the money and it definitely turns heads. I highly recommend this perfume.</li>
    <li> Best perfume I own! Expensive but really worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Kudos to the seller. The delivery was prompt as ordered. The fragrance is hauntingly beautiful. This was a gift to my wife. She has commented several times how much she likes it. I now know what to get her for Valentine&#x27;s Day, etc. -- the Bottega Veneta line of bath products.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is just wonderful.  It&#x27;s the right mix of earthy tones.  Expensive but worth it.  Arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Love it! So glad I ordered it. Smelled a sample in a magazine and that is what made my decision to buy it.</li>
    <li> Wife asked for this for Christmas.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Great price for a terrific perfume!</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfum thinking I would like it but I&#x27;m not that crazy for the scent. It doesn&#x27;t have the bold scent that I like.</li>
    <li> I recently went on an odyssey to replace my signature scent.  I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit this, but I was still using Ralph Lauren Romance....ten years after I first started using it.  A lot had changed in my life in the last decade, and the scent no longer fit me.  In addition to being picky, I also am perfume sensitive.  A lot of scents will give me lingering headaches.  My demands were simple: 1.  I had to like the scent, 2. It couldn&#x27;t make me ill, and 3.  I wanted something that was somewhat unique...nothing that came with a tacky free purse in a \\&quot;gift set\\&quot;.  Scents are entirely personal - we like what we like.  That can&#x27;t be changed.  After sampling a few dozen at Nordstroms, I limited it to about three that I really liked.  I tried this one on several times, and found that not only did I like the scent - it also didn&#x27;t give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last few weeks since I&#x27;ve switched, I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments on my perfume, with most women noting how warm and modern it smelled...clean without the chemical scent that so many scents have.  I only apply it once in the morning, and it is still noticable in the evening.  I don&#x27;t spray a lot - it&#x27;s not supposed to be an air freshener, it&#x27;s parfum!  So, this bottle will last me quite a long time.  Also, the price is high enough that it will never become commonly used.  When you find the right perfume its like your favorite jeans...it fits you just right.  I am already running across scarves that still smell of the perfume, and it smells right.  It smells like me - and not just like everyone else!</li>
    <li> I love the product. Always have. The light is fresh and light and very refined. It is not a loud perfume. Subtle and doesn&#x27;t sting the nose like others do. Definitely a more sophisticated Eau de Parfum.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances!!! Great price.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how much I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s like class in a bottle. It&#x27;s wildly unique and very, very alluring. Women, as well as men, constantly ask me what scent I&#x27;m wearing. The women want to buy it and the men want to buy it for their women.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like fruity fragrances which this is not.  Never tried before but am a fan now.  Very subtle, feminine scent.</li>
    <li> Great perfume.  Definitely recommend it to your lady love</li>
    <li> My sister loves this perfume &amp; I was thrilled to find out &amp; surprise her with it. She was surprised to receive &amp; at the reasonable price.</li>
    <li> this perfume is really woody on me but i love how deep it goes and then a sweet light sent for the rest of the day, i know it works for me cos i cant smell it on me but everyone who does smell it has aksed me what are you wearing :)</li>
