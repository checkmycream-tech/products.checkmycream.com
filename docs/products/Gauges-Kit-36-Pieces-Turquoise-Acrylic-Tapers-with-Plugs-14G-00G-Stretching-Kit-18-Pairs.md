<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this one for $19.99 because the previous one that I got was missing so many pieces that I wasn&#x27;t not able to use it. I received it today and it is missing the 10G tapers and plugs. Going from 12G to 8G would be way too painful. returning this today. Do not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful! The color is perfect, material is great for stretching.</li>
    <li> I just started useing gauges for the first time I gotta say if your new start with these!!!</li>
    <li> Individualy packaged, they are smooth😂 &amp; they aren&#x27;t cheap material, just a cheap price. They&#x27;re great</li>
    <li> Never stretch with acrylic. Butthere nice.</li>
    <li> Everything you need to stretch your ears for s decent price.</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! They all came in individual bags according to guage (taper n plugs in same) color was the same as shown or even more beautiful. I get so many compliments on them. This item was definitely worth it and the price... I mean can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> This kit is amazing! When I received it I was at a 8 gauge and now I&#x27;m currently at a 0. The color is great and they&#x27;re comfortable! Would recommend for anyone looking to gauge their ears!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really great. And cheap too.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected, and very pleased with packaging. Overall expectations met :) thank you</li>
    <li> I got it as a gift, they love them. Got item quick</li>
    <li> Great Price, Great Product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love. These are great! Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> very nice! worked wonderfully and they&#x27;re very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not done. But these helped me get started on gauging my ears. Be sure to buy some kind of balm or oil to help the placement process. The plugs are great once the taper gets you all sized up. Go slowly to avoid blowouts and pain :)</li>
    <li> Good quality ! They shipped out fast and everything is labeled in bags. I recommend these 100% !!</li>
    <li> This kit made my ears dry, and itchy. there is a strange plastic smell to them I think that&#x27;s what caused the reaction. otherwise they got the job done!</li>
    <li> LOVED!!! Helped me get to 00g and nothing broke! Very happy!</li>
    <li> Its nice gaugueas and the agatha t shirt is wonderful</li>
    <li> Great, exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> honestly my favorite color out of the 3 I ordered (these, pink and purple) and I absolutely love them. and they don&#x27;t fade with alcohol so I&#x27;m thankful for that.</li>
    <li> So I looked through alot of gauges online and was only looking for tapers to go to a 0 and low and behold I found a set for cheap for myself as well as the lower sizes to help my sister start gauging her ears so it not only helped me but my sister as well... Just what I needed and very happy with it.. &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> I love this kit so much! I ordered them February 7th and they came in the mail today! Everything is labeled in bags. And it&#x27;s very helpful! I stretched to a 10g and everything was great. And the color is cute.</li>
    <li> I definitely loved the price of this kit! It&#x27;s so affordable, and the quality of the product is great :) Completely worth buying if you want to stretch your ears.</li>
    <li> They made my ears infected!... D&#x27;:</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed</li>
    <li> Nice set of rappers and plugs. They were very comfortable in my ear, no jagged or uneven edges. Definitely a must have if your continuing to size up.</li>
    <li> I wanted black but these work. Color not bad. They don&#x27;t irritate my ears. Came with every piece of the tapers and plugs</li>
    <li> I love this set! for such a cheap price you are getting a really organized, nice set of tapers and plugs. I have seen a lot of tapers that don&#x27;t grow gradually enough but i have been stretching with these and have had no pain or problems! Acrylic isn&#x27;t the most hygenic to stretch with (stainless steel would be a better route), but I&#x27;ve cleaned mine every night and have had no issues what so ever. I have soaked these in hydrogen peroxide as well as sea salt for more 10+ minutes at a time and they have had no discoloration! Im obsessed!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t wear them as jewelry rem. I had to get stainless steel ones since my ear got infected w cat but but now they look fine since I healed them and started over</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. Guages hold up well, correct sizes, and true to color. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great set! Cute color and I went from G6 to 00G extremely fast! These didn&#x27;t irritate my ears like some tapers do!</li>
    <li> I love how it came in separate packets(: they were also really easy to use and they didn&#x27;t hurt at all</li>
    <li> Sooooooo awesome! t took me a month total to get to my goal 2g (I was a 6 before I got the kit) and I love it :) nothing was wrong with the kit but for some reason I got 2 packs of the 4g lol. 5/5 stars for sure :)</li>
    <li> I received a bag full of labeled baggies all tapers have plugs and a set of bands. I&#x27;m gauging two holes per ear so this kit is really handy.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use acrylic material to stretch your ears, acrylic is a type of plastic and plastic is porous and has a higher chance of forming a bacteria, causing infection and a higher risk for a blow out.</li>
    <li> Came fast and had No problems. Would recommend. (:</li>
    <li> exactly as description came quicker than expected</li>
    <li> These were great, I had already stretched my ears a few years back and I wanted to do them again and this was just right</li>
    <li> Everything was there. The color though is mild enough to  match anything but bright enough to still standout. I love this shade of turquoise. I am already at an 8. we are also using this to slightly gauge our lips....obviously after cleaning/disinfecting the jewelry.</li>
    <li> I love this gauge kit!&lt;br /&gt;Pretty, easy to use, true to size,  and I recieved the package in a timely manner. Everything was packaged and labeled nicely!</li>
    <li> Great price for the quantity.</li>
    <li> Great product, extremely good price, and fast shipping. I have recomended this to many friends already, and I recommend this to anyone looking to start increasing his/her earring size.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! If you want a kit, this is the kit you should get!😘😍😘😍is so amazing, got it 4 days before the expected delivery and it came with everything in the picture. And it&#x27;s cute how it came in little packs Cx&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> It lied of the sizes I only got 8g thru 00g nothing smaller then that and it didn&#x27;t bring plugs</li>
    <li> Works great! Recommended!</li>
    <li> Loved it  exactly as described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so stoked on this purchase. It shipped hours after I ordered it and was here in three days. The color is gorgeous and the price is unbeatable (this whole set is less expensive than one pair of tapers and plugs in store).</li>
    <li> Super good I would recommend this if you are planing on stretching your ears. This got me to 00g smoothly :)</li>
    <li> These are perfect! So great for the price and I love the color. They got here 2 days before the earliest estimated arrival time which is great. They come in little baggies with the size printed on them, in each bag there are a set of tapers and plugs. I received all of the sizes listed. They are smooth and there are NO seam lines where plastic may have been fused together like I had read in a previous review. These are perfect. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to start stretching your ears. I included a picture of the 00 size so that you can accurately see the color. They are bright and the perfect shade of turquoise.</li>
    <li> Kept falling out and losing the gauges</li>
    <li> So I just recently went to the mall and began my ear stretching if that&#x27;s what you call it. But I only got one pair of gauges and it was 16g beginners size but I ended up spending 16$ on it and, when I found these I thought to my self what a waist of money I spent and what a rip off the mall is. You get all kinds of sizes, sizes that go up to 00g. For much cheaper. I am so happy with the color, sizes,price and the quick shipping. Best thing I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently using this product to stretch my ears, and these are working perfectly. Set came with all the sizes and is exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> They shipped on time and quickly, and I was very happy with the product, except that one of the little baggies the tapers and plugs come in was missing a plug. But despite this fact I would still order them again, I was able to just keep the tapers in until my next size up and not worry with the plugs anyways.</li>
    <li> I just received my order today and was very disappointed that every single gauge was missing their plugs , hopefully I can still get them sent to me .  But anyways , the color is lovely .</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed. Everything arrived as described. Fast shipping, no complaints or problems.</li>
    <li> Rated it a five because the product does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do. It&#x27;s a great starting kit however, I suggest that if you continue up through the double 0&#x27;s. Order a metal kit from about 8g on up because it makes it easier and more comfortable.</li>
    <li> Pretty color, every size in a labeled bag, exactly what it looks like</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter. She has been impressed with the kit. I coupled it with some ear stretching balm and she says it&#x27;s working great. Delivery was smack dab in the middle of the projected time-frame.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m IN LOVE with the kit. It arrived on time, and they came in individual labeled baggies. It is great. The color is beautiful! The quality is amazing and the price is great.  This definitely was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long while! If you&#x27;re looking for a ear stretching kit, this is a great one!</li>
    <li> These are great! Only thing is one of our 8g plugs are glow in the dark clear ish colored. Which means we don&#x27;t have a matching set to wear but oh well. Other than that they&#x27;re great</li>
    <li> Color is cute! Love how they pack it individually and it&#x27;s so much cheeper to buy it this way then individually buy one</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted and it was delivered in a timely manner!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this gauging kit after a friend talked it up quite a bit--arrived quickly, and began using on standard ear piercing I&#x27;ve had since I was...gosh, 3 years old :) So far, so good! Up to a 6g (which suuucked to stretch to lol!)&lt;br /&gt;Only flaw with this kit, which for me personally isn&#x27;t a biggie--recieved a wrong sized taper for the 00g set--was givien one 00g taper, and the other taper was a 0g. The plugs, however, were the correct size. Like I said--no biggie to me; I do not plan on going this big, but someone who would like to go to this gauge and beyond, this may be an issue. So check the set carefull ywhen you get it!&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this stretching kit.</li>
    <li> I just for these in the mail and they are amazing!!! Turquoise is my fav color so these were a dead steal and they come in these awesome little baggies with the sizes printed on the bag :) I ordered these Monday it&#x27;s Thursday so pretty quick shipping overall awesome product awesome seller</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> They do the job, but acrylic is a bad material to stretch with and I dont reccomend using this if you have the option to use metal. I was on a tight budget and these did fine however</li>
    <li> great quality!! and each size comes in individual little convenient bags. my order shipped out and arrived quick. no complaints here!!</li>
    <li> This kit is amazing, affordable, and true to color. I&#x27;m happy that I spent my money on these I&#x27;ve been waiting years to finally stretch my ears and I do believe this kit can get me there. The package was delivered so fast mine had come within 3 days !! They&#x27;re very &amp;#34;Tiffany Blue&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m just in love. If you&#x27;re are looking for a kit I recommend this to save you time &amp; money.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great quality! Color was as pictured and really awesome each size is separated in little baggies. Great price for the amount of gauges received!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Probably not the best way to stretch your ears because it&#x27;s acrylic, but worked well for me. I had no issues. I bought this with some lube for stretching and am one gauge away from goal size, 00g.</li>
    <li> great price, great product and great shipping.</li>
    <li> This set I was very pleased with they came in very fast and the quality is very nice I like these very much</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described. All sizes are seperately bagged and labelled, the color is just as pictured. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> So many pieces for so little money. And they are all in good condition. I love them.</li>
    <li> I bought these with some quality stretching balm, which I would definitely recommend with the acrylic. I love how light they are and the color is just as I expected. Some people complain about smell with the acrylic, I left a star off for that, though for me was easily remedied. I remove and drop them in a dish of hydrogen peroxide while I do my salt soaks and massage with the stretching balm.</li>
    <li> I wish I had had this kit when I gauged my 00 plugs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not only such a great deal price wise, but it&#x27;s the only way to properly stretch your ears. This kit is fantastic, the quality of the acrylic is great and the o-rings are thin, but strong, unlike many of the markets o-rings that are fat and generally too stretchy. Not only do you get tapers for 14g-00g, but you get the matching plugs as well. For me, that&#x27;s such a selling point. I personally don&#x27;t like the bulky look of tapers, especially as you go up in size, so having the ability to switch out a plug for the taper once you get to the full stretching point is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plugs are the same quality as the tapers and they look great! I am currently stretching my second holes to around a 6g or a 4g, but this kit was worth the price, even if I don&#x27;t use some the pieces. I can use the 00g&#x27;s for my current plugs, so not only did I get an entire set of tapers and plugs for size 14g through 00g, which I can use to stretch my new holes, but I got a new pair of plugs for my current holes! For the cheap price, you cannot do any better than this. Tapers alone, for only 5 by the way, and not 5 sets, but just 5 different size tapers, runs about $10 dollars. Here not only do you get a set of tapers for the entire sequence up until 00g, but you get a matching set of plugs per each taper size! Plugs can cost up to $8 dollars a pair for the same material and the same color in 00g, so that should put into perspective how good this deal is.Also, the color is very vibrant and beautiful, I really love it. Not too strong, not overbearing, but a beautiful color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m extremely happy.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and items as pictured.  These came with tapers and plugs sorted and clearly marked as to size.</li>
    <li> If they would been metal they would have been much better but still love them</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the 14gauge but other than that I love them.&lt;br /&gt;I also purchase the lobe lube, makes for a smooth stretching. :)</li>
    <li> The people who are complaining about these being poor quality shouldve paid twice for more expensive ones. These are excellent for the price, they come individually packed, look and feel nice, and the color is spot on with the picture. If youre buying these EXPECT 10$ guage kits, not high $ steel guages and youll be very happy.</li>
    <li> Great.... Love the color... the one of the pairs of  long tapers made my ears brake out though ...but plugs were fine . Made well and awesome price</li>
    <li> while many people say not to stretch with acrylic, i feel if you keep them constantly clean you are good to go. love the color and love how each size is individually bagged and labeled.</li>
    <li> Only got Tapers. No Plugs!:(</li>
    <li> Great plugs, great kit, but the color is completely off. They were more greenish, so I only use this kit for stretching and I don&#x27;t wear the plugs on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Good material and I&#x27;m already at the 10g. Good fit</li>
    <li> These gauges gave me a serious allergic reaction because the acrylic broke down in my ears. Buy the stainless steel ones.</li>
    <li> I wanted to start stretching my ears and decided to give these a try! They are perfect Iv&#x27;e stretched to 8g so far. Taking it slow and steady but I can&#x27;t wait til I complete the kit! Fast shipping and looks exactly as pictured! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product Is amazing. I used the plugs and my sister used the tapers. It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t expensive which made it even better. They arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> These came extremely fast and the color is exactly as pictured. I get compliments on the plugs that came with the tapers all the time. I am very impressed with this seller and happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love how they have the sizes in a small bags and so much cheaper then buying all the sizes separate</li>
    <li> Great set, good packaging. Each item is in their own bag and labeled. Would definitely purchase another set in the future!</li>
    <li> I am by no means a &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; when it comes to gauges. These are so comfortable and I am in love with the color. If you are considering stretching your lobes, I highly recommend this product. They arrived ahead of schedule which made me super happy! Everything was in order so it was easy to (for me not knowing what to do essentially) to figure it out &#x3D;) over all a five star review from this girl!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality and  the color was nice too I went from a 14 gauge to a 2 gauge with ease I know it&#x27;s not good for you</li>
    <li> I love them! I&#x27;m at size 6, going to 8&#x27;s now. I highly recommend to starters. WARNING: Let them sit in warm water for 10-15min before putting them in! I didn&#x27;t do that and my ear blew out.</li>
    <li> Beautiful vibrant color shipped fast</li>
    <li> Great stretching kit. Love the color and the price is unbeatable! A couple years back I had my ears stretched to a 00. I took them out, but ive missed them and wanted to stretch them back. Shipped and delivered quick.</li>
    <li> Just got my oak age and started already! Love the color and the packageing.</li>
    <li> Bought this item a month ago. Came in quickly.All the pieces were exactly described. Each size came in a little bag with the size labeled on the bag. The small bags were in a bigger back which I still use to keep the pieces together. Had no problems with the acrylic, I am currently still sizing up. The color is perfect as well! I am very pleased with the really cheap price for this set and its quality!</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re gauges. In different sizes. Thats about it, exactly what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
    <li> Works okay , I would recommend stainless steel</li>
    <li> Horrible quality. They feel like cheap plastic. They&#x27;re not smooth (you can feel the casting line in the plastic on both the tapers and the plugs). I&#x27;ve been stretching my piercings for almost a year with steel tapers. I bought these for my wife thinking she would like the color, but immediately she had issues with soreness and smell. No matter how clean you keep them these things hold bacteria badly. If you&#x27;re serious about your holes, stay away from these.</li>
    <li> Were ok for a little while, but when I got to a 2g and wore them for an extended time (perhaps a month?) the turquoise color turned white and bubbled...I wish I could post a pic! My ear was horribly sore as well...I keep my ears very clean...I don&#x27;t know what happened...they were fine, and suddenly they weren&#x27;t! I&#x27;m sticking to stone or stainless steel in the future.</li>
    <li> Everything came as it was supposed to</li>
    <li> When I order something with a picture to show the product, I expect to get what was in the picture . &amp; with this order, I did not ! Not only were they not what I ordered they were missing 3 sizes that were supposed to be in there .</li>
    <li> I bought these a month ago and wow are they amazing! I&#x27;m already down to a 10g. I love the color and I get so many compliments on them. I would recommend these to anyone looking to stretch their ears.</li>
    <li> These came really fast and the color is really nice. I just put the 14g in yesterday and I didn&#x27;t have much trouble with them. Great price too!</li>
    <li> all of them came in perfect condition the color didnt chip or fade away although it wouldve been nice if it came with a 16g</li>
    <li> It came earlier than expected and the little bags were all there and they had labels on them. I am so happy because the paint does not come off and i am currently on a 14 G. If your planning on buying a gauge kit,you should TOTALLY buy this one!!!</li>
    <li> giving this three stars because i&#x27;m missing a size 4g in my package...</li>
    <li> In love. I have had my ears pierced since I was a little girl, and decided to order this kit to start the gauging process. I read some other reviews where items were missing or out of their baggies, but mine were perfect. Definitely a bargain with no let down on quality. I have let a friend borrow some tapers and gauges and he likes them too :)</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I was expecting</li>
    <li> First time buying gauges and I really like these, they are easy to put in and comfortable. I have forgotten that I have them in.my normal earings always irritated my ears and I couldn&#x27;t sleep with them in. I also have very sensitive skin, (so I could not buy steel ones) and these have given me no issues.</li>
    <li> Worked well for me, I am also insensitive to acrylic.</li>
