### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great deal!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the perfect size for storing the cord once bundled.</li>
      <li>This holds my GHD hair straightener perfectly.</li>
      <li>and it is awesome size and quality.  </li>
      <li>So this was perfect gift.</li>
      <li>This is a great travel case for the price!  </li>
      <li>It works great and was a great price!</li>
      <li>This is a shame, would have looked great.</li>
      <li>There is nothing particularly great about it but met my expectations and works.</li>
      <li>Still a great product.</li>
      <li>This is a great item for storing curling irons, but not all curling irons.</li>
      <li>Guess that&#x27;s being kind of picky, but it would make this case perfect.  </li>
      <li>This item works great for my 1\\&quot; flatening iron.  </li>
      <li>This curling iron holder is a very nice padded and well constructed holder.  </li>
      <li>It is good for those irons/straighteners that don&#x27;t come with a travel cover.</li>
      <li>My mom loved this.</li>
      <li>, I have been very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for travelling and find it perfect for my hot iron.  </li>
      <li>The material is nice and the insulation does the job of protecting my gym bag contents.  </li>
      <li>The quality seems nice as well.</li>
      <li>I really liked the design and color of this product.</li>
      <li>The silver trim matches the color of the dryer and straightener, both of which I own, and I&#x27;m assuming the curling irons as well.</li>
      <li>The case is okay</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I purchased it</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>It fits very well and looks good too.</li>
      <li>I loved this item so much</li>
      <li>but it would have been great if the case actually fit the John Frieda flat iron that I own.</li>
      <li>I like that the case is slim, so it fits into bags easily for traveling.</li>
      <li>and I was able to pack it before it was completely cool.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit my curling iron.  </li>
      <li>It is a good compact soft case.</li>
      <li>The holder is very well made and her flat iron fits perfect in the holder.</li>
      <li>It could have been an inch or so longer as to be able to close all the way, but other than that it was really good.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that I could buy a name brand product for such a good price when I saw this.  </li>
      <li>too much cord still hanging out the top and flopping around.  </li>
      <li>I love a heat-resistant case so that I can tidy things up and put my flat iron away while it is still hot.  </li>
      <li>The purple color is also very pretty.</li>
      <li>Its perfect for my flat iron and the pouch on the outside is where the cord goes.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
      <li>I love that it has a little pocket on the back for the cord - very handy!  </li>
      <li>This is a well-made case, and it&#x27;s so useful, especially if you&#x27;re traveling and might have to put your flatiron away when it&#x27;s still warm.</li>
      <li>This case is definately worth it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These complaints are not dealbreakers and in general, I have been quite pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s a little more purple than shown in the picture, and the contrasting piping along the edges is more of a metallic silver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Works OK; however, it is just a bit too short to completely close with most modern curling irons.  </li>
      <li>Really like it and was well worth the price.</li>
      <li>It works really well in protecting my straightener, and it keeps items in my suitcase safe when I pack a hot flat iron.</li>
      <li>It seems to fully insulate my suitcase contents from my hot flat iron, and it&#x27;s actually \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; which is nice</li>
      <li>As advertised it remains cool to the touch even when the device on high which is a plus when traveling or preventing burns in general.</li>
      <li>I bought this heat proof case so I could put my straightener away while it&#x27;s still hot to prevent my young children from getting burned and not start any fires.  </li>
      <li>Decent price, and it works as designed.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I love this case for my flat iron, except the pocket on the back for the cord should be longer.  </li>
      <li>The cover works alright, but is not long enough to fit my curling iron.  </li>
      <li>What the stock pictures doesn&#x27;t show is that there is a pocket on the opposite side for the cord to be separate from your hot iron.  </li>
      <li>I wish there was a small notch at the top of the flap, to allow the cord to exit the case.  </li>
      <li>I now don&#x27;t have to worry about packing my hot flat iron into my bag.  </li>
      <li>I use it anyway and just don&#x27;t close the top, but it&#x27;s kind of annoying.</li>
      <li>She is a young adult and travels quite often.</li>
      <li>You do not have to wait for the curling iron to cool down to put it away.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly for my flat iron, but it would also work for small curling irons as well.  </li>
      <li>Several inches of the cord extends beyond the pocket, which could certainly be made long enough to accommodate the cord.  </li>
      <li>Both my wide and narrow flat irons fit into this case, individually, not at the same time.</li>

<li> Bought this recently for my Paul Mitchell flat iron.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only traveled once, but this protected my flat iron</li>
<li> This is a basic, inexpensive, heat-resistant case for a flat iron.  </li>
<li> This was a gift for a 15 yr old - and now we don&#x27;t worry about her getting burned or burning anything while the iron is cooling down.  </li>
<li> This is a must for anyone who uses curling irons or flat irons!!</li>
<li> have two minor complaints:&lt;br /&gt;(1</li>
<li> I bought a second one for my other set of irons.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s too short to hold my curling iron, which seems to be a typical length.</li>
<li> Just smaller than what I expected, so my curling iron will not fit with the flap closed.  </li>
<li> I have some of my flat iron hanging from the case causing it not to fully close which sucks and will cause me to purchase another one that fits properly.</li>
<li> Bought five other styles</li>
<li> There&#x27;s a small pocket on the back for holding the cord, and I wish this was longer, or even just replaced with a couple loops of elastic.  </li>
<li> My straightener is at least 3 inches bigger!</li>
<li> Without a notch, the cord pushes the flap over and it has to be pulled at an odd angle in order to velcro closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> (I can&#x27;t make smaller/shorter folds to help with this, because the little bundle of cords would then be too fat to slip into the pocket.)&lt;br /&gt;(2)  </li>
<li> Not a huge issue, but I do wish they made it longer.  </li>
<li> The pocket is a little small, so once I&#x27;ve folded up the cord and stuck it into the pocket, it seems like there&#x27;s always</li>
<li> Hard to find a longer one like what I once had.</li>
<li> Too bad...</li>

    <li> I loved this item so much I bought a second one for my other set of irons.  I also gave the info to my sister who purchased two of them as well.</li>
    <li> Both my wide and narrow flat irons fit into this case, individually, not at the same time. I now don&#x27;t have to worry about packing my hot flat iron into my bag.  Just put it into this case and go.</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my curling iron.  Bought another case from 31 and it is awesome size and quality.  (But WAY more expensive.)</li>
    <li> This is a basic, inexpensive, heat-resistant case for a flat iron.  I love a heat-resistant case so that I can tidy things up and put my flat iron away while it is still hot.  This one gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This case is definately worth it. As advertised it remains cool to the touch even when the device on high which is a plus when traveling or preventing burns in general. The silver trim matches the color of the dryer and straightener, both of which I own, and I&#x27;m assuming the curling irons as well. The purple color is also very pretty. BONUS: a pouch on the back of the case, which is not visible in the photo but it&#x27;s the perfect size for storing the cord once bundled. The only downside I have noticed is that only one appliance fits at a time. Still a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this heat proof case so I could put my straightener away while it&#x27;s still hot to prevent my young children from getting burned and not start any fires.  It works great and was a great price!</li>
    <li> Works OK; however, it is just a bit too short to completely close with most modern curling irons.  Too bad...</li>
    <li> My straightener is at least 3 inches bigger! This is a shame, would have looked great. I don&#x27;t recommend ppl to buy this before they measure their straightener.</li>
    <li> Just smaller than what I expected, so my curling iron will not fit with the flap closed.  Hard to find a longer one like what I once had.</li>
    <li> It is a good compact soft case. There is nothing particularly great about it but met my expectations and works.</li>
    <li> The material is nice and the insulation does the job of protecting my gym bag contents.  Only drawback is that my curling Iron handle does not fit inside the main compartment.</li>
    <li> My mom loved this. Sturdy product, she travels a lot and it hasnt worn out at all in the year she has had it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only traveled once, but this protected my flat iron and I was able to pack it before it was completely cool. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a great travel case for the price!  I&#x27;m really glad I purchased it, I have been very pleased with it.  I love that it has a little pocket on the back for the cord - very handy!  I use it mostly for my flat iron, but it would also work for small curling irons as well.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> I needed an extra case b/c my daughter took mine to college and it fits my Bablyliss or curling iron.</li>
    <li> The case is okay but it would have been great if the case actually fit the John Frieda flat iron that I own. They should have made the case in the length and size that they made their flat iron and this was the ONLY reason why I purchased the case. I have some of my flat iron hanging from the case causing it not to fully close which sucks and will cause me to purchase another one that fits properly.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a 15 yr old - and now we don&#x27;t worry about her getting burned or burning anything while the iron is cooling down.  This is a must for anyone who uses curling irons or flat irons!!</li>
    <li> This is a great item for storing curling irons, but not all curling irons. The closure tab does not cover mine. But I like that I have something to store it in. You do not have to wait for the curling iron to cool down to put it away. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this case for my flat iron, except the pocket on the back for the cord should be longer.  Several inches of the cord extends beyond the pocket, which could certainly be made long enough to accommodate the cord.  Guess that&#x27;s being kind of picky, but it would make this case perfect.  Hope the designers read this review and take it into consideration.</li>
    <li> The cover works alright, but is not long enough to fit my curling iron.  The entire iron fits in the bag, but it needs to be left open - as the flap won&#x27;t close.  Not a huge issue, but I do wish they made it longer.  Possibly there is no standard size on the length of a curling iron.</li>
    <li> This curling iron holder is a very nice padded and well constructed holder.  Really like it and was well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this holder for my teenage daughter. The holder is very well made and her flat iron fits perfect in the holder. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Its perfect for my flat iron and the pouch on the outside is where the cord goes. Bought five other styles</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and she loves it. She is a young adult and travels quite often. So this was perfect gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and she said it was just what she was looking for. Was do levered promptly as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this recently for my Paul Mitchell flat iron.  It fits very well and looks good too. Would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for travelling and find it perfect for my hot iron.  What the stock pictures doesn&#x27;t show is that there is a pocket on the opposite side for the cord to be separate from your hot iron.  The only thing I would suggest is maybe it could be another .5-1 inch taller as mine sticks out a bit.</li>
    <li> This works okay.  Doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
