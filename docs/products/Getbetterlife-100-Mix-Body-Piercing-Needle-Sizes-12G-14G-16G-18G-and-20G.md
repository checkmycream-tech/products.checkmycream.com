<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are truly amazing , they&#x27;re short and sharp so you don&#x27;t have to struggle with the initial piercing or the fact of pulling a longer needle through. Like I said they&#x27;re nice and sharp I just pierced my belly button, it was easy and painless. The package came a bit late but for the price quantity and quality it&#x27;s 100% worth it. It&#x27;s a cute little box that fits each individually wrapped needle</li>
    <li> i pierced my cartilage with a 16g, and my lip with a 14g.&lt;br /&gt;No  infections.  Fast shipping, high quality, very sharp. Came with 100 needles, 20 of each needle. (16g,14g,12g,18g,20g) Just like it said. I recommend these.</li>
    <li> They are perfect just as ordered. they are for practice piercing. I&#x27;m not using these on real people.</li>
    <li> I did my tongue belly and nipples these needles are absolutely  amazing ! Love them , they went through my skin like butter an I have a lot if scar tissue</li>
    <li> Alot of pre sterilized needles. I dont know if it&#x27;s 100, i dont feel like counting them, but i trust you. Good buy!</li>
    <li> Happy i recived it within one day perfecty came in mail safly just perfect  same as picture  lovely adore love</li>
    <li> These gave me so much life. They&#x27;re all in little sterized indivually sealed packs. And each size is separated into bags. I love them. They&#x27;re metal hallow needles. I Peirced my ears with them and they healed nicely!! I love love love these!! I gave a few to my friend and she pierced her nipples and she said that worked out nicely too :) when I run out I&#x27;m coming back for more!!!</li>
    <li> Their really helpful and really sharp I didn&#x27;t feel a thing when I pierced myself !</li>
    <li> Good quality. Very sharp! Worked so much better than the needles included in a piercing kit sold by another company. These move through tissue smoothly.</li>
    <li> Shipment came on time, and I got Tue exact amount of needles specified. They are all sterile, and hollow, perfect for piercings, and super sharp, too. I&#x27;m extremely happy with them, and ill definitely be ordering them again</li>
    <li> all the sizes are quite funky and i find i have to go down (if i normally use an 20 i would have to use an 18 or 16) because they are smaller than normal sizes. but other than that i had no problem with them</li>
    <li> Lasted me awhile. STILL have some after ordering almost a year ago... Depends on how many piercings you do though..</li>
    <li> I love these so much I piercied my nose, cartilage, and my brothers ears with these. They slide in real easy and the hollow part is super helpful</li>
    <li> rally nice nothing to complain they are sharp and what they where told they are</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and expected.</li>
    <li> All product was here. Sterilized.</li>
    <li> Sharp. Gets the job done. I&#x27;ve done 2 piercings with them So far. Will order them again.</li>
    <li> They will put holes in you according to size selected. Pretty simple.</li>
    <li> I bought these to pierce my septum and sell some. They were all there within a day of ordering and they are completely sterile. These needles are quality and I have done 16 total piercings with them!</li>
    <li> I bought this basically for myself and for the few friends I will pierce. The needles are great quality and I have done 2 industrials, forward helix, 6 lodes, a tragus, and two cartilage piercings with them. They are good quality and I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> these needles work perfectly ! ! everything is there! the price is amazing for 100 needles! they are packaged neatly</li>
    <li> I got all of the needles it said in the description. I&#x27;ve already used two and they worked very smoothly! I love these, deff buying again in the future. They&#x27;re so cheap too!</li>
    <li> Perfectly and professionally packaged. All the needles have guards on them and are sealed perfectly. Great set for a great price to use on client or if your supply is running low and you need more needles fast.</li>
    <li> i received the package today. The description matched the product completely. The needles came each individually wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day I got them my buddy pierced my eye brow and was very easy as they are extremely sharp went straight threw with no issues. Since the end of the needle is hollow its easy to get the hoop ring threw the hole just made with the needle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get 100 mixed needles in the pack with 20 of each size  12G 14G, 16G, 18G and 20G.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are made of high quality and work very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anybody looking to do a piercing on them self or looking to reopen a previous piecing. Great price and product and shipping was fast .</li>
    <li> I got equal amount of every gage. Very sharp and work great which means pain is minimal.</li>
    <li> Omg these needles are super sharp, was halfway through before i even realized it! Sterile packaging, good n hollow. Best product and best price 10/10</li>
    <li> Had my friend (who is an acupuncturist and familiar with sterile technique) pierce my ears four times with these needles. Each one was close to painless, accurate, and healed easily. Great deal, good buy, excellent product.</li>
    <li> I received my order of 100 needles in the maik early - so I&#x27;ll give credit for that, even though it still took 2 weeks and there weren&#x27;t any options on the type of shipping for some reason. When I opened my order, I founf that alot of the \\&quot;sterile\\&quot; packs were half open - not so sure if its the texas heat ruining the glue or not. Othere than that, the piercing needles that I can use are very sufficient.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for personal use. My daughter pierced my ear for me with these and it was hardly any pain nor bleeding. These needles are very sharp so for a bout a half second you feel this prick and it&#x27;s done. My earlobes are a little thick and they went in like a knife trough soft butter. The price is phenomenal!!</li>
    <li> These needles are very sharp and easy to pierce with, great deal!&lt;br /&gt;The things on the end are not only hard to get off,  but not Sage to put back on while you&#x27;re piercing someone, I think these should come with quarks just for safety</li>
    <li> Super happy with these needles. They came early and they&#x27;re all still in the packaging, no open ones or anything and everything is accounted for and I even got a little extra. I&#x27;m excited to use them and I definitely will be buying from here again.</li>
    <li> needles are sharp and arrived sealed (unlike other posters all mine  arrived with seals intact) i will recomend these to my friends</li>
    <li> I received this product in great time everything on the inside of the box was sealed very nicely. The box everything was in was smashed in but I am still very pleased with the product :)</li>
    <li> The needles were organized nicely in baggies, but they were not sealed, so they were not sterile by the time they arrived. I used them anyway, and got an infection in my ears, but not my tragus or septum.</li>
    <li> still have some and use them they are great</li>
    <li> have bought this product several times because i am so pleased. they are good quality, good packaging and at a great price! i love them</li>
    <li> &#x27;arrived on time, great assortment</li>
    <li> they are great needles i definitely will order more!&lt;br /&gt; i would have given 5 stars but 6 needles were already open</li>
    <li> it was excatly what they said that it was going to be. i dont have any complants. this was a great product</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time but packaging contained only gauges 12-16.&lt;br /&gt; ****RECIEVED NO 18 OR 20 GAUGE****&lt;br /&gt;I tried contacting the seller before purchase upon seeing other reviews stating this happening too as to make sure there would not be a mix up and it still came all mixed up. The needles are very sharp and a very nice quality but I won&#x27;t use the larger gauges so it seems kinda useless to me at this point.</li>
    <li> The needles got to my house in a rather on-point manner, as well as, all individually isolated in their own packaging. Perhaps the only down side is that I was unable to find any 20g needles. Not too concerned about the absence of the 20g; I will use the 18g instead, or special order the 20g else wise.&lt;br /&gt;[Five needles per set.]&lt;br /&gt;18g- five sets of five. (25 needles)&lt;br /&gt;16g- five sets of five. (25 needles)&lt;br /&gt;14g- five sets of five. (25 needles)&lt;br /&gt;12g- five sets of five. (25 needles) &#x3D; 100 needles.</li>
    <li> Not much I can say about these needles.. I mean they&#x27;re nice and sharp they go through skin really good I mean there&#x27;s noodles...lol works great</li>
    <li> I ordered the needles on late Sunday evening and received them on Wednesday. I got them pretty quick which was good! I love the needles, there are so many and I am very pleased. It is affordable too for getting 100 needles! Total recommend!!</li>
    <li> Needles were great, very high quality, but very disappointed because I did not receive any 12g needles. Which are the needles I use the most, and are mentioned in the description, , for bellys and tongues. I only got ten 14g, and mostly nothing but 16g,18g, and 20g.</li>
    <li> I received 25/25/25/25 of 12-18g needles, opposed to the 20/20/20/20/20 of 12-20g I expected. I thought it would have been more prudent of the seller to send me a message letting me know I wasn&#x27;t getting any 20g needles, rather than to find out once I got the needles and discovered there were none. At the time I was down to 5 20g needles in my stock and had I known earlier, I could have made a more timely accomidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Good product, inadaquate customer service.</li>
    <li> I use these for there guages to wrap micro &amp; nano coils for my vaping coils. Add some cork &amp; your covered. Way cheaper than drill bits. And enough to share!</li>
    <li> This product is factastic I placed my order at 7:56 pm Nov 21 and recieved it 1:54 Nov 22 amazing they work so good cant wait to pierce everything.....  The only problem is there were no 20G but i didn&#x27;t plan on using them so otger then that its perfect. I could not wait to get these and now I will definately buy more :D best buyer ever Im glad I ignored the bad reviews. Will be back really soon.</li>
    <li> shipping to awhile and the needles are alright</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried because of the reviews that said the needles came and the packages were open so they had to throw some away, but when I got them today the box was in perfect condition and none were open. I got 20g 18g 16g, 14g and 12g all in perfect condition. I am extremely pleased with this purchase. If you are looking for needles at a great price, buy these!</li>
    <li> Came perfect, very sharp and correct amounts of correct sizes. Amazed at how they fitted into the small box they sent it in though. Once I took them out to count them, I couldn&#x27;t fit them all back in.</li>
    <li> Needles were individually sealed and sterile. Very sharp and did exactly what they were meant to do. I would definatly buy again. There is a good amount of each size.</li>
    <li> They arrived early and everything was just as the description said. They aren&#x27;t as long as needles I have used before which was odd but it doesn&#x27;t matter at all. I am very happy and plan to use a few tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I purchased these over a year ago I am now down to a few of the 16 gauge and a few of the 18 gauge. I will be placing another order because I am so satisfied with the items that were received. They came quickly, individually packed and ready to go... couldn&#x27;t ask for anything simpler.. I also love that I&#x27;m able to email the seller and request what sizes I would like sent to me.</li>
    <li> Great price for needles and a variety of sizes. We use these all the time for piercings and haven&#x27;t run into any problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Needles are not accurate. They are a size smaller than the actual said size. I don&#x27;t have time to return them and so I just used them.</li>
    <li> I received no 20g or 18g needles which is what I really needed instead I got 50 12g, 25 14g, and 25 16g. Really disappointing that some people can&#x27;t count, and we can&#x27;t count on places to come through with the full description of their product. Customer satisfaction is NOT their main priority IMHO.</li>
    <li> I got everything they said I would and already went through with a few piercings. The only thing I would have like is if they were a little sharper but overall I&#x27;d definatly buy them again.</li>
    <li> These needles are so sharp, there are so many, and they just work really well. I love them, I&#x27;ve pierced around 5 people with these, and it was so quick because of the quality of needles.Shipping is also very fast.  GREAT BUY!!</li>
    <li> Great sharp and perfect for what was needed. Great sizes everything was perfect</li>
    <li> Great to have a lot of needles to choose from.I would recommend this product.Great to have the different sizes so check them out</li>
    <li> Who can&#x27;t love a bunch of needles to pierce with?! These are all individually wrapped and ready to go! I like the different sizes. Although, I didn&#x27;t the exact sizes listed.... (I&#x27;ve never seen a 15g.... or jewelry for it) But i&#x27;m sure I can use them all somehow! (:</li>
    <li> Everything came as expected and i look forward to more sales from you i wiould recomend you to anyone great</li>
    <li> Amazing quality! Easy to use and each size was there as it says. 20 each. Seller communication was quick and friendly. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Thank you very much, this is exactly what I needed! I look forward to purchasing more items from you in the future!</li>
    <li> Everything came as described. Way worth the price. I would have given 5 stars but the packaging is kind of  poor.</li>
    <li> I didnt even think to count if i got all the needles that it says comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;But i just want to know, since the products coming from China out of all places that if&lt;br /&gt;theyre guaranteed to be sterilized correctly. Like, how do i find this information out?</li>
    <li> omg they got here yesterday and I pierced my ear 😷 and sum other parts. it came with everything. I actually expected this next week not in the same week love it really sharp. good packaging. really fast shipping. and cheap.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Shipping was fast and it came packaged nice and neat. The needles are very sharp and must use with caution. I love them lots and I will buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product? Absolutely Yes!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what others were saying about not getting the right amount or whatever. But I got all of the needles I paid for, the only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because I though the packaging could have been a tiny bit better, but over all I would definitely buy these again!!!! (:</li>
    <li> All I got were 20 guage needles and it said would get different sizes I am very upset and for some reason I can not figure out how to contact the seller! I love the needles and how sharp and clean they are but I would like to have what was said above. How do I get ahold of them?????!!!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says you will get.. pierced my nose tragus and industrial</li>
    <li> I love these needles! I ordered them 3 days ago, they were supposed to get here today, but they came in yesterday. About an hour ago I double pierced both of my ears with them. They went through the skin very easily. All the needles are individually packaged with the expiration date and gauge size on the back. There was exactly 100 needles and exactly 20 of each size. I would definitely recommend them to anyone!</li>
    <li> These needles are of good quality, individually packaged and sterile. No problems here and can&#x27;t beat the price! I recommend this purchase. Please pierce responsibly.</li>
    <li> I received the needles very quickly, but I only received 12G, 14G and 16G - no 18G or 20G as advertised.  The 16G needle I used worked well and was sealed well.  I didn&#x27;t count the needles as they were packed like sardines in a very small box, but I&#x27;d guess there to be 100.  I could have given them 5 stars if I&#x27;d gotten what was advertised.  By the looks of the reviews they apparently don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> missing the 18 and 20gauge needles in the box, came with plenty of 12-16 gauge though. Unfortunately for me I especially ordered this particular one because I need the 18 and 20 gauge needles and could use a few more of the other. Not sure if I will be ordering again from this false advertisement. needles did come on time and individually packaged and sterilized if that&#x27;s any consolation.</li>
    <li> came great love it all 100 peices came</li>
    <li> I love these! They came individually packaged and I got the perfect amount of each needle as promised. They are super sharp and go right through all the piercings I have done. You will not be dissatisfied!</li>
    <li> These are sharp and sterile , and individually packaged which makes peircing really easy</li>
    <li> More than half where opened had to throw them away I was not satisfied with this product at all! Don&#x27;t buy!!!!</li>
    <li> there brand new. then work awesome.  i even pierced myself an it went right in.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a great buy. i give it 110%</li>
    <li> Perfect variety size gauges for entire body piercing.</li>
    <li> For the price they&#x27;re amazing. They&#x27;re really sharp and glide right through. I do professional piercings and love these. I highly recommend these for pros and beginners! Shipping is a little slow for people in Illinois.</li>
    <li> I ordered these on Wednesday, December 13th, and received them in my mailbox today (Friday, December 14th).&lt;br /&gt;The needles are sorted by size, and are individually packaged. These are in great quality,  and they are also very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;If I could give a 10 star rating, I would. 👍</li>
    <li> I loved it all, i pierced my monroe and bellybutton and it went through smooth and easy, gets past scar tissue very well too! I highly reccomend these! :) not to mention it shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Just got it and it has all the sizes it says vary good! Excited to use!</li>
    <li> Very awesome got twenty of each of the sizes very sharp came sterilized and packaged seperately.  Also came before i wd told they would i would defiantly buy again !five stars and would recommend.  100 Piercing needles for six dollars is an amazing deal</li>
    <li> came great love it all 100 peices came</li>
    <li> I highly recomend these needles. I actually bought two packs because I do quite a bit of piercings, for myself and others. The needles are very sharp and go through easy. I got exactly 100 (20 for each gauge size) for both of my orders. These needles are great.&lt;br /&gt;A little disclaimer, if you&#x27;re going to pierce yourself, please do as much research as you can on the piercing. I do not recomend piercing your tongue, or someone else&#x27;s. There&#x27;s a huge risk for tongue piercings and it&#x27;s much better to go to a professional. You can wait, trust me. It&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great needles. If you&#x27;re worried about not getting all the sizes you want, I recomend sending a message to the seller.&lt;br /&gt;These needles are great and definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> well made sharp and on time delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own piercings for years now, but when shops in my town stopped selling hollow point needles I was heartbroken. Found these and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. Each needle is individually wrapped, sterile, and stamped with the expiration date. They also have small foam caps at the tip of each needle to preserve the point, making these extremely sharp. I just did my own nose piercing and vertical labret, and I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a sharper needle. I didn&#x27;t receive any 20 gauge needles in the pack, but I wouldn&#x27;t have used them anyway, so I was totally fine with that, but if you are needing 20 gauge needles, be sure to contact the seller and let them know. I would highly recommend these and will purchase again if I ever run out.</li>
    <li> These are great! Came with all sizes and came earlier than I thought! Will come back for more, and i recommend these for any piercing!</li>
    <li> These needles are great. They&#x27;re individually packaged and e.o gas sterilized. When i bought these they were sent out very fast. None poked through (like when you buy from some people) and there was the right amount of everything. I gave it a 5 star rating because of the fast shipping and great quality of the needles. I would deffinatly reccomend buying from. I plan to buy more when i run out of these ones :]</li>
    <li> Kelp me updated, it came here before time,and it was everything I expected. This is better then ebay to me</li>
    <li> Arrived a day early, which is always a great surprise. All 100 needles were there, and they were separated into baggies according to size. Each needle was in a sealed, sterilized package. So far have used two 14g needles; they were very sharp and worked well without any problems. I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Great needles, very sharp. everything was there 20 of each needle. This product even arrived early which was great! I&#x27;ll defiently be going through this company in the future. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> so clean love em thanx there so awesome and sharp</li>
    <li> Was just as described, shipped in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> These are great, they came early, in a little box with each needle individually packaged, and all the separate sizes in separate bags.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them to pierce my nose, my industrial, and my boyfriends ears. They&#x27;re very very sharp, so KNOW WHAT YOU&#x27;RE DOING! These aren&#x27;t for &amp;#34;just anyone&amp;#34; to handle, and you need to keep everything sterile.&lt;br /&gt;But overall, these do exactly what their supposed to.</li>
    <li> Super pleased! Gott them a whole day early! Which took me by surprise. The needles are very sharp and easy to Pierce through skin used 3 on me and 6 on my family and friends! So much cheaper than paying 15+ at tattoo place, claires, Walmart, act...gonna buy more!</li>
    <li> I used these for my septum and they worked very well. They are very sharp and pierce the skin very easily.</li>
    <li> Good quality needles only one out of its packaging. very sharp and east to pierce with. nothing has been infected</li>
    <li> Amazing. I got exactly what I want and within a week of ordering them. You guys do a great job. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Worn packaging.  Felt not so sterile.</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price. Came with everything it said.</li>
    <li> It said it was a mixed lot, took forever to get here, then all thats was in the box was 2og needles! so upset!</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I paid for!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought these. I got exactly what I was told I was going to get. And they were delivered to my door much quicker than expected. I&#x27;m very happy with this buy. All 100 needles are wrapped individually and each have safety protectors on the sharp end. I will be a return customer :)</li>
    <li> Quality is good, but  when I tried to request specific size needles with my order I was told that they couldn&#x27;t do that because I had ordered using Amazon Prime. So if you want something different than the exact description don&#x27;t use Prime</li>
    <li> I enjoy them very much. (:</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re indeed legit! If you are thinking of getting them, do it! And at a great price and quantity size!</li>
    <li> Awesome price! Quick delivery! Great Quality!</li>
    <li> Best Package yet. Worth it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these, they came early, there professional grade, and extremely sharp. Perfect</li>
    <li> Will only buy this one from now on ....got what it said and high quality the best  shipping was great too great price for all the needles.</li>
    <li> Alot of product for the price</li>
    <li> I ordered these but it says its 100 mix neddled but it isnt. I like the ones I got. Very sharp too. They were alright.</li>
    <li> I got everything it said it would which is, 20 20g , 20 18g, 20 16g, 20 14g, 20 16. And I use them to pierce my friends ear and on myself. This is really cheap and real good. I will deff buy again from here(: You should order</li>
    <li> I pierced myself three times with these needles. Twice with the 16g for my ear lobes, and once with the 14g for my septum. All turned out great, they never got infect, and I hardly felt the needles go through any of the piercing.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Do it. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Great! Just as expected.</li>
    <li> Works great super sharp</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I wish i could switch out the 12 gauge to a 16 or 18. Is that possible.</li>
    <li> Nice variety. quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I received NO 18g and NO 20g needles ): those where the ones we needed most... Shipping was quick and we got the 100 needles in each box but again only 3 sizes ):</li>
    <li> All of the needles were 14 gauge. I tried to contact the seller about it &amp; they never replied to me. My advice would be just order from someone else. What am I supposed to do with 100 14 gauge needles?? It was just a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the extremely fast delivery and the quality of the product.  i can honestly say i dont dread the next time i have to restock!</li>
    <li> item came ahead of time, was exactly as described and i got an even mix of all types of needles. awesome buy! thanks so much guys</li>
    <li> PERFECT&lt;br /&gt;ordering from here forever!</li>
    <li> They were very sharp which was great. and can tell it was sterile just packaging is sketchy and they  can fall out of there individual packaging.</li>
    <li> got these so i would be able to continue piercing my friends, quantity is great, no problem with the metal material!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item, and received exactly what I wanted and expected. Every size was there, exactly how they described. None of the packages were opened. I&#x27;ve already done 5 piercings with these, and they&#x27;ve all been very clean and sharp. The needle went in and out perfectly. Anyone complaining about infected piercings probably are just not cleaning it appropriately. None of the ones I&#x27;ve done have been infected, and are healing quite quickly.</li>
    <li> I got this within 2 days which is pretty fast. I counted the needles and I only received 95 and still didnt get any 20g. Mostly 12g.. im still happy with the purchase though.</li>
    <li> Only got 12g 16g 20g, not all 5 sizes. hopefully they can fix my problem, and i can get those too.</li>
    <li> Needles came individually wrapped with the gauge clearly marked on each one. Each needle has a plastic protectiv piece over the sharp end for safety as well. Have used 5 of the 12 gauge needles so far and they have all been perfect so far.</li>
    <li> Super fast getting here and there perfect love them &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> pierce very well. would recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a great set of needle that will cover pretty much all of your piecing needs.  I bought this to do an industrial piercing at home and these needles worked great. They come sterile and individually packed. They are two inches long and very sharp.</li>
    <li> I asked to swap out some needle sizes but I got them in all sizes regardless but all in all they work and were all there.</li>
    <li> While marked &amp;#34;sterile&amp;#34;, the 20g needles I received had the backing peeling off of the packaging (think an old bandaid wrapper). The rest seem ok &amp; they&#x27;re super sharp .</li>
    <li> They worked great. Everything as described I will be ordering more soon. Worth every cent I payed. I am very happy with this</li>
    <li> Exactly as described except a few seals were broken.</li>
    <li> Arrived in 2 days, which was great because I wanted to use them right away.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them to do a septum piercing and they worked very well. I used a 16g and the pain was minimal.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use them for other piercings.</li>
    <li> I got all 100 in all the sizes they said they&#x27;d be in! They work great very sharp and I&#x27;ve had no problem with infections at all but just a little warning to everyone just because the needle is steralized doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t make sure you&#x27;re in a sterile environment and properly clean and steralized everything you use</li>
    <li> These needles are great. They&#x27;re incredibly sharp and all are individually wrapped, with a stopper at the tip of the needle. Great quality, great price. I am impressed. I&#x27;ve ordered from them twice and they even customized my order no problem. If you&#x27;re looking to buy needles for a great price then look no further!</li>
    <li> These needles were super sharp witch was great they didn&#x27;t even hurt. All the sizes were there 20g,18g,16g, and 14g. I&#x27;m just a little concerned with the sterilization. It says they&#x27;re e.o. Gas Sterilized but they&#x27;re past expiration on some of them so I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;re still okay though  &gt;.&gt;;</li>
    <li> All 100 needles were there and each labeled in their own bag. They were very sharp and easy to use. I will definitly get some more from ohere.</li>
    <li> a very good deal on piercing needles,&lt;br /&gt;perfect variety of sizes,&lt;br /&gt;i would purchase again if i ever ran out!&lt;br /&gt;i will probably use like 15/100 of these but it&#x27;s still worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product everything is accounted for. Packaged great no damage at all, shipping was quick. They&#x27;re sharp and get the job done smooth an quick no problems here, great for the price. I recommend this product to everyone....</li>
    <li> Ive pierced my ears about 4 times with these they are very good piercing needles and for a good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been accumulating Needles and supplies for my decision to become a &amp;#34;Journeyman&amp;#34; free lance Piercer and Tattoo artist (usually within my &amp;#34;family&amp;#34; of active and retired FD members) and also to help out my friend, a fellow retiree from the Department, with his small business, for the times when he has to take his invalid wife to the Doctor&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus to also learn a new trade, to supplement my pension income in retirement, and since I have numerous medical training, especially in sterile and aseptic techniques, it seemed logical to get into this line of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, in closing, I received these items fairly quickly and they were packaged VERY well, as usual, thank you, Amazon, for another satisfied customer!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent price for everything you get, sterile in individual wrappers.</li>
    <li> Love that I get so many for really good deal. This is the most needles for the cheapest price I could find-nice. I dig it, and the shipment really quick with it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. 20 of each size (20, 18, 16, 14, and 12), each size individually packaged in a small zip up baggie, all sterilized.</li>
    <li> This are very nice!! i actually didnt know what to think when i saw that all the needles are in order and separated.&lt;br /&gt;i was thinking just something in a bag with hard to touch needles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all good I love everything I got it is all there just what I ask for thank you I will be back soon</li>
    <li> I ordered these on the 2nd and received them on the 4th; two days before expected. I was thrown off by the box that said &amp;#34;18G&amp;#34;, but once I opened them it was exactly right. They&#x27;re packed and ready for use! I haven&#x27;t used any yet, but I definitely plan on it. c:&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend!</li>
    <li> This item is fantastic! I pierced my medusa with these and I didn&#x27;t even feel the needle go through!&lt;br /&gt;Only one con that im not sure if it was just a mistake or this discription is wrong: it states that you get 20 of each five sizes of 12g 14g 16g 18g and 20g. I did not recieve the 20g needles, instead i recieved an extra 20 18g. I probably would have never used the 20g anyway though.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I will definantly be buying these again!!</li>
    <li> These needles were perfect. They came on time, exactly as described for a great price. I definetely reccomend these needles to those who are looking!</li>
    <li> i love them, they all come individually packaged and i received all five sizes. very sharp and each one sterilized inside its package.</li>
    <li> Good needles all sealed and sterile</li>
    <li> They work great. Nice and sharp. Packaged separately.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a 20 pack of 14g needles. Those were twice as much as this, and it came with less. THIS is a GREAT deal!!!! I really like how it came with sizes 20g-12g!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Although, if you&#x27;re planning on keeping the box it comes in it will be hard.&lt;br /&gt;My package came four days early, in witch I was very happy about. The needles are great but the box it had come in ripped fairly easy.</li>
    <li> super convenient to have a mixed gauge supply, great product</li>
    <li> loved having these to pierce my nose, but i found it very difficult to get the jewelry in with these needles..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with these nice sharp needles. They are individually packaged to keep them sterile and five needles of the same size are attached together. Altogether you get twenty of each size which will last me a very long time. I suggest finding a way to organize the needle sizes and ditching the little box they come in because it can be a pain finding the exact needle you need. I&#x27;m planning on buying a small plastic drawer set like you see on office desks to organize mine. Also, care should be taken when opening a needle as some of them naturally came loose of the plastic piece that keeps the very sharp needle tip covered.</li>
    <li> Packaged well. Got here fast. Contained what was advertised.will be coming back anytime I need more of this item. Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> It comes with plenty of each size and they have a ball at the end so I don&#x27;t prick anything until I am ready to pierce. They move through flesh very easy.</li>
    <li> They are exactly what I expected, the needles work great.</li>
    <li> Thank you very persise</li>
    <li> First off, I didn&#x27;t receive the first set of needles that I had bought. Secondly, there were only two sizes out of the whole 100 pack. I will definitely think twice before buying something like this again.</li>
    <li> They are the best! I love them to death! I bought 400 for less than $30 WORTH THE MONEY!!!!</li>
    <li> The needles came almost a MONTH BEFORE they were supposed to arrive. They however did not come in the packaging I expected, but each needle is still individually packaged and sealed, as well as being grouped together by size. Overall very satisfied and would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t all that sure about ordering these piercing needles after reading the reviews but I did anyway. I made a great choice. They arrived within days of ordering them. They also came as desceibed. Each needle came woth the correct amount. I used them today amd they were great. I barely pressed on my skin while trying to line it up and it pierced the skin. I was impressed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase! An amazing price for such a great product. They are individually packaged and labeled by size. I recommend this set of needles to anyone who wants good needles for a small price. Only thing wrong is that the description says it also has 20g needles but I did not receive any and instead got another pack of each of the sizes. For me this is not a problem, a bonus actually because I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve been needing the 20g needles.</li>
    <li> All the needles were properly sealed in their medical packaging and free from defect. For the price, I will definitely continue to restock with this seller.</li>
    <li> I ordered these a few months ago and I love them! Everything was there and they are perfect for self piercing! I&#x27;ve pierced my ears and nose with these and I love them! Now I don&#x27;t have to spend a bunch of money for someone else to do it, because I can myself. there&#x27;s A LOT of needles that I know I&#x27;m not going to use, so I&#x27;m making money by selling some to other people and doing others piercings. it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> These are neatly packaged, clearly labeled, and exactly what I was thinking of. They are easy to use for piercings and with a good pair of clamps, work perfectly. They are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re Great, All Individually Packaged, 100 Needles Sizes 12-20 Just As Described. All I Can Say Is, \\&quot;Great Buy, At A Greater Price(:\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really great at the price, but the thing is I ordered this specifically for the 18g and 20g needles. I instead recieved two sets of 14g and 16g and one 12g, but you can&#x27;t beat the price, Other than that I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> There were no 20g or 14g needles, but other than that this product is good. Needles are very sharp, and all the piercings I&#x27;ve done have come out perfect. Please make sure you don&#x27;t forget to put the 14g and the 20g needles in with the pack the next time I order these!!</li>
    <li> So the needles themselves are great: very sharp and come in individual packages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I got a ton of 12g, 14g, and 16g. No 18&#x27;s or 20&#x27;s, which was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Sterile &amp; sharp, perfect for any piercing need. But you need to make sure you use the next size up from the jewelry you are using for it to fit in the hole (ex. put the 12G needle for a 14G piece of jewelery).</li>
    <li> I bought these needles and I was using the shops needles as well. I preferred these ones because they were smoother and easier to push into the skin. The only down side is that a majority of the time your not using 12G needles so I have a bunch of them and ran out of my 16G and 14G&#x27;s</li>
    <li> i have pierced my ears with these needles 6 times already and they work really well and no infections. i also pierced my cousin 3 times using these needles. they are very sharp and easy to pierce with. its also great that there are so many :D</li>
    <li> this came with everything but not the 18g. i realy needed htem. but other wise its good and worth it</li>
    <li> these give u infections.... iWudnt suqqest them to NOONE:) iUsed about 7 needles an each one got an infecti0n. iUsed difreent ones and no infection,.. haaa</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for the price.  My only complaint is that they got the order wrong and sent me 25 of each 18G - 12G and didn&#x27;t include any 20G.  I&#x27;m hoping this was a 1-time mistake because I do plan to re-order here also...</li>
    <li> really sharp and sterile only use if you know what you are doing i like that there is a variety of different sizes</li>
    <li> Received the product quickly, and the content is as described. Good quality product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Came with every guage love the product.... its a must have and comes n guages 12, 14, 16 and 18</li>
    <li> They are really sharp! I used the 18g like four times, they didn&#x27;t hurt that bad. hvh vhv  uvh f</li>
    <li> This product was great. It was just what I was looking for... I pierced my own nose and they were already sterilized and all in separate packages so it was great and really easy. There are 100 needles, sizes 22-12 I think.... Or maybe 20-12 gauge. But when I pierced my nose, the needle is so sharp, so it just slid right through, and obviously it hurt a little cause it&#x27;s going to no matter what you do it with, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all and it was really easy especially with these needles and the hollow open ends cause you can just stick the ring right in. I also pierced my ears with them and there was no pain at all. This product is awesome and a great deal!</li>
    <li> when i recieved this package it was everything I expected it to be. I would definitely order from this seller again</li>
    <li> Wonderful piercing tools. Great selection of sizes. Very sanitary. Smooth to use!</li>
    <li> its very good and sharp</li>
    <li> just as the ad says :D&lt;br /&gt;100 needles, 20 of each size&lt;br /&gt;nice and sturdy&lt;br /&gt;perfectly made&lt;br /&gt;perfect for piercings, please only use if you know what you are doing :)</li>
    <li> it came in earlier than i thought. shipped very nicely and it was all there. very satisfied with my product</li>
    <li> great!! did many piercings :)</li>
    <li> Great Price for the Amount Paid.&lt;br /&gt;The item was NOT as decribed.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt get 12G, 14G, 16G, 18G and 20G&lt;br /&gt;I ONLY Got 14G, 14G, 16G, 16G and 12 G</li>
    <li> This product is Awesome. Every needle is perfect. I have used a few already and would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> i love these needles. ive only had them for 1 day and ive already used 3 of them. they are extremely sharp so they pierce skin very well. they are indivually packaged and they came in sets of 20. evenly divided by size .</li>
    <li> This product is perfect!! 100 needles all diff sizes!! Definitely will be buying more!</li>
    <li> All labeled in neat bags and came very fast, I ordered on a tuesday, and came on friday. Already pierced my bellybutton and it went through easily and less painful than I expected.</li>
    <li> The shipping took forever &amp; it was only coming from a state over. Also, the needles look old. Not sure if they are sterile or not.</li>
    <li> The box was beat up, and opened, when i took needles out of the box, 20 needles fell out of the packages, were not sealed, so they were not clean.</li>
    <li> I went on a piercing rampage! Very good quality.I had no trouble at all. The variety of sizes is awesome and its so worth the price! Pierced my septum and my husbands septum without any problems and it was waaaay cheaper than going to a shop go get it done!</li>
    <li> Dull, not good for piercing</li>
    <li> Best way to get piercing needles</li>
    <li> Does what it was designed to do.</li>
    <li> they work pretty well. the only thing i have negative  to say about them is they did not send me 100 needle, but  a 50 piece pack instead</li>
    <li> Great product and supplier was great, everything is exactly as described and got here(on the opposite coast of the country) Very Quickly,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
    <li> The needles are very sharp and good, but I only got 12g 14g 18g and 20g. Won&#x27;t be buying from these people anymore.</li>
    <li> Pretty good variety! Had varied amounts per size but pretty even distribution. Would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> Arrived fast! I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> These turned out to be just what I wanted and was expecting. All individually wrapped, everything was there and they go through like butter. Can&#x27;t think of one bad thing to say!!</li>
    <li> I was so happy when these came in the mail! They were early, and to my surprise they were wrapped and sanitized individually. I was super happy with this purchase, and I got exactly one hundred. Will be coming back for more!</li>
    <li> Came how it was supposed 2  very nice needles</li>
    <li> These needles came in nice sterilized packages, all separated by gauge size. I was very pleased with them especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Arrived slightly late. Great quality. All individually sterile packages, all labeled. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> they work like needles at a great price</li>
    <li> I really only needed a couple of needles but the price was right and I was able to re-pierce my ear no problem.  These are great quality, individually packaged and the sizes are marked on the back.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Love love love them!! Absolutely perfect for what I was looking for. Just as the ad says- all 100 needles with the same amount of 5 different sizes. Very sharp, and even goes through scar tissue! They are all individually wrapped. The only problem was 4 of the needles were wrapped weird so air could&#x27;ve hit them but it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Deff recommend. Will be ordering again:)</li>
    <li> 100 Deffinatly came in the package , very sharp  , sterilized of course . The only thing needed to be watched out for is some of the needles may be torn open , (I found about 4). Overall , these are fine .</li>
    <li> sterilized about a month before i bought it and will remain sterile for couple years&lt;br /&gt;not as pointy as monster point brand but for some reason it seems to be much much sharper and pierce better than the monster point brand i will be buying from this seller again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why most people said they didnt recieve all of what they were supposed to or tons of the same size. My order came perfectly as described and I&#x27;m very very pleased with the quality of the needles. They are super sharp and DO come in the sizes specified. Yay :)</li>
    <li> extremely sharp  easy to use. had other people tell me it hurts to have your foreskin pierced i did this my self and was quick and almost painless with this product. FYI i used a 12 gauge needle. NO TEARS HERE!!</li>
    <li> Everything is sealed tight and clean. Very goof quality and shipped on time.</li>
    <li> The needles were shipped faster than expected (which was a good thing) and were great. I&#x27;ve used only the 12 g so far and it worked perfectly as it should have and my ears have not been infected by use of it.</li>
    <li> sharp as hell, 20 of each. 20, 18, 16, 14, and 12</li>
    <li> Perfect and great price!</li>
    <li> All the needles came in individual sterilized packages, were very sharp and the package was shipped really fast. Used them to pierce my ears with no problems at all.</li>
    <li> Came early! Good quality</li>
    <li> needles seem to be dull.</li>
    <li> they work well, but there were more 20 gauge needles than anything.</li>
    <li> Very happy I could find Body Piercing Needles in different sizes that are made in the USA! Very Happy with this.</li>
    <li> For 7$ they are definitely worth it. Do a great job! Pierced my ears and some of my buddies septums. I got all 99 needles rather than 100, and around 6 needles packaging was damaged and had to be thrown out. But for 7$, 93 needles is a great price. And they are good quality. Got all of the different sizes, too.</li>
    <li> These needles work great. My friends and I have used them to pierce multiples piercings and they work just like a professionals. From cartilage, to belly button, none of the piercings have gotten infected and we&#x27;ve saved tons of money by using these. LOVE THEM!</li>
