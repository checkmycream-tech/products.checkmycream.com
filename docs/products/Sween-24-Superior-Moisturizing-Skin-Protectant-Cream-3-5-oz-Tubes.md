      <li>Love this cream.</li>
      <li>Love this cream.</li>
      <li>you want to use it more.</li>
      <li>I describe its texture as more of silky gel feel.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for dry feet....</li>
      <li>This cream is the best that I have found for my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>It is the BEST lotion for severely dry, cracked and bleeding hands and feet!  </li>
      <li>Good for the whole family</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and it applies and absorbs into the skin.  </li>
      <li>However, I was sent a huge tube instead of 3 five oz tubes and promoted.</li>
      <li>Great for medical professionals that always wash their hands.</li>
      <li>I learned about Sween 24 Superior Moisturizing Skin Protectant Cream -- Coloplast--from an LPN at the assisted living care facility where my 93 year old aunt resides.  </li>
      <li>Sween 24 is great for moisturizing very dry skin</li>
      <li>though I love this cream, I paid for three 5oz tubes and only received one, I&#x27;m sure one 5oz tube does not cost $23.00</li>
      <li>I love this cream, it has helped my exema more than any other non perscription cream available.</li>
      <li>This product works wonderfully to provide long lasting moisture for my skin.</li>
      <li>I can use the Sween at work and it will completely be absorbed ito my skin.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as greasy as petroleum jelly, and you can rub it in more completely as well.  </li>
      <li>Great moisturizer for my dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I like the lotion very much.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel smooth and soft all day.</li>
      <li>Superior quality and a standard for our home after being introduced to it in a medical facility.</li>
      <li>--it really makes a difference.</li>
      <li>It is sold at a reasonable price as well.</li>
      <li>the 24 notion suggesting you need to apply it once a day, isn&#x27;t realistic if you do things that require hand</li>
      <li>It locks in moisture for more than 24 hours, is rapidly absorbed into your skin and does not leave a greasy feeling behind.</li>
      <li>We learned of this product during my daughter&#x27;s overnight stay in the Children&#x27;s hospital which she was given this cream for her dry skin, she also has mild eczema.</li>
      <li>We were given a small tube in the hospital and were glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Fantastic skin cream to keep hands, elbows and other body parts soft.</li>
      <li>I am so happy to have found it my hands quit being so irritated with washing them or just being exposed to the cold.</li>
      <li>I have bought every sensitive skin, fragrance-free product on the market (eucerin, cetaphil, aquafor, etc).</li>
      <li>Since using it, I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference in texture of my skin.</li>
      <li>After a modest amount of time, the greasiness goes away.  </li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this cream in the hospital after I had surgery because I was so dry.  </li>
      <li>works really well with my dry skin</li>
      <li>The shipper delivered the product faster than expected and the product works very well.</li>
      <li>It is a little greasy initially but soaks in quickly.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for others with dry skin conditions.</li>
      <li>My hands get very chapped and dry during winter and this is the only hand cream I have found that works well for my situation.</li>

    <li> Loving this is no surprise - I&#x27;ve used it for years.  I was first introduced to it during a hospital stay and was so impressed with it that I had to get some for myself.  I&#x27;ve never found anything I like as well.</li>
    <li> I am sending an update and re-rating this store.  After talking with customer service, they assured me that what I received was only a partial order and that the remainder of my order is forthcoming.  That was not stated until I called customer service..  there was no indication on the packing slip...  So I am completely satisfied now.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for psoriasis for 2 decades. Love it. My doctor was stunned by how it controls my skin problems and now recommends it to his other patients. Look for the 3 pack for a real great price.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion very much. what I did not like is that it is advertised as a 3 pack. I received only 2 tubes. it would have been cheaper to buy it somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Sween 24 is great for moisturizing very dry skin</li>
    <li> The shipper delivered the product faster than expected and the product works very well. I commend the shipper for fast overnight shipping because I needed the product so bad. I had sores all over my back that itched and began to bleed. The Sween Cream did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Great for medical professionals that always wash their hands. However, I was sent a huge tube instead of 3 five oz tubes and promoted. I had to send them back, because exchange was not an option.</li>
    <li> I first used this cream while hospitalized for hip replacement surgery &amp; loved it! Immediately after going home from the hospital &amp; I ordered it from Amazon.  It&#x27;s wonderful for dry feet....just apply at bedtime.</li>
    <li> The protection lasts and lasts without the cream feeling heavy or greasy. We were given a small tube in the hospital and were glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not greasy and moisturizes skin.  It is easy to use and it applies and absorbs into the skin.  It works and I love it!</li>
    <li> This year I had multiple problems with dry skin issues. This product works wonderfully to provide long lasting moisture for my skin. I highly recommend it for others with dry skin conditions.</li>
    <li> Fantastic skin cream to keep hands, elbows and other body parts soft. Superior quality and a standard for our home after being introduced to it in a medical facility. Stops scaling and helps rough skin to be soft again. Everyone in the house enjoys this product.</li>
    <li> My kids and I have really dry skin (eczema) this cream works!!! I usually use Aveeno sensitive skin, but my youngest daughter breaks out with red rashes when I used that on her, so I tried this. It worked great on all of us and it really lasts. My legs felt moisturized all day! My legs looked horrible and now they are healed up. I loved this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my aunt as recommended by her wound care nurse.  My aunt loves the product and this was a second order.</li>
    <li> We first experienced this cream in the hospital...it is fabulous! Truly once a day moisterizer , especially for arms and hands.</li>
    <li> This cream is outstanding!  It&#x27;s done wonders for my scaly legs but the thing is when we have told others we go to, the nurses, doctors and my wound center say they&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> My little one has very dry, sometimes cracked skin due to her skin sensitivity.  I have bought every sensitive skin, fragrance-free product on the market (eucerin, cetaphil, aquafor, etc). None have worked as well as this product!  The nurse at the pediatrician&#x27;s office gave us a tube of this cream and literally within two days her dry cracked skin was gone.  I am so happy to have found this product!</li>
    <li> I love the way this lotion makes your skin feel after application.  I have recommended it to several friends who have then purchased.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best that I have found for my dry skin.  It does take just a bit to absorb, but it is great.  I will buy again</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this cream in the hospital after I had surgery because I was so dry.  I like it a lot and found it on amazon.  I use it regulary now.</li>
    <li> I have a serious injury to my hip...The hospitals and nursing homes used this cream on me, and I still use it!!</li>
    <li> Love this cream. I buy all the time. Good for the whole family</li>
    <li> Discovering this wonderful body cream in the hospital was the only thing good about having an emergency hip replacement. It&#x27;s a dream cream!</li>
    <li> My husband was given this product while in the hospital and I&#x27;m always looking for something to help my extremely dry skin.  This product does the trick without being greasy.  It seems to attract and hold moisture.  Since using it, I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference in texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing hand cream that I have every used and I have tried lots!  You only need to use it once a day but it feel so wonderful on your hands you want to use it more. A small amount does the job.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Wish I had discovered it earlier. I have really dry skin and nothing seems to get rid of the \\&quot;alligator skin.\\&quot; This product comes the closest. It is a little greasy initially but soaks in quickly.  Discovered it at friend&#x27;s who had received it at the hospital while a patient.  I knew where to look and Amazon didn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
    <li> Eve  though I love this cream, I paid for three 5oz tubes and only received one, I&#x27;m sure one 5oz tube does not cost $23.00</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  This is  my second order of this excellent product!</li>
    <li> I am a surgeon so I am constantly washing my hands. I hate the appearance and the feeling of dry skin so I keep one of the 2oz tubes in my pocket at all times and I use the larger tube at home every day. It locks in moisture for more than 24 hours, is rapidly absorbed into your skin and does not leave a greasy feeling behind. It makes my skin feel smooth and soft all day. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> My skin is like tissue thin and this cream has helped me so much, I use it before bed as I&#x27;m not washing my hands and it works for me.. also use during the day.  This cream was used on my Dear Mom and I kept the bottle hoping I could find it and finally did on Amazon, the look is different but it works the same as the other that she used. Great lotion also for itching and it protects your skin.</li>
    <li> It is the BEST lotion for severely dry, cracked and bleeding hands and feet!  I recommend this product to everyone who suffers from dry cracked skin.  It works for 24 HOURS!</li>
    <li> My mom was in a rehabilitation hospital after breaking her leg &amp; when we were taking her home Sween 24 was in her belongings, given to her by the staff. My mother gave it to me and I was so impressed that I not only used the one she gave me, I purchased 3 more from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon. It works better than any &amp; all moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I learned about Sween 24 Superior Moisturizing Skin Protectant Cream -- Coloplast--from an LPN at the assisted living care facility where my 93 year old aunt resides.  Her skin and her feet suffer from the dry air in Arizona, and the facility provides Sween 24 to sooth the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I tried it ourselves, and we love it.  We checked out the active ingredient, dimethecone 6%, which is silicon oil.  It isn&#x27;t as greasy as petroleum jelly, and you can rub it in more completely as well.  After a modest amount of time, the greasiness goes away.  And the soothing effect lasts quite a long time.  It&#x27;s not water resistant, so when you wash dishes it&#x27;s gone--the 24 notion suggesting you need to apply it once a day, isn&#x27;t realistic if you do things that require hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 tubes to keep at my Colorado home--it really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Sween protectant is one of the best moisturizing cream I have tried. I describe its texture as more of silky gel feel.  Glides on silky and fast, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it has helped my exema more than any other non perscription cream available. I get perscription ointment from my doctor for my exema but can only use it at night bvecause it is so greasy, and the Sween Cream is the closest I have found without being so greasy that I cannot function. I can use the Sween at work and it will completely be absorbed ito my skin.</li>
    <li> This is really nice. I have dry skin in the winter and everytime I was my hands they were getting red and irritated. My daughter had left a tube at our house and I tried it. Sween 24 Superior Moisturizing Skin Protectan Cream is really good. I trust the company that makes it (I was a nurse for many years and this company makes many products for skin that work great) so looked for it on Amazon. I am so happy to have found it my hands quit being so irritated with washing them or just being exposed to the cold.</li>
    <li> I use this cream every day. It makes my skin feel great. I was so happy when i became aware of it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for my dry, sensitive skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This cream has been wonderful during these New England winter months for both myself and my infant twins skin.  We learned of this product during my daughter&#x27;s overnight stay in the Children&#x27;s hospital which she was given this cream for her dry skin, she also has mild eczema. The cream is not too greasy and a little goes a long way. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> love this! works really well with my dry skin</li>
    <li> The best hand cream I ever had. My husband had it in the hospial and I love it so I searched Amazon and there it was! You&#x27;ll want more.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever!</li>
    <li> Sween 24 has helped the skin on my legs and face,and feet, my sister uses it too and has very good results.</li>
    <li> This lotion lasts all day long.  I use it every day to keep my skin flexible because my leg swells.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My hands get very chapped and dry during winter and this is the only hand cream I have found that works well for my situation. It is sold at a reasonable price as well.</li>
