      <li>Absolutely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I have used Gillette razors for years, particularly Divine &amp; Venus, and found them to be excellent, but this is unworthy of Gillette&#x27;s brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but they are very nice and give me a clean shave with tons of protection from cuts.</li>
      <li>It is really nice to be able to shave your legs while in the shower and not have to apply any kind of shaving cream.</li>

      <li>The very first shave is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>It was very smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>On top of that, I really don&#x27;t think it ever gave me a great shave.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome price &amp; quick delivery</li>
    <li> its OK. at least i don&#x27;t have to go to the store</li>
    <li> I have used Venus Razors for years and have preferred the Breeze/Spa Breeze blades.  My least favorite is the Embrace because the strip isn&#x27;t very thick and doesn&#x27;t provide me much protection from the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated buying the Olay because of the price.  While none of the Venus blades is cheap, the Olay is the most expensive.  I needed to bump my Amazon cart to $25 to get add-on products, so I figured I&#x27;d give the Olay a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely my favorite now.  I can&#x27;t say I will use them full time (cost again) but they are very nice and give me a clean shave with tons of protection from cuts.</li>
    <li> I do not like to shave with soap  or shaving cream.  When my legs are all wet, I run this great 5 bladed razor right across my skin and  it leaves me soft, silky, and smooth every time.  One stroke and all my hairs are gone.  I always finish with lotion and I am never itchy.  I will always use Venus &amp; Olay razors!</li>
    <li> For the first three shaves it was pretty amazing but after the third, it was really hard to lather and maneuver. In all honesty, I&#x27;d stick to the regular razors and just buy a good shave gel. It&#x27;ll have better results than this combination. The idea is brilliant but the execution of this product was not well thought out.</li>
    <li> I use these because I have a stand alone shower and no place to rest my leg when shaving to apply a shave gel, etc. This makes it a lot easier and I don&#x27;t have to rely soley on the soap/gel for moisture and lotion. They do run out fairly quickly, but usually by then the blades are close to needing a replacement as well.</li>
    <li> At a little over $5 a cartridge, it&#x27;s really NOT worth it. Does it give a smooth shave...of course it&#x27;s a Venus razor, is this the most expensive cartridge...YES. Is it the best....NO. The Olay strips do not last more than 3 shaves. It was never exposed to direct water so I was really disappointed in them. The very first shave is AMAZING! It&#x27;s so smooth &amp; glides over you skin without even feeling like its touching, by the 3rd shave, it&#x27;s the WORST Venus cartridge I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sticking with Venus, but not buying into the hype from the Olay strips!</li>
    <li> I received this product to try from BzzAgent. This razor leaves your skin feeling smooth for longer than most razors ant your hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast. I was a little bit disappointed when the razor holder wouldn&#x27;t stick to the inside of my shower, but all in all this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Yes, it costs a bit more, but if you figure out how much you spend on shaving gel/cream and blades for what you use now, and add in the time you save by not having to use gel/cream, plus knowing you will probably never get another nick, it&#x27;s ready to use with just a swipe under water (and another to rinse) and I figure this is a bargain.  Especially in the summertime!</li>
    <li> the best of this line</li>
    <li> I am the first to admit that I always seem to be in a hurry when I shave and nick my knees and ankles on a weekly basis.  You would think I would get the hang of shaving after so many years.  I got this as a sample in a monthly beauty box that I had subscribed to and fell in love with it the first shaving.  I have used it about 10 times and it still is like new.  I don&#x27;t know why one person said it was only good for one shave, as that is rubbish.  I used the little suction cup to hang it in my shower and keep it dry unless shaving and it is holding up quite well.  I expect to get some more use out of it.  Today I had a couple coupons from the local paper and found some deals this weekend &amp; I stocked up.  I now have refills for the Sugarberry scent and a few more new razor packs with the handles stocked in my cupboard. I don&#x27;t expect to change razors for a very very long time.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Big floppy shaving blade. Bizarre.  Results in an uneven shave. These are terrible and the rubber like Olay &#x27;bumpers&#x27; disintegrate.  I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> Great shaver and very soothing.</li>
    <li> The heads look like they do on the box.  However, the top and bottom are on flaps that are a little strange to work with.  It is probably to help it get closer to your skin as the creams go down but it&#x27;s a little awkward to use.  I&#x27;m used to being able to put my finger on the back of the razor but if I do that with this, you get some of the flaps under your fingernails or release the head.  I like it but I probably won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> Yes these are expensive, but you won&#x27;t need shaving cream ever again. I like how silky smooth my legs are after using this. The only thing I dislike is the slimy feeling the Olay bars have after being wet for a while and the bars melt very fast. After 5-6 uses I need to replace the razor cartridge, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite razor blades ever! I recommend all the time! Feels so nice on my legs and doesn&#x27;t require shaving cream/gel.</li>
    <li> I love all Venus razors. I usually use Spa or Breeze but Olay is awesome for the moisture! Plus is has 5 blades so you get all those hairs in one swipe! If you want a nice clean shave this product is worth it.</li>
    <li> Today it tried the new Venus and Olay razor by Gillette. The shave was amazing leaving my skin soft and smooth. Thank you Gillete Venus for the free product I will definitely recommend and buy this product for now on.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from some program run by Venus. Anyways it&#x27;s a great razor it had my legs feeling soft and silky, but the only thing I did not like is that the soap bars melted away the first time I used it, but overall its good razor and it smells good...</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I gave up on women&#x27;s razors long ago. The ones I had bought in the past always had all sorts of \\&quot;nick and cut prevention measures\\&quot; implemented, and I found that while I didn&#x27;t get any nicks, cuts, or razor burn, I never got a close shave. I&#x27;m not  huge on the girly girl side of things, so when I do end up doing beauty maintenance, I want it to be as efficient as possible. So, I started stealing my husbands razors, and they worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially rec&#x27;d this Olay razor as part of a product testing box. I was skeptical, and even remember saying to my husband \\&quot;Psh. A women&#x27;s razor. Like this will be any good.\\&quot; But, dutifully I went to give it a try. I was actually surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a bit to get used to the moisturizing strips and maneuvering, but I had it down within the first couple of shaves. I can now shave my legs in the shower in under 5 minutes, and it works great on my armpits, too. The blade swivels and contours nicely, the moisturizers smell pretty good, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues yet with cuts and nicks, though I do get the occasional spot of razorburn around my knees. Not sure why, but it&#x27;s not all that horrible. I made my husband try it when shaving his face, and he said it wasn&#x27;t that bad either as far as closeness to the skin and a smooth shave, but he didn&#x27;t like that he \\&quot;smelled like a girl\\&quot; when he was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my husband is glad to have his razors back, and I am glad to have my subscribe and save order - it&#x27;s cheaper than even WalMart.</li>
    <li> It is really nice to be able to shave your legs while in the shower and not have to apply any kind of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I loved using these but they don&#x27;t last very long you&#x27;ll have to replace them every couple weeks which can get expensive.</li>
    <li> Cut myself repeatedly</li>
    <li> Same as always, I love these things. They get a close shave and the gel stuff works very well to keep my skin from becoming irritated. I do not recommend using no shave gel/cream but the strips around the razors keep it gliding so smoothly!</li>
    <li> The razors are great and beat out most people&#x27;s prices. However, I found a 5 count for the sane price. That&#x27;s why they get 3 stars.</li>
    <li> These are my two favorite body product brands and I&#x27;m happy they joined forces. The big moisturizing bands can be kind of uncomfortable to get used to at first, but it really helps with making it a smooth shave.  The razor just glides over your legs, only using hot water.  The risk of cutting yourself is minimal. However, I feel that since the moisturizing bands are so exposed, these are gonna dissolve away way faster than other cartridges.. but we&#x27;ll see how it goes!</li>
    <li> Love these. Been using them since 2012. Well worth the money. Leave your skin smooth, soft and beats the hassle of having to use shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Gillette for an honest review. I have to admit that when it was time to buy a refill for this razor, I was a little surprised by the price. To me, it seemed a little bit high, BUT I loved the razor and really didn&#x27;t want to give it up. I purchased a 3 count set of refills and have not regretted it. The shave that this razor gives is fabulous. It&#x27;s a close, smooth shave. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love these blades and the smell of the cocoa butter, but they are just too damned expensive.</li>
    <li> The soap/conditioning part of the razor is gone in about a week. The actual shave you achieve is average at best.</li>
    <li> Love these- easy to use and they leave your skin soft</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but I stopped buying since it got pricey.</li>
    <li> I got this Razor free via a promotion from Crest. I really liked the Venus an Olay razor. The only problem is,is that the moisturizer bar does not last as long as it says it does. I would sag about a shower or two... So I recommend not leaving the razor in the shower when not using. Other than that it was great and it did not leave any red razor bumps or anything. Plus the scent of the moisturizing bar  is pretty refreshing also!</li>
    <li> I love these. I have really sensitive skin. I get horrible razor burn with most razors.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything to prevent it, shaving creams, oils, different razors and lotions. This is the only razor that I have found that gives an awesome close shave without causing razor burn or skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;It is more expensive, especially since it is disposable, but it really works great.</li>
    <li> OK, I do like the solid shave lotion that&#x27;s attached but my god are the cartridges expensive. The razor in just like all the other Venus razors. Keep it out of the water because the shaving bar will dissolve super fast. Not good if you take baths because the razor gets too wet and you&#x27;ll end up using it all up in a few shaves. If you like the formula for the shave bar Van Der Hagen Shave Soap is just like it, super cheap, easy to find, and will last forever compared to how fast you&#x27;ll use up this stuff (retails for $2.50 at my local drugstore).</li>
    <li> have to change too often.  Loses its ability for a close shave way too soon.  Otherwise I really like the product.  How about a razor that lasts longer than 3 shaves?  I always take it out of the shower, shake the access H2o off, then place in it&#x27;s holder.  It&#x27;s also very pricey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very prone to shaving bumps and irritation. This product has proven to be quite effective at preventing them! I am left very silky smooth afterwards. The only reason I&#x27;m knocking off a star is because these have a weird smell to them. It&#x27;s not overpowering, but it is odd.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful and smelling so good , leaves the skin so moisturizing and perfect shaved. We have more space of time between each shave. I love it !</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever had!  It is ready to use and there&#x27;s no need to add anything.  Will not nick your legs!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like these.  I find the blade to be an overly large awkward shape and I don&#x27;t think the Olay strip does much.  It melts away easily and if you want to preserve the strip you would need to take it out of the shower every time you aren&#x27;t using it.  If I keep mine in the hanging shower caddy water from the shower gets all over it and the strip just washes away.  I prefer to use shaving gel with a regular Venus razor.</li>
    <li> By far the best Venus blades out there!  The Olay strip really does prevent shaving burns and/or bumps.  My skin is sensitive and thought it was just the price to pay to be groomed. . . I  bought this because it was on sale and have not used anything else since!  You definitely notice a difference when the strip runs down as the shave is just not as smooth and pleasant.  Luckily this is on Subscribe and Save so it is an excellent buy and I am always in stock!</li>
    <li> Once I used this razor I was hooked.  The absolute best shave.  I can&#x27;t find them anywhere except Amazon.  Thank goodness.</li>
    <li> The new Gillette and olay Venus Razor is and now will be my new razor. It makes my skin smooth and soft. And already to go without sheve cream if you are short on time. Im totally in love. Thank you Gillette for giving me the oppertunity to allow me to try this new razor #lovebeingabuzzagenet #gotitfre</li>
    <li> The only ones I use. I am lazy and hate shaving with a passion. I can&#x27;t deal with cuts or dry legs from other razors. This is a great razor. I popped it onto my old venus base, and it fits fine. I store it so that the soap strip does not touch any surfaces and it lasts longer. Will re-purchase!</li>
    <li> These are pretty awful. They only last for one or two uses, even if you keep the blades dry between uses. The moisture strips become floppy, making it frustrating to use. Disappointing, as I love Olay and Venus.</li>
    <li> These work really great!  I&#x27;ve always used Venus razors in the past, but now that I&#x27;ve tried these I won&#x27;t ever use anything else.  They are a little more expensive than the others, but worth it.  I still use shaving cream, but I don&#x27;t think you really have to.  But with both my legs are super smooth.  One piece of advice:  if you put it in a travel bag, put in in a plastic baggie first.  I just threw it in while it was still wet, and the Olay parts stuck to the sides and pulled off.</li>
    <li> The bars don&#x27;t seem to want to stay on the razor and get all slimy after one or two uses, I was able to try this product via a campaign by Venus and I&#x27;m glad I did, it does offer a great close shave and soft smooth skin after!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it has 5 blades (major plus for women&#x27;s razors) and I love Olay brand lotion. Basically it&#x27;s a regular razor despite all the hype, but I don&#x27;t feel ripped off because I paid about the same as I would for any other replaceable heads; and I really like that the Venus razors, you can mix and match handles to heads. I gave it four stars because I&#x27;ve yet to find a razor blade, men or women&#x27;s, that has given me a perfectly close underarm shave. Sorry if TMI. :)</li>
    <li> I love these they leave my legs sooooooo smooth and soft! I love Olay and Venus products for them to combine together for this amazing razor is just wonderful!! Everyone should get these!! Thank you Gillette and Olay for the best razor ever!!!</li>
    <li> I usually use the spa one but I thought I would give this one a try. The bars are bigger than the spa one which can make a close shave an issue but my legs don&#x27;t feel as rough/dry as when I use the spa one. I&#x27;m still on the fence and have bought this several times because on one hand no dry legs but it is hard to get a good shave.</li>
    <li> I have purchsed this item three times now from Amazon for my Venus razor. The refill cartridges have been a consistent quality (read this is not a cheap Chinese knock-off). I really don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about these other than I wish they were a bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> I like these shavers doesn&#x27;t dry me out to much while getting the job done. Gave me smooth lines while still not slicing me to ribbons.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, but the only problem is that the Olay soap part just went away too fast.  I shaved my whole legs and the bar is almost gone. It would be really great for just quick when you need to shave a small area. It is great for that, but I think that needing like to shave your whole body is not the best thing to use it for.</li>
    <li> These were wonderful. I&#x27;ve always had problems with ingrown hairs on my legs, but these heads worked wonders. My only complaint is the moisture bars only last a couple days. They&#x27;re gone before the razors are dull.</li>
    <li> Influenster gave me one of these to me complementary for review. They gave me two types, but because you can use any Venus refills on any refillable shaver body the company makes. Really nice if you get bored of looking at the same shaver color! Out of the two refills, this one was my favorite. First time I didn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream, AT ALL. Its so easy to use, that I threw out all my shaving creams. This works better also than shaving cream, due to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t give me razor burns or bumps, which I use to get ALL the time with conventional razors that you need to use with cream. This razor makes me want to shave... before this razor head I use to dread shaving my legs because it took so much time. This product is great!</li>
    <li> I like that it is smooth and  moisturizing but it does cost a lot...despite the coupon. I would buy it again though for its quality</li>
    <li> I received these as a promotion for Venus &amp; Olay, and was nervous at first about whether or not I&#x27;d like them. I love the close shave provided by the Venus &amp; Olay Razors. The hydration works wonders for my legs, and leaves them feeling soft and smooth! I more than likely will continue to use this kind and recommend to friends &amp; family!</li>
    <li> Unless and until I can get a closer shave for less money this is what I will purchase. I&#x27;d be great if you can find on sale/discount or bulk! Excellent shave, way better than any disposable brand.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like to buy things from gillette, because i know they test on animals, but these are the most unique razors i&#x27;ve ever seen, with solid shaving cream attached to the razor head.  super close shave.  too bad they test on animals.</li>
    <li> Performs as expected. No issues</li>
    <li> I have literally never had a shaving experience like this before. I look forward to shaving my legs. Can you believe it? Love love love these, best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a very long time.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite razor. The only way it could be better is by lowering the cost. It is the best razor on the market !</li>
    <li> I got this only because of the Olay in it. I do like it but it seems like it doesn&#x27;t last as long as a regular Venus razor blades because of the product on the razor blades gets washed away. So you loose a lot of money when it comes down to the cost between these razors &amp; the other Venus razors. The shaving cream you can buy is a lot cheaper &amp; last you a lot longer!! The razor alone was $11.00, &amp; that didn&#x27;t include any razor cartridges. I hate to waste the money purchasing it, but I will probably go back to my original Venus when I run out of the cartridges. Way over priced!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Venus razors for years now and the Olay one is one of the best! Smells good and feels good! I will continue to purchase these cartridges for as long as they keep selling them!! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this really excited about it! I really thought that I was going to fall in love with this but I was dead wrong! The first use the Moisture Bar release skin conditioner fell off on all of them! On top of that, I really don&#x27;t think it ever gave me a great shave. I tried to contact the manufacturer, however they never responded back to me. I will not ever be buying this again!  ( P.S. I am usually a fan of Venus products so this was pretty disappointing )</li>
    <li> I tested this out via a free sample I received from Influenster.com. I used this razor cartridge with the regular venus embrace handle (I just recently discovered that they are interchangeable!) Love love love this razor. It created a close shave and was silky smooth on my legs. I hardly felt like I was shaving it was so smooth. I will most certainly be using this razor from now on!</li>
    <li> I received this product from influenster and I fell in love with it. It was very smooth and silky. It was so smooth I couldn&#x27;t even tell I was shaving anything. I will be recommending this product to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I recently received a complimentary Venus razor with an Olay cartridge from Influenster to reveiw.  I&#x27;ve used the Embrace cartridges before, but this was my first time trying the Olay blades. The first time I used it my legs were so silky smooth!  Unfortunately after subsequent uses I&#x27;ve realized that these cartridges aren&#x27;t going to last long at all.  The blades are still sharp, but the moisture strips are almost gone after about four uses.  I will probably continue to use the razor with regular shaving cream, but if you&#x27;re buying this product just to avoid having to also purchase shaving cream, you&#x27;re going to have to replace the blades OFTEN.&lt;br /&gt;One new thing I learned was that you can use any of the Venus cartridges with any Venus handle.  Awesome news, because I have a few random refills sitting around and was putting off buying an Embrace razor to use them with.  Now I don&#x27;t have to!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used venus spa breeze for a couple years now and I decided to switch it up and use something new. although i dont like the smell, it leave my legs super soft and gives me a really close shave.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this product has been life changing for me! Thanks to these cartridges, razor burn after shaving is gone! This product is convenient because the cartridges are interchangeable with other Venus handles. The downfall is that they&#x27;re slightly expensive (compared to other Venus refill cartridges) and they need to be replaced frequently. This seems to be the best option for my sensitive skin, so the price is worth it to me. I&#x27;ve purchased these refills many times and will continue to do so!</li>
    <li> How did we ever get along with smooth legs before the inventon of these stellar razor blades?!  We didn&#x27;t!  There are absolutely wonderful blades.</li>
    <li> The Venus is the best razor, no cuts or chafing just smooth, smooth legs.  I will continue to buy these razors</li>
    <li> Venus is the best shaver there is!  I have found that for me--once the Olay has has run it&#x27;s course--just a few days for me (I am one leg-shaving fool--a little OCD :0) the razor doesn&#x27;t work as well----but I am sure that is only me and my quirks :0</li>
    <li> I love this Venus &amp; Olay collaboration. It leaves my legs nice and soft, so, buying this refill is worth it!</li>
    <li> Great smooth shave. Leaves your skin soft and no irritation. I&#x27;ve always used Oil of Olay for cleaning my make up off and keeping my face soft and young looking. I love the combination of both.</li>
    <li> I swear by these razor blades. They may be expensive, but they are totally worth it and last longer than regular razors. Also when the conditioners run out it is more of an incentive to put a new razor head on instead of use the same razor for way longer than you should.</li>
    <li> If you can get past the sticker shock these provide an amazing shave, and no need for a shave gel. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The razor and cartridge combo is the best for shaving your legs quickly and without razor burn or cuts! It was always such a pain to pull out the shaving cream and lather up and with these you don&#x27;t need to do any of that! Saves a lot of time in the shower!</li>
    <li> Works great, i love that i don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream. and it smells great :) i will buy again</li>
    <li> Always looked for a razor that would do a close shave! but this is everything i had ever hoped for!!! close shave, leaves skin smooth and hair grows back slower!! Girls: TOSS ANY OTHER RAZOR YOU MAY HAVE BECAUSE THIS ONE IS A KEEPER!</li>
    <li> I hate when it turns cold out and shaving.  My skin was always left dry but with these it adds a bit of extra moisture! Great product!  Also all handles fit any refill so no need to buy new ones each season!  I received these in my Influenster box and loved them but I was a Venus user before hand anyways.</li>
    <li> With venus these blades now fit any handle. I got the Olay blade from Infuenster and it was the smoothest shave. No razor burn or scaly skin the next day.</li>
    <li> FIRST OFF, I need to say, I use these refills with my Venus Embrace handle! ANY Venus blade refill fits any Venus razor handle! Isn&#x27;t that awesome? Secondly, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this refill. I don&#x27;t even need shaving cream anymore. The Olay blade leaves my skin feeling so smooth and amazing. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but SO WORTH EVERY PENNY!&lt;br /&gt;*this product was sent to me complimentary from Influenster. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have really dry legs so with normal razors and razor heads I get all kinds of nicks. I got an Olay Venus head with my influenster cosmo vox box and I was amazed at how smooth my legs felt afterward and I didn&#x27;t get cut at all! I am definitely switching to these full time. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> less expensive than buying at my grocery store.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving cream.  Perfect for air travel!</li>
    <li> Ok, I finally splurged and bought this, it was $8.99 at a grocery store that starts with a K and I had a $3.00 ecoupon. It was very smooth while shaving, just a little pressure, no nicks no cuts. My normal go to is the Intuition razor with soap bars which is good to travel with, but they make my legs way to dry and I get those red bumps and bars do not last long. Otherwise I have to regular disposable razors I rotate between I have been using one for about 12 months..yes 12 months and the other one abt 6 months (Mach 3 refill), I never leave them in the shower and my ac/heat vents are in the floor so I dry them over the vents...miracle and money saver too. So this is my splurge I am drying it over the vent also will let you know how long it lasts...</li>
    <li> would not buy them again used it twice and the strips are melted , not worth it.</li>
    <li> These are a must for dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got to say!  Really that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m going to say, and this review is making me write more.</li>
    <li> I expected this to be awesome, but they&#x27;re bulky heads that disintegrate quickly. The moisture wasn&#x27;t any better than the Embrace Venus Cartridges. I&#x27;ve never gone through razor heads as fast as I blew through these 3. For the same price, I now buy the Embrace ones that come 5 in a package for the same price and they last twice as long.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. At first I thought that the large size would be cumbersome, but the razor glides more smoothly and gently than any razor I&#x27;ve tried. My skin is very sensitive, and I generally always get razor burn and small cuts on my shins. I have to generally shave \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; of my leg hair on my shins, to avoid the abrasion I usually get with other handheld razors. Not so with this razor. The emollient parts of the razor last a long time, and my husband has even been using it to shave his face! He says it&#x27;s fantastic as well, and we will continue to purchase the head replacements for this razor. A wonderful product, and definitely not the type of review I&#x27;ve ever thought I&#x27;d give a RAZOR of all things. This razor actually inspires me to shave my legs, and I&#x27;ve been known to go all winter without a shave! ;) Please note that I received a free trial offer of this razor from SheSpeaks in exchange for my honest opinion on the product. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinion here is my own.</li>
    <li> Overall, I love Gillette razors- they are all I&#x27;ve used for over 10 years.  (I have tried a few others, but never seem to like them as much) These razor blades are great for shaving without shaving cream- but they wear down like 5X faster than other razor blades without the Olay stuff on them.  Also, they work great for the first couple shaves and they don&#x27;t seem to get as close after the bars wear down a bit.  I can&#x27;t leave them in the shower because they also wear down when they get wet; So when my husband showers, they wear down just from getting wet.  I think I&#x27;ll save them for traveling so I don&#x27;t have to drag shaving cream with me and use the cheaper ones that work just as well with shaving cream at home.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy how my legs are left feeling nice and smooth but I wish the Olay Moisture Bars would last longer. I feel like I need to replace the razor blade way before the blade is dull as the Moisture bars run out way too quickly. I love how I can get a really close shave with the 5 blades and can not go back to any other razor after having this as a standard feature. I was able to try these blades out with the help of Influenster.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these cartridges! I was sent it by Influenster and am so excited I got it! The glide smoothly with no snagging and no nicks. It&#x27;s a close shave that leaves my hairy monkey legs smooth for three days! My favorite part of the Venus lie is that all of the handles and cartridges are interchangeable so there&#x27;s no stress when shopping for new razors! Buy these-- you&#x27;ll love them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lasered my legs (tmi) but the few random fine ones that were missed during a session are diminished with a fine razor. I like using it in the shower. I was given a razor for review by influenster.</li>
    <li> I love how these blades are interchangeable with my other venus razor so I didn&#x27;t have to buy an entire razor. The Olay cartridge was great in that I didn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream with it. I have sensitive skin, but it left my legs feeling soft and moisturized. My only complaint is that the moisturizing bars didn&#x27;t last as long as the razor blades did.</li>
    <li> Love how the olay bars leave your skin silky smooth.  These are so easy to travel with, no mess, no hassle, and you can use them on any venus handle.  Genius.&lt;br /&gt;Received the product for testing from Influenster.</li>
    <li> My favorite razor.  It&#x27;s pricey but we&#x27;ll worth it.  Good quality, boxes not damaged.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor and blades for my daughter and she loves them.  I tried these blades and also loved them and decided to buy some for myself.  Highly recommend and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Works very well in shower.</li>
    <li> Bought this on vacation because out of razors &amp; shaving cream. Horrible! I have used Gillette razors for years, particularly Divine &amp; Venus, and found them to be excellent, but this is unworthy of Gillette&#x27;s brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the lotion does smell amazing, and yes your skin is soft. But a razor lasts like only one use! The blades were easily bunked up with hair, and when trying to rinse the hair out it&#x27;s taking away more of the moisturizers. I tried flicking the hair out, to no avail, and so in order to try to keep the moisturizing bars at least for this one shave, I had to shave with a razor half+ gunked with hair. It was extremely frustrating and in the end the moisture bars are almost used up in one use! That is unacceptable at this price point. And, what&#x27;s more, my legs are left less well-shaven than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, if you really love the smell, shave first with a disposable razor and then go over again with this.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that glides over the skin and leaves the skin so soft.  I love the Venus products!</li>
    <li> Did you know that you can mix-&amp;-match with any Venus blade refill fits any Venus razor handle. I tried this refill with Embrace and it worked great I am so happy and will always use Gillette</li>
    <li> Best razors EVER... I live in Denver where it is dry as HELL.  My skin really suffers!  These razors do the job and then some.  Skin is calm and silky plus I usually don&#x27;t have to put on lotion (during the summer).  Super smooth shaves every time.</li>
    <li> no soap or cream required, only hot water, i love these things and my legs no longer get nicked. :-)</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It provides a very close smooth shave. Plus I am a very big olay fan. I only use play body wash so I was very very excited to learn I could get a razor with olay.</li>
    <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve used, no nicks or cuts...very smooth.  Only reasons it gets four stars is it costs way too much for a three pack!</li>
    <li> I have never cut myself with one of these because of the way they&#x27;re made. Most razors will cause at least a little nick here or there. I like that you don&#x27;t need soap or shaving cream to use this, and it leaves my legs feeling great. My one complaint is that they seem to become dull very quickly, but nothing else gets my legs this smooth, so I&#x27;m sticking with them.</li>
    <li> I think that the fact that the handle is interchangeable with all of the different styles of razors is amazing. You do not have to buy the handle that fits a certain style so that means you can test out different razors to see which one you like the best and it does not cost a fortune. I got a free sample of the Venus handle and an Oil of Olay razor as well as the embrace from @Influenster. Although the Oil of Olay razor provided an AMAZING shave on day 1 and 2 by day 3 I was annoyed with the flaps that were now empty of \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; and just got the way of my shave. I am looking forward to trying our the other razors.</li>
    <li> Gillette has two varieties of the Venus &amp; Olay razors: this one and [[ASIN:B00AFCOWJS Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scent Cartridges 3 Count]]. They both perform the same with the only difference being the scent. The Gillette Venus and Olay razor doesn&#x27;t state it but it smells like warm vanilla, which I prefer over the Sugarberry scent. The Sugarberry scent is very faint and fades fast after initial use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gives a close, smooth shave on the legs but does not work as well on the underarms because of the bulk of the shaving bar surrounding the razor. The plus side of the shaving bar&#x27;s size is it keeps me from nicking myself in the underarm area. The shaving bar on the razor lathers up quickly initially but with each use it lathers less. The lather the first few uses is a little slimy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs are less than average hairy and I only shave from the knee down since I don&#x27;t have any hair on the thighs (Asian heredity) so I was able to use this razor to shave my underarms every day and my legs about three times a week for 2 1/2 weeks before I felt like I needed to change the razor. I didn&#x27;t need to use any soap (I don&#x27;t use shaving creams) for the first week but by the second week I did use soap while shaving because by this point the shaving bar is 2/3 less it&#x27;s original size and doesn&#x27;t lather very well however the razor blades are still giving a close, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Venus &amp; Olay razor does moisturize the legs and I never felt dry from shaving or razor burn which is a problem I have with most razors after shaving even the [[ASIN:B003EMPN7G Gillette Venus Original Razor, 1 Razor 2 Cartridges, 1-count Package]]. I&#x27;m switching the Venus &amp; Olay razor from the Original Venus even though the refill razors cost more. I think the cost difference is worth not having razor burn or dry, tight skin after shaving.</li>
    <li> Actually stopped getting the play version. It was a bit too... Slimey/lotiony? Glides right over the hair with out cutting. I dunno but I use another Venus  similar to it but not Olay  and it works great.</li>
    <li> I mean dont get me wrong I like it... but the bar around the razor runs out way before the razor is due to be replaced.... so then what? I wouldnt buy again they are so expensive but on that first shave that bar definitely left my legs silky smooth so im torn</li>
    <li> I love these! They make my legs feel really smooth. I have sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s hard to find something that works without making my skin irritated, and these didn&#x27;t. I also love that these fit on the regular venus handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received mine complimentary from Influenster)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know until recently that you could interchange the Venus heads on this razor. So, I pout the Venus &amp; Olay head onmy regular Venus Embrace head and it fit! It is now my favorite razor head! It leaves my legs soft and smooth, while moisturizing along the way. There is a bar on the top and bottom of the blade, so it leaves a trail before and after you shave. No need for soap! I have COARSE hair and lots of it and it takes care of it, leaving my legs, bikini area, underarms and anywhere I need to shave, soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom! My husband loves to caress my legs after I have shaved with this razor! And the razor lasts for months, even with regular shaving, so it is worth the price, since it lasts so long! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> venus seems to come out with a new razor every couple of months, and frankly i never bothered to keep up. i only went to target to buy a new razor when i realized i left mine at someones&#x27; house when traveling over the holidays. i picked the venus/olay one because it was on sale, simple as that. i figured if i didn&#x27;t like it, it would still take the &#x27;divine&#x27; cartridges i used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was shocked at how much i liked this one. it left my legs smoother than ever before; it was truly a closer shave. and on top of it, i didn&#x27;t need shaving cream (i always used olay body wash as shaving cream in the past anyway). this is definitely going to be more convenient for travel because it prevents one from having to a big bottle of shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;downsides- the olay cream part of the cartridge wears down pretty fast (probably get in a good 5 shaves) and, if you want to do a quick swipe of the razor over your skin (i do this for missed spots or underarms), it leaves a soapy residue, so you end up having to wash it off. i&#x27;ve learned to switch to a &#x27;divine&#x27; cartridge when i want to do a quick swipe of my underarms in the morning, and use this exclusively for when i&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
