      <li>:D</li>
      <li>and I periodically go on hunts for the best...</li>
      <li>The telescopic is the best because you don&#x27;t get clumps on your lashes.</li>
      <li>So I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Great buy</li>
      <li>and I honestly can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m as impressed as they are.</li>
      <li>Its not clumpy, it doesn&#x27;t run, and i can remove it with a cloth and warm water!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really good mascara.</li>
      <li>no clumps, no smudges and one coat is perfect for long, defined lashes...the one in the gold container is good for evening whereas this is perfect for daytime...</li>
      <li>I am really enjoying this mascara!</li>
      <li>It never clamps my lashes (it has quite unique wand) and gives very nice extension.</li>
      <li>Just like the description it gives my lashes nice clean definition and the look of lengthening!</li>
      <li>I have been using this brand for years and love that Amazon carries it now, and it&#x27;s cheaper than buying it at the stores.</li>
      <li>I did want them more noticeable, longer and &amp;#34;combed&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I am very happy to say that I have finally found my eyelashes&#x27; soulmate/mascara..</li>
      <li>no need to spend more than $10 on your mascara IMO....</li>
      <li>I love this mascara and the price</li>
      <li>I love the plastic brush, it helps &#x27;comb&#x27; the lashes.    </li>
      <li>it just goes on smooth, and my daughter doesn&#x27;t tell me I need more mascara anymore.</li>
      <li>:) This mascara is true to its promise.</li>
      <li>I honestly had higher hopes.</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of L&#x27;Oreal products and this mascara is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>It is absolutely my all time favorite.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not what I hoped it would be.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
      <li>Finally, a mascara that doesn&#x27;t require relentless layering just to be able to see it.  </li>
      <li>My favorite mascara and the only mascara I&#x27;ll ever use..</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara.  </li>
      <li>It goes on very evenly, not clumpy.</li>
      <li>I feel like I have to buy it more often than other brands that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>but this is hands down my favorite...</li>
      <li>I was told to buy this from friends who spoke highly of it</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new mascara.</li>
      <li>Also, although I have no personal complaints about it, I will say that if you&#x27;re someone who wants a lot of volume/thickness, this isn&#x27;t your mascara.</li>
      <li>I had my make-up professionally done and the artist used this brand and recommended it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve stayed loyal to Clean Definition Telescopic mascara for at least the last 3 years now.</li>
      <li>I thought I loved Carbon Black, but it was feeling a bit gloppy lately.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned Dior, Chanel, Mac, Bare Escentuals</li>

<li> Big disappointment in L&#x27;Oreal for even attaching their name to such a loser product.</li>
<li> I like this wand for applying my mascara because it isn&#x27;t as messy.</li>
<li> and what&#x27;s there is dry and useless.  </li>
<li> There is hardly any product in the tube ...</li>
<li> I am so sad that Loreal has quit making this mascara.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loreal has discontinued this mascara and I like it for its ease of using and non clumping.  I wish they would bring it back on the market!</li>
    <li> I adore this mascara and I periodically go on hunts for the best...I&#x27;ve owned Dior, Chanel, Mac, Bare Escentuals but this is hands down my favorite...no clumps, no smudges and one coat is perfect for long, defined lashes...the one in the gold container is good for evening whereas this is perfect for daytime...no need to spend more than $10 on your mascara IMO....the rest of your makeup - yes but this does the trick</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t order this if you like good-quality mascara.  There is hardly any product in the tube ... and what&#x27;s there is dry and useless.  Big disappointment in L&#x27;Oreal for even attaching their name to such a loser product.</li>
    <li> I guess this mascara has been discontinued since I cannot find it in any drug store. So I was happy to find it on Amazon. It never clamps my lashes (it has quite unique wand) and gives very nice extension.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and the price just did it for me these go for 9$ at the store. Great buy</li>
    <li> I honestly had higher hopes. I was told to buy this from friends who spoke highly of it and I honestly can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m as impressed as they are. It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not what I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this mascara! Just like the description it gives my lashes nice clean definition and the look of lengthening!</li>
    <li> I am very happy to say that I have finally found my eyelashes&#x27; soulmate/mascara.. :) This mascara is true to its promise. It gives you no clumps, it lengthens and darkens your eyelashes thereby making it thicker in appearance without making it too obvious that you&#x27;re actually wearing a mascara! THIS. IS. A. KEEPER. :D</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of L&#x27;Oreal products and this mascara is AMAZING! I have been using this brand for years and love that Amazon carries it now, and it&#x27;s cheaper than buying it at the stores. The telescopic is the best because you don&#x27;t get clumps on your lashes. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Finally, a mascara that doesn&#x27;t require relentless layering just to be able to see it.  But it doesn&#x27;t clump - it just goes on smooth, and my daughter doesn&#x27;t tell me I need more mascara anymore.</li>
    <li> I am so sad that Loreal has quit making this mascara.  It is absolutely my all time favorite.  It lengthens without clumping.  AND, it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve stayed loyal to Clean Definition Telescopic mascara for at least the last 3 years now. I&#x27;ve tried several others, but I always come back to this. I&#x27;ve been wearing mascara since I was about 12 or so, and I&#x27;m almost 34. This is the LEAST-clumpy mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. After using an eyelash curler, I apply this and get very very long, defined/separated lashes. I love the plastic brush, it helps &#x27;comb&#x27; the lashes.    My only complaint is that the tube tends to dry out too fast. I feel like I have to buy it more often than other brands that I&#x27;ve tried. But it&#x27;s worth it to me. Also, although I have no personal complaints about it, I will say that if you&#x27;re someone who wants a lot of volume/thickness, this isn&#x27;t your mascara. This is for people who just want length and definition!</li>
    <li> I was looking for mascara that would lengthen my lashes. For me, volume and thickness was not a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did the job without flaking or looking too unnatural.</li>
    <li> I thought I loved Carbon Black, but it was feeling a bit gloppy lately. Tried this and Hallelujah! It&#x27;s my new mascara. I&#x27;m a product queen and this is just about the only drugstore brand of cosmetic I use. Not a snob - just have done my share of research and have experience. It&#x27;s a really good mascara. I have decent, thick, long lashes, so they will sop up a thick mascara. I didn&#x27;t want that. I did want them more noticeable, longer and &amp;#34;combed&amp;#34;. This does the trick!</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara and the only mascara I&#x27;ll ever use..it&#x27;s the bestest b</li>
    <li> I like this wand for applying my mascara because it isn&#x27;t as messy. It goes on very evenly, not clumpy.</li>
    <li> I am sold on this product, it will be the ONLY mascara I use..Its not clumpy, it doesn&#x27;t run, and i can remove it with a cloth and warm water!</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara.  I had my make-up professionally done and the artist used this brand and recommended it.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is removing it.  It comes off in little chunks and pieces.</li>
