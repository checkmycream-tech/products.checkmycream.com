      <li>And it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>The prices in health food stores are often inflated for their own benefit.</li>

      <li>and WOW- it is PERFECT for my skin.  </li>
      <li>&quot; and now my complexion is near perfect.</li>
      <li>These three products together create the perfect pH and moisture level to keep my face naturally radiant.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best (natural) day &amp; night cream</li>
      <li>Honestly, with the money I&#x27;ve spent on trying to find the perfect fix I could have bought heaps of MyChelle!</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Most of the time, I don&#x27;t even put on the make-up because my face looks so naturally healthy and glowing.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this cream.</li>
      <li>Most creams moisturize the rest of my face</li>
      <li>I love it for my combination skin.  </li>
      <li>I always use toner before applying this and finish off by layering Dermalogica SPF 30 oil-free matte on top.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I used it in a Mychelle tester and fell in love.</li>
      <li>I really love this cream.</li>
      <li>I have tried many brands before, but none since.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel oily, but makes your skin look more even.  </li>
      <li>This is somewhat mattefying and keeps skin looking supple and healthy.</li>
      <li>and i love the smell and feel of the products, but i have to say that my blackhead ridden</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d tried Proactiv, which was okay but stained everything-</li>
      <li>You will be able to smell it here</li>
      <li>I love pumpkin, so this scent is heaven for me.</li>
      <li>I would compare this to a lighter, almost more whipped version of Burt&#x27;s carrot creme.</li>
      <li>and she said that the meds she had me on (doxacycline and Retin-A) should have made it somewhat better.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I find it&#x27;s great for helping my skin recover after a hormonal breakout or too much sun.</li>
      <li>I have tried the grapefruit cream and prefer that one better.</li>
      <li>many of them contain Parabens and petrochemicals...</li>
      <li>but this stuff works so much better.</li>
      <li>Will buy more and more and more...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it as an all over face cream but more as a spot treatment - anywhere on my body.  </li>
      <li>I use it on areas of healing acne, and it helps the healing better than anything else.  </li>
      <li>I want to give this 5 stars, because I love this face cream.</li>
      <li>Now i just trying to figure out if they would work better separately.  </li>
      <li>I always check on-line pricing though just to be sure.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a pretty good value.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic, goes on smooth, soaks right in and leaves skin feeling great.</li>
      <li>It has some kind of healing property for blemishes that is extraordinary.  </li>
      <li>This product smells fresh and has a nice consistency.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to get the cream out of the jar (easier than in a plastic tube), but just try to avoid being a klutz like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this cream, their brand, and many of their other products because they work great for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really wanted to like this cream but in the end it made me break out so i had to stop using it.  it is not oil-fee.</li>
    <li> I have very bad acne and I get those big deep pimples. I use to use neosporin to heal the scab after the pimple went away but this stuff works so much better. I also have very oily/dry skin and use this product morning and night. At night it heals all my acne and clears my skin and in the morning it&#x27;s a perfect moisturizer. Now instead of taking 10+ days to heal my acne it takes about 3.&lt;br /&gt;I also found this to be excellent for taking the sting out of burns. I discovered it when I went on vacation, sat out in the sun too long and the only moisturizer I had was the Pumpkin Renew Cream. The next day not only was the burn almost a tan but it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. I use it if I burn myself in the kitchen too. Put it on ASAP and you&#x27;ll still have a burn but at least it won&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream that you can use both day and night.  It doesn&#x27;t feel oily, but makes your skin look more even.  Unfortunately it is not for a very dry skin.  I wish my skin is not so dry.  If you have combination, normal or mildly dry skin, you will love this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream as it is extremely moisturizing but never greasy. It&#x27;s very rich and my skin feels great after putting it on. Many moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past were either too greasy or light and watery in which case the moisturizer didn&#x27;t feel like it was penetrating into my skin. Pumpkin Renew Cream on the other hand is deeply penetrating but never greasy and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Best of all, with MyChelle products I don&#x27;t have to worry about toxic ingredients! I strongly and enthusiastically recommend this product along with all the other MyChelle Products!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try an all natural animal friendly product, and MyChelle fit the description. I purchased the sample box before unloading a larger investment, and I&#x27;m glad I did. When I first started using the products, I noticed a change in my skin. It became more rough and itchy. I just thought it was my skin needing time to get use to the new product, so I gave it a full week and a half. I wish I would have quit using the products after the first warning signs. My face broke out in what appeared to be a rash covering my cheeks, chin, and neck. I figured it would go away in a few days after I stopped using the products, but it didn&#x27;t. I now have small, red, itchy bumps all over my face. I have never had acne, but I now know what it feels like. I highly recommend trying samples of MyChelle to make sure its compatible with your skin type. I&#x27;m not going to discredit the brand by saying don&#x27;t buy it, but you should definitely be warned that these products are not for everyone. Side effects are present even in all natural products.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without pumpkin renew cream!  Here&#x27;s my system:  wash your face with Neutrogena Oil-free Acne Wash (from Wal-Mart).  Tone your skin with Aveda&#x27;s Exfoliant (found at a spa).  Moisturize around your eyes with Oil of Olay Regenerist.  Then slather on Mychelle&#x27;s Pumpkin Renew Cream.  Wait at least 15 minutes before applying make-up.  If you wear make-up, apply bronzer to cheekbones, blush to the apples of the cheeks, and finish with a light dusting of Sheer Cover Mineral Veil (on e-bay) and do your eyes however you want.  Most of the time, I don&#x27;t even put on the make-up because my face looks so naturally healthy and glowing.  Take it from me -I took Accutane for years and had the nastiest skin on the planet - and I&#x27;ve tried absolutely every product.  This is my miracle formula!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I have really sensitive skin and break out easy. This product moistens my skin without causing breakout. Love it and would recamend it to anyone with sensitive skin seeking a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used to use this Mychelle pumpkin renew cream in its previous packaging, and I decided to try it again because I needed a new facial lotion. The effect is noticeable compared to several other lotions I&#x27;ve tried recently. My skin is smooth, NOT OILY in appearance, feels good, and helps control breakouts (I have sensitive skin). I&#x27;m wondering though, did they reduce the container size (the amount of lotion in the jar) in this redesign? It seems smaller than before. Please leave a comment to this if you happen to know. I highly recommend this product, IF YOU BUY ON AMAZON. The prices in health food stores are often inflated for their own benefit. Amazon is amazing, especially with subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I was excited to switch from ProActiv to an all natural product. I&#x27;ve been using Mychelle for over 3 months and it has made my skin worse than it ever has been before. The area around my chin and neck had insanely bad cystic acne, the kind where you press a blemish and it would hurt because of all the stuff inside (gross!) I had to go to the derma to figure how how to keep my acne at bay. At first she thought it was purely hormonal (I had a baby a little over a year ago), but I went back to her today and she said that the meds she had me on (doxacycline and Retin-A) should have made it somewhat better. I showed her the products I was using, the Clear Skin Acne cleanser, Pumpkin Renew Cream and Sun Shield. She had said that they have oil in them and are not good for my skin. So I am back to the basics with Cera-Ve and Neutrogena. I have a feeling the Mychelle products were the culprit because I had just started them when the acne began. I hope I am right and that my skin flares will go down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream on and off for 7 years. Over that time, I&#x27;ve tried at least 4 or 5 other face creams but I always come back to the pumpkin renew cream. It&#x27;s perfect for my skin. I have dry skin with flakiness around my nose. Most creams moisturize the rest of my face but I still have dry skin on the sides of my nose. With this cream, I can apply a small amount and tinted foundation and my face looks great. Over time, I can definitely tell when I&#x27;m not using this product, my face looks not only dry but dull. They make a regular scented and unscented version of the pumkin renew cream. I&#x27;ve used both and while I prefer the unscented, it&#x27;s just a personal perference type thing.   I&#x27;ve also used their deep repair, polypeptide and night cream. Those also work but have a much higher price tag. Their pumpkin peel mask is great for getting rid of dry patches of skin and also hair dye that accidently gets on your skin. Overall, I love all the Mychelle products. The only one that I thought didn&#x27;t work was the capillary calming serum.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different face lotions and creams.  This is by far my favorite.  It is so moisturizing, but not greasy.  I have combination skin and my face tends to get really dry on my cheeks.  When I use this product my skin is hydrated and looks refreshed and very healthy.  I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For the price, this doesn&#x27;t do what&#x27;s promised. I was hoping I had finally found a moisturizer that would help alleviate some of the sebum production in my skin. This does moisturize well and smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t help lower the sebum production like it led me to beleive. A decent product, but the same thing can be had for 1/5 the price.</li>
    <li> It made my skin feel oily and heavy. Unfortunately, my skin became red and blotchy, and I started to break out after use. I have tried the grapefruit cream and prefer that one better. I love all the other mychelle products (enzyme scrub and clear skin cleanser) I have tried and its too bad this one didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with MyChelle facial cleanser. The combination works really well in improving the skin care faster. MyChelle brands are highly recommended for a stress free skin care. The quality is excellent in texture and the strength of durabity. I will contiune to use their brands and try other products of my care needs.</li>
    <li> This cream smells nice and is not greasy. I use it with the MyChelle Cranberry Face Wash and it keeps my face clear! I love the MyChelle line and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good face care regimen.</li>
    <li> Mychelle is the only thing I use.  Works great, no chemicals.  Fairly priced.  I have had no skin issues since I converted.  That was about 6 months ago.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used it in a Mychelle tester and fell in love. The scent smells like a cosmetic rendition of pumpkin pie. I guess they really wanted to emphasize the pumpkin content in it. It works really well on the skin and can be used definitely day or night. I am 20 with combination skin and this works well. You only need to dip your finger in it to cover your whole face effectively - seriously, with this less is more. It really moisturizes well and that means a lot coming from me. I can definitely see this working to prevent any fine lines and wrinkles. This is somewhat mattefying and keeps skin looking supple and healthy. I really love it and surprisingly it holds up when it comes to how long it lasts. I had reservations about spending so much for a small quantity, but I use it morning and night and 6 weeks in I have half a jar left, maybe more. The scent is so light but last all day. You will be able to smell it here and there and when your washing your face off at the end of the day in the shower. It&#x27;s a gender neutral scent I would say definitely. But as a male, I like my own colognes and products so next time I purchase I will buy the unscented version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line for over 7 years now, and while I&#x27;ve tried other day moisturizers out of boredom or curiosity, I always come back to this.  Yes this is thicker for an oily skin cream, but it leaves the complexion well hydrated and dewy looking.  PUt on a layer of powder afterwards and you&#x27;ll be set for the day.  I never get breakouts from this, or irritation.  It&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
    <li> Great for combination skin, does not cause acne, smells good and goes on smooth. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. I find it&#x27;s great for helping my skin recover after a hormonal breakout or too much sun. I use it at night and by morning I find the texture of my skin much improved.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to adore this cream -- all natural, vegan, locally-owned, etc. Unfortunately the first few times I put it on my face it immediately caused an all-over reddening (which lasted). It also didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling at all moisturized -- just as tight and dry as pre-application. Shoot! I don&#x27;t know whether to try their Revitalizing Night Cream (because I like the company) or try elsewhere. For the record, I am in my early-40s with normal-dry skin, and I live at high altitude. I am religious about sun protection (both zinc-based and a hat).</li>
    <li> Consistently works for my sensitive skin.  And smells really wonderful!  I use this at night, as it does not have an SPF and use the Coconut Sun Shield product during the day.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with MyChelle products.  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have dealt with skin care issues (adult acne) for years and when I finally started researching ingredients in most of todays drugstore and even highend skincare lines- I was shocked to find out what was in them! Do the research yourself- then look at the so called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products you are using now- many of them contain Parabens and petrochemicals...I found Mychelle line on the internet and have been using them faithfully for a couple of years now- Love the whole line- especially the pumkin renew cream, Vitamin C serum, and the fruit enzyme spray, oh yeah and try the cranberry cleanser as well! Great line- great company- I&#x27;m sold! Here at amazon you can get it at 22% discount and free shipping as well.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with large pores and combination skin prone to break outs for most of my life. I have used different moisturizers and eventually  found a couple of combinations of products that work for me. After running out of my regular face cream, I decided to try this one base on a cosmetologist recommendation. This is when skin nightmare started, cystic acne came back, discoloration, dry skin. I gave it a try for three weeks, and now giving up and going back to my old face cream: derma e Pycnogenol Moisturizing Crème with Vitamins C, E, and A, 2-Ounces .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work for some people, but didn&#x27;t work for me. Made my skin considerably worse.</li>
    <li> A year ago I was struggling with terrible acne for the first time in my thirty-something life. Wanting to go a more natural, non-toxic route with my facial care products, I tried MyChelle. The Pumpkin Renew Cream is just the beginning of a line of products that not only satisfied my hope of finding a quality, natural product, but their line of Acne/Oily Skin cleansers, serums and Pumpkin Renew Cream eliminated my acne problem once and for all. Of course, I still have a zit from time to time (who doesn&#x27;t), but MyChelle products eradicated my severe acne problem so I didn&#x27;t have to begin using medication. I highly recommend MyChelle products to anyone - they are brilliant!</li>
    <li> I really like mychelle&#x27;s M.O. and i love the smell and feel of the products, but i have to say that my blackhead ridden oily but super sensitive skin has had more luck in a couple of weeks with oatmeal soap, castor oil and j/a/s/o/n wild yam moisturizing cream which all together costs about $10, compared to the perfect c serum and pumpkin renew cream for about $50 that i used until the products ran out. if you have $$ this moisturizer is nice; not too heavy or greasy, but i think if you have problem skin, deep moisture is really important and this cream is very light and you have to use alot of it. I think if you really wanted to see results, you should try the oil cleansing method, with occasional peels for scars and retinol for extreme blackheads.</li>
    <li> I have always had difficult skin - sensitive, breakouts, dry in spots. I am 47 and live in a dry climate and this stuff is amazing. It smells fantastic, goes on smooth, soaks right in and leaves skin feeling great. I get compliments on my skin all the time now.</li>
    <li> I had been getting super dry, eczema like areas behind my ears, and I couldn&#x27;t find anything to soothe it.  But THIS did the trick, brilliantly!  I also, like many of the other reviewers, am susceptible to acne and cystic acne but this formula never was the cause.  I use it on areas of healing acne, and it helps the healing better than anything else.  I don&#x27;t use it as an all over face cream but more as a spot treatment - anywhere on my body.  My skin can also be very sensitive and reactive, and sometimes this cream soothes better than cortisone cream.  This is a staple in my regimen!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half now, and I really like it. I tend to be very oily so I only use it at night, but it only takes a tiny amount to moisturize my entire face. This cream doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores like others I&#x27;ve used, but if I use it twice a day I do get breakouts. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, so anything I put on my face tends to make me breakout, but I&#x27;ve found that if I use it in conjunction with Clarifying Synergy (a natural oil blend from another company), I have no problems and virtually no breakouts for the past month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell may be unpleasant to some- it smells like patchouli to me, even though that&#x27;s not listed in the ingredients. I usually find patchouli to be a very unpleasant scent, but in this cream I don&#x27;t mind the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer- and with the amount I use this container is going to last me about six months, so it&#x27;s a pretty good value. One of the best benefits is that it&#x27;s free of any parabens or a ton of chemical additives.</li>
    <li> This cream is great for night use. It is a little heavy for daytime, unless its very dry outside. BUT, when used at night in the morning my skin looks amazing, and the look lasts all day. My pores look smoother, my tone looks even, and I even \\&quot;glow\\&quot; a bit, a new thing for me!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened. I used samples of this product last yr. and liked it. I just recently bought the regular size of this product and used it for 2 weeks and it dried out my skin, it also made my skin peel and feel very tight. They had to of changed the formula. Needless to say I am returning this product along with the Deep Repair and Supreme Polypeptide which also dried out my face, made it peel, and broke me out. I am 49 yrs. old and have not had a problem with pimples in years until using these products. I even had my daughter to use the Pumpkin Renew, because she liked the smell. Well, it broke her skin out and made her peel also. She said it felt like her face was burning.</li>
    <li> Not any better than any other cream I have tried.  Sm all jar.</li>
    <li> I had problems with adult onset acne and had tried everything but still had bumps. I already was eating organic and living a pretty green lifestyle so naturally I came across the Mychelle products in various places, in stores and online, and I decided to give it a try. I am so happy I did. Immediately after use I noticed my skin had \\&quot;calmed down\\&quot; and now my complexion is near perfect. I owe it all to this product as well as Mychelle&#x27;s cranberry face wash and fruit enzyme spray. These three products together create the perfect pH and moisture level to keep my face naturally radiant. It really works! And best of all it is free of nasty harsh toxic chemicals that you find in most face products.</li>
    <li> I like the MyChelle line of products...Overall, I find that they are high quality and effective in delivering the intended results.  I find this particular cream to be a bit oily for daytime use, but I love using it at night. I have slightly oily skin and I live in southeast Texas (hot &amp; humid), so it can contribute to an already \\&quot;oily\\&quot; situation on my face.  I may use it during the day during cold months or if I visit cooler/dry areas. Its definitely staying on my nighttime face care line-up!</li>
    <li> My esthetician replaced my original organic cream with this one months ago so that I could try it out.  Imediatly loved the smell but was worried that the fragrance would affect me... it didn&#x27;t.  Its been a great replacement and at an incredible price... i&#x27;ve spent so much more on lotions in the past.  This leaves my face soft and supple, but not oily and doesn&#x27;t make me break out - kudos for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the order very quickly and it was exactly the same as the one I bought from my esthetician.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Good cream, love putting it on at night.  Makes your face glow in the AM.</li>
    <li> This is the best face moisturizer! I have been using it for a few years now. When I tried to switch to a different product I switched back. It smells wonderful, is not greasy and works well for my combination skin. I rarely break out anymore like I used to. Now that I am over 50 it is working well for older skin. Downside is it does not have sunscreen but that is ok since I avoid sunbathing or long periods of sun exposure. Will use it forever.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  My skin looks way younger since I started using natural skin care with MyChelle.  This hydrates my skin like no other  and I have tried a lot of anti-aging products.  It has reduced some sun damage and a lot of my wrinkles from the sun appear to be smoother and / or gone.  I use this in combo with the eye cream and the crows feet are gone around my eyes!  Can&#x27;t say enough about MyChelle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s, have combination skin, and a crazy schedule. As I slacked in my beauty routine, I noticed my skin was dreary, blotchy, saggy, and starting to wrinkle. So, I started using Mychelle products after years of researching for cruelty free and non-toxic ingredients (a couple questionable ingredients in some of their products, but overall pretty good). This pumpkin cream smells great, absorbs quickly and gently, and really does make my skin feel healthier and look better. However, a friend referred me to this website and their organic anti-aging and personal care lines - [...] - and while I&#x27;ll still continue to use Mychelle for makeup, the ingredients in this Beyond Organic line are the purest I&#x27;ve come across and the results have been much more dramatic so I prefer those. While they&#x27;re pricier, they are worth it (plus they have discounts and buy one/get one black friday/cyber monday sales too).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with oily skin, so I was always  told by dermatologists that I required a clarifying moisturizer of sorts (something with Salicylic Acid).  My skin has never improved ... until THIS product!  Not only has almost ALL of my oiliness disappeared, but my skin tone has evened out and I LOVE the feel of my skin!  I&#x27;ll never go without this product from here on out!</li>
    <li> This product smells fresh and has a nice consistency. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s, and my skin is getting more sensitive. I had read about this line of products and about how natural they are. I was hopeful that this cream would both moisturize and not irritate my skin, but my redness got worse over time and I had to stop using it. I&#x27;m still searching for that all natural product that won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Skin feels great.  I love it for my combination skin.  Skin feels smooth, hydrated but not oily.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  The price is right. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Once again, Amazon proves it&#x27;s worth to consumers, providing the opportunity for free shipping when the company website doesn&#x27;t.  We like this product very much - it is non-greasy and non-comodegenic, you can select a fragrance-free version as well.  Excellent value and reliable delivery earn this store very high marks from me.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> On my never-ending quest for finding effective natural products, this is one of my favorites! I&#x27;m usually hesitant to try anything that&#x27;s not oil-free but I&#x27;ve been using this as my daily moisturiser for almost 3 months. I&#x27;m impressed with how soothing this cream is and how it does not make me break out (oily/acne prone skin). This cream helps my skin heal faster with its nourishing properties: in the winter I use it on under my nose, and occasionally on dried up acne spots. I always use toner before applying this and finish off by layering Dermalogica SPF 30 oil-free matte on top. It&#x27;s the best (natural) day &amp; night cream I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> IT BURNT WHEN I PUT IT ON, BUT I MUST SAY I HAVE FRAGILE SENSITIVE ALLERGY PRONE SKIN, ALTHOUGH ORGANIC YOUR PRODUCTS DO NOT AGREE WITH MY SKIN. I HAVE TRIED A FEW OF THEM. HAD TO GIVE THEM AWAY, I WILL STICK TO JUICE BEAUTY CK</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for two weeks and my skin has already shown so much improvement, it&#x27;s insane!  I have combination, acne-prone skin; it&#x27;s usually oily with various dry spots, mainly on my forehead. No moisturizer I&#x27;ve used in the past year has worked as well as the Pumpkin Renew Cream.  Plus, it smells great! :)</li>
    <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve been using it since I first found it at about 45 y.o. &amp; I&#x27;m at least another 10 yrs + since my first try/buy of the products.  Over the yrs my skin has changed (not as much as my mom&#x27;s ;-)  but it has changed - just not at all much compared to others I know at similar ages.  Overall, I&#x27;m real happy as folks normally guess me much younger than my years.&lt;br /&gt;I did shift from the early days of using the main products to now using the next level up, so...still looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not reaching for the spackle just yet....  ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many natural/organic facial moisturizers with high hopes for each and every one of them but they all seemed to irritate my skin in one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a trip I forgot my moisturizer so bought a small sample size of this and WOW- it is PERFECT for my skin.  It is so balancing- it moisturizes but does not make my skin oily.  I use it day and night.  I haven&#x27;t broken out once using this, so it is great for my acne prone skin. I&#x27;m really happy with it and think the price is very reasonable for the product- one jar easily lasts 3 months since it is so thick.</li>
    <li> Let me start by stating that I rarely write reviews. I feel like I really need to write about this stuff, though. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and had recently resigned to never having nice skin. Enter MyChelle Dermaceuticals. My skin is looking SO much better!! Between this and the pumpkin cream, my skin is almost 100% improved. I&#x27;d tried Proactiv, which was okay but stained everything- sheets, shirts, towels, the lot. I used Oil of Olay, and still do sometimes, but the daily facial wipes were just getting too expensive to use twice a day and I still had forehead bumps. Honestly, with the money I&#x27;ve spent on trying to find the perfect fix I could have bought heaps of MyChelle! I&#x27;m not going to make this long, but please, if you&#x27;re feeling bummed and lost with your skin, give this a try. Don&#x27;t jump into the deep end, as it can be expensive, but get a starter kit or just a couple things and see how you go. I&#x27;m going to post the same thing for the face wash. Good luck!</li>
    <li> LOVE how this makes my complexion feel!</li>
    <li> I am on my 5th jar of this cream! Usually I have to change moisturizers because they start to irritate my skin after using them for a while, but so far so good with this cream. It is a heavier cream and has been great for my dry skin, and a little goes a long way. It does have a slight pleasant fragrance that I would not call patchouli, as another reviewer did. I am very sensitive to smells and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all--can&#x27;t smell it at all on my face after it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like Mychelle line,its smells fabulous, and i like the stoty behind. I am using the entire line, the first week my skin just glowed, but after i&#x27;ve got all my pores clogged and my skin never looked worst,red pimples on my jawline. Now i just trying to figure out if they would work better separately.  i still hope it will work out</li>
    <li> I use this cream every Fall and Winter.  It is perfect.  Not too heavy or greasy yet still moisturizing.  It has some kind of healing property for blemishes that is extraordinary.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It has a very nice smell that isn&#x27;t over powering.  I also use the Mychelle cleanser and fruit enzyme scrub.</li>
    <li> I found MyChelle line about a year ago and use the scrub every morning to clean my face and at night to moisturize my face.  The night time moisturizer is nice.  When I was in Boulder, CO last Fall I ran out of the moisturizer I brought with me and went to Whole Foods and bought this.  As you may or may not know in the mountain dry climate with the elevation it can really dry out your skin.  A year later I still use this line.  So that is a true testament to how much I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though you can buy this line in any Whole Foods Store or similar type stores buying it on Amazon can usually get you better prices.  I always check on-line pricing though just to be sure.</li>
    <li> I looked all over for decent skin cream and this is the purest I can find that works. Mychelle is great stuff</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel amazingly soft without leaving a greasy feeling. I definitely noticed that my skin feels better since using this product. And it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I want to give this 5 stars, because I love this face cream. It smells great (I love pumpkin anyway), it&#x27;s absorbed by the skin (though you can&#x27;t put on too much, it&#x27;ll just roll off), and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry. However, I suspect it is what is giving me pimples. I am using other MyChelle face products but this might be too heavy for my face for everyday use. Maybe I need to switch to using it just at night.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious and is always my favourite skin cream for normal, every day use. I never break out from it, and even though I have sensitive skin, I haven&#x27;t had to switch to the fragrance-free version. I&#x27;ve often received compliments about how good I smell when I&#x27;ve just applied it a few hours previously and hug my friends.</li>
    <li> I use it with MyChelle Hydrating Serum, and it work very well for me. I have combination skin, it gets oily and dry. The cream absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. My skin feels hydrated and less shinny. I really like it this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have used this skin cream everyday for the past 5 years and haven&#x27;t had the need to try another one. I had a little bit of acne and I found this cream clears it up, keeps my skin soft and moisturized, but never oily. I only get a few acne spots when I experience some hormonal changes, which seems unavoidable and no product can change that. I do believe this is the perfect cream. I have tried many brands before, but none since. MyChelle&#x27;s other creams work decently, too, but left my skin feeling more oily, so I use this one for both night and day. I use the Pumpkin Renew Cream in combination with their White&#x27;Cranberry Cleanser and the variety of face masks they offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love this cream, their brand, and many of their other products because they work great for me. Every skin type is different so your experience might not be the same. Just for comparison I have fair-pinky skin with a tendency to be on the dry side with an oily T-zone area. This moisturizes for me and tends to even out my skin tone. The first day I used it someone mentioned my skin was glowing, which is totally cliche about skin creams, but this one really did it for me and years later still does.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cream. It&#x27;s very dry where I live, and my skin just soaks this up! It doesn&#x27;t burn, it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and it is very smoothing and helps diminish lines on my face. My skin is plumped up! I love the scent, and I really think it&#x27;s evening out my complexion. My BF even uses it every morning and has no issues with it being too thick or feeling it on his skin. I also LOVE the Supreme Polypeptide for night use, and that has totally helped smooth away the fine lines. Thank you MyChelle for another FABO product!!</li>
    <li> I really love this cream. I love pumpkin, so this scent is heaven for me. The product does a great job of moisturizing my skin at night. I don&#x27;t use it as a day cream because it balls up when makeup is applied to it. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a good night cream this is it.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Mychelle pumpkin renew UNSCENTED, which actually has a light and heavenly scent, but I accidently ordered this one instead. If you have delicate skin or are sensitive to perfumes, you will want the unscented formula.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream and other MyChelle products for about 2 years now. I used to change creams and cleansers frequently, because I never found one that worked, did not irritate my skin and that I really liked. The cream is very hydrating, it also is a wonderful cream to use in summer for people who find other creams too heavy.</li>
    <li> great product! Fast shipper!</li>
    <li> evened out my skin tone and helped with controlling the oil that i produce. also made my skin really soft. I prefer this over other mychelle creams</li>
    <li> I have been using MyChelle products for about 7 years now. I have never looked back. This cream is wonderful. It&#x27;s very nourishing.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what is actually in this stuff, but wow it made my dry hypothyroid skin (on my face) glow :-) So happy. Will buy more and more and more...</li>
    <li> this face cream is worth the $. it&#x27;s my go to and has helped fade my sunspots and filled in some lines I&#x27;d been worried about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit it: other than the lack of parabens and chemicals, I was attracted to Mychelle&#x27;s pumpkin products because I love all things pumpkin. From food to candles, I&#x27;m a sucker for the gourd. Imagine my pleasant surprise, though, when I came to love this one! I have previously used various moisturizers from Kiss My Face and Burt&#x27;s Bees. I would compare this to a lighter, almost more whipped version of Burt&#x27;s carrot creme. They both are fantastic for dry winter skin (I get particularly dry around my nose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the Burt&#x27;s this product does take a little while to absorb, but I found it much less greasy than the Burt&#x27;s. Mychelle offers this cream in an unscented version, but honestly the scent of the regular is quite mild and pleasant. Not at all like a baked good! The color is a mild light green, and I find one pot lasts a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be the packaging, and it&#x27;s not enough to warrant removing a star. I dropped the glass jar once on my bathroom floor, and needless to say it was toast. It&#x27;s easy to get the cream out of the jar (easier than in a plastic tube), but just try to avoid being a klutz like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I bought my Mychelle products from online skincare retailers when they offered a coupon code. Amazon&#x27;s subscribe &amp; save price has them beat!</li>
    <li> If I were to rate this cream a year and a half ago, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. I used it for 5 years and absolutely loved it. I bought it for my friends as gifts and told everyone about it. But then sometime last year the formula changed and now I get cysts on my face. I was in total denial when it happened that it could be this cream, so I stopped and started using it 4 times to be sure. I know that soy derived ingredients can do this to me as well as Acai. This new formula has both.  I did not purchase this from Amazon. I purchased it through Vitamin Cottage.</li>
    <li> I always use this product in the winter. I love the smell and it&#x27;s very moisturizing. No animal testing. Can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I really like the MyChelle product line and I especially like this Pumpkin Renew cream. It goes on easily and is not greasy. It just disappears into skin leaving a \\&quot;glow.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel younger. I use it after the spray and serum. I also use their cleanser and scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly reommend this cream and the entire MyChelle product line.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I have eczema and am allergic to a lot of products. This one seems to work under my chapped skin, so the new skin comes out nice and soft. Also, this is about the same price as their website, but since I have Prime, my shipping was free.</li>
    <li> Perfect product, good price.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I think it will be better suited for summer.  It&#x27;s not quite as thick and emollient as I&#x27;d like for winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the pumpkin smell, which does not smell fake like something overly fragranced from Bath &amp; Body Works.  I like that it&#x27;s made with real ingredients and healthy for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second purchase of this product and I see myself making the purchase again!</li>
    <li> the best always!&lt;br /&gt;http://photographicarteditions.blogspot.com/2015/07/mychelle-skin-care-line-for-fabulous.html</li>
