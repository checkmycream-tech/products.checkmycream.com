<li> I generally stick to base colors (browns, tans, grey, and black) and this trio is one of my favorites and a staple in my make-up bag.</li>
<li> I rarely use the pink/brown contour color, but I use the base and definer almost every time I wear make up.</li>

    <li> I generally stick to base colors (browns, tans, grey, and black) and this trio is one of my favorites and a staple in my make-up bag.

The defining brush is small-but works great with the dark definer.  None of the shads are a really shimmery eye shadow, which is excellent for me (I prefer matte)-the Buttered Bronze is not a true matte with hints of shimmer in it.

    <li> I got an awsome deal on this color pallete from Clinique here on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it! I love the colors. Plums and mauves have always looked nice with my complexion and these are perfect! I use clinique&#x27;s 3 step system for acne and Perfectly Real foundation and I found this blush and eyeshadow to the be the perfect complement to those. Thanks, Amazon for the amazing bargain!</li>
    <li> It  is wHat I expected... OK combination of colors...  wouldn&#x27;t necessarily buy it again.  would like other colors more than this</li>
    <li> The item arrived within two days after ordering.  The item was as advertized and I was satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I choosed that because was a real good product.&lt;br /&gt;Was my good choose.&lt;br /&gt;I recomended that..!!&lt;br /&gt;Excelente brand for many years</li>
    <li> I have used the Clinique brand before and I have never been let down. The colors seem to stay on longer than other brands.</li>
    <li> Clinique is a good product line, and I bought this because I like the colors. However, I guess it was such a good price because it is old. I have to scrape the top of the powder to make it soft enough to go onto the brush. That said, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be inferior in any other way.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I recommend it to everyone. ideal to wear in the portfolio and meet the requirements, beautiful colors.&lt;br /&gt;great brand</li>
    <li> Loved this item.  It protects and works great with the any colored skin.  I ordered this item in alot of colors and everyone ask where did i get them. Good product and glad I bought the case.</li>
    <li> perfect in my purse and takes care of my personal needs, with all products in one little area. I recommend to all friends.</li>
    <li> Excelente marca para las personas con algún tipo de alergias, con colores muy de moda y con práctico estuche fácil de llevar a viajes</li>
    <li> Great pick. My wife loved it</li>
    <li> Love this product. You have a blush, lilac eyeshadow and a gray shadow.  This one is a keeper&lt;br /&gt;and the price was reasonable. Great for those with sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> when I got this in the mail, i was very upset, since this was not what I ordered, instead I got different shades of color, not what I was looking for at all</li>
    <li> It was wrapped in a paper towel and was not sealed in anyway. Made me worry it was used or tampered with.</li>
