      <li>They sanitize and calm.</li>
      <li>The peppermint scent is also nice, I personally like it, but if I were to offer one to a friend, I think the peppermint is a stronger scent that some people might not like.</li>
      <li>Bit pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>I buy these for my grand daughter on a regular basis.  </li>
      <li>really like these.</li>

      <li>The towlettes are large enough to get the job done.</li>
      <li>For a &amp;#34;wet nap&amp;#34; they are very classy looking and the packaging is sturdy, so they never dry out if, for example, you keep them in the car.</li>

    <li> Love these.  I wipe these over my upper body if I have to change mid-day.  Have also used on feet.  They make you feel very refreshed.</li>
    <li> I take these with me whenever I fly. They sanitize and calm. Smell great!</li>
    <li> I love these - I brought them in to work to refresh me during the day.  The towelettes are very sturdy and soft. They smell so genuinely of lavender and they just make me smile whenever I use them.</li>
