      <li>Good:  </li>
      <li>and it keeps the hair away for a good 4-6wks.</li>
      <li>I loved Epilady Legend....</li>
      <li>In fact one of the great things with an epilator is that you should be able to use it on shorter hair, hence its advantage over waxing.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m immured to the pain after all these years, but I can honestly state that with the Epilady wet-dry</li>
      <li>Worked great for a month then had to return the first one.</li>
      <li>This product is phenomenal.  </li>
      <li>love having two heads</li>
      <li>Loved this product to begin with... worked great but have had to send it back twice because it quits working with no warning.  </li>
      <li>I love the Epilady.</li>
      <li>The EP920 costs around $30 more than the Panasonic.</li>
      <li>What more could a girl want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>1st use it all over, love it, love it.</li>
      <li>just wish it would have worked better.</li>
      <li>However, there should be a better battery life and gage if that&#x27;s the case.</li>
      <li>It does the job cleanly, effectively, and quickly.  </li>
      <li>I do love that it has a light and interchangeable heads.</li>
      <li>And if it&#x27;s like any of the other Epilady products I&#x27;ve had over the years, it willremain reliable and in perfect working order for years and</li>
      <li>I was fine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so great at English</li>
      <li>It is simply fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Since there is no return available on this item, I am out of luck.</li>
      <li>light</li>
      <li>Easy to clean, portable.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d have happily kept the product if that were the only trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The review below was originally entitled \\&quot;The Queen of</li>
      <li>, it took me a couple of time using it to find the right angle, but after that everything is fine.</li>
      <li>but it was a cool idea...</li>
      <li>razor also runs out of a charge rather quickly.</li>
      <li>so I can rinse or clean one and use the other, but I don&#x27;t think this epilator is a good investment even with all the bells and whistles.</li>
      <li>so i&#x27;ve been waxing and using an epilator since i was 15 years old, so more than 15 years.</li>
      <li>Technically correct just makes for an amusing read.</li>
      <li>After all, that&#x27;s all Epilady do, right?  </li>
      <li>At first the experience was horriable, but once I go use to it</li>
      <li>fact that the brochure is written in English--obviously by someone well educated in the language but who just doesn&#x27;t have the grasp of the proper usage of many the words--</li>
      <li>This epilator seeme to hurt a lot less, but I also don&#x27;t think it was pulling very many hairs out per square inch.  </li>
      <li>I love that the hair does not grow back as fast as it does when you use a razor.</li>
      <li>You can go over a patch with the Panasonic over, and over, and over again,  and it will still leave hairs behind, and I can honestly say that with the Panasonic I have never completed an epilation session feeling satisfied that the job was done.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And although this price is probably justified by all the extra heads and gizmos, I don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll be using them.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore.  </li>
      <li>, I figured they must be working on coming up with a real slam dunk of a product that would knock the others out of the park.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping that this would work for me, because shaving really is a pain in the butt.</li>
      <li>Either I do not know how to use an epilator, or this product does not work very well for me.</li>
      <li>My very costly mistake.</li>
      <li>very dissapointed with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on products, but in this case, maybe I can save someone else from wasting their money.</li>
      <li>It worked great the two times I was able to use it, but two times of usage isn&#x27;t worth the $80+ spent on this piece of crap machinery.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this safety feature is the reason that the device seems to hurt less, but it means that with the concave shape of the head you can&#x27;t get short</li>
      <li>After spending nearly $80 on an item, I expect it to run longer than 5 months.</li>
      <li>I never used it in water, let it die completely each time as suggested in the manual, and converted from waxing so</li>
      <li>It acts like it just needs to be recharged but is completely locked up.  </li>
      <li>I have replaced it with a Braun Epil 7, which so far (fingers and toes crossed)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not being rude, I&#x27;m sure I can&#x27;t translate my language into theirs, but no one is paying me to either.</li>
      <li>But I still think paying the extra $30 was well worth the money, because this product actually gets the job done.</li>
      <li>I have ordered from Amazon for a very long time, and this is the first time I have not had a satisfactory outcome.  </li>
      <li>Does not get the small fine hairs.</li>
      <li>The tiny light on the epilator is fantastic and let&#x27;s you see all the hairs that you are missing and you will be missing a lot.  </li>
      <li>well, one in particular took nearly a dozen tries each time I tried to use it.</li>
      <li>Short hairs are a problem for this model and they weren&#x27;t with my old Braun.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to pull the fine hairs out and misses quite a few, but perhaps this is inability to use it correctly on my part and the hair may not be quite long enough.  </li>

<li> /&gt;Do not buy this machine complete waste of money</li>
<li> only , must-be plugged in $35 Braun epilator for years and was so excited to get a new cordless wet/dry epilator, but I&#x27;ve been really disappointed with this model&#x27;s performance.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for a very very long time and have never had this issue before.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a dry</li>
<li> Did a goo job for about 1 week then down hill after that until total stop.</li>
<li> Can be used wet or dry</li>
<li> so when I found this one that was wet and dry...</li>
<li> I find myself doing little spot treatments daily rather than one spot every 4-6wks.</li>
<li> It does the job as expected.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Pain?  As I said, I&#x27;ve been using electric epilators for 20 years now, and the pain element is really not an issue for me.  </li>
<li> gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it on my thighs (where I don&#x27;t normally epilate or shave) and found relatively weak results there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Also, short or long it has a hard time pulling hairs out, when it doesn&#x27;t break them.</li>
<li> I have thick hair on my leg sand typically epilate every two weeks, which menas the hairs are typically relative short.  </li>
<li> Amazon sent a new one late Jan. and now it too is dead, Mar 2014.</li>
<li> : doesn&#x27;t remove short hairs, thick hairs, or very long hairs</li>
<li> Received for a birthday present in late October and it stopped working by Christmas</li>
<li> It lasted less than two weeks.</li>
<li> It is in the implementation where the trouble lies.&lt;br</li>
<li> Had this epilady for a few weeks before it just stopped working.</li>
<li> can&#x27;t speak for all brands, but while waiting for Epilady to launch their wet-dry product, I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic for the past couple years and, frankly, with the Panasonic it would be quicker to pull out my hairs one by one with a tweezer.  </li>
<li> I like the epilady so much, no more waxing</li>
<li> , my Epilady lasted a mere six months, became slower and slower (yes, I WAS recharging it, before you ask), and finally expired.  </li>
<li> But sadly, my  Epilady \\&quot;queen\\&quot; died after a very short reign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> so you can see what you are doing, battery has lasts for 40 minutes, doesn&#x27;t slow down with wet legs, less painful than my other model, a bevy of attachments</li>
<li> I the only one tired of poorly made products that don&#x27;t begin to deliver as advertised?</li>
<li> Stop working literally after 4 uses, worthless product don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> Do not buy this unless you want to be fully frustrated at poor workmanship and lack of customer care.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t use it when it&#x27;s on the charger either which is inconvenient as well.  </li>
<li> still painful for me, I just need to get use to it.</li>
<li> razor heads didn&#x27;t snap onto the base</li>
<li> Very bad epilator, does not pull out hair</li>
<li> so disappointed!</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> /&gt;It was the Worst!!!!!</li>

<ol>
    <li> At first the experience was horriable, but once I go use to it I was fine.  I love that the hair does not grow back as fast as it does when you use a razor.</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipped in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Good:  light so you can see what you are doing, battery has lasts for 40 minutes, doesn&#x27;t slow down with wet legs, less painful than my other model, a bevy of attachments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: doesn&#x27;t remove short hairs, thick hairs, or very long hairs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a dry only , must-be plugged in $35 Braun epilator for years and was so excited to get a new cordless wet/dry epilator, but I&#x27;ve been really disappointed with this model&#x27;s performance.  The tiny light on the epilator is fantastic and let&#x27;s you see all the hairs that you are missing and you will be missing a lot.  I have thick hair on my leg sand typically epilate every two weeks, which menas the hairs are typically relative short.  Short hairs are a problem for this model and they weren&#x27;t with my old Braun.  This epilator seeme to hurt a lot less, but I also don&#x27;t think it was pulling very many hairs out per square inch.  The device has an automatic shutoff that prevents you from applying any pressure to your leg with the epilator.  I&#x27;m sure this safety feature is the reason that the device seems to hurt less, but it means that with the concave shape of the head you can&#x27;t get short hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it on my thighs (where I don&#x27;t normally epilate or shave) and found relatively weak results there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love having two heads so I can rinse or clean one and use the other, but I don&#x27;t think this epilator is a good investment even with all the bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> Very bad epilator, does not pull out hair just seems it breaks the hair. Does not get the small fine hairs. Stop working literally after 4 uses, worthless product don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I loved Epilady Legend.... so when I found this one that was wet and dry... My heart melted.&lt;br /&gt;It was the Worst!!!!! Because it was epilady... I threw out the box... My very costly mistake. I will say, however... I do love that it has a light and interchangeable heads. Perhaps; having the interchangeable heads is the problem... I don&#x27;t know... I&#x27;m no engineer... but it was a cool idea... just wish it would have worked better.</li>
    <li> so i&#x27;ve been waxing and using an epilator since i was 15 years old, so more than 15 years. The battery has to be fully charged to work. It will not function if plugged in. I&#x27;m assuming this is a safety feature as its a wet/dry epilator. However, there should be a better battery life and gage if that&#x27;s the case. Also, short or long it has a hard time pulling hairs out, when it doesn&#x27;t break them. I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for a very very long time and have never had this issue before. In fact one of the great things with an epilator is that you should be able to use it on shorter hair, hence its advantage over waxing.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m very dissapointed with this purchase. And obviously as i&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;m stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this machine complete waste of money</li>
    <li> Christmas present for the wife. Worked great for a month then had to return the first one. Amazon sent a new one late Jan. and now it too is dead, Mar 2014. Now we can&#x27;t return it via Amazon so we have to go thru Epilady. Bummer! I can&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Loved this product to begin with... worked great but have had to send it back twice because it quits working with no warning.  It acts like it just needs to be recharged but is completely locked up.  You can&#x27;t use it when it&#x27;s on the charger either which is inconvenient as well.  I&#x27;m done with this product... so disappointed!</li>
    <li> the product works very good. still painful for me, I just need to get use to it.</li>
    <li> The idea of this razor is terrific--the multiple heads for multiple purposes--the fact that you can use it in water (for a supposedly closer shave). It is in the implementation where the trouble lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the brochure is written in English--obviously by someone well educated in the language but who just doesn&#x27;t have the grasp of the proper usage of many the words--did not help at all. Technically correct just makes for an amusing read. I&#x27;m not being rude, I&#x27;m sure I can&#x27;t translate my language into theirs, but no one is paying me to either. (Although I&#x27;d be happy to give it a go if they want to.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor heads didn&#x27;t snap onto the base well, one in particular took nearly a dozen tries each time I tried to use it. The razor portion itself just doesn&#x27;t cut well at all. It does run in water, but that just means it tugs and bounces over the leg as you go--still not shaving well and patchily (is that a word? I&#x27;m not so great at English either I guess) at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor also runs out of a charge rather quickly. One charge made it through a determined attempt over one and a half legs, with it steadily growing weaker and weaker. The Epilady heads--were also patchy, but that I think is the nature of the beast and I&#x27;d have happily kept the product if that were the only trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I the only one tired of poorly made products that don&#x27;t begin to deliver as advertised? So I sent it back and my hunt for a functional razor continues. Any ideas? Anybody? Bueller? Bueller?</li>
    <li> I like the epilady so much, no more waxing, it took me a couple of time using it to find the right angle, but after that everything is fine. Easy to clean, portable. Can be used wet or dry I already reccomended to some firends.</li>
    <li> Either I do not know how to use an epilator, or this product does not work very well for me. I have been using this product for several months now and it will not pull up all my hair. Whatever it does pull up comes back within a week. I was hoping that this would work for me, because shaving really is a pain in the butt.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after a very short period of time. Did a goo job for about 1 week then down hill after that until total stop.</li>
    <li> This product is phenomenal.  I give it 10 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> It does the job as expected.  Possibly the only thing I can&#x27;t say it good it&#x27;s the battery -I feel like I have to constantly charge the battery; even when I charge it before use it sometimes dies while using it.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it fulfills it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> just received it. 1st use it all over, love it, love it. love it.</li>
    <li> I received this around May 20th of 2014. It is now Sept 12, 2014 and the product has stopped working. After spending nearly $80 on an item, I expect it to run longer than 5 months. Since there is no return available on this item, I am out of luck. I would warn any one thinking of purchasing this product, DO NOT.  While it was working, it was not the quality I had come to expect of an Epilady, having owned one for several years prior to this purchase. This is showing 2 stars, however I give it NO stars. Very disappointed. I have ordered from Amazon for a very long time, and this is the first time I have not had a satisfactory outcome.  I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on products, but in this case, maybe I can save someone else from wasting their money.</li>
    <li> The review below was originally entitled \\&quot;The Queen of Epilators\\&quot; and I gave it 5 stars. But sadly, my  Epilady \\&quot;queen\\&quot; died after a very short reign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I have been using electric epilators for 20 years, and the Epilady was always my go-to brand.  So when companies started bringing out wet-dry epilators and Epilady had not come up with one, I figured they must be working on coming up with a real slam dunk of a product that would knock the others out of the park.  After all, that&#x27;s all Epilady do, right?  Produce epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for all brands, but while waiting for Epilady to launch their wet-dry product, I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic for the past couple years and, frankly, with the Panasonic it would be quicker to pull out my hairs one by one with a tweezer.  You can go over a patch with the Panasonic over, and over, and over again,  and it will still leave hairs behind, and I can honestly say that with the Panasonic I have never completed an epilation session feeling satisfied that the job was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, at last, we have the Epilady wet-dry.  It is simply fabulous.  It does the job cleanly, effectively, and quickly.  No more going over and over and over the same hairs - this baby takes them out the first time.  What more could a girl want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain?  As I said, I&#x27;ve been using electric epilators for 20 years now, and the pain element is really not an issue for me.  Maybe I&#x27;m immured to the pain after all these years, but I can honestly state that with the Epilady wet-dry I felt not a thing - not even under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price?  The EP920 costs around $30 more than the Panasonic. And although this price is probably justified by all the extra heads and gizmos, I don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll be using them. But I still think paying the extra $30 was well worth the money, because this product actually gets the job done. And if it&#x27;s like any of the other Epilady products I&#x27;ve had over the years, it willremain reliable and in perfect working order for years and years.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my Epilady lasted a mere six months, became slower and slower (yes, I WAS recharging it, before you ask), and finally expired.  I have replaced it with a Braun Epil 7, which so far (fingers and toes crossed) I absolutely adore.  Let&#x27;s hope I don&#x27;t have to eat my words in six months&#x27; time...</li>
    <li> Had this epilady for a few weeks before it just stopped working. Can hear it WANTING to work when you put it close to your ear (can hear something inside whining). It worked great the two times I was able to use it, but two times of usage isn&#x27;t worth the $80+ spent on this piece of crap machinery. Do not buy this if you value your money. Do not buy this unless you want to be fully frustrated at poor workmanship and lack of customer care.</li>
    <li> I love the Epilady. I use it once a day and it keeps the hair away for a good 4-6wks. I have no issues at this point. I don&#x27;t have any hairs anywhere else that need removal. I find myself doing little spot treatments daily rather than one spot every 4-6wks. This process keeps all my unwanted hair away 6wks at a time. 😆</li>
    <li> It lasted less than two weeks.I never used it in water, let it die completely each time as suggested in the manual, and converted from waxing so the hair was already sparse.We&#x27;ll see how the warranty fulfillment goes but the product is junk.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to pull the fine hairs out and misses quite a few, but perhaps this is inability to use it correctly on my part and the hair may not be quite long enough.  The instruction sheet is lacking information on what length hair to use it on.  I still think waxing is better, but maybe time will prove me wrong.</li>
    <li> Received for a birthday present in late October and it stopped working by Christmas</li>
