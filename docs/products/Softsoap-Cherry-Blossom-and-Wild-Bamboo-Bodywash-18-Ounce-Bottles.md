      <li>But I liked it as well.</li>
      <li>, although this one smells really nice I&#x27;ll leave it for my guests &amp; use up the orange one.</li>
      <li>I felt like I had taken a trip to a nice Island.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love love love this product!!</li>
      <li>This is the best and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The product smells good and foams great and comes in a decent size bottle.  </li>

      <li>Just soft, wonderful skin.</li>

      <li>ok..</li>
      <li>I love love LOVE this smell.  </li>
      <li>I love this body wash.  </li>
      <li>soap is definately my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of the mix of cherry and bamboo.</li>
      <li>I really loved Softsoap&#x27;s pomegranate and mango bodywash even though the fragrance was really citrusy grapefruit, but Softsoap&#x27;s cherry blossom bodywash is not my cup of tea.  </li>
      <li>I cleans nicely and leaves you smelling wonderfully fresh.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS SOFT-SOAP, I TRIED SEVERAL BRANDS, BUT THIS IS THE BEST BRAND, THANKS.</li>
      <li>A lot of soap for the price I needed a certain kind.</li>
      <li>1/2 the price and free</li>
      <li>Light weight soap feeling on skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy and not thick like their Pomegranate and rose bodywash, but again it doesn&#x27;t lather well and again it takes a lot to wash yourself with.  </li>
      <li>I never feel a film after leaving the shower and it washes away cleanly.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It was just too slippery while trying to wash, &amp; my skin just didn&#x27;t feel CLEAN.</li>
      <li>Great price, much cheaper than buying individual.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to forget why you don&#x27;t like certain things...</li>
      <li>Thanks so much Softsoap!!!</li>
      <li>I have used this bodywash since they first came out with it</li>
      <li>I have tried so many body washes - sensitive skin specific, no perfumes, tried scrubs, even tried so-called premium washes with body butters in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bamboo is considered a lucky plant in nature so obvious choice when practicing feng shui.</li>
      <li>It really smells feminine and fresh at the same time.  </li>
      <li>When I got home &amp; used it the next day I realized it wasn&#x27;t a gel but the other kind that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
      <li>It lathers really nice and thick</li>
      <li>Just a nice thick, lathered up layer of soapy leg!</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin soft.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Very clean feeling after showers and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with dry skin, but this product dries it out so much to where the tops of my hands start to peel.</li>
      <li>It came very fast which is usual for Amazon.</li>

<li> and this is my new weapon for battling negative chi.</li>
<li> Reason for a 1 rating is that it makes my skin very dry.</li>
<li> Just what I expected.</li>
<li> /&gt;I can&#x27;t want to try some of the other scents.</li>

<li> The ONE problem is you can&#x27;t get all of it out because you can&#x27;t store the bottle upside down.  </li>
<li> Hard to find.  </li>
<li> so a body wash that leaves my skin dry and itchy after I shower is a disappointment to say the least.</li>
<li> floral, subtle, and long-lasting.  </li>
<li> , I had to at least try Softsoaps&#x27;s cherry Blossom and Bamboo Moisturizing wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed!  </li>
<li> I bought this online as I was unable to find it in stores anymore.  </li>

    <li> This soap smells great. Isnt thin or too thick, gives a good lather. Also is good to use as shave cream if you happen to run out.</li>
    <li> Hi everyone.  I have sensitive skin so a body wash that leaves my skin dry and itchy after I shower is a disappointment to say the least. I have tried so many body washes - sensitive skin specific, no perfumes, tried scrubs, even tried so-called premium washes with body butters in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving the scent of Cherry Blossoms, I had to at least try Softsoaps&#x27;s cherry Blossom and Bamboo Moisturizing wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed!  NO dryness, NO itching.  Just soft, wonderful skin. Even on sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t want to try some of the other scents. Thanks so much Softsoap!!!</li>
    <li> I really loved Softsoap&#x27;s pomegranate and mango bodywash even though the fragrance was really citrusy grapefruit, but Softsoap&#x27;s cherry blossom bodywash is not my cup of tea.  It smells more like ROSE bamboo blossom.  It&#x27;s creamy and not thick like their Pomegranate and rose bodywash, but again it doesn&#x27;t lather well and again it takes a lot to wash yourself with.  If you were expecting Bath &amp; Body Works cherry blossom fragrance, think again!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend enjoys this soap a lot!!!  When I saw the price on Amazon and compared it to Target, I almost fell over.  1/2 the price and free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought 6 bottles, and a total of 24 bottles in all of various flavors.  Also bought a water softener so now I not only save 1/2 the cost of this product, I now use 1/2 as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Win Win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft soap is definately my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product!!</li>
    <li> I ordered a package of 6 and I am happy with the purchase. Great price, much cheaper than buying individual. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to forget why you don&#x27;t like certain things...&lt;br /&gt;So at my Freddy&#x27;s all the Softsoap body washes were 2/$4! So, in a hurry  I grabbed this Cherry Blossom (which I hadn&#x27;t tried yet) &amp; the Orange scented one. There&#x27;s a reason why I hadn&#x27;t tried this yet.. When I got home &amp; used it the next day I realized it wasn&#x27;t a gel but the other kind that I don&#x27;t like. But I used it anyway &amp; was reminded why I just don&#x27;t like this type of bodywash.&lt;br /&gt;It was just too slippery while trying to wash, &amp; my skin just didn&#x27;t feel CLEAN. I never have that problem with the gel types; which is why they are my preference.&lt;br /&gt;So, although this one smells really nice I&#x27;ll leave it for my guests &amp; use up the orange one.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash.  I cleans nicely and leaves you smelling wonderfully fresh.  I bought this online as I was unable to find it in stores anymore.  Please Softsoap-bring back this item to our stores!!!  This is my favorite fragrance ever!!!</li>
    <li> A lot of soap for the price I needed a certain kind. Bamboo is considered a lucky plant in nature so obvious choice when practicing feng shui. Very clean feeling after showers and a little goes a long way. Very happy and this is my new weapon for battling negative chi.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SOFT-SOAP, I TRIED SEVERAL BRANDS, BUT THIS IS THE BEST BRAND, THANKS.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Softsoap product!  The combined cherry blossom and wild bamboo scent is wonderful:  floral, subtle, and long-lasting.  It produces lots of suds but doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like some liquid soaps.  It&#x27;s hard to find in my local stores so I&#x27;m delighted to find it available through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I rated this product a 1, not because of the shipper. It came very fast which is usual for Amazon. Reason for a 1 rating is that it makes my skin very dry. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with dry skin, but this product dries it out so much to where the tops of my hands start to peel. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product in the future. 1 Star.</li>
    <li> This softsoap product is wonderful for a shower or a nice long soak. It keeps the bathroom smelling so good. I felt like I had taken a trip to a nice Island.&lt;br /&gt; My very own tropical spa.&lt;br /&gt;It came packed and taped no spillage.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my sister.  But I liked it as well. I kept a bottle also for myself.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this smell.  It really smells feminine and fresh at the same time.  The gel itself is a great consistency, and it&#x27;s really silky.  It&#x27;s not too gel-like and it&#x27;s great.  It lathers really nice and thick, I don&#x27;t even use anything else when I shave my legs!  Just a nice thick, lathered up layer of soapy leg! HA!  ok..anyway..I never feel a film after leaving the shower and it washes away cleanly.  The ONE problem is you can&#x27;t get all of it out because you can&#x27;t store the bottle upside down.  This is a big thing for me, I want every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking on Amazon for a minute, it looks like they have so many more awesome smells, I want to try all of them!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why they stopped selling this scent in stores so I had to order it on Amazon. I&#x27;m disappointed that it smells more soapy and less fragrant than previous bottles I&#x27;ve bought in-store. It needed more cherry scent.</li>
    <li> The product smells good and foams great and comes in a decent size bottle.  As for the price it is in line with what I can get it for at the stores so it is at a fair price but is not a bargain.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. Perfect!</li>
    <li> You squeeze some out onto a wash cloth or buff puff. Light weight soap feeling on skin. Yes you rinse it off.</li>
    <li> I have used this bodywash since they first came out with it and I love it. Could not find it in stores anymore so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and in bulk quantity and great price. This is the best and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> great deal on this supersized shower gel.  I love the smell of the mix of cherry and bamboo. Doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
    <li> Best fragrance in the world.  Keeps my skin soft.  Hard to find.  Look to Amazon for everything they always deliver</li>
