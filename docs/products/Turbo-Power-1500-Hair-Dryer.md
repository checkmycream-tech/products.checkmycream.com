      <li>I LOVE this blow dryer is the best.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how to fix the cord, so I decided that it has given me many years of excellent performance</li>
      <li>I did my research beforehand and saw nothing but good reviews.</li>
      <li>Because of the short-length and fineness of my hair, I also wanted a unit that had a good range of temperatures and speeds.</li>
      <li>Leave the hair better and beautiful.</li>
      <li>This has been by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>So great l love it , drys my hair so good and fast</li>

      <li>My hair is softer and more manageable.</li>

      <li>and she sed that she love the way it works for all this time that she used this item.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER..</li>
      <li>Great price and fast shipping</li>
      <li>more can I say?</li>
      <li>After more than 15 years with this blow dryer, it seems that the cable just burned.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love :)</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>my wife had this itme before for more than 10 years</li>
      <li>But the output width of this nozzle is only around 2&amp;#34;, perfect for a shortie like</li>
      <li>The most powerful blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned!  </li>
      <li>the Turbo 1500 do the magic super easy.</li>
      <li>I bought this one for my mom and its the same quality and works amazing, trust me when I say this is the best investment you could possibly make!!!</li>
      <li>It is also powerful!</li>
      <li>Paradoxically, this unit performs much better than any 1875 W hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used, and yet it is much, much quieter, and range of airflows gives it finesse.</li>
      <li>It comes with 3 different temperature settings and 3 different airflow settings, and I have found the medium temperature and medium airflow to be perfect for my needs.</li>
      <li>A lot of what&#x27;s available on the market now is too hot and too powerful for my hair.</li>
      <li>This gets it done very quickly and no damage to my hair like straight irons do.</li>
      <li>If you use the highest temperature setting, it will get hot!</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair amazing when using it on the last power !</li>
      <li>DRIES MY HAIR FAST AND LEAVES IT SMOOTH</li>
      <li>I had one of them for more than 14 years,but because it was quite old start</li>
      <li>DEFINATELY WORTH EVERY PENNY..</li>
      <li>made my hair super straight feels like right out of the salon !</li>
      <li>I have very short, very, very fine hair.</li>
      <li>super straight and</li>
      <li>I was expecting this blow dryer to be hot really hot</li>
      <li>exact replacement for what my wife has used for years</li>
      <li>LOVE DIFFERENT TEMP SETTINGS AND</li>
      <li>love this dryer,, it is my second one, but wish it lasted longer-</li>
      <li>Ordered a new one right away!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why ,I try both at the same time and the twin turbo is more hot n fast</li>
      <li>It is super fast and it is not heavy.  </li>
      <li>The extremely positive reviews left by other Amazon customers gave me confidence I had made a good</li>
      <li>I am really amazed by this product.</li>
      <li>It is very no-muss, no-fuss, and I don&#x27;t even think mine had packaged instructions with it.</li>
      <li>I no longer have to use a straight iron.</li>
      <li>The motor on this dryer is of much better quality than any I&#x27;ve used previously, causing an increase of air throughput that allows the unit to dry hair very quickly.</li>
      <li>and it doesnt get to hot like the old ones</li>
      <li>Then I decide to look here to see if I find my Turbo dryer and lucky enough I did.  </li>
      <li>I had been impressed with my hair stylist&#x27;s hair dryer, but I knew such an expensive unit was out of my budget.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Some nozzles tend to be exorbitantly wide, which is probably fine if you have a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>Definitely got this one right.</li>
      <li>However, I was willing to spend a little more than $20 on a drugstore hair dryer that, hopefully, would last a bit longer this time.</li>
      <li>It does arrive in a box that looks like it came straight out of the late 80s/early 90s, which I just found to be humorous.</li>
      <li>acting funny.</li>
      <li>So if you need the high temp and high power, it is definitely there for you.</li>
      <li>If you want a professional hair dryer, this is used by stylists here.</li>
      <li>It is a touch heavier than my old dryer, but I like the way it feels in my hand.</li>
      <li>It is well-constructed, and doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34; like my old Con-Air did that caused its paint to flake off everywhere.</li>
      <li>It is well worth every penny spent to purchase it.</li>
      <li>When it was longer, I used to require a diffuser since it is naturally wavy; however, with my current pixie cut, I knew I only really needed a unit that came with a concentrator nozzle.</li>
      <li>she ask me to buy this one because the other one it burns the extension cord actually the plug of the extension and this one have a reset and a power control on the plug so it might be better than the other one</li>
      <li>Wifey had one for 8 years, w/o big issues; until it died.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it, and as a professional stylist she knows a thing</li>
      <li>But it works just as well as my stylist&#x27;s professional dryer and at a terrific price point.</li>
      <li>My old Con-Air finally bit the dust.</li>
      <li>first one was less than 2 yrs</li>

<li> The problem is that it didn&#x27;t come with the concentrator, very disappointing</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My mother gave me this dryer around 15 years ago, and still working   I&#x27;m buying the same one since the electric cord is acting up.   No questions about it is the best one!!</li>
    <li> I had one of them for more than 14 years,but because it was quite old start acting funny. Still work, but sometimes didn&#x27;t want to turn off. So, I bought an expensive one from a retail store and it was junk, I change that blow dryer twice in a year.  Then I decide to look here to see if I find my Turbo dryer and lucky enough I did.  I LOVE this blow dryer is the best. I have long hair and I like my hair super straight and the Turbo 1500 do the magic super easy.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for the wife and she loves it. Definitely got this one right.</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars it has always worked for me and every woman/ girl I have ever know. It what dominican women use in the beauty salon. Trust me my hair is thick and curly, and this definitely straightens it.  Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping thank you</li>
    <li> I was expecting this blow dryer to be hot really hot but it&#x27;s not. I don&#x27;t know maybe is just me&lt;br /&gt;that thinks that way. It gets the job done so I shouldn&#x27;t be complaining.</li>
    <li> My old Con-Air finally bit the dust. I had been impressed with my hair stylist&#x27;s hair dryer, but I knew such an expensive unit was out of my budget. However, I was willing to spend a little more than $20 on a drugstore hair dryer that, hopefully, would last a bit longer this time. I have very short, very, very fine hair. When it was longer, I used to require a diffuser since it is naturally wavy; however, with my current pixie cut, I knew I only really needed a unit that came with a concentrator nozzle. Because of the short-length and fineness of my hair, I also wanted a unit that had a good range of temperatures and speeds. A lot of what&#x27;s available on the market now is too hot and too powerful for my hair. I did a bit of research for hair dryers that matched my criteria and finally settled on this. The extremely positive reviews left by other Amazon customers gave me confidence I had made a good decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happily enough, turns out I was correct! This unit feels solid. It is well-constructed, and doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34; like my old Con-Air did that caused its paint to flake off everywhere. It is a touch heavier than my old dryer, but I like the way it feels in my hand. The bit of added weight does not make the unit any more difficult to use. It is also powerful! The motor on this dryer is of much better quality than any I&#x27;ve used previously, causing an increase of air throughput that allows the unit to dry hair very quickly. Paradoxically, this unit performs much better than any 1875 W hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used, and yet it is much, much quieter, and range of airflows gives it finesse. It comes with 3 different temperature settings and 3 different airflow settings, and I have found the medium temperature and medium airflow to be perfect for my needs. If you use the highest temperature setting, it will get hot! So if you need the high temp and high power, it is definitely there for you. It also comes with a concentrator nozzle, the output width of which in my opinion, is the perfect length. Some nozzles tend to be exorbitantly wide, which is probably fine if you have a lot of hair. But the output width of this nozzle is only around 2&amp;#34;, perfect for a shortie like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say? I am extremely happy with this purchase. It does arrive in a box that looks like it came straight out of the late 80s/early 90s, which I just found to be humorous. It is very no-muss, no-fuss, and I don&#x27;t even think mine had packaged instructions with it. But it works just as well as my stylist&#x27;s professional dryer and at a terrific price point. I would buy again in a heartbeat (but hopefully I won&#x27;t have to, at least for a long, long time).</li>
    <li> I had this blow dryer it was awesome ! It leaves your hair amazing when using it on the last power ! I need to re buy this blow dryer ! I have really thick coarse hair with bangs this blow dryer made my hair super straight feels like right out of the salon !</li>
    <li> exact replacement for what my wife has used for years</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this blower!!! It is well worth every penny spent to purchase it. My hair is softer and more manageable. Great investment!!!!</li>
    <li> My mom had this same hair dryer for about 20 years and was used literally thousands of times, on dozens of different people before it finally died on her, bought this one to replace it and it works just as good!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife-she LOVES it.  Did my research on which hair dryer to get-and the power on this one is incredible.  Still noisy (all hair dryers are), but less so then some of the previous high end ones she has used.</li>
    <li> I have the twin turbo 3200 and I bought this I don&#x27;t know why ,I try both at the same time and the twin turbo is more hot n fast Leave the hair better and beautiful.</li>
    <li> So great l love it , drys my hair so good and fast lm dominican l have curly thick hair . So lm very happy with my turbo</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair dryer.  It is super fast and it is not heavy.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excelent product and quick delivery!! If you want a professional hair dryer, this is used by stylists here. Thank  you from Dominican Republic! Excelente producto y entrega r&amp;aacute;pida! Si desea un secador de pelo profesional, este es el que utilizan las estilistas aqu&amp;iacute;. Gracias desde Rep&amp;uacute;blica Dominicana!</li>
    <li> BEST HAIR DRYER, VERY HAPPY</li>
    <li> I will now be saving money by going less to my hairstylist. This blowdryer dried my hair 2x faster than a previous blowdryer I had.  I wished I had bought this blowdryer years ago!</li>
    <li> Excellent  hair dryer</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER.. DRIES MY HAIR FAST AND LEAVES IT SMOOTH W NO NEED TO IRON IT.. LOVE DIFFERENT TEMP SETTINGS AND DEFINATELY WORTH EVERY PENNY.. MY  STYLIST OWNS THIS SAME ONE AND SAID THEY LAST A VERY VERY LONG TIME. LOVE IT..WOULD DEFINATELY BUY IT AGAIN IF I HAD TO.</li>
    <li> The most powerful blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned!  I&#x27;ve owned one for the past 20 years, and it finally just gave out!  Ordered a new one right away!  Love, love, love :)</li>
    <li> best blow dryer I have ever owned</li>
    <li> Amazing hair dryer! My mom bought me this dryer when I was 12 im 24 now it still works I bought this one for my mom and its the same quality and works amazing, trust me when I say this is the best investment you could possibly make!!!</li>
    <li> Wifey had one for 8 years, w/o big issues; until it died.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it, and as a professional stylist she knows a thing ot two about the topic.&lt;br /&gt;I bought her another one for Christmas, so hopefully manufacture haven&#x27;t change specs dated as previous one.</li>
    <li> my wife had this itme before for more than 10 years and she sed that she love the way it works for all this time that she used this item. she ask me to buy this one because the other one it burns the extension cord actually the plug of the extension and this one have a reset and a power control on the plug so it might be better than the other one and it doesnt get to hot like the old ones</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer last week and got it on the mail today. The problem is that it didn&#x27;t come with the concentrator, very disappointing</li>
    <li> After more than 15 years with this blow dryer, it seems that the cable just burned. The mechanism inside seems to be working (meaning, nothing seems to be burned inside)but I don&#x27;t know how to fix the cord, so I decided that it has given me many years of excellent performance and I need to retire it. I am here to buy the same one again expecting the same quality and value.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever. It reduces my drying time from almost 1 hour 30 minutes to just 45 minutes, eliminating all frizz.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer for any hair style</li>
    <li> love this dryer,, it is my second one, but wish it lasted longer- first one was less than 2 yrs</li>
    <li> This has been by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned. My hair gets frizzy in humidity, is naturally wavy and on the thin side. I no longer have to use a straight iron. It does not make my hair poofy like other dryers do. This gets it done very quickly and no damage to my hair like straight irons do. I am really amazed by this product. I did my research beforehand and saw nothing but good reviews. I cannot recommend enough.</li>
