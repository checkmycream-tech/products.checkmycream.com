      <li>Degree is one of the best that my wife has tried.  </li>

      <li>There is the perfect amount of scent - it&#x27;s there, but not over powering, and it is very effective.  </li>
      <li>It did a great job protecting against odors and it did not stain my clothes.&lt;br</li>

      <li>This deodorant goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>This is a great line for those who don&#x27;t need clinical strength and like a more feminine and summer scented anti-perspirant.</li>
      <li>If that changes, I will be adding it to my monthly S&amp;S to make sure I am literally covered!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be picking up more soon!</li>
      <li>Danced, walked around, worked 10 hour days, and it worked just amazing</li>
      <li>This one glided nice and it did not leave a stain on my shirt which is a thumbs up for</li>
      <li>all, this is an effective product, goes on nice, and provides long-lasting scent and wetness protection.</li>
      <li>Do your own research, and of course avoid anything that gives you concern or causes an irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>It has a nice scent to it</li>
      <li>Now understand that the scent wasn&#x27;t overwhelming even though it could have been (a good</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to be able to try a new scent, and Berry Cool sounded delightful and perfect for summer.</li>
      <li>and I have been happy with it and the berry cool scent.</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m at work I&#x27;m moving around quite a bit, so a good anti-perspirant deodorant is important.</li>
      <li>As far as women&#x27;s deodorants go, this one is perfectly satisfactory.</li>
      <li>and it is by far the best deodorant I have used!</li>
      <li>but it’s very light and will not bother</li>
      <li>It works great at keeping me dry and smells great while doing so.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Likewise, I love the refreshing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love degree product.</li>
      <li>and truthfully I can&#x27;t tell the difference.  </li>
      <li>Degree has made a pretty good deodorant here.</li>
      <li>It states it is a berry scent, however, I can barely smell it, which is a good thing!</li>
      <li>It is certainly cheaper than the Clinical varieties and it lasts longer too, so that is a plus and makes reapplying once a fair trade</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin and this one did a great job with keeping the rashes away.  </li>
      <li>The most important thing I look for in an anti-perspirant is the smell</li>
      <li>In fact many times I can still lightly smell the berry scent when I get up in the morning to take my shower.</li>
      <li>On the positive side, the berry cool scent is quite pleasant.</li>
      <li>This Degree deodorant works well and has a nice light, fresh berry scent.</li>
      <li>It is not a lingering or strong scent, so it won&#x27;t interfere with your body lotions or perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, I simply appreciated the scent, a nice warm berry aroma I found appealing.  </li>
      <li>While I am sure certain occupations or lifestyles will make it impractical to bathe every day, I assume most people do, so one would think 24 hours suffices for most folks.  </li>
      <li>It is fruity but light and really just a nice scent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have only purchased Degree deodorant for women for years now, and I really believe that they have the best product on the market.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Deodorant either works or it doesn&#x27;t, and in this case, the Degree Motion Sense Berry Cool Anti-Perspirant deodorant easily passes the &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; test.</li>
      <li>It has a good scent and you can feel confident that you are protected all day long.</li>
      <li>the whole, pretty good.</li>
      <li>I liked Dove&#x27;s better, but I wouldn&#x27;t dismiss this one entirely.  </li>
      <li>I can apply this right after a shower and when I put my shirt on I do not have any marks on my clothes!</li>
      <li>Non-stinky in the sense of not smelling like sweaty pits, but this berry cool deodorant smells like a fruit smoothie.</li>
      <li>Notes of raspberries and strawberries make this sickly sweet.</li>
      <li>Good antiperspirant, it keeps my dry and stink free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a solid deodorant that has a nice but thankfully not too strong scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now, as to the scent, personally I find this Berry Cool to be exceptionally pleasing.  </li>
      <li>Yes, this does what it claims and would be a great deodorant for active women.</li>
      <li>Just a mild preference.</li>
      <li>I are not a stranger to the the Degree Motion Sense line of anti-perspirants for women and normally use Sexy Intrigue.</li>
      <li>I am an active person and thought this would be a good fit for me to use when I am exercising at home or out biking or hiking.</li>
      <li>I am always trying new antiperspirants to see if something will work better.</li>
      <li>First off, the Degree Motion Sense Anti-Perspirant Deodorant smells yummy!  </li>
      <li>This has a pleasant scent not over powering and will not clash with other perfumes you are using.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Degree goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t sting straight out of the shower, after shaving.</li>
      <li>I thought that this would be ok for me because it is only lightly perfumed</li>
      <li>It is worth a look.</li>
      <li>At the end of a regular work day, I went out for a 2 mile power walk in pleasantly warm weather</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells really nice, not to whorey or upper class society ...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It dries on the underarm pretty quickly</li>
      <li>34;the more you move, the more it protects.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve used both my regular product and the Degree on busy days at work</li>
      <li>Also, I did not feel like I smelled any better or was kept dry any better than normal.</li>
      <li>The only issue I have with this particular one is the Berry Cool scent is more appropriate for a teenager than an adult.</li>
      <li>This was a first time for me to use Degree.  </li>
      <li>Hubby and I love all Degree products and this one is just the same.</li>
      <li>So, if you do not need something strong or if you are not very active (I am not and it still didn&#x27;t work for me), then this might work for you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Degree in the past and liked it, but it[&#x27;s never been this kind that has such a neat fruity fragrance.</li>
      <li>She likes the new berry scent and it is just as good as the other kinds she has tried.  </li>
      <li>Foremost, I have super sensitive skin ...</li>
      <li>deodorant is a solid and goes on quite easily.  </li>
      <li>The fruity scent is a nice break from the typical flowery and baby powder stuff.</li>
      <li>(especially when it comes to scents), so she&#x27;s been using the Degree Motion Sense Berry Cool antiperspirant for a little over a month now and has had nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
      <li>She loves this enough to make this her new favorite go-to deodorant.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and didn&#x27;t leave any white traces anywhere.  </li>
      <li>I really like it as well.</li>
      <li>I really wish this was on subscribe and save because I would like to have one once a month.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>This anti-Perspirant deodorant works very well.  </li>
      <li>I live in Florida, its hot.</li>
      <li>You cannot feel them, but they are there, so as you become more active, move about, etc.</li>
      <li>I used this deodorant specifically for my more active days.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While most “48 hour” antiperspirants use aluminum-based active ingredients, Degree Motion Sense uses Cyclopentasiloxane.  </li>
      <li>The only area of improvement I could see with them is to leave less residue if you&#x27;re wearing a nice black dress or something, but for everyday use this product is perfect.</li>
      <li>Mind you, I don&#x27;t sweat much nor do I seem to need anything stronger than a normal anti-perspirant.</li>
      <li>deodorant provides full protection, even under stress and physical exertion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this goes on dry cool  and clear and has a fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Unlike the gel or creme-based products that I often buy, this stick can last me about twice as long (which tells me that it is pretty easy to overuse those gel</li>
      <li>feel silly writing about how great this is</li>
      <li>Otherwise, under normal circumstances, it was efficient.</li>
      <li>In this case of this deodorant, I have no negative reactions to it, whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>right in the middle</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty simple when it comes to deodorant expectations.  </li>
      <li>Some of us dandy little princesses need a strong antiperspirant, I am one of those.</li>
      <li>I have used a lot of different brands and if I really want non stinky armpits even during strenuous exercise or times of high stress I use Degree.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am not sure why all the claims in the antiperspirant industry on 48 hour protection.  While I am sure certain occupations or lifestyles will make it impractical to bathe every day, I assume most people do, so one would think 24 hours suffices for most folks.  That said, I do not think I have found any products which really have much effectiveness beyond a long work day (10-14 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think Degree has an idea here which does help extend this protection.  Their Motion-Sense product has micro-beads in it.  The beads contain the product.  You cannot feel them, but they are there, so as you become more active, move about, etc. they break and release additional product, which, in turn, extends your antiperspirant protection and renews the deodorant scent.  48 hours is still something I don’t buy, unless you are not moving your arms or performing any activity at all, and remain in a controlled temperature all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as to the scent, personally I find this Berry Cool to be exceptionally pleasing.  It is fruity but light and really just a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;While most “48 hour” antiperspirants use aluminum-based active ingredients, Degree Motion Sense uses Cyclopentasiloxane.  It is a silicone and is used in beauty products.  It is not considered unsafe for humans, although some studies voice concerns about it, particularly because a small amount of it, once absorbed through the skin, reaches the circulatory system.  Do your own research, and of course avoid anything that gives you concern or causes an irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, this is an effective product, goes on nice, and provides long-lasting scent and wetness protection.</li>
    <li> Good antiperspirant, it keeps my dry and stink free. I work out a lot and don&#x27;t want to smell bad in public. I&#x27;m just not impressed by this scent, not my favorite.</li>
    <li> First off, the Degree Motion Sense Anti-Perspirant Deodorant smells yummy!  It goes on smoothly and didn&#x27;t leave any white traces anywhere.  I have to use deodorant in various areas of my body to keep things fresh and dry (TMI?  Not if you know what I&#x27;m talking about!)  Good deodorant is a must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It boasts a 48-hour lifespan, something I didn&#x27;t get out of it.  It needed reapplying sooner than that.  Now understand that the scent wasn&#x27;t overwhelming even though it could have been (a good thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this one did a great job with keeping the rashes away.  That&#x27;s a big plus in my book.  I have used other deodorant, clinical and non-clinical, and feel this one did a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; job.  I liked Dove&#x27;s better, but I wouldn&#x27;t dismiss this one entirely.  It is worth a look.</li>
    <li> I am an active person and thought this would be a good fit for me to use when I am exercising at home or out biking or hiking. This was a first time for me to use Degree.  The berry scent was a little off-putting for me.  It has almost a body odor scent in my opinion.  Also, I did not feel like I smelled any better or was kept dry any better than normal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty simple when it comes to deodorant expectations.  I want something that keeps me fresh and dry.  This motion sense stuff seemed a bit sci-fi, but hey, would it work?  I used this deodorant specifically for my more active days.  First, I simply appreciated the scent, a nice warm berry aroma I found appealing.  As I went about my day, I continued feeling reasonably fresh and dry.  Yes, this does what it claims and would be a great deodorant for active women.</li>
    <li> I like Degree deodorant. I have used a lot of different brands and if I really want non stinky armpits even during strenuous exercise or times of high stress I use Degree. The only issue I have with this particular one is the Berry Cool scent is more appropriate for a teenager than an adult. Smells like candy, and I don&#x27;t keep candy in my underarms.</li>
    <li> I thought that this would be ok for me because it is only lightly perfumed but I am allergic to it.  Had to go back to secret unscented.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Degree in the past and liked it, but it[&#x27;s never been this kind that has such a neat fruity fragrance. I love the smell. Finally something different than the powdery fragrances. Not only do I like this version, but my teen daughter does too. She loves this enough to make this her new favorite go-to deodorant.  I can see we will probably be buying this for her from now on. I really like it as well. It works great at keeping me dry and smells great while doing so.</li>
    <li> This anti-Perspirant deodorant works very well.  Degree is one of the best that my wife has tried.  She likes the new berry scent and it is just as good as the other kinds she has tried.  It s worth the extra little bit of money that it costs as it provides extra protection that other brands don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Foremost, I have super sensitive skin ... I seem to be sensitive or allergic to about 1/3 the health and beauty products I purchase. In this case of this deodorant, I have no negative reactions to it, whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, I love the refreshing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant provides full protection, even under stress and physical exertion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this stick lasts forever! Unlike the gel or creme-based products that I often buy, this stick can last me about twice as long (which tells me that it is pretty easy to overuse those gel products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have only purchased Degree deodorant for women for years now, and I really believe that they have the best product on the market.  There is the perfect amount of scent - it&#x27;s there, but not over powering, and it is very effective.  The only area of improvement I could see with them is to leave less residue if you&#x27;re wearing a nice black dress or something, but for everyday use this product is perfect.</li>
    <li> The most important thing I look for in an anti-perspirant is the smell and I sweat alot and this smell was great! I have very sensitive skin so I use both men and female deodorants because some give me a terrible rash. This one glided nice and it did not leave a stain on my shirt which is a thumbs up for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Degree has another winner!</li>
    <li> My wife generally uses Clinical Strength deodorants, but she&#x27;s not averse to trying something new (especially when it comes to scents), so she&#x27;s been using the Degree Motion Sense Berry Cool antiperspirant for a little over a month now and has had nothing but good things to say about it. She likes the berry scent, which she describes as &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and said that it feels like it &amp;#34;works harder&amp;#34; when she&#x27;s more active (in her terminology, that means when she sweats, and her level of activity is considerable thanks to having 3 little girls under 4 years-old at home). It doesn&#x27;t leave any noticeable residue on her clothes and all-in-all, she&#x27;s been happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deodorant either works or it doesn&#x27;t, and in this case, the Degree Motion Sense Berry Cool Anti-Perspirant deodorant easily passes the &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; test.</li>
    <li> The degree motion sense works. I love degree, it keeps my pits dry and non-stinky down here in the swamp. Non-stinky in the sense of not smelling like sweaty pits, but this berry cool deodorant smells like a fruit smoothie. Notes of raspberries and strawberries make this sickly sweet. It says berry, it means berry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Degree goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t sting straight out of the shower, after shaving. It keeps me dry and non stinky all day and all night long (down here we sweat at night too, woo hoo!)</li>
    <li> This Degree deodorant works well and has a nice light, fresh berry scent. It is not a lingering or strong scent, so it won&#x27;t interfere with your body lotions or perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It performs well with odor control. If I was really active outside in the heat, I did find I needed to apply again to avoid any wetness. I hate any amount of wetness or dampness, so that is just a personal preference. Otherwise, under normal circumstances, it was efficient. I am partial to Clinical Strength deodorants, just because they do not allow for any wetness at all, but as long as this is reapplied during the day an extra time, I have no problem with it. It is certainly cheaper than the Clinical varieties and it lasts longer too, so that is a plus and makes reapplying once a fair trade off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries on the underarm pretty quickly and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with irritation, discoloration on white clothing and no white marks on dark clothing.</li>
    <li> As far as women&#x27;s deodorants go, this one is perfectly satisfactory. It&#x27;s a solid deodorant that has a nice but thankfully not too strong scent. I&#x27;m not sure how much I buy into the &amp;#34;motion activated freshness&amp;#34; element that is advertised, but it&#x27;s definitely long lasting.</li>
    <li> This deodorant goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes and has a pleasant smell.  At the end of a regular work day, I went out for a 2 mile power walk in pleasantly warm weather and I didn&#x27;t smell -- so I&#x27;d say it does the job.</li>
    <li> I are not a stranger to the the Degree Motion Sense line of anti-perspirants for women and normally use Sexy Intrigue. I was thrilled to be able to try a new scent, and Berry Cool sounded delightful and perfect for summer. The anti-perspirant is a white solid, but I don&#x27;t seem to have problems with it marking clothing. The scent is a sweet berry with a perfume quality and it seems to last all day long. In fact many times I can still lightly smell the berry scent when I get up in the morning to take my shower. I have not really noticed the difference between the motion sense vs other types of Degree, but I do know that it keeps me dry and I don&#x27;t find wet spots, even on the humid and quite hot summer-like days we&#x27;ve been having lately. Mind you, I don&#x27;t sweat much nor do I seem to need anything stronger than a normal anti-perspirant. This is a great line for those who don&#x27;t need clinical strength and like a more feminine and summer scented anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> When I&#x27;m at work I&#x27;m moving around quite a bit, so a good anti-perspirant deodorant is important. Degree Motion Sense claims that &amp;#34;the more you move, the more it protects.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve used both my regular product and the Degree on busy days at work and truthfully I can&#x27;t tell the difference.  That being said, it does protect well and I have been happy with it and the berry cool scent.</li>
    <li> Not only does this deodorant not do its job, but it also has an overpowering fragrance that gave me a slightly sore nose and throat from breathing it. It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell, it&#x27;s just way too strong. The scent does not dissipate quickly like some deodorants, so beware if you are the slightest bit sensitive to artificial fragrances.</li>
    <li> I tried this antiperspirant for 2 days, thankfully over a weekend when I wasn&#x27;t at work.  Although this product claims to protect against odor and wetness for 48 hours, I was sweaty and smelly within an hour.  I typically use a clinical strength deodorant, but I had high hopes for this because of the 48 hour claim.  On the positive side, the berry cool scent is quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> Degree products have always worked well for me. Degree Motion Sense Antiperspirant Deodorant is no different. It keeps me dry. It goes on evenly and doesn’t leave residue. The only thing I don’t like is the scent. I just happen to prefer floral scents to fruit or food scents. If you’re a fan of berry scented hygiene products, this could be a great option for you.</li>
    <li> I love degree product. this goes on dry cool  and clear and has a fresh scent. Will keep you dry in the hottest weather without staining your clothing. This has a pleasant scent not over powering and will not clash with other perfumes you are using.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida, its hot. I am also very active with hiking, walking, dancing, and sitting on bar-stools. Degree has promised in this product to have some sort of sentient deodorant that knows when I am in motion...and activate stank repelling freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really nice, not to whorey or upper class society ...right in the middle how I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for a week. Danced, walked around, worked 10 hour days, and it worked just amazing I did not have to reapply at all.</li>
    <li> I wore this on a week when I had three interviews and the temperature was close to 100 degrees.  So I gave it a good workout.  And it passed with flying colors.  It did a great job protecting against odors and it did not stain my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant is a solid and goes on quite easily.  It has a nice scent to it but it’s very light and will not bother you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to a lot of stuff but this deodorant did not bother my skin in the slightest.  It just worked.  During a very hard and hot week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Degree is a brand that is hit or miss for me. When I opened this and saw the deodorant was a solid white, I chuckled. Others deodorants I have used that are solid white have always stuck to my clothing even when they stated they were ‘invisible’ or ‘clear’.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for weeks and it is by far the best deodorant I have used! It states it is a berry scent, however, I can barely smell it, which is a good thing! A lot of scented deodorants start to wear off or even stink after a few hours. This one, even in mid 90 degree temperatures, does not smell! It has kept me dry on the hottest days we have had here in North Carolina. I switched one day to another and immediately was sweating! I can apply this right after a shower and when I put my shirt on I do not have any marks on my clothes! Also, after a few hours some deodorant turns into clumps under your arms, not this one! It stays in place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel silly writing about how great this is but I have not found a deodorant that works this well! I really wish this was on subscribe and save because I would like to have one once a month. As I write this review it is only an add on item. If that changes, I will be adding it to my monthly S&amp;S to make sure I am literally covered!</li>
    <li> Degree has made a pretty good deodorant here. The fruity scent is a nice break from the typical flowery and baby powder stuff. It seems to do the job reasonably well, though we&#x27;ve had a few days that were hot and humid enough that you&#x27;d have to bathe in antiperspirant to avoid being soaked with sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, pretty good. I tend to like the way Dove&#x27;s products feel against my skin by just a little bit, but it&#x27;s definitely not a situation where I&#x27;d never be willing to use Degree instead. Just a mild preference.</li>
    <li> Hubby and I love all Degree products and this one is just the same. It has a good scent and you can feel confident that you are protected all day long. I&#x27;ll be picking up more soon!</li>
    <li> Some of us dandy little princesses need a strong antiperspirant, I am one of those. I am always trying new antiperspirants to see if something will work better. This one was not a good alternative. The antiperspirant is not very strong and half way through the day I applied a second antiperspirant (the emergency one I keep in my office). So, if you do not need something strong or if you are not very active (I am not and it still didn&#x27;t work for me), then this might work for you. It did not for me.</li>
