      <li>Ok</li>
      <li>Be sure to subscribe and save</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no wonder that the two most pesky women...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s become easy to purchase and easier on my wallet as the gift shop prices are a bit more pricey.  </li>
      <li>Love the fragrance free.</li>
      <li>I ordered the product and was sent a bottle that leaked out, looked used and was not fragrance free.</li>
      <li>I wanted the fragrance free to take to and use at work.</li>
      <li>Feels smooth but not greasy.</li>
      <li>The e-mail I received had a customer service number and the name of the representative and within five days I received the a bottle of lotion that I originally ordered free of charge.</li>
      <li>I ordered the fragrance free and was sent original scent, which lists fragrance in the list of ingredients.</li>
      <li>I put top of the line good quality lotion/cream/ointment on my body from head to toe every single day.</li>
      <li>So, as I very rarely take the time to write recommendations, I had to in this case simply because I wanted to tell people just how good this product truly is.</li>
      <li>This lotion allows me to keep my skin in great shape with less applications.</li>
      <li>Works great, I have very dry skin, and this seems to be the only product that really works, I just love it!</li>
      <li>The hospital staff said it was their best kept secret.  </li>
      <li>Work outside with my hands this lotion amazingly keeps them soft and free from cracking.</li>
      <li>Unlike any other lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried, 24-Hour Skin Therapy is thick, moisture rich, non-greasy, applies easily and in the case of their Free and Clear scent, free of any distracting flowery fragrance which is great for a working man like me.  </li>
      <li>As far as the lotion it is fine just contains parabens.</li>
      <li>It is super hydrating and leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>Two months later the Lotion Company (Amazon fulfilled my order) saw the review, sent me a e-mail and asked me if they could send me the bottle of lotion FREE OF CHARGE</li>
      <li>even then it really isn&#x27;t that moisturizing.</li>
      <li>This lotion really elimates that problem.</li>
      <li>thanks  </li>
      <li>Thank god, and thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is any better than any other unscented &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; lotion, but I like it well enough.  </li>
      <li>It serves the purpose and it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
      <li>Skin is really smooth, and it last a long time.</li>
      <li>Certainly doesn&#x27;t last 24 hours, doubt it lasts 2 and</li>
      <li>I use it on my children who have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I then left a very unfavorable review.</li>
      <li>After just a few short days of use, 24-Hour Skin Therapy had my hands healed, supple and back into healthy condition.  </li>
      <li>Being a guy I wouldn&#x27;t normally buy such a product.</li>
      <li>Really helped my mother&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
      <li>I bought it to use with essential oils and so far have just made a lavender hand lotion.  </li>
      <li>I get dyshidrotic eczema on my hands and feet in the summer that results in dry peeling skin, and this cream has so far prevented the peeling.</li>
      <li>If you live in the Midwest your skin is dry more often than not, as a man, I&#x27;m usually too lazy to put lotion on</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this lotion for active athlete.</li>

    <li> Fantastic lotion! Feels smooth but not greasy. Love the fragrance free. I often shower twice a day and fight dry skin. This lotion really elimates that problem. I would highly recommend this lotion for active athlete. Be sure to subscribe and save so you never run out.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful! It is super hydrating and leaves skin feeling soft. Not sticky. Not too thick. Just perfect! I use it on my children who have sensitive skin. And I even use it on my face. One stop shop! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Loved the lotion! Awesome product! You wont be disappointed! Skin is really smooth, and it last a long time. I sew and while making costumes, keeps my skin dry. A+ product!</li>
    <li> While visiting my daughter who attends college in West Lafayette, Indiana, my wife tried this lotion which my daughter had purchased at a nearby gift shop.  She loved it....as does my daughter.  So at some point, after running out of my normal drug store lotion, I tried my wife&#x27;s secret stash of this stuff.  Now I too have become hooked. If you live in the Midwest your skin is dry more often than not, as a man, I&#x27;m usually too lazy to put lotion on but occasionally I must. This stuff last for several days.....it&#x27;s amazing.  It&#x27;s no wonder that the two most pesky women...I mean wonderful, beautiful women in my life (wife and daughter) are hooked on this lotion.  Every time we travelled to Indiana, my wife had to stop and stock up.  Thank god, and thanks to Amazon, that is no longer the case.  It&#x27;s become easy to purchase and easier on my wallet as the gift shop prices are a bit more pricey.  So, as I very rarely take the time to write recommendations, I had to in this case simply because I wanted to tell people just how good this product truly is.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer.  This does have a slight scent to it but is still unscented.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product and was sent a bottle that leaked out, looked used and was not fragrance free. Amazon overnighted another bottle that arrived in a condition worse than the first one and then Amazon refunded my money. I then left a very unfavorable review. Two months later the Lotion Company (Amazon fulfilled my order) saw the review, sent me a e-mail and asked me if they could send me the bottle of lotion FREE OF CHARGE and they apologized. To say that I was impressed is an understatement. Third party vendors on Amazon may not live up to Amazon standards. The e-mail I received had a customer service number and the name of the representative and within five days I received the a bottle of lotion that I originally ordered free of charge. The lotion is comparable to Oil of Olay, Lubriderm, Eucerin and does indeed provide 24 hours of moisture for the skin. Dry, parched, irritated skin is unattractive. I have eczema on the bottom of both of my legs and I go to great length to keep it managed and under control. I put top of the line good quality lotion/cream/ointment on my body from head to toe every single day. I am always on the look out for quality moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I ordered the fragrance free and was sent original scent, which lists fragrance in the list of ingredients. I wanted the fragrance free to take to and use at work. Tried to overlook the mistake by just using it at home and never purchasing this again... But it just isn&#x27;t very good. Certainly doesn&#x27;t last 24 hours, doubt it lasts 2 and even then it really isn&#x27;t that moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Works great, I have very dry skin, and this seems to be the only product that really works, I just love it!</li>
    <li> My skin is always so dry and I always find myself applying lotion several times a day. This lotion allows me to keep my skin in great shape with less applications. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a really thick and creamy moisturizer. Feels decadent. I use it all over, but the greatest impact has been on my hands and feet. I get dyshidrotic eczema on my hands and feet in the summer that results in dry peeling skin, and this cream has so far prevented the peeling. I started ordering this through subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for years. Work outside with my hands this lotion amazingly keeps them soft and free from cracking. I also love their lip balm it is the best I&#x27;ve found. I don&#x27;t see it here but you can probably contact them..thanks  The Lotion Company.......  Bella Luna Hay Farm.  Inola  Ok</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is any better than any other unscented &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; lotion, but I like it well enough.  I bought it to use with essential oils and so far have just made a lavender hand lotion.  It absorbs well and not too greasy.</li>
    <li> this is the best lotion I have ever used for my skin.  it feels great at application and rubs in easily with no oily feel.  It&#x27;s moisturinzing truly does last 24 hours as I use it daily after a morning shower and occasionally if I am out in the sun will re-apply.  dont miss out on this product - once you try it you will be hooked!</li>
    <li> Really helped my mother&#x27;s dry skin. She was having such an issue. It serves the purpose and it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
    <li> I know that this is my bad that I did not read the ingredients more closely but this product has two different parabens. If I had realized this I would have never bought this product. As far as the lotion it is fine just contains parabens.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion the most.  No greasy after feel.  Arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law discovered this lotion in our local hospital gift shop.  The hospital staff said it was their best kept secret.  All the doctors and nurses use it and recommend it to their patients.  I began using this lotion in mid-winter last year when my hands were severely dry, chaffed and cracked due to the harsh cold dry climate.  After just a few short days of use, 24-Hour Skin Therapy had my hands healed, supple and back into healthy condition.  Unlike any other lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried, 24-Hour Skin Therapy is thick, moisture rich, non-greasy, applies easily and in the case of their Free and Clear scent, free of any distracting flowery fragrance which is great for a working man like me.  Best lotion ever and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  My husband has psoriasis and it is the only lotion that truly lasts and provides relief. We both use it and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Being a guy I wouldn&#x27;t normally buy such a product. But, I live in a very cold climate and the air is extremely dry...so I needed some skin therapy. This stuff is the BEST! No smell and absorbs rapidly! My lady that like it better than I do!</li>
