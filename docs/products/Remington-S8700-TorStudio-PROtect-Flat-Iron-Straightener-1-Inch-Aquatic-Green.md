      <li>So far, it&#x27;s been working great</li>
      <li>I never thought I would ever have straight hair in the summer, but with his iron, I do and it looks good.</li>

      <li>She also said it works to straighten and smooth hair very quickly.</li>
      <li>So, my criticisms are minor and as of right now I&#x27;m really happy with this iron!</li>
      <li>Her hair looked spectacular and was straight and smooth..</li>
      <li>Nice controls and heats fast as well.</li>
      <li>This is a great iron that I would actually give 4.5 stars instead of 5 if I had that choice.</li>
      <li>vote, because why disagree with a happy wife, is this is a great product and likely will work for women with various types of hair.</li>
      <li>( I did not receive mine free).</li>
      <li>I only used the iron with the macadamia oil, it is a great combination and saves me having to stop and spray.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great flat iron.  </li>
      <li>The straightener heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>It’s quick and easy.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice flat iron.  </li>
      <li>unique feature is the vapor infusion.</li>
      <li>I have not used it with oil yet but use the water option, I do see it says you must use filter water or otherwise the wick will clog, I am a bit unsure why oil doesn&#x27;t clog the wick or if you have to clean or replace it ever</li>
      <li>As a person with naturally curly hair, this is an amazing result.</li>
      <li>I love it so much I gave my Chi away.  </li>
      <li>The steam feature is cool.</li>
      <li>It does seem to be cool vapor.  </li>

      <li>Good solid Remington straightener -- no complaints, and works as advertised.</li>
      <li>Well made and straightens the hair quickly.</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and automatically cuts off after an hour.  </li>
      <li>It combines 1&amp;#34; Ultra Ceramic plates with the revolutionary Vapor Infusion Technology to provide 90% more frizz control and 68% more protection from breakage compared to standard Remington straighteners without Protect technology.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for all hair types, but be sure to moisturize your hair</li>
      <li>If anyone has hair like my daughters and is interested, I can pass on the tips our hairdresser gave us that greatly reduced her dry, frizzy, course hair, and breakages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Might be good too for anyone getting some grey hair (like me).</li>
      <li>I have fine, brittle hair that loves to do what it wants to do no matter what I try.</li>
      <li>It works wells to straighten curly hair as well as to smooth already straight but frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Overall, our family liked this iron.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>The macadamia treatment really is nice and they do sell products similar to it at beauty supply stores for when the product runs out.</li>
      <li>This flat iron does a good job, but I have to admit that I am not a fan of the vapor dispenser, which is really the selling point of this unit.</li>
      <li>This is a nice flat iron.</li>
      <li>The directions were very clear and easy to understand.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that this Remington flat iron is hands down the best flat iron I have ever owned!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I own several flat irons and was very excited to give this one a try. I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with Remington&#x27;s products. This flat iron does a good job, but I have to admit that I am not a fan of the vapor dispenser, which is really the selling point of this unit. The flat iron itself is only about an inch wide, but with the dispenser it is double that size, making it a bit clunky. The vapor dispenser is a hassle and I see no benefit at all. Additionally, it comes with the macadamia oil for the dispenser, but states clearly that you can&#x27;t just put any oil in there. So where do I find more macadamia? Just another hassle I&#x27;m not ready to deal with.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend was excited to give this a try, given that her current hair straightener was also a Remington, but was like a $20 Remington.  The expectation was that this one would be a lot better.  In reality, its hard to say that its any better.  Yeah, it heats up a bit quicker and has an auto-turn off feature, but functionally it&#x27;s the same, only heavier and harder for someone with small hands to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the main thing you&#x27;re paying for with this model is the infusion technology.  We didn&#x27;t even try it out because it just isn&#x27;t of interest.  If you are interested in that feature, definitely buy this model.  Otherwise, a cheaper Remington will do the job just as well!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to order. REMINGTON S8700 T/STUDIO PROTECT FLAT IRON, 1-INCH, AQUATIC GREEN. I have three teen daughters, and one that has thick, course, dry, frizzy hair. We are always on the lookout for products that will help reduced what she hates so much about her hair. I was more than a little intrigued by the concept of not using high heat and adding water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, my youngest - who has pretty healthy hair - and I – with course, thin, frizzy hair – tired it. We both felt it did a great job reducing frizz, flyaway’s, leaving it smooth, silky, and shinny. Knowing that it is less damaging on your hair is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next to use it, my daughter with long, thick, course, dry, frizzy hair. And the results…WOW! It looks great! Really loving this straighter! It’s quick and easy. Well worth the money. If anyone has hair like my daughters and is interested, I can pass on the tips our hairdresser gave us that greatly reduced her dry, frizzy, course hair, and breakages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Vapor Infusion Technology&lt;br /&gt;• 1&amp;#34; Ultra Ceramic Plates&lt;br /&gt;• Macadamia Conditioning Treatment&lt;br /&gt;• Salon High Heat&lt;br /&gt;• Digital Controls with Temperature Lock&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discover Remington&#x27;s latest hair care breakthrough-the T|Studio Protect Flat Iron. It combines 1&amp;#34; Ultra Ceramic plates with the revolutionary Vapor Infusion Technology to provide 90% more frizz control and 68% more protection from breakage compared to standard Remington straighteners without Protect technology. The Protect uses water and an included macadamia conditioning treatment to supply cool micro vapor that absorbs into hair, protecting it from damage while you style. Plus, the 450 Degree heat gives you salon-quality results that last. Experience the Remington T|Studio Protect Flat Iron and leave your hair cares behind.</li>
    <li> I had a tough time curling my hair with this flat iron. Also my hair is pretty long so I felt the heating time was too long. I used it on my mom who has short hair and it worked well on her.</li>
    <li> I currently have a Remington straightener, but decided to try this because of the &amp;#34;frizz reduction&amp;#34; and the wider plate.  So far, it&#x27;s been working great and I do see a difference in the frizz along the sides, especially since it&#x27;s summer and usually my naturally wavy hair looks disastrous.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Overall, our family liked this iron. It&#x27;s actually wide for a 1 inch iron. In some ways I would prefer something thinner. However, the wide top does help your hair lay flat as it passes through the iron, making it easy to handle. I found the little reservoir part hard to open and it only uses distilled water or their solutions. I think this will be hard to clean and might be the first thing to stop working (similar to irons when you use tap water). I know it&#x27;s not designed for tap water, but not everyone has a distilled water in their bathrooms. I like the idea of steaming the hair straight. It just seems like that must be gentler on your hair. Less damage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a high quality flat iron. Well made and straightens the hair quickly. Might be good too for anyone getting some grey hair (like me). I never used flat irons but the texture of the grey hair is different from our natural colored hair, so I find this helps smooth out those frizzies. Gives me a &amp;#34;just came from the salon&amp;#34; look. I do recommend this, just don&#x27;t have high expectations on the reservoir feature to last for years to come. ~ And if that does fail, they you just have a nice quality flat iron, so it shouldn&#x27;t be a decision breaker.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this Remington flat iron is hands down the best flat iron I have ever owned! Previously, I have hesitated to buy the higher price ranged flat iron, sticking to the twenty dollar models, because I was of the idea that they are all the same. I was...so...so...so... wrong. This flat iron sells for about seventy five dollars and it is worth every penny. And compared to other high end models, this one is on the lower side of prices.  So whats so great? Well... it heats up super fast, in about 20 seconds or so it was ready to go. It has a resevoir where you can add water, heat protectant or both. This is &amp;#34;vaporized&amp;#34; onto your hair as your flat iron, which makes hair incredibly smooth and soft.  My hair took less time that it ever has to straighten and it looked 100 times better! I was asked if I had a proffesional blow out! As a person with naturally curly hair, this is an amazing result. I love, love, love this iron and can&#x27;t imagine straightening my hair with anything else!</li>
    <li> Usually you will spray your hair with product, to protect and soften it, every few minutes as your work your way through your hair. I only used the iron with the macadamia oil, it is a great combination and saves me having to stop and spray. While the oil doesn&#x27;t add weight to the iron, the space needed for the oil made the iron clunkier than previous irons and the iron is warmer to the touch when using. Heats up super fast.  I will bring it to my salon next time and see what my stylist thinks.</li>
    <li> This straightening iron features several of Remington&#x27;s signature, terrific features:  a long cord, auto shut-off, several heat settings, and smooth plates that meet evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vapor feature and its housing throws off the entire styling experience.  The vapor reservoir occupies about 1/2 inch adjacent to the plates.  That means if you want to maintain symmetry, you must consistently hold with with-chamber or without-chamber upwards or downwards.  With an ordinary straightening iron, it doesn&#x27;t matter, because the distance from the edge of the iron is the same on either side of the plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the vapor feature, and it works, but is not desirable.  One must hold the chamber side away from the scalp, which means the hair near the scalp will not be as flat as the lengths.  The vapor does make the hair straighter and flatter, no doubt about that, but from root to tip, the hair will not be evenly straight and flat.  It&#x27;s impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vapor chamber has a wick, and it absorbs water, which is released as vapor when the vapor button is depressed.  I saw a couple puffs, but no steam.  It does seem to be cool vapor.  But the wick takes quite a while to soak up water.  So much for the 30-second heating time.  A good five minutes and the wick was still not saturated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I really don&#x27;t like this iron.  I give it three stars because of the aforementioned features that Remington does consistently well.</li>
    <li> This is a nice flat iron. Easy to hold and maneuver.  The steam feature is cool. This can help hold your style or, ease the taming of frizzy hair. I like the fact you can put oil into the water which will help keep your hair healthy.</li>
    <li> I really love the Remington S8700 T|Studio PROtect Flat Iron Straightener. With the added Macadamia Conditioning Treatment it is a snap to  get beautiful looking hair. I have fine, brittle hair that loves to do what it wants to do no matter what I try. My hair seems to behave better when I straighten it with this flat iron. Looks like the Vapor feature does make a big difference in my hair styling and makes it worth the price. You can get cheaper flat irons but, so they really do what you want them to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to heat up and is ready for use faster than other flat irons I&#x27;ve used. Easy and effective. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> For the most part, I really like this flat iron.  It has a reservoir for conditioner or distilled water that helps ease frizz, has several heat settings, and clips shut for easier storage.  It heats up quickly and automatically cuts off after an hour.  The plates that heat are smaller than the exterior so it&#x27;s almost impossible to get the flat iron close to your scalp, leaving a small part of your hair un-ironed.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron that I would actually give 4.5 stars instead of 5 if I had that choice. As a reference my hair is pretty average, not coarse or fine, wavy, frizzy if I don&#x27;t use product, long, and about 50% gray, but colored. I have owned several different kinds of flat irons over the years, and my Remington irons have always lasted until I decide to retire them to &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; status because they are several years old. I&#x27;ve had more expensive brands fail around 12 months, so even though I&#x27;ve only used this iron for about a month I already love the reliability of the Remington brand. To start, I have to admit I was actually feeling cynical about the Vapor Infusion Technology because in my experience this is exactly the kind of new technology that doesn&#x27;t work as advertised or stops working pretty quickly. I decided to load the reservoir with the included macadamia conditioning treatment and give the vapor a try, a little worried that it would make my hair look greasy. The result was fantastic! Not at all greasy, all my flyaways were gone, and I didn&#x27;t have to use the anti-frizz post-styling treatment I usually use. I wash my hair every three days and I worried that by day 3 my hair would look greasy because of the oil in the vapor, but it didn&#x27;t. The Vapor Infusion Technology has its own on/off button, so I did not use it on day 2 or 3 for my touch-up styling. If the Vapor Infusion Technology fails before the iron gets old I&#x27;ll update this review, but for now I&#x27;m loving this option. I haven&#x27;t tried using distilled water instead of the provided oil since the oil works so well and allows me to skip my other styling product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasons I would take away half a star if I could are for a few small reasons - first, it looks like the Macadamia oil for the Vapor chamber can only be ordered off the Remington site right now, which makes it inconvenient to replace and the instructions don&#x27;t include any information about what types of conditioning treatments to shop for. Second, I prefer 2&amp;#34; plates for my long hair and I have had to slow down a bit using this 1&amp;#34; iron, so adding the vapor technology to a 2&amp;#34; iron would be welcomed, and last, I&#x27;m used to seeing a temperature number on my other Remington irons but this iron just starts with 2 dots, adding one dot for each increase you push. The instructions tell you the temperature range for each number of dots, but I don&#x27;t want to memorize that. I&#x27;ve learned that 3 dots is my ideal setting, so maybe this is a nit-picky criticism. Because I&#x27;ve seen a couple reviews mention heat-up time I will say that I don&#x27;t get this complaint at all - I turn my iron on when I start my makeup, and a few minutes later when I move on to using the iron it is hot and ready to go, and stays hot. So, my criticisms are minor and as of right now I&#x27;m really happy with this iron!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice flat iron.  It is very easy to use and works well.  It heated up really fast and the digital temperature display was easy to figure out, even without looking at the instructions.  I was able to iron my hair quickly and easily, and then use the iron to leave some crimps for body.  You can change the heat settings for the type of hair you have.  I used the lowest setting due to my fine, easy to damage hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the vapor feature.  You can put in the conditioning treatment (a small bottle is included) or distilled water into the reservoir and then press the vapor button while straightening.  The vapor will help protect your hair from damage, something I really appreciate since my hair is colored and damages easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great flat iron.  It works well, is very easy to use, and has a great bonus feature in the micro vapor.</li>
    <li> Remington S8700 T|Studio PROtect Flat Iron Straightener, 1-inch, Aquatic Green is an extremely well made product. For me the best hair irons are the 1 inch version. Some people like the thinner models as they are doing more precise fashions. This has settings that range from 300- 450 degrees which will make hair into less curly or straight as a board, depending on what your goal is. Easy to use and lightweight are all pluses that add to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plug it in and set the temperature you want and in a few short minutes its ready. The swivel cord makes it easy to maneuver around without tangle. The auto shut off feature for safety is another good addition that shows quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a tube of macadamia treatment that you can use while ironing your hair, or if you choose you can put water for some extra steam and moisture. The macadamia treatment really is nice and they do sell products similar to it at beauty supply stores for when the product runs out. I have not seen in stores or on Amazon replacement tubes from Remington to purchase but maybe they will make them available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be a little big for some peoples liking, but believe me, it is top quality. This is a Flat Iron Straightener that works amazingly well and is designed to last a long time. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The Remington S8700 T Studio PROtect Flat Iron has far exceeded my expectations. It softens my hair while it straightens it. I love the oil that it comes with the Flat Iron. I have used the flat iron for a few months and have not had to refill the reservoir yet. It&#x27;s not too heavy and makes my hair feel soft and healthy. The oil also helps prevent frizz, which is usually a very big problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically I use John Frieda Frizz Ease shampoo and conditioner to TRY and prevent frizz. Now, when I use those products AND the Remington S8700 T Studio PROtect Flat Iron, it lasts longer even in the most humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington S8700 T Studio PROtect Flat Iron is very easy to use.  At first I had some trouble but after a couple times I got used to the direction in which you have to hold it. The flat iron heats very quickly and I like that you can choose the temperature according to how thick and coarse your hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this flat iron to straighten my hair, not to curl it. I use a different curling wand when I want a curly look.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, my wife loves this wand and I will go one step further for any men looking in on this review... I truly think it may have helped my wife get ready closer to &amp;#34;on time.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This iron is very impractical. It is bulky and not designed well. The reservoir where you put the water in is very small and the oil only because it has a tip point easily goes in. The water doesn&#x27;t. On curly hair it doesn&#x27;t allow you to get close enough to the roots to smooth them out.</li>
    <li> This is essentially the Mercedes of flat-irons and a definite must if you&#x27;re in the market for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The presentation is very nice.  It looks like the kind of flat-iron you&#x27;d see in a salon.  It heats up fairly quickly and the temperature control lock and vapor infusion are a nice touch.  It really is a super fancy flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly we haven&#x27;t tried the macadamia oil yet, but judging from other Vine reviewers, it&#x27;s a nice touch and appears to help out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended as an addition to your daily styling routine.</li>
    <li> This is a SERIOUS little flat iron! I decided to see what it would do to my super curly hair and was amazed at how straight it got it from the root and how it has remained that way for DAYS. I think I am going to have to wash it to get the curl back. Great choice for a little switch up in hair styles without any permanence, and shockingly effective even as the humid days of summer begin! Highly recommended for all hair types, but be sure to moisturize your hair well so you don&#x27;t get any heat damage. It heats up that quickly and is that strong!</li>
    <li> I have used a number of flat irons over the last fifteen year (including an earlier Remington). I was pleased with this flat iron. I found that it performed just as well as other professional flat irons that are sold at the is price point. It also had a few extra features which my other irons do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this Flat Iron different from previous ones I have owned is the cool micro-vapor technology that helps to moisturize and protect the hair from heat damage. It was fairly easy to use. The iron comes with a small water reservoir that contains a wick that feeds the water to the iron. They do recommend using distilled water rather than tap water so that mineral build-up doesn&#x27;t clog the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron left my hair smooth, silky, and soft. I would say that it definitely felt softer than my traditional flat iron. this is only a one inch iron, but the actual unit itself is about twice that width. Half of the iron consists of the vapor dispenser making this wider than your standard 1 inch iron. I did find that it did a decent job of curling the hair under at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the 410 degree temperature (four lit circles) was what was required to tame my frizzy and wavy hair. The auto-shut off is also a nice feature. It also gives you the option of pressing down a button and locking the temperature in, but I didn&#x27;t really find this to be a necessary thing. This iron also locks shut for storage, which is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does include Macadamian Oil treatment that you can add to the reservoir, but the only downside is that I can&#x27;t find any place that sells additional oil treatment. The instructions said not to add other types of oils or treatments to the reservoir, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like you can just add any hair oil.</li>
    <li> This is an interesting product, and although I have used flat irons for many years (various brands, both cheap and expensive), this was something new for me. You use water and an (included) macadamia conditioning treatment to &amp;#34;supply cool micro vapor that absorbs into hair, protecting it from damage while you style.&amp;#34; Sounds awesome, but does it work? Yes! I think it leaves my hair *much* smoother and silkier as opposed to a flat iron alone! I was pretty impressed. Plus, you only have to go over a section once, which will help your hair in the long-run because it won&#x27;t be as damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also some good features on this iron. It goes up to 450, which should be adequate for the vast majority of hair types (I personally have thick, wavy hair). There are five heat settings in all, so if you like to go to a specific degree, this may not work for you. The options are 450°F, 410°F, 375°F, 340°F, and 300°F. It does have a temp lock mode (yay!) so if you accidentally push a button you don&#x27;t have to start all over. It also has 60 min auto shutoff, which is a nice safety feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an attractive iron - if that matters to you - and I really appreciate that it has a hinge lock for easier storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the iron says you can use it to make curls, for some reason I found it harder to use to do this than my ancient Chi iron. I might get the hang of it eventually, though! For now, I&#x27;m thrilled it does such a  great job straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Best ever I have curly frizzy hair. I live in Pittsburgh and the summers are hot and humid. I never thought I would ever have straight hair in the summer, but with his iron, I do and it looks good.</li>
    <li> I love it so much I gave my Chi away.  I especially love how you can control the heat and the super wonderful oil infuser.  My dry, damaged hair so appreciates it.</li>
    <li> My wife has several flat straightener and she tried this one, voila liked this as well. It is a thin, easy to handle straightener and heats up real quickly and in an elegant fashion  does the task . The plates are distinctively elegant as well and the cord is fairly long. I have put an image just to show the contrast of how the end product, your hair will look like.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Smooth, soft, and shiny.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s the first thing my friend said after using the new Remington Protect Flat Iron. The first time she tried it we didn&#x27;t read the instructions so we didn&#x27;t know we were supposed to put water in it, and the results were less than spectacular. After going back and following the instructions we figured out how to properly use the flat iron. Her hair looked spectacular and was straight and smooth.. The flat iron worked quickly and got very hot. It was probably the best her hair has ever looked. The water created a steam that really helped lock her hair in place. She said she will never go back to using a regular flat iron again after using this Remington model. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works VERY well; tends to keep hair a little softer than a cheaper flat iron we have used, so the claims of straightening with less damage to hair seem to be true. Nice controls and heats fast as well. Definitely made for longer hair, so it is a little more cumbersome to use on medium-length (my son&#x27;s &amp;#34;rock band&amp;#34; length) hair.</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;guest&amp;#34; review by my wife. My short gray hair is incompatible with the PROtect Flat Iron. My wifes curly main is another story. Even though I did not personally use the iron I can state it definitely flattened her hair. Anyway, what follows is my wife&#x27;s review of the Remington S8700:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron does a solid job.  My hair is naturally curly and it glided through the straightener very smoothly, no snagging at all.  The vapor infusion chamber was a hassle to fill.  However, my hair stayed soft and smooth, so it was worth the trouble.  I had a lot less frizz from this straightening iron then my old one.  The cord was a good length and made it easy to work with.  The directions say to make sure your hair is dry.  I had an area that wasn&#x27;t completely dry and it did not straighten well.</li>
    <li> OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been using this for a couple of weeks and really enjoys the Remington Flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three major pros to this device.  First, it heats so quickly that she doesn&#x27;t have to spend much time at all waiting to do her hair.  She also said it works to straighten and smooth hair very quickly.  Second, she&#x27;s used it to straighten our tween daughter&#x27;s hair, which is curly. It works wells to straighten curly hair as well as to smooth already straight but frizzy hair. With a quick heat-up time, the time spent on her own hair as well as our daughter&#x27;s hair is short. Apparently, this is a big plus for busy ladies (so she says)!  Third, this flat iron has a pretty neat feature of conditioning hair when a reservoir is filled with a special conditioning treatment (included in our box), and a special vapor button is pushed and activated. My wife really likes the conditioning feature, to help protect hair when using heat for styling.  She said there was no cons to this product, although I think that the price may keep it out of the hands of many who are cost-conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this was only used on two types of hair styles, it likely will work for women with various types of hair.  This is apparently a great product--my wife recommends 5-stars and who am I to disagree!</li>
    <li> My wife uses a variety of hair straighteners, including one Remington Flat Iron that is very similar to this one, only it does not have the conditioner vaporizer, and has a digital temperature gauge where this one does not. She would rather have the digital temperature gauge while this one simply has 5 red dots that indicate the temperature setting, with no labels. Consult the instructions for the appropriate temperature setting for your thickness and body of hair.  Overall it works very well, similar to the other, its a quality straightener, heats up fast, and the tangle-free swivel cord is great. A hook to hang it when it is cooling might be a nice minor addition. The conditioner vaporizer was the key selling feature of this model, and she was not very impressed by it. On clean, shampooed hair, that had no other conditioner treatment, she found the conditioner initially gave a clean, smooth, and shiny feel to the hair--however, it quickly became unusually oily the next day. With normal wash-in conditioners, she doesn&#x27;t experience this. She did however like the option of vaporizing water into the hair as opposed to the conditioner, and would probably choose to use her regular hair conditioners instead. Also, the conditioner leaks regularly from the compartment in the straightener.  One other feature to note is that there is a locking feature, which disables all the temperature, power, and vaporizer power buttons, to keep you from changing settings.</li>
    <li> The raison d&#x27;être of the Remington S8700 T|Studio PROtect Flat Iron is to straighten hair. It does that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its unique feature is the vapor infusion. Basically, it protects your hair from the intense heat of the device. It does that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set-up is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is it feels clunky. This is a design issue, not a quality of product concern. The handle and moisture dispenser feel wide, making straightening hair somewhat cumbersome. In short, the bigger your hands, the less this will bother you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a hit in our home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(tested by my wife as I watched several times)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony Trendl&lt;br /&gt;anthonytrendl.com</li>
    <li> My first experience with a flat iron was several years ago. The stylist showed me how to use it, and said to never iron dry hair or it will burn and frizz. At the time, we used Aquage shine spray and I shelled out $100 for a professional ceramic flat iron. If you have long hair, a flat iron will get out the weird natural bends and twists and make your hair look shiny and awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several years later, I became lazy and gave up on using the flat iron and I&#x27;m not even sure if shine spray is still in style. Products seem to come and go, and I may be a bit out of the loop. In comes the Remington PROtect Flat Iron, this thing works as good as the professional flat iron plus it infuses my hair with moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Macadamia Conditioning Treatment, this stuff smooths and conditions and keeps hair from being damaged while adding moisture. This is actually a great product and a really nice flat iron. If you have the time to use it, your hair will look awesome.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this and even with her straight hair, enjoys the Remington Flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it heats so quickly that she doesn&#x27;t have to spend much time at all waiting to do her hair. (Always a win, am I right?) She also said it works to straighten and smooth hair very quickly. Another win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, she&#x27;s used it to straighten our tween daughter&#x27;s hair, which is curly. It works wells to straighten curly hair as well as to smooth already straight but frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Again, with a quick heat-up time, the time spent on her own hair as well as our daughter&#x27;s hair is short. This is a big plus for busy ladies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, this flat iron has a pretty neat feature of conditioning hair when a reservoir is filled with a special conditioning treatment (included in our box), and a special vapor button is pushed and activated. My wife really likes the conditioning feature, to help protect hair when using heat for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My vote, because why disagree with a happy wife, is this is a great product and likely will work for women with various types of hair.</li>
    <li> I noticed many people were given these free as long as they gave  unbiased feed back. I read all the reviews avidly as I now have 4 straighteners so I didn&#x27;t want to waste any more money ( I did not receive mine free). I have very fine hair, quite wavy and the Florida frizz was driving me crazy. Well, this is probably the cheapest straightener I have bought and the best, at this stage (I have had it a month) I am loving it. I have not used it with oil yet but use the water option, I do see it says you must use filter water or otherwise the wick will clog, I am a bit unsure why oil doesn&#x27;t clog the wick or if you have to clean or replace it ever which is why I have only given it 4 stars and not 5. I also find I am not having to straighten my hair every day, yet another plus. I want to contact Remington to see if I can use it overseas with a reverse voltage converter as I would hate to damage it. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t discover this product earlier as it would have saved me a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this straightener.  I figured the oil compartment was just a gimmick, but I liked the other aspects of the straightener, so decided to try it.  I often use the straightener without the added oil, but have been pleasantly surprised with the oil delivery system as well, so I use that on occasion too.  Good solid Remington straightener -- no complaints, and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron, it straightened my hair perfectly!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a straightener. I wanted to use it on my daughter, so I was extra careful to read the directions. The directions were very clear and easy to understand. The straightener heats up quickly and is easy to use. I liked the steam feature, and look forward to trying the free sample of oil. It held enough water, that we had enough steam for the whole use. Overall the straightener did its job of straightening her slightly wavy hair, and neither of us were burned in the process.</li>
