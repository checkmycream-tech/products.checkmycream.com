      <li>I love the product and have noticed the difference.</li>
      <li>I have been wanting to try Wen products for a while now, but didn&#x27;t really want to spend a lot just to test it, so I was happy to find these 6 oz bottles.</li>
      <li>I am SO glad I was able to try this product...</li>
      <li>Smells like a spa (more like rosemary than lavander).</li>
      <li>Like the sixthirteen cleansing treatment much much better.</li>
      <li>LOVE it...</li>
      <li>I love  the lavender, it is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love all of them</li>
      <li>-  finish my shower routine while WEN rest and works it&#x27;s magic.</li>
      <li>and I have tried too many products to count</li>
      <li>Glad this product is offered on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I sing the praises of WEN and encourage you to commit to a healthy change, try WEN to see and feel the difference.</li>
      <li>I have used WEN for a number of years &amp; love it.  </li>
      <li>I have followed the directions, used more product than recommended</li>
      <li>I bought more :)</li>
      <li>my hair is much more shiny and not as fly-a-way if that makes sense.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This works better as a leave-in conditioner and nothing else.</li>
      <li>always I just wish it was more affordable.</li>
      <li>Now that it is offered through Amazon, I am able to get better deals on it.</li>
      <li>But I have purchased WEN products for a couple years and have always enjoyed the smell of them.  </li>
      <li>This one, Lavender, one of my favorite plants, smells like medicine.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Wen!!!!</li>
      <li>This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>After shampooing and rinsing I can easily glide a comb through my hair which is eliminating so many split ends.</li>
      <li>Plus I love the way it makes my scalp feel all clean and &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; :)</li>
      <li>This product was just as I expected that it would be - wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Hassle free is buy it from somewhere else even if its $5.00 dollar more.  </li>
      <li>A great scent for early spring.&lt;br</li>
      <li>buy premium shampoos/conditioners ($20-50 for a month&#x27;s worth of effective product is not unreasonable to me).  </li>
      <li>and once I use it on my hair, my hair is manageable and easy to style.</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t sure that my head would feel clean.  </li>
      <li>It felt more like a conditioner however it did clean my hair but not my scalp.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance is too strong.  </li>
      <li>I strongly reccomend the Wen hair care products.</li>
      <li>I have a question, are you supposed to shampoo your hair first with your own shampoo?</li>
      <li>and I have fine hair but lots of it.</li>
      <li>Overall, it gave my hair and scalp a good clean and leaves a nice shine with styling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m certain most people will love the results for their hair...</li>
      <li>There is a huge improvement in the softness and split ends of my hair.</li>
      <li>The Lavender is by far the best out of the Wen line, it moisterizes and leaves my hair soft and manageable without feeling oily.  </li>
      <li>This product cleans thoroughly and leaves hair in fantastic condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fortunately the damage wasn&#x27;t permanent.  </li>
      <li>From the first use, I felt the smoothness of my hair - just phenomenal conditioning.  </li>
      <li>I tried the lavender first, as it is my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>After seeing all the hype I was so excited to try Wen.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. I have fine thin curly hair and I have tried too many products to count but this is by far the best. Follow the instructions and rinse very well, l use 8 pumps and wash my hair twice week I don&#x27;t need hairspray, oil, gel, shine, or anything else because this covers it all and has saved me time, on top of that my hair looks and feels fabulous.&lt;br /&gt; Everyone&#x27;s hair is different but this is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try Wen products for a while now, but didn&#x27;t really want to spend a lot just to test it, so I was happy to find these 6 oz bottles. I also bought this in Fig, and received my order in 2 days, I&#x27;ve only tried it once, but hair seems really shiny. I have really thick, coarse hair that has to be blow-dried and flat-ironed, after using this the one time, my hair needed less flat-ironing and felt so soft. The Lavender smells amazing! I&#x27;m anxious to see how does after using it for a while!</li>
    <li> I have tried the Wen Fig, Almond Mint, and Lavender conditioning shampoos.  They are each fantastic, and I will never use regular shampoo again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel as I ordered the larger bottle.  This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  My hair is course and once I use it on my hair, my hair is manageable and easy to style.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s totally misleading to market this as a replacement for shampoo. It simply doesn&#x27;t clean your scalp. It&#x27;s as if you put hair conditioner on every day instead of shampoo. You have to use 20+ pumps per the directions, which is nuts. I did like it as a conditioner. Made my hair easy to comb when used as a regular conditioner. It&#x27;s super expensive. Smells like a spa (more like rosemary than lavander). If you have dry, dull hair, consider another route (like vitamins, less use of a hair dryer, etc.) than buying this overpriced hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> Just not what I expected, leaves hair feeling a bit greasy, yuck! I used this for a week, at the end of a week my hair felt like a wig, I just don&#x27;t like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I have been using it for several years. It is very gentle in my hair and leaves it feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  The Lavender is by far the best out of the Wen line, it moisterizes and leaves my hair soft and manageable without feeling oily.  The smell is a little strong, but I happen to like lavender, and the tingly sensation on my scalp really wakes me up.  The only thing to keep in mind is the usage directions.  Do not follow them.  There is no need to use 25-30 pumps to clean your hair.  I have shoulder length, thick hair and my daughter has hair down her back, we use between 9 and 12 pumps and that is more than enough.  Practice and be your own judge.</li>
    <li> This product worked as described, smelled really nice but was prohibitively expensive. I started using plain old suave conditioner in the same way you would use wen, the kind without any dimethicone  (or any other type of &amp;#34;cone&amp;#34; in it) and guess what? It works exactly the same for about 3 bucks a bottle. But if you have the money to burn, wen is a nice luxury.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that a friend turned me onto Wen shampoo as my hair feels healthy now.  After shampooing and rinsing I can easily glide a comb through my hair which is eliminating so many split ends.</li>
    <li> I did not want to buy gallons of this on HSN on an automatic shipping plan, so I was thrilled to see this little 6 oz pump bottle for sale on Amazon.  I use red Bumble &amp; Bumble shampoo &amp; conditioner and I have for many years and plan to continue to.  Now, after I shampoo, I add three squirts of WEN to three squirts of B&amp;B red conditioner, rub in well into my scalp and hair and leave it on while I shower.  I do this daily.  My hair is so soft, yet manageable.  A few fluffs with my hands and I have great curly hair.  I don&#x27;t have curly hair! In the past, I&#x27;ve had to use stiff or sticky products to get my hair to cooperate.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I am still working on figuring out how to correctly apply this product but I will say this.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately the biggest change I noticed is my hair does not fall out!! Before using Wen after shampooing and after applying conditioner I spent much too much time getting the hair off my hands. I was always cleaning up hair in my bathroom floor. Not anymore that stopped right away. There is a huge improvement in the softness and split ends of my hair. I bought more :)</li>
    <li> Completely LOVE this stuff! Works great! I have been using it for about 2 years and it has totally transformed my hair! I used to be a frizzball, now I don&#x27;t even straiten my hair. This stuff has worked a miracle on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product, kind of cool to be able to wash your hair and give it a deep conditioning treatment at the same time.  I have long blond, very oily, thin hair and it actually cleaned my hair quite well.  Unfortunately, you do have to use A LOT of the product each time you use it, so it can get expensive after a while.  I switched to Hair One and it works just the same except it doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good as the lavender Wen.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I had my hair foiled and highlighted on Dec 17th and Ive been regreting it everyday since! When i washed my hair it was SUCH a rats nest! I couldnt get a comb through it and it was breaking. When it was dry it was damaged looking, dry, and frizzy!! I spend over $60.00 since i had my hair done on shampoo, conditioner, sprays, ect. NOTHING helped!!! I bought wen a few days ago and got it today! When i used it tonight it was AMAZING!!! My hair is silky soft and has a beautiful healthy shine! I would recommend this to anyone and will NEVER use anything else!!!!!!! Thanks Wen!!!!</li>
    <li> I am SO glad I was able to try this product...it works miracles on my hair!!!  Love it and will defaintly continue to buy wen products!!  It&#x27;s pricey...but worth it.</li>
    <li> We like the product as a conditioner, and can use it \\&quot;solo\\&quot; for multiple \\&quot;rinsings\\&quot; of the hair but we still need a good shampoo at least once a week.</li>
    <li> I love  the lavender, it is my favorite. All of the Wen products can not be beat. I love all of them</li>
    <li> This product was just as I expected that it would be - wonderful.  The price would good also.  I will be ordering this product from this website again in the future because of the price.</li>
    <li> I was experiencing extremely dry, dull, and unruly hair and Wen Lavender Cleansing Conditioner has definitely helped me restore some moisture and liveness into my hair. I will difinetely continue buying this product, but I&#x27;ll have to purchase the tea tree next time because I&#x27;ve learned it does wonders for scalp dryness as well.I only gave it a 4-star because my hair has not completely gone back to a healthy stage, but I&#x27;m only hoping it&#x27;s just a matter of time.</li>
    <li> I could not wait to try this....especially after seeing the tantalizing infomercials. So sorry WEN, this was a disappointment. This dragged my fine hair down, and the lavender fragrance I longed for quickly disappeared.</li>
    <li> Really fast shipping and a really great price!  Good experience!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This left a dry feeling when it first was drying.  There was no volumn.  It just hangs and looks greasy.  It did good on hair not getting tangeled.</li>
    <li> This is nothing against the vendor, because they were extremely responsive.  But I have purchased WEN products for a couple years and have always enjoyed the smell of them.  This one, Lavender, one of my favorite plants, smells like medicine.  I was very disappointed.  I&#x27;m glad I only got the small size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this vendor that we purchased from, and I love the WEN conditioner as conditioner (I use shampoo first).  My hair is always soft and detangled.  Just buy Orange, or Vanilla Mint, or anything other than this scent.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very greasy even though I used way less the recommended amount, and then tried more to see if it just was not washing out properly.  Loved the smell but did not do to my hair what the commercial said it would and I have fine hair but lots of it.</li>
    <li> My hair is natural and curly. I stopped using perms in my hair in January 2011. In April 2011 I cut all the perm out of my hair and went completely natural. I have 4b type hair as well. I order WEN Lavender because of a recommendation from my mother. It worked wonders on my hair. When I blow dried it, it would swing and look beautiful. Plus, it made it grow even faster. Then it became to expensive so I stopped using it and I could really tell the difference. My hair began to break off at the ends, it looked dull, and my naturally curly hair just looked like a frizzy Afro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward two years later, and I&#x27;m back to using it again. Now that it is offered through Amazon, I am able to get better deals on it. My hair has life in it again. People ask me if I use some kind of curling cream, or conditioner. Some even suspect that I use a texture perm/treatment until I tell them I wash my hair daily with this conditioner. I believe this conditioner will work wonders on those of use with all types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The models shown on the infomercials do not represent those of us with true African-American natural hair. However, I know for a fact that this conditioner works on our type of hair as well. I forget to mention that the lavender has a little bit of menthol in it so you can feel the vapors massaging your scalp. The scent relaxes me, and helps me fall asleep or at least calm down after a good work out. Nevertheless, don&#x27;t pass on this conditioner. It is so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Note*** WEN is not the same as &amp;#34;Hair One.&amp;#34; I used this product for two years and there is just no comparison. While &amp;#34;Hair One&amp;#34; is a good alternative, it still leaves the hair dry and you must add additional products back in to keep your hair moisturized. Therefore, don&#x27;t skimp on an this awesome product. Yes, it is expensive, but so worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I have used WEN for a number of years &amp; love it.  Cleanes hair well&amp;  leaves hair soft &amp; clean.  Ipurchased this one for my niece who had hospitalized from complications witth Lupus.  She loved having her hair cleaned &amp; brushed.  She  recently passed away but she was so happy when someone did her hair with WEN.</li>
    <li> Glad this product is offered on Amazon.  I have thick course hair and noticed a change after the first use.  I was not looking for texture change but softening.  Natural hair is more manageable.  I suggest going to Chaz &#x27;s website to learn about the product and how to use it</li>
    <li> Made my hair soft and shiny.  Great product!  Would highly recommend.  Especially great for hair that is colored. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Like the sixthirteen cleansing treatment much much better.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a fair price.  Works as advertised and would buy again.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this cleansing conditioner</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever used. If you want shiny health hair by Wen.  I strongly reccomend the Wen hair care products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Wen, what more to say.</li>
    <li> I would give this 5 stars if it contained more product. I have very course/curly hair and I practically used the entire bottle for 1-2 washings. Overall, it gave my hair and scalp a good clean and leaves a nice shine with styling.</li>
    <li> WEN is over rated, it didn&#x27;t anything different then a store shampoo would do for me. I know everyone is different but it didn&#x27;t to anything for me. I tried this for about 4 weeks now and no change in my hair at all. I will not buy again</li>
    <li> I have a question, are you supposed to shampoo your hair first with your own shampoo? Or does this product act like a shampoo as well as conditioner?</li>
    <li> It does not clean my hair.  I have to use a different shampoo first and then this is more like a conditioner. Not impressed.  It isn&#x27;t any better than other conditioners I&#x27;ve used and way too expensive. Glad I only got a sample size bottle.</li>
    <li> The seller got this to me many days before it was due . I am still trying the product out so not sure of it at this time .</li>
    <li> Love all the different scents of Wen Cleansing Conditioner - my hair is clean yet soft with no tangles - this even beats baby shampoo that I had to use due to my hair being so thick and curly.</li>
    <li> After seeing all the hype I was so excited to try Wen. Boy I was I let down. I tried both the tea tree and lavender. Using them for a couple months each. My entire experience lasted 6 months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is to the middle of my back. It is pretty kinky and I sometimes straighten it. I tried the lavender first, as it is my favorite scent. And this stuff smells amazing.  It is also a pretty thick consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff left a lot of build up on my scalp and my hair felt so oily and gross. I usually wash my hair once or twice a week, but after using this I had to wash it daily.</li>
    <li> Up to the WEN standards, a nice addition to the many flavors of WEN. A great scent for early spring.&lt;br /&gt;As always I just wish it was more affordable. I cannot afford to use WEN everyday so I use it 2 times a week &amp; as a leave in 2 times a week alternating the days. I have really long thick hair, a 6oz bottle of Wen is only good for 2 uses at best.</li>
    <li> Wow! is all I can say.  I am 65 with long fine hair, and it has been a veritable rat&#x27;s nest after washing, even with conditioner, FOREVER!  I have tried every hair product known to man or woman.  A friend told me about Wen and although disbelieving it could be any better than what I&#x27;ve already tried, I figured why not?  After towel drying my hair, I combed it through- NOT A SINGLE SNARL! For me this is a miracle. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> My hair feels bouncy and soft and is much more manageable. I have very fine, dry hair with some body to it but this product makes it feel thicker and less brittle. Love love love it!! Plus I love the way it makes my scalp feel all clean and &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> but a strange lavender.  I like the conditioner/cleanser as well as the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.  It works wonderfully.  I do not use it every time I shampoo because my hair tends to feel greasy if I do.  Too dang expensive though!</li>
    <li> have bought for myself, my mother and my sister. my mother and I have fine, thin hair. LOVE it...she loves it too. great product. give it 2-3 days to realize how great it is.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute little bottle. I have used Wen before and really like how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> love the scent and works amazing! Gentle lavender scent and it makes my hair incredible soft, voluminousness and manageable. I&#x27;ve never found a cleanser that works like this.</li>
    <li> I am at the end of my first bottle and I really like this stuff.  I was surprised at first that it was so thick and felt more like a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure that my head would feel clean.  But it does and my hair is much more shiny and not as fly-a-way if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;This is typically the worst time of the year for my hair, with the heat on in the house and the dry winter air. I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Over the past 3 years, WEN and I have developed a great relationship. Wen cares for my scalp and hair, leaving my locks looking healthy, feeling silky and me happy.  I sing the praises of WEN and encourage you to commit to a healthy change, try WEN to see and feel the difference. Wet head, add WEN - Massage onto scalp and throughout hair  -  finish my shower routine while WEN rest and works it&#x27;s magic. Rinse  your scalp and hair to remove WEN. Ta-Da. It&#x27;s that simple my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My hair is so much more managable when I use it! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy nor does it weigh it down!</li>
    <li> A little tingly on the scalp, but great other wise.</li>
    <li> Love it, makes my hair soft and manageable, however I just cannot afford to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I tried every expensive shampoo and deep conditioner on the market.  Nothing worked on my hair except super 10.  But Wen products are the ultimate.  My hair is soft and manageable, and when there is no humidity I actually have salon looking hair.  This product is for dry, brittle,damaged hair.  My hair is a bit more oily in dry weather with this product, but its benefits out weigh the oiliness. It has restored my hair.  I will never use another product.  All products sold in a beauty shop or salon do not match the quality of what Wen products have done with my hair.  Amen to Chaz Dean for creating a product so wonderful.  Also to avoid a contract I buy my products either off E-bay or Amazon.  Wen shampoo website is very aggressive in marketing.  They will charge your credit card every 3 months and send you their product.  You can&#x27;t just buy one item off their web site, and never get charged again, unless you call them.  Hassle free is buy it from somewhere else even if its $5.00 dollar more.  Its worth it.  No contracts, no hard selling.</li>
    <li> I used the product as a shampoo.  It felt more like a conditioner however it did clean my hair but not my scalp.  I had to use my old product Matrix to get the clean feel I was looking for.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> It works well and keeps my hair from being frizzy. I don&#x27;t use a much as they say since my hair is very fine.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really decide if I like this product or not. On the one hand, my hair felt really clean but conditioned. But, I still had to use another anti-frizz product for styling.  And, since Wen recommends 15 pumps of the cleansing conditioner per use, I went through the bottle in less than a month - and that&#x27;s with me only washing my hair every other day. I&#x27;m going to back to my old shampoo/conditioner for now.</li>
    <li> I used the product like suggested. The tingling was a bit much because I have sensitive scalp but I guess it is necessary for the cleaning aspect.  I am going to have my beautician apply it next time in order to avoid it washing down on my body. Did not like it in the shower.  Overall I liked the product it left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Really loved this product! Saw a difference in my hair after one use. Should have bought a bigger bottle, though. I&#x27;m gonna order the almond-mint one next time. :)</li>
    <li> WEN is a good product especially if you have dry hair. Personally, I can&#x27;t use it for more than 2 days in a row because my hair will feel greasy at the roots. I have followed the directions, used more product than recommended (is what the website says), and I rinse it out very well. So, every other wash I&#x27;ll use a sulfate free shampoo. I do have fine hair though, so maybe it would be better suited for thick hair. It does make your hair VERY soft and lightweight however, so I do recommend it!</li>
    <li> MY HAIR.... I have very curly hair, just over the shoulder.  My hair isn&#x27;t fine, but definitely not coarse either.. soft but tight curls. My normal choice of styling products include Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Milk creme and Fructis Curl Styling Creme... both keep my curls bouncy and minimizes the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 3 - 4 years ago I had tried WEN, but after a few uses I had a crazy allergic reaction.  Around the same days I began using the product, I ate soft shell crab, and I wasn&#x27;t sure which of the two were the cause of my allergies - my face was burning up.  After 2 benadryls I was back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of years and being inticed by the infomercials, I figured, let me try it again. I bought the 6 oz lavender cleasing conditioner.  From the first use, I felt the smoothness of my hair - just phenomenal conditioning.  The scent is wonderful also.  After 3 uses... I began feeling a burn on my scalp.  I often use head &amp; shoulders to relieve some dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis... but after using WEN, my scalp was on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame, because I really enjoyed the feel of my hair, but I cannot continue to use the product any where near my scalp.  I will see if I am able to continue using it as a conditioner for the ends, but keep as far from the scalp as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend buying a small bottle, 6 oz or less, trying the product for 3 - 4 uses.  I&#x27;m certain most people will love the results for their hair... but it would be enough time to know if you have an allergic reaction to it, as I do.</li>
    <li> Product is overrated. Wasn&#x27;t impressed, and waaay too costly.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is too strong.  For that reason I only used it once so I can&#x27;t speak as to any of the other qualities of this product but I have used Wen produces before and they have been excellent.  My daughter uses Wen exclusively for her hair products and she loves all of them.</li>
    <li> I think this product would be great for people with dry to normal hair.  My hair is oily, so it makes my hair very greasy, however, I use it once a week &amp; it makes my hair soft &amp; shiny.  I give it 3 stars for me, but I am sure it is a 5 star for other types of hair!</li>
    <li> This is probably better than no name grocery store shampoo, but compared with other organic shampoos and conditioners, it was lousy.  I have very fine, thin  hair and this completely dried it out and left it dull and lifeless.  Fortunately the damage wasn&#x27;t permanent.  Glad I got the smallest bottle!</li>
    <li> deeply conditions and leaves a calming scent</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product give tons of volume and my hair is healthier after using it.&lt;br /&gt;One word: you really have to rinse your hair well after using this product.</li>
    <li> Wen is advertised as this AMAZING hair transforming miracle, but does NOTHING. It worked NO BETTER than my REGULAR 5 dollar shampoo from walmart.&lt;br /&gt;What a HUGE waste of money. I was HIGHLY disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and I love it! I will keep using it forever! I love the way my hair feels!</li>
    <li> Pay attention to the size, because for this price you an buy a bigger size. I love the product and have noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> Definitely still use regular shampoo. This works better as a leave-in conditioner and nothing else. If you use it all the time for your shampoo+ conditioner your hair ends up having so much buildup, not attractive and not manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this product 2 stars.... not because it doesn&#x27;t work (It does) but due to the instructions/poor value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have elbow length natural blonde and grey hair.... very oily scalp, dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the positive: This product absolutely worked on my hair.  The roots/scalp were effectively cleaned and the ends were well conditioned.  This product cleans thoroughly and leaves hair in fantastic condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaints are 100% about the reality of using this product.  Before buying, read the instructions... this product is not used in the same method as other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bottle, you are instructed to use 20-30 pumps of product.  I used half that amount and it was plenty.  However, even at 12-15 pumps per use, a 6oz bottle will only last 5-7 uses.  If you shower/shampoo daily, you will need a new bottle every week.  Can you afford to purchase this product weekly?  Can you justify that expense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other criticisms:&lt;br /&gt;While I was not able to use a wide-tooth comb in the shower, my hair de-tangled easily after the shower.  I had the comb in the shower and I tried to comb product through (per the instructions) but could not.  I simply could not get the comb through my hair at all!  Ironically, the same comb flew through my hair after the shower.  Again, A+ for detangling (product works!) and &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; for the instructions which are not helpful and set the wrong expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance of this product is pleasant but somewhat medicinal.  And it lasts.  You better like it, because it is going to stick with you for at least half the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that is my review.... I hate the instructions but the product works.  However, it is obscenely expensive when used as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy premium shampoos/conditioners ($20-50 for a month&#x27;s worth of effective product is not unreasonable to me).  WEN&#x27;s results are excellent but so are the results from other &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; hair products... There simply is not enough benefit to this product to justify the expense.ere simply is not enough benefit to this product to justify the expense.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product expecting a 16 oz bottle as this is the standard price for this size.  I admit I should have looked closely as it does say 6 oz. When the product arrive it was in an envelope and the conditioner had opened and spilled all over the envelope and bottle. There was no packing slip....nothing. I am not going to return this because I don&#x27;t trust I will receive a credit and I don&#x27;t want to pay for double shipping. I will only buy this straight from Amazon not this seller. This was a rip off!</li>
    <li> Left my hair gunky for months After only 2 uses no matter how many times I washed it with clarifying shampoo!</li>
