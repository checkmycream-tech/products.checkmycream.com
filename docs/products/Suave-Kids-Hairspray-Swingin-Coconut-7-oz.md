      <li>Very, very light hold.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think something with &amp;#34;light hold&amp;#34; and no alcohol would do much of anything, but I tested it on my own hair first and it worked great!</li>

      <li>Okay the grandkids (and grand nephews) love this.  </li>
      <li>My boys love using my hairspray.</li>
      <li>It smelled good at first.</li>
      <li>This is a kids product, but since I enjoy many of the smells marketed for children, I had to give this a try.</li>
      <li>It also washes out easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The spray dispensed easily.</li>
      <li>It was really strong.</li>
      <li>fragrance of coconuts is so strong than even after wearing it all day and going to bed</li>
      <li>This hairspray smells fine</li>
      <li>My daughter has fine, unruly hair, and this product worked like a dream for keeping her hair contained.</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s alcohol free.  </li>
      <li>but my daughter doesn&#x27;t enjoy using it.</li>
      <li>Add to that the enjoyable fragrance and it a product that works as well as it is fun to use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Recommended if you are looking for a light hold and don&#x27;t mind the fruit salad issues.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really light mister, so</li>
      <li>if all you want in a light hold.</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
      <li>Having this in the bag is perfect to tame that hair on the way to dinner afterward.</li>
      <li>I barely detected it-- but pleasant and not phony-smelling.</li>
      <li>Well worth it!</li>
      <li>and I was excited to see hairspray for children!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The hold was very satisfactory - even with my very fine hair.</li>
      <li>I loved that it was not sticky and alcohol free as I don&#x27;t want her breathing in the fumes from regular hairspray.</li>
      <li>Suave Kids Hairspray is alcohol free and has a decent hold, but I just am not sold on the scent, even though I love tropical and coconut fragrances.</li>
      <li>The aroma&#x27;s not bad either.  </li>
      <li>On special occasions when we want her hair to look extra nice, I&#x27;ve been using this Suave Kids Swinging Coconut hairspray on her.  </li>
      <li>The coconut is not overpowering, but has an undertone of something else, making it not as pleasant as I would have expected.</li>
      <li>liked that it was alcohol free and wouldn&#x27;t harm or dry out hair.</li>
      <li>and I have really been pleased with the whole line of Suave products meant for children.</li>
      <li>and it has a fun coconut fragrance.</li>
      <li>I rarely leave anything on my hair except leave in conditioner</li>
      <li>Why do kids have to have all the fun?</li>
      <li>It smells great, but it makes his hair way too stiff and &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>This hairspray works pretty well - it doesn&#x27;t leave her hair super crunchy or sculptable, but noticably increases hold and manageability, which is just what we were looking for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Like other Suave products, I really loved this hairspray.</li>
      <li>Not exactly like coconuts, but a nice, sweet smell.  </li>
      <li>I was glad that I had only sprayed two kids.</li>
      <li>Holds pretty well.  </li>
      <li>My son hates the smell of many hairsprays and actually likes this one, making putting it on much easier.</li>
      <li>It might be better to help support a barrette or pig tails or for special occasions where kids are less rambunctious.  </li>
      <li>Its kind of hard to use because its a pump bottle, but they were so excited to get it.  </li>
      <li>Found this product to be pretty much as it advertises.  </li>
      <li>so I can ignore the marketing as it does make using &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; cool even for a 4 year old boy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The smell is okay. Not too pina coloda smelling to me. Very, very light hold. Almost just like spraying scented water on your hair.  The kids like it though.</li>
    <li> Love it, works great!</li>
    <li> Smaller than I remember the store bottles being.</li>
    <li> I try very hard to keep my toddler&#x27;s hair out of her eyes.  She pulls out headbands and barrettes in seconds with this adorable &amp;#34;nice try mom&amp;#34; look on her face.  I&#x27;ve tried several products, and nothing seems to be working.  I&#x27;ve tried hair sprays, mousses and gels both for adults and for kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works for a short time, maybe an hour or so.  She&#x27;s very active.  This is a super light product, so it gives up after a few tumbles.  I don&#x27;t want to reapply it.  I would like this product a lot if it had a little better hold.  It might be better to help support a barrette or pig tails or for special occasions where kids are less rambunctious.  It&#x27;s just not great for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does wash out very easily.  Even with baby shampoo.  My daughter has never complained if it gets rinsed into her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells nice.  Not exactly like coconuts, but a nice, sweet smell.  It&#x27;s not too overwhelming for the little ones.  I like that it&#x27;s alcohol free.  It  doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  I do try very hard to keep the spray out of her eyes.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product with high expectation and hoped it would be useful for 6 year old daughter to keep her hair neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it we realized this product does not offer any advantage. few drops of coconut oil could do better job than this hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not  buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Nice lightweight hairspray for the kids. Has a nice light coconut smell. Girls love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter has weird hair.  It&#x27;s fine and blonde, but very textures in the back.  Her preschool kept putting her hair in ponytails, and I hate it.  She hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s 18 months - who cares if her hair is a mess of frizz?  Don&#x27;t torture her with rubberbands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I tried this product and suddenly instead of frizz, the back of her head is now filled with ringlets.  It&#x27;s just amazing.  It&#x27;s not at all crunchy/sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, to combat bead-head, I dampen my daughters hair with my wet hands and then spray this into her hair a couple of times.  Scrunch it, and for the rest of the day it&#x27;s just perfect soft curls instead of frizz.  No more rubberbands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great.</li>
    <li> This is a kids product, but since I enjoy many of the smells marketed for children, I had to give this a try. The coconut is not overpowering, but has an undertone of something else, making it not as pleasant as I would have expected. The spray itself is nice and creates a fine mist. Since this is a light hold, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but ended up finding that I could get away with just this spray when layered a second time. The hold was very satisfactory - even with my very fine hair. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and held the style as well as my normal brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that Suave Kids Hairspray is alcohol free and has a decent hold, but I just am not sold on the scent, even though I love tropical and coconut fragrances.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep the loose hairs from flying away, but you do have to make sure you hit any troubled areas good. It works well. It also has a pleasant scent. It also washes out easily.</li>
    <li> This hairspray smells fine but my daughter doesn&#x27;t enjoy using it. It might just be because she doesn&#x27;t like hairsprays in general. No harm in trying it for your child as everybody&#x27;s different.</li>
    <li> Its kind of hard to use because its a pump bottle, but they were so excited to get it.  They are old enough to want to use some hairspray, and this is working well for them.  There is no way it would work for my wife, but, for the kids, its working good.</li>
    <li> Sticky feeling, holds well, smells great.</li>
    <li> My toddler has crazy hair, as so many of them do.  And like so many other parents, I put her in the bath at night and do not want to deal with trying to wet her hair down again in the morning.  This spray is great because it is light enough not to make her delicate hair look greasy, but strong enough to tame that crazy mane.  She loves the &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; smell and loves that &amp;#34;doing her hair&amp;#34; is a part of our morning routine.  As an parent knows, getting the toddler to be willing to participate in the morning can be a challenge, so it is great to have something they WANT to do.</li>
    <li> Like other Suave products, I really loved this hairspray. My daughter has fine, unruly hair, and this product worked like a dream for keeping her hair contained. I loved that it was not sticky and alcohol free as I don&#x27;t want her breathing in the fumes from regular hairspray. It had a nice, light scent to it as well.</li>
    <li> Found this product to be pretty much as it advertises.  It&#x27;s not a super strong hold but helps keep hair in place.  Ive used it on my daughters hair when she wanted to wear it up in braids or ponytails to keep it looking nice all day and not have too may fly always.  She also takes dance and she needs to have a tidy bun that stays put throughout the practice, and this hairspray worked for that as well.  I don&#x27;t usually spray her hair when she wears it down, preferring a more natural approach, but did style her hair more on picture day and again this worked well for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light coconut smell is nice and I think appealing.</li>
    <li> I got the new Suave Kids light-hold hairspray in swingin&#x27; coconut for my kids. They need something to hold their hair in place while at school all day or it gets really messy by the end of the day. I did get the hairspray for them since it&#x27;s a kid&#x27;s formula but I used it myself as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really impressed with it. It has a pleasant coconut scent when spraying. The scent makes the hairspray smell which is still present not seem as bad. I didn&#x27;t notice that the scent stayed on my hair throughout the day and didn&#x27;t conflict with other products that I was wearing either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is a nice. It held my style and I could tell that I had hairspray in my hair but I still had nice movement and not just plastered down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked well for my kids as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked that it was alcohol free and wouldn&#x27;t harm or dry out hair.</li>
    <li> I use this on my 3 year old&#x27;s hair - it goes on easily but even for a small kid, you do have to use a lot to get the hold on crazy kid hair. But the scent is nice so it isn&#x27;too much of a chore to put it on her.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my two grandsons who have fine hair and often have fly-aways and need just a little bit of hold to make their hair stay styled and not turn into a mess throughout the day. This product smells good, it has a nice scent without being over-powering. The hold is enough for what I am looking for. I don&#x27;t know how well it would do on a girl&#x27;s long hair because as I said I use this product on two little boys. I like that it isn&#x27;t sticky and I don&#x27;t have to wash their hair every night to get gunky product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great product for kids and I have really been pleased with the whole line of Suave products meant for children.</li>
    <li> My one-year-old daughter has the same dark hair that sticks straight out in every direction that I do.  My wife was keeping it patted down with adult hairspray, but I was always on her case about it.  This Swinging Coconut Hairspray is a nice middle-ground.  It smells pleasant, but not overpowering.  It keeps the hair down, but isn&#x27;t gummy or heavy or sticky like typical hairspray can be.  You won&#x27;t get a lot of hold or control out of it, necessarily, but for a child it does the trick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my sons hair a few times. It smells great, but it makes his hair way too stiff and &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;. He says that it makes his head itch. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Okay the grandkids (and grand nephews) love this.  I think it is inpart just the color marketing...  However being a Suave product I know it is good quality at a good price so I can ignore the marketing as it does make using &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; cool even for a 4 year old boy.</li>
    <li> After it dries it looks like my daughter has dust all over</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thin hair and I was excited to see hairspray for children!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This items is safe for the environment (pump rather than spray) and has an interesting coconut smell to it.  Most kids will love to use it as does my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well on my daughter&#x27;s thin hair even though it takes a few pumps for it to work and &#x27;stick.&#x27;  Well worth it!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes. I had hopes of children with tidy hair in a family picture. If that is your dream, I suggest you find another way to achieve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray dispensed easily. It smelled good at first. But it doesn&#x27;t dissipate. If anything it gets stronger. I was glad that I had only sprayed two kids. It was really strong. The spray didn&#x27;t seem to make their hair sticky. So I was impressed by that. But it also didn&#x27;t make their hair stay in place. In addition to not keeping the hair in place, Suave Kid&#x27;s hairspray actually made the hair look worse after it got ruffled. It looked dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether this was a terrible idea. However if you would like dirty, messed up hair, that smells like it was made by The Professor from Gilligan&#x27;s Island then this is the hairspray for you.</li>
    <li> My boys love using my hairspray. . . I don&#x27;t know why, lol. Now they have their very own (which I love since they no longer use up mine). I like that it&#x27;s alcohol free and it has a fun coconut fragrance. It provides a fairly stiff hold which is just fine for little boy hairstyles.</li>
    <li> I have a long hair style, my hair being somewhat thin, and this spray is a far better holding spray for me than products meant for adults.  It&#x27;s especially good for disentangling tangles.  The aroma&#x27;s not bad either.  If you&#x27;re an adult male with problem hair, give this a try.</li>
    <li> Does NOT smell like coconut. It has a slight hint of vanilla and smells old.</li>
    <li> I am currently not trusting suave products on the children. The last bottle of Suave shampoo I had said to keep out of reach of children. I tried this hairspray on my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem that I found was the smell. It was pretty harsh at first, but it dissipated fairly quickly. The smell to this was not like any coconut I have ever tried before. It smelled like hair spray while it was going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked that this product did not have a sticky feeling to it. I rarely leave anything on my hair except leave in conditioner so I was surprised that it didn’t feel funny. My hair was perfectly soft.</li>
    <li> We go to the beach a lot and it&#x27;s not uncommon to have hair everywhere afterward.  Having this in the bag is perfect to tame that hair on the way to dinner afterward.</li>
    <li> I hate the yukky scent and the way they make your hair feel like a helmet.  But there comes a time when a kids need to have  his/her hair  stay neat for  a little while (like school picture day). This alcohol-free, allergen-free, pleasantly scented hairspray seems to be the answer. If you have a kid who is a hairspray-phobe  this might solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried it myself. I still don&#x27;t LIKE hairspray but I think I could learn to tolerate it with this one.</li>
    <li> Wow! I didn&#x27;t think something with &amp;#34;light hold&amp;#34; and no alcohol would do much of anything, but I tested it on my own hair first and it worked great! It gave a little lift to my bangs and kept them lifted for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very light-- I barely detected it-- but pleasant and not phony-smelling. It doesn&#x27;t seem to stick around, unfortunately. I&#x27;d love for us to go around smelling vaguely of coconuts all day. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m prone to fragrance-triggered migraines and this didn&#x27;t bother me at all. Love it, and now my daughter and I are both using it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light hair spray and I like the fact that it is hypoallergenic when using it on my grandchildren- a couple of which have wonderful? bed hair when they get up. That combined with cowlicks that cannot be tamed by wetting them down. This is a perfect hairspray for them with one exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance of coconuts is so strong than even after wearing it all day and going to bed I could smell the coconut smell on their pillowcases and had to change them for the next night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old daughter has very fine moderately curly hair, and it&#x27;s a chore to keep her from having \\&quot;crazy hair\\&quot;.  (Her term, not mine, ha ha.)  I always use some type of product like mousse or curl lotion in her hair after her bath, but sometimes that just isn&#x27;t enough.  On special occasions when we want her hair to look extra nice, I&#x27;ve been using this Suave Kids Swinging Coconut hairspray on her.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain any alcohol, and she loves the scent.  It gives a moderate amount of hold, and doesn&#x27;t make her hair hard.</li>
    <li> Suave Kids Swinging Coconut Hairspray is great for kids of any age. It even works for the adult &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; too. I love it for coconut scent and for the light hold my hair can use with casual, everyday styles. There are days I&#x27;m not going out and really don&#x27;t want to weigh my hair down with mousse or heavy hairspray. I just want my hair to look good. This product fits the bill! Add to that the enjoyable fragrance and it a product that works as well as it is fun to use. Why do kids have to have all the fun?</li>
    <li> This spray really holds hair in place and it also smells great. It has a light coconut scent that reminds me of the beach!</li>
    <li> This hairspray has a nice light coconut scent that is pleasing to me and my children. Just a small amount keeps hair in place. I actually prefer using this for myself--the old fashioned hairsprays aren&#x27;t for me. This has a light hold, nice scent and it&#x27;s affordable. Recommended.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thin hair that tends to fly away and frizz.  This hairspray works pretty well - it doesn&#x27;t leave her hair super crunchy or sculptable, but noticably increases hold and manageability, which is just what we were looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is stronger than I would prefer, especially at first.  Since all our daughter&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners are ALSO tropical scented, she can sometimes end up smelling like a fruit basket.  But although the scent is long lasting, it does fade over time, and by the time we leave the house, it&#x27;s manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended if you are looking for a light hold and don&#x27;t mind the fruit salad issues.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this on my own hair.  I like a bit of lift at the crown and hold, but hate that crunchy and hard to brush out feel that lots of hairsprays have.  Going on, it didn&#x27;t smell any different than other hairsprays, really.  However, once it was on I could smell a light coconut smell that was pleasant.  It&#x27;s a really light mister, so if you want a heavy dose you&#x27;ll have to squirt a few times on the same area.  Holds pretty well.  I&#x27;d buy it again for myself, cause it does work well if all you want in a light hold.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old son likes his hair spiky, and this stuff does the trick. It smells good, and will hold his hair in place for at least a whole morning 4-8 hours. My son hates the smell of many hairsprays and actually likes this one, making putting it on much easier. My only complaint is that as it holds it makes the hair pretty crunchy and then as the &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; breaks down from him playing with his hair, the hold breaks down a lot. I wish there was a little less crunch. Nevertheless, it works well and we use it without much complaint almost daily</li>
