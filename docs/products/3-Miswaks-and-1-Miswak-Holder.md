      <li>I have to buy more for my family.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also read another that said its more effctive than brushing.</li>
      <li>I read a study that said using miswak in addtion to brushing worked better than just brushing or just miswak.</li>
      <li>Great buy, actually tastes good, and teeth feel cleaner using it more than toothpaste and brush.</li>
      <li>I have not used this product and intend to do more research before I do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The holder was ok.  </li>

      <li>The more you use it the more you&#x27;d like</li>
      <li>I cannot tell you how much I love miswak, no wonder it was used since hundred of years.</li>
      <li>I have used the miswak shown and described in the posting, and it was the best, but what was shipped was a different brand</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!!</li>
      <li>price was reasonable however the taste wasn&#x27;t quite pleasant;  </li>
      <li>Easy to carry, I keep mine in a plastic toothbrush container.</li>
      <li>They easily shreds.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more and the seller was great too.</li>
      <li>the miswak is strong in flavor and may take some getting used</li>
      <li>The fact it is  natural made is good and make me t rust it more, but</li>
      <li>I learned about these sticks from some friends of mine and heard how much they liked them, so I decided to try them out.</li>
      <li>I like the secureness of the case and it is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>and my teeth always feel really smooth</li>
      <li>Wonderful fast shipping and low prices</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that they have a strong scent/flavor, but it&#x27;s nothing you don&#x27;t become accustomed to</li>
      <li>I love the fresh feel and the clean and shiny way my teeth feel.</li>
      <li>Mother nature never disappointed us.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a unique smell that might take time to get acquired to.</li>
      <li>Otherwise mejor my teeth clean.</li>
      <li>My mouth feels clean after I use it and it gets the food out from in between my teeth.</li>
      <li>I have also recently started using my own homemade tooth powder with the miswak which I believe helps whiten my teeth more than anything</li>
      <li>It makes it really easy to clean my teeth right after eating.</li>
      <li>cool</li>
      <li>On top of that fast service and products as advertised.</li>
      <li>so my teeth did not get a good enough chance to remineralize.</li>
      <li>Good product, came two days earlier than exptected</li>
      <li>I felt the sudden smell of a tree when I chewed it, but it was very refreshing and cooling too, and than the mouth have reacted just after 2 minutes, which means yes</li>
      <li>and I believe that they clean my teeth far better than any toothpaste/toothbrush combination.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it is really good at cleaning teeth and freshening your mouth in a whole different way than toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
      <li>In fact, virtually all of my sensitivity is gone, which I have never been able to do before even with toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>As advertised, the sticks were fresh.</li>
      <li>The miswaks are just as effective as a standard toothbrush.</li>
      <li>after reading a rave review for this product on a health blog and reading other good reviews on amazon i decided to buy one.</li>
      <li>Say goodbye to all the plaque you so fear, and embrace this product!&lt;br /&gt;Remember to get the best result, a little less consumption of sugar helps :)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Basically when I wake up, finish eating, after drinking a soda, and right before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They clean your teeth really well</li>
      <li>I have bought the sticks before starting in 2010 and they were fresh but since 2011 it&#x27;s been hit and miss with more spoiled sticks than fresh.</li>
      <li>Read reviews saying it has a strong chemical odor; it has a distinctive smell but its natural, its</li>
      <li>Very Reasonable price also.</li>
      <li>I really like these!</li>
      <li>I had heard about Miswaks from a friend and really wanted to try them out!</li>
      <li>This was my first time using this product.</li>
      <li>I first opened the package up</li>
      <li>Using these sticks has left my mouth feeling better</li>
      <li>I was kind of scared because it smelt a little funky but not moldy like others have said it was.</li>
      <li>and it really does leave your breath smelling pretty decent.</li>
      <li>The whole length is about 5 inches.</li>
      <li>,it cleanse my teeth very well.</li>
      <li>soft and powerful taste and smell.</li>
      <li>It feels really soothing on my gums and it gets some spots that a tooth brush can&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I like the holder that came with my order, but I don&#x27;t really carry mine around with me</li>
      <li>It was a fast arrival.</li>
      <li>I really like the Miswak stics</li>
      <li>I got my order in a very timely fashion.</li>
      <li>So I have been using a normal toothbrush for my whole life but not anymore.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would need to grow the miswak plant to have a steady supply.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I will be using this tooth brush from now on. I love the fresh feel and the clean and shiny way my teeth feel.</li>
    <li> I really like the Miswak stics,it cleanse my teeth very well. The holder works wery good, thanks a lot for a great product.</li>
    <li> They seem to be old. They easily shreds.</li>
    <li> really good quality miswaks</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good product, thank you!</li>
    <li> Was not fresh. Moldy.</li>
    <li> You get two Miswak sticks from the company shown in the picture and one in the holder from a company I avoided using (dry Miswak).  The holder is a plastic pen style case with a clip that is totally worthless (broke off). I like the secureness of the case and it is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried Miswak do yourself a favor and just try it for a month. You will NOT be dissappointed! I have been brushing for years and this is the CLEANEST my mouth and teeth have ever felt besides a dental cleaning. You had to wonder how teeth were brushed during the time of Christ and after. I will use this method from now on. On top of that fast service and products as advertised.</li>
    <li> That prevents your teeth from bacteria. Trust me. But you have to adjust to it&#x27; s smell.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product works but I do know that it&#x27;s not very conceivable to use this as it molds fast.  I would need to grow the miswak plant to have a steady supply. I got 3 miswaks one in a different wrapping than the others and one of the others had mold everywhere.  I do question whether the mold is even harmful.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it after lunch at work, after I eat a meal out and anytime I&#x27;m not at home. My mouth feels clean after I use it and it gets the food out from in between my teeth.</li>
    <li> Cannot abide the taste/smell.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product and intend to do more research before I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The research I have completed recommends this product.</li>
    <li> Is it supposed to smell like that? Whew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was difficult to put something that smells like that in my mouth since it had to pass under my nose to do so kept triggering my brain to tell my arm to get that thing the heck away from my face. I eventually did manage to bite it and it instantly turned to fibers and pulp that lodged themselves in my teeth. I then had to carefully brush and floss all that junk out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe another brand of chew sticks will be better</li>
    <li> I like the container it comes in, keeps the stick safe and it travels with me. Very Reasonable price also.</li>
    <li> its ok i have not quite used the actual sticks as yet but they seem ok but to shipping cost and clearing it here, foreign, its not worth it to me, just too costly...</li>
    <li> You have to get used to the smell and taste.  Otherwise, it is really good at cleaning teeth and freshening your mouth in a whole different way than toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how much I love miswak, no wonder it was used since hundred of years. My mouth feels so much better, and my teeth are getting whiter than ever.Natures best gift for everybody.</li>
    <li> As advertised, the sticks were fresh. This was my first time using this product. I followed the instructions which ends up looking like a paint brush. It&#x27;s got a unique smell that might take time to get acquired to. There are some articles online for those who prefer evidence. The miswaks are just as effective as a standard toothbrush. They just don&#x27;t possess the anti-microbial properties that mouth washes have.</li>
    <li> I had heard about Miswaks from a friend and really wanted to try them out! They&#x27;re perfect! Just what I wanted. It was a fast arrival. I will order from this person again once I need more! Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> The items that were shipped were different then what was shown in picture. I have used the miswak shown and described in the posting, and it was the best, but what was shipped was a different brand and it is horrible! Very weak sticks and they do not work at all. I will not be reordering from this seller since they did not deliver what was promised.</li>
    <li> super smelly, like they had went bad and are very raw. i like the dried sticks that come in a pound bag. if you like the dried ones, these are not the ones for you. i ordered 2 differnt kinds and they both smell the same. they could have went over.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try these because I&#x27;m one of \\&quot;those weirdos\\&quot; trying to green up my act and do things as naturally as possible. I learned about these sticks from some friends of mine and heard how much they liked them, so I decided to try them out. It&#x27;s true that they have a strong scent/flavor, but it&#x27;s nothing you don&#x27;t become accustomed to and it really does leave your breath smelling pretty decent. My teeth feel cleaner than they have in years....even those years that I used a Sonicare toothbrush and my own DIY toothpaste. Using these sticks has left my mouth feeling better and I feel like it&#x27;s removed stuff that my old toothbrush and paste/powder left behind. I also find myself using the miswak more often throughout the day than I used my toothbrush. I like the holder that came with my order, but I don&#x27;t really carry mine around with me, I just use mine whenever I get home and whenever I feel like my teeth could use a cleaning. I will definitely be buying more and the seller was great too. I got my order in a very timely fashion.</li>
    <li> I  am not so familar  with Eastern cultures herbs and plants, so using the Miswak have been a new experience for me. I felt the sudden smell of a tree when I chewed it, but it was very refreshing and cooling too, and than the mouth have reacted just after 2 minutes, which means yes it does remineralise your teeth. And get it, it&#x27;s ALL natural. It&#x27;s just like chewing on a tree, and i do not know what tree,  but it somehow made my teeth covered with liquid, which means it did the job of remineralising them, so to me, it speaks for itself. Say goodbye to all the plaque you so fear, and embrace this product!&lt;br /&gt;Remember to get the best result, a little less consumption of sugar helps :)&lt;br /&gt;  The fact it is  natural made is good and make me t rust it more, but you must brush your teeth with it, and not eat it. I prefer to use it between meals. You must give it a shut, because hey. Mother nature never disappointed us. This is no flouride, no  SLS(that&#x27;s inside your toothpaste-SLS)it&#x27;s no chemicals at all. Just natural product. So buy it and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.  it is good!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Make sure you use it regularly, don&#x27;t leave it in the miswak holder and let it dry and go bad.</li>
    <li> great case. soft and powerful taste and smell. Thin sticks.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for about 6 months now and I believe that they clean my teeth far better than any toothpaste/toothbrush combination. After brushing with this, the outer surfaces of my teeth feel smoother than they ever have with a toothbrush and it clears almost all of the food and plaque from between my teeth practically eliminating the need for flossing. I do still floss on occasion, but I have noticed that I hardly have any plaque to remove from between my teeth after using miswak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had sensitive teeth my entire life, and I did notice the sensitivity getting worse after a few months of using this. This was probably due in large to the fact that I only brushed once a day before I went to bed so my teeth did not get a good enough chance to remineralize. To fix this, I have also started chewing xylichew gum (also sold on Amazon)multiple times a day to kill the bacteria in my mouth. In addition, I have started using small amounts of a fluoride rinse every day. The combination of miswak, xylichew, and a fluoride rinse has made my teeth more white, and much less sensitive. In fact, virtually all of my sensitivity is gone, which I have never been able to do before even with toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth. I have also recently started using my own homemade tooth powder with the miswak which I believe helps whiten my teeth more than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the miswak did not do everything I needed for oral care, but it was a good start. I would most definitely recommend miswak in combination with the other steps I listed above.</li>
    <li> Understand this is supposed to be good for dental hygene but it really tastes bad. Trying to get used to it. Like the holder.</li>
    <li> I bought these last year and they were spoiled. I have bought the sticks before starting in 2010 and they were fresh but since 2011 it&#x27;s been hit and miss with more spoiled sticks than fresh. The holder was ok.  I think they should put a date on them or have better quality control.</li>
    <li> Miswak is used throughout south asia. Preferably I use miswak compared to a toothbrush that is made from chemicals, dyes and plastics.  Miswak has so many healthy qualities, that many people overlook.  Diseases start from the mouth. Miswak prevents gum disease and gingivitis as long as it is used correctly. It fights plaque, fights against cavities, removes bad breath and odors from the mouth. I like the bristles it cleans my mouth effectively.</li>
    <li> price was reasonable however the taste wasn&#x27;t quite pleasant;  Additionally after opening the vacummed miswask it started to mold.after several days. Additionally,  they had a lot of  coating that left me spitting out the extra coating. .  The miswak holders were great.</li>
    <li> I only received two Miswaks and a holder, not three. They were ok, I bought them just to try but I don&#x27;t think they are for me.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work but the buyer did refund my money.</li>
    <li> cool but the miswaks get dry ;(</li>
    <li> Love using these on my teeth my teeth feel great!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I&#x27;ve been using it for sometime now, before prayers and after meals and it works wonders. My teeth are cleaner, shinier and I don&#x27;t get bad breath any more. Try it for yourself. The more you use it the more you&#x27;d like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they also had these siwaks made out of Arak branches instead of just the tree roots.</li>
    <li> Good product, came two days earlier than exptected</li>
    <li> Its good it came in within 4 days their are 2 big ones and 1 skinny one inside the holder it&#x27;s not like the pic it smells because of the heat just open it and put it in the fridge</li>
    <li> Wonderful fast shipping and low prices</li>
    <li> Not really that imppressed. The taste is horrible.</li>
    <li> after reading a rave review for this product on a health blog and reading other good reviews on amazon i decided to buy one. Gotta say it&#x27;s a scam. No amount of chewing made this root form bristles. It just splintered into a chewed looking small root. While chewing it breaks up and you constantly have to spit out small particles. There is no way for it to reach your back teeth. Save your money!!!</li>
    <li> I was eagerly waiting for the sewak, but total disappointment. The sticks smell like nothing else, and it is a very bad smell. I cannot even draw it near my face. Total disappointment. This is clearly not a natural scent. I wonder how they process the tree to end up in these.</li>
    <li> Items had a pungent, rotting odor...  I thought perhaps that was what they were supposed to smell like, so I tried to use them anyway...  They crumbled and did not form anything resembling bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I attempted to contact the seller, my emails were ignored.</li>
    <li> I still have thick plaque on my teeth in the mornings that this just won&#x27;t get. It is less abrasive than. A toothbrush so I like to use it after I eat during the day. It feels really soothing on my gums and it gets some spots that a tooth brush can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical I suppose about these before I got them, but they definitely work! Go and toss your toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I love it !</li>
    <li> Miswaks are fine, the shipping service was good too but the title/description is misleading. It indicates that you will be purchasing 3 miswaks and one miswak holder- well there was no holder and one miswak missing. Not a lot of money but still, why lie? &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> One was not usable.  Otherwise mejor my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> It smells and tastes nasty. Way different than the normal miswak that we know</li>
    <li> I really like these! I&#x27;ve been using licorice root sticks for a few months and came across miswak stick after some research and I wanted to try them out. They clean your teeth really well and if you use them a few times a day plaque won&#x27;t form at all on your teeth. It seems like there&#x27;s never any plaque on mine and my teeth always feel really smooth, also my gums done bleed at all when I floss. I do still rinse, floss and brush once a day and use the miswak any where from 3 to 5 times a day. Overboard? Maybe...ever have a root canal? rest my case. I read a study that said using miswak in addtion to brushing worked better than just brushing or just miswak. I&#x27;ve also read another that said its more effctive than brushing. Either way it&#x27;s good for your teeth :) Easy to carry, I keep mine in a plastic toothbrush container. As far as the taste goes, it&#x27;s kinda like ginseng to me but very faint. If ur turned off by the taste (or you want to mix things up a bit) you could soak the bristles in some rose water which is really nice. You could search around for flavored miswak too. Al Khair also makes lime and mint. Both flavors are good. Some other miswak come in clove and cinnamon too.</li>
    <li> Read reviews saying it has a strong chemical odor; it has a distinctive smell but its natural, its what gives the miswak antibacterial properties. I bought this because I&#x27;m backpacking trails for a couple months and didn&#x27;t want to put toothpaste chemicals in the environment. Great buy, actually tastes good, and teeth feel cleaner using it more than toothpaste and brush. Only thing I would change is make the case out of recycled plastic.</li>
    <li> It does not taste as i expected it too :/</li>
    <li> The best thing for me. the smell is strange but really no odd taste. I have to buy more for my family.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service! I am very happy with this and would like to buy more. I definitely recommend this seller as well as the product. The miswaks and holder work great!</li>
    <li> So I have been using a normal toothbrush for my whole life but not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these because I was ordering something else and had a few dollars left in my account. At first I as a bit skeptical but I now prefer them over the traditional toothbrush and paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the package up I was kind of scared because it smelt a little funky but not moldy like others have said it was. I peeled off the bark then chewed on the inner part for awhile. After it formed bristles I brushed my teeth like I normally did. The result was that my teeth felt smoother then ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case that comes with it makes it so I can just carry in my pocket all the time. It makes it really easy to clean my teeth right after eating. The case had a little pen-like clip on it but that broke off on the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far its been a week and I have only used about 3/4 of an inch of the stick. The whole length is about 5 inches. I expect it to last about a month before I need to open the next one. I have been using it about 5-7 times a day. Basically when I wake up, finish eating, after drinking a soda, and right before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone out there.</li>
    <li> the service and product are great. the miswak is strong in flavor and may take some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;company seems to have the best deal.</li>
    <li> Like them. Good material and gift item.</li>
