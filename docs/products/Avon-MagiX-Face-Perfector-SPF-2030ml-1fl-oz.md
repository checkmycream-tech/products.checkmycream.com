<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product arrived in a timely manner so the vendor is prompt with shipping and reliable. The actual product on the other hand I am unimpressed with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon squeezing a bit out of the tube, it immediately reminded me of one of those beeswax solid perfumes that you rub onto your wrist pulse points. The scent was overwhelming. I doesn&#x60;t smell bad, but rather like an amalgamation of baby powder and strong flowery perfume. I rubbed a bit on my clean face and although it has that definite silicone slip texture it leaves the skin feeling slightly greasy. I suspect this is because of the spf. If this product was marketed specifically as a lightweight face sunscreen, it would be a suitable and even preferable alternative to heavy sunscreen cremes, but it is sold as a &amp;#34;face perfector&amp;#34; which implies that it has pore minimizing/skin texture evening qualities, which it really doesn&#x60;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other &amp;#34;skin perfectors&amp;#34; out there that do a better job at minimizing pores and evening out skin tone for the same amount of money if you factor in shipping and handling costs that don&#x60;t have any annoying fragrance in them. ( Clinique pore minimizer being one of them, which has a silky, powdery feel instead of a slippery grease slick feel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After experiencing that awful whiff of cheap perfume every time I turned my head, hours later I knew i&#x60;d never use it again. Honestly this is one of the MOST heavily scented cosmetic products I have ever rubbed on my face.&lt;br /&gt;For people who are sensitive to synthetic fragrances, I would advise staying away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;For those that are not, and just want a lightweight sunscreen for the face, this might be a  good addition to your skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps...</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected!  I have oily skin and this helps with 90% of that problem.  Makeup goes on over top of Face Perfector eaisly.  Most importantly is having some extra SPF coverage all year round!  Delivered promptly!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use L&#x27;oreal True Match Liquid Make-Up and while I love it&#x27;s buildable coverage and all the color options that allow me to find a perfect match to my tone... it doesn&#x27;t last very long, even when I set it with powder. So, I was browsing through my co-worker&#x27;s Avon catalog and this just called out to me. It seemed so lovely, promised much and was on special for like $5! I bought it, and fell in love with the cute little tube. Squeezed it out, and rubbed it on my face. Felt a bit grainy,but also smooth,and i thought \\&quot;Heck, it&#x27;s exfoliating me too\\&quot;. My face felt baby smooth, though I didn&#x27;t notice much evening out of my skintone. Then again, that&#x27;s what foundation is for. I applied my make-up, it went on smoothly, though after it looked a bit cakey-er than usual. I used my setting spray, and it mostly fixed it, but something still looked off (grainy?) Whatever. A few hours pass, and it&#x27;s like I never wore any primer. My make-up is fading out same as always. Gave it another try afterwards, using more primer. This time my make-up did last a little more, but it always looked grainy, despite my smoothing/buffing and setting spray. Overall, this product promised me much, and delivered little. In the end, I only kept it for the SPF.</li>
    <li> I love Avon products! Great price! Fast delivery!! Is as disscribed!!Thanks</li>
    <li> I did not  see anything change on my face when I used this product! I don&#x27;t get all the positive responses, only reason I bought. So Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a while and I love the results.  I have very oily skin and this perfector seems to control it and minimize the shine on my face.  I usually wear this and some lip gloss and i&#x27;m ready to go.  :)</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product. It did not do anything it states it is supposed to do. I am an older woman and just wanted a product to even out my skin tone. This doesn&#x27;t cut it!!!</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin.  I mean from the time I put on my foundation until exactly 1 hour later my t-zone is oily.  It has been several hours and my chin and nose are still pretty non oily.  I have never found anything that will do the job.  I will be ordering a few more so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> OOOOHHHH MMMMYYYYY GGOOOOODNNNEEESSSS!!! I am so pleased with this product. I have read about primer under your foundation for a while but finally decided to buy this since my mom sells AVON. Anyway, it is a light feeling product and when you put it on it is virtually invisible but when you put your foundation over it....it really is like MAGIC!!! I have ridiculously oily, mild acne prone skin. There is usually about 2-4 days in the month where I do not have any raised pimples or comedones but I still have acne scars all the time. So i used this product when I am going out or may have to take pictures and it made my skin (along with liquid foundation) appear smooth and had an even complexion. I will be purchasing again but from AVON directly, only because my mom will kill me if I do not patronize her business!! :)</li>
    <li> I never really paid attention to SPF, but I felt that I should, so that is why I chose to buy this product because I was looking to buy into some sort of \\&quot;base/primer\\&quot; for the summer. Hasn&#x27;t broke me out or anything, but does truly blend very well. I feel that the fragrance (its very nice) causes irritation for my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many face primers.  This is the best one so far. I can see a real difference with pore size(smaller looking) once this is applied. The product feels silky on the face. I use it with makeup, but it can be worn alone.</li>
    <li> I wish I found this stuff sooner! It&#x27;s amazing! I have been using it as a primer mainly, and it makes my make up last so much longer then without it. I wish I found this sooner, because I am a nursing student, and this would have been great for days I was at the hospital all day without make up. It makes my skin appear clearer and my pores smaller! I would recommend it to anyone! My ONLY compliant is that the tube is small! But still totally worth it! AND affordable!</li>
    <li> Avon&#x27;s MagiX is perfect for minimizing pores and smoothing your face for whatever makeup you want to put on. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now. Plus the SPF20 protects the skin from sun damage. I have very fair skin and need that. Amazon&#x27;s shipping got it too me in no time at all. Thanks Amazon for making it available!</li>
    <li> Magix works better for my oily skin than the many more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> this is overrated...i was thrilled after reading the reviews and seeing the price but i dont really like this product. I was using M. Asam Perfect Teint (at HSN) that stuff is amazing but pricey...but after trying this the pricier ones are definitely worth it. I&#x27;ll go back to M. Asam or Olay&#x27;s filling+sealing wrinkle treatment..dont have wrinkles but makes a great primer!</li>
    <li> its ok it does make a difference but it is smooth and if u have good skin it will make it better but if u have bad skin u canot use it ass foudation defently use it on the bottom of faundation but not a miracle worker ass some  other reviews make it see its really cheap  even though shipping and handling is off the roof over $5. dollars in shipping fees i would say give it a try for ur self i would not buy again unless i bough from a avon rep. that does not  charge shipping and handling</li>
    <li> I tried this out on the promo deal. Usually I don&#x27;t buy avon stuff because it always feels cheap, but this stuff is WONDERFUL. I use it every day to smooth out my skin. I have oily skin, \\&quot;t-zone\\&quot; so it&#x27;s always hard to find something that will neutralize the oil and moisturize the dry areas. This does a perfect job and I wear it everyday even if I don&#x27;t put any foundation over it. Makes my skin happy!</li>
    <li> When I wear this I get compliments on my complection. I forget I even have it on. Nice and soft feels like a powder</li>
    <li> by it self, i do not notice much of a change, but it makes make-up go on silky smooth!!! huge difference!! and i makes it last all day!! smells great, and does not break out my semi-sensative skin!  i really enjoy it! great value!!</li>
    <li> After trying the tinted MagiX I was hoping this would work just as well plus I was looking for a way to escape the slight odor from the tinted stuff. No such luck. This product breaks me out so badly. I can feel my skin burning as soon as I put it on which never happened before. It also smells just like the other. I can kinda live with the smell and even the breakouts if the product actually worked but it really doesnt. It did make my skin feel nice but left my hands feeling disgusting and I saw no visable changes in the size of my pores or the way my makeup applied on top of it. I guess this product could work for someone but I dont think I&#x27;ll be using it very often.</li>
    <li> This works okay, I bought it help cover some redness on my face, it goes on smooth but for a few minutes it has a terrible smell that I find bad enough to almost not use it. It helped a little to cover the redness but could have been better. It worked well on minimizing pores on my nose so I was happy with that. If your buying this to shrink your pores go for it, but if you want it for redness its not going to do that much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I ordered this only because Reece Witherspoon endorses it.  Lame, I know, but still, I&#x27;m glad I did.  This primer is fantastic considering it is only 8 bucks.  My normal primer is Smashbox, but I have also used the Bare Minerals one.  Nothing is as good as the Smashbox one, but the Avon primer is just as good as the Bare Minerals.  It does give me smooth skin, and covers my pores.  It does not control oiliness too well though.  But for 8 bucks, go ahead and try it!</li>
    <li> Must start with a good primer &amp; makeup lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and easy to put on top coats, etc.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and was hoping that when using this product as a primer before makeup, my skin would appear less oily. The second I rubbed this product onto my face, my skin immediately become dry and flakey. It was almost impossible to put foundation on over the product, as it did not make my skin smooth and soft whatsover. This product made my skin imperfections more noticeable as well. Lastly, the tube this product comes in is shaped in a weird way that makes it hard to store the prodcut standing up. A flat lid would have fixed this problem. The only positive thing to note? The SPF 20 for protection from the sun. Avon makes a lot of great products, but this is not one of them.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS AVON MAGIX FACE PERFECTOR, IT KEEPS MY FACE SMOOTH, I HAVE OILY SKIN AND IT KEEPS AWAY THE SHINE, IT FEELS LIKE SILK, IT IS A KEEPER, I WILL BE ORDERING IT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE, DONNA</li>
    <li> I love this product but found myself out of it recently and decided to try L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Studio Secrets Face Perfecting Base.  Although it goes on super velvet and starts out doing the exact same thing as MagiX I found that it did not banish the shine for more than 2 hours after I applied it.  I generally wear the product alone without foundation or powder simply because I like the more natural look.  MagiX banishes shine and even though I&#x27;m African American the SPF included is a PLUS.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> This absorbs all the oil on your face and leaves skin baby soft and smelling amazing! this is a must have!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love or hate this item.  I didn&#x27;t notice any extreme changes in my skin for the positive or negative.  I will say it seems thicker than other primers I have used and I didn&#x27;t love the way it felt when I put it on.  I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;A magical new air-light colorless formula that makes all skin tones look flawless? invisible coverage. instant perfection. SPF 20. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, let&#x27;s be honest here.  If your skin is imperfect this product will not make it perfect.  It will not cover acne or scarring nor will it melt away wrinkles and laugh lines.  That&#x27;s just crazy talk.  It says right there that it&#x27;s \\&quot;colorless\\&quot; and it is.  Invisible coverage?  Really, I think that says it all.  If you have things to hide you need a good foundation/concealer, for wrinkles well there isn&#x27;t much anyone can do about them.  Now that I&#x27;ve got that out of the way, here&#x27;s what it will do.  It will provide a smooth base for your makeup, keep oil at bay for a wee bit longer than usual (not all day on me), and will prevent future sun damage by covering you with a good SPF.  Personally, I find that my concealer and mineral foundation looks more \\&quot;perfected\\&quot; and smoother when I&#x27;m wearing this underneath.  Is it magick or is it all in my head?  Who knows! I love it, I&#x27;ll continue buying it.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced, doesn&#x27;t break out my acne prone skin, nor does it dry it out and it is easy to find.  The package could use a tweak but that&#x27;s my only complaint.  I&#x27;ve used Smashbox and Bare Minerals primers and loved them but this one is just as good and costs less and the sun screen is what closes the deal for me.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste.  First off the smell is awful, almost like gasoline.  It takes a huge amount of product to get any amount of coverage and it feels heavy on the skin as well.  After applying this as a base under my makeup my eyeliner and brow pencil just would not apply right, almost like putting makeup on wet skin.  I love avon products but I would not waste my money on this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is not greasy---it is actually a matte finish and protects skin from sunburn, leaves skin looking good, and works without make-up, a \\&quot;must\\&quot; on really hot days.</li>
    <li> Thank you all for the wonderful reviews of the Avon Magix Face Perfector.   I have oily skin which breaks out easily so I am weary of all products. This product however proved to be amazing. After 2 weeks of daily use, i have no break out and no oil on my face. I use it in the morning and apply a tinted pressed powder on top. Don&#x27;t need to touch up through out the day. So convenient. I did notice a distinct smell in the cream. It did go away a couple of minutes after application.   Pros:  1. Perfect primer  2. Good quality  3. Non greasy  Cons:  1. Strange smell of the product (It disappears in a couple of minutes)  Overall a great product at an awesome price.</li>
    <li> It hides pores effectively and gives my face a smooth youthful complexion.  It is very gentle and non-greasy and even in the middle of summer, it is very comfortable.  It covers my oily T-zone for practically the whole day.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Pleased with this product. Helps decrease pore size. Good face primer before foundation/ mineral powder.</li>
    <li> Before trying this product I thought you had to spend a lot of money to get a decent primer, but boy was I wrong, this product is amazing! I simply cannot put on my makeup without it. I have extremely oily skin, and within 20-30 mins of me applying my foundation my face is already shining like an oil slick. Lucky for me, I found this little gem of a product and now i&#x27;m not nearly as shiny. It gives my face an almost airbrushed look, which I love, when I use it under my foundation. If you&#x27;ve got oily skin then this product is for you, not only does my foundation last longer, but it looks better too. I am hooked and will be using this primer until the day that it&#x27;s discontinued, but with how well this primer works, i&#x27;m pretty sure that won&#x27;t be happening anytime soon.</li>
    <li> This works great in the T-Zone area.  For hiding large pores,  as well as creating a matte finish to the area. It dries to a consistency like a powder. I don&#x27;t use make-up on top,  so I don&#x27;t know how that would work out. But with this product,  I don&#x27;t need the make-up.</li>
    <li> I found this worked well until about an hour after when my eyes had a burning/stinging sensation above my lashes, it was a hot day and became unpleasant driving. I tried it at night but no problems.</li>
    <li> After reading so many reviewers say that they used less makeup because of this product, I wanted to try it.  For me, it did nothing.  I don&#x27;t have particularly oily skin, just some fine lines, a few old acne scars, and the occasional blemish.  This product didn&#x27;t do anything to hurt my skin, but I also didn&#x27;t see any improvement.  For me, it&#x27;s a sun screen, and nothing more.</li>
    <li> Excellent primer! Does a good job in keeping my face shine-free and oil-free for the entire day!Works SOOOOOOOO well, without the expensive price tag!</li>
    <li> I am a Pro MUA who is very particular about cosmetic ingredients in products I use. This amazing product has a good rating on sites that rate the safety of cosmetics. I absolutely love my Avon Primer because it has sun protection and also gives my face a smooth base before makeup. It arrived in good condition and will definitely purchase more from Sepco again. That is if its Prime and price is right. It was actually cheaper here than from my Avon Rep. Thank You.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on as a cream but ends up feeling more like a powder. I haven&#x27;t noticed any pore minimizing as some people have, but I don&#x27;t have large pores to begin with. Plus the fact that it has 20 SPF is good enough for me. It DOES seem to dry out my skin a little. So if you have very sensitive skin, this may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;I should say though, this was the very first \\&quot;pore perfector\\&quot; I&#x27;ve tried, so I have nothing to compare it too.&lt;br /&gt;But, it was fairly inexpensive, shipped quickly and works nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Yeah this product is way too drying and I saw no improvement in my skin tone after months of using it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> Best primer ever.  I only put powder on top and it looks flawless.</li>
    <li> What a waste. This product is supposed to go well under makeup. However, even after waiting a while after applying the \\&quot;Perfector,\\&quot; my makeup went on TERRIBLY. Just terrible. Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!!!  Makeup now looks flawless!!  Received in a very timely manner.  Have since ordered several more for my daughter and sisters!!!</li>
    <li> This avon product makes a wonderful primer.  It works especially well for mineral makeup. It provides a smoothing colorless base layer that helps with my sensitive combination skin.  It helps my makeup glide over both my dry patches &amp; my slightly oily ones with ease.  Also seems to help my base &amp; powder last longer (even on my nose).  This is especially good for me considering that I am an x-ray tech in a hospital.  I don&#x27;t the time to touch up my makeup (except during lunch).  Plus, when I have to go to surgery, the mask I have to wear tended to rub the base &amp; powder right off my nose.  Not so with the avon face perfector underneath my makeup.  It has a smooth &amp; creamy feel, but not oily.  It also helps my makeup to glide over my acne scars without accenting them.  I&#x27;m very glad I tried this.  Hope this is one product avon has in stock from now on.  I plan to buy another tube when this one runs out.  The tubes last a long time.  A little bit will cover your whole face nicely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used NARS makeup primer for years, but I decided to try this based on the reviews.  This keeps my oil in check and my skin stays matte longer than the NARS primer.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. It goes on like silk, and has an SPF 20.  And that would be enough to recommend it. But it does something to the appearance of your skin, your pores, the way light hits your face, that&#x27;s subtle but undeniable. It does not provide heavy coverage, or a creamy moisturizer feel. It&#x27;s somewhere between a light satiny powder and a touch of magic. I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This leaves your skin super soft, minimises pores and gives you a nice clean base for your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this alone and go without make-up and still see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 40 and I&#x27;ve tried alot of primers, this one has an SPF as well so it&#x27;s well worth trying.</li>
    <li> Avon MagiX Face Perfector is amazing! I love it!  Have used it for about 3 weeks now and it is amazing how smooth it makes my face.  The pores on and around my nose area appear smaller when I use MagiX. Wonderful product.  I highly recommend this if you want your make up to look smoother and your pores to appear smaller.</li>
    <li> This is the only primer I have ever tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others. In fact, I don&#x27;t know why I even purchased this, because I didn&#x27;t even know what a primer was supposed to do. I hated it at first. I didn&#x27;t understand how to get this to go on my face evenly because it&#x27;s not like a lotion and it seemed like I needed tons to cover my entire face because I couldn&#x27;t see where it was going.  While I liked the velvety feel of it, I felt like it made my face greasier (I tend to have very oily skin that switches between oily and combo depending on the season). I forgot about it for awhile, but decided to give it another try after several months. This time, I used it just on my forehead where my face showed the shine the most. It seemed to control the oil better than anything I had tried previously (not an all day shine control, but anything that keeps it at bay for more than 2 or 3 hours is a winner in my book) and I find that it lessens the look of the expression lines that have popped up the last few years. This is colorless, so it&#x27;s not going to correct tone or anything. I also use VERY little because I find if I use more than the tiniest amount, I get oily. I only use this for my forehead and don&#x27;t use any other makeup on that area so I can&#x27;t speak for its ability to make your makeup go on smoother or last longer, but for people looking to fill in fine lines and blur them a little and control some excess t zone oil, it&#x27;s about $10 and worth a shot. Mine has lasted me over a year of everyday use despite it being a small tube because of the way and the amount I use. I think it&#x27;s one of those trial and error products; just gotta find how it will work best for you. I plan on purchasing their illuminating one next to use as a highlighter for my cheeks and hope it performs like this one does.</li>
    <li> Hooray for Avon!  This base leaves my skin looking great and has never caused any blemishes or problems. I just put it on, brush on some mineral powder and go.  Very clean feel, very natural look.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I typically use higher end product and just tried this on a whim.  It works perfectly and makes my skin feel soft as can be.  I use it in a couple of ways, often I mix a little with tinted moisturizer. I also use it instead of powder over foundation.</li>
    <li> Made my skin really dry and made me breakout.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years &amp; I Absolutely LOVE what it does!!!!! I have Very OILY skin with Large Pores &amp; this makes my skin look almost Flawless! It&#x27;s a Matte finish so no shine &amp; covers fine lines, because my skin IS very oily I do need touch up later in the day if I am going somewhere, thru no fault of the product. The other Wonderful part is that it does not make me have acne break outs, blackheads or any sort of irritation or funky odor! I HIGHLY Recomend this &amp; talk about Affordable, there are other primers out there that I&#x27;ve paid Alot more money for!</li>
    <li> the magic face perfector is great to wear with or wihout make up.  you get a natural flawless look.  the colorless formula visibly smoothes the look of fine lines and pores and leaves skin silky soft.  and it virtually shine free for up to 10 hours.  a must try!</li>
    <li> I love this primer!  I have not had any smell issues (and I am a smell-o-phobic!) or any separation, maybe its the temperature of the rooms they are stored in that causes smell &amp; separation??  I only use face powder all over, no foundation, and this makes the powder not settle into the lines around my eyes (years of harsh rubbing from allergies!) but it sure lasts, and stays smooth looking for the majority of the day (from 6:30 am until about 5:30 pm)  It also does tag team with my eyeshadow primer, my eyeshadow last all day!  great!  now, if they could come out with a lip gloss primer....I love AVON, the products have come up tremendously, and the price is great!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a primer at all and I have never really used Avon makeup but the reviews made me want to try it!!  Soooooo glad I did!  I am 41 years old and it definitely prevents my foundation from settling in my fine lines and gives my complexion a very soft and youthful glow!!  Love the stuff and will buy again and again!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product under my makeup or alone.  It give a matte type finish to your face and prevents the oily appearance of skin. It also has SPF 20 so that you have a little protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> I never primed my face for my foundation before I got the Avon MagiX Face Perfector.  Now, I make a very strict point of using this amazing product!  I have very oily, pore-ridden skin, and when I put the lovely smelling cream to powder perfector, I barely have to touch up my face during the day!  Truely worth it, at such a modest price.</li>
    <li> I cannot be without this product. It does all it claims to do. I can wear this with or without foundation/ powder. Very light on the face as well. I noticed right away that my skin felt like velvet, the redness on my cheeks was neutralized and my pores were definately diminished!! Wonderful product and a fantastic value. I have had one tube for about a year now. You really don&#x27;t need alot to do the job. Highly recommend this product to anyone.[[ASIN:B001EDHAU0 Avon MagiX Face Perfector SPF 20]]</li>
    <li> This liquid powder is terrific for summer wear!  No grease or caking....you don&#x27;t even know you have it on...except for the lack of shine!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wear this without breaking out like crazy. It&#x27;s nice and soft on my face so I think it does smooth and reduce pore size, but it isn&#x27;t worth it if I have a bazillion pimples, now is it?</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. I am an Avon rep. I try everything before I sell it so I can tell my customers real results. I absolutely loved this product; it is creamy, yet, feels like powder. Skin feels so soft and looks instantly clearer. Even my kids told me that I look different when I applied it. I do recommend it for every skin.</li>
    <li> the best product from Avon that I used, in fact, my mother and I use it, is cheap and leaves the perfect skin!!! I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The price of the product went down a day or 2 after I placed the order. Since I hadn&#x27;t even received it yet, I thought it might be possible to get a price adjustment. I sent an e-mail asking about it. I still haven&#x27;t heard back. The product arrived. It&#x27;s not as great as people claim it is. I spent too much on a product that&#x27;s not so great. I feel ripped-off. I&#x27;m never ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and like it because it is clear yet covers many skin imperfections. When I use this, I don&#x27;t have to wear foundation or sunscreen.   The price from this supplier was good plus there was no shipping charge, which I also liked. Product arrived in good condition and within the delivery period.</li>
    <li> I thought this worked nicely, but my face broke up terribly after I used it.  I quit using it for a few days, my face cleared up, then tried it again.  My face broke out again.  I&#x27;m generally not very prone to skin reaction from products, but this one does not react well with my skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if u have sensitve skin.</li>
    <li> I will sum it up in one word Excellent!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product.  It does smooth nicely on my face and hide my pores.  My make-up or moisturizer goes on nicely with no residue.</li>
    <li> Love this product and am going to order more!!!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product and it did smooth out my skin texture. But it settled in my pores so that every pore that was filled in was like a white dot, and with my skin there are a lot of them! My foundation didn&#x27;t cover them, so I couldn&#x27;t wear this product out in public. If you have much better skin than I do it might work for you. Also, I broke out like crazy, but for me that&#x27;s almost any product so I can&#x27;t blame Avon for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I can&#x27;t attest to the longevity of foundation or other products worn on top of this since I didn&#x27;t make it out of the house with it on and ended up tossing it.</li>
    <li> I use this as a primer and it works pretty good, makes my skin feel smooth and my makeup stays on longer than when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I have tried tons of products, expensive and not.  This one is a definite keeper!  It goes on silky and what a difference it makes to smooth out my more wrinkly places!  I am thrilled with it!</li>
    <li> Sadly, this product does not contain any ingredients to screen out UV-A rays. There are enough to screen UV-B rays. UV-A screening is important to help prevent skin cancer and photoaging. Not recommended as a daily facial sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this and I&#x27;m really hoping it works because I have giant pores and really oily skin. I read all the good reviews on it so I&#x27;m really hoping this helps!!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff - stops shine either alone or under makeup, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause breakouts. I use this as my everyday SPF lotion - so glad to see it available here!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time. Great quality, good price. Works wonders. I use it instead of base.</li>
    <li> Such a great product for the price. I put it on after my mosuturizer, let it dry, then put on another primer by too faced. Keeps my makeup in place all day and I only have to use blotting paper one after about 4-6 hours - which is amazing for me because my tzone is VERY oily. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This product makes a film on your face and when you attempt to put foundation over it, it makes flakes on your face.  Tried it twice and it went into the garbage.</li>
    <li> Great product. Can wear alone, with powder, or foundation. Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I really like how it makes my skin feel.  As far as making my makeup last longer, I&#x27;m not convinced.  But it does make my tinted moisturizer or foundation easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you.  I&#x27;m a budget queen, especially in this recession.  I&#x27;m all for loyalty, but a product&#x27;s got to be GREAT for me to stick with it and buy it repeatedly.  This is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 41, have combination/oily skin which becomes an oil slick in the summer.  Finally a SMART primer.  Even though I am African-American, I&#x27;ve been wearing sunscreen daily in my moisturizer since my early 20s and having it \\&quot;sneaked\\&quot; into my primer is an added bonus for the days when all I need is a slick of lip gloss and a non-shiny complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays put, doesn&#x27;t give me an overly unnatural super-matte finish and controls shine beautifully.  I&#x27;ve got to give Avon a hi five on this one; I have a feeling other primers will be following suit shortly and combining theirs with SPF protection, too.  It should be the norm.  Smart product that works well!  Stock up, girls - stock up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I wish is that it were in a 2 oz. or even a 4 oz. tube.  With all the talk about going green and being responsible at least give us the option to buy more at a time without using all the extra plastic.</li>
    <li> This may be the perfect product for younger skin, but it was disappointing for me. I have clear, good skin but fine lines around the eyes (I&#x27;m 52), and I didn&#x27;t find that this product filled in those fine lines, as one other reviewer felt it did for her. It feels wonderful going on, and the sunscreen is a nice plus, but by the end of the day parts of my face feel dry.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s light, easy to apply and not greasy. I have combination skin and this perfect for under make up or alone.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product, you are really missing out.  It makes your skin feel like velvet and fills in small lines and imperfections disappear.  So in love!!!</li>
    <li> I have freckled skin that is impossible to put foundation on without looking hideous.  I found this while strolling through reviews and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I apply just a small amount over my moisturizer and my skin looks amazing.  It helps to cover my blackheads and make my skin look more even.  It also prevents my skin from getting oily, which is nice.  I&#x27;m buying this for Christmas for my mom, aunt, and pretty much every girl I know!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I ordered it back in October, and I am just now finishing up the bottle.  I use it just about everyday.  I put it on to create a nice matte surface before applying any foundation .  My foundations needs depend on the days&#x27; activities.  However, regardless if I am wearing a full coverage liquid, a sheer tinted moisturizer, or as with most days, a cream to powder foundation, it all feels better and last longer with this product underneath it.  It is such a great price even at full price when you compared it to even the cheapest type primers you can get at the drug stores.  I became an Avon Rep. just so I could make sure I could always get my hands on this product.  [...]</li>
    <li> i would recommend this product to anyone... it is great for making you look like you spend a lot of time on your makeup.  you can put it on with or without foundation and it will enhance your beauty,</li>
    <li> This came up on Amazon as recommended for me and I decided to try it.     I put this product on under my makeup and my makeup stays in place the entire day.  There is no shine that seeps through even though I work 8 hours per day in an office.  When I get home, there is no oil on my skin so it really does what it says that it will do.    I have been using Smashbox Photo Finish for an under makeup primer but it is very expensive ($35.00 at Sephora) and there is not much in the bottle. Also the Avon MagiX has an SPF 20 in it which the Smashbox does not.  So for the money, Avon MagiX at $8.00 is quite the better buy.      Also my skin looks poreless with the Avon product.  My skin looks poreless with the Smashbox as well, but again the price is so much more than the Avon product.      I highly recommend Avon MagiX if you want a flawless finish and if you want your makeup to last the day.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite face primers. I love it!</li>
    <li> Best  perfector I have ever found and will always purchase.</li>
    <li> OMG! THE BEST PRIMMER EVER!!!! OK well I have Mix type of Skin Oily on my T Zone and dry on my and Cheeks! THIS IS PERFECT BECOUSE IT IS NOT OILY AT ALL. Highly recommend for Mixed Skin Types. plus the SPF is a Huge Plus!!</li>
    <li> I keep forgetting to use it, but it really feels great. Every time I use sunblock, my face breaks out. With this, no problem! Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help my makeup from building up in my smile lines..</li>
    <li> I absolutely give this product hands down the best in priming the face before makeup, blurring your skin to hide imperfections or large pores and it keeps me shine free practically all day (which is most important to me) and I have very oily skin.  I know everyone would be different and all day for me would be 6-8 hours.  I&#x27;ve tried basically all high end primers that promise shine free results since I began wearing makeup 15-20 years ago because my oily skin was such an embarrassment to me. It was until my friend started selling Avon about 5 years ago that I discovered MagiX Face Protector for around $8!!!  Since then she&#x27;s stop selling, I ordered a couple times off Avon.com, but I absolutely hate shipping cost. I don&#x27;t know why it took to long for the switch to turn on in my head. Duh, Amazon sells practically everything. The price is fantastic, the product is incomparable and it has spf 20 included inside the product. Your going to wish you found MagiX Face Profector years ago!  (I always get so excited when I know&lt;br /&gt;someone/people are about to try something that I know they&#x27;ll love!)</li>
    <li> Liked the product but stopped using when I discovered it is tested on animals. Won&#x27;t use nor recommend until they do not test on animals</li>
    <li> Doing some here-and-there modeling with a photographer friend of mine, my skin has been beaten up with heavier-than-normal makeup lately. I am familiar with makeup, but only just now getting terribly into it, so I thought I&#x27;d give some tinted moisturizer a try.&lt;br /&gt;Straight out of the box, I put a dab on the back of my hand. It made the pores go bye-bye without masking the skin itself. It&#x27;s not heavy, greasy, clumpy, powdery- any of that stuff. It&#x27;s just a light, semi-sheer cover that feels silky and looks beautiful and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I bought two!!!</li>
    <li> The product is really soft when you put it on your face and it does help keep makeup on longer but I think it actually made my face dry. Or if my face was already dry and I used it, my face looked even more dry. It&#x27;s pretty thick so a little goes a long way and it looks great with eyeshadow, the reason I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars is because it dries out my face and I was hoping that it would do the opposite.</li>
    <li> When I tried to use the Avon Magix face perfector, it rolled up on my face in horrible strips, and would not smooth out.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face, reapplied the product, and it did the same thing. It had a stale odor, so I checked the expiration date on the bottom of the box, and found that date had been marked over with a black sharpie pen. On the bottom of the bottle, it was dated 2008!!Shame on you!!!! I expect you to send a replacement that is not expired, and a return postage paid label. I gave it one star, but it didn&#x27;t deserve any at all. It was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> this is a fabulous primer, but i do think it causes me to break out. But i do have acne prone skin, so lots of products cause the same problems. i still like it</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of money.  Maybe I was expecting too much when it says it is a face perfector but it did absolutely nothing for my skin.  It claims that it will make all skin tones look flawless, invisible coverage, instant perfection.  Those are some pretty strong claims and I knew it wouldn&#x27;t make me look like a model with perfect skin but I didn&#x27;t expect it to do nothing.  When I applied it, there was absolutely no change at all.  Save your money and try one of the new BB creams.  I just bought Maybelline&#x27;s BB cream and absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I am a skin product addict and have tried them all. This makes the skin flawless and I get compliments all the time. I am 53, but look much younger!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really do anything special for me, but Avon products usually don&#x27;t. I never been a fan of Avon, because of the strong perfume smell all their products have. I decided to give them a shot with this products (because it had good reviews) and again it didn&#x27;t amuse me. Nothing special. I will keep looking....</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Well, I WANT MY MONEY BACK! It goes on smoothly, but feels dry, and powdery. It did not make my makeup stay all day, nor did it control the shine. If anything this thing made my makeup concentrate on certain areas even after much blending. I would not recommend this product nor will I buy it again. I just purchased the Mally Perfect Prep Poreless Primer, and have high hopes for it. I&#x27;m sure anything will work better than this AVON product.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t really feel a difference with this product on. After a while, the formula started separating too and I&#x27;d end up squeezing out really oily and liquidy substance. Trying to shake the thing profusely is tedious.</li>
    <li> I usually use Urban Decay&#x27;s Pore Perfecting primer. But I am running low so I started looking for a good alternative. I like this product  for when I am out of my UD. My make-up stays on and doesn&#x27;t move through out the day. I put it on around 6am and I don&#x27;t take it off until around 8 to 10 pm. And it seriously hasn&#x27;t moved. It also makes my pores look smaller! However, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this is that it didn&#x27;t keep me completely shine free like the Urban Decay does. I only get a little shiny so I have to blot like once or twice. But other than that, good product and I will probably repurchase!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin with a long history of acne, and as a result my pores are gigantic. I&#x27;ve tried many, many, foundation primers over the years to control oil and fill in my pores so my foundation won&#x27;t pool in them but they have all either made me more oily, broken me out, or both. I&#x27;m talking dozens of primers both high end and low. This one is the only one that works for me. It really does help control oil, but more importantly it completely smooths out my huge pores and makes my foundation look flawless. I&#x27;ve always had bad skin and I can tell you that every single time I&#x27;ve received a compliment on my complexion, I have been using this product. It just doesn&#x27;t happen without it! The trick is to using the tiniest bit, smoothing it over the areas you need to prime, and letting it set for a few minutes before applying your foundation. I&#x27;m not the biggest Avon fan but this product is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin is on the oily side and this stuff works. I put it on after washing my face (over a light moisturizer if it&#x27;s a humid day) and I just love the powdery finish that isn&#x27;t too drying. It isn&#x27;t tinted, but it makes my skin look clearer like I have a little makeup on. It does it&#x27;s job at keeping the shine down. I will reorder.</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin that is also very acne prone and this works like a charm. I use it after my moisturizer, and I have noticed such a difference in my oil control and my makeup staying in place. It doesn&#x27;t irritate , glides on over my blemishes, and even hides some of my smaller flaws. The sunblock is a big bonus for me too since my skin is fair enough to freckle. I have seen lots of primers for way more money that don&#x27;t do half the job this little baby does. I highly recommend and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Love it, better than Smashbox, better than Roc.</li>
    <li> Great for hiding oily skin.  Gives a nice matte finish.</li>
    <li> I have VERY oily skin and this stuff does help reduce the oil throughout the day.  It is not a miracle product by any means, but I do notice a difference when I use it.</li>
    <li> This product was okay but not wonderful.  I was disappointed.  Bought &amp;#34;Skin Food BB Cream in Beige&amp;#34; and am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but it smells a bit &amp;#34;rancid&amp;#34;?  Not sure if that is what it is supposed to smell like. It was &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; in box.  If I do purchase again, I will go to the Avon store near me and smell it first.&lt;br /&gt;The product leaves my skin feeling very smooth, a bit slick and if it gets near my eyebrows it the pencil kind of slides off so I have to wipe it away from the area. It does help with oil control, but my favorite &amp;#34;was&amp;#34; YSL matte touche oil control, in clear, which was discontinued.</li>
    <li> Avon had this product on backorder for so long that I finally had to break down and purchase from a seller on Amazon. Although Avon has now changed the formula for this product, I still love it and use it every day. The old formula was thicker and &amp;#34;dryer&amp;#34; and the new formula is thinner and creamier and I don&#x27;t think works quite as well -- but it&#x27;s close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine for SHINE FREE:&lt;br /&gt;- all over face moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;- spot Avon Magix on the areas of my fact that normally get &amp;#34;shiney&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- remainder of makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does Magix do?&lt;br /&gt;Avon&#x27;s claim is that it is sunscreen. And it is although it has no odor that I&#x27;m aware of.&lt;br /&gt;What it really does is make a matte finish on your skin keeping it shine free! Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like anything when you put it on your skin. Has no color (they have pigmented varieties).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who doesn&#x27;t love that?</li>
    <li> I first tried this product out when I went to Vegas back in August. Anyone who goes to Vegas during this time knows the weather is always 100+ and I suffer from oily skin. I&#x27;ve tried every remedy in the book to avoid an oily face and this is the only product that actually works! When I looked back at all the pictures that were taken of my trip in Vegas, my face was completely shine-free in all the pictures! During the day, my face feels matte and stays grease-free!&lt;br /&gt;The product was also delivered to me on time. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this product again and again!</li>
    <li> This is the very first primer I&#x27;d ever tried...and after experimenting with other brands including Hard Candy, Revlon, and others, I will never use another primer. The product itself has a creamy consistency, and goes on smooth. I find that I have to tap it into my skin as opposed to rubbing it in. I also recommend giving it a few minutes to dry before applying foundation or concealer. I&#x27;ve yet to find anything that covers my pores and troublesome spots as well as this does. For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> On time and exactly what I imagined</li>
    <li> I recently had my skin change from dry to oily just as I was getting my first real career-related job that I felt required makeup every day! Without primers I was lucky if I could get all the makeup to last from 7 AM to 12 PM. I was a mess and I needed some serious help!  My aunt became an Avon representative and told me about this product, which she said could probably address my needs. I couple it with [[ASIN:B005BXKHZE Acne Free All Day Acne Control, Leave On Foam AM, 3 Oz.]]. When I use both of these products, my skin looks so much better than it did before!  The Face Perfector also does a pretty serviceable job of oil control on its own for $10, though I usually have to blot when I use it alone. When I use it with the AcneFree foam, I don&#x27;t need to blot, even if I have a 7:30 AM-4 PM day at work! :)  I also wanted to say that I think this may be a product better suited for your face as opposed to eyelids. This primer didn&#x27;t really help my oily eyelids, and neither did the Too-Face Shadow Insurance primer. I&#x27;d look for something like [[ASIN:B004DIUWAI e.l.f. Essentials Eyelid Primer (Nude) elf]], which worked amazingly for me yesterday and only cost me $1 at my Target store.  However, I&#x27;m still very happy with this product and will continue to buy it since it feels velvety on my skin and does help with oil! :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff an got it for less here.</li>
    <li> What would I do without this!? I apply this with the brush one drop on the brush for the right side of my face, then I use the brush on the other side with the second drop. This covers my skin in sunny Florida. My face doesn&#x27;t burn. It is wonderful sunblock, with a high enough SPF here in sunny sunny Florida!delivered in a timely fashion! Wonderful product! I was using smash and it cost 10 times as much. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice formula to put on under your makeup, especially if you have oily skin. It&#x27;s like a cream that turns into almost a powder when you rub it on but still stays kind of moist (if that makes sense). I like using it as kind of a primer when I&#x27;m wearing light foundation because it makes my skin feel lovely and has the spf in it to protect your skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best. Have tried many other face perfectors. Always come back to this</li>
    <li> If you are sixty and expect this will make you look twenty don&#x27;t buy it.  It gives your skin a really nice look and feel, I use it on top of my makeup.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this I ordered a more expensive product from one of those selling channels. In the end, when I found this product I compared the two and this one is way better. I even gave my friend a Magix and a little bit of the other product and she agrees that this one is better and of course cheaper! I ended up making my cousin buy one as well because she has a shiny complexion especially after putting on makeup. If you have oily skin or do not want your face to be shinny in pictures then get this product! A little really goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Nothing compares to this. I have sensitive skin that flares up pretty frequently, and this product gives me smooth, shine free skin. It prevents foundation or powder from settling in and is not irritating or heavy. It is inexpensive and the quality is great! It has SPF which is really important, no scent, and goes on completely clear. It stays on throughout the day even through sweat, but doesn&#x27;t clog pores. This is the best base for make-up to get rid of that all-day shine, and it can be used on it&#x27;s own to banish shine and UV rays as well. Use it under loose powder for a natural look, or under foundation for a more refined look. Most major brands claim to do what this ACTUALLY does, but this has been the only one to deliver. Despite what ANY other reviews say, I am 100% positive everyone will love this product, and it will improve your skin.</li>
    <li> Tried a couple other brands and came happily back to this one.  You can&#x27;t beat the price and it does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I just received this product yesterday. I shop online all the time but this is the first time I have ever left a review. I naturally have extremely oily skin; not just the average oily. Normally after 20 minutes of cleaning my face, my skin has so much oil that a tissue would not be enough to wipe it all off. My make up would be a disaster shortly after. I needed a great primer without spending too much money. When I came across this product, some of the reviews said it worked well but after a few hours they had to reapply. Well I honestly believe those reviewers just wanted an unrealistic product that would magically keep their skin dried out. I, on the other hand, just wanted to be able to give my boyfriend a hug without staining his shirt! I applied this product to my clean face before work at around 8:15am. It&#x27;s a cream but it dries on your skin like a powder. Through out the day I kept checking my skin like I normally do, expecting to wipe it clean but I didn&#x27;t have to. After 6:00pm my skin was not just exactly as dry as it was this morning but it was really close to it. I am so excited and cant wait to continue using this product. I felt like a normal person with normal skin for this first time since I can remember. The SPF is a plus here in south Florida.</li>
    <li> I so wanted to love this product. I saw soooo many positive reviews and was certain it would work for my sensitive, very oily skin. I didn&#x27;t hesitate to use it once I got it, I was so excited particularly because this primer has SPF, and I live in the Caribbean so SPF is my best friend. I put it on and I was so happy that it did not irritate my skin at all. However, for some reason it made me more oily. I usually use Milk of Magnesia as my primer, but wanted to try something that had SPF for added protection over my sunscreen. Unfortunately I do not need the extra help in the oily skin department. So I guess i&#x27;m back to my old primer. Just because it didn&#x27;t work for me, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t for you or it&#x27;s a bad product. I have really complex and oily skin.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy when I received this product and saw that it had \\&quot;matte\\&quot; in the description, but I changed my mind after application.  It is light, easily applied and the result, while matte-ish is also illuminating.  Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent more than a few dollars on primers and can compare this with others available for 3-5 times the price ([[ASIN:B004QBC43A Too Faced Cosmetics Primed and Poreless Spf 20, Bronze Tint, 1-Ounce]], [[ASIN:B007PCQ7PS Tarte Clean Slate Poreless 12-Hr Perfecting Primer 1 oz]], [[ASIN:B0017U10SI Bare Escentuals bareVitamins Prime Time 1 oz.]]). Here&#x27;s why i wont go back to the expensive options available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The product does as good, if not better, than the expensive ones i&#x27;ve used. In fact a couple of the expensive ones have a tendency to cake up and this one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have oily skin and this primer really does help with that. The expensive ones havent helped much. In fact, i use this primer without make-up when i am in a hurry because it keeps my skin oil free throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You really cant beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, a highly recommended product for everyone who wants the best product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
    <li> A little cakey but gives a nice smooth finish if you want to go without makeup.</li>
    <li> I have always been skeptical of purchasing Avon products but when a co-worker and dear friend became an Avon rep I decided to give the products a try more so to support her than anything else.  I purchased the MagicX cream because introductory price was only $7.50.  I figured what did I have to lose.  I must say that this is the BEST CREAM I HAVE EVER USED!!!!!  My skin is naturally oily and I have large pores but when I applied this product, the oil was GONE-INSTANTLY and my pores really do look smaller.  The best thing of all is that it lasts ALL DAY (no need to touch it up while at work, yaaay!) and I no longer need to wear any foundation at all.  I purchased a second tube right away to be sure I never run out.  I&#x27;m addicted.  The price is now $10 but still WORTH EVERY PENNY when compared to a similar cream I used to buy from Bliss Spa for $35.  Buy it, you will not be disappointed!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. Goes on silky, stays silky, make up application is smooth atop. Skin stays fresh w/o oil shine for hours. Hope Avon continues with this product!</li>
    <li> It makes the skin feel so good.</li>
    <li> I wear it under my foundation and it does make my makeup go on better. It also keeps me shine free throughout the day.</li>
    <li> i actually dont see the difference in my face when using this product, makes it smoother yes, but as far as being anything close to a primer, i dont find it useful.</li>
    <li> I got this because it had so many good reviews.. But I hate how it feels on my face while I&#x27;m putting it on. It&#x27;s soo oily. And then when it&#x27;s on it feels dry like nothing I guess. I dont know, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if your skin is sensitive.</li>
    <li> Works great, as described!</li>
    <li> My mom is an AVON rep and I heard great things from her about this product when it first came out, and how it was supposedly the new miracle product like AVON advertises all the time for their new products. She bought quite a bit of it, and used it all up, so this past year I decided to try it. The first thing I noticed was the satiny smooth feel. I initially loved it. But the next thing I noticed was the opposite of love. When applying my foundation after, it made my foundation look really weird and cakey/flaky. I had used this foundation for a long time with Rimmel primer, and had no problems. I figured maybe it was just that one foundation and the next time used a different foundation with the MagiX. I was yet again disappointed. It had nothing to do with the foundation. I&#x27;ve never really had problem skin, and MagiX made my skin have a problem with accepting liquid foundation. I unfortunately bought a few tubes of this after trying it the first time and liking it, and will never use it again. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this primer for close to six months, and I I absolutely love it.  It goes on great, and a little seems to go a long way!!  It is not at all greasy and leaves my sking feeing smooth.  My make-up seems to stay on much longer after using this product.  I hope Avon keeps making this!!</li>
    <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference using it under my foundation, as far as staying power goes, but I did like the way it made my skin feel after I first applied it. I read a review that it can be worn without foundation. Not so in my case. My complexion is much too uneven for that. My foundation did glide on a bit smoother though as I recall.</li>
    <li> Easy application and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> For the price it cannot be beat. Thanks Avon, It does what it promises.  And it last a long time.</li>
    <li> So far so good.....seems to make my face smoother looking longer. Goes on nice and a small amount spreads well. Good price for product.</li>
    <li> This was a great product, never tried Avon before and it turn out to be a wonderful product. And it didn&#x27;t cost very much either. It&#x27;s a face primer I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!  I don&#x27;t wear with any other make up.  I just like to take the shine off my face and this works wonderfully for that.</li>
    <li> I use liquid foundation and added this to my make up routine. My skin looks so much better now with my make up. My foundation lays on smoother and it makes my skin look amazing! I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I had nearly run out of primer that I bought from Sephora for far too much money.  So I checked here and carefully looked at the reviews, this seemed to hit all my requirements and then some:  it had to work, it did not need to be expensive, and it had to smell nice or at least not have a funny smell.  In addition, this has sun screen which is a sensible addition, why don&#x27;t they all do that?  The product works extremely well, just as well as any of the far pricier primers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever. It really makes your makeup glide on. It really works great. The price is great too.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this would work for me but it didn&#x27;t.  I was bummed. I went back to Smashbox.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this primer ...its wonderful makes my makeup just glide right on and last so much longer !!!thanks Avon</li>
    <li> Okay, it sure as heck smooths everything out - to an eerie complexion with an unnatural vibe.  It also clogs your pores like crazy and I had a major acne breakout after using this product.  I do not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister, who doesn&#x27;t wear any makeup and has quite a few wrinkles.  She loves it.  So do I.  I also wear it,  on those days when I don&#x27;t wear any makeup and need some SPF.  It makes a nice, soft, matte.</li>
    <li> I usually use Loreal&#x27;s Magic Perfecting Base. But, wanted to try something with more product since I was going through one $14 Loreal a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Avon Perfector is less &#x27;thick&#x27; than Loreal. This means I do need more makeup to get the coverage I want, but less of the primer makes it on to my applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Perfector is comprarble in oil coverage. And, doesn&#x27;t turn my African American dark skin ashy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think after a few hours it needs some retouching and can look a touch... yellow? But, overall am very happy and will switch to Perfector on a full time basis.</li>
    <li> I am used to using Smashbox photo primer but it was getting a bit expensive so i decided to try this out.  I noticed this products was a bit thick but it went on pretty smoothy.  Does the job and i save myself $20.</li>
    <li> The Avon MagiX Face Perfector SPF 20 provides a smooth and soft protection to the face.  Works very well at disguising large pores.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite product. It&#x27;s a great price, it&#x27;s very effective, and it glides on so smoothly. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Keeps shine at a minimum for oily skin.</li>
    <li> It makes my face look like porcelain. I use just a small amount and I don&#x27;t really notice much of a smell. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought the Avon Magix Face Perfector and L&#x27;oreal Base Magique at the same time but initially tried the Base Magique first. I was quite satisfied with Magique as it kept my oily skin (T-zone combo) relatively matte all day.  However, when I tried the Avon Magix Face Perfector primer, I was blown away as it concealed my pores better than Magique.  It does help make make-up glide more smoothly and last longer.  I can wear the primer alone as well and still feel and look \\&quot;flawless\\&quot; (read: poreless).  I am 33 years old with very few wrinkles to begin with but my pores are huge! With the Face Perfector, the pores are barely noticeable. Oily skin on my forehead, nose and chin isn&#x27;t a problem when I&#x27;m wearing this primer!</li>
    <li> I saw no magic on this one.  I wanted it to work because of all the hype of this product but it did not do much.  Yes it feels like a nice primer but there were bits of sparklyness which I didn&#x27;t get.  I now use the body shop&#x27;s vitamin c booster which I feel is magic.  Price is much higher but I feel it was worth it.  This product just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  Price is good so you might as well give a try!</li>
    <li> I bought this primer in hopes that it would tame my oily skin and help my foundation last longer. It does neither! I do like the powdery feel it gives my skin, and it has SPF in it, but besides that I consider it a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not a good primer at least for me because my face tends to get a bit oily throughout the day, I bought this in hopes that it would help keep that under control, but alas it failed.</li>
    <li> As good as a designer brand that was costing me twice the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels like it has something abrasive in it. It kind of hurts to put it on. I have sensitive skin and this is not compatible. I prefer I&#x27;oreal Studio Effects Professional much more, which can still be found in drugstores I believe. It leaves my skin soft and I see a visible difference.</li>
    <li> I had seen a commercial recently for a Spot Corrector and decided my skin needed a product like this.  I did some research and realized that Avon MagiX got great reviews and was very reasonably priced as opposed to other options.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I just tried it the first time and LOVE it.  I can&#x27;t understand how it does what it does, but the directions say it is a gel in a tube that turns to powder.  It really does just that.  It left my skin with this clean looking finish, not greasy and does not have shiny minerals (which I hate).  Just makes it look really smooth and polished.</li>
    <li> What was I thinking.  I bought this to smooth out the appearance of my face.  It has a chalky consistency and made me look like a ghost.</li>
    <li> I started using this hoping that it would make my face less greasy and help my makeup last longer.  It is honestly hard to tell if it has help.  It does have some sunscreen in there as well so I have kept using it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I tend to go for a pin up look, so my skin needs to look flawless and this does that. It gives a great matte look and leaves my skin smooth and clear, even without make up.</li>
    <li> I received the Magix Illuminating Face Perfector, because this product is currently out of stock.. sigh &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--I would have waited for the product i was supposed to receive.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few other primers, some more expensive, and for the money, the MagiX Face Perfector does a good job of smoothing my skin, reducing the appearance of large pores - I could wear it alone on days when I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup, just to make my skin look better.  It definitely helps my makeup last, too - even in my 50&#x27;s I have oily skin and makeup tends to &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; by the end of the day without this.  I say give it a try!</li>
    <li> Great base for any make up style....I use a bare minerals type and the finish is really pretty. My daughter and I are both &amp;#34;addicted&amp;#34; to it.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this was the texture is very odd very dry. I was afraid that it would dry out my skin but it didn&#x27;t. I think it work fairly well for the price I really spf 20 in it.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve been having ALOT of different skin issues lately. I decided to take a chance on this product. I&#x27;ve never been a big believer in AVON. BUT, this product actually really did help my complexion so far. My pores on my nose were SO visible and after using this today I can hardly tell they are there.</li>
    <li> feels like silicone on my skin!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It feels wonderful on my skin, like cashmere or something,. And it&#x27;s cheaper than other brands. I will buy again. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous primers and this is a notch abover the others. It is reasonably priced and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - works much better than any expensive product I&#x27;ve bought.  This blurs any imperfections, and leaves a wonderful matte finish for any other makeup applications you are doing.  I usually only use the Magix, but I&#x27;m sure you could put a foundation over it if you wanted to.  I do have oily skin, so if your skin is dry, I&#x27;m not sure how it would for you.</li>
    <li> I use this ALL. THE. TIME. I have OK skin now meaning I don&#x27;t really break out anymore but I do have acne scars on my face. This stuff covers them up and goes on nice and smooth. It also helps keep my skin moisturized. I like that it has the SPF in it so I don&#x27;t have to worry during the summer time about my skin getting sun burnt.</li>
    <li> Love this face perfector, I don&#x27;t have to wear foundation, goes on smooth and lasts all day, great price</li>
    <li> black girl..with medium dark skin...if that made sense...Sanaa Lathan shade....works well n this lil baby goes along way. does well with or without make up...make a cheap (beauty supply) make up looks like expensive stuff like Mac or sephora products</li>
    <li> I love this because it&#x27;s silky, creamy and smooth, and I use as a moisturized and SPF, before I apply foundation. Even on the days where I don&#x27;t use foundation, I&#x27;ll throw this on for the psychology of having a face perfector. But honestly? It doesn&#x27;t perfect anything. It&#x27;s not a concealer and doesn&#x27;t even out tone.</li>
    <li> It helps me be less oily throughout the day. I have used it for years and have always been happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I have a good compIexion and don&#x27;t wear much make up, so I was happy when I found this.  Goes on light and helps smooth out the appearance of tiny lines.</li>
    <li> Great service and fair pricing!</li>
    <li> So I wanted to write a review for this product the day after I used it, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to learn about it&#x27;s full ability to protect and keep my skin looking smooth. When I first used it, I thought that the texture of the \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; or \\&quot;cream\\&quot; was very odd... This product is not wet like the primer I&#x27;m used to, which is Urban Decay&#x27;s Complexion Primer. When you roll it around in your fingers it get powdery and it disappears into a slick film on your fingers. I suppose this is the \\&quot;MAGIC\\&quot; in the \\&quot;MagiX\\&quot; part of this product. At first, I doubted it&#x27;s ability to really glide on my skin, so I used A LOT the first time. TOTAL mistake. I must note that the first time you open it, there is a bunch of oil that collects at the bottom of the tube. I almost believed that that was the primer! OIL? I was horrified. Dispose and dismiss this substance. I mixed in this oil with my first application. I broke out on parts of my face that isn&#x27;t the NORMAL part I would breakout. I almost gave up on it, but I am extremely picky about wasting money. So I used it again the next time. This time, I used a little less. It worked wonderfully! However, the true extent of it&#x27;s effectiveness can be tested in harsher conditions. I am an Import Model and yesterday I had to work at a car show. I was walking around outdoors all day. The beaming sun can make someone quite uncomfortable, as I had to worry about the amount of sweat dripping on my face. Throughout the entire day my liquid foundation (I use MAC Liquid Fix) stayed on and the only \\&quot;touch-ups\\&quot; were to add powder my nose. I must say, however, that it didn&#x27;t stay as smooth on my face near the end of my 8-hour day as my more pricey Urban Decay brand, but it held up to my expectations for most of the day. I&#x27;m really glad I bought the primer. I will not say I&#x27;m in love. I can definitely buy this again, but I will continue on my search for a new and cost-efficient primer.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t thrilled with how this perfector felt on my face after a couple of hours after application.</li>
    <li> I live in where the weather is always hot and with my very oily skin I have to use face blotters throughout the day.  My make up no matter what type whether oil free or specially formulated for oily skin made no difference.  I tried Mac primer but was disappointed.  Went for the good old Avon Magix fix perfect which cost 1/3 of the Mac price, and  It has cut down on the oil and blotting considerably and holds my make up well.  Tip:  put on your face cream /moisturizer and wait for about 3 mins , then put on the primer, them wait another 3 mins for it to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;, then go ahead with your foundation etc.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and this primer works great. It goes on smooth and silky and is wonderful under makeup</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is not oily and I use it as a sunscreen.  When you first apply this product it has a powdery feel but does not look powdery....your skin just looks non-oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would be fantastic as a sunscreen for those that do not wear makeup.  Nobody likes that oily gunky look that normally occurs with regular facial sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it under my makeup and it does seem to make my face look a little better.  Not a miracle, just a little better.  So, don&#x27;t expect miracles...expect to look in the mirror and wonder if you can tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that I can wear it with my oily skin and at the same time use it as a sunscreen.  It makes my face look a little better but, because of the sunscreen, will stop sun damage from making my face look a lot worse in the future.  That alone is worth it.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this product. I did not like it at all. It did keep my t-zone oil free but it sinks into your pores-it looks weird by the end of the day. If you have dry skin, this is not for you. I borrowed my daughters ELF primer and liked it much better. It kept my skin oil free without making it so dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this n my makeup stays on all day and my skin is much softer after a weeks use. I love this stuff</li>
    <li> I love this be use of the SPF, ad it&#x27;s not greasy. I use this under my makeup. It makes my&lt;br /&gt;Pores look smaller. I love this and it&#x27;s cheaper on Avon.com</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff for using under my makeup.</li>
    <li> I like the Avon MagiX Face Perfector. It leaves my face feeling soft and makes me feel protected since it has SPF 15. The only thing is that it made my forehead break out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the matte effect on my face which I was expecting but it does allow me to wear my makeup longer without looking too oily. However it does not prevent the &#x27;oily look&#x27; for as long as I thought it would. Lasts about 4 hours but does not work for all day wear.</li>
    <li> This primer really smooths out my face and includes SPF, so it saves me a step in my routine.  Like the way it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This product is the best!! Fills in imperfections! Plus it&#x27;s a sunscreen. Wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it!  Have tried several other products.....nothing beats this!!</li>
    <li> i liked the consistency of the product but it was a little dull for my likings (color wise) so i mixed it with a primer and a color correcting primer which helps fight against the redness in my skin.</li>
    <li> Its nothing special. Smooth finish but it doesn&#x27;t help with wear really and I felt it irritated my face</li>
    <li> I surely hope that Avon doesn&#x27;t discontinue this product.  I love it!!!!  It is a wonderful make-up primer because it makes your skin-tone look more even, your pores appear smaller and it has SPF 20.  Also, I have oily and sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in any way.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent primer.  I use it over sunscreen in lieu of makeup, and it leaves me with a beautiful, silky finish.  It doesn&#x27;t have parabens or pthlalates in it, which is super nice (I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if it did).  I like it more than the Smashbox primers, and it is a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> Really great stuff! I have extremely oily skin but this product keeps the oil at bay. I use it without foundation. I am of dark complexion and this product as no coloration what so ever.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I haven&#x27;t use it that much because i am not that of a make up person but i got it because i wanted to try what my friend were telling me to get and it&#x27;s true this is a great product that gives you a flawless skin when using it. Try it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so nice.  It helps even out skin tone, and keeps oily shine at bay.  Use this alone or under your foundation.</li>
    <li> Porcelain face. enough said! try this product, you will not be disappointed. my face was soft and smooth all day long and my pores minimized.</li>
    <li> I used to sell avon, I tried all my products so i would know what I was selling to my customers ... this was AWFUL!!! Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it.. Maybe I am missing the point but it was like at thick paste! almost like a baking soda poultrice! it was dry and nasty it did not go on smoothly or give a good surface for my makeup. I ended up washing it all off and just reapplied my make up as usual... Idk if it would help to mix with a moisturizer i just don&#x27;t think this product is anything you would want under your foundation... its like doing a terrible spackling job then painting over it.. it just makes things more noticeable</li>
    <li> fast delivery and it was just what I wanted. no complaints</li>
    <li> Only thing I can say it actually make your make up last. I put my make up around 7pm and came home at 3am. Just couldn&#x27;t believe it lasted as long and I have really oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. This product greatly absorbs the oil I have around my T-zone. It feels like powder once rubbed in. It is also very light weight. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried other face primers but I always return to Avon&#x27;s MagiX face perfector.  It keeps the shine down during the day and helps makeup to stay put.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have used tons of Avon products for years because they work so well and they are very reasonably priced so I decided to give this a try.  I have what I like to call \\&quot;bi-polar skin.\\&quot;  It just doesn&#x27;t know what it wants to do.  I am 36 so I like to use age preventatives and have a hard time finding good ones because most products do not agree with me.  Either too dry, oily, greasy, etc.  I have oily places on my face and then areas so dry the skin flakes.  I used this product the first time by itself and then put my make-up over it.  It has a lotion appearance but goes on with a powdery-like finish.  It was great in the oily areas preventing my face from getting shiny &amp; oily ALL day but the dry areas were still super dry.  The next day, I used my regular Anew Rejuvenate Day moisturizer (which is the BEST I have found for my skin type/s) and then put on the Magix as soon as it absorbed and then applied my make-up.  This worked perfect with the exception of a couple of super oily areas.  I now just avoid putting the moisturizer on those couple of spots (since Magix has SPF 20 also &amp; I&#x27;m still protected) and then put the Magix all over followed by make-up.  It is fantastic!! Honestly, it really gives you a little sheer coverage too so you don&#x27;t need much base or foundation for those who use it.  I use mineral powder and now use less due to the colorless coverage from Magix.  Great stuff!!  I just hope they never discontinue it as Avon often does!</li>
    <li> The face perfector came in the mail really quick. I really like product. I&#x27;ve been without it for almost two years now, and I&#x27;m not sure why I didn&#x27;t buy another one when I was finished with my previous one, but this is a great product. It does wonder to your face.</li>
    <li> I love the facial primer. I apply eye cream and moisturizer on my face, and lastly this wonderful primer. It leaves my skin smooth and soft. Now I don&#x27;t even use a foundation everyday. I just apply powder, a little blush and ready to go. Plus it has SPF 20 sunscreen which is always great to have.</li>
    <li> I just think that the Avon MagiX Face Perfector is just okay as it seem to settled in the creases around my mouth and I had to wipe it off that area.</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin. It blends in easily but leaves your face super smooth. I love using this in the summer. I like this one more than the similar product that is SPF15.</li>
    <li> I go back to this primer again and again.  Creates smooth finish and can wear alone without make-up.  Great product</li>
    <li> For the price this primer is the best you can get.  Too bad Avon stopped selling it.  So glad I can find it here.  It really works just as well as the $30 primers.</li>
    <li> Shipped extremely fast. Item as described.</li>
    <li> Great way to start your make-up regiment. I can see a difference in my skin I&#x27;ve always been really lazy when it comes to putting SPF but this makes it easy in one step it applies and feels light my skin doesn&#x27;t cakey or heavy</li>
    <li> This takes all the shine from my skin and hides my pores so that my foundation looks flawless. Perfect matte finish without feeling too dry or too greasy. For the record, I have combination fair skin.</li>
    <li> Like this product. Purchased before from independent dealer. Price was fair and it was sold out on line.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Avon products and this really works as it says it does!! I am so glad that i chose this while looking for a new primer, I have used a primer/perfecter by Philosophy for years now , but I can no longer afford it. But this works just like the Philosophy primer, and at such a great price you cannot pass this up!!</li>
    <li> I like that it has SPF but I&#x27;m a primer junkie and own lots. This one is only okay. It has a tendency to sit on the skin and ball up instead of absorbing. I tend to mix it with other primers otherwise it won&#x27;t absorb. Still, good value for the price. Better than many drugstore brands (I own Revlon photoready and L&#x27;Oreal Lumi and it&#x27;s better than both of them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My alternative suggestion: monistat anti chafing gel. It&#x27;s identical to a silicone primer. Very cheap. Better than this.</li>
    <li> This product was great while it lasted. It was perhaps a little more shiny (you could even say sparkly) than I would have wanted, but I&#x27;d cut it with my regular facial moisturizer, and they worked very well together. The consistency of this product was good - I was able to smooth it onto my face very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was the size and design of this tube. I knew I was buying only a small amount of the product, but I&#x27;ve bought tubes of the same size and been able to squeeze out more of the product. A lot of the product is stuck in the tube with no way for me to reach it.</li>
