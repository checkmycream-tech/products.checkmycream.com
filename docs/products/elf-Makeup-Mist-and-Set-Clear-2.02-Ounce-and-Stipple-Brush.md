      <li>The brush&#x27;s design is good and provides excellent coverage.</li>
      <li>brushes have proved great, but this one is terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 4/5 for the mist.</li>

      <li>The mist is very nice.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the mist, it works great and perfectly sets your makeup.</li>
      <li>The stipple brush is also amazing!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s best if you buy a most bottle or just replace the cap with another mist bottle if you have any.</li>
      <li>It also feels really nice too!</li>
      <li>A couple of pumps and you should be good.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll repurchase this for sure - soon!</li>
      <li>besides this I&#x27;m really loving this product ! :-)</li>
      <li>OK, these brushes are great, but I also love the mist.  </li>
      <li>Nice price</li>
      <li>I have never used that kind of product before</li>
      <li>I guess I picked a great product because I have seen several reviews that say this is the best one around.  </li>
      <li>The mist is a great inexpensive alternative for setting makeup beautifully although it doesn&#x27;t necessarily increase the wear time.</li>
      <li>The mist is nice (though it&#x27;s more of a spray than a mist), refreshing, and helps take off the powdery caked-up look from my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very smooth.</li>
      <li>The spray is a must have I absolutely love it</li>
      <li>I love using it whenever I use mineral foundation to set it and to avoid that powdery look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok don&#x27;t know if the spray is for my skin</li>
      <li>I am highly satisfied.  </li>
      <li>It has a bit of a scent that I would not describe as enjoyable, but it vanishes within seconds from spraying.</li>
      <li>Love brush.</li>
      <li>I was looking for both these products and was glad to find them packaged together.</li>
      <li>I use it for cream blush and liquid highlighter mostly.</li>
      <li>, I also love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a more type of oily skin</li>
      <li>The spray&#x27;s refreshing and smells nice-VERY light scent that goes away after application.</li>
      <li>I love E.F.L. because it is great makeup, especially when you are on a budget.</li>
      <li>It&#x27; as good as any high end products.</li>
      <li>The brush is a perfect little brush to use for blending.</li>
      <li>I do not have any complaints as I sprayed a light mist on each morning and it lasted all day.</li>
      <li>So I decided to get the mist and set spray, and since it was quite cheap including the brush, I decided to be apart of this</li>
      <li>the mist is great but the spray isn&#x27;t actually misting anything</li>
      <li>I love this mist, help set and keep my makeup fresh.</li>
      <li>The items arrive on time and securely wrapped.</li>
      <li>and it looks like I just put on makeup which is what I&#x27;ve been looking for at a cheap price.</li>
      <li>You will save a ton of money over the long haul, and you will look great doing it.</li>
      <li>I love finishing up my makeup with a light spritz and it really does help to keep my face fresh all day.</li>
      <li>I love the brush it works so well with applying foundation it makes it look natural.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly but didn&#x27;t like the brush and the spray didn&#x27;t really seem to set my makeup well.</li>
      <li>This really helps my makeup stay until I get out of school!</li>
      <li>I would of rated it higher if I got everything it said comes in the set</li>
      <li>I love the brush as it gives me more coverage than the small stipple brush.</li>
      <li>my foundation is pretty much gone.  </li>
      <li>Additionally, the brush is fabulous for even smooth, powder application (as good as the expensive sheer-application brushes)!</li>
      <li>The brush is super soft, and has not dropped any hairs.</li>
      <li>The stipple brush is ok, just not very dense -</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve tried other setting sprays which kept my skin from getting oily and set my makeup better.</li>
      <li>Again the brush is above average and better than others I have used.  </li>
      <li>So far this hasn&#x27;t changed how my makeup looks after 8hrs.  </li>
      <li>so far my makeup has been staying on and not melting off</li>
      <li>I said, original product, ver serious and responsible people.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend trying these products over committing to a more expensive brand; even as a makeup artist.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like their other big brush</li>

    <li> So far this hasn&#x27;t changed how my makeup looks after 8hrs.  My eye liner still runs and my foundation is pretty much gone.  So this stuff is unfortunately useless.</li>
    <li> OK, these brushes are great, but I also love the mist.  I have never used that kind of product before and I will never go back.  I think the product works great.  keeps makeup in place all day, I also love how it makes my skin feel.  I guess I picked a great product because I have seen several reviews that say this is the best one around.  I am highly satisfied.  Again the brush is above average and better than others I have used.  I use it to apply foundation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27; as good as any high end products. Love brush.</li>
    <li> The mist is very nice. But I did not get the brush they showed coming with this product. I would of rated it higher if I got everything it said comes in the set, it&#x27;s NOT a set!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok don&#x27;t know if the spray is for my skin</li>
    <li> The mist is a great inexpensive alternative for setting makeup beautifully although it doesn&#x27;t necessarily increase the wear time. Additionally, the brush is fabulous for even smooth, powder application (as good as the expensive sheer-application brushes)!</li>
    <li> Love how it feels in my skin!!</li>

    <li> I absolutely love the mist, it works great and perfectly sets your makeup. Never received the brush with my order though. :(</li>
    <li> I love the brush as it gives me more coverage than the small stipple brush. The mist works as well as the Sephora brand. I do not have any complaints as I sprayed a light mist on each morning and it lasted all day. The trick is not to over spray the mist. A couple of pumps and you should be good.</li>
    <li> Great to have.  Nice price</li>
    <li> I love E.F.L. because it is great makeup, especially when you are on a budget. The brush is super soft, and has not dropped any hairs. The setting spray works like a charm. Although these items are not top of the line, they work if you are not looking to spend a small fortune on cosmetics. I highly recommend trying these products over committing to a more expensive brand; even as a makeup artist. You will save a ton of money over the long haul, and you will look great doing it.</li>
    <li> the mist is great but the spray isn&#x27;t actually misting anything so it&#x27;s best if you buy a most bottle or just replace the cap with another mist bottle if you have any. so far my makeup has been staying on and not melting off and it looks like I just put on makeup which is what I&#x27;ve been looking for at a cheap price. hopefully elf can change the spray problem though. besides this I&#x27;m really loving this product ! :-)</li>
    <li> Original product and very serious people. There was a mistake and I didnt receive the stippler brush. i contacted them and the next day they sent it. after three days I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, original product, ver serious and responsible people.</li>
    <li> Work well I use it to set my foundation  in need of a refills well be buy this elf makeup once again</li>
    <li> Keeps my make-up in place for a little while wbut then it starts to make me look cakey. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin?</li>
    <li> I was looking for both these products and was glad to find them packaged together. The brush is great for aoplying foundation and blush. The spray&#x27;s refreshing and smells nice-VERY light scent that goes away after application.</li>
    <li> I brought this item, it did not stay, as suppose to do? I gave it 2. Stars because it did not give me rash.</li>
    <li> I love this mist, help set and keep my makeup fresh.</li>
    <li> I would always have to set my makeup during the day at school. I&#x27;m a more type of oily skin so it gets really annoying with my makeup slips right off my face. So I decided to get the mist and set spray, and since it was quite cheap including the brush, I decided to be apart of this deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I do about 3 sprays onto my face about an arms length away. This really helps my makeup stay until I get out of school! The stipple brush is also amazing! I don&#x27;t really like their other big brush (I&#x27;m not sure what it is called, but I used it for my foundation). The hairs would always fall off, overall not a good experience. So I didn&#x27;t think this brush would work well. So I used it for my powder and I LOVE IT! It is very smooth. A great starter brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this through extreme heat t and it kept all my makeup in place. I love using it whenever I use mineral foundation to set it and to avoid that powdery look. I just spray it 3 to 4 times from an arm length away after I&#x27;ve done all my makeup and it works wonders. It has a bit of a scent that I would not describe as enjoyable, but it vanishes within seconds from spraying. I&#x27;ll repurchase this for sure - soon! The stipple brush is ok, just not very dense - I use it for cream blush and liquid highlighter mostly.</li>
    <li> Perfect set of makeup brush and finishing spray. I love finishing up my makeup with a light spritz and it really does help to keep my face fresh all day. It also feels really nice too! The brush is a perfect little brush to use for blending.</li>
    <li> I love the brush it works so well with applying foundation it makes it look natural.  The spray is a must have I absolutely love it I wish I knew about setting sprays when I started wearing foundation.</li>
    <li> The brush is so stiff it hurts my face. Coverage is terrible. The spray bottle was covered in the mist, soaking wet. The mist  smelled like vomit. I used it once, and threw it away. My makeup didn&#x27;t stay any longer than expected. It also felt like I was wearing an elmers glue mask.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly but didn&#x27;t like the brush and the spray didn&#x27;t really seem to set my makeup well. I also have oily skin, that may be the reason but I&#x27;ve tried other setting sprays which kept my skin from getting oily and set my makeup better.</li>
    <li> The mist is nice (though it&#x27;s more of a spray than a mist), refreshing, and helps take off the powdery caked-up look from my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush left me very disappointed. It seemed to soak up the makeup, but not deposit it on my skin. If I powdered with another brush and decided to finish up with this one, it actually sucked away my makeup, and I had to reapply! Other e.l.f. brushes have proved great, but this one is terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 4/5 for the mist. 1/5 for the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That star being because&lt;br /&gt;1)it&#x27;s cheap&lt;br /&gt;2) amazon doesn&#x27;t let us rate items on a scale from 0-5</li>
