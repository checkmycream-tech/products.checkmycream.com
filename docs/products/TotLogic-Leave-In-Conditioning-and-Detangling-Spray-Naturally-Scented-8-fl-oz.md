      <li>After much searching, this product is the one we like the best.</li>
      <li>nice product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this safer option (rated 4 on EWG).</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work.</li>
      <li>I love this product and I am buying more.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>On top of all of this, her skin was not irritated.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!</li>
      <li>The scent was very light and clean smelling.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, and my granddaughters hair is shiny now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t work as a standalone conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine and curly and this has been a dream product.  </li>
      <li>and it is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Love this conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair - works really well to get the tangles out!</li>
      <li>I had zero stubborn knots when using this, and it left her hair incredibly soft and great smelling!</li>
      <li>Nice, light scent and totally natural.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because it is natural, it leaves my daughters hair soft and beautiful.</li>
      <li>It has no harsh chemicals and smells nice.</li>
      <li>For her thick hair, that was about 4 sprays and it worked beautifully!</li>
      <li>It sprayed evenly in a fairly light mist, and then I combed it through her freshly washed hair.</li>
      <li>And it has a pretty strong floral scent.</li>
      <li>Her hair never looks greasy and it has a clean fresh scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - smells nice and only lightly fragrant</li>
      <li>Maybe better for an older child.</li>
      <li>Good product for wet hair.</li>
      <li>This TotLogic leave in conditioner helped me find just the right balance and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my prenatal acne.  </li>
      <li>Brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair is now easy and it controls the friz, turning her natural curls into a silky, styled look.</li>
      <li>She has wavy hair that knots easily but its not very thick so many products weigh it down and make it look greasy.  </li>
      <li>My 18 month of son has fine straight hair, and in the morning he&#x27;s a total bedhead brillo pad if we don&#x27;t use this.  </li>
      <li>Too much fragrance for a baby.</li>
      <li>This works very well for my curly-haired baby.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
      <li>My daughter is 16 months and has so much hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff was good and now it sucks.</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product because it&#x27;s almost like water, and I find it to be an okay but not great detangler; it does take a good bit of product to get the tangles out of thick adult hair, but while I&#x27;m dealing with this oily scalp problem and desire to keep all harmful stuff away while pregnant, I find it worth the extra time it takes to do the job.  </li>
      <li>After reading a review which claimed that this product requires an excessive amount to work, I felt compelled to write a review of my own.</li>
      <li>so I cant say our home is entirely organic, but I feel beauty products have been chock full of carcinogens for years</li>
      <li>Unlike some reviewers, I don&#x27;t find the smell off-putting at all - it&#x27;s pleasant enough, very light and unnoticeable once hair is dry (and yes, my sense of smell is CRAZY right now).  </li>
      <li>I spray it on his wet hair after shampooing and toweling off; it has a very light scent that fades by the next day.</li>
      <li>paraben (and other yucky stuff) - free, which is why I purchased&lt;br</li>
      <li>and my sister loves how it helps to manage without being oily or weighing down her fine hair.</li>
      <li>My daughter has super thick, curly hair which gets tangled so easily, and I&#x27;m constantly trying new products to keep it under control.</li>
      <li>I know it says it is for &amp;#34;tots&amp;#34; but I am an adult female</li>
      <li>I do still miss my Davines Nounou leave-in conditioner because it made my hair so silky and shiny, but if you need a very lightweight detangler without all the icky stuff found in typical products, whether it be for a child or because you&#x27;re pregnant</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t found a better spray for dry hair, but just not great for that purpose.</li>

<li> Haven&#x27;t found a better spray for dry hair, but just not great for that purpose.</li>
<li> What&#x27;s worse, his hair is actually more ratty/frizzy and less curly in the back since we started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Just a few squirts and my son&#x27;s thick hair is tangle-free and easy to comb.  </li>
<li> I had to stop using my extra-moisturizing conditioner, but that left me with knotted, dry ends.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s amazingly difficult to find a light, non-oily leave in conditioner that doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals, especially synthetic fragrance.  </li>
<li> Kind of disappointed.</li>
<li> I use on dry or wet hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny if you care about the chemicals you spray on your kids head.</li>
<li> so I am careful with what I put on my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> feel there is a preponderance of unnecessary and even toxic chemicals in much of our day to day</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;as expected</li>
<li> We use it with the Wet Brush Mini on my 2yo.</li>
<li> I have very long, thick hi-lighted hair that needs extra TLC a few inches from the scalp, but my oily scalp has been a MAJOR issue</li>
<li> Detangles your hair without leaving it flat and heavy</li>
<li> Unlike the other reviewer, I had to use a very minimal amount of product to achieve the desired results.</li>
<li> Helps with tangles but is lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t weigh her hair down.</li>
<li> Since I&#x27;ve become pregnant, I&#x27;ve had to stop using ALL of my old haircare products, either because they contained phthalates or because they were too heavy for my now terribly oily scalp.  </li>
<li> The knots in the back of baby&#x27;s hair are just as tough to get out with the conditioner as without it.  </li>
<li> My daughter has very thick hair that gets very dry.</li>
<li> We use on his wet hair before we comb it at bed, and can even spray it on dry hair if it&#x27;s crazy in the morning.  </li>
<li> As a child that suffers with eczema I have to be choosy with what products in use on her, and this one passed with flying colors.</li>
<li> I started getting scalp acne, including painful cystic acne along the nape of my neck.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a terrible product now.</li>

    <li> This is the best leave in conditioning spray I have ever used.  I know it says it is for &amp;#34;tots&amp;#34; but I am an adult female and I having been using it daily for years and it is fabulous.  It has no harsh chemicals and smells nice.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as a standalone conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair. Kind of disappointed. And it has a pretty strong floral scent.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!  Just a few squirts and my son&#x27;s thick hair is tangle-free and easy to comb.  Nice, light scent and totally natural.  Works so well I use it on my hair, too!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> works great.  helped my daughter&#x27;s hair grow.  It gets out knots with out tears!  I use on dry or wet hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 16 months and has so much hair. I need to wash it every day because she gets stuff in it. I worried about her hair drying out and my hair dresser recommended that I use a leave in conditioner for her. I bought this because it is natural, it leaves my daughters hair soft and beautiful. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! I use it daily and in between washes on my daughter&#x27;s hair. Her hair never looks greasy and it has a clean fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my baby niece and my sister loves how it helps to manage without being oily or weighing down her fine hair.</li>
    <li> My 18 month of son has fine straight hair, and in the morning he&#x27;s a total bedhead brillo pad if we don&#x27;t use this.  We use on his wet hair before we comb it at bed, and can even spray it on dry hair if it&#x27;s crazy in the morning.  Never greasy and smells great. A+++++</li>
    <li> After much searching, this product is the one we like the best. Brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair is now easy and it controls the friz, turning her natural curls into a silky, styled look. I can&#x27;t recomment this product enough!! We use it with the Wet Brush Mini on my 2yo.</li>
    <li> Seems to help with frizzies etc.  I give my hair a good spritz before styling!  Works well!</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner has been a life-saver during my pregnancy!  It&#x27;s amazingly difficult to find a light, non-oily leave in conditioner that doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals, especially synthetic fragrance.  Since I&#x27;ve become pregnant, I&#x27;ve had to stop using ALL of my old haircare products, either because they contained phthalates or because they were too heavy for my now terribly oily scalp.  I have very long, thick hi-lighted hair that needs extra TLC a few inches from the scalp, but my oily scalp has been a MAJOR issue - it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m a teenager again.  I started getting scalp acne, including painful cystic acne along the nape of my neck.  I had to stop using my extra-moisturizing conditioner, but that left me with knotted, dry ends.  This TotLogic leave in conditioner helped me find just the right balance and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my prenatal acne.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product because it&#x27;s almost like water, and I find it to be an okay but not great detangler; it does take a good bit of product to get the tangles out of thick adult hair, but while I&#x27;m dealing with this oily scalp problem and desire to keep all harmful stuff away while pregnant, I find it worth the extra time it takes to do the job.  I think this would be a perfect conditioning/detangling spray for a child, although I haven&#x27;t used it for this purpose yet, and I plan on using this on my daughter when she needs it.  Unlike some reviewers, I don&#x27;t find the smell off-putting at all - it&#x27;s pleasant enough, very light and unnoticeable once hair is dry (and yes, my sense of smell is CRAZY right now).  I do still miss my Davines Nounou leave-in conditioner because it made my hair so silky and shiny, but if you need a very lightweight detangler without all the icky stuff found in typical products, whether it be for a child or because you&#x27;re pregnant, you might give TotLogic a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair - works really well to get the tangles out!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  My daughter hates getting her hair done.  It&#x27;s fine and curly and this has been a dream product.  I can finally comb her hair without tears.</li>
    <li> nice product&lt;br /&gt;as expected</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick hair that gets very dry. We are African American and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work. I love this product and I am buying more.</li>
    <li> Good product for wet hair. Haven&#x27;t found a better spray for dry hair, but just not great for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and my granddaughters hair is shiny now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: What happened!!! This stuff was good and now it sucks. It&#x27;s like water. You guys ruined it. It&#x27;s a terrible product now.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product to help with my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has wavy hair that knots easily but its not very thick so many products weigh it down and make it look greasy.  I am very happy with your product.  It tames the frizziness while maintaining some of the waves and its also easier to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel there is a preponderance of unnecessary and even toxic chemicals in much of our day to day I so try to limit it where I could.  Sometimes price is an issue so I cant say our home is entirely organic, but I feel beauty products have been chock full of carcinogens for years so I am careful with what I put on my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work.  I am happy with your product and will be staying with it.</li>
    <li> This works very well for my curly-haired baby. I spray it on his wet hair after shampooing and toweling off; it has a very light scent that fades by the next day. It works well for detangling but is not a miracle detangler; I&#x27;ll still encounter a knot that needs to be snipped off every so often. I&#x27;m glad I found this safer option (rated 4 on EWG).</li>
    <li> After reading a review which claimed that this product requires an excessive amount to work, I felt compelled to write a review of my own. My daughter has super thick, curly hair which gets tangled so easily, and I&#x27;m constantly trying new products to keep it under control. I came across this online and decided to give it a try and am so happy that I did! Unlike the other reviewer, I had to use a very minimal amount of product to achieve the desired results. For her thick hair, that was about 4 sprays and it worked beautifully! The scent was very light and clean smelling. My daughter even exclaimed &amp;#34;my hair smells so good!&amp;#34;  It sprayed evenly in a fairly light mist, and then I combed it through her freshly washed hair. I had zero stubborn knots when using this, and it left her hair incredibly soft and great smelling! On top of all of this, her skin was not irritated. As a child that suffers with eczema I have to be choosy with what products in use on her, and this one passed with flying colors.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my curly-haired toddler who has been getting knots and ratty hair in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - smells nice and only lightly fragrant&lt;br /&gt;- paraben (and other yucky stuff) - free, which is why I purchased&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t really work.  I have used it for a week after shampooing hair in the bath.  The knots in the back of baby&#x27;s hair are just as tough to get out with the conditioner as without it.  What&#x27;s worse, his hair is actually more ratty/frizzy and less curly in the back since we started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning and back in the market for a baby conditioner!</li>
    <li> Detangles your hair without leaving it flat and heavy</li>
    <li> Great product! Helps with tangles but is lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t weigh her hair down. She loves that she has her own spray too!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny if you care about the chemicals you spray on your kids head.</li>
    <li> Too much fragrance for a baby. Maybe better for an older child. I didn&#x27;t like the scent but perhaps someone else would.</li>
