      <li>came before schedule but looks cheap</li>

<li> Flowers were a little messed up</li>
<li> I have a small head</li>
<li> I also noticed a few threads coming out, I hope nothing unravels!</li>
<li> Came broken.</li>
<li> but I was very anxious to add this beauty to my head band collection!</li>
<li> Bad quality , when I opened the envelope two flowers felt off</li>
