      <li>I sure hope that they don&#x27;t discontinue the original version--although it seems to be a trend that whatever is good and works well gets discontinued or replaced.</li>
      <li>with Sure</li>
      <li>Better then going to a store which almost never has this product.</li>
      <li>Ive use Sure  for years</li>
      <li>The sell was ok.</li>
      <li>used for years love it</li>
      <li>many claim this</li>
      <li>Sure as a scent, do not know what they are talking</li>
      <li>So glad i can order a six pack for my bf..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sure Unscented \\&quot;Original\\</li>
      <li>i assure you this Sure has no perfumes or scent.</li>
      <li>(even many that say unscented.)  </li>
      <li>glad I can still get this product..</li>
      <li>I went looking for Sure deodorant in the grocery store and couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad Amazon has  it ..</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m glad I can find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Sure has always worked best for me to keep me dry and provide scentless protection.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why Sure isn&#x27;t making the original unscented formula available in stores anymore, but I \\&quot;sure\\&quot; was thankful to find it here!</li>
      <li>I like the unscented original deodorant but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Original Unscented formula of Sure for years.</li>
      <li>easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
      <li>It is STRONGLY perfumed with a smell that doesn&#x27;t go away if you make the mistake of putting it on your skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Makes you wonder how horrendously strong the perfume is on their \\&quot;scented\\&quot; varieties.</li>
      <li>And the best part is, I pay slighly less than in store prices, even after shopping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge help to get a bulk pack price</li>
      <li>Thankfully it was cheap.</li>
      <li>Also, when you get toward the end of the 3.3, the remainder is likely to fly out onto the floor.  </li>
      <li>This original formula is truly unscented.</li>
      <li>I wish they had skipped that piece and kept some more expense into a higher quality</li>
      <li>Sure so glad to find the old school original.</li>
      <li>Personally I think it performs better than the invisible kind.</li>
      <li>Hope these never get discontinued as most of the modern deodorants smell like a locker room or a cheap date.</li>
      <li>I really like being able to purchase this in bulk instead of having to search among thousands of choices at the store.</li>
      <li>I used the solid unscented for years and loved it.</li>
      <li>I guess as long as its working this is a good thing.</li>
      <li>My husband and I both use Sure deodorant, but what&#x27;s up with the new look?</li>
      <li>The new product says original and unscented-but its not !</li>
      <li>Still the same product as far as we can tell, great.  </li>
      <li>The Original takes me back to the good old days when we had white marks on our clothes and we liked it like that.</li>
      <li>Not to mention that it globs up and falls off, which can be embarrassing, but also can cause problems (like when it fell right into the microphone hole of my phone</li>
      <li>Because with its girly new packaging and light purple cap, its now in the women&#x27;s deodorant section.  </li>
      <li>A great, unscented deodorant for men is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
      <li>I also like to not mix so many different scentes like shampoo deodorant cologne cream shaving cream &amp; soap after all this u stink.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, has no scent, and keeps you dry and odor free all day.  </li>
      <li>on top of that they tack on a $6.50 charge, so it would actually end up costing me more in the long run.</li>
      <li>Not everyone wants or is able to use layers of scents in their personal care products and toiletries.</li>
      <li>We love this one because it lasts a long time and we don&#x27;t have to reapply it if we change clothes after work to go out.</li>
      <li>off one star for this reason...I don&#x27;t think this is exactly the same original as when I was a kid.</li>
      <li>It goes on real smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave messy residue.  </li>
      <li>The antiperspirant really doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t want to us some heavily-scented option, so</li>
      <li>alwyas fast delivery..</li>
      <li>about.there is absolutely</li>
      <li>very well.</li>
      <li>guess now I have to switch to the HYPER masculine brands, with scent names ARTIC FORCE, FORCE FIELD and FRESH KILL.  </li>
      <li>I really like this deoderant.  </li>
      <li>There is absolutely none in this.</li>
      <li>Really?</li>
      <li>I found this and started stocking it for the whole family.  </li>
      <li>Thank you for having this in stock and for such fast delivery!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not sure why other reviewers are mentioning fragrance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m assuming it is becoming harder to find due to the fact that most people want an invisible.</li>
      <li>We frequently have difficulty finding this exact product in the stores.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find this as it has been hard to find in the regular store retail sector...</li>
      <li>This also has a nice texture, a little creamy for easy application but dry enough to stay put and do it&#x27;s job.  </li>
      <li>and they come in sturdy shrink-wrap that I double-bag in a ziplock to ensure they stay fresh to the last stick.  </li>
      <li>Deodorant was always a problem, as most of them are heavily perfumed.  </li>
      <li>Im allergic to the new</li>
      <li>Exactly what the description says, I just wish they would last longer.</li>
      <li>Sure, no pun intended, it may keep the top of the solid smoother for when you first open it, but after that the plastic piece is useless and I throw it away.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough that I can apply right after shaving if necessary.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about to reorder - there&#x27;s a 3.3oz 6-pack now available for less money.&lt;br</li>

    <li> The store I usually purchase this deodorant from was out the last two times I went to buy it, so I checked out Amazon.  I am sensitive to perfumes, so I can&#x27;t just buy any deodorant.  Sure has always worked best for me to keep me dry and provide scentless protection.</li>
    <li> I am at least ready to meet the world now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find this as it has been hard to find in the regular store retail sector...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimmmy</li>
    <li> Sure Solid Original Unscented is VERY difficult to locate in stores in my area. It is the only antiperspirant/deodorant that works well for me. So out of frustration I looked on-line and voila AMAZON came through for me. They had the product and the shipping was rapid.</li>
    <li> I used the solid unscented for years and loved it.Then I tried the invisible and its worthless doesn&#x27;t work.Went back to the solid and they changed something to the point it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.They probably changed something to save money and now they have a product that doesn&#x27;t work and will probably go out of business on this product. Sure sucks</li>
    <li> So glad i can order a six pack for my bf.. This is the one he uses.. and he gets so mad he cant find it... I am so glad Amazon has  it .. I recommed ordering in bulk if you can.. i just odered the six -pack.. alwyas fast delivery.. its messed up how they dont be stocking it...cmon ppl..</li>
    <li> used for years love it</li>
    <li> Perfect example of a great product I&#x27;ve ysed for many years. Then I suspect the bean counters think they have found a way to increase profit so they change the formula. Now it sucks. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find my favorite deoderant on the store shelves so was very pleased to find it here.  Also the arrival time was very fast and the products were in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why Sure isn&#x27;t making the original unscented formula available in stores anymore, but I \\&quot;sure\\&quot; was thankful to find it here! The invisible formula irritates my skin, and even the unscented has a scent. This original formula is truly unscented. I hope the product makers consider those of us who fight allergies, and quit advertising products as unscented when they aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I ordered two six packs of this deodorant.  Even Walmart can&#x27;t beat the price I paid.  I like unscented so I can add my own scent.</li>
    <li> We were sent the wrong product.  Have written to ask for a return, but have not yet heard back.</li>
    <li> Unscented Sure solid is getting almost impossible to find local.  ordered here at Amazon , they have great prices and the seller always provides great service through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Noted many claim this Sure as a scent, do not know what they are talking about.there is absolutely No Scent at all. I can not use perfumed or scented Deodorant they cause me to itch, so i assure you this Sure has no perfumes or scent. I have been using the spray which causes me to itch,( the aerosol causes the problem ) but was the only thing they still sell locally.....had to get away from it....so I purchased here. As always Amazon has sellers one can buy just about anything.</li>
    <li> I used to wear Almay solid and they discontinued making it and I have such bad eczema all over and I itch and breakout constantly so my Dermatologist recommended this but in the aerosol form and I continued to break out using the aerosol and constantly itched but I read reviews on this solid and now I have much less itching and irritation.</li>
    <li> the worst part of deodorants are the when they are scented it seam as you put on the whole bottel of colon on but with Sure i don&#x27;t even sweat. It;s hard to find the unscented in the supermarket and costo stop selling it. I also like to not mix so many different scentes like shampoo deodorant cologne cream shaving cream &amp; soap after all this u stink. So i do all unscented and just add cologne.</li>
    <li> So happy I can find the product I want and can easily afford through your store. Thank you for having this in stock and for such fast delivery!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Original Unscented formula of Sure for years. Personally I think it performs better than the invisible kind. The only problem was, stores quit selling it. Now I buy it in bulk from Amazon. It&#x27;s great! And the best part is, I pay slighly less than in store prices, even after shopping.</li>
    <li> Sure Original Unscented is the best deodorant ever made. I&#x27;m assuming it is becoming harder to find due to the fact that most people want an invisible. The invisible does not work the same. The Original takes me back to the good old days when we had white marks on our clothes and we liked it like that. If anyone stunk I&#x27;d discretely recommend this and we&#x27;d never smell them again. Now I&#x27;m hoping the same for me as I&#x27;ve developed smelly pits recently. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why other reviewers are mentioning fragrance. There is absolutely none in this. Possibly they were sent the wrong product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took off one star for this reason...I don&#x27;t think this is exactly the same original as when I was a kid. Seems like there&#x27;s been a little change...but barely. I&#x27;m hardly getting any residue white marks. I guess as long as its working this is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  My wife brought home a few from Walmart today, and I initially thought she bought the wrong product.  It looks like a woman&#x27;s deodorant now.  I&#x27;ll try it, and hope it&#x27;s the same product; but the manufacturer needs to change the packaging or risk losing male customers.  I really don&#x27;t want to us some heavily-scented option, so I hope this product won&#x27;t be so difficult to find in the future.</li>
    <li> Im allergic to the new Sure so glad to find the old school original.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sure Unscented \\&quot;Original\\&quot; Solid for decades - since before it was called \\&quot;Original\\&quot;.  Unfortunately, it has been displaced in all local stores with Sure Unscented \\&quot;Invisible\\&quot; Solid - and that product is strongly and offensively scented.  I keep meaning to write the FDA....  Anyhow, I bought the 6-pack at Amazon, great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update June 6, 2010] I&#x27;m about to reorder - there&#x27;s a 3.3oz 6-pack now available for less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update April 24, 2011] The packaging of the 2.7 oz. product is well-engineered.  However, the lid on the 3.3 oz. product does not click on, making it unsuitable for travel or a gym bag.  Also, when you get toward the end of the 3.3, the remainder is likely to fly out onto the floor.  If you feel like dusting it off, you have to apply it by holding the stub in your hand.  So the 3.3 is not much of a bargain.</li>
    <li> Ive use Sure  for years so I have no issues with the product,only the sellers inability to use my complete address on the package.If your label printer only prints 3 lines then you MUST  hand write the part of the complete address that does not fit on the mailing label. I cant believe I even have to tell merchants this.IF your goal is to be a effective efficient merchant.Obviously,this IS NOT JUSTOTC.com&#x27;s goal. I will be VERY reluctant to do any future business with JUSTOTC.com</li>
    <li> Probably the worst deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried. Lasted for about an hour. I am in shock about how well the reviews are for this. Thankfully it was cheap.</li>
    <li> My family all suffer from allergies and prefer unscented products.  Deodorant was always a problem, as most of them are heavily perfumed.  I found this and started stocking it for the whole family.  It is unisex and works effectively for males and females.  It goes on smoothly, has no scent, and keeps you dry and odor free all day.  It is a relief not having that overbearing deodorant scent in the laundry.</li>
    <li> very good product and excellent quality. the price was the best, I recommend it to everyone. do not hesitate to buy it.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find it here as I really like the product and have used it for years. I live in South Florida, which is probably the ultimate test for an anti-perspirant. The &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; unscented version (which you can find anywhere) is not nearly as effective. I sure hope that they don&#x27;t discontinue the original version--although it seems to be a trend that whatever is good and works well gets discontinued or replaced.</li>
    <li> Glad to find this product!</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this.  Absolutely no scent and no skin irritation.  We bought dozens of these at a discount grocery years ago and kept using that stash for 5 years past expiration.  Then we tried and tried to find something else that was unscented, worked and didn&#x27;t irritate our skin...no luck.  We were hopeful when I found this on Amazon.  Still the same product as far as we can tell, great.  Of course, being a white stick deodorant, one needs to be careful putting your shirt on after applying it, but well worth the effort.</li>
    <li> One of the only deodorants I have found that does not break me out.  I order in bulk to always keep on hand.</li>
    <li> We like unscented deodorant because we don&#x27;t want the scent of it mixing with our cologne. We love this one because it lasts a long time and we don&#x27;t have to reapply it if we change clothes after work to go out.</li>
    <li> Thank God they&#x27;re still making this. Never found anything else that worked and didn&#x27;t give me asthma with fragrance (even many that say unscented.)  It&#x27;s a huge help to get a bulk pack price and they come in sturdy shrink-wrap that I double-bag in a ziplock to ensure they stay fresh to the last stick.  This also has a nice texture, a little creamy for easy application but dry enough to stay put and do it&#x27;s job.  It&#x27;s gentle enough that I can apply right after shaving if necessary.</li>
    <li> I went looking for Sure deodorant in the grocery store and couldn&#x27;t find it.  Why?  Because with its girly new packaging and light purple cap, its now in the women&#x27;s deodorant section.  Who makes these asinine product decisions?  Like when Lego decided to court girls, they just couldn&#x27;t market the product to girls, they had to come up with pink and purple Lego&#x27;s.  Really? And now we have this wispy design. Even this man loving man doesn&#x27;t want to be seen at the cashier with this product.  WORSE, my mother opens the medicine cabinet and then asks &amp;#34;why are you buying women&#x27;s deodorant.  Nope, not going to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess now I have to switch to the HYPER masculine brands, with scent names ARTIC FORCE, FORCE FIELD and FRESH KILL.  Seriously, if I wanted to smell like a 14 year old boy, I could buy AXE. Not going to do it.</li>
    <li> Excelente Product!! Just as described by seller!</li>
    <li> If you are allergic to scents or the masking fragrance used in too many &#x27;unscented&#x27; products, think seriously before buying this.&lt;br /&gt;It is not only the label which has been changed here, the product itself has been as well.&lt;br /&gt;I gently removed the cap, took a small sniff, there is now a fragrance to the unscented deo. Could be the masking fragrance, but instant migraine and allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to return them, but the only option is to return via UPS and on top of that they tack on a $6.50 charge, so it would actually end up costing me more in the long run.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product but most of all outstanding Customer Service</li>
    <li> Very happy to have found this here.  A great, unscented deodorant for men is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;Most lines smell like &#x27;Axe&#x27;...and I am not a teenager!</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband--good price.</li>
    <li> Hope these never get discontinued as most of the modern deodorants smell like a locker room or a cheap date.</li>
    <li> This product is good quality.  I have a hard time finding this product in original and unscientific.  The sell was ok.</li>
    <li> I used this product line for about 15 years, but something changed a year or two ago. After suffering with its shortcomings, now I&#x27;ve switched to Gillette Clinical (strength) Sensitive Skin. More expensive per-unit cost, but probably about the same overall cost in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things seem to have changed. One minor issue was that now it has a plastic inner cap that&#x27;s useless. Sure, no pun intended, it may keep the top of the solid smoother for when you first open it, but after that the plastic piece is useless and I throw it away. I wish they had skipped that piece and kept some more expense into a higher quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major issue is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to work like it used to. The antiperspirant really doesn&#x27;t work well. Not to mention that it globs up and falls off, which can be embarrassing, but also can cause problems (like when it fell right into the microphone hole of my phone and I had to take my phone apart before people could hear me on my call). This is unacceptable. In fact, I had planned on setting at three stars, but that&#x27;s probably over-rated because I won&#x27;t be buying it anymore. Two stars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s antiperspirant.  It works, at least with my biochemistry.  It&#x27;s far more effective than the awful &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; stuff, which is clearly why they brought this back.  It&#x27;s actually unscented.  Why would you use anything else?</li>
    <li> This deodorant is the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Better then going to a store which almost never has this product. Very good service and well worth what you pay.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just deodorant, what could go wrong.  Exactly what the description says, I just wish they would last longer.</li>
    <li> Keeps you dry and fresh</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, Sure Original Unscented is a hard to find product.  Found it on Amazon and received just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I like the unscented original deodorant but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores. They always have the invisible solid. So being able to order it in bulk this way is great.</li>
    <li> Sure works very nicely and I love the no fragrance model</li>
    <li> glad I can still get this product..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a multipack of this product twice from the same seller.  The product works fine for awhile with no issues, but suddenly crumbles and falls out of the container in pieces about 2/3 of the way down the stick.  This has happened with every stick in two 8-packs.  It&#x27;s not the same quality of execution as when Procter and Gamble owned the brand.  It is possible that the product is old or stored under adverse conditions.</li>
    <li> most effective deodorant for me.</li>
    <li> I really like this deoderant.  It goes on real smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave messy residue.  When applied it feels very dry and solid.  I really cannot stand deoderant because sometimes it can get messy but this one is a winner.</li>
    <li> I really like being able to purchase this in bulk instead of having to search among thousands of choices at the store.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> Used this product for years. Hard to find in stores with all the new products that are coming out. Amazon.com had it at resonalbe price.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use Sure deodorant, but what&#x27;s up with the new look? It looks totally feminine! I&#x27;m embarrassed to buy it for him now.</li>
    <li> I like the unscented but antiperspirant aspect does not last long as newer ones.</li>
    <li> After being increasingly difficult to find in stores, we&#x27;ve finally found an easy and convenient source for our preferred UNSCENTED deodorant. Not everyone wants or is able to use layers of scents in their personal care products and toiletries. And this Sure does a very good job as an anti-perspirant as well.</li>
    <li> We frequently have difficulty finding this exact product in the stores.  We&#x27;re thrilled to be able to get it here.</li>
    <li> The new product says original and unscented-but its not ! Just read the ingredients-says fragrance !!! And it smells like it !!!</li>
    <li> It does work as advertised. very well. easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Sure Original Solid Anti-Perspirant and Deodorant, Unscented isn&#x27;t harsh to underarms.</li>
    <li> I could never find this in the store when I need it. It&#x27;s the only brand that works for me without itching etc. So I&#x27;m glad I can find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Thank you the item is great!</li>
    <li> Confirming what others have said -- if you want unscented deodorant, do NOT buy this stuff.  It is STRONGLY perfumed with a smell that doesn&#x27;t go away if you make the mistake of putting it on your skin. It takes quite a while to go away even after you wash it off! (So much for that little experiment. :D)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes you wonder how horrendously strong the perfume is on their \\&quot;scented\\&quot; varieties.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to everything else, since the store closed down the street, I have no choice to order it online.</li>
    <li> Items were delivered with no issues.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  So sister has also and her friend so we got together and bought in bulk.</li>
