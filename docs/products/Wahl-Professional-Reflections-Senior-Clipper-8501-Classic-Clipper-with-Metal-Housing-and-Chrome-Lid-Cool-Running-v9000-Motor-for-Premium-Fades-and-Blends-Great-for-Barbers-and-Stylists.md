      <li>Amazing clippers, well worth the price!  </li>
      <li>He really likes them and says they are easy to handle and provide a great cut.</li>
      <li>These were recommended to my by my barber, they&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
      <li>Clippers cut pretty good with guards on, but without the guard they dig into skin and pull it.</li>
      <li>It really feels great in your hand, and trims really smooth.</li>
      <li>will say that this clipper has good weight (1.3 pounds) to it and feels very sturdy and well made and is very nice to look at with its chromed out front PLASTIC cover and the nice polished METAL back piece.</li>
      <li>I figured I&#x27;d spend the money on a better pair for clippers instead of buying a pair of cheap clippers twice a year</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Construction is solid and they run smooth.  Versatile because you can use them to do a full cut from balding to tapering to cutting and blending using the guards.</li>
    <li> This is a professional  grade  product all the way.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the super speedy delivery. Product was just as described. These clippers are THE BEST as far as I&#x27;m so concerned. I&#x27;m so glad I was able to order them from you at such an affordable price. Looking forward to doing business with you guys again. EXCELLENT! FIVE STARS!! *****  :-)</li>
    <li> Great product.  Exactly as described.  Bought as a Christmas present and my husband loves it. Cuts great!</li>
    <li> My husband love&#x27;s his new clippers and my husband and son&#x27;s look absolutely handsome after my husband does their hair .</li>
    <li> Shipping was ok. Took a little long. Other than that clippers are amazing. I own a pair of andis master clip and gotta say they do not come close to wahl clippers.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice look.  I mean who knew clippers could look stylish?  The motor works fine, but I see no apprecaible difference than other Wahl adjustable clipper designs.  The BIG detractor is the heat generated by these clippers.  Because the body is metallic, it holds a great amount of heat.  I have 5 boys, and by the time I got to my 3rd son&#x27;s hair...I was hot potatoeing the clippers from right hand to left hand.    I am surprised professionals say they like these...maybe they have built up a super hero like calous on their hands and are no longer affected like us mere mortals!    Bottom line.  While the metal looks great, I&#x27;d advise you get the plastic ones.</li>
    <li> Product was Exactly what I wanted, and the Description was right on point!</li>
    <li> Saw some good and bad reviews on these clippers.  I&#x27;m 26 and bought my 1set set of Wahl clippers in 2003, they wernt this kind but still a good set of clippers that lasted me until 2010 before they started acting up.  Researched these and was caught by the stainless housing and strength of the motor.  As soon as I got them I wanted to try them out and i could not be more pleased.  some complain about the wieght but i saw no problem with it.  Very durable and the cut was excellent and even.  One thin i do have to warn is that fresh out the box they come very sharp so be careful with your first couple cuts around the ears.  I look forward to using these clippers until they cant go anymore.  Best clippers i&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I am a barber. I been cutting hair for like 17 years ago. I am very happy with this clipper. Great investment.</li>
    <li> Amazing I love how they work on wet hair and dry hair</li>
    <li> Good clipper while it lasted but the piece that holds the moving blade together inside broke off randomly outta no where while I was cutting.</li>
    <li> Bought two for my boys away at college - they keep their hair short so they use them frequently. They love them. Their friends use them too. It beats paying for haircuts every 6 weeks. These clippers are much better quality than the ones we have bought at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> This product is a very good clipper. It cuts easily even hard hairs. Can also be used as shaver. The only drawback is that it gets hot in a few minutes. But it seems to be very well built and I can guarantee that it works great in different situations. If you need a strong and professional one, here is a good option. I bought it about year ago.</li>
    <li> This is the best pair of clippers I have bought. Thanks for all the reviews they helped with my choice!</li>
    <li> This product did not meet my expectations. It does cut thick hair easily, but it gets hot pretty fast ( Andis cool care did nothing!) and its pretty heavy. This is not a good clipper if your cutting your own hair. I&#x27;ve messed up many hair cuts using this clipper. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend  this clipper, especially at the price it sells at.</li>
    <li> good clippers.  probably the best Ive ever bought. Lets see how they hold up over time.  If youre looking for clippers to replace shaving... thye dont cut that low.  No clippers will.  there WILL be hair left.  I was looking for a shaving replacement.  Still, they cut closer than any other clippers Ive owned.  In that respect Im happy.</li>
    <li> Clippers cut pretty good with guards on, but without the guard they dig into skin and pull it. This can be annoying and painful. Also, the unit gets pretty hot after about 15 minutes of use.</li>
    <li> I am a professional, with 10 years of experience.  I do a ton of clipper cuts a day, these are great. They cut smooth and fade great, the are also not too heavy!! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> ****2009 Update****  After about 9 years of use (the last year of which I used them 5-6 times a month) It needed to be replaced!  When it comes to clippers I would only consider buying a pro grade one!  After checking all the models &amp; brands (just to see if anything better came out in the last 9 years) ***NOTING HAS***  I went and got another one of these!  This is the best clipper I have ever owned!!!  The clippers went through 9 years of abuse before they needed replacing and when I finally had to replace them the price was cheaper!!!!  YEAH!!!  Amazon has the best prices around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THESE CLIPPERS!  You will be glad you did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;****2006 Original Review****  I have had this model for years!  And I cut my hair with it 3-4 times a month between me &amp; my sons.  It is the best clipper set I have ever owned.  Most clippers I buy only last 1-2 years.  I have had this one I think 5-6 years!  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old non-professionl quality clippers. These are far superior. They cut perfectly, quickly and the edges of the hair are cut cleanly. The cut hair feels much softer compared to my old clippers which I&#x27;ve been using for about twenty years. They are a bit heavier than my old plastic clippers, but create much less vibration. Equally good for head and body hair.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the \\&quot;Wahl Sterling Reflections Senior Clipper #8501\\&quot; and I am amazed at the sharpness of the blades and the power of the V5000 motor.  These clippers cut with ease and precision.  The design and motor housing is simple yet of sturdy construction and probably lasting.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best clippers I have owned.  I have not paid for a haricut in more than 7 years.  Before these, I owned a cheap Conway clipper.  They ended up tearing the hair out as oppose to cutting.  The Wahl&#x27;s are far superior in build quality, noise reduction and smooth cutting.  Excellent product!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love it its way better then the mastera they dont heat uo as fast and you have a great grip, A++++++</li>
    <li> Great quality - love the look</li>
    <li> A very powerful clipper that will cut my thick hair in one quick stroke.  To my pleasant surprise it also came with blades and other accessories even though that wasn&#x27;t included in the product description.  The tapering lever has a wide range, probably a quarter inch.  My only complaint is that they are extremely loud.  When I adjust the power down to reduce the volume it&#x27;s not strong enough to cut. I have to wear earplugs when I use them and the noise annoys my wife, but other than that it is an awesome product. I am fairly confident that this problem can be resolved through tinkering with the screws.  Include blades, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, left taper, right taper.  Also came with oil, brush, and blade guard.</li>
    <li> A+++ Product! Feels very sturdy! Performs very well!  Amazing clippers, well worth the price!  Was shipped 3 days early!  Just need trimmers to match!</li>
    <li> I choose this product after reading some online comment but it turn out to be worst than I expected. Loud , can&#x27;t cut hair correctly.</li>
    <li> I am a professional hairstylist. I use these clippers every day. They work well and I don&#x27;t have to go over and over the same section of hair to get a nice even cut. They are nice looking too!</li>
    <li> After comparing many clippers on Amazon, I chose this one and so far I am very satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels very good holding the clipper in hand. The blade is sharp and the combs are very useful and easy to use.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for and this is GOOD! Cuts hair like a breeze. Replaceable heads. No more cheapo clippers for me. (Not a barber or professional of any kind just like a #3 buzz cut). Thanks</li>
    <li> These clippers give you a nice solid feel when it&#x27;s in your hands. It cuts my hair like a finely tuned machine. Im glad I made the purchase after researching so many other options. Also, comes with more adaptors than I will ever need!</li>
    <li> Very affordable light weight and powerful clipper. Cuts really smooth.  In case you were wondering, this is the V9000 motor.</li>
    <li> Not a professional hair stylist so wouldn&#x27;t know a good clipper from a bad one unless it fell apart or made some bazaar noises.&lt;br /&gt;Feels heavy and built to last so I hope it does.</li>
    <li> Bought this clipper and its great clipper cuts like butter! blades come crooked just have to adjust them takes 5 seconds. Other than that its a pretty good clipper... Same clipper as the black five star senior just different case cover..</li>
    <li> Great clippers they cut like butter and they are light and nice in the hand worth getting these wahls are great</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a strong clipper it works great it&#x27;s fast it&#x27;s a heavy duty clipper recommended to any hairstylist and it&#x27;s a whal</li>
    <li> Just upgraded to these clippers and already have noticed a huge difference!</li>
    <li> And they are great! I used them on my husbands thick, coarse, curly hair. It was quick, easy and like a hot knife cutting threw butter. I will update and let you know how these hold up as this is 3rd kind I bought now in 3 yrs. So I hope they continue to work well considering the cost. Also even with little light the hair was cut even pretty much the first time even with long, thick, curly, coarse hair! Not to bad on my hands either as I have fibromyalgia and arthritis. It did get a little hot at the end when I was done and making sure I got every where even. It took 15 mins for it to heat up and even then it was not as bad as my plastic osters.</li>
    <li> Ima up coming barber but im very picky with wat I use nd wat clippers want. I have a pair of Andis Masters amd I love em. But i wanted a back up clipper in case my masters get hot cuz they do in due time. Since ive has these, ive loved them!!! Great guards for fading.  And also has a great feel. Not to heavy. Nd hardly gets hot. But will if yur constantly using them. (Witch is normal) but cannot complain one bit. Yu WONT regret it 5 STARS!!!</li>
    <li> Its a lot nicer than those cheep $20 dollar clippers you get from retail stores. A quality made product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal andis customer for 16 years....buying these walls has changed my life....haircuts take half the time and are sharper looking than before....this is a great tool.  My only disappointment is the chrome cover is plastic.</li>
    <li> They were not what i expected. The cord wraps up when cutting not good. Cords are to be lose at all times.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, he is a barber and he loves it, says it works very well.</li>
    <li> I lo ve it, cut perfect, but un 10 por 15 minutes es hoy, i need buy 3 o more clippers</li>
    <li> Best clipper for fades or blending and blades last.i can use on wet or dry hair and I am a professional barber</li>
    <li> I just purchased this Wahl Sterling Senior hair clipper and it is exactly what I expected, a professional quality product.  I have been reviewing Wahl clippers and considered purchasing one of their cordless models instead.  After all considerations, I finally decided to purchase the Sterling Senior because of the quality of design, the price and most of important, the power. Amazon does not list the product correctly.  The Sterling Senior has a V9000 motor not as some reviews mentioned as a V5000.  Once you turn it on you know it is a quality product.  The unit is very sturdy and the bottom casing is all stainless steel.  The blades are quality and very sharp, just like they say, cuts like butter.  The cord is 7 1/2 feet long, not 10 feet as some reviewers mentioned. The only minor issue I have is that it does not come with some kind of accessory bag or pouch to put the hair clipper and accessories in once you open the box. Overall, you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I guess based on the top reviews I was expecting way too much from this clipper. I felt that this clipper didn&#x27;t cut as smoothly even with the v9000 motor (had to go over the same section more than a few times) as my other Wahl clippers and these got warm to hot in just 20-25 minutes while my other Wahl clippers can go 40 minutes before they get warm and 50 minutes before they start to get hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not sure if this clipper was used because it looked new but the cutting blade I&#x27;m almost certain was used or old because it wasn&#x27;t as sharp as my other Wahl cutting blades when I switched them to see if my hunch was right. When I did switch the cutting blade the clipper cut much better. But I&#x27;m not reviewing my other cutting blade, I&#x27;m reviewing the Sterling Reflections as it came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this clipper has good weight (1.3 pounds) to it and feels very sturdy and well made and is very nice to look at with its chromed out front PLASTIC cover and the nice polished METAL back piece. And the v9000 motor is noticeably more powerful than my v5000 clippers. Now, if I were to keep my balding blade on the Sterling Reflections with the v9000 motor, I would give this clipper 4.5 stars because it cut really, really well. But if I were to do that, I would lose the versatility of the the adjustable blade because the balding blade is a fixed blade and that defeats the purpose of buying the Sterling Reflections. But like I said earlier, I&#x27;m not reviewing the balding blade on the Sterling Reflections, I&#x27;m reviewing the Sterling Reflections as it came out of the box with the adjustable blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad you can&#x27;t give half stars on reviews here because the Sterling Reflections is better than 3 stars but not quite good enough to give 4 stars to so I had to settle on 3 stars even though I&#x27;d like to give it 3.5 stars. Even with my mixed feelings about the Sterling Reflections I think one would get much use out of this clipper because of the strong motor and the adjustable blade and all the guide combs that come with it that gives you a ton of versatility to do multiple types of cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I added a bunch of pictures in the customer image gallery that you should check out.motor and the adjustable blade and all the guide combs that come with it that gives you a ton of versatility to do multiple types of cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.

    <li> Sleek design powerful motor smooth fades and takes down hair fast I love it a must have to any barber or stylist</li>
    <li> They work very well ... i love them !</li>
    <li> Its okay, it makes noises I don&#x27;t like, and was not expecting. It doest cut as sharp as before.</li>
    <li> Stellar performer as expected.  I choose it over the andis master as my primary clipper. With either the standard blade or fade blade it is a super versatile clipper. You can do any cut with this one clipper. It has a super powerful motor and cuts really smooth.</li>
    <li> One of the best hi quality Wahl&lt;br /&gt; I ever dealt with &amp; @ a better price than our local stores in town!&lt;br /&gt; I also must add,it&#x27;s a CLEAN look &amp; feel</li>
    <li> This machine is all business!  I do not do hair for a living, instead I use this to cut my own on a regular basis.  This thing is heavy and makes you feel like you have some quality product in your hands.  I look forward to getting quite a few years worth of use out of this good looking machine.</li>
    <li> nice clippers the wife love it</li>
    <li> Been a barber for about 20 years. This thing is awesome. Has the perfect weight in my hands and just feels like it&#x27;ll last decades. The best motor I&#x27;ve had in a set of clippers. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Poorly manufactured product! Im a stylist and have heavy use, but only after two weeks they broke on me. On the up side they are pretty lol.</li>
    <li> My third clipper set. The instructions for this one were so good, I was able to get my other two working again. Lot&#x27;s of neat gadgets to attach to it. Even got a comb.</li>
    <li> This thing is heavy which makes it a bit difficult to use when cutting your own hair especially holding a mirror with one hand.  The 20.00 cutter at Rite Aid is easier to handle. &lt;br /&gt;Also, the smallest length attachment doesn&#x27;t line up with the metal cutters and it has some burrs on it which tend to scrape the scalp a bit.   &lt;br /&gt;Buy the cheap model and replace the whole shaver when dull.</li>
    <li> My favorite Clipper, great motor, sharp blades, and it just looks awesome. 100% recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a professional quality hair trimmer. It is built to last. I had a cheaper wahl that laster 10 years. This one will no doubt last my life time. Has nice weight to it and looks very nice. It has never gotten hot. i cut a friends hair who had a full afro and it ate through his hair without any issues. Wish i knew about this years ago. Truely a professional wahl hair cutter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything as described. Thanks</li>
    <li> Cut very well.  Smooth cuts and easy to use product.  Price worth buying the product since it is very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Just awesome clippers all wahl professional clippers are 5***** I&#x27;m a professional barber and I use these on just about every haircut they cut flawlessly best purchase I ever made as a barber</li>
    <li> This is the model you should get. It&#x27;s all chrome metal and more powerful motor. I had a Wahl that after about 20 years finally stopped working. I expect this one to last as long or longer.</li>
    <li> I felt this item was a good item for the price.  It is sturdy, dependable, and cuts my hair evenly each time (granted I&#x27;m just buzzing it now a days).  I figured I&#x27;d spend the money on a better pair for clippers instead of buying a pair of cheap clippers twice a year and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet!</li>
    <li> I looked and looked around these are ok they do get hot and I do sometimes have to go back over the hair but they will cut straight threw any kind of hair and gel love the way they look and they are heavy hopefully once I break them in they will meet my standards!!!</li>
    <li> idk if its normal but it heats up pretty quick. I havent tried other brands but this one isnt bad at all.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot and the added weight isnt to much and helps keep the hand steady. They are perfect</li>
    <li> I work at a salon and so far I am loving this clipper. It is sturdy, feels good, and is pretty quiet so turning it on doesn&#x27;t scare the kids! :) Anyway, I love it.</li>
    <li> Great cutter only complaint would have been to have the on/off switch of higher quality material instead of the very cheap feeling plastic, but switch aside cutter has been great in terms of feel/quality/cut and adjustments. Hope it lasts forever, shall see...</li>
    <li> Amazing Quality and an amazing cut. I will never buy anything else again. These clippers are a workhorse and they are very good to you if you take care of them (oiling)</li>
    <li> Really nice clippers.  Really like the heavy, solid feel in my had, work great!</li>
    <li> Great clippers!!!  the cut smoothly and the blades are nice and sharp</li>
    <li> I love it. It is such a nice clipper. If you need one that you use every day I would suggest this one.</li>
    <li> Just what i&#x27;m looking for, this is a profesional clipper, a little bit heavier maybe, but when you turned on WOW! It really feels great in your hand, and trims really smooth.</li>
    <li> I am personally a huge wahl fan and the sterling reflections senior doesn&#x27;t disappoint at all comes with a v9000 motor witch cuts through anything like butter if used properly it gives you the smoothest transition in a fade</li>
    <li> I would recommend these to any one who does a lot of clipper cuts. the housing is durable and does get warm but using a silicone sleeve will eliminate that. very quiet</li>
    <li> i use to have wahl 2000 which sucked so i up graded to the reflections clipper and they work great! no issues so far.i really love that it comes with the guards especially 1/2 and 1 1/2 guard :)</li>
    <li> Hello,,the other reviews saying these are Great Clippers are correct. Quiet,,sharper than American Voters,,,oop&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Well,anyway I am glad I baught them.</li>
    <li> cord to short is cutting out when in it is on mat try another what can you do for me sorry james</li>
    <li> I love them except u have to adjust the blades in between each haircut they should come from the factory ready to go</li>
    <li> I remember using my dad&#x27;s Wahl professional 30 years ago.  It had some weight to it, you could feel the quality, and they didn&#x27;t yet make cheaper models you find in stores today for $20.  The Sterling feels and works like my dad&#x27;s model, smooth with that weight feeling. Although it has weight, it has an one-sided plastic cover where I thought they could have used aluminum/stainless. Not a show stopper but this isn&#x27;t that $300 clipper either but it does have the guts of one.  Should last 30 years.  Btw, my older brother is still using my dad&#x27;s Wahl professional to this day.</li>
    <li> Just like Andis Masters, but what&#x27;s great bout it is very light. Not heavy compared to Andis. Surgical blade of Reflections is amazing for them detailed fades...  And this is cheaper than Andis, great buy. Already on my 2nd one now that just ordered.</li>
    <li> nearly 2 years later and this is still my go to clipper at the shop</li>
    <li> My wife is a hair stylist and absolutely loves them. They are light weight durable easy to clear never bind and pull my hair when she cuts it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for haircuts for myself and my two sons. Hands down, the best clipper I have owned. Its sharp, quick and doesn&#x27;t make too much noise. I used to buy cheap $15 - $20 clippers from Wal-Mart and always ended up which inferior products. This clipper is worth the extra money. Its barber shop quality and built to last. Like any clippers though, you have to make sure it oiled and stored carefully.</li>
    <li> Been a hairdresser for 20 years...&amp; these are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve invested in....well worth the money</li>
    <li> Best of the line. Love wahl products for 25 years.</li>
    <li> As a professional hair stylist, I need something powerful and clean. This does just that. No need to go over areas more than once. One complaint is; it tends to vibrate pretty quickly which can make your hand feel like it&#x27;s about to go numb after repeated use in one day.</li>
    <li> They work great, look nice, fit in your hand well and cut great. Just make sure that you oil them after using them, or else they will start to chatter.</li>
    <li> Work great. My old ones were bullet proof and lasted for over a decade.</li>
    <li> I received in two days like it was promised.  Clippers were beautiful...I love the fade blade and chrome paint.  i Recommended these clippers to any barbers.</li>
    <li> Bought these for the hubby.  He really likes them and says they are easy to handle and provide a great cut.</li>
    <li> Love this! Perfect weight in hand cuts great in sure I&#x27;ll have it forever.</li>
    <li> tal cual como lo describi&amp;oacute; el vendedor totalmente satisfecho recomiendo a esta tienda muy buena atenci&amp;oacute;n excelente y llego rapido.</li>
    <li> These were recommended to my by my barber, they&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
    <li> the clipper is powerful, and it leaves my client with a smooth cut. I like the crome finish, power, and the over all feel</li>
    <li> My son is going to Barber School...he chose this item to be ordered (I just paid for it)</li>
