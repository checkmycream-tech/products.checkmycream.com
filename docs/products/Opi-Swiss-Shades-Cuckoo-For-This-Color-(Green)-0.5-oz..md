    <li> I love OPI products, and this color is no exception.  It looks exactly like picture; green and blue hues - like a peacock color.</li>
    <li> Nice color for winter..</li>
    <li> This green is to die for!!&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me of the rain forest.  It blends with everything.&lt;br /&gt;I challenge women to use this as a neutral color.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!</li>
    <li> Green was to light and had a shimmer I did not want!</li>
    <li> Love the colour, particularly on my toes! Quite opaque, but comes out a little lighter in colour on ( no question, it&#x27;s still green after a few coats). Looks quite metallic, but jewel-like, not like an oilslick.</li>
    <li> I loved this OPI dark green shade of nail polish! I am not one to prefer darker colors but this one has a bit of a sheen to it that I like. I gave it four stars because, of it&#x27;s quality, OPI is one of the best brands. I know that this color is long lasting reflecting its high quality since it lasted for about a week. I probably could have gotten this same nail polish cheaper from a store, however I wanted to this color immediately and so I paid more money for it here on Amazon.This would be great for anyone that enjoys wearing nail polish. I gave it four stars for it&#x27;s high quality, the nail polish I received is the same pictured, and because it&#x27;s a beautiful color.</li>

    <li> Love this color!  Timely delivery.</li>
    <li> Polish old and bubbles arises...</li>
    <li> OPI does it again!  This nailpolish lasted over 2 weeks on toenails with no chips at all.  It&#x27;s a pretty green-blue color-- I call that type of color peacock blue.  It&#x27;s darker than the picture.    I thought the nail polish might be too old and clumpy as a result.. but I had no problems with application.  I used a clear base coat because I was afraid of the dark color staining my nails.  With the base coat, I had no problems.  I used 2 coats of color with 30 minute dry time between coats (I do my nails while watching a movie dvd).  No top coat and no chips.    Just perfect!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites from OPI ,This is a beautiful green color ,last long without chipping and has a nice shine.Looks just like the picture!</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous color. I get tons of compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
