      <li>A great buy as well for the price.</li>
      <li>Awesome, really works.</li>
      <li>A must if you want to have nice looking heels for summer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve come to depend on this product to keep my feet smooth and smelling good even diabetics can use it.</li>
      <li>My father love this cream for his feets an legs, I was using before</li>
      <li>There are better products out there.</li>
      <li>And I have tried many - Eucerin, Lubriderm, Vaseline Intensive, etc, etc, etc.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this and won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this foot cream for many years now.  </li>
      <li>but I change for extra virgin coconut oil, works better for me, but is a really good cream for people with diabetes also.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find this all that great or better than any other foot cream you can buy out on the market.</li>
      <li>Definitely not a miracle cream, but does moisturize and has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about the smell</li>
      <li>The only thing I liked about this product was that large 8 ounce size.</li>
      <li>The first time i bought this product during the winter time, I almost used it every night before i go to sleep with my socks on.</li>
      <li>It really is a miracle repair cream!</li>
      <li>It keeps my feet very soft and with the aloe, cool.</li>
      <li>I buy this product a lot really helps keep my feet soft and free from calluses</li>
      <li>This product has nice scent but does not provide long lasting foot softening.</li>
      <li>So, as others have said, buy it from someone who honest up front -- you can get 8 oz for about the same price as this 4 oz from other Amazon sellers.</li>
      <li>I have never found a single issue with it, and it is amazing on dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Took off one star because ingredients are not as natural as one would want.</li>
      <li>This really does help very dry cracked feet.</li>
      <li>This is no better than many other hand and foot creams I have tried...</li>
      <li>probably no worse, but not worth any extra attention (or money).</li>

    <li> This has got to be the best foot cream out there.  I will purchase over and over again and again.</li>
    <li> This is no better than many other hand and foot creams I have tried...probably no worse, but not worth any extra attention (or money).</li>
    <li> I buy this product a lot really helps keep my feet soft and free from calluses</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Germany and as soon as it is possible for me to buy Foot Repair Cream I buy one. It is the best.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this and won&#x27;t be without it. It&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs into the skin well and does what it says it will do. A must if you want to have nice looking heels for summer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find this all that great or better than any other foot cream you can buy out on the market. Definitely not a miracle cream, but does moisturize and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This really does help very dry cracked feet. Took off one star because ingredients are not as natural as one would want.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, covers well and absorbs without being greasy. Not crazy about the smell but it dissapates rapidly. Does not seem slick in the shower the next day. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Miracle of Aloe whether foot or hand cream this stuff works wonders!  If your skin cracks, hurts, or itches, on your feet or hands you have to try the cream. A great buy as well for the price.</li>
    <li> This foot lotion is the best .</li>
    <li> The first time i bought this product during the winter time, I almost used it every night before i go to sleep with my socks on. The next day, i applied the cream after i took the morning shower.  I observed that there&#x27;s a big improvement after a week and my feet becomes softer and it removes bad odor!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I have used it for years.  Unfortunately this is only the 4oz size so way over-priced for this size - I can purchase the 8 oz size for this price!  Dissappointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this foot cream for many years now.  I have never found a single issue with it, and it is amazing on dry skin.  It really is a miracle repair cream!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve come to depend on this product to keep my feet smooth and smelling good even diabetics can use it.</li>
    <li> No miracles here for me...My feet are dry and prone to being crusty if not moisturized regularly. This product has nice scent but does not provide long lasting foot softening. I applied it after showering and using a pumice stone. I then put socks on and went to bed. My feet were softened a bit after a few days but quickly dried out after missing just one day of application. There are better products out there. The only thing I liked about this product was that large 8 ounce size.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best foot lotion I have ever tried. And I have tried many - Eucerin, Lubriderm, Vaseline Intensive, etc, etc, etc.  This works.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER: The picture from this seller shows 8 oz but the description says 4 oz.  They ship 4 oz.  So, as others have said, buy it from someone who honest up front -- you can get 8 oz for about the same price as this 4 oz from other Amazon sellers.</li>
