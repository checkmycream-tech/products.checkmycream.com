<li> They work well and were exactly what I was expecting minus one thing.</li>
<li> exactly what was described on site, did not experience any structural or material issues as mentioned in other comments (like bending and breaking).</li>
<li> These came in several weeks earlier than expected.</li>
<li> : After a few months, one of my round end got rusty; however, it was because after I used it, i didn&#x27;t clean and let it be wet.</li>
<li> I stopped doing that with my other ones and now after months i don&#x27;t have the same problem anymore.</li>
<li> cheap material, cheap wire loops, useless round cup ends, at least the sharp ends were sharp.</li>
<li> Also the round end is starting to bend just a tiny bit, doesn&#x27;t affect its uses though.     </li>
<li> i&#x27;ve searched for a very long time and finally came across this one, it has all the things I wanted, the sharp end and the different round ends.</li>
<li> Tools do not last long and the metal bends and breaks within just a few uses.</li>
<li> You have to really push hard on your skin to get a black head out.</li>
<li> Caution though they have extremly sharp edges</li>
<li> Took a while to get to my house and they&#x27;re all pretty useless.</li>
<li> so if you have little ones like I do..be careful with them.</li>
<li> Really going to a spa or beauty bar just gets to expensive these days.</li>
<li> It is very sharp and does the job without leaving a noticeable mark on your skin.</li>
<li> so the junk underneath can be pushed out with less resistance.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t recall reading size specifications but I wasn&#x27;t expecting then to be four inches long and maybe a 1/4 of an inch thick.</li>
<li> I usually try to use these once a week.</li>
<li> They are very thin and short.</li>
<li> He always had these hard knots under his skin on his cheeks.</li>
<li> this item made of bad quality, each end sides are not made properly, and it is useless when I try it, not recommended at all</li>
<li> I got them for my husband and can only say; yuck tons of crap are coming out of this cheeks.</li>
<li> Very poor quality.</li>
<li> , I don&#x27;t know why it starts to get the bad reviews, maybe the seller&#x27;s products got worse, or it was a bad batch.</li>
<li> Just didn&#x27;t seem to do the job and was painful to use.</li>
<li> It might hurt some (sometimes if you do it wrong), but it works like a charm!!!    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it a lot. had to look up directions on how to use it though.</li>
    <li> These tools are a must have when treating acne and blemishes. The sharp ends help to poke into the top of the pore so the junk underneath can be pushed out with less resistance. The rounded sides, once you figure out what works best for you when it comes to pushing, is very handy also. I leave them in a glass of alcohol to disinfect until the next use and nothing is rusty. It seems to be a very strong and durable metal.</li>
    <li> Wished this came with instructions but after looking it up online and figuring it out its a great product</li>
    <li> O holy lord they hurt....but work really well. My gf uses them on us both.</li>
    <li> Shipping was about twelve days. Work and are solid. Look like torture devices.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for the price!</li>
    <li> I was surprised that these really worked and the tips are truly needle points. These help with ingrown hairs and pimples.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my teenagers and they work really well. No scarring is the best perk. They are easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Also received them way ahead of schedule. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good quality tools, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These came in several weeks earlier than expected. They work well and were exactly what I was expecting minus one thing. They are very thin and short. I don&#x27;t recall reading size specifications but I wasn&#x27;t expecting then to be four inches long and maybe a 1/4 of an inch thick. I&#x27;ll see how they hold up in time and review again later.</li>
    <li> this item made of bad quality, each end sides are not made properly, and it is useless when I try it, not recommended at all</li>
    <li> Works great very useful in getting rid of black heads and  white headsvery easy to use. good quality instrument love these tools</li>
    <li> directions how to use would be nice</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t seem to do the job and was painful to use.</li>
    <li> The hook and point is great for removing milia. It is very sharp and does the job without leaving a noticeable mark on your skin.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Tools do not last long and the metal bends and breaks within just a few uses. Took longer to recieve than what was stated after the purchase.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price but wow, I could have paid over $20 and would still consider it a bargain.  The set is made with good quality metal. I highly recommend the set.</li>
    <li> This product works as it should and is a great value. It makes a great addition to my collection of grooming tools.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get to my house and they&#x27;re all pretty useless. Unless you&#x27;re using on pimples the size of nerds candies, these won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> So much easier than pinching and trying to tweeze!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I&#x27;m starting to do my own facials and steams at home. Really going to a spa or beauty bar just gets to expensive these days. I usually try to use these once a week. The only thing I noticed is they came from China. If I knew they were coming from there directly...wouldn&#x27;t have purchased them I made sure put them over heat to kill any bacteria and used rubbing alcohol before using them. You really should do that each time you use them. Caution though they have extremly sharp edges I even scratched myself..so if you have little ones like I do..be careful with them.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, no problems..</li>
    <li> Simple and easy way to rid both blackheads and ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> Great for the purpose.</li>
    <li> exactly what was described on site, did not experience any structural or material issues as mentioned in other comments (like bending and breaking). one of the 2 pointy tools had a bent tip, can probably be fixed with a bit of work though.</li>
    <li> I use these very carefully to extract and keep my skin in great condition.  Part of my continual regiment.</li>
    <li> The tools help with acne removal but sometimes they don&#x27;t get all the junk out of your pores and you still have to squeeze them. But they do reduce the pain and help with extraction. Worth the investment if your work environment causes acne problems.</li>
    <li> Much better than using your fingernails.</li>
    <li> This is a very useful product and i would definately recomend it to anyone who may want to use it.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price and fast shipping! i&#x27;ve searched for a very long time and finally came across this one, it has all the things I wanted, the sharp end and the different round ends. I&#x27;ve used this for a month now and it didn&#x27;t bend or break. I use soap to wash them and hazel witch or rubbing alcohol to disinfect them. I Youtubed how to use these and once i got the hang of it, omg it works wonderful!!! better than q-tips or bobby pins; however sometimes its easier to use hand, BUT that is not sanitary. It might hurt some (sometimes if you do it wrong), but it works like a charm!!!    Tips: Wipe your face with witch hazel before using it. Also wash your hands.     Update: After a few months, one of my round end got rusty; however, it was because after I used it, i didn&#x27;t clean and let it be wet. After many times like that I guess it got rusty. I stopped doing that with my other ones and now after months i don&#x27;t have the same problem anymore. Also the round end is starting to bend just a tiny bit, doesn&#x27;t affect its uses though.     I bought this when there was only like 5 reviews and they were all good, I don&#x27;t know why it starts to get the bad reviews, maybe the seller&#x27;s products got worse, or it was a bad batch. Either I do reccomend this. Its a good price.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed I had gotten one at Avon that I lost and I saw them at sephora for over $10. So these are great they do the job received fast happy with purchase</li>
    <li> These tools get the job done!</li>
    <li> love this 4 in 1. nice quality. i would definitely buy another one!</li>
    <li> I love this tool!!!  It make it real easy to get your piles and blackheads.  It doesn&#x27;t cut you or scar you like it will when u use use finger.</li>
    <li> Came quickly. As represented.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work well. You have to really push hard on your skin to get a black head out. Then you leave a mark on your skin</li>
    <li> Excellent set. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> junk, you get what you pay for. cheap material, cheap wire loops, useless round cup ends, at least the sharp ends were sharp. get a nice one from a local store like walmart or target, the metal is smooth and finished and not just a wire loop stuck into a rough tin stick.</li>
    <li> These are great. I got them for my husband and can only say; yuck tons of crap are coming out of this cheeks. He always had these hard knots under his skin on his cheeks. They weren&#x27;t  visible to the eye but you could feel them. After using the extractor they are gone.</li>
