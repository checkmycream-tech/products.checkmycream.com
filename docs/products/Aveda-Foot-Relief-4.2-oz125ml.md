<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Great smell and works well for keeping feet soft.  So happy I can get it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to be by a friend after my foot surgery and i have no regrets. Keeps my feet supple with a great aroma. Non greasy too. Liked the product so much i ordered a bigger size for keeps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for many years so I knew of its benefits before ordering it online.  It really moistures feet and feels great!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing in bringing relief to tired, sore, and/or hurting feet from many causes beginning with its pleasant aroma.  I&#x27;ve used this foot cream for years and have yet to find another remedy as effective or with such lasting results, including a specially compounded prescription ointment from my podiatrist.  Although the cream comes out of the tube thick, it is easily spread onto the surface areas of the foot; rub/massage in well for quick and complete absorption without any &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; residue.  If I believed in &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;, this is it!  What&#x27;s interesting about this foot cream is the beneficial impact from the first application; repeated use will bring even greater relief.  I recommend Aveda Foot Relief without reservation or hesitation.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time during the day on my feet, so taking care of them is important. Although it is expensive, I haven&#x27;t found any foot cream that works as well as this on dry feet.</li>
    <li> This purchase was a gift.  The recipient was happy with it.  It arrived&lt;br /&gt;in good time.</li>
    <li> This foot cream really is fabulous. It was used on me by a manicurist recently, and I felt the stress just leave my feet. Very relaxing. I live in AZ and we have very hard water. My skin dries out but my feet in particular, get ridiculously dry, to the point where it hurts my heels to walk. This cream offers immediate relief and keeps my feet soft and moisturized for hours. I love the smell and the way it feels on my feet; you can feel a tingling when applied. Only downside: the price.  That&#x27;s why I couldn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Being a diabetic, I have to take extra care of my feet. This cream makes my feet feel really good and keeps them in great shape! It makes taking care of my feet a pleasure!</li>
    <li> This foot lotion is great, just like the hand lotion. You will not have dry hands or feet if you use these lotion products for a determined amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I really don&#x27;t like the peppermint smell. That is never a smell that I was to wear. I usually just use the hand lotion on my feet because I think the smell is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Best foot cream ever - I am so glad my BEST friend told me about it. My feet love it!!</li>
    <li> My mom loves it.  She got cracked skin on her heels, the lotion reliefs her sufferings in dryness.  This is the fourth one i have bought for her.</li>
    <li> OK odor.  Good foot cream.</li>
    <li> Great foot cream ...this is the third tube that I have purchased... a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I love this product! I had a small tube (about 3oz) that I purchased at an Aveda store once and just fell in love with it.</li>
    <li> This product is really nice and a favorite of mine. I recommend to anyone who needs some foot relief and comfort!</li>
    <li> I had actually purchased this when I had a pedicure at a salon.  It feels so good on your feet, and you can feel the moisture absorbing. It is the absolute best foot cream that I have ever used before.  I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foot cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It smooths even the most terrible feet and callouses - even my fiance&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and takes out stress and tension with my feet and its a good foot relief.  I even put the lotion further up my legs before I sleep and makes me even sleep very good. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have foot problems and have tried many different products. This blows the other foot lotions out of the water! It is thick and creamy, creates a pleasant tingling sensation in your feet, and is great for foot massages. Perfect for sore feet.</li>
    <li> I am a long term user of this product and it is amazing as always!!  If you use this product as instructed you will have great results.&lt;br /&gt;The price paid here is the same as the Aveda site, but prefer to shop here:) Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for keeping feet soft.</li>
    <li> A SPA in a lotion for my feet. OMG the best for the price considering what you&#x27;ll pay at an Aveda store or other store for a smaller size. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing and does a great job smoothing rough and dry feet. I try to apply it every night, especially during the colder months. Like all Aveda products, it&#x27;s all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend buying it here. I usually by directly from Aveda and it&#x27;s definitely cheaper.</li>
    <li> My favorite foot cream.  Arrived promptly.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Not up to my expectations.  You can do better with Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Cream.  Although the minty part of this lotion was nice, it did not moisturize particularly well.</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to work better than the rest, unk why.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best foot cream out there.  I got a sample as a christmas gift and I was sold.  Just a little and your feet will feel like cotton....well worth it</li>
    <li> Excellent results, a strong frangrance.</li>
    <li> Always surprises me with the quality</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!! It works beautifully and had a soothing eucalyptus smell. I highly recommend this product and site!</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, I use a small amount as a hand cream just before bed (lol). It moisturizes &amp; exfoliates. Much cheaper directly from an Aveda store.</li>
    <li> This stuff is to die for! Smells wonderful, works well, and I will never use another foot cream. Heard the hand lotion is just as good.</li>
    <li> Best foot product I have ever used. Once after shower in the morning and once before bed. Perfect feet no cracks or rough spots.</li>
    <li> I am a triathlete so it is important for me to keep my feet healthy plus my feet are the softest in my family  I use this product daily.</li>
    <li> I really like the Aveda Foot Relief for rubbing my wife&#x27;s feet. It makes it easier to give a foot massage, because the lubrication makes my hands move easier. The smell is very relaxing (I think it&#x27;s lavender). If your wife&#x27;s feet are happy, your wife is happy, and that is a wonderful thing!</li>
