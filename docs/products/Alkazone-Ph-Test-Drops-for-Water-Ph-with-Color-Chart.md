### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These drops work great!</li>
      <li>This tester kit worked perfectly for the demonstration.  </li>
      <li>we&#x27;re prompt and flawless.    </li>
      <li>For the intended purpose of my purchase, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied!  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t use this test and say with certainty, \\&quot;the water has a pH of 4.5\\&quot;; rather, with this test, you&#x27;re more apt to say,</li>
      <li>- I bought this test to make sure I get the water&#x27;s pH to a desired level.  </li>
      <li>I love being able to test water to see how alkaline it is.  </li>
      <li>drops\\&quot; to my bottled water to make it slightly more alkaline.)</li>
      <li>it just worked perfectly for this specific use.</li>
      <li>Plenty of liquid for many tests.</li>
      <li>I am able to judge the ph of the water easily.  </li>
      <li>Works ok but not alot of detailed scale of colors so can&#x27;t do preceise measurmenbt of ph</li>
      <li>Easy to read results.  </li>
      <li>The quality is fine, but the flacons came half-empty, which makes  them costly.</li>
      <li>Nice hat, somewhat large</li>
      <li>It was too light.  </li>
      <li>and 8.\\&quot; You really have to rely on your own eyes to \\&quot;estimate\\&quot;</li>
      <li>but good for general idea of your ph.</li>
      <li>But if you only need a good approximation - this test is just fine.</li>
      <li>I bought this test to get a good idea of the pH of the water that gets piped into my home, as well as to test the bottled water I purchase from local grocery stores.  </li>
      <li>And i am not even sure whether this thing is accurate because unfiltered water and filtered water shows just about if not the same pH level!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so satisfied with this product that I could have given it 5 stars: the only reason I didn&#x27;t is that this test doesn&#x27;t yield a precise, numerical pH.</li>
      <li>I have been quite satisfied with the performance and the general accuracy of this test.    </li>
      <li>I was very exited!    </li>
      <li>Most likely, you can also use this testing solution to test the pH of water that is the product of your home filtration system.     </li>
      <li>When asked to have it returned, was slapped with rude email and demanded to return it with my own cost of shipment and 15% restock charge, shipping is non-refundable!</li>
      <li>pH.     This test works well as long as there aren&#x27;t too many dissolved substances in the water: if the water sample is too saturated with dissolved solids, the test will not work.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re absolutely in need of a definite, precise reading with a very low margin-of-error - or if you have high expectations about being able to say with certainty, \\&quot;This water has a pH of 7.2\\&quot; - you&#x27;re likely better served in purchasing a pH meter.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>The value of the produce is  over priced...too damn much.</li>
      <li>I was rather surprised that water from the alkalizer filter would test alkaline when it is fresh, but after sitting for a few hours or overnight, it went more acid?  </li>
      <li>However, this little bottle will yield you MANY tests - in my estimation, it will yield well over 100 tests.  </li>
      <li>, the cheapest store brand water was nearly alkaline and the more expensive the water, the more acidic it was.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this kit and anxiously awaited its arrival, so I could video tape a demonstration of just how acidic most tap and bottled waters are.  </li>
      <li>And since I&#x27;ve had desires to manipulate the pH of the water I use (I add a small amount of ascorbic acid to a gallon of tap water to make it more acidic, then use it as a hair rinse.  </li>
      <li>I sprinkled a new natural dietary product into each sample and they all turned deep purple (pH of 10.5+) within seconds.  </li>
      <li>Anyone following health and nutrition these days knows the vital role that pH balance plays in the body.  </li>
      <li>Chart\\&quot; that is provided - the number on the chart that appears below the color that the sample most closely matches is its approximate</li>

<li> That said - from my experience, the test works well for tap water, bottled spring water, bottled distilled water (although you may be shocked at how acidic distilled water that&#x27;s been sitting in a plastic jug can become!); and the above-mentioned waters with a small amount of a pH-altering substance added.  </li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it would look like something people make it in garage. The liquid is half a bottle (tumb size), no seal on the bottle, no label of what they made from, just said &#x27;pH Indicator&#x27;. When asked to have it returned, was slapped with rude email and demanded to return it with my own cost of shipment and 15% restock charge, shipping is non-refundable!</li>
    <li> I ordered this kit and anxiously awaited its arrival, so I could video tape a demonstration of just how acidic most tap and bottled waters are.  Anyone following health and nutrition these days knows the vital role that pH balance plays in the body.  This tester kit worked perfectly for the demonstration.  Added 2 drops to 3 oz. of water and stirred per the instructions.  The water changed color almost instantly.  I compared my tap water to four bottles purchased at the store.  Wouldn&#x27;t you know it, the cheapest store brand water was nearly alkaline and the more expensive the water, the more acidic it was.  I sprinkled a new natural dietary product into each sample and they all turned deep purple (pH of 10.5+) within seconds.  I was very exited!    It is a very small bottle, but the dropper is tiny too, so two drops hardly uses any.  The color chart is a heavy plasticized paper.  Ordering and shipping we&#x27;re prompt and flawless.    For the intended purpose of my purchase, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied!  Keep in mind that I&#x27;ve never used any other pH tester kit, so I have no basis for comparison... it just worked perfectly for this specific use.</li>
    <li> Did just what we needed it to do. Plenty of liquid for many tests. Size is small but it does not take much for a test.</li>
    <li> I bought this test to get a good idea of the pH of the water that gets piped into my home, as well as to test the bottled water I purchase from local grocery stores.  And since I&#x27;ve had desires to manipulate the pH of the water I use (I add a small amount of ascorbic acid to a gallon of tap water to make it more acidic, then use it as a hair rinse.  And sometimes, I add \\&quot;pH drops\\&quot; to my bottled water to make it slightly more alkaline.) - I bought this test to make sure I get the water&#x27;s pH to a desired level.  I have been quite satisfied with the performance and the general accuracy of this test.    As I just pointed out elsewhere on this site - the bottle of testing solution is quite small - about a third of an ounce (the exact quantity isn&#x27;t listed on the bottle - but comparing it to a 1 ounce bottle, it appears to be somewhere around this size).  However, this little bottle will yield you MANY tests - in my estimation, it will yield well over 100 tests.  The way this test is run is as follows:  you measure out 3 ounces of the water you want to test, then add two drops of solution to this 3-ounce sample of water.  Stir the sample well; the sample will change to a color that is indicative of its pH.  Compare the color of the sample to the \\&quot;Color Chart\\&quot; that is provided - the number on the chart that appears below the color that the sample most closely matches is its approximate pH.     This test works well as long as there aren&#x27;t too many dissolved substances in the water: if the water sample is too saturated with dissolved solids, the test will not work.  That said - from my experience, the test works well for tap water, bottled spring water, bottled distilled water (although you may be shocked at how acidic distilled water that&#x27;s been sitting in a plastic jug can become!); and the above-mentioned waters with a small amount of a pH-altering substance added.  Most likely, you can also use this testing solution to test the pH of water that is the product of your home filtration system.     I&#x27;m so satisfied with this product that I could have given it 5 stars: the only reason I didn&#x27;t is that this test doesn&#x27;t yield a precise, numerical pH. You can&#x27;t use this test and say with certainty, \\&quot;the water has a pH of 4.5\\&quot;; rather, with this test, you&#x27;re more apt to say, \\&quot;the pH of the water is AROUND 4.5\\&quot;, or \\&quot;the pH of the water is somewhere between 7 and 8.\\&quot; You really have to rely on your own eyes to \\&quot;estimate\\&quot; the approximate pH (colorblind people may have problems with this test). If you&#x27;re absolutely in need of a definite, precise reading with a very low margin-of-error - or if you have high expectations about being able to say with certainty, \\&quot;This water has a pH of 7.2\\&quot; - you&#x27;re likely better served in purchasing a pH meter.  But if you only need a good approximation - this test is just fine.</li>
    <li> Nice hat, somewhat large</li>
    <li> These drops work, just like they are supposed to.  I have tested tap water and water from our filters and just about every other liquid I could get my hands on in the kitchen.  I was rather surprised that water from the alkalizer filter would test alkaline when it is fresh, but after sitting for a few hours or overnight, it went more acid?  Anyone have any further information about this phenomena?</li>
    <li> Do not purchase the drops.  They are very expensive and the little tiny bottle the drops come in is only half full.  So, there is maybe only enough liquid to test twice.</li>
    <li> I am able to judge the ph of the water easily.  I am a big fan of this and will have to buy it again as I am running out.</li>
    <li> It works well enough.  It is just after I bought this I found out the alkaline diet is bunk.  No truth in it.</li>
    <li> The pricing is ridiculous for a \\&quot;crack vile\\&quot;!! And i am not even sure whether this thing is accurate because unfiltered water and filtered water shows just about if not the same pH level!! You can hardly tell the difference!!</li>
    <li> Works ok but not alot of detailed scale of colors so can&#x27;t do preceise measurmenbt of ph but good for general idea of your ph.</li>
    <li> Adding the recommended number of drops to each sample produced a color that was difficult to compare to the chart.  It was too light.  I doubt the accuracy of this product since I tested it on substances which were obviously acidic and it showed different results.</li>
    <li> The quality is fine, but the flacons came half-empty, which makes  them costly.</li>
    <li> I love being able to test water to see how alkaline it is.  Easy to read results.  These drops work great!</li>
    <li> I got this to test the ph of the water I was drinking and to also test water I made alkaline.  Works like it should.</li>
    <li> The drops are just what I wanted.  Thank you so much. I will order them again when I need to.</li>
    <li> I returned the product and did get a refund.  The colors did not match the PH chart and the amount in the very small bottle would not give you the stated amount of tests.</li>
    <li> It works...for $19.99 or .30Cents a drop, it betterf work The value of the produce is  over priced...too damn much.</li>
