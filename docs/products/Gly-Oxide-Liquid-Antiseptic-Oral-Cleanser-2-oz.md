    <li> I began using Glyoxide as a mouth rinse when I was in my mid-teens. My wisdom teeth were often irritated as they came in, and I adamantly refused (and still do) to have them removed. Glyoxide has helped me keep my wisdom teeth clean and irritation-free for more than 15 years. Every time I go to the dentist, the hygienists compliment me on my clean, tarter-free teeth. They are shocked to hear that I rarely floss my teeth. My secret...Glyoxide!</li>
    <li> I use this daily.  It&#x27;s helped a lot contain gum problems I had before.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works great for sore gums or canker sores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to address occasional gum irritations.  It is really a life saver.  In fact I have recommended this product to friends who have had minor gum problems.  Of course, if you have major gum issues you should visit a doctor or dentist but in the interim this product is very effective.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Have been using this product for a few years and have never been disappointed in its use.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> mouth sores or irritations disappear after 2 or 3 applications...  It&#x27;s great !!!</li>
    <li> I use this product after brushing my teeth, for an extra clean feeling in the morning and just before bedtime.</li>
    <li> great product. love it.  just what I needed.  couldn&#x27;t ask for better.  worth every penny.  best of the best. perfect.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this product in this size. Some drugstores carry it in a much smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this mouth rinse for years. It was suggested for a relative in the 1970&#x27;s as a treatment for mouth sores. I use it as an supplement to teethbrushing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister who has a problem with lack of saliva. She says it helps.</li>
    <li> Nice to mix in with toms toothpaste to get an antiseptic advantage, working well</li>
    <li> It woks well  for me as an occasional rinse. A friend recommended it when I told her I was paying the dentist for a bleeding gum treatment at every cleaning. The bleeding stopped when I started the rinse..</li>
    <li> I have been using this ever since I got dry mouth.  It helps keep down bad breath and tooth decay.  Five stars. I always order it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My ex-husband is a doctor, who suffered with bad canker sores.  This product was his favorite to relieve pain and hasten healing.  It tastes sweet.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product to me for canker sores in my mouth. I have been using it for over 20 years.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for mouth sores, just squirt a little in and swish around and it clears them up in a few days. Really good stuff.</li>
    <li> This works great on mouth sores such as canker sores &amp; cold sores.  Try it.  You&#x27;ll like it!&lt;br /&gt;it has a peroxide base to it.</li>
    <li> Time tested and good product. Good to keep around.</li>
