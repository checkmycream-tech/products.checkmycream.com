### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>The unit pictured is identical to a unit we bought (and loved!)</li>
      <li>It has never lost power while using and its great for Beards, Mustache, Ear and Nose trimming.</li>
      <li>Great price, great product....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many trimmers before, but this one works the best.</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>I think one of the best thing I like about this trimmer is that I can replace the batteries anytime I want , come with all extra parts , so far very happy</li>
      <li>I, personally, enjoy being able to add batteries to it</li>
      <li>Trimmer works better then the original Conair trimmer it replaced.  </li>
      <li>easy to use ..</li>
      <li>Great trimmer for a regular traveller, as you don&#x27;t have to carry a charger around.</li>
      <li>The nose hair trimmer isnt so great, but I didnt really expect too much for this price.</li>
      <li>Work great - better than my previous &amp;#34;3 battery&amp;#34; Conair trimmer</li>
      <li>This product does the job very right.</li>
      <li>When the 5 Position attachment comb  is on the blade, it cuts short to some good extent, but I wanted to make my beard even shorter, so I removed the comb from the blade and ran the trimmer without the comb on my beard.</li>
      <li>Was very pleased with how well this did the job and was much quieter than the old one.</li>
      <li>If you just want something simple and easy to use for occasional beard trimming, this product is great.</li>
      <li>Pretty powerful for a battery-run item like this.</li>
      <li>Also, the 1-piece adjustable guide is better than having several to keep track of.</li>
      <li>This was exactly the one that my husband wanted.</li>
      <li>It really works well!</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it a 4 is that it indicated the item was new, however it did not come in a box and/or carton of any kind.</li>
      <li>Cuts well and fast.</li>
      <li>very satisfactory results.</li>
      <li>but that feature really was not viable after a year (8+yrs ago), and</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s ready when I am.</li>
      <li>Works VERY well for the price.</li>
      <li>Works off of two batteries making it much easier to use instead of having to charge it.  </li>
      <li>My favorite feature is that you can use a rubber band to &#x27;lock down&#x27; the on/off switch to prevent this trimmer from accidentally turning on inside your luggage.</li>
      <li>I love conair beard trimmers i owned a black pair just like the ones shown on the picture that i had for about three years now</li>
      <li>in all we highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
      <li>For the dollars spent (and saved), it&#x27;s a tremendous value!</li>
      <li>so we wanted to get a new one before the model changed</li>
      <li>However it did appear new and had all the components.</li>
      <li>but when i order something i expect to get exactly what i ordered they need to update their picture to show exactly what you are getting instead of fooling me to thinking im getting one thing and recieve something else, other than that the clippers work well for now</li>
      <li>Bought this to replace an old Conair Beard Trimmer that had worked for many years but was getting dull.</li>
      <li>so i wanted to order another pair exactly like the ones i had before because they served me well for so long</li>
      <li>Then I could use another shaver in order to shave my beard completely.</li>
      <li>This is a reliable unit - in fact the only reason we bought a new one now is the battery compartment on the old one was having problems staying on</li>
      <li>&quot; but they never seem to work very well for very long.</li>
      <li>The metal part gets very hot after a few minutes of use.</li>

<li> This product actually helped I shave completly,otherwise I had trouble shaving my thick beard with the regular shaver, meaning the regular shaver when the beard is thick,not only causes pulling of the beard,but also the blades get quickly damaged, and dull,  and this beard trimmer can cut the long beard to a very short beard, shaveable for the regular shaver.</li>

    <li> easy to use .. but did not work for me ... its clunky ... the hair gets caught in the blades easily .. and its just too weak :(</li>
    <li> This product does the job very right.I had long beard, then decided to make it short.When the 5 Position attachment comb  is on the blade, it cuts short to some good extent, but I wanted to make my beard even shorter, so I removed the comb from the blade and ran the trimmer without the comb on my beard. very satisfactory results.Then I could use another shaver in order to shave my beard completely.This product actually helped I shave completly,otherwise I had trouble shaving my thick beard with the regular shaver, meaning the regular shaver when the beard is thick,not only causes pulling of the beard,but also the blades get quickly damaged, and dull,  and this beard trimmer can cut the long beard to a very short beard, shaveable for the regular shaver.</li>
    <li> This product works fantastically! I&#x27;ve had many trimmers before, but this one works the best. I, personally, enjoy being able to add batteries to it so it&#x27;s ready when I am. I have had the kinds before where they \\&quot;charge,\\&quot; but they never seem to work very well for very long. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I would recommend it to anyone who needs to trim their beards, mustaches, etc... on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> after just a few months ,even with new batters, the beard trimmer runs weak.  It is on it way out !  The metal part gets very hot after a few minutes of use.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product....I actually bought this as a trimmer for my dog Bandit, who is a Chinese Crested. It really works well!</li>
    <li> I returned this product because it was not the unit that was shown in the picture. The seller did refund my purchase amount and said they were changing the picture but as I write this the same picture is still displayed. I cannot rate the trimmer because I never used it.</li>
    <li> The model that shipped is a slightly newer model than the unit pictured.  The unit pictured is identical to a unit we bought (and loved!) about 5 or 6 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has used this trimmer (or it&#x27;s older brother) for all his beard and mustache trims the past half dozen years or so. The batteries last a reliable length of time and the blades remain sharp.  This is a reliable unit - in fact the only reason we bought a new one now is the battery compartment on the old one was having problems staying on so we wanted to get a new one before the model changed (looks like we&#x27;re a bit late on that goal.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all we highly recommend this trimmer. For the dollars spent (and saved), it&#x27;s a tremendous value!</li>
    <li> Bought this about 6 months ago. I use it about once a week and have never replaced the batteries. Works VERY well for the price. The nose hair trimmer isnt so great, but I didnt really expect too much for this price.</li>
    <li> This thing does the job and does it well. Can&#x27;t beat it at $15. If you just want something simple and easy to use for occasional beard trimming, this product is great. It uses batteries, so if you trim a lot then expect to change out the batteries once per month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle, small enough to travel with, and has numerous trimming attachments. Very pleased. Not a 5 Star because of battery life.</li>
    <li> Pretty powerful for a battery-run item like this. Cuts well and fast.</li>

My favorite feature is that you can use a rubber band to &#x27;lock down&#x27; the on/off switch to prevent this trimmer from accidentally turning on inside your luggage. Also, the 1-piece adjustable guide is better than having several to keep track of.</li>
    <li> I love conair beard trimmers i owned a black pair just like the ones shown on the picture that i had for about three years now and the blades finally dulled on me so i wanted to order another pair exactly like the ones i had before because they served me well for so long but when they arrived it was a totally different model thats silver, not a huge deal but when i order something i expect to get exactly what i ordered they need to update their picture to show exactly what you are getting instead of fooling me to thinking im getting one thing and recieve something else, other than that the clippers work well for now</li>
    <li> This little guy is a \\&quot;beaver\\&quot;, works like my electric beard trimmer, but I don&#x27;t mess with the cord or charging. I travel for 2 to 4 weeks at a time and look scruffy after a while. I wanted a battery operated trimmer, and also wished to use my rechargable AA batteries. This little beard buzzzz-saw is no slouch, I like it. My other trimmer was a rechargeable, ... but that feature really was not viable after a year (8+yrs ago), and I there-after I used it with the cord attached. So, I&#x27;ve donated my other beard trimmer to Goodwill and will go forward with a rechargeable battery trimmer. Whoopie! I&#x27;m no longer tethered and can dance and trim at the same time. ha</li>
    <li> Work great - better than my previous &amp;#34;3 battery&amp;#34; Conair trimmer</li>
    <li> I think one of the best thing I like about this trimmer is that I can replace the batteries anytime I want , come with all extra parts , so far very happy</li>
    <li> Trimmer works better then the original Conair trimmer it replaced.  Works off of two batteries making it much easier to use instead of having to charge it.  It has never lost power while using and its great for Beards, Mustache, Ear and Nose trimming.</li>
