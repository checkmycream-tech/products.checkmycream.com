### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful for winter.</li>
      <li>This one is totally awesome.  </li>
      <li>This a great lip balm!  </li>
      <li>The best product from Elizabeth Arden.</li>
      <li>Best lip protectant EVER!</li>
      <li>Incredible lightness of being:  </li>
      <li>The EA 8 hour cream lip protectant stick works great summer or winter.</li>
      <li>I use Carmex (both jar and tube types) and Burt&#x27;s Bee, and I must say they work as great at a fraction of the price.  </li>
      <li>This is a very nice product that conditions and protects your lips, feels good and looks good too.</li>
      <li>I am forever looking for a good chapstick.  </li>
      <li>Love the neutral color (my husband will even use this!).</li>
      <li>Tube cream slides on the lips beautifully and lightly</li>
      <li>Amazing, 100% repurchase</li>
      <li>So here is my honest opinion ...</li>
      <li>It makes my lips feel very smooth and protected from the sun.  </li>
      <li>Have been using it for many years.</li>
      <li>More is better:  </li>
      <li>I love this product and use it around my eyes also.</li>
      <li>I love all Elizabeth Arden products.</li>
      <li>so glad I can get it here.</li>
      <li>The pictures shows the lip protectant in a plastic case with &amp;#34;8&amp;#34;s on it; mine was plain--and, to top it off, it had two cracks on the case.  </li>
      <li>The stick is thicker and slathers on more like chapstick.  </li>
      <li>I have used this lip cream for many years.</li>
      <li>You can use the 8 Hour Cream Tube for more than lips.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more of this product !!!</li>
      <li>The best lip protective available and worth the higher price.  </li>
      <li>most often I buy from Amazon first !!</li>
      <li>My order arrived very quickly and packaging is intact.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for the 9 Hour Cream Lip Protectant, since I had purchased the 8-Hour Cream in a tube and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Have been using this product since the 90s and it smooth, protect and moisture lips.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite lip moisturizer!  </li>
      <li>I like this far better than most lip balms as it is not waxy and goes on evenly - just like applying lipstick.</li>
      <li>I like the feel of this on my mouth, it&#x27;s not as waxy as chapstick and gives a nice shine, so it can be worn just by itself for a natural look.</li>
      <li>It is by far the best product for dry lips.</li>
      <li>It works, but nothing extraordinary here.</li>
      <li>It does the job but does it worth the money?  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled to see it now comes in a lipstick style for my personal use.</li>
      <li>Not what I expected, not as good as what I bought at Arden counter.</li>
      <li>Is it worth the steep price tag?</li>
      <li>I mostly use it as a primer for some of my lipsticks that are a little more drying.</li>
      <li>My lips are dry and this product makes me comfortable and helps me easily apply lipstick.</li>
      <li>you simply get more of it.  </li>
      <li>Not perfect but best out there.</li>
      <li>Second, I think that the Tube is superior in several ways: 1)</li>
      <li>To be fair this product claimed to be SPF 15, but I am not sure why you need to put sunblock on your lips.  </li>
      <li>It smelled and very dry.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I really do like this product.</li>
      <li>As a primer, I wait several seconds after I apply it before putting on lipstick, otherwise the lipstick will slide right off!</li>
      <li>I think the product was old.</li>
      <li>I buy this product repeatedly but from this seller does not seem to be authentic - is a lighter color and different texture from usual.</li>
      <li>Over the last 20 years I have purchased nearly every lip product on the market under $40.</li>

    <li> I am forever looking for a good chapstick.  This one is totally awesome.  Not perfect but best out there.</li>

    <li> Best lip protectant EVER! Wonderful for winter. Lasts at least 6 hours, sometimes longer! I will be stocking up on this product and gifting to anyone with dry lips! Does not cause lip irritation or chapping like some other lip protectants I have tried. Love the neutral color (my husband will even use this!). Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I buy this product repeatedly but from this seller does not seem to be authentic - is a lighter color and different texture from usual.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, not as good as what I bought at Arden counter.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for the 9 Hour Cream Lip Protectant, since I had purchased the 8-Hour Cream in a tube and loved it.  Here&#x27;s my frustration with the lip stick protectant.  First, be wary of sellers on Amazon.  I received this product without its packaging.  The pictures shows the lip protectant in a plastic case with &amp;#34;8&amp;#34;s on it; mine was plain--and, to top it off, it had two cracks on the case.  This made me wonder if the product was a knock off.  Second, I think that the Tube is superior in several ways: 1) More is better:  you simply get more of it.  A 50ml tube cost me $16.39.  The stick gives you 0.13 oz for 12.99. I does the extra SPF 15 protection warrant the cost of the stick?  2) Incredible lightness of being:  Tube cream slides on the lips beautifully and lightly--just a little dab makes your lips shiny like gloss.  The stick is thicker and slathers on more like chapstick.  I prefer the lightness of the cream in the tube, since most of the time, one wears it as a base for lipstick. 3) Flexibility:  You can use the 8 Hour Cream Tube for more than lips.  Recently, I used it for a cut on a finger that I recently acquired from gardening.  If I were to purchase one or the other, I&#x27;d go for the Tube.  And if I had to buy the 8 Hour Cream Lip Protectant on a stick...I just wouldn&#x27;t.  It seems like a marketing gimmick to me, just another version of the same thing that you get less of but in a clever package.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 50 years!  I recommend this to any and everyone.  It is by far the best product for dry lips.</li>
    <li> I have used this lip cream for many years. My lips are dry and this product makes me comfortable and helps me easily apply lipstick.</li>
    <li> The EA 8 hour cream lip protectant stick works great summer or winter. Along with my dry skin comes dry lips so I have this lip protector with me at all times. Eight hours of protection is pushing it a bit - I usually apply as needed throughout the day. I like this far better than most lip balms as it is not waxy and goes on evenly - just like applying lipstick. And it has no taste - which I also like.</li>
    <li> LOVE-LOVE the Lip Fix products and most often I buy from Amazon first !!</li>
    <li> The best lip protective available and worth the higher price.  Have been using it for many years.</li>
    <li> Over the last 20 years I have purchased nearly every lip product on the market under $40. I&#x27;m serious. All of them. So here is my honest opinion ... meh. It works, but nothing extraordinary here. I&#x27;ve gotten the same results from Carmex and paid a lot less. So does it work? Yup. Is it worth the steep price tag? Nope.</li>
    <li> Threw it away after two uses.</li>
    <li> The best product from Elizabeth Arden.</li>
    <li> I think the product was old. It smelled and very dry.&lt;br /&gt;There was no way to contact the retailer.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will buy anything from this retailer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item per a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  It does the job but does it worth the money?  I use Carmex (both jar and tube types) and Burt&#x27;s Bee, and I must say they work as great at a fraction of the price.  Also this stick is a bit shorter than I expected.  A standard Burt&#x27;s Bee lip balm is 4.25g and a Carmex  tube is 10g.  This product is 3.7g.  To be fair this product claimed to be SPF 15, but I am not sure why you need to put sunblock on your lips.  I figure a majority of the price was the cost of advertisement and for the brand name.  Well I have paid the price to satisfy my curiosity and now I have the peace of mind to go back to Carmex and Burt&#x27;s Bee.</li>
    <li> My order arrived very quickly and packaging is intact.  Have been using this product since the 90s and it smooth, protect and moisture lips.  My routine is to wear it before wearing any color lip gloss or lip stick. Never have chapped lips.  In case you forget to bring sun screen, rub some on the tip of noise, cheekbone and forehead for temporarily protection in the sun.  Works wonder. Will keep buying this.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube so I really do like this product. I mostly use it as a primer for some of my lipsticks that are a little more drying. I like the feel of this on my mouth, it&#x27;s not as waxy as chapstick and gives a nice shine, so it can be worn just by itself for a natural look. As a primer, I wait several seconds after I apply it before putting on lipstick, otherwise the lipstick will slide right off! This is a very nice product that conditions and protects your lips, feels good and looks good too.</li>
    <li> This a great lip balm!  It makes my lips feel very smooth and protected from the sun.  This is my new favorite lip moisturizer!  I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Amazing, 100% repurchase</li>
    <li> I love all Elizabeth Arden products. This Lip Protectant lasts for hours even after eating or drinking. I will definitely be buying more of this product !!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it around my eyes also.</li>
    <li> I was a make up artist for years and 8 Hour Cream was the only thing we used on model&#x27;s lips.  I was thrilled to see it now comes in a lipstick style for my personal use.</li>
    <li> Been using for years!!!  Macys is always out of stock so glad I can get it here.</li>
