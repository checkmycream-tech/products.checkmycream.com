### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>He finds this to be the perfect color.</li>
      <li>I use it to maintain my color and it keeps my hair looking great!</li>
      <li>perfect match in color</li>
      <li>Great if you are getting some brassy tones.</li>
      <li>shampoo is awesome - very rich and creamy - almost don&#x27;t need a cream rinse with it - very good at restoring shine and color to hair in between color treatments (i use semi permanent hair color every 2 months or so)</li>
      <li>Just for Men does a good job though.</li>
      <li>This shampoo made my hair look and feel good.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>Best product for what it does that I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>This is more like a hair dye.</li>
      <li>What more could I want?</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I leave it set and then redistribute some more.</li>
      <li>I really love this shampoo, it helps keep my color fresh in between salon visits.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cruelty-free and about as chemical free as it can be, so I will buy it.</li>
      <li>You also need to use a lot to get your hair clean.</li>
      <li>The seller shipped it very fast to me and the product works fantastically!</li>
      <li>I suppose this was ok but it  made more of a mess than it was worth for sprucing up my mocha hair</li>
      <li>At a certain point it isn&#x27;t enough and I need more &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;color.</li>
      <li>I think it helped maintain my color better and the grey hairs were not as noticeable.</li>
      <li>I went from light blonde to brunette and wanted something that would prevent my hair from fading.  </li>
      <li>I might as well have just dyed my hair over and over and it would have done just as much damage.  </li>
      <li>works very well with 2 applications</li>
      <li>I sometimes change or mix colors, just for fun, adding more blonde or red or ash as the mood strikes me.  </li>
      <li>My husband really likes this product.</li>
      <li>gave this three stars anyway because it doesn&#x27;t really say it will work on untreated hair.</li>
      <li>Ive only used it once,so far so love</li>
      <li>The price was great, seller was quick, and it makes my hair soft, crazy shiny, and enhances the color.</li>
      <li>That is something else she recommended--it adds color without bleaching first and looks like my natural hair color, even leaving natural highlights intact.  </li>
      <li>I live in Florida and need to use it every 2-3 days to maintain my color.</li>
      <li>I have dark brown hair, and this turn it a light brown to medium brown.</li>
      <li>I am surprised that he uses it because he&#x27;s the type that doesn&#x27;t like to bother with the anti-aging signs.</li>
      <li>Adds a few more weeks before I have to spend the bigger $$.</li>
      <li>My hair dresser recommended this to tone down the sparkly grey I am starting to get on top.</li>
      <li>I bought this in several colors for my medium to dark brown hair thinking it would be fun to bring out different highlights.</li>
      <li>Tones down the gray and colors reasonably well, but doesn&#x27;t give that all-over one color dye job look.  </li>

<li> Tones down the gray and colors reasonably well, but doesn&#x27;t give that all-over one color dye job look.  </li>
<li> However, it only works minimally - on hair that barely needs color maintenance.</li>
<li> All have worked really well for me, especially the red colors since red is so hard to upkeep.</li>
<li> Gave about 1/2 a bottle to a friend who suffered an extreme lightening job at a salon, and it made her presentable enough to go out in public until it grew out.</li>
<li> Works well, but does seem to dry my hair out a bit.</li>
<li> but I have recently started coloring it a dark brown.</li>
<li> I purchased the shampoo because I recently got ombr&amp;eacute; highlights, and they were looking a little brassy.</li>
<li> Its not really doing what i thought it would do.</li>
<li> Just be careful where you get it it can stain the shower tiles and grout if you aren&#x27;t careful!</li>
<li> It can leave a bit of residue on your hair, so I&#x27;d recommend using this every other shampoo.</li>
<li> Less harsh.</li>
<li> Added some color to my hair but was a little drying.  </li>
<li> I am not sure I can tell if it enhances my color or keeps my color any longer, or if it is because I have been covering my hair with conditioner in the sun that have UVA/UVB in it, but I would still buy this shampoo again.  </li>
<li> This is very drying shampoo and my poor hair is so unhappy, it&#x27;s just been breaking off in the shower while using this shampoo.  </li>
<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> She was wrong however.</li>
<li> A friend commented with all the lighter and darker tones, she assumed I was having a really expensive salon color my hair.  </li>
<li> I figured you cant go wrong with brown.</li>
<li> Not all that crazy about shampoo and conditioner aspect, and sometimes use a leave-in conditioner, too.  </li>
<li> Ugly color.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed and shame on my for not returning them.</li>

    <li> helps maintain my color in between sessions.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my hair look and feel good. I think it helped maintain my color better and the grey hairs were not as noticeable. I&#x27;d probably purchase this again.</li>
    <li> works very well with 2 applications</li>
    <li> This product does do what it says. I leave it set and then redistribute some more. Great if you are getting some brassy tones. Lasts for a day or so.</li>
    <li> I used another color depositing shampoo that was taken off the market, so I used this as a fallback.  Not all that crazy about shampoo and conditioner aspect, and sometimes use a leave-in conditioner, too.  Tones down the gray and colors reasonably well, but doesn&#x27;t give that all-over one color dye job look.  A friend commented with all the lighter and darker tones, she assumed I was having a really expensive salon color my hair.  I sometimes change or mix colors, just for fun, adding more blonde or red or ash as the mood strikes me.  Gave about 1/2 a bottle to a friend who suffered an extreme lightening job at a salon, and it made her presentable enough to go out in public until it grew out.</li>

    <li> I went from light blonde to brunette and wanted something that would prevent my hair from fading.  I might as well have just dyed my hair over and over and it would have done just as much damage.  This is very drying shampoo and my poor hair is so unhappy, it&#x27;s just been breaking off in the shower while using this shampoo.  Now I only wash my hair 2 or 3 times a week with non-sulfate shampoo and LOTS of conditioner.  Will probably go back to Bumble color depositing shampoo.  Less harsh.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. The price was great, seller was quick, and it makes my hair soft, crazy shiny, and enhances the color. What more could I want?</li>
    <li> I bought this in several colors for my medium to dark brown hair thinking it would be fun to bring out different highlights. I bought this based on the recommendation of a YT video review.  I tried each of the colors I bought several times. No color change in my hair at all. Not even in the sunlight. You also need to use a lot to get your hair clean. I was very disappointed and shame on my for not returning them. They YTer did not say she was sponsored but I have a feeling that was the case.</li>
    <li> Does not work as advertised. Sorry.</li>
    <li> This is more like a hair dye. And the color is off. I have dark brown hair, and this turn it a light brown to medium brown. Ugly color.</li>
    <li> Ive only used it once,so far so love</li>
    <li> This shampoo helps me keep my color longer in between salon visits.  Adds a few more weeks before I have to spend the bigger $$.</li>
    <li> Never saw a color difference. But it cleaned like shampoo.</li>
    <li> Added some color to my hair but was a little drying.  Will need to use conditioner with this product.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this product. I am surprised that he uses it because he&#x27;s the type that doesn&#x27;t like to bother with the anti-aging signs. He finds this to be the perfect color.</li>
    <li> I am not sure I can tell if it enhances my color or keeps my color any longer, or if it is because I have been covering my hair with conditioner in the sun that have UVA/UVB in it, but I would still buy this shampoo again.  Just because I cannot tell, maybe it does do something.  It&#x27;s cruelty-free and about as chemical free as it can be, so I will buy it.</li>
    <li> Works well, but does seem to dry my hair out a bit. I live in Florida and need to use it every 2-3 days to maintain my color. However, it only works minimally - on hair that barely needs color maintenance. At a certain point it isn&#x27;t enough and I need more &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;color. Best product for what it does that I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> The seller shipped it very fast to me and the product works fantastically!</li>
    <li> Its not really doing what i thought it would do. It doesn&#x27;t seem to deposit color like i thought it would</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo, it helps keep my color fresh in between salon visits. It can leave a bit of residue on your hair, so I&#x27;d recommend using this every other shampoo. I&#x27;ve used mocha drench, fluid fire, and crimson splash (I change my hair color often). All have worked really well for me, especially the red colors since red is so hard to upkeep.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I use it to maintain my color and it keeps my hair looking great!</li>
    <li> I purchased the shampoo because I recently got ombr&amp;eacute; highlights, and they were looking a little brassy. Shampooing with mocha drench twice a week is almost like having a toner. Just be careful where you get it it can stain the shower tiles and grout if you aren&#x27;t careful!</li>
    <li> perfect match in color</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this to tone down the sparkly grey I am starting to get on top. She was wrong however. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all at adding color if you don&#x27;t already have color treated hair. Just for Men does a good job though. That is something else she recommended--it adds color without bleaching first and looks like my natural hair color, even leaving natural highlights intact.  I just ignore the &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; part and use it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this three stars anyway because it doesn&#x27;t really say it will work on untreated hair.</li>
    <li> I use to use a different color when my hair was reds but I have recently started coloring it a dark brown. The one I used before worked so well but the color didn&#x27;t match my hair. I figured you cant go wrong with brown. I don&#x27;t see any difference at all.</li>
