    <li> Everything as expected. Easy application. Long lasting. Very metallic and attractive on all skin shades (I shared with friends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware however that they will post the tattoos in a ridiculously huge box and, if you live in an apartment you&#x27;ll probably have to trek to your nearest post office to pick it up since it won&#x27;t fit conveniently in to your mail slot.

    <li> stay on a long time, love them</li>
    <li> Very pretty. Wore these on vacation and received so many compliments and stares. They can last up to a week. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These tattoos are awesome!!! I went to EDC with these and even after all the sweat they lasted an entire 9 hours of heat!!! Definitely recommend, and I will be using them again.</li>
    <li> These tattoos are so fun.  I wore them on the beach in Mexico.  Even throughout the sun and saltwater, they stayed on.  Start to rub off or fade (depending on how much you touch them) around the 4th or 5th day, but a few of mine lasted almost a week.  Thoroughly please at all the options I got for such a good price!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, great variety of designs and lasts through a few washes.  Also great value.</li>
    <li> Wearing these to a wedding, believe it or not :)&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous, great price, great quality.</li>

    <li> Good prices, OK designs, but I don&#x27;t think they were that attractive. Furthermore, the quality was very questionable - after a day, the tattoos were splitting in a most unattractive manner. Don&#x27;t think I will be repurchasing. Will spend a bit more money and buy ones of a higher quality.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. My only recommendation is not to put them on areas where you will be washing throughout the day as the tattoo will wash away immediately. Also i noticed that the tattoos won&#x27;t stay on with the lotion I use on my skin. When I choose to put these on I always change the type of body lotion I use. Once I do this they last for days!</li>
    <li> I received good 5 sheets tattoos for my daughter. They have fun for their party. Very shiny and last longer.</li>
    <li> Fun product and stays on for a long time.</li>
