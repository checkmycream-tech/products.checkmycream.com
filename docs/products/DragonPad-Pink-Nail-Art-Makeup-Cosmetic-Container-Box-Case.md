    <li> is the perfect size for holding my bling, buttons and brads. I can either remove a couple dividers to fit smaller compartments. I just ordered two more!</li>
    <li> daughter is going to love it for her clay stuff</li>
    <li> It is too small for me, I should have looked closer at the dimensions :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and none of her nail polish fit in here it soo small!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than you think</li>
    <li> This is not a container for nail polish. It is just a crafting container and we got a clear one, not pink. Very dissappointed.</li>
    <li> Did not receive the pink it was a clear box which we order because of the pink. Every thing else was ok except the colr</li>
    <li> I bought this to put nail polish in, but it&#x27;s so small. I was expecting something bigger for the price I paid. Disappointed...</li>
    <li> Regular sized polish bottles don&#x27;t fit in the compartments, but my daughter says it works great as a travel jewelry caddy.</li>
    <li> this is too small my nail polish won&#x27;t even fit in there.... very small. lessons learned grrrrr....</li>
    <li> I bought this to store my polishes and to my dismay the bottles didn&#x27;t even fit in them. Idk what  I would even put in the tiny compartment. Jewelry?  Since its from china it&#x27;s not worth sending back.  What a waste of money! Stay away!</li>
    <li> As the title says I received blue and paid for pink. I wasn&#x27;t even notified that I was going to get a different color.</li>
    <li> The box broke on one corner during shipping and the box is extremely small for regular size nail polishes.  I ended up giving it to my daughter for her hair accessories and for her miniature nail polishes she has to play pretend with. Good box for sewing or little nick nacks but not for polish like it states. All the compartments are the same size so not a whole lot of options of what fits.</li>
    <li> I had to the plastic dividers out of two, in order o hols my polish but it workers.</li>
    <li> Nice little container for my essie polishes. I needed something to organize my polishes and this did the trick. It&#x27;s nothing special but it&#x27;s sturdy and thats all I can really ask for.</li>
    <li> nice, but I thought it would  be tall enough to hold polish bottles.  my mistake.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking the case would be perfect for the sets of nail polish and nail jewels for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;I received what looks the same as pictured but there is definitely no way I could fit 32 nail polishes in this thing. The would all be lying on their side. I did get to use it for my daughter for her rubber bands for her loom kit, so it worked out but not satisfied with the size it is.</li>
    <li> To Too small to even hold nail polish or a tube of lipstick the only thing I found this good for is to hold beads</li>
    <li> Great, I wish I could of bought two</li>
    <li> the picture makes it look big. this container is not worth buying. go to the 99 cent store surely you will get your buck worth . this is not worth it! not even a  nail polish its in or lip sticks.</li>
    <li> This item came in clear not PINK as I ordered it, its very very very small maybe can use for the rubberband bacelets, DEFINATELY NOT FOR NAIL POLISH NAIL ART MAKE-P  WAY TOOOOO SMALL.  Not satisfied at all.  don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very small , they Dont carry the extra drawers or no more for that fact , it very little to put diamonds,strip ,glue little things an u can take the dividers out to make more room</li>
    <li> Skittle bite smaller than I thought but I like it</li>
    <li> Box came smashed never again</li>
    <li> We loved this container. Bought it for make-up but ended up using it for jewelry. Would recommend it for many things. The compartments are easily removed.</li>
    <li> I guess i should have paid more attention, the box is so small you can&#x27;t hold makeup in it. Nail art I guess, decals only</li>
    <li> I was expecting something larger for nail polishes. Either I did not read size properly or it was not easy to read.</li>
    <li> I bought it because it&#x27;s advertised as a &amp;#34;nail art&amp;#34; case, but the compartments inside are tiny and cannot hold a bottle of polish. I&#x27;m not sure what they could hold besides tiny jewel or beads. It definitely wouldn&#x27;t fit any makeup containers either.</li>
    <li> This container was smaller than i expected. It has 3 detachable rows and on each row there are these very small sections not big enough to hold much.  To be honest i don&#x27;t think this should be called a makeup case but I use it for my various size false nails.</li>
    <li> RECEIVED ITEM LOVE IT. LOVE THE SIZE MAYBE WILL ORDER MORE...JOAN</li>
    <li> Ordered pink got clear not worth 30 dollars to return.  Christmas is busy but .....</li>
    <li> i thought it was bigger for some reason i didnt read the specs...and the nail polishes almost dont fit within the dividers. Is cool to carry around and is stackable.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect a clear colored container. This product is not pink. If you are looking for a pink container to be delivered, don&#x27;t order this. Took forever for it to come. I forgot about even ordering it when it came.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT ITS AWESOME!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too short to hold nail polish and I bought two. I wish I would have read the reviews before buying.</li>
    <li> It was neat cute durable and strong and also handy I like it great storage but not as big as I though it would be.</li>
    <li> Very handy! Not as large as I was expecting, but it&#x27;s a box that organizes the heck out of my stuff. There are even little dividers that you can use or remove at your pleasure.</li>
    <li> Its amazing i mean all of my supplies for my nails fit in the box and you can like make some bigger room on one side or smaller so preatty much anything fits in the box</li>
    <li> That box was so tiny. It keeps falling apart. I really hate it. I cant believe they advertise this as a make up or nail polish box. I really wished i read the reviews on it before i had spend almost $8 on the garbadg. The only thing my daughter could use it for was to put rubbers from her loom kit.  Terrible adversitment. It took a month to come. PLEASE READ REVIEWS IF THERE&#x27;S ANY. I REGRET THIS PURCHASED.</li>
    <li> Came and was white, I ordered pink. Took 4 weeks to arrive. Will hardly hold any nail polish. Was very dissatisfied with this.</li>
    <li> Mine was delivered today and Its not even the pink color that is shown on here, Its clear. I honestly don&#x27;t even know what the hell to put in it cause its so small! i Could have spent my 7.99 on something else Smdh 😠</li>
    <li> Iam not she if she liked this one yet , I just got it</li>
    <li> this product is much smaller than what is shown in pictures.  nail polish bottles can not even fit in the compartments.  Just about all this is good for is to hold cotton balls.  I tried to return it, but it is not possible.  very cheaply built as well.  I really hate this product.</li>
    <li> Love the color Can be used for more than nail items</li>
    <li> Was much smaller than I expected. The seller should include the size of the item.&lt;br /&gt;Good for little kids,</li>
    <li> love the pink -  giving to  my grand daughters</li>
    <li> Upon arrival of this I was very surprised to see that it was shoved in my mail box . I didn&#x27;t know what it was because I expected it to be much lager. From the pic it appears big, and resembles a lot of compartments however it just has three stackable draws. I read previous post that said the same but ignored them because it still looked useful. I was fooled and for the price it&#x27;s not worth it to send it back</li>
    <li> Cute case but nail polish bottles do not fit so definitely not for polish</li>
    <li> It is really nice. Lots of room for beginners. I love how it can make more space. I think its great.</li>
    <li> It was very small. Expected it to be a little bit bigger. Cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Very useful box for my acrylics. It is light weight and i love the color. I recommemed it for anyone.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t quite like it. The box is made of cheap material/ It was also delivered weeks after it was due.</li>
