      <li>Other than that, this product is the best.</li>

      <li>The smell is wonderful and it does appear to be making less frizzy.  </li>

      <li>The next day, shampoo and condition as usual and watch your hair transform into beautiful healthy hair!!!  </li>
      <li>When it arrived I smelled it and it smells good enough to eat.</li>
      <li>Not bad,</li>
      <li>African American love it, great for hair crack</li>
      <li>This stuff makes your hair so soft  love it, I use it every night on my hair before I go to bed, I am a natural woman and it gives my hair a nice shine, so</li>
      <li>but if I would give this a distinct smell, it is like softee hair grease.</li>
      <li>I finally feel like I bought a nice hair oil product.</li>
      <li>From being absolutely gorgeous my hair went downhill in less than 7 years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, I just fund that using plain coconut oil instead works better for me.</li>
      <li>My hair is stronger and much healthier!</li>

      <li>This was evident by the compliments I received</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing as well!</li>
      <li>As long as I used it, my hair began to return to its healthy state and had thickened up.</li>
      <li>I had the most over processed, dry, damaged and frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s just an open bottle of oil that easily spills</li>
      <li>but I do love that its paraben free a must for me lately</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>The reason being primarily hair color and using straightening irons on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>and it makes it very shiny.</li>
      <li>after using this oil about 4 times, I can brush my whole head and</li>
      <li>I would get in the shower the night before and mildly shampoo my hair, dry the hair, massage the Cactus oil  (used as hot oil) from the scalp to the ends, then follow with the Vatika Coconut oil after warming it.</li>
      <li>Main ingredient is mineral oil which clogs pores, and the consistency is rather greasy- doesn&#x27;t absorb into hair or skin</li>
      <li>I will purchase this product again and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love Indian hair products. They work well for my ethnic hair. I am African American with hair that frizzes and kinks, but is closer to Hispanic hair than super nappy, but I perm my hair as well. I bought this product because it has garlic in it. I really like it. It makes my hair feel moisturized and it makes it very shiny. It helps tame my curly locks as well. Good product.</li>
    <li> Omg! I had the most over processed, dry, damaged and frizzy hair. From being absolutely gorgeous my hair went downhill in less than 7 years. The reason being primarily hair color and using straightening irons on a daily basis. I was so depressed. Anyways I went to an Indian store to buy coconut oil for my hair and came back with this one. I&#x27;ve only applied it to my hair 4 times in the last couple of weeks and I am delighted that my hair has recovered to 80% of what it originally was. This is a miracle hair oil/treatment. People at my work have been commenting on my hair non stop! Love love love this hair oil. Nothing short of a miracle!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It is a great product to help hair breakage. It smells good to some and now it does to me but if I would give this a distinct smell, it is like softee hair grease. If anyone has used that before, then the smell is distinctive. Not bad, but I had to get used to that type of smell from my childhood again. Other than that, this product is the best.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter too work down on breakage and it did work. I find this is very good quality oil.</li>
    <li> I use this with my conditioner.  Love it  I either use Aubrey or Herbal Essences condish</li>
    <li> Great shippment, Love it.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Reduced shedding and adds moisture. I apply it to my roots before bed and I have had no more shed hair. Great!</li>
    <li> Like all vatika products that I have tried so far. Coconut oil, almond oil as well as this cactus oil... the scent is odd. People say this is super bad for your hair because of the mineral oil in it but I have noticed nothing but good things.</li>
    <li> I use this as a treatment before shampooing my hair. I apply it to my scalp and hair generously then massage for several minutes. This oil smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t appreciate this oil at first until I realized that my hair started shedding and breaking AGAIN after I didn&#x27;t reorder.  Over 1 year ago my hair was damaged with breakage and dealing with stress caused it to fall out horribly. So I began a google search for hair growth and strengthening and found this Vatika Cactus Hair Oil. As long as I used it, my hair began to return to its healthy state and had thickened up. This was evident by the compliments I received and I noticed less hair in the comb when I washed it. I also used the Vatika coconut oil in combination with this as a pre-poo conditioner. I would get in the shower the night before and mildly shampoo my hair, dry the hair, massage the Cactus oil  (used as hot oil) from the scalp to the ends, then follow with the Vatika Coconut oil after warming it. Place a plastic conditioning cap then secure it with a fitting cap or wrap while you sleep. The next day, shampoo and condition as usual and watch your hair transform into beautiful healthy hair!!!  BTW I am an african american woman (51yo) with relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> This product contains a harmful cancerous ingredient in it, called BHT, which is detrimental to your health. Trashed as harmful and not recommended at all!</li>
    <li> Awesome, delivery on point, Thanks.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband whose hair is thinning on the top.I hope it works for him,it is too soon to tell.The oil itself has a good feel,but my objection to it is that is is heavily perfumed.some people may not be bothered by it,my husband didn&#x27;t care or notice.</li>
    <li> I love how this oil smells I haven&#x27;t used it enough to see results but I do love that its paraben free a must for me lately</li>
    <li> Dabur Batika Cactus Hair Oil is like a fountain of youth to dry and very dry hair. Going through the change of life and hair need a pick me up.  Used it immediately and saw good results. Keeps the hair soft and manageable, it also manages the gray hair and keeps it from being to wiry. I will purchase this product again and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can across this on amazon while looking for coconut oil by the same company. I stopped and googled the use of cactus oil and found out it is good for reducing hair shedding. So I thought what the heck I&#x27;ll add this to some of my diy products I make for my 4a-b natural african american hair. When it arrived I smelled it and it smells good enough to eat. It kind of has the smell of a pulpy succulent like agave or jicama.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this oil but it made my hair very dry and brittle. I purchase the the coconut oil by Dabur and that has work wonders.</li>
    <li> My hair isn&#x27;t falling out or thinning but my grandmothers did and so has my mother, so I am trying to get ahead of the game by starting now building up my quantity.  Hope it works!  The smell is wonderful and it does appear to be making less frizzy.  Here&#x27;s hoping.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil.  I mix it with some of my hair growth oils.  Also use for hot oil treatment.</li>
    <li> Awful stuff. Filled with junk that isn&#x27;t good for your hair like mineral oil. Not a natural product,weighs down your hair and dries it out.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Very light</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use it as a prepoo and as a scalp oil on wet hair. Smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it as a deep conditioning treatment on damp hair too! I absolutely love this oil. Sad the sellers have jacked up the price though, this retails at $4 in the Indian shops but what happens when Internet  sellers know a product is in demand? The price sky rockets smh. I won&#x27;t purchase again from here not at $15 when it&#x27;s only $4 retail.</li>
    <li> This is great for hair fallout but definitely has a smell to it. It has garlic in it which is also great for hair fall out but I can smell it in the oil. I use this at night and wash my hair the next morning to get the smell out. If u dont mind the smell then id recommend this. Very moisturizing as well! Definitely helped!</li>
    <li> Love these it smells great and leaves my hair so soft I have used it twice so far since I just received it so haven&#x27;t notice any change in my hair meaning loosing amounts of hair but fingers crossed!!!</li>
    <li> IT SMELLS SO GOOD, VERY HEALTHY AS WELL, I LOVE IT THANKFUL FOR SEEING THIS AND FINDING IT :) .</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your hair so soft  love it, I use it every night on my hair before I go to bed, I am a natural woman and it gives my hair a nice shine, so if you have dull hair give this a try and I know you will love it, It is also good for relaxed hair also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and other products by Vatika for about a year. It has improved the softness of my hair,therefore less stress on my hair. The smell is pleasant and not overpowering. Great for conditioning and prepoo on my natural hair. I intend to keep this as a staple in my hair products</li>
    <li> This cactus oil smells amazing. My mom and I are currently using this to help with the shedding in our hair.  We have noticed a difference with this product after only using it a few times. Highly recommended. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, I just fund that using plain coconut oil instead works better for me. I was using to decrease hair fall, increase thickness, shine and make my hair grow out faster</li>
    <li> Am using the products and it takes a while for one to post results so I will let yall know how it goes</li>
    <li> Bought this as a pre-shampoo treatment after reading reviews here saying that this product reduced hair shedding and smelled nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several issues with this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. There is no mechanism to control the amount of oil that comes out- You unscrew the lid and there&#x27;s just an open bottle of oil that easily spills&lt;br /&gt;2. Smells like an old lady&#x27;s stockings!!  Too heavily perfumed to cover the still noticeable garlic scent&lt;br /&gt;3. Main ingredient is mineral oil which clogs pores, and the consistency is rather greasy- doesn&#x27;t absorb into hair or skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my hair from getting too dry after a shampoo, but I can only tolerate this for about 30 min because of the smell and greasiness</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I usually put in in my hair before bed, then wash it in the morning. My (over processed) hair looks like untouched virgin hair once its done. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time. I am on a hair journey and my hair is very very dry. If you have dry hair this is the product. You can use it as a pre-poo, or leave in. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product will buy again. Great seller fast delivery. Thank you</li>
    <li> Natural hair African American love it, great for hair crack</li>
    <li> As soon as I got the product, I opened it and its smell was so nice. I finally feel like I bought a nice hair oil product. I didn&#x27;t use it yet so I don&#x27;t know how well it works, but I am sure it&#x27;s going to be AWESOME!</li>
    <li> My hair was braking badly. Now my hair is becoming stronger with much less breakage and has sheen that it didn&#x27;t have before.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product because it seems not natural, maybe because it has been perfumed artificially.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this oil. Also would repurchase. Love this oil worked well on my naturally curly thick hair.</li>
    <li> smellsssssssssssssssssssss great! nothing like cactus at all!! :))&lt;br /&gt;I leave this in my hair over night ( you don&#x27;t have too) but I do and wash out with WARM WATER ( to get rid of the oils)and leave my hair sooooo soft and smells like baby shampoo!! and THE BEST PART IS , HAIR LOSS! LESS HAIR IS FALLING FOR ME! I USE THIS TWICE A WEEK with other VATIKA HAIR OILS to re growth my hair!</li>
    <li> I love most everything vatika does and the cactus oil is no exception. Its smooth not too heavy and it smells great</li>
    <li> A couple of friends and I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Very little goes a long way. We love the little to no smell</li>
    <li> Excellent for hair.  Delivery on time</li>
    <li> I love the clean scent that it has...wasn&#x27;t excepting that at all for it to be Cactus Oil. It also helps pervent the hair from shedding.</li>
    <li> This hair oil is amazing! Before my hair was always shedding and breaking off alot.....after using this oil about 4 times, I can brush my whole head and only one or two long strands fall...I love it so much, the smell is light and nice too! My hair is stronger and much healthier! Love it! Please keep this in stock, I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
