      <li>So, after reading all the favorable reviews on Wildroot Hair Groom Original</li>
      <li>Very glad to see Amazon had it, and very pleased with the soft styling that just a tiny amount will achieve.  </li>
      <li>fast shipment, love the product</li>
      <li>I was looking for a product I could blow dry into my hair, and while this allows that, it&#x27;s probably best served just applied to the hair directly after drying or while damp and allowed to air-dry.</li>
      <li>I just love this product and Amazon was the only place I could find it, knowing this web site is safe.</li>
      <li>Tames bed-head pretty well, smells soapy and clean, and soaks into the hair eventually for hold and control.</li>
      <li>My 87 year old father has used this product most of his life.  </li>
      <li>The smell is nice and he uses it regularly.</li>
      <li>Like body lotion, it disappears as it is absorbed.</li>
      <li>It leaves the hair with just the right amount of shine and hold.</li>
      <li>great, I was not able to find it in the stores..</li>
      <li>The smell goes away quickly and disappears altogether very soon.</li>
      <li>I read all of the reviews, and was surprised that in addition to it being a great hair grooming product, no one mentioned that it is great for soothing a bad sunburn (must be the lanolin).</li>
      <li>I comb it out first, then I brush</li>
      <li>Gives nice wet shine but has no hold.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and can no longer find it locally.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that works for him :)</li>
      <li>I first started using this product when I was 14.</li>
      <li>The cream makes my hair feel soft with a healthy and natural glowing look.  </li>
      <li>This hair product works very well with mix children hair.</li>
      <li>my hair feel normal with the first application , also I dont see change in my hair style .</li>
      <li>and advertised for the whole family.  </li>
      <li>He missed it so much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Wildroot works really well.</li>
      <li>The title really says it all.</li>
      <li>It is a good grooming product for heavy hair that needs moisturizing and light taming, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair unfashionably plastered down.  </li>
      <li>Wildroot is a classic.</li>
      <li>No hard hair gel.  </li>
      <li>The ne new products just don&#x27;t measure up.</li>
      <li>This product I had used for years, it is exactly the same which makes managing your hair a lot easier.</li>
      <li>Works well on my 1 year old son</li>
      <li>Hair stays soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>Have used this product nearly all my adult life.  </li>
      <li>The smell reminds me of the old barbershops.</li>
      <li>Here is a radio jingle I remember from the old days:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Ya</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair, but the hair he has needs to have Wild Root Oil.</li>
      <li>He loves it and was surprised when he opened the box and found that I had purchased it for him.</li>
      <li>but so far it has not been done.</li>
      <li>natural looking no greasy looking hair.</li>
      <li>My grandfather used it, my father used it, and recently I&#x27;ve realized that I should be using it.&lt;br /&gt;I swapped over from using a pomade and my hair after a couple weeks feels so much</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My mother used Wildroot Cream Oil on my hair when I was a child.  I remember it as being oilier then, but having slick hair is very unfashionable now.  This product is a heavy lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave the hair too greasy. It is a good grooming product for heavy hair that needs moisturizing and light taming, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair unfashionably plastered down.  Like body lotion, it disappears as it is absorbed.</li>
    <li> I stumbled on Wildroot while looking for a Brylcreem alternative. I&#x27;d been an avid Brylcreem user for a few years now, but lately I got the feeling that the formula had changed. It didn&#x27;t seem to hold as well, and seemed to dry on the hair. So the search was on for another vintage hair groom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wildroot works really well. It has a very subtle scent to it. If you&#x27;ve ever used Brylcreem, it&#x27;s along those lines but not as strong. The smell goes away quickly and disappears altogether very soon. I use an amount about the size of a quarter and rub it through my hair after washing when it&#x27;s still damp. It leaves the hair with just the right amount of shine and hold. By hold, I mean staying where you brush or comb it; it&#x27;s never a stiff hold. You can comb and brush through the day and it still looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It washes out easily and doesn&#x27;t build up. You will want to remember to shake the bottle well before each application, since the water and oil tends to separate. I&#x27;m glad I found this!</li>
    <li> Great product, used it from childhood on.</li>
    <li> i am a woman with very coarce hair like most Mohawk indians have! this product I have used all my life to keep it where I want it to go and make it appear softer than what it is! There is no othere produt on the market since &amp;#34;Charles Antel Formula 49&amp;#34;! Nothing else works on my hair!!!</li>
    <li> Bought it for a senior citizen friend of mine who cannot find it in any store, anymore.  He&#x27;s been using it all of his life.  He loves this stuff.  He had no problem with the cost for me to get it through Amazon.  He&#x27;s a happy camper.  In fact, he had me order him a second bottle, just in case it becomes totally unavailable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wildroot Hair Groom on my hair for 61 years.  The cream makes my hair feel soft with a healthy and natural glowing look.  It always has and still does. I would never use any other product on my hair because Wildroot Hair Groom works for me.  It&#x27;s the best!  The Stephan Co. is tops!</li>
    <li> Have used this product nearly all my adult life.  Good &amp; consistent product.  Ordered two because it is difficult to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Love Wildroot Cream oil! It&#x27;s just as good today as it was when my mom used it on my hair fifty years ago. Glad I remembered it and re-tried it. I&#x27;m African American and do twists. Gives a great soft curly look when I take them out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband. He&#x27;s used it for years and it&#x27;s so very hard to find in the stores any more. He loves it and was surprised when he opened the box and found that I had purchased it for him.</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised. I have been using it for 50 years or more. The package came on time. I just love this product and Amazon was the only place I could find it, knowing this web site is safe.</li>
    <li> my hair feel normal with the first application , also I dont see change in my hair style . absolutetly bad</li>
    <li> my husband has been using this for most of his life and LOVES it.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product.  I&#x27;ve used Wildroot for 20 years.  Happy to see Amazon is carrying it.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This hair oil hasn&#x27;t changed in the 50 years+ that I&#x27;ve been using it. I use it when I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;  First I dry my hair with a towel, then I apply it on my hair while its still a little wet. I comb it out first, then I brush it.&lt;br /&gt;  It looks a little wet at first ... by the time I get to work, my curly hair will be dry, and my hair looks great!&lt;br /&gt;  It keeps my ends from splitting and helps my hair to grow faster.&lt;br /&gt;  Definitely a product that can save you money on wigs, weaves, and extensions by inhancing your &amp;#34;NATURAL HAIR&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This product adds a lot of moisture and body while controlling fly- aways. Nothing like the old stuff to keep your hair looking its best!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Tames bed-head pretty well, smells soapy and clean, and soaks into the hair eventually for hold and control. I was looking for a product I could blow dry into my hair, and while this allows that, it&#x27;s probably best served just applied to the hair directly after drying or while damp and allowed to air-dry. Still, I&#x27;d order it again when needed.</li>
    <li> I had been looking every where for this product with no luck. I decided to check out Amazon and it was there. This product I had used for years, it is exactly the same which makes managing your hair a lot easier. Smells good and helps your hair to look good.</li>
    <li> It is the type of hair groom I like and at the price I like. Shipping time was faster than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wildroot Cream Oil Charley&lt;br /&gt;It keeps your hair in shape</li>
    <li> Great buy.  Only a couple drops needed.  Just like i remember as a kid.  Ill order more in the future</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad. He&#x27;s been using it for years and hasn&#x27;t been able to find it in stores. He is very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> The product was in jell form rather than liquid, probably due to age, and was unusable. I am in the process of getting it replaced by Corner Drugstore but so far it has not been done. I am hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 50 some years and it is a really good light hair dressing,  gives a little shine  but is not like a gel. I see from other reviewers that this product is hard to find.  Major retailers do not carry it anymore,  I guess men don&#x27;t use anything on their hair anymore.  Anyway Amazon was the only place I could find it, and I am araid one of these days the Stephans Co. will quit making it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, and have been using it for some 47 years... but NOT on my hair, but my face because of the lanolin in it!</li>
    <li> really love this stuff</li>
    <li> I sent it to my Dad in Michigan because he couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Even Walgreen stores that on-line said they had. He missed it so much. He would sing me the commercial jingle for the product from decades ago!! What a hoot. He doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair, but the hair he has needs to have Wild Root Oil. It&#x27;s the only thing that works for him :)</li>
    <li> I could not find it in Walgreen&#x27;s where I have bought it for 50 years. I decided to try this approach and how satisfied I am! I hope the product is not being discontinued.</li>
    <li> After using it for 30 years I still find it to be the best hair dressing on the  market !!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as I remember it back in the day. The old product was creamier and smelled different. The bottle was shaped different too.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. Other hair tonics have caused dandruff.</li>
    <li> Wildroot is a classic. My grandfather used it, my father used it, and recently I&#x27;ve realized that I should be using it.&lt;br /&gt;I swapped over from using a pomade and my hair after a couple weeks feels so much better.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp isn&#x27;t as painful or irritated and my hair looks &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but the product still holds it in place.</li>
    <li> I heard about Wildroot Cream Oil on a vintage radio program.  It was popular in the 50s (I&#x27;ll bet my dad used it!) and advertised for the whole family.  Something about the barbershop quartet singing, \\&quot;Try Wildroot Cream Oil ---  CHAR-lie!\\&quot; over and over again apparently got into my brain, because when I cut my hair very short recently I was really curious to try it.  Very glad to see Amazon had it, and very pleased with the soft styling that just a tiny amount will achieve.  No more stiff mousse or gel for me.  The bottle arrived quickly and will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over a year, now, and like how it holds your hair without being stiff or greasy.  The smell reminds me of the old barbershops.</li>
    <li> I first started using this product when I was 14. Never used any other hair product. I have a whole lot less hair now than then. It was 1946 when I started using Wildroot.</li>
    <li> Gives nice wet shine but has no hold. Brylcreem is a better product but still a good product.</li>
    <li> My 87 year old father has used this product most of his life.  When we could no longer find it locally, I turned to the internet.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works well on my 1 year old son</li>
    <li> The title really says it all. Having used Wildroot for roughly sixty years I now have trouble finding it. The ne new products just don&#x27;t measure up. It&#x27;s precisely what I ordered, delivered promptly, and in good condition.</li>
    <li> No hard hair gel.  Hair stays soft and manageable. Nice fragrance. What&#x27;s not to like. Glad I tried it again after many years.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for years. He will not use anything else, he tried different products but found none to his liking. Therefore, it must bea great product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and can no longer find it locally.  I appreciate being able to buy it on line from Amazon.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> My husband really liked this gift! I gave it to him on valentines day and it brought back such memories. The smell is nice and he uses it regularly. Wildroot he used in his teens and twenties. It really is a darn good product.</li>
    <li> I decided to let my hair grow and needed something to tame it a bit. My wife gave me her Caviar CC Cream, which does a nice job, but it is quite expensive for a 2.5 ounce tube. So, after reading all the favorable reviews on Wildroot Hair Groom Original I decided to give it a try. Regardless of how little I use, it leaves my hair feeling and looking dirty. I&#x27;m currently experimenting with Redken for Men Get Groomed Finishing Cream. While I have to use a good size dab of of the Get Groomed, it does okay. Much better than the Wildroot.</li>
    <li> i would recommend this product to everyone. it has been on the market for years. i wish the stores would start selling it again.</li>
    <li> Wildroot hair creme has been around for a long time.  No greasy feel, no smelly hair, hair looks natural and stays in place without being stiff or gooey.  It works, it&#x27;s that simple.  I hope they never go away or at least that I die before they do.</li>
    <li> it works but i have not reordered. i am not sure why, maybe i like the old fashion wax better and the wax is not as expensive as this.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wildroot for 60 years or more.  I read all of the reviews, and was surprised that in addition to it being a great hair grooming product, no one mentioned that it is great for soothing a bad sunburn (must be the lanolin).</li>
    <li> This product was old and the odor was unbelievable.  Bought for a friend for use in his barbershop.  Never again!</li>
    <li> Works as well as the original Wildroot hair lotion that  my husband used years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores ioday. Keeps his  hair in place.</li>
    <li> I love this product used it as a child and now I&#x27;m using it on my hair and my grand daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> fast shipment, love the product</li>
    <li> The promptness in receiving this product was amazing.  I have not  tried  this product as yet, but seen no reason it shouldn&#x27;t be as good as the item I receive in the store.......Thank you</li>
    <li> Little known old time product,great hold natural looking no greasy looking hair.As good as ever</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find this cream oil locally but was unsuccessful. It&#x27;s what my mom used on my hair when I was a kid. I&#x27;m now 65 plus and it is perfect for my type of hair. So nice to be able to find it and at a great price as well. Plan to stock up on it just in case it is discontinued here.</li>
    <li> great, I was not able to find it in the stores..</li>
    <li> This hair product works very well with mix children hair. Tames the wildest hair and control without heavy oil in their hair</li>
    <li> This was not the first time I have used this product, so I already knew of its Great Attributes. It is an AWESOME hair product. No matter what type of hair you have, it will give it luster and you don&#x27;t need a lot. I&#x27;ve used it for years and when it became scarce in stores, I had to find it elsewhere. If you have curly/wavy hair, it&#x27;s PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCWMSK/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_img</li>
    <li> This is the only hair product I have used for over 40 years. The product works extremely well for me.</li>
    <li> I like this product, and wonder why it is no longer available in drug stores. It is excellent for grooming my hair, making it lay just right. Only slight downside is that the aroma is a wee bit stronger than I think it should be. Here is a radio jingle I remember from the old days:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Ya better get Wildroot Cream oil Charlie---It keeps your hair in trim------- It&#x27;s made with soothing lanolin.  Get Wildlroot Cream oil Charlie--- start using it today---You&#x27;ll find that you will have a tough time Charlie, keeping all the girls away.&amp;#34;</li>
