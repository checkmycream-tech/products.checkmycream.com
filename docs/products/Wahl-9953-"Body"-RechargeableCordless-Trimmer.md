      <li>If I would of known how good this thing was, I would of bought it sooner.</li>
      <li>This is a good trimmer for the money.</li>
      <li>I had heard of the Wahl name before and assumed that it was a good product.</li>
      <li>it holds the charge and is very agile, it weights more than I thought it would</li>
      <li>For now I&#x27;m going to stick to the far from perfect Philips Remington body groomer.  </li>
      <li>Very good, high quality unit.</li>
      <li>but it sure does it job.</li>
      <li>This beard and body trimmer is just more \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; junk.</li>
      <li>when i bought this shaver i thought it was their newest and most improved.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>we&#x27;ll keep on trying :)</li>
      <li>He wasnt exactly super thrilled</li>
      <li>The blades rust really easily.</li>
      <li>Luckily I found this and am quite satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>The product got here in no time, and it was free shipping.</li>
      <li>Easy to handle easy to use, always used Wahl products, quick interchangeable heads, convenient charger stand, meets my expectations</li>
      <li>I like the clean look.</li>
      <li>That means it would have taken many more passes over my head to finish the job, if it weren&#x27;t for all the problems above.    </li>
      <li>Very nice, very sharp.</li>
      <li>Powerful and versitile.</li>
      <li>but that means it&#x27;s powerful.</li>
      <li>It is powerful, light, sturdy and comes with a whole bunch of useful attachments.</li>
      <li>Holds a nice long charge.</li>
      <li>I did note that the beard shaver attachment wasn&#x27;t particularly efficient and left too many bruises, but other than that it was a great buy.</li>
      <li>I ended up buying some higher end</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a decent shaver for a long time, and most of them were over $50.</li>
      <li>But it trims and shaves very well.</li>
      <li>I really wish I had gotten another Norelco.  </li>
      <li>This trimmer works as advertised and is very affordable.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased Wahl hair clippers and other items for many years.  </li>
      <li>it is pretty much the same as all other hair clippers i own and doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
      <li>this trimmer require a little bit more of blade, in general it&#x27;s a good products, but a little for work in large areas.</li>
      <li>That product could use some improvement because the shaving cartridge tends to get loose and fall out, but it handles delicate areas much more effectively.</li>
      <li>In the normal straight position it is the slowest, but turned 90 to 120 degrees from there</li>
      <li>Feels great in the hand, but impossible to clean off the hair.  </li>
      <li>Probably ok for minimal clean up, but not really a &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; trimmer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does have a somewhat small trimmer \\&quot;head\\&quot; and by virtue of being rechargeable it is necessary for the user to make more than one pass over the scalp, but if you want to cut your hair as close as a blade, this unit does it just fine....</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I thought it was going to die a few years ago and purchased 3 more.  </li>
      <li>this is a major flaw that many other rechargeable razors have as well, not just Wahl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wahl trimmers that are plug-in based that were highly reviewed and so far so good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has the quality of a professional machine at a non-professional price.</li>
      <li>Got nicked in a sensitive area --</li>
      <li>They both eventually died, completely.</li>
      <li>Really, did they actually test this thing??    </li>
      <li>Miss the old Norelco model that gave up the ghost.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, I would recommend this trimmer to anyone who is looking for one to use all over  the body, including the scalp.</li>
      <li>The original miraculously recovered and the other 2 sit unused in the back of my closet</li>
      <li>MOST IMPORTANTLY, the rechargeable battery will eventually die within a 1 to 2 year timespan rendering the razor useless due to the fact that it cannot be used unless the battery is charged.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small size is perfect for the back of the neck, side burns and any other hard to reach place.</li>
      <li>When you have a product that can do so much that you can&#x27;t find what next to do, as such it is with this item.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Motor noise is certainly a lot less than my older, standard hair trimmer, which makes a terribly loud noise.</li>
      <li>great trimmer, had other ones in the past but this baby works !!!</li>
      <li>I love this trimmer because it yields professional results, is small enough to minimize packing bulk for travel, is long lasting and requires no maintenance for a reasonably long interval.  </li>
      <li>anyways, I&#x27;m giving this product 1 star only due to bad functioning, and also it is kind of small, which I found very interesting when a men&#x27;s body it&#x27;s naturally bigger than a woman&#x27;s.   </li>
      <li>On the other hand,because it is so small and lightweight, it is extremely easy and non-tiring to use.</li>
      <li>I would like to see the head be a little bigger because when you are shaving a large area you want to do it as quickly as possible.</li>

<li> I would like to see the head be a little bigger because when you are shaving a large area you want to do it as quickly as possible.</li>
<li> This machine has replaced my other grooming equipment COMPLETELY.</li>
<li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
<li> I recently received this trimmer because I had hair on certain parts of my body that I wanted removed or at least shaved as closely and effortlessly as possible.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m very surprised that this particular groomer, intended for multi-purpose use, varies between being very ineffective and cutting my skin, but leaving my hair.</li>
<li> Although rather small and using a rechargeable battery, I have been using this trimmer to trim all body hair, including my scalp, which was the main reason i purchased it.</li>
<li> but now the battery doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge to long.</li>
<li> The battery stopped holding a charge no matter how long it would be plugged-in for.</li>
<li> The blade is so slow that it doesn&#x27;t cut my hair very well.    </li>
<li> given that they both had the same problem within such a short period of time, it&#x27;s hard to say that there isn&#x27;t some sort of product flaw.</li>
<li> Its not very functional for the hair removal on the body as it takes quite a bit and repeated attempts to remove hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the same one for at least 5 years.  </li>
<li> this product is no worth buying.</li>
<li> I would typically write this off as a fluke but</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know what that means for someone not going overseas, but it&#x27;s not a good international tool.</li>
<li> plastic attchments / trimmer options seem a little flimsy....</li>
<li> Within a few months my shaver broke--it&#x27;s now in the landfill.  </li>
<li> The battery was very short lived from the start and is all but useless now.</li>
<li> takes 14 hours to charge and loses it&#x27;s charge after 30 minutes of use.</li>
<li> maybe mine was   broken or something</li>
<li> i was wrong.  </li>
<li> The &amp;#34;organizing&amp;#34; set is useless in my opinion.</li>
<li> The company is based in the U.S.A, but have sadly gone to the China method of manufacturing.</li>
<li> Unfortunately the product ran out of battery after 5 min. of use :(</li>
<li> it&#x27;s faster... but impossible to hold and use in that position.    </li>
<li> This thing is absolutely horrible.    </li>
<li> this product is terrible.</li>

    <li> I needed to replace an aging Norelco trimmer.  I really wish I had gotten another Norelco.  This thing is absolutely horrible.    The blade is so slow that it doesn&#x27;t cut my hair very well.    The speed of the blade changes as I turn the head around.  In the normal straight position it is the slowest, but turned 90 to 120 degrees from there it&#x27;s faster... but impossible to hold and use in that position.    The grip is made of rubber.  Feels great in the hand, but impossible to clean off the hair.  Really, did they actually test this thing??    Lastly, the width of the blade is narrower than the Norelco I have.  That means it would have taken many more passes over my head to finish the job, if it weren&#x27;t for all the problems above.    I&#x27;m returning this thing after having it one day.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer for the money. I didn&#x27;t think I would use the attachments but I do all the time. Holds a nice long charge. I use it as my daily shaver for my face. It&#x27;s small size is perfect for the back of the neck, side burns and any other hard to reach place.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Wahl 9953 Body Trimmer to replace a product that gave up the ghost. I wish I had discovered this product sooner. Powerful and versitile. With the added accessories all you need is hair. Very nice, very sharp. Trims like the professionals.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a decent shaver for a long time, and most of them were over $50. Luckily I found this and am quite satisfied with it. It is powerful, light, sturdy and comes with a whole bunch of useful attachments. Definitely recommend this! I did note that the beard shaver attachment wasn&#x27;t particularly efficient and left too many bruises, but other than that it was a great buy.</li>
    <li> Great Product.&lt;br /&gt;Very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic attchments / trimmer options seem a little flimsy....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a Great product.</li>
    <li> I had heard of the Wahl name before and assumed that it was a good product. Well as they said in the movie \\&quot;assumption is the mother of all evils\\&quot;. This beard and body trimmer is just more \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; junk. The company is based in the U.S.A, but have sadly gone to the China method of manufacturing. Never ever will I buy another Wahl product. The battery was very short lived from the start and is all but useless now. Have had the product for approx. one month.</li>
    <li> The product got here in no time, and it was free shipping. However, this was one of my Christmas presents for my hubby, therefore I had to wait until then to get some feedback from him.  Unfortunately the product ran out of battery after 5 min. of use :( we did charge it for over 24 hrs. as indicated on the instructions of the  product.   And even after that, it still stopped working after 5 min of body trimming... anyways, I&#x27;m giving this product 1 star only due to bad functioning, and also it is kind of small, which I found very interesting when a men&#x27;s body it&#x27;s naturally bigger than a woman&#x27;s.   We did not get to try anything else from the product after that, so I can&#x27;t comment on the others heads for the trimmer.   Thank you Wahl... we&#x27;ll keep on trying :)</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;ve been using the same one for at least 5 years.  I thought it was going to die a few years ago and purchased 3 more.  The original miraculously recovered and the other 2 sit unused in the back of my closet (I eventually gave one away).</li>
    <li> great trimmer, had other ones in the past but this baby works !!! it holds the charge and is very agile, it weights more than I thought it would but that means it&#x27;s powerful.</li>
    <li> Excellent Trimmer for the price.  The best thing is you can use it cordless, or you can plug it into the wall.  You never have to wait for it to charge.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer for the price on the market. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great Deal - Recommend</li>
    <li> This product has plastic parts where blades are interchangeable.  The plastic parts do not hold up.  Within a few months my shaver broke--it&#x27;s now in the landfill.  Look around, don&#x27;t buy this product--cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Product works like a charm... Won&#x27;t need anything else from now on. If I would of known how good this thing was, I would of bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> We used it abroad on a trip, and now it won&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t know what that means for someone not going overseas, but it&#x27;s not a good international tool.</li>
    <li> when i bought this shaver i thought it was their newest and most improved.  i was wrong.  it is pretty much the same as all other hair clippers i own and doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I recently received this trimmer because I had hair on certain parts of my body that I wanted removed or at least shaved as closely and effortlessly as possible.  This trimmer works as advertised and is very affordable.  If I could change one thing about this trimmer it would be the head size.  I would like to see the head be a little bigger because when you are shaving a large area you want to do it as quickly as possible.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Wahl hair clippers and other items for many years.  I&#x27;m very surprised that this particular groomer, intended for multi-purpose use, varies between being very ineffective and cutting my skin, but leaving my hair. For now I&#x27;m going to stick to the far from perfect Philips Remington body groomer.  That product could use some improvement because the shaving cartridge tends to get loose and fall out, but it handles delicate areas much more effectively.</li>
    <li> this product is terrible. takes 14 hours to charge and loses it&#x27;s charge after 30 minutes of use. this product is no worth buying. keep away.</li>
    <li> Although rather small and using a rechargeable battery, I have been using this trimmer to trim all body hair, including my scalp, which was the main reason i purchased it. &lt;br /&gt;It does have a somewhat small trimmer \\&quot;head\\&quot; and by virtue of being rechargeable it is necessary for the user to make more than one pass over the scalp, but if you want to cut your hair as close as a blade, this unit does it just fine....On the other hand,because it is so small and lightweight, it is extremely easy and non-tiring to use. &lt;br /&gt;Motor noise is certainly a lot less than my older, standard hair trimmer, which makes a terribly loud noise. &lt;br /&gt;So far, I would recommend this trimmer to anyone who is looking for one to use all over  the body, including the scalp.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is probably the best one I have ever used. It trims close to the skin, so be careful around sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer because it yields professional results, is small enough to minimize packing bulk for travel, is long lasting and requires no maintenance for a reasonably long interval.  It has the quality of a professional machine at a non-professional price.</li>
    <li> this trimmer require a little bit more of blade, in general it&#x27;s a good products, but a little for work in large areas.</li>
    <li> Very good, high quality unit. Like the precision hair trimmer best. Electric shaver head works, but doesn&#x27;t do a perfect job. Overall, yup, I&#x27;d buy it again. I like the clean look.</li>
    <li> Used this once, and then it wouldn&#x27;t work, either plugged in or after recharging.  Haven&#x27;t sought a replacement yet, and I&#x27;ll give an update if I get some satisfaction.  The hair-length attachment is cumbersome to adjust.  Miss the old Norelco model that gave up the ghost.  Still, this feels sturdy...</li>
    <li> I recently bought this trimmer and it never charged   enough for you tu cut any body part maybe mine was   broken or something but i allready had to throw away mine!    ps. It dosent deserve not even one star</li>
    <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long enough. But it trims and shaves very well.</li>
    <li> Easy to handle easy to use, always used Wahl products, quick interchangeable heads, convenient charger stand, meets my expectations I love it</li>
    <li> When you have a product that can do so much that you can&#x27;t find what next to do, as such it is with this item. This machine has replaced my other grooming equipment COMPLETELY.</li>
    <li> This item was great item at the start but now the battery doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge to long. I would pass on this item or buy a corded trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these Wahl body trimmers (same model) in the last 4 years. They both eventually died, completely. The battery stopped holding a charge no matter how long it would be plugged-in for. I would typically write this off as a fluke but given that they both had the same problem within such a short period of time, it&#x27;s hard to say that there isn&#x27;t some sort of product flaw. I ended up buying some higher end Wahl trimmers that are plug-in based that were highly reviewed and so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this set for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The blades rust really easily. No matter how well I took care of them, both sets that I bought ended up rusting.&lt;br /&gt;2. The &amp;#34;organizing&amp;#34; set is useless in my opinion. It&#x27;s clunky and not functional or logical.&lt;br /&gt;3. MOST IMPORTANTLY, the rechargeable battery will eventually die within a 1 to 2 year timespan rendering the razor useless due to the fact that it cannot be used unless the battery is charged. (you cannot plug in and use...this is a major flaw that many other rechargeable razors have as well, not just Wahl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Probably ok for minimal clean up, but not really a &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; trimmer. Did replace with Phillips which was made for men&#x27;s bodies. Got nicked in a sensitive area -- ouch.</li>
    <li> This is not the best product but it sure does it job. Its not very functional for the hair removal on the body as it takes quite a bit and repeated attempts to remove hair. It is a relatively inexpensive option for men. He wasnt exactly super thrilled but it worked.</li>
