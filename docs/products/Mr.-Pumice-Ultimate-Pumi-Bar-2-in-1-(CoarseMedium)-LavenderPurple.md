      <li>Amazon has the absolute best price on this.  </li>
      <li>nice to have the two textures on one bar.  </li>
      <li>If you need to get a callous off just take a warm shower and use one of these puppies and they will scratch off that thing in no time at all.</li>
      <li>and my feet stay looking their absolute best.</li>
      <li>I find it works best when I use it at the very end of my shower.</li>

      <li>The best I ever used by far.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I saw that many nail salons use this specific pumice and I decided to get it. It is definitely worth the $3 it makes your feet very smooth after using a hath foot file.</li>
    <li> It works great! I have no complaints. It saves you from going to get your done feet professionally; which is great of your on a budget or busy.</li>
    <li> Love the pumice bar and it really helps me keep my feet much softer, especially during the summer months where it is so dry here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using pumice stones to obsessively exfoliate my feet for years. I lost my last one (which I&#x27;d had for the last 4 years) and wanted to try this out.    I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s made out of--plastic? Foam? It&#x27;s awful. Sure, it exfoliates, but it feels like I&#x27;m scratching my skin. Little bits of purple stuff come off into the tub.    My REAL pumice stones (new one included) have all been phenomenal. You can boil them to disinfect them. I can pumice the fragile skin on the top of my foot and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. I can go to town on my heel and it comes out soft as butter and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. That&#x27;s what a pumice stone SHOULD do.    Don&#x27;t waste your money with a cheap, scratchy thing that crumbles with each use. Spend your money to buy a REAL pumice stone and it&#x27;ll last a long time and do a better job.</li>
    <li> Great to use with a little soap on a callus. It gets heels super soft. An excellent at home  remedy for rough feet.</li>
    <li> I love this man-made pumice bar.  It does an excellent job of removing the dead skin on the heels of my feet, and it is extra long which allows you to grip the bar easily.  I am going to purchase 10 more of these.  I love them!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a pumice that is course enough to work on heavily calloused feet and hands and this is the one! Not only is the pumice effective but the length of the bar fits my hand well and makes it easy to smooth the bottom of my feet and my heels.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about ten days now.  It has really smoothed out all the yucky dryness of my heels, which can get pretty rough at any time of year.  It&#x27;s an excellent product, and appears to be one that will last a long time!  It&#x27;s really nice to have the coarse on one side, then fine on the other to give the heels and tootsies a polishing buff at the end.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> My heels started getting dry during the summer, and were chaos by the time school started. They weren&#x27;t cracking or flaking, they just looked terribly dry. My heels are naturally sensitive, so I tried this. It worked perfectly! I use this one a week, sometimes once every two weeks, and just end with lotion.    I bought three, one for me, one for my mom - who enjoys it SO much - and one for my best friend (who thought this was a God-given present. She used it with her and her family, and is now asking me to purchase one for her and one for her sister!)    Best pumice bar out there, you will see results IMMEDIATELY and it will save you a trip to the pedicure salon! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I use this product each time I have a foot soak and the dark purple side sloughs off the dead skin effectively.  I highly recommend this item especially if you allow your feet to soak about 10-15 minutes first.  After drying the feet use the other side to smooth then apply foot lotion if you want.</li>
    <li> Living in LA, we are all doomed with the Jesus Feet Syndrome, caused by the constant wearing of flip-flops day in and day out. Until my pedicurist gave me Mr. Pumice as a loyalty present, i had to go back every week because my feet looked like Godzilla&#x27;s paws. Too bad for Vicky the pedicurist, i havent gone back for a pedi ever since she gave it to me.  It&#x27;s the best of the best. it works so well my boyfriend doesnt scream anymore when i rub my feet on his legs before sleep. I feel like a woman again, and i dare to wear pantyhoses again. &#x3D;D hooray</li>
    <li> I live in Florida, wear exclusively open-toed shoes, flip-flops, and walk barefoot in my house with all tile and wood floors. I suffer from clauster-toe-bia so I never wear socks unless I am working out in sneakers, and my feet (especially heels) have long suffered from the dreaded dry, rough, dirty looking, cracked and calloused (not-so-sexy) skin that I usually see on much larger and less hygienic people than myself. This makes it difficult to solicit foot rubs. I get a pedi every 2 weeks or so, and they used to have to break out either the cheese grater or slicer looking implement and go to town! I was always shocked, embarrassed, and kind of impressed how much skin would go flying around, as she tried to hide it in a towel to whisk away. Since I have started using Mr. Pumice, however, NO MORE! My heels and feet have been soft, smooth, clean and rubbable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my last pedi, I started using it every couple of days in the shower. I wait until the end of the shower when my feet are good and water-logged, soap it up, use the rough/dark side first until I see no dirty looking or yucky skin, and smooth it all out with the lighter side.  It just takes a minute. A good tip (from my nail lady) is to put plain old Vaseline on your feet after you are done and dried off. Just don&#x27;t slip on the floor ;) Buy Mr. Pumice and you will never look like a vagrant or dirty hippie again!!!</li>
    <li> These are the best callus care on the market.  I carry them at my shop as they really keep the calluses under control.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! Good price too!</li>
    <li> love this pumice bar.  This is the same one they use at the nail salon in my neighborhood.  They try to sell it to me for  6 bucks glad I found it here.  I will order another one when it get used and abuse.  Keeps your feet smooth.</li>
    <li> This bar works awesome. They use it when I get pedicures and it made my masculine feet feminine again :) So I looked it up on amazon and found it! Now I can maintain the pedicure and save some dough!</li>
    <li> Pumice bar keep my feet very smooth.Try it!</li>
    <li> Its not really stone. Its kind of brittle and weak and it is already starting the fracture. But it is very rough.</li>
    <li> decent. not very different form other bars</li>
    <li> This is the best pumice I have ever used. Cleans your heels and makes them soft. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The Mr. Pumice \\&quot;stone\\&quot; was a waste of money.  It didn&#x27;t work, dropped a lot of granules and made a mess.  The block felt like a piece of flimsy styrofoam. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other pumice stones but this one is by far the best. This is the second time I have ordered it and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> when I recieved this order I did not have high expectations... but it is working great!  my husband uses the coarse side and I use the less coarse side and we are both thrilled.  I am ordering more for my son and daughter.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for in a pumice stone. I felt like I was scraping my feet with this bar</li>
    <li> so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as describled and it is much cheaper than Ebay, good deal when combine with other item with free shippings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Perfect for all my Needs! The product is just as described and worked perfectly.  I now have the smoothest feet!</li>
    <li> What can I say?  this product rules.  I use if for my feet... believe me, my feet were pretty gnarly, dry and flaky.  Use this in the shower and a little lotion afterward and you&#x27;ll be gold.</li>
    <li> There is a box of these sitting in our cupboard below our bathroom sink so I assume these work really well. My wife doesn&#x27;t stock things that aren&#x27;t good. I&#x27;ve used this a few times when I&#x27;ve had an especially rough day and something about scrubbing your feet with the coarse and then fine pumice bar really helps remove the stresses of the day. Plus you get a bunch of that yucky gunk from the bottoms of your feet. And I have a lot of feet to cover.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am always in sandals or flip flops so these are a must. It is true that some this bar will come off while using it. Just rinse and go, not that big of a deal</li>
    <li> i just use my Mr. Pumice for the first time. It is awesome. It works hard on my feet but is very gentle. I am sure I will continue to use it and I look forward to smooth and soft heels :)</li>
    <li> My feet became more scratchy on the bottom.  It didn&#x27;t smooth them out like i was hoping for.  Instead just made them a little worse.</li>
    <li> For an inexpensive product, this pumi bar worked well to relieve my dry, rough heels. You have to work at it a little bit, but it does give good results.</li>
    <li> Job well done with this product.  Definitely smoothed down my feet.  I continue to use it to keep my feet nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than buying it at the nail salon.  I wish it came with a little case, but it does the job it is meant to do.</li>
    <li> Saw these at the nail salon and had to get one.  I love being able to exfoliate in the shower with the different textured sides.</li>
    <li> This is the best pumice I ever ever used. I have tried many pumice stones before and they just didn&#x27;t seem to hold up more than a couple of uses. I have gave this one a good workout and after 3 or so months it is still holding up.</li>
    <li> Got completely rid of my callous and I am well on the way to my summer feet! Used in salons and this is how I heard about this bar of pumice. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I drive all the time, and get calluses on the palms of my hands at the base of my fingers.  I couldn&#x27;t find any way to remove them until I bought this product.  A little soap and warm water, and a scrub or two with a corner of the Mr. Pumice bar, and the calluses are gone.  Repeating every 4-5 days is all I need to do.  I love products that work as advertised!</li>
    <li> The best. Nothing can compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my heels every time I take a shower. When I come out of the shower, I dry my feet and put my favorite lotion on, and then go to bed. When I wake up my feet feel soft and smooth. Best pumice ever. (I&#x27;ve also seen the professionals at the nail salon use this during pedicures!)</li>
    <li> Love this bar!! It does the job and does it well!! Removes callouses and smooths out the area with the other side of the bar. Large size is a bug plus makes it easier to handle in the shower.</li>
    <li> The concept is great, but the surfaces of the bar tend to crumble too easily for my taste. I realized I need to buy the more expensive, actual stone pumice stone from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I will order another one soon. The lavender part really scrubs my feet and the darker purple part makes the skin smooth. I have noticed that it wears down quickly from use and pieces of the darker purple part come off easily, but this is the best pumice stone I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The BEST Pumice I can find. I have been using this kind for YEARS and I love it. My tootsies are always smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve bought another. I love this pumice stone as it is the same brand used in most salons and it works so well!</li>
    <li> Works wonders on dry, cracked heels. I&#x27;m going to buy some spare ones to always have them. Our feet are healed</li>
    <li> Great product and service... Item came quickly and price is right. Pumice bar works wonderful and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this stone and it works as well or better than most I&#x27;ve used. Has a rough side and finishing side.  Not like the pros use but keeps my feet manageable until I get to the pedicure place.</li>
    <li> I love this pumice bar.  I got a pedicure at a salon once, and this is the pumice that was used.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  It works great!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon (so it won&#x27;t say verified purchase) but I always always buy these. They work amazing, and my friends always ask me how my feet are always so smooth looking without me ever going and getting pedicures (I do my own nails). I used to constantly be in the nail salon simply to get my feet scrubbed, and now I&#x27;m never there. I only have to use it once or twice a week, even if I don&#x27;t put lotion on my feet. Yes, like some reviews have said, it does flake and you can&#x27;t really disinfect it, but keep in mind that they are disposable and I&#x27;m sure they were originally made for nail salons, not someone to use at home for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always buy in bulk because it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying one on its own, and I know I&#x27;m going to use them all.</li>
    <li> what it saying on the product amount is not true you don get 12 in a box you get 1 for almost $10.00 so im sending back false advertising.</li>
    <li> It makes your feet sooooo smooth and actually makes it easier to walk because of the calluses. I bought it for my mom but sometimes i borrow it from her, i feel like buying another :)</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Works so good! It&#x27;s the only pumice I&#x27;ll ever buy!</li>
    <li> Mr Pumice likes to eat dead skin. Woohoo for Mr Pumice.&lt;br /&gt;Way better than that egg thing that made me feel like I was using my Parmesan grater on my little piggies...&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, one more bonus, you can wash Mr Pumice off in the shower after you feed him your feet.</li>
    <li> Really does my feet justice! A good scrub and this bar keeps my feet good. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Dont buy it. It is a Hardened Scotch Brite which is used to clean dishes. Its does not feel or look anything like pumice stone which though is hard but it porous and feels soft to the skin. This product is a sham. Cheaply made and if used for long time it will ruin your skin. I wanted to return this and contacted the seller. Never heard back from him. Guess i will contact amazon for my refund money.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! My feet were really dry and hard. After using Mr Pumice I have baby feet again! Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now. Although it took about a month for me to really see noticeable results, I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I still remember how uncomfortable and embarrassed I would be to have bare feet, or have my fiance accidentally touch my feet just because of my dry-deep cracked heels. I&#x27;m not embarrassed anymore, but the memory is still vivid.    The two-sided bar is great and convenient. I find it works best when I use it at the very end of my shower. Tiny dab of liquid body wash (forget trying to maintain a separate foot scrub/wash on hand) on the coarser side, scrub heels for about 30 seconds, rinse feet then followed with the finer side if needed. I do this 1-2 times a week. Lotion heels everyday! TA-DA!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I definitely prefer it over a &amp;#34;stone&amp;#34; and found that it works fantastic on my heels.</li>
    <li> Not very abrasive, even after a full minute of scrubbing there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much surface improvement.  Little bits keep falling off when I scrub my feet.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin on my feet so a pumice stone is a must for me.  I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds but always come back to this one.  It&#x27;s simple but effective and leaves my feet feeling smooth.  I never use the dark purple side since it&#x27;s rougher than I need so I wish they would make one with only the light purple on both sides but they are so inexpensive it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.</li>
    <li> This pumice stone is the bomb!  I love it! It definitely gets the job done!  My feet are super soft! No more hiding them in socks lol</li>
    <li> Work well for keeping the soles of the feet smoother, without being too rough.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend - these bars are magical. I have been trying different pumice tools for years and these are by far the best.. I have found my favorite pumice tool!  But buy the bulk pack for sure as they can wear down more quickly depending on how hard you scrub.</li>
    <li> I use Mr. Pumice Pumi Bar to get the thick cracking callouses off the balls of the heels of my feet. They work 100% of the time. I buy them in boxes of twelve I love them so much! If you need to get a callous off just take a warm shower and use one of these puppies and they will scratch off that thing in no time at all. I had positive results the first time I used them! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was looking at the metal scraper things for your feet and amazon recommended this product. it was way cheaper so I got it instead to give it a shot. I had tried similar things that didn&#x27;t work well so i wasn&#x27;t expecting much. but this thing is amazing!!!! nothing has ever gotten my feet so smooth. just follow the directions and you will love it! you should soak your feet first though, I recommend letting the water collect in the tub while you take a shower that way your whole feet can soak while you clean! then when you get out you can scrub away ur elephant heels with this thing, that&#x27;s whwat i do and it works great!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product very much! I don&#x27;t have a lot of callous on my feet to begin with, but Mr. Pumice didn&#x27;t make my feet feel any smoother. Nice try, but 2 thumbs down.</li>
    <li> the best foot pumice on earth!</li>
    <li> Give yourself a great pedicure!</li>
    <li> These work pretty well if you keep up a routine with them.  The only down side is that the dark purple side sheds little scrubby beads like nobody&#x27;s business.  I definitely recommend doing this in the shower so hat the mess can easily be contained and rinsed away.</li>
    <li> I love Mr. Pumice. I use it every time I take a shower. They wear out and the are disposable... So dont expect it to last forever. It works great on my feet as well as my moms. she has very dry cracked heels and i have realitivly soft feet... but i get dry from time to time. But I love this product.</li>
    <li> I RARELY write reviews because most products are mediocre. Mr. Pumice is amazing! I walk barefoot in my home everyday and even though I try to wear sandals, running after 2 little ones keeps my occupied! My feet get callused easily and this pumice removed A LOT of my calluses with only 1 use. Great product that I will definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome!  It&#x27;s the best pumice stone type product I have ever used!  I love it!  One side is softer than the other, the two sides work great together.</li>
    <li> A family member of mine recommended this bar to me. After one quick use, my heels feel a thousand times better! I also didn&#x27;t notice it falling apart in the bath like some have reported. I&#x27;ve tried tons of pumices and they&#x27;re all thin or poor quality (break in half or don&#x27;t work at all), but this one was so easy to hold/ use and worked so well! I was really impressed with it and will recommend it to everyone. :)</li>
    <li> This pumice bar is very well made and does exactly what it is supposed to do by keeping the skin on the heels from drying out and cracking. Easy to use, lasts through lots of uses.</li>
    <li> I first tried out the product at my sister-in-law&#x27;s house and was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;The product has a long lifetime and is so cheap,i would recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a long, cold winter and feet that had been in boots for months. I came back to California, and my feet needed some serious therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Pumice was a success. I like this two sided bar because some parts of my foot are softer than others, and the dark purple can get too rough on my sensitive tootsies. Yes, there was purple shedding everywhere, but what do you expect from this kind of material? Honestly, that doesn&#x27;t bother me as long as the scrubber works and lasts a reasonable amount of time, which it did.</li>
    <li> The best I ever used by far.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the same kind of scrubber my nail salon uses, and found it here.  I&#x27;ve used standard pumice stones for years now and they just don&#x27;t work as well as Mr. Pumice does.  I have happy, soft feet now.</li>
    <li> It does what its suppose to! softens and exfoliates, I like that there are two sides with different textures. I used softer side first and then the rougher side after to get good results</li>
    <li> The product itself is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;My heel became smooth immediately! It&#x27;s not necessary to use cream.&lt;br /&gt;Just rub your heel with the Pumice bar in the shower, and you&#x27;re set to go!</li>
    <li> I shower, then I wet this under the water with a cleansing gel and gently exfoliate my heels. After drying my feet well, I use the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Overnight Foot Cream for Her. My dry heels are gone and the heel cracks are almost totally healed. I highly recommend this product and then use the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s for Her!</li>
    <li> Amazon has the absolute best price on this.  Wife loves this thing, says it keeps her feet smooth..and I agree :)</li>
    <li> THIS PUMICE BAR WAS GOOD.  ITS WHAT I EXP[ECTED, DOES THE JOB WELL.  MR. PUMICE IS REALY GREAT FOR PEDICURES WHEN Y WANT TO FINISH OFF THE CLIENTS FEET.  IT LEAVE IT NICE AND SMOOTH.</li>
    <li> I wanted a pumice stone and it works the way it supposed to. I use it while in the shower and my feet are free of dry flaky skin.</li>
    <li> I love these bars!  The screen on the heels of my feet were very dry and coarse.  This pumice bar healed them, and now they are very smooth.</li>
    <li> this pumice bar seemed really breaky when i received it. like it would only have a few uses before completely dissolving away. its good for the $1 price, but if you want some real foot scrubbing, get a real stone. they work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have never used this product or any other scrubbers personally. After this winter i noticed more cracked scratchy hands/ feet.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason i went with this was because i remember my parents using bars on their feet years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing! since this is a larger box I gave it to both my parents, wife and a friend and it completely helps with the scruffy heels.&lt;br /&gt;I cant stand when my feet grab carpet and other fibers and with this it feels just like getting a pedi.</li>
    <li> nice to have the two textures on one bar.  i like the easy-to-handle size and would definitely get another one once this one is worn away.</li>
    <li> Other reviews said it crumpled, but I have had for months and love it. It has not crumpled at all and is a great product</li>
    <li> Mr. Pumice worked better than any other product I have tried for removing calluses and dry skin on my heels and feet.  After using it only once all the dry rough skin is gone and my feet so much softer.  I also really didn&#x27;t have to scrub very hard or for too long to get these results.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for this and switched to a real pumice stone.  The little blue things rubbed off all over the place and wasn&#x27;t as soft on my skin as the real stones.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it you can get a pedicure, but they aren&#x27;t going to allow you to soak your feet as long as they need to be in order for you to get the results you want. What happens if you decide to run water in your bathtub and soak your feet until they get all wrinkled then you put ProLinc Callus Eliminator on it and use your Mr. Pumice? Guess what your feet will turn out better than they would if you paid $35 to sit in a chair for 11 minutes while being exposed to germs from other patrons that were clearly not eliminated from everything. I started doing pedicures at home to save money when I realized I was never completely satisfied unless I did it myself now you can too by using the same tools that the pros use in the privacy of your own home!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as my old style pumice stone did.  I have to do A LOT more scrubbing to get the stains under the rim of the toilet bowls off.  The part I have the most problem with is the awful noise it makes against the porcelain.  Holy cow.  Fingernails on a chalkboard (through a loud speaker).  If I can&#x27;t figure out a way to use it that&#x27;s quieter, I won&#x27;t be able to use it at all.  As for the extra scrubbing effort needed, well.... it&#x27;ll build more muscle and burn more calories.  I can live with that.  If you have hyperacusis (like me), or are looking for a quick, easy way to clean the procelain throne, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.  If you want a good workout and don&#x27;t mind the noise.... go for it.</li>
    <li> There is nothing like this product for \\&quot;callus management\\&quot;.  If you collect cute sandals, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with some callus remover that was recommend on Amazon. I thought it would be more feet friendly than it was. The dark purple side is like rubbing your foot with a very scratchy rock and the less abrasive side crumbles off as your sanding with it. I was concerned the grit would clog my drains since I used it in the tub. I gave it 3 stars being nice because it did sand off the calluses eventually but no better than a regular pumus board. The caustic callous remover that barely worked and this messy, hard block of whatever it is were a waist of money. I guess I will be stuck with my Dr. Scholl sander and just soap and water between pedicures. Live and learn...</li>
    <li> What can I say, It is exactly what I expected. Worked as advertised. I did not expect this to last forever. It is a consumable.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 sided format is a nice boon.  Fast shipping, fair price.  Shame it isnt readily available in your local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> I had a pumice stone that did not do anything for the callouses.&lt;br /&gt;This pumice stone has removed the callouses and now my feet are smooth&lt;br /&gt;without going to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone who has rough skin on your feet&lt;br /&gt;The other side is cool for the rest of the body. It works.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t get the callous&#x27;s off my big toes but it took care of everything else. Good stuff man. Good stuff</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not too rough but rough enough for soft spots on your feet.  This lasted a lot longer than I thought too.  just make sure you rinse your hands so none of the debris gets on your hands and transferred to your face for example.</li>
    <li> This is a huge bang for the buck!!!  I have had many feet scrubbers to remove dry and dead skin.  It seemed to take hours and days to try to get the dead skin off and it didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a dent removing it.  NOTHING compares to Mr. Pumice.  Everything else has been a waste of money.  I had the worst dry, cracked and calloused feet.  I was embarrassed to wear heals or have to take my socks off.  My feet looked the best after a pedicure but it only seemed to last about 5 days and those terrible cracks in my heals were back.  I got Mr. Pumice and scrubbed my feet.  They looked and felt amazing afterwards.  Because my feet were in such bad condition I had missed some spots and scrubbed again the next day.  By the second day my feet were almost as soft and smooth as my 15 month olds feet!!!  I can&#x27;t remember my feet ever looking or feeling this good!  I am not embarrassed to show off my feet anymore. LOVE this product.  So worth the $3.00!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months now (It truly is durable); you get a sense that this product is of good quality when pieces of pumice aren&#x27;t falling apart during exfoliation and you get tiny-crumbed pumice everywhere. I tried other brands before and there was more of the product in my shower than on me; so &#x60;Mr. Pumice Two Sided Ultimate Pumice Bar&#x27; truly lives up to its name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution. Do NOT use this product other than the soles of your foot! I was pre-warned by my usual nail technician at my local nail salon not to scrub too harsh or use other than the soles of your foot, but failed to heed to her advice she&#x27;d previously given me. I was so elated to have the option of cutting back between my typical every two weeks regiment and to be able to have spa quality treatments from the comfort of my home. I am an avid believer of maintaining healthy, looking feet just as equally as you would care for your nails, hair and skin that I completely was of my own ignorance and boy did I pay the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did wrong was I used it dry without first soaking it in warm water and in addition I was too rough with the Mr. Pumice and it slit various parts of the &#x27;fleshy&#x27; sides of my skin, foot, and ankle/back of feet.  It took pain-staking months of trial and error before getting my feet back in order as it was quite cumbersome due to the constant itch, and dryness. It is very important to always follow through with some sort of a moisturizer and to keep your feet conditioned throughout the day especially after using this or any type of abrasive product on your skin. Our foot tends to get over-looked than conventional body parts (face and body), it is for that reason we never-truly see the value of how important it is to take care of the foot. It has been passed down for many centuries through the Asian culture and medicine the feet is the core to the whole entire body and ultimately you can detect any ailments through special pressure points in the left and right foot also known as &#x60;Acupuncture.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was sharing earlier I have no one else to blame but myself as I was applying too much pressure and scrubbing way too constant. That part of your foot is very tender and should be treated as such (I highly recommend only using about 2x&#x27;s a week) and not on a daily basis as I was doing; what can I say, I was addicted and wanted to try it with my various foot scrubs/creams. This product is not a toy and should only be used by adults only. This is ideal between trips to the spa or your local nail shops. I am much more careful how I use it now and my feet stay looking their absolute best. This is great if you&#x27;re trying to budget or simply want to maintain that between appointments spa treatment/feeling in the comfort of your home (as I was going every 2-weeks; some time 3x&#x27;s a week), now I go in half the time but there&#x27;s nothing like being pampered by a seasoned professional. There is a reason why these people go to school to learn the proper care and usage of these devices and I highly would suggest that you ask questions first before ever moving forward on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little added secret (Shhhhhh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Local nail shops probably don&#x27;t want me telling you this but use (Callus Remover by Spa Redi - $4.99 - on-line) - it&#x27;s a leave-on treatment that you leave-on for about 2-minutes, and then rinse off. This is the exact product that they use at the shops. I also recommend for giving your feet that &#x27;EXTRA&#x27; special touch: wrap in a nice warm-towel and then place in a plastic bag (no worries your local supermarket bags will suffice) for about 2-3 minutes and then rinse...talk about WOWWWIIIIEEE! Your foot is going to feel like dancing; so put on that \\&quot;freak&#x27;n dress on\\&quot; like Mrs. Beyonce Knowles recommends and you&#x27;re all set to go out on a night on the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-Sided Pumice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a reason why it is referenced to having two sides. I&#x27;ve touched on the course side now I will briefly talk about the reverse side of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never use to pay much attention to the smooth side of the pumice I just thought what difference does it make; and besides I had spent enough time in the shower and was often rushing to get it over with; and because I am now considered an expert at using &#x60;Mr. Pumice Two Sided Ultimate Pumice Bar&#x27; I only spend about 1-2 minutes per feet and I&#x27;m done; especially if your just maintaining between your regular appointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until a recent visit and learning my regular girl is no longer working there (I was devastated!); I just wanted to get it over with but boy-o-boy was I in for a pleasant surprise; this female was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! I honestly never thought in my wildest dream she could surpass my usual girl I&#x27;ve used for several years; and in the process learned quite a bit about using the flat side of the pumice un-like my previous girl who didn&#x27;t spend much time using it. This female we&#x27;ll call her &#x60;Sue&#x27; used the level-side as equally as with the rough-side. She used it with much tender and care (NOT!!!); Sue, was working that pumice! I sat pleasantly surprise with my tongue to the ground. She rubbed it back and forth; flipped it side-side (my feet that is), and then put my feet back into the spa whirlpool and started to scrub it while having it emerged underneath the water. She was on a mission to have me as a returning customer and I honestly could tell she loved her job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is this chick?! I was in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesson learned is that the smooth side is just as equally of important as the coarse side and will leave your foot feeling as soft as butter. So don&#x27;t skip corners ladies or males (hey, its 2013 you just never know), the bottom line is there is a reason why it is considered a double-sided product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves a little &#x60;secret-tip-bit&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Another little added secret. If you can go to any spa or nail salon go Monday-Wednesday&#x27;s -vs- on the Weekend!!! Ask for the lower cost scrub/session and typically they will ALWAYS UPGRADE you to the next pricing scrub or even do a combination of ALL the higher scrubs/sessions; they&#x27;re desperate for sales during these days and most of the time you will be the only person there or maybe 1-2 others at best. This is the time for them to get to know you and over a period of time you can ask &#x60;on the sly&#x27; to buy their &#x60;Mr. Pumice&#x27; stone directly from the shop; mine only charges me $5 but remember you&#x27;re not paying for any shipping cost; I also only use my OWN supplies minus the nail polish (cut down on bacteria and such).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail salon I go too they typically will always UPGRADE my tools when they&#x27;re going bad with a brand new one for FREE (now, I&#x27;m not saying yours will do the same so keep that in mind). There are major-major benefits of going on their OFF-days. They will share major tip-bits with you on how to maintain your feet as well as which products to buy. Make sure you talk with someone who can speak good English; not like &#x60;Sue&#x27; who knew bout 1-2 words, and finally, the minimum they will spend on my feet is about an hour and 40-45minutes and no, it&#x27;s not because I have horribly bad feet (because I don&#x27;t); it&#x27;s because of all the EXTRAS they throw in for FREE; keep your mouth closed, sit back and you will get the works! But please make sure to tip your technician well; she or he deserves it (I some time bring my regular-girl some lunch from a nearby fast food restaurant), the look on her face as they say is....PRICELESS! :-); they&#x27;ve earned it and your foot is the result of a job well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closure:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Remember to only use &#x60;Mr. Pumice Two Sided Ultimate Pumice Bar&#x27; wet NOT dry to apply; I make it a regular regiment while showering; add your favorite foot ointments; remember, you don&#x27;t want to overdo it; it is like using steel wool on your feet so go easy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(HeelTo Toe: Spa Pedicure Collection - Exfoliating &amp; Polishing Foot Scrub)&lt;br /&gt; ** Buy at (Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply) - On-line $6.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Review has been brought to you by &#x27;Awakened1&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** See all my reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34AZ5B6CCBLPN/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;sort_by&#x3D;MostRecentReview</li>
    <li> I love this Pumice bar.  It is exactly what my poor tired feet needed.  No need to go to the salon as often!!!!</li>
    <li> I often neglect my feet in the winter when I am not getting regular pedicures. Then I end up with really cracked heels. Using this product I have super smooth  and soft heels. (I also am putting Heel Cream on after using the pumice sponge.)</li>
    <li> This stone really gets the job done. Soak your feet for a few minutes, then scrub away the build-up. Oh! Make sure you keep track of it when visiting relatives. I visited my Mom and mysteriously came home without it!</li>
    <li> Eh, just buy a sanding block from Home Depot or Lowe&#x27;s, or better yet, buy a &amp;#34;corn plane&amp;#34; and make fast work of calluses.  I am a CrossFit &amp; Kettle-bell trainer and get callused pretty well and would recommend the corn plane over Pumi bar any day.</li>
    <li> Love these. If you need a pumice GET THIS ONE. I&#x27;ve tried many and always go back to this one</li>
    <li> The Mr. Pumice Two Sided Ultimate Pumice Bar works well.  Replaced my old one and will continue to use these.  Have an issue with foot callus and use of these help keep them pretty smooth. Having two sides saves space and makes it very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Product did its job, good price and would order again when time comes. . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I love these and found that many salons use them. One thing I don&#x27;t like is the grainy mess they leave behnd. I usually sit on the edge of the tub when I use them, so I can just wash it down the drain.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product last spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 4 more, only to find that they were not as coarse as the first product I ordered. They package looked the same, but once I opened it up, the \\&quot;coarse\\&quot; side felt just like the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; side. Bummed I can&#x27;t return since I opened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could find the same ones I ordered originally!</li>
    <li> Left purple stuff everywhere, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love this pumice bar, i use it mainly in the summer, every time when i take shower and the results are amazing. You still need to put some cream at night to soften the skin but this bar helps with the roughest stuff.</li>
    <li> Before I try this product I try many , and nothing did it like this foot scuber I recommend you give this a try you will not regret it it save my feet thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this product. If I could give more stars I would. Works wonders on my feet. Really keeps the calluses  away.</li>
    <li> This is a good pumice bar, but be careful with the coarse side. I have a lot of callous resulting from living in an arrid climate, i.e., desert! Got a little too aggressive and foot bled. Always use this type of bar on wet, lathered foot, not dry skin. If you have heavy callous, consider buying a rasp, more specifically, a microplane rasp. This manufacturer makes the best available, suitable for gals and guys. I&#x27;ve bought so many products for my pathetic feet and when it comes to callous, think microplane rasp!</li>
    <li> I love this two sided pumice bar! I accidentally ordered the one sided one also, but this is the best one ever!!</li>
    <li> I bar, not 12 count as in the description. Also, this is a synthetic material, not real pumice.The dark side is probably too coarse for most skin, and it crumbles. The lighter side is fine and works well.</li>
    <li> works great and it&#x27;s the same kind they use in the nail salons</li>
    <li> It really helped my feet and it is so much gentler than pumice stone I used in the past and less painful in fact none at all with this bar.</li>
    <li> I use this product like three times per week, I will put some cream after and it helps mantain my feet smoother. Great price too</li>
