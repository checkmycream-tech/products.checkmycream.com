      <li>I mixed some with their carrot oil, and that actually worked okay (using more carrot oil than argan).</li>
      <li>with this said the first 4 ingredients are silicones.</li>
      <li>/&gt;DO YOUR RESEARCH FIRST</li>
      <li>, if you don&#x27;t know much about ingredient lists you should know that the first ingredient is abundant, and the last is less abundant.</li>
      <li>Though I had nice results with the spray mixture, its not worth the price tag.</li>
      <li>/&gt;  provides intense conditioning</li>

      <li>hair feels soft and shiny.</li>

      <li>My hair is back healthy again, past the middle of my back, and in the front it covers my chest.</li>
      <li>the lingered in hair, not pure argan oil, much regret should not have purchased )-;</li>
      <li>Know that silicones can be good and bad for natural hair it helps with shine and moisture but</li>
      <li>It provides protection so the hair does not dry</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much thicker than Garnier Fructis&#x27; oil (which I tried first), and it has an annoying stickiness to it that can easily ruin a finished style.</li>
      <li>My hair has had lots of damage from previous perms and dyes, but since I&#x27;ve started using this stuff about a year ago, I&#x27;ve had so much growth, it&#x27;s unreal.</li>
      <li>It has completely changed my hair (softer, less breakage, &amp; natural).</li>
      <li>But I prefer the results I get with their olive oil; it adds the same shine, without so much of an oily, sticky mess.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I only use Hollywood Beauty Argan oil to keep my hair, soft, shining and smelling fruity delicious.</li>
    <li> The first thing I disliked was the smell, it has a super fruity scent that reminds me of an 8th grade girl&#x27;s body spray. The product also feels like it has a lot of something in it that&#x27;s not argan oil, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> KNOW WHAT YOU ARE BUYING.&lt;br /&gt;I am huge on the ingredients in products, so with this said the first 4 ingredients are silicones. Know that silicones can be good and bad for natural hair it helps with shine and moisture but it can also cause great build up and prevent moisture.&lt;br /&gt;(there are several cones out there)&lt;br /&gt;DO YOUR RESEARCH FIRST ON INGREDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 4 years natural hair below bra strap I use mostly all homemade organic products. I just wanted something that smells fruity in my hair from time to time. ARGAIN OIL IS THE 6th INGREDIENT, if you don&#x27;t know much about ingredient lists you should know that the first ingredient is abundant, and the last is less abundant. I hope that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very simple I bought the product from CVS I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I rubbed some in on my fingers.  Yes, it is heavy in silicones be cautious with amount of product used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT HELPING FRIZZ, IT HELPS WITH:&lt;br /&gt;  stopping breakage and split ends&lt;br /&gt;  provides intense conditioning&lt;br /&gt;  absorbs instantly&lt;br /&gt;  no greasy residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product because of the smell and that is it.  Will I buy again? IF I CAN FIND A CHEAPER PRODUCT THAT SMELLS THIS NICE &amp; STRONG &amp; LAST LONGING, BUT DOESN&#x27;T COST THIS MUCH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in no way saying it does what it says I have not used it.&lt;br /&gt;-J.Ginn</li>
    <li> I dislike the fact that one of my bottles leaked all thru out my package. otherwise I luv the product. Sadly, much of it went to waste. I won&#x27;t be ordering this via amazon.</li>
    <li> Absorbs readily.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a terrific shine</li>
    <li> IT SMELLS LIKE GRAPE SODA.. ITS OBVS. FAKE ARGAN OIL. I WOULDN&#x27;T PURCHASE THIS FOR MY ENEMY. IM STILL WAITING FOR A LIL MORE HAIR GROWTH THO</li>
    <li> I love! this oil, the scent is wonderful. Full, deep, warm, slightly woodsy, ever so slightly flowery. My husband loves to play with my hair when I use it. At the same time, I wear Michael Kors&#x27; perfume, which has a lovely top note of tuberose, and the two go together marvelously. It imparts a subtle shine to my hair, lingers for hours. Use just a dime-size on your hair, the bottle lasts.</li>
    <li> makes your hair feel awesome.....I put it on before I go to sleep and wash out the next day. hair feels soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love Hollywood Beauty products, and most of them work very well for me.  But this argan oil treatment was a disappointment. It wasn&#x27;t too bad for use before blow drying, but on dry hair it&#x27;s even worse. It&#x27;s much thicker than Garnier Fructis&#x27; oil (which I tried first), and it has an annoying stickiness to it that can easily ruin a finished style. I mixed some with their carrot oil, and that actually worked okay (using more carrot oil than argan). I can&#x27;t use either on its own, so I&#x27;ll just mix them together for now.  But I prefer the results I get with their olive oil; it adds the same shine, without so much of an oily, sticky mess. I only wish they sold all their oils in bigger bottles...never understood why they don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how I feel about the scent. It smells like grape</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my friend in the beauty supply store.  I think I paid about $8.00 for it.  Hmm...honestly beyond the scent I didn&#x27;t really like it.  It supposed to be applied after shampooing to condition hair.  I didn&#x27;t see any results.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel moisturized.  My daughter&#x27;s hair had the same results.  I was surprised because I actually like Hollywood Beauty&#x27;s Carrot Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I always try to give a product a chance, I decided to mix it with water for spraying my daughter&#x27;s hair when I braid it.  Here I had better results.  The Argan Oil/Water mix made her hair easier to detangle and her braid outs came out smoother and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase again? No.  Though I had nice results with the spray mixture, its not worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> This has a very nice smell it also does a good job of sealing split ends. A little goes along way, I love all of Hollywood products. They are made from the finest oils to protect and condition your hair.</li>
    <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I use this oil moisturize my 12 year daughter&#x27;s natural hair. Sometimes I mix it with coconut oil to lather her hair each night</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this in his hair.  It provides protection so the hair does not dry and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all.  It does not build up on the hair either.  Just  a dime size will do on short hair.  Will probably continue to order this.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer stated, argan oil is way down the list of ingredients. With that being said, I absolutely love the smell of this product and that is why I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It made my hair look more dirty and oily than it would if I didn&#x27;t wash it for a week. very sticky. I used a different brand before and never had my hair look oily. Quite a disappointment.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair treatment oil that I have ever used.  I have been using it for a long time now.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff &amp; I like the smell too, it&#x27;s not weird to me like other oils that I&#x27;ve used before. My hair has had lots of damage from previous perms and dyes, but since I&#x27;ve started using this stuff about a year ago, I&#x27;ve had so much growth, it&#x27;s unreal. My hair is back healthy again, past the middle of my back, and in the front it covers my chest. When I wear it down people can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s all mine. LOL So yeah I&#x27;m going to always use this, not too much though, because it can feel heavy if you overdo it. I rub this in my scalp after my weekly co-washing using the Hollywood Argon oil conditioner. I then mix a few drops of tea tree oil, coconut oil and Cantu Argon Oil leave in conditioner product- with water, and spritz away. (It&#x27;s a great leave in conditioner method that works for me). That hair will be juicy with moisture, and your ends will be sealed so good, you won&#x27;t have to worry about terrible breakage.</li>
    <li> horrible cough drop cherry smell the lingered in hair, not pure argan oil, much regret should not have purchased )-;</li>
    <li> The Argan oil make miracle on long hairs&lt;br /&gt;Only to recommend</li>
    <li> This is one the best products for hair I&#x27;ve ever used. When it ran out at our beauty supply store, I knew I would find it here on Amazon.com. I&#x27;m so glad I could.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for your hair. Great treatment! It has completely changed my hair (softer, less breakage, &amp; natural). I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Gives my hair a smooth and healthy touch.</li>
