    <li> It smells great and the wife really likes it.  Good job Avon.</li>
    <li> Really smells better than some of the really expensive colognes.  Really yummy cologne and not overpowering.  My wife really loves it.</li>
    <li> Really like this cologne. The spray bottle is handy, and its got a nice pleaseing smell to it, not to over powering like some. I will definletly purchase some more when I run out of it.</li>
    <li> i love the smell looking for same deal i will buy more</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne. Truly, the smell, the freshness and aroma scent it spreads around is almost addicting. It&#x27;s so good that you can&#x27;t stop smelling it.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I imagined. It&#x27;s a little strong for me, kinda musky.</li>
    <li> I am using this cologne since a long time and I still feel freshness in its fragrance. About in 1998 my cousin gift me and since today its been my one of favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrant, I use it all the time.Need to order some more soon, about to run out.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite cologne</li>
    <li> I had originally purchased this perfume in the form of a gift set for my oldest son and he loved it.  When he ran out he asked me to get it for him and I&#x27;m happy to say that Amazon beat Avon&#x27;s price and free shipping too.</li>
    <li> Special request from my Dad...he only wears this!</li>
    <li> You want compliments, get this.</li>
    <li> It smells great on him.  For the price it is such a wonderful fragrance.  He loves it.  He wheres it everyday.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne for my boyfriend because I fell IN LOVE with the smell! The package shipped super quick and was padded to ensure the glass bottle wouldnt crack. The smell lasts all day long, and then some. I was very satisfied with this product and I will definitely re-order in the future!</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived broken and it cost me more to return it than what it was worth...</li>
    <li> great smelling product to fit any occosion and will continue ordering when this orde run out. Good stuff after a hard days work.</li>
    <li> got it on time and enjoying it</li>
    <li> What is that lovely smell is the comment I get from the ladies. Need I say more? Avon has another winner. This cologne is smokin&#x27;.My expectations were exceeded by far.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great and isn&#x27;t too strong. What sucks is that the smell doesn&#x27;t really last that long.</li>
    <li> best scent ever! been using it for 8 years now</li>
    <li> Mesmerize is a citrus aromatic fragrance for men and includes hints of mandarin orange, apple and bergamot with some spices, myrrh, amber and woodsy notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my brother&#x27;s favorite cologne. For me, although not my favorite, is a good daily wearing cologne that isn&#x27;t too overpowering but gives you a good lasting smell all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is to make sure of the seller you are buying as with any colognes and perfumes, there are lots of counterfeits, a normal price is 12 to 20 bucks, so if it is a deal too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
    <li> Avon is well known for its high quality products.  This cologne is no exception.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments on this cologne.  With the incredible values for this item on Amazon, there is no need to buy higher priced cologne at department stores (or even at Wal Mart).</li>
    <li> Great product, fair price.</li>
    <li> I really liked this when I used to purchase directly from an Avon rep.  I&#x27;m not convinced this is the same.</li>
    <li> This is my personal scent.</li>
    <li> Saved money!!!!! And, although I gave the wrong city and it was returned- the seller was very attentive to my dilemma!!!! Thank you again!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product I brought it for my uncle who loves this cologne for men. Not to mention the seller is amazing got my package right on time and was in perfect conditon. I recommend this seller and I will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> Love it! I have used it often before (bought from a woman who worked at my office), but I have not been able to buy until I found it online. Thank you. I always get great compliments when I wear this cologne. My favorite of those in this price range. I would buy again, and again, and again — as needed. I do use it nearly every day.</li>
    <li> I do not wear many clones but this is pretty good</li>
    <li> My first purchase of this was a used bottle from Goodwill just to try it out.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from Avon, but was very surprised that I actually like this fragrance for an everyday cologne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a good deal several months ago from someone online so I bought THREE full bottles which will last me several years (or I may give some away as presents).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent job, Avon!</li>
    <li> This cologne is pretty good. To me it is a little strong at first. But it does have kinda a light fruity woody smell. This will probably only be a cologne I use during the winter. It is kinda strange, but this cologne smells a whole lot more upscale than some of the other so called upscale colognes I have smelled. Would go good with like dress clothes, doesn&#x27;t really smell like a lounging all around cologne. Don&#x27;t regret purchasing though. I will have this bottle for like 15 years! Alot of people say they still have this from a decade ago and it is still stable! Can&#x27;t beat the price though.</li>
    <li> fast shipping good item</li>
    <li> price was great, product smells OK but not my fave....def&#x27;ly my choice for his go-to-work cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;four more words....gotcha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STUPID REQUIREMENT</li>
    <li> GOOD PACKAGING. NICE VALUE. HAS GOOD FRAGRANCE. NOT TOO POWERFUL.  AVON QUALITY. FAST SHIPMENT. WOULD BUY AGAIN. WOULD TRY OTHER AVON PRODUCTS</li>
    <li> Best cologne I&#x27;ve tried in years.</li>
    <li> excellent purchase. thank you.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!!!</li>
    <li> The only cologne I use and have for years...inexpensive and smells great</li>
    <li> I was given a bottle of this cologne about 12 years ago by a friend. At first I didn&#x27;t even try it because its an Avon product and In thought it was weird for a guy to have Acon cologne. Well its 12 years later and its then only cologne In use. I get complements on it often. I guess that means it doesn&#x27;t stink so who cares if its from Avon. I like it and recommend it quite a lot. I&#x27;ve even given it as a gift myself. Great for in-laws , brothers , sons, or whoever.</li>
    <li> product conforms to the description ok recommend to all</li>
    <li> value for the dollar. why spend 50 to 100 dollars. when you can get a superior product from Avon for far less&lt;br /&gt;exceeded my expectations I will be a returning customer for a long time</li>
    <li> Came with a broke pump. Didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with purchase!! Arrived on time!</li>
    <li> love it smells wonderful and the bottle is a beautiful blue with a gold top</li>
    <li> Good buy....nice fragrance...</li>
    <li> good price and good product sexy aroma makes you want to  have a grand evening with the one who wears it</li>
    <li> I have determined that this is not an authentic Avon product.  It is a knock off so who knows what the contents are so it goes in the garbage.  We contacted Avon and there should be an identifier on the bottom of the bottle indicating pertinent information.  None on this bottle.  It does appear on another bottle we have.  I have seen many other comments on Amazon as to knock off products so it appears this is not unusual.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good i like it and the price it right i would buy again for sure one of avons best</li>
    <li> I wear  this since long time and I am verymuch familliar with the odor.&lt;br /&gt;So with confidence, I cna say it does not smell and last like original from Avon.</li>
    <li> this was a gift..giftee loves fragrance..very nice</li>
    <li> my lover love it so we be back</li>
    <li> I was use this item when I was in Egypt and finally I found it here and soo cheap it&#x27;s really perfect perfum</li>
    <li> Like the smell of it and it lasts longer than other colognes I have tried that are more expensive.</li>
    <li> Great smell, beats all the prices! :)</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned I received a generic substitute from this seller.  First, the scent is very watered down...it&#x27;s almost as if I am spraying water on myself.  I compared the scent from the tap of an existing bottle I have that is very nearly empty, and the tap from the new bottle...very different.  Second, under the Mesmerize label...my existing bottle says &amp;#34;For Men / Pour homme&amp;#34;, whereas the new bottle does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would enjoy communication regarding this disappointing product.</li>
    <li> I recommend this cologne to any man out there who wants to attract the ladies. Girls loved the scent it gave off.</li>
    <li> I love this men Cologne for so many reasons. It is a very mysterious and sexy sent that last all day. Plus it is not that expensive but smells like a billion dollars. My husband will put it on in the morning and when he comes home from work I will hug him. He still smells great. This is the best men&#x27;s cologne I have ever smelled in my life. More men should wear it. It is very sexy and mysterious and I love it when he smells this way. Even other women love it as well. It is better than any high dollar cologne I can promise you that. If you like to be mysterious this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> This device was defective from day one until could work no more but good thing they accepted it back</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite Cologne--he loves it!</li>
    <li> Avon has had this one around for a long time and I hope they keep making it. I wear it almost every day because it smells great and it&#x27;s not really expensive.</li>
    <li> love this cologne people ask what is the name who makes it</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had this fragrance a few times before and it&#x27;s a very good cologne. THIS item is a knock-off and a waste of money. it&#x27;s a weak,diluted fake like you would find on a street corner,a bootleg. i am very disappointed that this is sold on amazon where,up to now, i&#x27;ve always had good shopping experiences. i won&#x27;t buy any more colognes because now i&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;ll get the real thing or another knock-off.</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT MY HUSBAND WAS LOOKING FOR AND I&#x27;M SO GLAD I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT AND AT A GREAT PRICE.</li>
    <li> My dad loves this cologne. It has a nice, clean scent that stays.</li>
    <li> Very good all the girls love it. And other men ask me what I am wareing so they can get some.</li>
