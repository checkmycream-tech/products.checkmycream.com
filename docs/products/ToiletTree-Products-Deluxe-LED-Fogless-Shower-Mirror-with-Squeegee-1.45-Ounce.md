<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This item fogged up the moment I turned my shower on. Do not waste your money like I did!</li>
    <li> This may be the first truly &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror I&#x27;ve had!  It&#x27;s a bit of a nuisance to fill it with hot water each time, and the squeegee is not terribly effective, but overall it permits me to shave comfortably in the shower.  The razor rest on the bottom is quite handy.</li>
    <li> Not worth $40. More like about $20. Light is pretty useless. Fog-less part works.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Perfect solution. Love the LED  lights and no fog. Crystal clear and easy to install.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  The mirror comes with silicone to glue to the wall but I drilled a couple of small holes in the mounting bracket and used some drywall mollys to mount in my tiled shower stall.  Works great.  Has not fogged yet and is a very clear image.</li>
    <li> ***UPDATED REVIEW 12/8/14***  After receiving a faulty unit initially (see old review below) I reordered and checked the new one over, not finding the flaw I did with the first.  Mounting was easy and simple enough with the pre-attached adhesive strips and tube of silicone.  I cleaned the side of the wall where this would go and mounted according to the instructions, waiting 24 hours before attaching the mirror itself.      This is the second shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;m an avid Headblader, so I&#x27;m using a razor on my face or head nearly every time I&#x27;m in the shower.  The first mirror was round  (~5 in diamter) with a covered LED strip around the edges (dim) and a hanger for the razor below (flimsy, doesn&#x27;t fit all razors); it was mounted using suction cups (which would fail, loudly) and had some kind of anti-fogging chemical applied (which worked for about a month but prevented cleaning afterwards).  I won&#x27;t waste any more time on the deficiencies of that unit, but wanted to include that as narrative for this review.    While only installed for a couple of weeks now, it feels solidly mounted to the wall.  The mirror is nice and large and offers some magnification.  The LED is bright enough to shave from when the bathroom lights are dimmed low, something that can happen on early mornings for me.  Filling the reservoir is a MUST to prevent fogging - it&#x27;s how it works - and I&#x27;ve had no issues with fogging at all.  The attached squeegee can remove water drops easily to keep the surface clear.    Just a couple of minor gripes, though.  While the LED is bright, you really are only using reflected light on your face.  This necessitates me having to lean in very close to the mirror for the LED to light my face or head (not an issue when the lights in the bathroom are on full).  Putting the reservoir back in place can be a bit tricky unless you press your face against the side of the shower wall - it would be nice if it were a little easier (maybe experience or more than 2 weeks will do it?).  Finally, the platform beneath the mirror (the box shows a razor laying on it) is much closer to the bottom of the mirror than that picture indicates.  A bit more room would make it easier getting hands on/off the razor.    In all I&#x27;m very pleased with this mirror compared to my previous one.        ***OLD REVIEW***  Upon receiving (which was as timely as ever) I unboxed and looked everything over to make sure there were no glaring issues.  I noticed the battery cover seemed to have been assembled incorrectly or improperly labeled.  The screw tops were plastic and large enough for fingers and were keyed with a triangle, designed to be a guide to lock or unlock the battery compartment with a simple quarter of a turn.  I noted that one of the screwtops was oriented correctly, pointing at the lock that was closed; the other was 180 degrees off.  I turned the mislabeled one first in the direction that it should go to unlock and it did - other side worked as well.  I placed the batteries and put the cover back on and tightened one screw down, but the misaligned one from earlier didn&#x27;t budge - I had placed it in the \\&quot;correct\\&quot; position per the diagram, opposite what it had been.  I switched it back to where it was oriented and attempted to tighten it down and the screwtop snapped freely from the metal screw it was attached to.    I returned to Amazon, but was a bit dismayed that I could only return and get a refund, not do an exchange.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to give this to my husband for his birthday.  When I finally had time to mount it to the smooth glass shower enclosure wall, I took extra care to follow the directions for prepping the surface with an alcohol prep pad and keeping the shower dry over a weekend to ensure it would stay securely attached. We have hard, ceramic tile floors and if the mount failed, I was certain the mirror would be toast.  My hub loved the mirror. It&#x27;s nice and bright and the pivot made it easy for me to see into it as well, and I&#x27;m a foot shorter than my husband--okay, on my tiptoes. Six or seven months later, I found the mirror on the floor, broken, with all the silicone still on the glass enclosure. So, although liked the mirror very much and it definitely stayed fog free I&#x27;m disappointed that it didn&#x27;t stay securely fasten to the wall. The mirror and lighting, however, really great! Unfortunately, we&#x27;re back to a small, suction cup attached mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror pops off the mount WAY too easily.  I bought it for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day, he seems to like it, but every time he goes to squeegee it off after his shower, it pops off the mount and totally irritates him.  It&#x27;s a shame, because it&#x27;s an otherwise great product.  If you can live with it jumping off the wall, go for it.  It&#x27;s good size, lights up well, does the trick, but that&#x27;s a major flaw that the manufacturers need to adress in future design.</li>
    <li> I purchased for Father&#x27;s Day for my boyfriend and I love it! I may be obsessed with it! I constantly make funny faces at myself in the shower. He loves it also of course.</li>
    <li> Works as described... squeegee is nice touch</li>
    <li> The mirror I received has the funhouse mirror effect on all four sides.  It&#x27;s also starting to leak a little.  I really tried to like it because 1. It really doesn&#x27;t fog up, 2. It feels secure, and 3. The squeegee is actually more useful than I thought it would be. I can only give it two stars because with the warping it doesn&#x27;t achieve the main function, being a flat mirror, well at all.</li>
    <li> Not bright enough. switch did not work properly</li>
    <li> The LED Fogless shower Mirror is PERFECT for anyone who needs to shave in the shower or tweeze.  It actually DID NOT FOG! I was very impressed.</li>
    <li> Love the mirror. I use it to shave in the shower, it does not fog at all.</li>
    <li> My his and wanted a fords mirror for Christmas this one fits the BL and he willo e and appreciate Kate it!  Thanks azon up you have everytimh I need</li>
    <li> Think it will work nicely.....but light is suppose to have 2 settings. Mine is either on or off. Not sure if it is the high or low setting? Probably not a big deal. Update....after less than 6 months the mirror fell from the tile and broke. Thought the extra effort to adhere this to the tile would work but it did not. Better off shaving without a mirror than paying this much for one that breaks.</li>
    <li> Great my dad loved it</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Be aware that is rather thick if you have narrow shower you may bump into it!</li>
    <li> This mirror works just as described!  Installation was easy and it stays on the wall!  Just fill it up with water as instructed and NO FOG!  No big deal to fill up and empty either. I love shaving in the shower but have always struggled with mirrors foggin up. Even the ones that claim no fog. No anymore. Wish I had found this product years ago. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband tried all kinds shower mirrors but none worked. This is really good product!  He loves it and it works beautifully and the most clear vision he&#x27;s ever had!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous  different shower mirrors and this one is the best by far. It is worth every penny and we are very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> My husband already had a mirror for the shower but when I saw this one I knew that I had to get it for him. The mirror is larger than most and it really is fogless. The quality is wonderful...My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a number of shower mirrors over the years. They&#x27;ve all been pretty horrible, overall. After reading the reviews on this particular mirror I decided to pull the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no been disappointed. It is fog free, I love that it has the light built in, and its large!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real downside I&#x27;ve seen so far is the way it mounts. For textured surfaces in the shower, this mounting does not seem to work very well. After 2 weeks it is already starting to come off. I am going to use some industrial strength silicone to see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is the price. $50 is crazy expensive for this thing. It&#x27;s all plastic, and I&#x27;d be willing to bet that manufacturing of this item isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have purchased numerous \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors in the past, paying anywhere from $15-$40, only to realize the  \\&quot;foglessness\\&quot; is only temporary in nature... and almost never longer than 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we&#x27;ve only had this one for a bit over a month, it appears to be the real deal.  Takes 20 seconds or less in the shower to fill the water cavity with fresh hot water.  Build quality is far superior to any other that we&#x27;ve purchased.  The light with two intensity settings is a really nice touch.  The squeegee is another neat feature but, it could be better sized to matched the mirror (minor gripe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, well worth the few extra bucks over its competitors.  In this case, it would seem that you really do get what you pay for.  Recommended buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  6/28/12 - Have used this mirror for just over 4 months.  Still loving the features above.  Still fogless.  Original batteries still have life left in them.  One additional minor gripe is that after the cavity on the unit is filled with water and rehung onto the base, the mirror has enough weight that it sometimes wants to tip downward... but it is easily readjustable to the preferred position, and holds firm as long as you don&#x27;t touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 months with other mirrors, I would be cussing them each and every morning as I squirm about the shower trying to find that one spot on the mirror that I can see enough of my face to properly shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  11/02/12 - The bracket no longer holds the weight of the mirror when filled with water, as the tilt mechanism has given out.  So now, I have to hold the mirror in one hand and shave with the other.... or else bend over to shave.  Either way, I am disappointed.  Update my review from 5 to 2 stars.  Thought I would get what I paid for... guess I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  5/24/13 - ToiletTree Products contacted me about the concerned that I was experiencing with the tilt mechanism on my mirror, and offered to replace it free of charge.  They have apparently changed the design or construction in some way to make the mechanism more durable.  I received the replacement tilt mechanism, and installed in about 1 minute... quick and easy! My mirror is like new again!  Thanks to the ToiletTree Products team for taking care of the customer.  I will definitely consider purchasing from these folks again in the future.eplace it free of charge.

    <li> i was looking for a new shower mirror because mine broke recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i decided to buy this not only because of the great reviews but because i always check out the bad reviews to see what the problems might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the few bad reviews seem like user error and almost every one has a comment from Steve offering to help or replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that is enough for me. love the great customer service Steve and am looking forward to my purchase.</li>
    <li> Works as promised, seems well made.  Easy to mount.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my husband for Christmas. It arrived in a timely manner.  He really enjoys it! It works well, and was easy to mount.  All of the features - the squeegee, the LED lights, and anti-fog function all work splendidly.</li>
    <li> I love shaving in the shower where I can wash my face in hot soapy water, then applying lather and, with the mirror very close, very clear, and with the lights on shave with my Gillette Power Fusion razor which buzzes and vibrates while I shave. To work well you need to take the mirror off the mount, pour out the cold water in the reservoir, fill it with hot water and remount the mirror.  It takes 15 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Warning. This is made of light and somewhat fragile plastic. Do not try to mount the rack to the wall with anything but silicone adhesive (supplied). I tried the tape and it fell off, cracked, the lights no longer worked, and now I&#x27;m on my second mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this may need to be light weight, but I wish they would make a metal and glass version of this product. I would pay more, and I think it would look better.&lt;br /&gt;One minor complaint: I don&#x27;t care for the ToiletTree logo and name on the top of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I looked long and hard on the internet for a better product and could not find it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is simply wonderful. But we bought it at the end of September and it just fell over the weekend. Is there a place where I can get more adhesive to hang it back up?</li>
    <li> water leaks out as you shave so mirror starts to fog up, eventually it clogs up and that stops after a couple months, like the light for shaving</li>
    <li> Every time I shave I say to my self I have to write a review but inevitably forget.  I would say that this product is the one you have been looking for. It installed easily (and comes off with a razor blade if you need to take it down).&lt;br /&gt;This mirror never fogs if you put hot water in it.  Some shower mirrors last a while and fog anyway, some fall off the wall in the middle of the night, some are too small.  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few shaving mirrors and this one hits all the marks, and the LED lighting is a great touch for that little bit of extra light you may not have in your shower. The shelf and squeegee is a nice touch as well. If I would add one thing (hint hint) it would be a good quality Bluetooth speaker.</li>
    <li> Works great! Just like it says, would buy again, thinking to get one for our rV</li>
    <li> This already has so many reviews I pretty much don&#x27;t need to say anything other than it really is amazing!  Works exactly like they say it does and is really easy to install.</li>
    <li> Superb, meet all expectations.</li>
    <li> First mirror I have bought that is TRULY fog-less in the shower.  I have had no problem with it falling off the wall in 2 years when the installation instructions were followed meticulously..  I have removed one star because a 2 level brightness control is rather ridiculous and only serves to eventually wear out the on-off brightness switch in half the time, having to cycle through the dim setting to shut it off.  When one is in the shower, who cares if you have a dim setting?  One wants to see as much as one can.</li>
    <li> This is the second I have purchased, because I moved and had to have it again in my shower. Best way to keep the mirror clean. No complaints with this whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This is my second ToiletTree mirror (I just replace my old one after I moved). Love it. Never fogs and does what it promises!</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror ever!! Period.</li>
    <li> Returned item due to poor quality materials used to manufacture. Lightweight and flimsy.</li>
    <li> works great is truly fog free when filled with warm water</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a week, but so far, this mirror is great. Where other \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors fail, this one succeeds. Hope it lasts!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product.  Works exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. Makes my morning shaves are bearable as possible. Had one slight issue with the tilt function. Emailed the seller. About an hour later the CEO of the company, Steve Parisi, wrote me back apologizing for the issue and sent me a replacement part the same day. I received it a day later. Steve, you are the man. I am about to purchase the travel size mirror and figured a review was called for.</li>
    <li> Works as promised.  Purchased to replace another mirror that never quit worked, it would always fog up.  Have used it for a few weeks now and works great.</li>
    <li> This Mirror is great. The way it is applied to your shower wall is easy and very secure. the method if preventing fogging is excellent, IT WORKS!!!! You can&#x27;t ask for better performance or quality of manufacture at this price.</li>
    <li> Last year I reviewed the Original ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror and loved it.  I didn&#x27;t really think they could improve upon it, but they have!  There are now LED lights around the frame that you turn on with a quick push of a button.It is also just a tad bigger than the original fogless shower mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ToiletTree LED Fogless mirror uses a silicone glue substance that you stick on your tile and then you attach the mirror, and it is holding it.  I have had it up now for awhile and it is not going anywhere!  I also don&#x27;t think I will have a problem removing the mirror if I want to as the silicone seems pretty flexible and is clear so it won&#x27;t leave a residue.  To use the mirror all you have to do is lift it off, fill it with hot water and snap it back on.  The hot water is the trick as that is what keeps it from fogging up!  Then if you do get spots on it or didn&#x27;t fill it with hot water, just use the attached squeegee to wipe it clean.  The shelf that is included also holds at least 2 razors so it is a nice size shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this ToiletTree makes the best fogless mirrors that I have seen so far and I really do recommend it.  So far it is working great for us and with features like an adjustable frame, LED lights, shatter proof, rust proof, easily attaches to tile, and a shelf, the mirror just keeps getting better!  Perfect for shaving facial hair or even tweezing a few strays!</li>
    <li> There is a HUGE difference between shaving 2 feet from your bathroom mirror over the sink and using this illuminated shower mirror...  This mirror is crystal clear and there&#x27;s no chance this things going to fog. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now; I&#x27;ve always shaved AFTER the shower.. I&#x27;ll never do it again! I am able to get a much closer shave,Its almost like my fiances makeup mirror.. but in the shower. Here&#x27;s a tip: If you shave mid-shower, you can shave against the grain and your skin wont get irritated due to all the moisture.   Easy Set up..  Great Quality Product!  I&#x27;m going to pick up a few more as Christmas Gifts..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror since January and it is fantastic. It stays fog-free for my whole shower and it&#x27;s large enough to get a good view of my entire face. I called the company with a small problem and they (the owner, actually) bent over backwards and sent out a replacement the same day. That&#x27;s what I call service!</li>
    <li> I bought this shower mirror for my husband and he loves it!  He uses it almost every morning and hasn&#x27;t had any problems with it so far!  We would totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Being an avid \\&quot;shower shaver\\&quot; I&#x27;ve tried quite a few fogless mirrors over the years, only to learn to live with the reality that I would have only a handful of shaves in the shower before the mirror (any) started fogging up, signaling that it was the end of enjoyable shaving experiences, until the next mirror!  But when I started to really search, and read reviews, I had to try this one.  The result:  Best shower mirror I ever had! Works exactly as adverised, and I am so done with mirrors that fog up after a month of use. Living in CA, we have very hard water, so as long as the mirror is kept dry after the shower using the supplied squeegee, all is perfect again!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it; the mirror area is good size and the lights make it a lot easier to see.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no fog and the lights work great. The mirror is a little small but that&#x27;s ok.  I had a minor problem with the mirror and the company had one of the fastest response times I&#x27;ve ever seen. Easily has some of the best customer service ever (thanks Kelly Parisi)!  I&#x27;ll update this review after I get to use the mirror some more, but I felt that I should tell people about the wonderful customer service.</li>
    <li> Purchased this mirror because I was tired of ones that either fogged constantly or fell off the wall. So far this mirror hasn&#x27;t done either and I&#x27;m very pleased. After purchasing it and using it for some time, I realized I had to move so I contacted the company (Toilettree) via email and received a response within 15 minutes saying they would send me a new mounting kit for FREE! A few days later it arrived along with a hand written note thanking me for my business and saying if I need anything else to please let them know. WOW! I haven&#x27;t had this type of service from any company before. Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!! Our old &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror wasn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; anymore.  We&#x27;ve had this up for over a month and really love how clear the mirror is! It&#x27;s based on temperature - not some spray or wipe.  It&#x27;s was easy to hang, it&#x27;s easy to fill up with water and empty, and it holds its angle perfectly!  We have a lot of shadows in our shower stall area and although the LED isn&#x27;t super bright, it works just fine for hubby to see his face and makes shaving a lot easier.  And he loves the little squeegee to get all of the water droplets off the mirror!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy with this purchase and would buy it again!!</li>
    <li> I have had a few shower mirrors and none can match this one.  It is truly everything you read and works amazingly well.  It has been over a month and has not fallen off the wall and continues to be fog free.  I highly recommend this item to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have owned a similar product by Toilettree for about a year now, so I was quick to buy this when I saw it coming out.  All of the great features the last one had a still there.  The mirror attaches permanently to my shower wall (no suction cups) and does not fog when I fill the reservoir with hot water.    They made a couple of big improvements that I think makes this worth the extra money.  First off the light is awesome.  No matter how long you have been shaving you need to be able to see what you are doing and this thing lights up the shower like I am playing in Yankee Stadium.  The size of the mirror is also larger with this model, which is nice as you have to put your neck into awkward angles less frequently.  I also think the little squeegee tool that they include for keeping it is a whole lot better.  The old model would steak a little and this one really gets the mirror clean.  Two years ago I had no idea these fogless products existed and now I can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this mirror. After a few weeks, the adhesive is holding up great. I thought taking off the mirror unit and refilling the water every time I took a shower might be a pain, but it&#x27;s actually very easy. The unit fits back on the \\&quot;harness\\&quot; without even really trying. I don&#x27;t know how I ever shaved without this thing!</li>
    <li> Will never hang on tile in shower longer than a month or so. Used their adhesive per directions, 3 weeks and fell off wall. Tried more high powered adhesive, same issue. Company is cool, very communicative, product just doesn&#x27;t hang.</li>
    <li> Not only a great product, but quick service from the company.   Plus, they follow up with information and reminders for  using the mirror. I am older and sit down to shower and  the fog-less mirror makes shaving and showering a treat.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best fog free mirror I&#x27;ve used.  It doesn&#x27;t just rely on some coating that will eventually wear off.  It uses simple science and works perfectly.  My only complaint is the lighting helps but isn&#x27;t great.  Obviously this isn&#x27;t a huge problem as long as there is adequate lighting and you just need a little bit more.  I would definitely recommend this mirror without hesitation and would buy one again as a gift or for myself if the occasion ever presented itself.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about three months now and it works great. For many years I had a mirror which was connected to the shower, kept fog free by the water running through it. I was worried that filling this mirror with water would be a hassle or inefffective.&lt;br /&gt; Well, it works great. The mirror nicely attached to the ceramic tile. You can fill it up with water, but I just take the handheld shower and run it over the mirror a few seconds.It stays fog free, and has a great reflection. The mirror does not seem to get clouded as my old one did.&lt;br /&gt; Very good reflection for shaving, all in all worth the price.</li>
    <li> Son in law uses in shower and likes this mirror I gave as gift.</li>
    <li> So, I have always gotten serious folliculitis on my neck from shaving. Discovered years ago that if I shave in the shower like every three days, I get very little of it (if I shave every day, even using a fresh high end razor and gel for sensitive skin, my neck turns into a wasteland of infected ingrown hairs). Using a shower mirror makes it possible. The problem? I have never had a light in my shower. This thing is very awesome. If you cut easy, get lots of ingrown hairs, or it hurts to shave, try it in the shower and get yourself a good shave mirror like this one!!! Isn&#x27;t cheap, but worth every penny so far.</li>
    <li> Product was everything it was advertised to be.  The gift recipient was very pleased.  And it arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I usually do not give reviews for products, but felt I needed to this time.  I have been using this mirror for a few months now, and the mirror works as advertised - does not fog up when you fill the reservoir with warm water.  I really enjoy being able to shave in the shower and not have to worry about the mirror fogging up.  However, after a few months of use the light stopped working.  I thought I needed to replace the batteries, but when I did the light still does not work.  Very disappointing. Luckily, there is enough light in the bathroom so this is not a major issue.  But I specifically bought this model because it does have a light, and would expect it to continue working longer than the few months I have had it.</li>
    <li> I have bought and used every fog less shower mirror available and none compare to this one. The extra step to fill it with hot water keeps it from fogging up While you&#x27;re showering.  Some reviews complained about the adhesive not sticking.  I followed the instructions and has been stuck on my shower for 6 months now. Only thing I would change on it would be a brighter light.  I  would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best fogless shower mirror I have ever owned. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this mirror! Bought it for  my husband for his birthday and he absolutely loves it! The light on it lights up the whole shower and it works just like promised, and doesn&#x27;t fog up at all. Am very happy I purchased it. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> WOW ! I have had many shower mirrors, but this one takes the cake. My morning routine includes pouring out the old water and replacing it with hot shower water. I run the rubber blade across it, turn on the light, and I&#x27;m good to go. Shaving has become an enjoyable experience because of this mirror. Cheers ! to the manufacturer because I am truly happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product is terrific. I used a smaller stick-on model from another company for several years, and, although I got used to simply wiping the fog off it with a washcloth every day, finding it on the shower floor after the suction cups started failing got old very fast. The wife bought me a \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; unit from another manufacturer that attaches to the shower head and routes the water through the mounting tube to the mirror. A nice idea, but water is heavy, and after one or two attempts I could never get the mirror to stay where I put it - it always slumped down with the weight of the water. In addition, the extra joints would always leak a little. A cheap and ultimately useless design. So when I came upon this item I was intrigued. The adhesive idea is much better than suction cups or add-on plumbing, and the adhesive is even removable should the user decide to take it down. The mirror is bigger and the light better than the other units I had. Despite that, it was MUCH less bulky than the articulated model that wouldn&#x27;t stay up. And there&#x27;s not all that much room in our smallish shower. Filling the container up takes a little getting used to, but it became second nature after a few days. And the little squeegee is also cool. You can use the mirror alone without filling it, by just squeegee-ing it once or twice. Other than not having a radio or a clock (also a requirement in my shower), which I subsequently accomplished with a small separate hanging radio, there&#x27;s nothing to dislike about this product. And very inexpensive to boot. Good job, ToiletTree!</li>
    <li> the mirror is not glass so you can&#x27;t see really well and the lights are a nice idea they just are not bright enough and you better plan out where you put it because once its attached it can not be removed easily.</li>
    <li> Awesome this thing is great. Just refill it and no fog the only bad thing is that there is no adjustable light intensity. Only the on and off switch, because of this, the batteries go fast. I am lucky if it lasts more than a 3 weeks. This is with 2 person use. Cannot speak for the other person using it but I have the light on for about 15-20 minutes. Other than that this is awesome.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for approximately two years, and prior to that, I had the non-LED version of the mirror (which had worked great!).  I followed the instructions and mounted the mirror in the shower.  The adhesive that came with it failed after a few months, so I remounted it with a stronger adhesive and have not had any issues with it falling down since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror works great except for one tragic flaw.  The pivoting mechanism is woefully under-engineered.  It fails immediately when filling the mirror with water.  It is now to the point, even when it is empty, the slightest touch or bump with cause the pivot mechanism to fail and cause the mirror to point downward.  At some point, I may try to modify the mirror myself to keep it locked in the perfect position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other suggestion I have would be to drill a tiny hole (very tiny) to allow the water to slowly drain out.  This would keep the water retained while showering, allowing the mirror to remain fog-free, but would empty it over the course of an hour or so, eliminating the need to empty it prior to filling with hot water again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, this mirror is a great concept, it just needs to be beefed up to function as intended without failure.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Amazon I was able to find the only TRUE fogless mirror. I bucked up and bought the larger more expensive mirror with the LED lights and glad I did. The only reason this didnt recieve 5 stars because $50 is a lot to pay for a small mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE KEY TO THIS PRODUCT IS ADDING THE WARM WATER IN THE MIRROR EACH TIME! I didnt realize this until about the 5th time trying it. Thankfully the company sent me an email to follow up on my purchase and included this little note in the email. I felt like an idiot since this is what truely makes it fogless and stays forgless for a long time. I have yet to take a shower long enough where the mirror actually fogged up. I imagine it would take about an hour if not more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great design, just a little pricey. I think $35 would be perfect for this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but I like the way it works. My only problem is that the silicone adhesive in the package was unusasble. I had to go buy my own. I hope it works to keep it from falling down, which has been my problem with other brands. I&#x27;ll update this after I use it for a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed and completely satisfied with this mirror so far. It truly does not fog up and the squeegee works well too.</li>
    <li> Great Product. I would like to suggest 2 simple changes to the manufacture. 1. Place a small pin hole on the bottom so the water will drip out very slowly. Will prevent you from dumping it after every use. 2. Put a timer on the led light. Will save batteries for the people like me that forget to turn it off. I would suggest this mirror to anyone I know though. Love it! I use it every day! Works like it should. I would upgrade my review to 5 starts if it had the upgrades I listed above. If you thinking about buying this product. Its worth every penny! Hope this review helps!!</li>
    <li> Less than 6 months until it fell off my wall.</li>
    <li> A definite must if you shave In shower?  Really does not fog and is super easy to install and use.</li>
    <li> This mirror is truly fogless.  Warm water in the well and there you go!! Nice size surface.  The original was good, the bigger deluxe size is better!  Anyone who needs to see their face in the shower for shaving or for any other reason, would be thrilled with this product. The installation device is superior to suction cups.  Will not fall off your shower wall.</li>
    <li> PRO: This shower mirror is OK - not \\&quot;just barely OK\\&quot; but a \\&quot;nice\\&quot; ok. It seems to be decently put together, and was easily installed (with clear instructions &amp; needed supplies). How it will hold up as a mirror remains to be seen, as I just recently received it. It certainly functions as advertised and, given the simple principles upon which it works, should continue to do so. Tried letting it fog up with no water in the container, then filled it with the requisite warm water and it defogged rapidly, within just several seconds. The included squeegee slips readily into the molded holder.  CONS: [1]The mirror is, frankly, dis-oriented by 90 degrees - it would be a whole lot more useful if the top to bottom dimension was the larger one - i.e., most people I know have faces that are longer than they are wide yet this mirror is oriented (and can&#x27;t be changed) with the larger dimension going side to side. [2]The re-mounting once filled with water is adequate but you&#x27;re doing it blindly since the mounting slot is on the back so it&#x27;s a bit awkward. [3]The two-levels LED lighting only works, out of the box, on one intensity and is overall kinda useless - if you shower &amp; shave in a pitch black room it&#x27;d likely be somewhat useful but in a regular shower with some ambient light it&#x27;s useless and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t pay the extra $20 for the light. [4] It&#x27;d also be better to have a hanging razor holder on the side of the attached bottom shelf, as it&#x27;s rather awkward to fit and retrieve a razor from the shelf as is, squeezing in between the mirror&#x27;s bottom edge and the squeegee holder; a molded holder at either end of the shelf would be better. [5]It&#x27;s nowhere near as nice as the several mirrors I&#x27;ve had with a magnifying option (but then again, they had the stupid plumbing connection that corrodes and made them dysfunctional).  All in all a decent mirror, worth the lower price ($30 without LED), that&#x27;ll do nicely until something better comes along. (And way better made than thetotally junk ShowerTek model whose plastic plumbing connection broke while first being installed.)</li>
    <li> I would have thought I didn&#x27;t like this, but I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids teased me thinking &amp;#34;oh... another thing from Amazon he&#x27;ll never use&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, really like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a shower on a hose, run warm water over it.. that will stop the fogging.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower mirror I have ever owned.  It was easy to install.  The adhesive tube it comes with worked great.  The mirror does not fog.  I like long showers and it stays fog free the entire time.  You can also adjust the angle of the mirror which is a nice feature.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband for his birthday after the one he had purchased from a well-known personal items store. The quality of the Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror was beyond our expectations! The Deluxe model is well worth the extra couple of bucks. It&#x27;s easy to fill and it does NOT fog up at all. I would highly recommend this product, and have plans to purchase one for my son as well.</li>
    <li> I bought one of the small mirrors last spring.  I liked it so much I bought 4 of the new larger ones,  3 as Christmas presents, and one for me.  I would recommend this mirror to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different \\&quot;fogless mirrors\\&quot; in my time. I&#x27;m the type that likes to shave in the shower and I have encountered every possible problem you can imagine. However, having said that, this product truly stands up to it&#x27;s name. If you know that the reason your mirror fogs in the first place, that it is due to a difference in temperature; it is easy to fix. Find a way to keep the mirror the same temp as the shower. A water bath seems to be a good choice. The ToiletTree fogless mirror does that and doesn&#x27;t fall. Great product !!!!</li>
    <li> Works well enough except I find that the mirror becomes blurred with what I think is soap residue very quickly. I owned the unlit version and never had that problem. I would not buy the lighted version again. Stick with the unlit.</li>
    <li> BACKGROUND - My original order arrived in perfect condition.  However, more than 1/2 of the mounting silicone was solidified in the tube.  I followed the mounting instructions as well as I could, but it fell down after I had mounted it with the sticky pads and what I could get out of the tube.  I really wanted to use the product because I knew it would work and that it was exactly what I wanted.  However, at the time, they did not include a customer support phone number so I could request a replacement mounting kit.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning the product and wrote a 4 star review - noting simply that their supplier sent some faulty silicone tubes and suggesting that they should include a customer service phone number so they could send me a $0.50 mounting kit, rather than having to return a $50 mirror.  Within 2 hours of writing my review, on a Saturday morning, I received a note from the company&#x27;s president noting that they had just started inserting a customer service phone number in their new packaging.&lt;br /&gt;REVISED REVIEW - Since I received my new mirror, I have had no problems.  It is easy to hang and I really like the clarity of the mirror while showering.  It provides an excellent shower shaving experience.  You need to fill up a small reservoir behind the mirror with water from the shower (which is what keeps it from fogging) but it is easy to fill, re-hang and dump after your shower.  This is the first no-fog mirror I have used that I can recommend 100% and think it is a great addition to my shower.  I also have to complement ToiletTree for their quick response to my issue.  I am impressed how well they responded to my concern as well as how well they stand by their products.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great! I use it for shaving in the shower throughout the week. It just fell off the wall after 6 months of use. I am receiving a free replacement mounting kit from the company. Now that&#x27;s customer service for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- best shower mirror on the market&lt;br /&gt;- the light is a nice touch for darker bathrooms and for close-up tweezing&lt;br /&gt;- great customer service. will send replacement mounting kit if yours falls off like mine did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- mounting system could possibly be improved (fell off the shower wall after 6 months of use)&lt;br /&gt;- 2 light settings are not needed. i never use the low setting. the light could be brighter.&lt;br /&gt;- spots on the mirror if you don&#x27;t wipe the water off every time. hard to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;- remounting the mirror once off the wall mount is not always seamless&lt;br /&gt;- would be nice to have a razor hanger rather than a shelf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop looking if you want a shower mirror and buy this one! ...or the less wide model without the light.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very happy about this product, the mount is very flimsy, after one month of use it will not hold the weight of the warming water tank, the mirror will change position and will not stay in place under the weight. I do not know if this is just the one I got but looking at the design of the mount, I must say it is not design very well. I would not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on the review 02/10/2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for a year I still keep my previous opinion.  The mount is poorly design and now it simply broke and it is not working. It cannot hold the weight of the water in the tank. After the first review the company sends me a new piece of the plastic holder mount. That did not help.  I am using the shaving cream canister position under the mirror to keep the mirror in place.  I don&#x27;t feel like going through a dispute about returning the product with the value of $ 50.00 so, it is going to go off my shower wall and will end up in recycle container. Maybe I just got a \\&quot;lemon\\&quot; or maybe it is what it is for $ 50.00 I hate to throw money away and I really like to shave in shower so the disappointment is a double.&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommend this product to anyone unless the factory will prove to me that this was just a single problem and will contact me with UPS return label and a new mirror(a better one) on the way.&lt;br /&gt;If so I will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> My hubby likes to have a clean-shaven face, life is much more convenient for both of us when he can use a mirror in the shower. For him, it is much better to be able to shower and shave at the same time, making his morning routine go by much faster. For me, I love the fact of not having to clean any hair out of the sink. It&#x27;s a win win for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing we noticed when we received the ToiletTree LED Fog-less Shower Mirror was the new feature, the lights. Immediately, we knew this would help hubby even more. The shower is in the corner of the bathroom and it is a stand alone shower so it is pretty dim in there. Shaving can be a little risky, since you don&#x27;t have much light. The mirror does not use suction cups which is a plus, meaning no sliding down, or simply falling off the wall altogether. The mirror requires adhesive which, for our old mirror, lasted well over 6 months and was still going strong. Although, you do have to allow the mirror to stand a full 24 hrs before using, which includes putting the mirror on it. The mirror is super easy to mount and fill with water. With my hubby and I being a foot different in height, it is really nice that the mirror has a tilt action. The shelf is perfect for hubby to set his razor on, plus I love the included squeegee which slides onto the shelf for easy storage. Also the LED has two different light settings, bright &amp; dim, depending on what you need. My hubby couldn&#x27;t be more content with his new mirror with LED Lighting.</li>
    <li> I was really tired of replacing the cheap shower mirrors you find elsewhere every few months, so I gave this mirror a try.  At first, the size was a little intimidating, but after mounting it (according to the manufacturer instructions) and using it a few times, I was sold.  The LED lights could be a little brighter, but overall I was very pleased.  The included squeegee worked great to eliminate the water marks on the mirror surface.  After 5 months, the unit was still in great shape.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it was at that time, it came crashing down.  The adhesive and mounting strips are still on the wall, so it is a problem with adherence to the unit itself.  There are many complaints about this same type of problem with this unit, so hopefully the manufacturer can address this issue.&lt;br /&gt;I really did like this product while it lasted.</li>
    <li> My morning shaving chore is now a pleasure thanks to this fogless, lighted mirror! Easy to mount, easy to use. I have a dimly-lit shower so the LED light is a must.</li>
    <li> I purchased the original fogless shower mirror and loved it. I recently purchased the deluxe model. This mirror is awesome . I was able to use the existing mounting system from the original mirror. The light makes a incredible difference. If you shave in the shower this is a must. It only takes a couple of seconds to fill with warm shower water and its stays fog free for the entire shower. I love this mirror.</li>
    <li> This is the third shower mirror my fiance has had in the last four years (and the second one that I have replaced for him).  The other two had a marked tendency to lose their grip on the shower wall and crash to the floor which, besides making a startling noise (What the heck was THAT!), was rather detrimental to the razor as well as the mirror.  So this mirror seems firmly attached to the tile!  I love the little squeegee that comes with it, too.  And keeping it fog-free is guaranteed since the trick is the warmer water in the reservoir.  That means no special coating to wear off or gradually lose effectiveness.  A great product!</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror - worked great the few times I used it until one of the plastic parts broke - the part which the mirror slides down onto and which clicks onto the wall piece and allows it to swivel up and down. Because some reviewers had a problem getting the wall mounting piece to stay attached to the wall, I carefully followed the directions and tips and got the mounting bracket firmly attached to the wall. Unfortunately, the plastic piece onto which the back of the mirror slides down on and allows it to &amp;#34;ratchet&amp;#34; up and down and click into a useable angle got a small crack after just a few uses and now the mirror can&#x27;t click into and stay in a useable viewing angle. I realize this can happen with small plastic parts but I&#x27;m really disappointed that I can&#x27;t use the mirror unless I can get a replacement part or remove and remount it higher up so It doesn&#x27;t have to be angled up to be useable. (Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have done such a good job attaching the bracket to the wall).  And to make the situation worse, I thought I might quickly fix the cracked piece with one of my many plastic glues - if only I could find where I left my box of glues. Finally found the glue - now all I have to do is find the cracked plastic piece!  Seriously, over the course of several days looking for the  box of glues,  I must have put the cracked part in a &amp;#34;safe place&amp;#34; which I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for but can not find.  I&#x27;ve now spent way too much time looking for a not so little plastic part (and repeatedly asking my wife if she is sure she hasn&#x27;t seen or moved it). I&#x27;m about ready to buy another one of these $50 mirrors. I&#x27;ve looked at many other &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; options, but I still like this Toilettree mirror the best. While other brands also use use a warm water reservoir to keep the mirror fog free, I like the size of this mirror, the included squeegee with built-in holder, and that it has led lights that go all the way around it that stay on until i turn them off - not just two or three lights that time out in the middle of my shave.  And I especially like doing business with a company whose president personally responds to every complaint - even those from customers who have clearly not taken the time to read the instructions. I&#x27;m sure they would replace my cracked part - if I could only find where my wife put it..)</li>
    <li> We thought this mirror was going to be great...and it was while it lasted.  My husband installed as directed (with the silicone) and over the weekend it fell off of the wall and broke :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different kinds of fogless shower mirrors, but this one is by far the best and worth the premium price. The mirror mounted well on slightly textured tile, which I was concerned about; it stays fog-free as long as you follow the instructions and fill it with warm water before each use; and it&#x27;s big and clear without distortion so I can see all of my pretty face and head. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t actually shave me; I still have to do all the work.</li>
    <li> Absolutely  wonderful .......perfect design!</li>
    <li> When I opened this I thought \\&quot;Man, my 5.00 shower mirror at least has a metal frame.\\&quot; This is plastic from top to bottom.&lt;br /&gt;I installed it according to the directions. When I went to install the batteries the battery house door would not open no matter how I turned the screws. So, I didn&#x27;t bother. I would never need the light anyway. As I filled up the reservoir with water I thought \\&quot;Every day?\\&quot; And then when putting it back on the incredibly badly designed bracket I thought \\&quot;No way.\\&quot; And then just as I finished shaving using this thing it began to slip off of the wall. I laughed. Really hard. Back to Amazon. This obviously works well for alot of folks. But I&#x27;ll stick with my old mirror.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for 2 weeks, but so far, so good! My only concern was if the mirror would stay on the wall. It&#x27;s still there, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going anywhere! Fill the reservoir with hot water, and voila....NO FOG!&lt;br /&gt;A very clever idea!&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to ToiletTree!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my boyfriend as a gift.  It was very easy to mount to my tile wall, which I was concerned about. The double-sided stickers were already secured to the back of the mirror. I just had to pull the tape off and stick to the tile surrounds. Easy peasy! They also supply you with silicone adhesive if you the stickers aren&#x27;t strong enough.  My boyfriend LOVES this product, his reaction: &amp;#34;Having that mirror in the shower was like having a religious experience!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Have tried other shower mirrors in the past, but was always disappointed with fog-less ability, lighting and quality.  This item does everything it promises.  It stays fog-less for the entire shower.  It is big and bright.  It is also attractive and not cheap or junky looking.  The big question is how well the reflective surface will hold up over time, as others eventually became spotted, hazy and less clear due to hard water.  Loving it so far and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought it in November and it was working fine. 3 months later it is laying in pieces in the bottom of my shower. The adhesive is still on my tile, but the mirror came loose.</li>
    <li> Got this for the hubby for Xmas and he loves it! It&#x27;s pricey but I think the quality makes it worth it. Very easy to use. It is foggless because you fill it with warm water before getting in the shower. I was worried about this being complicated but it is actually pretty easy to use. Buying another for my brother!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as promised, easy install &amp; works wonderfully. Would strongly suggest for anyone that enjoys to shave in the shower....</li>
    <li> adhesive came undone and the plastic that holds the mirror in place broke....Basically useless now After only a few months of use.</li>
    <li> Some reviews indicate this mirror is distorted and hard to attach to the bracket. I found both of these claims to not be true. There are smaller more expensive similar options but this one works exactly as advertised. The overall rating from many buyers tells the story. Filling the mirror is very simple and easy to do, and it works great. It also comes with everything you need to install, for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> The mirror is not fog less. It fogs immediately despite filling it up with hot water. It does not allow magnification either which is very important. I am changing it.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband. He loves this mirror. Nice size. Good bracket system and great fogless feature.</li>
    <li> Update 3&lt;br /&gt;The company sent the replacement after my 2nd update and it has worked brilliantly.  After a rough start, we&#x27;re now happy customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and no sign of the promised replacement mirror.  I&#x27;m giving up hope that the company will resolve the problem as promised.  We&#x27;re back to 1 star for poor follow-up and failure to resolve a problem with mirror quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Update&lt;br /&gt;Within minutes of posting the review below, I received a comment from the company.  They are standing behind the product and sending a replacement unit.  I am very pleased with their customer service and quick response.  Had the customer service email been provided with the mirror I would have contacted them directly instead of commenting here....never like to reduce a good company&#x27;s average....so score is moving up from a 1 to a 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review&lt;br /&gt;We remodeled our MB and spent extra on a nice fog less mirror.  We installed according to instructions and let sit the required 24 hours before attaching the mirror to the brace.  Within 10 minutes the unit fell to the tile floor and the cheap plastic brace broke in the area where the mirror attaches.  It is now useless. I purchased this well before the remodel was completed and didn&#x27;t install until just two days ago.  Too late for a return.</li>
    <li> Simple design easy to use.  After years of trying different shower mirrors this is the first one I have found that is indeed fog free</li>
    <li> I do like this mirror, but the LED did nothing for me so wish I had just bought the cheaper one and saved the $20. The fog free design works great, and it is of good quality, it&#x27;s just that the LED light doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;add&amp;#34; to the ambient light at all (maybe just bc different color/light spectrum?) and it&#x27;s not bright enough to light up your face by itself unless you are really close.</li>
    <li> I have bought a few cheaper shower mirrors and finally decided to spend a bit more on this one. I have used the mirror for a few weeks now and it works great. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Good product and works as advertised. Quick delivery but be aware that the manual may state the LED lights are settable for high or low but really has an on-off state which is fine. Each time before shaving, the product has to be removed from the wall mount and water added. Simple step and easy to perform. I found that after each shave I need to empty the reservoir because otherwise I could hear a slight drip, drip, drip at night. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The mirror is amazingly beneficial to my shower/shave experience each day. I&#x27;m bald, so shaving my head is especially a concern. The old, cheap mirror I used was awful. This new one is large and stays fog-free, and works as advertised. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> The best shower mirror I have ever seen! Great product! Husband is very pleased! Good quality. I&#x27;m sure it will last for years. Worth every penny!The lighting is excellent!</li>
    <li> The mirror and mounting are well designed, however, the light is little more than a glow. The product came promptly and I am satisfied, thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought the shaving mirror for my husband two months ago. It was really easy to install, using silicone glue and double-sided tape. This is a good option for people who have stone in their bathroom. We have a slate bathroom shower stall and it installed very easily. Once you add the hot water it truly is fog free. The only downside is you have to fill it up with hot water every time you use it.</li>
    <li> Nice looking product, practical and the warm water idea to stop the mirror fogging up is effective, however my mirror did fall off the shower wall after a couple of months, think that was due to the mirror being taken on and off its cradle every day, movement etc. A better design would have been to put a small hole at the base of the mirror with a rubber stop so it can be drained after use without the need to take it off the cradle. You&#x27;d also need to use a small cup or similar to fill it under this scenario. If your taking the mirror off its cradle every day then I don&#x27;t think the supplied double sided sticky foam and silicon adhesive are sufficient.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of a blog giveaway and I gave it to my husband.  He installed it with the included silicone in seconds, and it&#x27;s so much more durable than the suction cups which never seem to work very long.  Although as a woman I don&#x27;t have much cause to use it (I suppose I do turn it on to floss with and to apply facial masks) my husband really loves it.  He said (quote) \\&quot;it makes shaving fun again.\\&quot;  He like how the swivel and the extra light make detailed shave swipes easier.  You fill the back reservoir up with the hot shower water in just a few seconds.  You can squeegee the water droplets off the mirror with the included squeegee which is nicely built into the shelf--just slide out and back in.  It came with batteries which is always a plus.  The LED light is a simple side push on-off button operated and is nicely bright.  The shower isn&#x27;t the best lit place in the bathroom with the curtain pulled, so it comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend remembering to dump the water out when you&#x27;re done in the shower, otherwise, the next time you go to use it you end up dumping cold water on you whilst in a nice hot shower, which could be a bit unexpectedly frigid in winter house temperatures!</li>
    <li> its true to what they say does stay pretty fogless as long as you keep warm water in the back. but you must make sure you have the right material for it to stick to with the adhesive it doesn&#x27;t work with all material.</li>
    <li> Think about it for a second.  You&#x27;re late for an important date and you need to get cleaned up and out of town.  Who do you know, man or woman, who wants to fill the mirror up with hot water?  Who would ever think of such a thing?  And don&#x27;t forget to drain the water out after you get done!  This thing is a joke!  Do yourself a favor and find one for 5 or 10 bucks and save some money.</li>
    <li> Clumsy, mounting side too big, difficult to use, you have to remove the mirror to add water to keep it fog less- not an easy feat. Overall takes up way too much space in shower. Very disappointed with this purchase. Do not understand the positive reviews at all.</li>
    <li> This  mirror is exactly what was advertised.  Stuck to our marble wall...no sliding off.  Perfect size and the light is an added bonus.  Only suggestion would be for the mirror to be  magnfied...maybe 5x to 10x for us seniors who need it.  Other than that, great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used a couple other shower mirrors in the past and have been rather disappointed in either their ability to stay clear, or else they fell after just a couple months of use. I&#x27;ve had this up for about a month now and it works exactly how they claim. It uses a pair of adhesive pads, as well as silicon paste that comes with it. I don&#x27;t know how well it comes off, but it has held quite well so far. As far as the mirror itself, you do need to fill it with hot water every use, which takes all of 5 seconds. After a quick wipe with the included squeegee it&#x27;s good to go. The squeegee is very compact and slides into the bottom of the mirror&#x27;s base, so it&#x27;s never out of reach when you need it. The base beneath the mirror is perfect for holding my razor. If you have multiple people using this, the mirror tilts quite easily and holds in place even when filled with water. I have personally gotten into the habit of leaving it filled with the old water until my next shower, then dumping it and filling it with no problems. Though I have not needed to use them yet, the lights around the edges are the perfect brightness to not blind you while using them at close range. Overall, this is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to streamline their morning routine and simply shave in the shower. Keep up the great work guys</li>
    <li> The light stopped working on week 2 of having it. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good shower mirror.</li>
    <li> The fog free works great! By pouring warm water in the reservoir behind the mirror, the mirror heats up and doesn&#x27;t fog. The LEDs are another story. For me, in a relatively dark shower, the LEDs illuminate my face only when I get about 2 inches or less from the mirror. Any farther back, and they simply glare in my eyes, causing my pupils to contract, making my reflection appear darker! Also, the light is a very cold, harsh white. The only way a person would get a reflection as shown in the illustrating photo is to be in an already brightly lit room, thus negating the need for the LEDs.</li>
    <li> As advertised just not as bright as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> This is a really nice mirror. Shatter proof and well made. The two levels of lighting are really nice and can make a huge difference in a dimly lit shower area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes off the frame easily too and you can tilt it for people of different heights.</li>
    <li> As advertised does not fog up ,works really well best shaving mirror for the shower I have ever had I would highly recommend it to anybody</li>
    <li> This mirror is truly fogless, when directions are followed. I have had it 2 weeks and it works fine every day.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the lights, as my shower has adequate lighting, but have installed the batteries, if finer detailing is needed. The squeegee works fine and has easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;Room for more than one razor on the shelf would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works as advertised and I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> When I first attempted to install this mirror it didn&#x27;t go so great. The silicon that was provided said to apply it and let it settle for 24 hours. After the first 24 hours passed, I put on the mirror and it ended up falling in my tub within minutes. After a quick trip to the hardware store for another tube of silicon, I let it cure for 48 hours (as recommended on the tube) and it is now on pretty much semi-permanently.  The picture is sort of deceiving because the space between the mirror and the small shelf that holds your razor is actually closer together unless you angle the mirror in a high incline. The mirror is a proper size and I was actually thinking of getting the smaller size without the LEDs but I probably would&#x27;ve returned that one because I couldn&#x27;t imagine using a smaller mirror than this one. Overall this is a pretty solid product.</li>
    <li> Really like this mirror. However I gave it 4 stars since the lights don&#x27;t really illuminate all that well. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t fog up is such a bonus. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great idea. I think the first mirror in this series was probably the best. The addition of lights is pretty useless. Having lights shine directly into your eyes constrics your pupils reducing your vision. The oposite effect they were going for, and the batteries just add to the weight. I love the engineering as far as using hot water behind the mirror. I would like to see the larger size without lights. Or perhaps a seperate light that mounts high above shining down on your face not directly into your eyes. Overall good product. Price could be a little cheaper, doesn&#x27;t look expensive to construct.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised, Did not fog in the shower &amp; the mirror stayed clear.</li>
    <li> Works perfect. Tried other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors with disappointment before but this one really works!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror after owning several fogless mirrors over the years.  In the past I had mirrors that used suction cups which always result in the mirror always falling and eventually cracking or losing it&#x27;s effectiveness (difficult to see no matter what).  I liked the idea that this mirror was larger and included lighting.  When it arrived the lighting didn&#x27;t work all of the time.  I would need to tap the side for the lights to come on (sometimes they would, sometimes not).  I wrote to the company and within a couple of hours I got an email from the company&#x27;s president informing me that they would ship me out a new one.  It arrived in a few days, along with a nice note from Kelly (Director of Marketing).  Put in the batteries and the new one works like a charm! For those that like the idea of having a shower mirror for shaving I never owned one that has been as nice.  I know it&#x27;s only a shower mirror, but I was very pleased with the response from the company which is often rare to receive such a quick positive response and wanted others to be aware of their service.</li>
    <li> My husband shaves his head every other day and his face every 2-3 days. He&#x27;d comment about the inconvenience and less than ideal arrangement of shaving over the bathroom sink. I researched various fogless mirrors and this seemed to be the ideal.  My research and selection paid off. My husband raves about this product.  It was easy to install, stable when installed, has great lighting, a tilt feature that enables me to use it (my husband is over 6 feet and I&#x27;m just above 5 :)  , and we don&#x27;t have to use any sprays for the fogless mirror. This product was definitely worth my money and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shower mirror for my husband this past Christmas. I have purchased several different types of fogless mirrors over the years,however, none worked very well. The reviews on this site about the mirror were very helpful. So far, my husband really likes the product and has not complained at all. He is very pleased!</li>
    <li> mirror fell off after a few weeks</li>
    <li> I received this mirror as a Christmas Gift. (December 2012)&lt;br /&gt;It has been great. Just recently, the pivoting device began to slip occasionally. It seems as if the gears are stripped. Is there any way that I can purchase a new base that has just the holder?&lt;br /&gt;If not, then I will just buy a new mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Please advise me as to what I should do next.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror. Very easy to install and sturdy. Does not slip or fall. Once you fill it with warm/hot water the mirror stays completely fog free. Light helps too. Perfect for shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have tried 5 different(cheap shower mirrors)...none of them did what they claimed.I ordered one of these and installed it(easy)....and to my surprise and delight it did exactly what they said.I ordered a second one a week later.Dont look any further....buy one of these</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products out there.  Replaces the terrible flogless versions of the past.  Is a great gift for men.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shower mirror in a long time (I&#x27;ve probably used 7-8 so far). It looks fantastic, actually increases the aesthetics of your bathroom. Extremely easy to use and no sprays or any other type of regular maintenance required.  And superb customer service. I sent in an email to the seller via Amazon asking for another installation kit as I needed to move the mirror to a different location, and they sent it out to me same day at no cost. While it wouldnt have costed much to go to Home Depot and get the adhesive myself, just the fact that for something that doesnt cost more than 50 bucks, you dont expect this level of prompt and courteous customer service.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I would highly recommend. I received this in a giveaway but it would have been worth buying.</li>
    <li> Improvements over earlier model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also own the earlier version of this mirror without the LED lighting.  Both versions work great, however; the lighting around my shower is very dim, so the LED lighting was a welcome addition.  This version of the mirror is also larger than the previous version, but is installed on the same wall mount, so need to remove the old mount if you are upgrading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great features applicable to both models:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the fact that the mechanism used by this mirror truly makes it fogless, it has other great features as well.  I have tiled walls in my shower, which means I can&#x27;t use devices with suction cups.  However, this mount relies on silicone adhesive, which works great.  In addition, the squeegee that is included with this model seems to work better than the squeegee included with the prior model (which also worked reasonably well).  Finally, the razor shelf is a nice touch to round out the functionality of this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor suggested improvement:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only minor improvement I would suggest to the manufacturer is that it would be great if there was an option to magnify the glass by 10-20%.  Not sure how feasible this would be to accomplish with a square mirror.  In any event, this is very minor compared to everything else this mirror has to offer.</li>
    <li> This product has received a lot of great reviews, and it deserves all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week. It was easy to install, seems very secure on the wall, and is perfect for shaving. It stays fogless; the light does what it&#x27;s supposed to; and the squeegee leaves me with a clean mirror (no trying to see myself through water spots or drops).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read the comments about the bad silicone that shipped with some mirrors. I picked some up at a local home supply store before the mirror arrived, just in case, but I didn&#x27;t need it. The silicone that arrived in the box worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT OCTOBER 18, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lights at the bottom of the mirror started flickering a couple of weeks ago, and stopped coming on with the lower setting altogether. I changed the batteries, and the problem remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed ToiletTree&#x27;s customer service and had a replacement mirror on my doorstep in less than a week. No hassle, just great customer service.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  Works perfectly.  Great size and convenient features such as light and razor holder.  If you are looking for a great sized mirror for shaving in the shower this is it.  And to top it all off AWESOME customer service.  These guys standbehind their products.  I have had mine for more than three years and it is still working like a champ.</li>
    <li> I have had 3 different Zadro Z&#x27;fogless mirrors and was never satisfied but thought there wasn&#x27;t anything else so I would deal with it.  This time I found this Fogless Shower mirror by ToiletTree Products and I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed.  I had hoped that I could use suction cups but instead used some 3M double sided sticky tape that I already had and use for different applications.  It was secured much more quickly than their conventional method and so far I am very impressed.  The product is well made and is truly fogless.  If it had a zoom it would be even better but I have to say it was worth every penny.  [[ASIN:B005OSQGN8 Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.]]  I am very pleased and would purchase again if I evey move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The only issue I&#x27;ve had is the mirror holder has keeping the mirror up if I adjust it that way.  It&#x27;s not a huge problem but I have to hold the mirror up with one hand in order to see what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
    <li> The best thing about the mirror is the LED lights and the adhesive mounting idea. Don&#x27;t bother with the smaller version of this mirror because this one is almost too small. A good idea for who buys this is to drill a few holes in the bottom of the plastic shelf to accommodate your razors meaning holding more than one. The fog less part works as stated.</li>
    <li> This is my second fogless mirror from Toilet Tree  products and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I have noticed a lot of negative comments about fogless mirrors over the years.  I honestly think the reviewers weren&#x27;t paying attention to the product description they bought the product.  You put warm water into it,  squeegee it .then pour the water out. I love it</li>
    <li> This is just a wonderful fogless mirror.  It is the first one I&#x27;ve ever had that actually works.  I can shave with a crystal clear reflection.  I have 2 homes and liked the first one so much, I couldnt live without it at my other residence.</li>
    <li> Love it! Just what my husband wanted. Durable and convenient.</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE Of the few gadgets that I  have purchased that really works. The mirror is crystal clear and it looks very good. I highly recommend this  mirror. The adhesive that  comes with the mirror is excellent. There is no doubt that the mirror will stay on the wall.</li>
    <li> Despite my initial fear...it&#x27;s not as much of a pain loading it up with water as I thought it would be.  The benefit of being able to spend longer in the hot shower since I can shave more diligently (no need to hurry to beat the fog) outweighs the 20 seconds it takes to load it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2012-11-21: Had to update my review. ToiletTree&#x27;s customer service is unbelievable! Among the top I&#x27;ve encountered.  I called a few days ago due to experiencing the \\&quot;drooping mirror\\&quot; from the previous design and, without missing a beat, the nice gal I talked to (she sounded like she was in the states and calling from next door) said they&#x27;ve since redesigned that piece and would send out the updated part, free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to this morning (a few days later). Since my mirror is going to be useful again, I thought I&#x27;d change out the batteries since they were near death (LED lights were very  dim).  After my shower, I took the mirror over to my sink and, using a quarter, turned the two sealing screws to their respective \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; pictures. The top of the battery compartment opened just fine but the bottom, despite the sealing screw indicating it was unlocked, would not budge. I peaked inside of the top to see how the locking mechanism worked and was very confident all was in order and it was likely just a little stuck due to not having been opened for awhile.  Sliding the screw along the seam between the door and battery compartment, I applied a little pressure to get it unstuck.  To my surprise, the door finally popped open but when I turned the door over, I could see that the locking mechanism was still locked to the plastic piece it recessed into...and that piece had broken away from inside the battery compartment housing! :(  Upon further investigation, I could see that the plastic piece that was supposed to turn to lock the door, was indeed stuck and the metal screw that attached it to the outside sealing screw just spun when the sealing screw turned -- I was never getting that door off.  Even after tightening the metal screw, I couldn&#x27;t get the two separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now, I had a part on the way to make my mirror useful again, but a broken battery door that rendered the LED system useless due to now being unsealable. How&#x27;s that for irony? :)  This morning, I was actually very confident that ToiletTree customer service would make things right, just from the painless interaction I had with them concerning the pivoting bracket a few days ago....and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. After explaining my situation to the gal on the phone (including the part that is on its way), she asked if replacing the battery compartment door would fix the issue.  I indicated that, unfortunately, it would not, since the piece the bottom locking mechanism was supposed to lock to came detached from the inside battery compartment housing. I offered to send her a few pictures since (as you can see from above), it&#x27;s not the easiest thing to convey over the phone. She said, \\&quot;Oh no, no, that won&#x27;t be necessary.  What we&#x27;ll do is send you out a new mirror. I&#x27;ll expedite the shipment so you get it as soon as possible.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now THAT&#x27;s what I call customer service and a company that stands behind their product.  I have no doubt in my mind that if the screw failure is not an isolated incident, that, just like with the pivot bracket, ToiletTree will make things right.  Despite having the two issues I have, I have no reservations about recommending this product as well as the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2012-11-26: The replacement arrived.  I opened the box and all had arrived as promised.  *sigh* But I&#x27;m experiencing the exact same issue as before.  Turning the bottom screw to unlock does indeed unlock that lock on the battery compartment door but turning the top screw (felt rather tight) to unlock does not unlock the bottom screw lock. Having been through this once and eventually getting the door off, I know that any pressure I use to successfully dislodge the door will result in another broken unit. *sigh*  One more call to customer service tomorrow.  Such a great idea.  I haven&#x27;t seen any other complaints when searching \\&quot;screw\\&quot; through the reviews and if it weren&#x27;t such an easy action to take (i.e. turn screw to unlock symbol), I&#x27;d think there was something I was doing wrong.  Will update after customer service call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2012-11-27: Talked to Kelly at customer service. She indicated that the screw issue was not normal let alone getting another unit and having it occur right out of the box. To ToiltTree&#x27;s credit, she&#x27;s sending another unit out and test the door herself before sending. She is also sending prepaid postage to have me send the other two units back so they can take a look.  Here&#x27;s hoping that this is just a freak occurrence. With an idiot-proof design of \\&quot;turn the arrow to the unlock symbol\\&quot;, I&#x27;m hoping that this is the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to be impressed with how ToiletTree customer service handles themselves, how the company backs their product, and how they value a customer&#x27;s time and inconvenience.  A++.  I will update after new unit arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2012-11-30: The new unit arrived. Little did I know, I&#x27;d open it to find a very nice, hand-written letter mentioning the postage-paid return sticker as well as a few sentences directing me to the fogless travel mirror they included to make up for the problems I&#x27;ve had so far.  The unit seems like one I would expect to receive.  The door screws are not overly tight (the issue I believe the other two suffered from but don&#x27;t seem loose enough to cause seal issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly update this review again if I have any issues but I don&#x27;t really expect to.  ToiletTree has a great product and they have an equally great customer service to back it up.  I don&#x27;t recall ever receiving this level of care from any other company...and there ARE a handful of good ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The door was already taken off, as Kelly had indicated she would do as a matter of testing it. I placed the batteries in the compartment, screwed the door back on and put the mirror on the mount in the shower and am back to using the best fogless mirror around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Kelly and thank you for making it right ToiletTree!  I would most certainly buy this product as a gift for any of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - ToiletTree&#x27;s customer service is a class act, though the 2nd product still has an issue.y pressure I use to successfully dislodge the door will result in another broken unit. *sigh*  One more call to customer service tomorrow.

    <li> Worked well, until the &amp;#34;designed not to fall&amp;#34; product fell. The &amp;#34;shatter proof high quality acrylic&amp;#34; mirror did not break as advertised! Just the surrounding plastic frame/reservoir shattered :( I still used for awhile after the unfortunate silicone adhesive failure, however the unit leaked like a sieve and would no longer hold the warm water to keep it fog-less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on examining the adhesive left on the wall, I had plenty of surface area showing a good bond was made. All of the adhesive was on the tile side, none remained on the back of the mirror. I also had used the included double sided sticky pads, and the silicone was clear of the pads to make sure it was also directly mounted between tile and mirror. I really don&#x27;t think I could have done a better job on the adhesive instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend slightly sanding or &amp;#34;roughing up&amp;#34; the back of the mirror prior to adhering it to the shower wall in order to give a little &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; for the silicone, something to give it something to stick to versus the smooth glossy finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to sum up, the mirror was really good for the 4 months I was able to use it, however, I have to rate lower since I feel that the included adhesive and/or design needs to be improved.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband  as he has wanted one for a long time.  When he went to put it up the light did not work.  We replaced the batteries and it still did not work.  We returned it and did not reorder. He thought the water filling procedure was a bit cumbersome.  We were wondering why the company did not put a small release valve on the bottom corner of the reservoir so it (the reservoir) could be drained without removing it from the unit. Had the light worked we would have kept it and used it. Amazon is amazing with their returns.  I did the entire thing on line--No waiting on the phone.  My account was credited less then 3 weeks after the return.</li>
    <li> My husband uses the mirror everyday to shave. He really liked the original fogless shower mirror we had. There is a lot of light in our bathroom but there isn&#x27;t a light over the shower. He loves the LED mirror, there is plenty of light for shaving now!</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect and works as intended and designed, very happy with this purchase. Follow the instruction to the T and this should last for a long while.</li>
    <li> This is my second mirror from Toilet Tree.  At our summer home we have the smaller one, and I was so impressed by it . . . that I had to purchase the larger one for our primary residence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I had used the other brand Z*******, which requires one to \\&quot;recharge\\&quot; the mirror with their wipes or cleaning stuff.  Like Gillete . . . the give a good price on the razor, but clobber you for the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order the Toilet Tree mirror, and you cannot go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMMENDED REVIEW 5/08/12:&lt;br /&gt;After using this mirror for several months, I have to say the following. The mirror does not hold it&#x27;s position when filled completely to the top and using the squeegee.  I use it with about 1/2 filled up and it seems to work better.  Also, after several month of use, I notice that the space used for the shelf to keep the razor is much too narrow.  If they elongate the spine and add one inch, it would be a better unit.</li>
    <li> This mirror was a big hit for my fiance. He loved that he could shave in  the shower and not have to worry about keeping the hair in one spot. After your done shazing cleaning it up is a lot faster. Which I love!</li>
    <li> The Deluxe model is fantastic much better than the original model. I had a minor problem with mine but Steve from ToiletTree took care of it for me on a Sunday, now that&#x27;s customer service .</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now.  It works great. Distortion that can normally occur with plastic mirrors on this item is negligible. I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the performance after using for several months.  Filling the chamber and setting it in place has become second nature.  I have plenty of lighting, so I don&#x27;t use the LED lights.  That&#x27;s the only thing I would change; to offer the larger mirror without the LED lights so I wouldn&#x27;t be paying for something I don&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> This mirror works as advertised. There is no fog at all and the LED lights help spot those stray whiskers. The squeegee and shelf are an added bonus to a great product.&lt;br /&gt;There is no way this mirror is falling off the wall. A combination of double sided tape and silicon adhesive assures a durable mount.&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with this mirror and happy I found ToiletTree. I believe this is a solid purchase and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great,  easy to install The lights are a real plus came with the batteries and adhesive silicone</li>
    <li> Mirror fell off the wall after barely two months.  I followed.the instructions and used the entire tube of adhesive, and never left water in the reservoir after a shower.  Was nice while it lasted, but way too pricy for something that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> it works perfectly! the i use this everyday in the shower and it does not disappoint. it stays on the bathroom wall perfectly.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly this product works.  I have had 2 similar products in the past and they did not work so naturally I was a skeptic.</li>
    <li> I Purchased 2 of these, one for my son and one for my husband both really love them. Very attractive to look at, squeegee great alternative to the anti fog spray and in a dark shower the l.e.d. light is fabulous just be sure to fill back of mirror with warm water my husband new that from his old mirror our son didn&#x27;t couldn&#x27;t figure out why it would stay fogged up all the time ,lol...didn&#x27;t bother reading the instruction I guess.owe ya and no suction cup for it to fall all the time.</li>
    <li> The fogless part really does work. I purposely let the mirror fog before filling with hot water from the shower head. As soon as I filled it the fog disappeared in 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find it any problem to unhook it from the bracket, fill, and replace. The squeegee works quite well also.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained about it falling after mounting. I didn&#x27;t have that problem because the tiny tube of silicone they gave me was already cured solid. I just used some silicon tub/tile adhesive from Home Depot instead and it works fine. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the light button is hard to push and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll break the bracket. The light is not the brightest, but it helps.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again and recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> Mirror arrived as promised and in excellent condition. I am impressed at the large size of the mirror and the fact that it pivots. The LED lights provide good illumination and as promised the mirror stays fog free when filled with hot water. The squeegee is a nice touch too. The only drawback I have found so far is its a bit difficult to place mirror back on bracket without twisting ones self around to see behind while sliding mirror body back on bracket.  This should get easier with practice.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Fogless mirror that I have purchased from TTP going back to 2012.  I decided to try the Deluxe LED after using the regular mirror and also the travel mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point 1 - it is fogless... period end of story.  Putting the hot water in the &amp;#34;tank&amp;#34; will keep the mirror fogless for as long as you want, its science not a gimmick and it won&#x27;t wear off like the coated mirrors do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point 2 - If you install it correctly it will stay on the wall.  My original wall mount is still &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; on the wall almost 3 years after being installed.  I put the new LED mirror in a different shower.  Not rocket science either, put the whole tube of adhesive on the wall mount as shown, peel the sticker covers off  put it on the wall and let it dry overnight.  I cleaned the wall with a little rubbing alcohol on a pad just to make sure it was clean and more importantly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point 3 - The LED Deluxe is a significantly larger mirror than the original, I have a round face shape so the regular mirror was a little small based on the landscape orientation.  Not a problem with the Deluxe, it looks huge when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point 5 - The LED lights are nice, it helps alleviate some shadows but not blindingly bright, I also use this mirror to remove soft contacts on occasion and it really prevents shadows and allows me to see the lens (which is an issue since my vision is not being corrected at that point) after I slide it down off the pupil area.  The battery compartment seems to be reasonably well sealed but a hot shower is a tough environment for electronics so we&#x27;ll see how it holds up, I expect it will be fine.  One nice thing is they don&#x27;t use little tiny screws that will rust for the battery compartment cover more of a threaded friction lock type of fastener, I&#x27;ve seen similar fasteners/seals on boating equipment etc. that is designed for marine environments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point 5 - I rarely use the squeegee just splash some water on the mirror face and it works for shaving, if doing delicate or really close work the squeegee will remove even tiny water droplets very quickly.  Have not had any issues with water droplet stains or buildup on any of the mirrors to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had more of a razor &amp;#34;slot&amp;#34; or hanger instead of just a shelf as I use a heavy DE razor and I won&#x27;t leave it lying horizontally on the shelf but the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog so I can hang my razor elsewhere.  The shelf location under the mirror would probably make it difficult to get a razor out of a slot anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned coated shower mirrors plain shower mirrors etc.  they all usually end up fogging up after some time has passed but NOT these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product line and very responsive customer service when I tore the suction cups on the travel mirror.</li>
    <li> Mounted per the instructions but after 9 months came home to it shatterd on shower floor.  Also, the mirror started to fade around corners.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install, even though I wasn&#x27;t sure it would stick to the tile. Don&#x27;t worry too much about being perfectly level on the bracket because the mirror can move slightly horizontally. I fill it up as soon as the water coming out is warm and it never fogs. Great job!</li>
    <li> Great mirror.  ingenius method to ensure no steaming.  that part works fine.  the only issue i have had is the adjustable height.  after a few uses, the adjustment stopped holding and i have to adjust my height to use it now.  everything else is very well made.</li>
    <li> Great product the only thing missing is the digital time which I had on my old fogless shower mirror and I wish it had a holder for the razor.  The extra light version is a must if you don&#x27;t have a glass door on your shower to let the light in when shaving.</li>
    <li> I got this as gift from my fiancee and really liked it at first.  Unfortunately is suffers from the same problem as the cheap plastic shower mirrors you get at places like bed bath and beyond in that the cheap plastic mirror will not last.  I have had it up for just over 2 months now and sadly can already see the mirror surface deteriorating.  My parents have had a real glass shower mirror up for 2 years now that they got from Costco and it still gives a great reflection.  I honestly don&#x27;t see myself getting even a year out of this mirror even though it cost alot more than my parent&#x27;s one from costco.</li>
    <li> This mirror is excellent!  Rust-free plastic, well designed bracket, excellent fog-free mechanism and the light all make this a truly great bath product.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Everything about this mirror from the instuctions to the squeegee,is first class. I followed the directions for mounting, clear and concise, used all of the adhesive, waited 24 hours and have been using it ever since. Though it&#x27;s made out of plastic it&#x27;s very rugged. I knocked it out of its mount and, full of water, it hit the tub, a five foot drop. Not even a scratch.  I use the LED lights on high and after a month&#x27;s use I&#x27;m still on the first (included) set of batteries. The only improvement I&#x27;d make, or like to see, is to have a model with a 5x magnifying mirror. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great item! Works exactly as advertised! Super easy to \\&quot;install\\&quot; - I let the glue set overnight, not 24 hours, seems sturdy enough. Was fogging up a little in the shower, filled the reservoir, and presto, no fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my Amazon card points to purchase this, but I don&#x27;t know if it is really worth $50. It may be more approriately priced at $30 like the non-deluxe version, which may have been more than enough for me.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy!!! I have really enjoyed this product. The mirror is great and the light has really made a difference for me when I shave. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> At first when I bought this item i was very excited.  After you placed water in the holding area behind the glass it would stay clear.  Just a quick swipe of the squeegee and it was clear.  After about 2 months, the silicone and tape loosened and it fell.  The plastic brace behind the mirror broke off and was un repairable.  I was not able to use it anymore.  It was big disappointment as I really liked it.  I am not sure if I want to spend money for it fall again and break.  The product is not guaranteed not to fall.  It does and when it does the delicate plastic breaks.</li>
    <li> So the title says it all. This was a Fathers Day gift for my husband. He read the directions and hung the mirror himself. We waited the appropriate time for the adhesive to firm up and heard a loud crash a couple days later and there the mirror was, laying in the bottom on the shower like every other one we have ever purchased. The only difference this time was that I paid $50 damn dollars for this one! So unhappy.</li>
    <li> This was installed and operating for about 3 months.  In the middle of one night, my family was woken by a loud bang.  The entire mounting device and mirror had fallen from the shower wall {note there was no water in the mirror reservoir}.  My kids take baths and I was frightened to think that this could of happened while they were in the tub; hitting their head.  Note that I followed the installation instructions to a T and used the adhesive provided.  And the mounting location is about 5 feet on an insert type shower/tub and on the opposite side of the shower head wall, so it receives very little water splash if any.  Unless the manufacturer looks into providing better adhesive or alternate mounting, I would recommend screwing this to the shower wall or not using the product.  Perhaps I received a defective product.  So I will see if the manufacturer responds to this review.  I will also contact amazon customer service to make them aware of this issue.  Thank you.  02-20-16 UPDATE: The president of the company did follow through and send a replacement.  So far it has remained on the shower wall without falling off.  So I assume that the original one had a quality issue.  It was nice to hear that the president of the company followed through on standing behind the product.  I don&#x27;t have to tell you that has been dwindling as the years go by.  One issue that cropped up with the product is that the light stopped working.  I went through the usual - replacing the batteries, etc.  So I don&#x27;t know if the company can just send me the mirror part.  The light is a good feature when shaving.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted.  Note that I upped my rating.  03-02-16 UPDATE: I also contacted the President of the company.  I received no response to date.  I believe this product should last more than 11 months for the cost of $40.00.  If the product description stated that I need to replace this product every 11 months, I would have never purchased it.  I will be contacting Amazon customerservice to voice my concerns.  Due to this update, I have reduced my review back to 1 star.</li>
    <li> Mine just fell off the tile shower wall and broke! The lights on it are useless.  Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> Great shaving mirror, good concept (filling with shower water). The light is so so, not very bright, mirrors &amp;#34;no fog&amp;#34; feature works GREAT, but the 2 sided tape, and silicone adhesive they give you to mount it on a tile wall SUCK! This is my second shaving mirror from this company. I had one at my old place, moved, and bought this new one for my new place. GREAT mirror, works very well, but u better find an alternate method for mounting on your tile wall. BOTH of mine fell off the wall after about 4 months. Luckily, they didn&#x27;t break. I used 3M Hook and Loop strips to mount it on the tile wall, since I&#x27;m definitely NOT going to drill holes in the tile for this.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for husband.  He had no trouble installing it and now has no trouble using it.  I love the razor holding tray, and the squeegee!  Well designed.  Hoping it lasts as long as we need it to.  Would definitely recommend.    Update 8/14/14  Today the mirror fell.  It didn&#x27;t break.  But now we have to remove the adhesive from the shower and perhaps try installing it again.  It was installed per the instructions the first time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several shower mirrors over the years and they have never worked well.  Some relied on a chemical coating that was supposed to prevent fogging and it did for a month or so anyway.  Others rely on batteries that wear out and must be replaced constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is perfect.  It is the gold standard of shower mirrors.  It works on basic science and hot water.  No batteries, no chemicals.  You just fill up the reservoir in the back of the mirror with the hot shower water, squeegee the front with the included squeegee, and you have a completely fogless mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have had this mirror for 5+ years.  I have had to replace it twice because the back of the mirror breaks off where it connects to the wall unit.  Both times it happened while one of my kids was showering.  One admitted he grabbed a hold of it to keep from falling.  The other claims it just fell.  It&#x27;s still a quality product but if I buy a third one I am out $120 on fogless mirrors.  They make a travel version now that sells for $15 ([[ASIN:B008B9DU22 Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed to NEVER fog or your money back! Perfect for Home, Travel, and College Dorms!]]).  I think I will try that one until my kids grow up and move out.  :)</li>
    <li> it has yet to be opened but appears to be just what he wanted.  I will let you know how he likes it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror over a week ago, and it works great.  The mirror image is very clear, and when filling the back of the mirror is a snap because it is attached to the wall very firmly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is unique because it uses adhesive and silicon to mount to the tile.  I have a stone like tile that is not smooth and the suction cup products would never stay on long.  This mirror solves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have decent light in your shower, you can get the one without the led&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This mirror works as advertised.  You have be patient when you install the unit on your shower wall.  You have to wait at least 24 hours for the caulk to cure on the frame to adhere properly to the shower wall.  To ensure the mirror stays fogless all you have to do is to fill the small compartment behind the mirror with hot water.  When you finish showering just empty the water from the mirror.  I have previously purchased other types of fogless mirror that required a solution to be applied to the mirror.</li>
    <li> UPDATED 10/23/13:  Yesterday I received the replacement pivot piece as promised. I popped it in, and was back in business! The updated pivot bracket is black in color vs. gray and appears to be made of slightly sturdier plastic. One thing I definitely noticed is that the mirror slid easily into and out of this bracket, unlike the one that broke, which required quite a bit of pressure. The pivot mechanism works much more smoothly now too. Even with water in the mirror, the whole arrangement feels far sturdier. I am positive this will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that I was quite impressed that the company monitors reviews on its product. I was even more impressed that they offered to make it right. They even included a nice handwritten note and a free nail clipper/file with the replacement part. Companies that truly stand behind their products today are quite rare. ToiletTree is a small family-owned business, and given my experience I&#x27;ll be more than happy to purchase their products again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 10/12/13: The company president posted a comment to this review offering to send a replacement part. In his comment, he indicates the part that failed was strengthened recently. In the interim, I have updated my review from one to three stars as it does appear they stand behind their product and listen to customer feedback. Once I receive the replacement part and test it out some more, I&#x27;ll update my review accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review is below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been through tons of different shower mirrors over the years. Most that promise to be fog-free, are not. This one actually is fog-free, however. He liked that aspect, as well as the lights, mirror size, and the fact that it was adjustable. He disliked having to remove and fill the tank, saying it was awkward to get on and off the wall bracket. He also felt that the brackets on the tilt mechanism were flimsy and worried that they would break. Unfortunately, his fears proved correct, as one of the plastic \\&quot;wings\\&quot; on the tilt mechanism became wobbly then broke after just two months of use. He did attempt a repair, but the mirror was no longer stable enough to remove to put water into the reservoir. Even the slightest bump causes the mirror plus tilt mechanism to pop off entirely. In short, the mirror isn&#x27;t very useful right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he&#x27;s been grumbling about it for the past few weeks, I came to Amazon tonight entertaining the idea of getting him a replacement, not realizing we&#x27;d only had it such a short time! Furthermore, in looking at the tilt mechanism myself right now, I can see why he was so concerned. It truly is a flimsy design. Both of the wings on ours were cracked in more than one place, so it is no wonder why it became so unstable. The wings on the tilt mechanism attach at only two places on either side, making it really easy for those fail. Too bad a cheap plastic part ruined what promised to be a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I&#x27;m not about to spend another $50 and risk getting burnt again. He&#x27;ll have to do with a simple mirror on a hook this time. My advice is to save your money unless the company does a BIG redesign to strengthen that part.as one of the plastic \\&quot;wings\\&quot; on the tilt mechanism became wobbly then broke after just two months of use.

    <li> Mirror works great, is clear and large.  Mounting was easy.  Light helps too. Problem was that top lock screw on battery cover  would not unlock and I had to rip cover off, so top lock screw mount broke. Bottom lock screw is holding cover in place for now, but I worry it will allow moisture in over time and break prematurely.  At least it is working now and best mirror for shaving in shower I have used.  Can&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to lock screw failure.</li>
    <li> Did not realize you needed to fill it with hot water every day!  Outside of that it works just fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he loves it.  It stays securely on the wall, without suction cups and never fogs up.  We also really like the included squeegee and the fact that the mirror tilts.  It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> They thought of everything a product like this would need. I can even see close up enough to shave and trim my goatee and mustache precisely with clean tight lines. The lights really help as well</li>
    <li> The design requires that you fill it with warm water, which gets a little tedious shower after shower. Otherwise, it works as advertised. The light is super bright and can&#x27;t complain about the large mirror.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble. Works as described. Definitely a good buy for any guy who shaves in the shower.  Must have!</li>
    <li> Product does the trick.  The LED lighting not very effective. Probaby could save a little money getting the unit minus the LED.</li>
    <li> I bought this fogless mirror for my fiancee who wanted to shave in the shower.  After researching numerous fogless mirrors, I decided to go with this one and can&#x27;t be happier.  It&#x27;s simple to install but I would recommend waiting a day before attaching the mirror to the base to ensure the silicon sets to the shower wall.  I took the advice from other reviewers who recommended to get the mirror with the light and I&#x27;m happy I did because my shower area is rather dark.  I tested it myself and it definitely does not fog up.  It will, however, if you don&#x27;t put warm water in the reservoir which is the key element that makes it fogless.  The only complaint I have is the price.  It&#x27;s way more than I really wanted to pay for a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> This transformed mirror is now 20% larger than the Original Fogless Shower Mirror. The entire outside of the mirror is illuminated by LED lights. I LOVE that the patented mirror is guaranteed not to fog in the shower. Finally, there is no more suction cups falling off the wall, the removable, soft silicone adhesive secures the mirror to all shower surfaces and will not damage tiles or shower walls.  The mirror conveniently detaches from the bracket so you can easily fill the reservoir before each use and easily detach to empty after showering. There is a handy, self-stored squeegee that removes any excess water from the front of your mirror. The adjustable frame makes the mirror easily usable for tall and short members of your family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of heat and moisture opens the pores and creates an ideal environment for shaving, exfoliation, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ToiletTree Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror makes an awesome gift for your husband, wife, significant other, anyone looking to save some time in their day.  I plan on purchasing one for my father</li>
    <li> I had the ToiletTree non-lighted shower mirror hanging in my shower for over three years and loved it.  But finally it got to the point that it needed replaced because the water spots weren&#x27;t coming off even with the squeegee (I was never good about removing them when I was done with my shower and the water where I live is quite hard -- lazy of me considering it only takes about 15 seconds to do).  But I loved the mirror because it was the only one I used that did not fog up and I tried them all.  I remember thinking many times that the only thing missing from this mirror was a light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I reordered and received a replacement non-lighted shower mirror, I was thrilled to see on the box advertising that ToiletTree had a lighted shower mirror available.  I returned the non-lighted shower mirror and ordered the lighted shower mirror.  I&#x27;m in heaven.  Not only is there light, but the light is framed around the mirror providing BALANCED lighting (unlike the light above the medicine cabinet mirror over a bathroom sink that shines down on your head making it so you need to hold a flashlight under your neck in order to see to shape the bottom of your beard or goatee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big plus was that I did not need to remove the holder for the non-lighted shower mirror to hang the lighted shower mirror, the lighted shower mirror just slid down over the non-lighted shower mirror holder so I was up and running in less than a minute.  This mirror is worth every cent it costs.  If you have a goatee, beard, chin strap, or any kind of facial hair that needs to be shaped or outlined regularly, this is the mirror you want in your shower.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this mirror. It really is fog free. We have bad lighting in our shower so the lights have really helped him see when he&#x27;s shaving.</li>
    <li> This handy little mirror works as advertised and with a quick swipe of the squeegee delivers fogless shaving. It’s not a hindrance at all to fill with warm water especially if there’s an immediate payoff of shave-clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, REALLY want to love this mirror but there are two basic things holding me back. The first is the actual mirror… It’s understandably not made of glass so distorts a bit at any distance over 12 inches. I can get past this as it’s not a huge inconvenience to get up close and personal in the shower. It would be nice if ToiletTree minimized the distortion as the product evolves… The second is a bit harder to get over and involves, well, me. I constantly forget to dump out the warm water. Not a big deal except a few days ago the mirror fell off of my shower wall after being secure for 3+ months. I’m assuming it was because the weight of the mirror filled with water was too much for the silicon. It definitely could have been my “non-pro” installation but I would think it would have fallen after a few days or weeks not 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit didn&#x27;t break so I’m going to find more silicon and see if I can get it back on the wall. I’m considering drilling small drain holes to allow the water to escape if I forget to dump it. It might be a nice product improvement to include a punch out or some other mechanism to create holes for those of us who want the mirror to drain.</li>
    <li> FINALLY a shaving mirror that doesn&#x27;t fall off shower wall! Attractive design, nice size.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Would buy again! I wish it had a little magnification so it&#x27;s easier to see yourself up close.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, so it wasn&#x27;t opened until after the return date. The light doesn&#x27;t work. EXTREMELY UNSATISFIED.</li>
    <li> This is my second one; the first got ruined when someone staying at our house cleaned it with an abrasive sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fill it up when the water gets hots, and it stays perfectly clear throughout my shower, affording me a great shave. The lights seemed like a good idea, but I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll never use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been through a number of shower mirrors over the years. This is the one.</li>
    <li> Purchased the product for a gift and after 8 months the swivel part is worn out and won&#x27;t stay in the upright position any longer.  Good thing it has a warranty!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Just add a little warm water when you get in the shower and it will remain fog free while you enjoy a hassle free shaving experience. I have been using this product for over 3 years without any problems. No more messes with trying to shave at the bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> As with some other reviews about this shower mirror it has great potential but the execution is flawed or cheapened.&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the mirror with water in it is just to heavy for the swivel mechanism. With the normal dings and bumps that happen in a shower the nominal swivel pivot action disintegrates  after around a year for my mirror.&lt;br /&gt;A good quality retrofit for this problem would solve past purchasers problems but maybe to expensive for the builder.</li>
    <li> We love this mirror and it works perfectly.  We&#x27;ve had it on the shower wall for a little over a month now and have had no issues.  The mirror stays fog free and the light is an added plus.  I do think that it&#x27;s a little overpriced and wish I had shopped around for something cheaper but it works as promised and we are happy with it.</li>
    <li> Best fogless shaving mirror EVER!  I&#x27;ve lost count of how many such products I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, and they have almost all disappointed in one way or another.  This product, on the other hand, really delivers.  It is sturdy and, in its way, even elegant.  The added LED light is an extra boon.  Mainly, it remains fog-free in the shower, making shaving there really efficient.  Using the squeegee is the best part--really fun!</li>
    <li> I bought this 3 years ago and it is STILL in great shape and works fantastic! Great buy!</li>
    <li> The mirror does not fog at all.  My new shower curtain allowed in less light, so I upgraded to the Deluxe mirror with LED, and it made a big difference.  The old mirror was pretty easy to take down, also as advertised.  Nothing more to add; it&#x27;s highly recommended if you like to shave in the shower</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband after seeing it at another fancy homegoods site (the price was the same here, so no real discount, but with free shipping I still did better). As the reviews promised, it works very well. It is foggy when you first get in the shower, but after you fill it with water and use the attached squeegee, you are ready to go (the whole process takes less than 30 seconds). It is attractive and clean-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some other mirrors require you to spray with certain chemicals or have finishes that can wear off, but I think this one is purely a hot water trick so there is no need for extra chemicals. You are actually NOT supposed to use glass cleaner on it ever, just a sponge and squeegee. Easy maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I liked this mirror because our shower isn&#x27;t very well lit, and since it is used as a shaving mirror it makes sense to actually be able to see your face. The LED lights are not so bright that they&#x27;d correct for a totally dark shower, but we just needed a little boost of light and this is absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problems with attaching it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, this isn&#x27;t the cheapest mirror out there - but I am pretty confident that we won&#x27;t have to replace it any time soon, and reading the reviews on the cheaper mirrors made me think they were just temporary. You get what you pay for - buy well, and take care of it, and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I splurged on this item because although I have bought several shower mirrors for my husband, none of them seems to last long, and this one seemed &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34;.  We waited until the shower was completely dry to install it, and then another two days for the silicone to adhere before using the shower again.  Still, a week after installing it we heard a big crash, it had fallen off the wall.... my search continues and I am out $50.</li>
    <li> As someone who likes to shave in the shower and has tried many \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors that are in fact, not, I have to say that the simple design and common sense approach works beautifully. It is truly fogless and the light works very well. Finally a fogless mirror that lives up to it&#x27;s name!</li>
    <li> The product works well no problems.  Really has a permanent mount so make sure it is where you want it to be before mounting.</li>
    <li> I love the shower mirror, the leds are very bright and mirror does not fog. I never had Anything shipped so fast!!!! And packaged GREAT</li>
    <li> It is a good size mirror and very clear reflection with out fog . This is one of those purchase that you are so please after been done. Go for it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  I&#x27;ve bought him other shower shave mirrors over the years, but none of them really worked very well.  This one does, and the Deluxe size is perfect for him.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It is a fine product.</li>
    <li> I had one without the light and got this model with LED light when we remodeled.  It works great and has the best anti fog of any mirror I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars because someone actually produced a shower mirror that works as described.&lt;br /&gt;My wife purchased this as a Christmas gift for me it has worked great just follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Well constructed, LED light works great not to dim or overly bright.&lt;br /&gt;ordered another for my son in law a couple weeks ago.</li>
    <li> Update Nov 21, 2016  After three years this mirror gave up the ghost.  First it fell off of the shower wall when the adhesive failed.  I repaired that and permanently attached the backplate.  Now it will no longer remain upright-which was the original problem three years ago. I&#x27;ll have to look elsewhere for a sturdy, reliable shower mirror.  UPDATE:  ToiletTree reached out and sent me a new pivot.  The mirror is now working better than ever.  I&#x27;ve raised my review to 5 stars.  If this pivot fails I will again update this review.  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; I purchased this item in September 2013 and have been using it daily since then.  I am the only one using it, so the only time it gets (re)adjusted is when I happen to bump it when emptying the chamber or when cleaning the shower wall.  Initially I would just re-adjust it and all would be well.  Lately, I cannot keep it in the proper angle without stuffing a washcloth behind it.  In all other respects this mirror has been very good, excellent in fact.  For example, the first set of batteries lasted less than a month, but my replacement Duracells have lasted since then with no noticeable decrease in brightness.  The fact that the mirror will not stay at the proper angle overrides all of the good things about this mirror rendering it relatively useless to me.</li>
    <li> This is my second fogless mirror from Toilet Tree!  I decided on this one because it is a little larger and has lights.&lt;br /&gt;A great product! NEVER fogs! And NEVER falls off the wall!! I also have the travel mirror from Toilet Tree! Another Great product!  Highly Recommended both products!!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I received this product broken. It looks like it may have made a great mirror but I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
    <li> Prior to the purchase of this mirror, my husband would have to splash water on his shower mirror every couple of seconds so that he could see to shave. After reading the reviews on this product, I purchased it for him as a Father&#x27;s Day gift. While installing it, we were confused because the directions didn&#x27;t say exactly how long to let the silicon cure before using the shower, so we left it for about 4 hours (when it actually needed 24 hours) before he got in to shower and shave. The mirror fell down. I contacted customer service via email and the president of the company responded 2 1/2 hours later offering help and/or a complete replacement if needed. Replacement glue and parts were sent out the very next day and received just a few days later. The product works perfectly - exactly as described! It looks to be of very high quality and is extremely easy to use. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a shower mirror that actually works like it says it will.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other fogless mirrors advertised as &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34;, but this one is the only one that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You fill the reservoir in the back with warm water and presto, the mirror remains fog free for the duration of your shower. The design is elegant and the LED lighting is a nice touch. It includes all the necessary mounting hardware including a small tube of silicone to make sure that the mirror remains secure. Shaving in the shower is a manly bliss, and you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this mirror.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and I first thought it was great, the mirror never foged and worked well in the shower.  The adhesive that came with the product did not hold the mirror to the shower for much more then a week.  So I purchased a locktite construction adhesive from Lowe&#x27;s that finally kept the bracket from falling and almost breaking the mirror.  So again I am happy with my purchase but then, about a month later the swivel that allows you to change the mirror angle stopped holding the mirror up at all and now the mirror points down to the shower drain at all times rendering the product useless.  I would NOT recommend you purchase this item unless you are prepared to buy a different kind of adhesive than the one included and then risking the bracket failing a short period after!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent an email to toilet tree products and within seconds I received a reply saying that the bracket has a faulty pivot piece and they are sending me a new one.  Great customer service at least!!!</li>
    <li> we love it !!&lt;br /&gt;doing the job very well&lt;br /&gt; very easy to put  on the wall&#x27;&lt;br /&gt; looking very nice on the wall</li>
    <li> Installation was easy on tile.  At first, I did not think I would be using the LED lights much but they actually come in handy when I am shaving.  And as advertised, it is fog-less as long as you follow the instructions each time you use it.  I have a wand in the shower so it is not hard to fill with water each time and the squeegee comes in handy.  I have tried several other shower mirrors and by far this one stands out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shower mirror for about 4 months.  It was perfect until the swivel base stopped holding the mirror at the right angle.  Now when I fill it with water the base slides to the wall and I have to prop it up by putting something behind it.  Wanted to return it but I guess that ability was lost after 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was an amazing product until this happened!  Now it&#x27;s just an annoying fixture on the shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL RATING:  2 STARS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  4 September 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple of hours of submitting my original review of the shower mirror the President of the company sent me a personal e-mail and shipped me a replacement swivel base.  The replacement part arrived within a couple of days with a personal note from the Director of Marketing, along with an apology gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m stunned - who knew customer service like this still existed.  The shower mirror is once again amazing and it gets my highest recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  31 January 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having the swivel replaced in September 2012 the new one no longer holds the mirror at ANY angle - even when it&#x27;s empty.  What this means is that if you fill the unit with warm water to keep it from fogging up it will not stay straight on the swivel so I have to shave looking at a tilted mirror.  Very annoying.  Also, the light has two settings and the lower setting does not work on mine so when I think I&#x27;ve turned it off it&#x27;s actually on (but the light does not come on) and it runs the batteries down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very close to being fantastic.  I&#x27;m giving it two stars in recognition of the great customer service I received in September 2012 - if not for that I&#x27;d have to give it ONE STAR.</li>
    <li> I originally bought the unlighted version and was very happy with the way it performed. No matter how long a shower I took, it would not fog up. But I always regretted not purchasing the lighted version. It not only is truely fog-free, but throws a nice even light on your face so that there are no hard to see dark areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Thank you, Toiletree!</li>
    <li> Was looking forward to mounting this in our new shower as we have the smaller version and love it.  The package came today and was not damaged but when I took the mirror out to look at it, I saw that one of the button knobs that opens/locks the battery compartment was broken at the base so that the compartment door could not be opened. Could have used the mirror regardless but, hey, I paid extra for it because it had lights.  Returning to Amazon was painless and I&#x27;ll get a refund of my purchase price.  Just about to order another one in the smaller version.  Oh, well . . .</li>
    <li> I purchase a lot on Amazon and this is the first time I am compelled to leave a review. I was really dubious about the claims of &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; but I have to admit that I was truly amazed. After trying other supposedly &amp;#34;fog less&amp;#34; mirrors,  not only does this meet (and exceed) it&#x27;s claims, but the lighting is more than adequate for shaving. For what it&#x27;s worth, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror. Does not fog up, easy to install and looks great! Installation is a cinch although I did have some problems opening the battery compartment.</li>
    <li> Mirror really work----no fog!----easy to mount---I take the mirror out when finished-just in case---really no problem</li>
    <li> These mirrors are absolutely without question THE best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned (this is probably my 3rd or 4th Toiletree fogless shower mirror- no fault of theirs). I bought this one as a replacement for one at a house I just sold and wanted a new one for my new shower...  These mirrors never fog and remain clear for many years.  Couple of tips: Follow the directions when installing -wait 24 hours before you use it so the silicone adhesive will set properly; empty the water reservoir after each use - I didn&#x27;t on my lake house shower mirror and the hard water caused the mirror backing to disintegrate over time (my fault - not theirs).  You&#x27;ll LOVE this mirror!</li>
    <li> Ordered this product in February 2013.  The mirror performed as advertised: it never fogs when filled with warm shower water, which is very easy to do!  The only tricky part was mounting its holding bracket on the wall so that the mirror looks horizontally straight when shaving.  Best strategy is to have the mirror on the bracket at the time it is positioned on the wall.  Once straight, remove the mirror, leaving the bracket&#x27;s tape to cure overnight.&lt;br /&gt;After 9 months, however, the bottom surface of my mirror started to show substantial deterioration. Dull spots appeared  looking like water stains, but they were not.  Could not be removed by scrubbing with alcohol, vinegar, or Lime-A-way.  They originated behind the mirror surface, looking like degradation of the &amp;#34;silver coating&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I called the seller, Toilet Tree Product, and was immediately sent a new replacement mirror, which is working fine.  It looks like the company stands by its product with no hassle.</li>
    <li> The consept of this product is good... the design is BAD..&lt;br /&gt;the LED lights DO NOT shine on your face .... they shine from behind the frame... very indirect lighting&lt;br /&gt;you can not shave by the light from this product&lt;br /&gt;suggest they redisgn to have the LED lights shine directly on the user&lt;br /&gt;product was returned and AMAZON refunded my purchase.</li>
    <li> So far so good, only 4 stars because mirror had a slight defect in it, I thought it was on top of the mirror, I&#x27;d describe like laser rot you&#x27;d see on CD/DVD, it&#x27;s small, but still took away from excitement of getting it.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Fathers Day present to myself. Was hesitant because of some reviews, so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to them. This thing is a must for all men&#x27;s showers. It does NOT fog up, and I stay in there forever now! Brush my teeth, shave, the whole bit, son! It&#x27;s awesome, and as a bonus, the led lights make your eyes look like you&#x27;re in Tron.</li>
    <li> This thing works, plain and simple.  You just can&#x27;t get a mirror to go fogless as well without this invention of having a water tank in the back.  The water tank is super easy to fill and empty, takes 2 seconds, and is worth it.</li>
    <li> I wanted a fog free mirror.. I got one. I wanted one big enough to see my face, I got one. Is it a shower mirror miracle? No. It&#x27;s a bit bulkier than I thought, sticks off the wall about 2.5 inches...  light isn&#x27;t very bright at all, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this mirror. This is his review. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE my Toilettree Fogless mirror.  It has been a great mirror, and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it.  However, about 2 weeks ago, the silicone came away from the wall and the mirror fell and broke.  I talked to Jenna at Toilettree about my issue, and she is sending me a new mirror with a different adhesive for the bracket.  I LOVE the product, and I&#x27;m super impressed with their customer service and willingness to stand behind the product.</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a truly fog free mirror, this is it!  I tried 3 or 4 other products that promised a fog free shave in the shower and was disappointed within one week of using them.  I&#x27;ve had this a few months and it&#x27;s fog free every time!</li>
    <li> This mirror DOES fog up in the shower no matter WHAT </li>
    <li> I should have listened to the reviews, especially the older ones.  I did not install the unit until a couple of months ago and do not use it more than twice a week, as I am retired and do not shave every day.  I installed it exactly as instructed, even cleaning the wall VERY well before using the glue and sticking it to the wall. In all fairness, it worked very well.  Filling it with hot water, very hot, provides an almost perfectly clear (no fog) mirror.  Sadly, and as predicted by some comments, the whole thing crashed into the floor and broke this weekend.  The shower was not on and nobody was in the room with it. The &amp;#34;glues&amp;#34; just let go.  Of course, due to my usual procrastination and late installation, I am a few weeks past the return period.  Do not let that happen to you.  If you do want to chance buying it, install it day one and use it often to see if it will stick.  Mine did not.</li>
    <li> This is the best unit that I could find after I bought and returned at least ten others.  In order to upgrade from here, a substantial price increase comes with it.  This unit has an led light that surrounds the rectangle and is switchable.  Other units have round lights and 5 minute timers.  This unit comes with no suction cups.  It is for serious users only.  The reservoir in back is filled with hot water and under the laws of physics the mirror stays clear.  Magnification options would be an interesting upgrade.  Short of that, this unit gets the job done.  Show me something under $100 that works better and I will add the last star to my review.</li>
    <li> Worked really great and didn&#x27;t fog up and the lights are a bonus to be able to see in our dim-lighted shower...then it fell off the shower wall. Might have to figure out another attachment process as still have the &#x27;glue&#x27; stuck to the wall.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband for the shower&lt;br /&gt;He has had it now for over a year and still loves it&lt;br /&gt;great product</li>
    <li> Everyone should shave in the shower, its great!</li>
    <li> Hubby really loves this mirror. It really works as long as you follow the tips and the light makes all the difference. Over all a great piece of shower equipment. Nicole Maas.</li>
    <li> Really is the best fogless mirror.  I have used and returned several.  This is the best product.</li>
    <li> I just got this and so far after a few uses I really like this mirror. It goes on easily, and filling it with water keeps the mirror crystal clear, the squeegee is a nice touch. I also like the light, you can really get a good shave with that light. Also the mirror is a good size. The only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star is that the instructions say it&#x27;s a 2 setting light but I only get one but that is bright enough. All in all a solid buy!</li>
    <li> SMILPY THE BEST FOGLESS SHOWER MIRROR. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME LOOKING AT ANYTHING ELSE. I am a guy that needs a lawn mover to shave, lol, i.e. tuff facial hair. I have bought countless products so I can shave in the shower while the hair is softer and to save time. This lighter version is clear, does not fog and after using it for a few years (loved it so much that wanted to take it with me to our new place, broke the holding bracket. After sulking decided to call the company. Behold, in this day and age got ,&amp;#34;Excellent customer service, they are shipping the broken part, along with the tape/glue free of charge&amp;#34;. Bravo Toiletree company for standing behind your products. Onwards and upwards.</li>
    <li> This mirror works really well. We&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year and It is the only shower mirror that I have purchased for my husband that actually stays fog free. If it&#x27;s properly  installed it doesn&#x27;t knock free or move around. It also isn&#x27;t easily moved so be careful where you instal it. Make sure you aren&#x27;t going to bump your elbow every morning. Our only complaint is that the plastic &amp;#34;hinge&amp;#34; system in the back stretched after one month and the mirror always tilted downward when filled. We fixed it propping a small bottle behind it to keep it straight. I&#x27;m sure we could&#x27;ve glued it or come up with a better fix but it works for us.</li>
    <li> After being told that the reservoir needs to be filled, the mirror performed very well, lights are great, installation was clean and a breeze.  Special thanks to Steve Parisi Pres of Co. for taking the time and making the effort to respond to uniformed posts like mine...I am now completely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The mirror is easy to use and stays fogless for the entire length of the shower.  It&#x27;s a great size to see my entire face while shaving.  The shelf is only large enough for a razor and nothing more, which i would have liked to be a little larger, or have some accessory hooks to hang shaving accessories.  The LED light around the mirror is a great addition, although it could be brighter to have a little more benefit.  Regardless, it is a great addition to my shower and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, he LOVES IT and it works great, I have also tried it when I shave under my arms, does not fog.  After a few months the top of the mirror (inside) started to fade, but I called the company and they were amazing, they sent me a new mirror and I received it two days later.  Great product, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Actually statys fogless. great product. Jay Madhav</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one for product reviews, really. I read them voraciously, but rarely do I bother to write them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been thrilled with this mirror. I purchased it in December 2014 after reading a glowing review on www.thesweethome.com (and a gazillion of them on Amazon). Amazon delivered quickly, the instructions were straightforward and readable, and I installed it right away. After waiting the recommended 24-hours after install, I took my first shower/shave with this puppy, and it was delightful. It stayed completely fog free, the LEDs did a commendable job of lighting my bearded mug, it held my shaving gear just so, and when a little droplet of water found its way to the reflective surface, I quickly and delightedly wiped that sucker away with the included squeegee. I&#x27;ve used it with joy ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, the horror. In my deepest slumber, I heard a horrific racket from the bathroom. Of course I assumed it was an intruder. I grabbed the phone book I keep under my bed for just such intrusions (just kidding), and wandered into the bathroom to identify the source of the commotion. My beloved mirror had fallen from the tile wall and rest sad and broken on the shower floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wept (but just a little), and went back to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not long after, I shot an email to the company in the hopes they would have some advice for me. Without so much as a question, they immediately offered to send me a new one free of charge and included a silicone remover to get the old goop from the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review, I guess, is to sing the praises of the mirror first and foremost. But it also aims to sing the praises of the company, which handled my issue quickly, fairly, without question, and with the utmost respect. I have been thrilled from tip to tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy the mirror already. It&#x27;ll change your life in small but meaningful ways. And if it doesn&#x27;t, rest assured the company will remedy that for you.</li>
    <li> These shower mirrors are great, I love being able to shave in the shower, and the light really helps me see if I&#x27;ve missed any spots.  I also want to say how awesome the ToiletTree Products company is.  I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for a few years now and I&#x27;ve moved three times and each time they happily and promptly send a new mounting kit, and their customer service is awesome. If I call, someone answers, and when I email, I get a response right away. This is a really nice product, and the experiences I&#x27;ve had with the company have always been wonderful.</li>
    <li> The wide mirror and fog free system is great. It is very easy to apply to the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Lin in SC</li>
    <li> Works great, no fogging, the squeegee is an awesome idea, a shelf for your razor &amp; the LED lights complete the package.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to any man who likes to shave in the shower. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves everything about it! The LED is a huge plus!</li>
    <li> gift for family member who loves it</li>
    <li> The SIZE of the mirror is awesome.  The tilt feature, squeegee holder, lights, et al.. are great.  My shower is very dark and this lights up my face just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to dock a star, though, because the mirror part itself warps and makes your face look a bit distorted, like one of those fun house mirrors.  It serves its purpose and I&#x27;m able to use it alright, but it&#x27;s a bit of an odd feeling when you want to laugh at your face :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, kudos on the product.</li>
    <li> The mirror warps out with hot water in it and shrinks the image and distorts your face.&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect when it is empty and dry but the heat and the weight of the water pushes out the mirror like a dome.&lt;br /&gt;They should have used a thicker material for the mirror. Also the LEDs are not nearly strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy as my last Toilet tree mirror lasted and performed great until it finally broke after many years.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, when hot water is added to the mirror it is completely clear and fog free. LED lights are super bright and so far has stuck to the wall of the shower with ease.</li>
    <li> I bought this fogless shower mirror in August, 2012.  It worked very well as a fogless mirror in the shower for shaving.  It works by filling the narrow tank behind the mirror.  I just held it up to the shower head for a few seconds.  The perimeter LED lights have 2 brightness levels and provide plenty of light for shaving.  The batteries last for a reasonable time unless you forget to turn it off which I did a few times.  The mirror rotates up &amp; down to get the right view angle.  But this is where the product first started to fail.  The up/down angle adjustment has set positions that &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; into place and after a while it doesn&#x27;t hold the position, the mirror just flops all the way down.  There is no adjustment to tighten the detents.  Next to fail was the LED lights.  Its probably not really the lights themselves but internal wiring or some sort of corrosion.  The last time the lights didn&#x27;t work, I thought I had left it on.  New batteries did not help, neither did cleaning the battery box.  It&#x27;s a lot of money to spend for about 10 months of service.  Its a good principle for providing a fogless mirror (backing the mirror with hot water), but everything else failed.  I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money and I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! Very Easy to install</li>
    <li> So I have had a private war with &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors over the last 15 years and finally I&#x27;ve found one that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I can&#x27;t recommend this thing enough.  To be fair, the &amp;#34;hinges&amp;#34; got a little weak over time and I had to use the included squeegie to prop in up underneath the weight of the water inside it.  Yes, it&#x27;s a design flaw. No, it&#x27;s not worth removing a star over.  I ended up planing a piece of wood to fit behind the tilt mechanism and it&#x27;s good as new.  Also, so far, it&#x27;s still sticking on the wall! Again, much better than the other pieces of junk I&#x27;ve monkeyed around with over the years.</li>
    <li> I received this mirror nine months ago. It was doing great for about eight months. Then some spotting started to show up on the mirror. I sent an email to Toilet tree and they responded promptly. They replaced the mirror extremely quickly. After review of the instructions I believe what happened was that the mirror was cleaned with either bleach or glass cleaner. A big no no.  This caused the spotting.  So grateful to Kelly at Toilet tree for the outstanding customer service. Buy this mirror. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband because his old shaving mirror by Z-fogless kept falling off the wall and the lights weren&#x27;t that bright. The suction cups on that mirror never worked properly no matter what we tried. This new mirror by ToiletTree Products is the complete opposite! It was very easy to install and has not fallen once. The light is nice and bright and the magnification doesn&#x27;t distort at all. He also likes the larger viewing area. There have been others who have said that they&#x27;ve had an issue with the adhesive failing for this mirror. My only guess is that they didn&#x27;t let it cure long enough. We&#x27;ve had this new mirror for over 4 months and have never had a problem. Great product!</li>
    <li> My husband has gone through many supposedly &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; shower mirrors, and none have worked...until this one! He has been using it for a couple of weeks, and it has worked great so far. He also really likes that it mounts with suction cups and silicone. I cannot begin to estimate the number of times his mirror has fallen off the wall (usually in the middle of the night scaring all of us!). This mirror seems to be mounted very sturdy.</li>
    <li> This is really a great product. I could never get any other mirror to stick to my tile because it has a rough surface. With this mirror it comes with double sided tape to hold the base in place while the silicon adhesive drys for 24 hours. It is large and I love the LED lights around the edges. Just fill it with warm water and it will not fog at all.</li>
    <li> Despite being guaranteed it won&#x27;t fall off the wall...it did.  Giving it one more try cause we love the mirror</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror. Works perfectly. Went through a lot of them before i got to this one.</li>
    <li> Works well, accept you have to put hot water in it each day to keep the mirror from fogging up? Otherwise great.</li>
    <li> The Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee was purchased on December 2013 for $49.95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family has been very happy with the product up until yesterday, June 5, 2014. The mirror bracket was properly installed on the bathroom wall on smooth, clean, non-textured tiles as per instructions. Yesterday, after filling the reservoir with hot water, the entire unit, including bracket, detached from the wall and fell onto my right foot causing shock and pain. The unit was always used as per instructions and was considered reliable and secure. Nonetheless, the impact caused pain and a bruise on my right foot. All that remained on the wall was the silicone that once held up the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider purchasing the original Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee as it is smaller, without LED, and could be supported by the bracket.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve owned this product. The first time was a gift a friend purchased for me from my wish list. Unfortunately, water leaked into the battery compartment and disabled the light function. I find this battery compartment lacking with a true &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; seal. However, I recently purchased this product again for myself and surprised to find no modifications were made to prevent water from truly leaking into the battery compartment. Therefore, I&#x27;ve taken the extra step to use silicone caulking to seal the lid to the mirror preventing water from finding its way into the area. I wished the company would provide a more secure way to seal it without &amp;#34;hacking&amp;#34; it but I DO enjoy the product and find it meets my needs to shave in the shower. Unless I use a cup to fill the mirror with warm water, I take the mirror off the wall holder and place it under the shower head to fill it prior to use. I realize I will have to remove the silicone caulking when the batteries die out but until then, I&#x27;ll keep my fingers crossed. A lithium battery with a tighter waterproof seal would be a welcomed change to the design of this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this mirror and it works. You just have to make sure you put very hot water into the chamber and bammo - clear shaving.  The silicon adhesive wore off after 7 months. I called the company AND a person answered. Five minutes later, I have another tube of adhesive on the way. Solid product, do the right thing customer service..</li>
    <li> Great product! It&#x27;s exactly as the description of the seller.</li>
    <li> Works as stated, LED&#x27;s help but not a world of brightness. Overall a great shower Mirror. Just fill the thing with hot water lol.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t fogless, I like the light, which was the main reason I bought it. I&#x27;ve had fogless mirrors in the past that were truly fogless. This isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Sturdy when installed as instructed. Works well - just as advertised. It&#x27;s great to shave in the shower. Adequate lighting - not super bright.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, would definantly purchase it again</li>
    <li> The mirror fogged immediately! I give it two stars because it&#x27;s a nice product the light is really nice the mounting hardware makes it very stable. I was really hoping it wouldn&#x27;t fog up tho. :(</li>
    <li> It is so easy and great to use. It was a quick install and works great. Easy to keep clean..</li>
    <li> Male/35 purchased because i wanted the LED one, and I have a second shower to put the old one in.&lt;br /&gt;My first one was and is great.  It did not have the LED on it.  This new one does.  I&#x27;ll hopefully never need to go without one.  They work perfectly, and they are well mounted.  You can also use the LED mirror on the non LED back.  I&#x27;ll be taking the non LED when I travel.  I cant stand shaving out of the shower anymore.</li>
    <li> Works well, if it had magnification, review would be 5 stars... Pretty sure others that had trouble with the mount not staying secure didn&#x27;t follow the specific mounting instructions.  Update; after owning this for 6 months it is time for an update. As others mentioned,he original silicone mounting held for 4 months before crashing to the shower floor. This caused the tilting bracket to break. I was able to glue it in a fixed position &amp; remount using a heavy dose of 30 yr outside silicone. Still up after 2 months...... I have changed the review to 3 star.</li>
    <li> The convenience of shaving while in the shower cannot be overstated and this mirror provides that.  It is easy to install, excellent in quality, and simple to use and keep operational.  However, I would be first in line to purchase a new model if it were a bit larger and had a magnifying capability.  I need to use my glasses with the current model, and since they fog up, i have to do without a clear view to shave.  If you have 20/20 vision, then go for it!  But I&#x27;d like to know when the new model comes out and I&#x27;ll sing its praises...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, great quality, good performance, but could stand some tweaking to be great.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift (Christmas 2012) and it works exactly as advertised. I am very happy with how it has performed in the 17 months I have used it. Installation was simple as were the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Fog free as advertised, but the LEDs are very dim and I can actually see better with them off. They cast a shadow on my face and make the reflected image dark. About the only thing they light up is the water spots on the glass, making it almost impossible to see. Old mirror I had magnified the reflection a bit, making shaving much easier. This mirror does not magnify. The price it way too expensive for such a cheap made product. Like I said, doesn&#x27;t fog up but save money and buy the non-lighted version.</li>
    <li> The fogless mirror exceeded my expectations.  It looks attractive, is functional, and works as advertised.  I have tried three other products and like this one the best!</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk for the $40 it sells for. First of all the stand is too small for the weight of the mirror which means you have to stick it on the wall and the adhesive pads are too small to hold it for any length of time. Being fogless means you have to fill it with warm water each time you use is and then empty after each use..that means taking it off the bracket. The light button has to be pushed in so far that it&#x27;s impossible to do it without taking it off the bracket. Any review that says this is worth the money is untrue,</li>
    <li> Installation was a breeze and the product is working as advertised. Well thought out product. Planning to order a few for my friends as well.</li>
    <li> I am pleased overall with this product.  It does not fog as long as you fill the reservoir with hot water.  The squeegee works well and so far, it has not budged on the wall.  My only concern is that over time with having to take the mirror on and off to empty the water, will the silicone eventually give out...I guess I will have to wait and see, but I do receommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good size and clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lights are almost useless, unless you put your face up against the mirror, and even then not much better.</li>
    <li> i have had several types of  shower mirrors in the past, none lasted very long.....this seems to be the best one yet.....mirror did not fog up at all....we only have a skylight in our shower, so the mirror lights are important.....they did the job but they could be even better.....i&#x27;m hopeful that i&#x27;ll finally get some longevity out of this type of product.</li>
    <li> Fell off the shower wall after a few months</li>
    <li> My mirror arrived on time but when I tried to access the battery compartment, there was a minor flaw in the manufacturing that prevented one of the screws from releasing so I couldn&#x27;t use the LCD. I called ToiletTree expecting that I would have to take the time to ship the product back, wait until they assessed the situation, etc. and all I wanted to do was have an extraordinary shave in my shower! Well, after they listened to my story, ToiletTree sent me a new mirror via Amazon that arrived two days later...no questions asked and no extra charge. The mirror was easy to mount and works even better than advertised. I&#x27;m impressed with the product but even more impressed with the company. That is what customer service should be like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. John</li>
    <li> The LED lights do a good job of lighting the mirror, but not your face, which makes the light more of a novelty than anything else.  The provided silicone adhered well to my wall for a couple months, but then the weight of the water broke it loose.  Fortunately it didn&#x27;t break when it fell, but before hanging it again, I drilled numerous holes in the back of the mounting plate so the silicone has more surface area to adhere to and it seems to be better suited to stay in place for the long haul.  Filling the reservoir with hot water definitely does the trick at keeping it fog-free.  Would be better mounted 90 degrees so that the mirror was more proportional to my face (my face is longer than it is wide which is how most Americans are... except for the super morbidly obese segment which is gaining ground quickly).</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Coming from a guy who saves his head and face everyday in the shower this is great product. Only thing I would improve is the light, it&#x27;s too dim and needs to be brighter. Otherwise good to go.</li>
    <li> Did not have adequate maneuverability, cannot be used outside the shower. Also, no magnification. Would like to return</li>
    <li> This item is wonderful.  Works exactly as described. Would recommend to everyone. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase.  I Would definetly purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had a little apprehension about purchasing the product due to its price point. However, now that I have it installed in my shower, it&#x27;s the best money spent. Installation was a breeze. Allow silicone (removable) to set up overnight and you&#x27;ll be all set for the following day. Ingenious feature on the mirror in which you fill up the back with hot water, thus making the mirror the same temp as shower water, which results in no fogging!! The accompanying squeegee fits nice in its slot and works excellent. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t seem to have two LED settings.  Unless you&#x27;re counting on and off as two settings, which the description clearly disputes.  The one LED setting I have doesn&#x27;t seem bright enough to be of any use.  The lighting I have is more decorative than functional.  It&#x27;s difficult to see in, but that might because I have poor lighting in the shower.  Which is the reason I was looking for a mirror with lighting.  Maybe I&#x27;ll get some LED buttons lights and put them on the ceiling or wall for better lighting.  Otherwise, it seems okay.  I mounted the bracket and have yet to use it.  I still have to wait for the adhesive to set.  I think I probably mounted it a little too high.  If you&#x27;re using this for shaving, you might want to mount it a little low so that you can tilt it up and see your chin and neck a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I&#x27;m dropping it down to one star.  The LEDs are really worthless.</li>
    <li> Works great so far.Easy to mount.Has a bright light and stays fog-less when you fill it up. I recommend this mirror</li>
    <li> Works great... until the adhesive comes off and it smashes to the shower floor after only two months.  Contacted customer service to get a replacement part and there was no response.  I guess I am going to give up my search for a shower mirror.  None of them seem to meet all the requirements.  UPDATE: Great customer service.  Quick resolution to my issues.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this fog free mirror!  Tried many others in the past but this is the first that is truly fog free. Adhesive really works well. A breeze to attach to shower tile. Just thoroughly clean tiles before adhering as recommended by mfgr.  Buy it - you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> too much trouble and basically only for the shower as you have to fill with water and empty.</li>
    <li> Fairly easy to install (peel &amp; stick pads AND silicone glue, included) great size, handy shelf for razor, squeegee is nice touch, battery lighting is great feature.  Mirror slightly distorts image.</li>
    <li> I love my ToiletTree Shower Mirror!  I have gone through three other mirror&#x27;s and have been frustrated by lights that shine in my eye or worse yet don&#x27;t provide enough illumination.  Others required constant re-application of non fogging sprays to get them to remain functional.  Other&#x27;s are small and impossible to see your entire face.  This product provides a solution to all of those problems! I fill it with hot water from my shower head in about 5 seconds, place it on its mount and turn on the light.  I get the most comfortable shave ever right in the shower...no separate mess.  Do yourself a favor and buy this mirror!!</li>
    <li> At $40 this is a steal, I paid $50 and I love it. I get such a better shave in a nice hot steamy shower. Mounted easily and firmly, feels like it is part of the wall. The fog-less is not perfect, the hotter the water the better, but the science is what it is but the design of the unit makes it easy to use. The shelf could be a tad bigger but it will hold a standard razor just fine.</li>
    <li> Awesome.....Bought one for my friend already.  Beats the more expensive Sharper Image Mirror.  Hope it will last awhile.  Only had it for several months.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> The product is good.  The best I&#x27;ve ever had as one who shaves in the shower.  But as most shower products are plastic, they break when they drop.  I bumped the mirror and knocked it from the &amp;#34;swivel&amp;#34; that holds it to the wall mount.  The edging broke at one of the corners and even though I was able to put it back together, it had a slow &amp;#34;leak.&amp;#34;  I thought, &amp;#34;My bad&amp;#34; for breaking it.  I called ToiletTree Products to replace it, &amp;#34;Kelly&amp;#34; upon hearing my story is now sending me a new mirror and an upgraded swivel which secures the mirror better...... without any cost to me.  That was very much appreciated.  As one who owns &amp; drives two Jaguar E-types and an Austin Healey 3000MKIII, I&#x27;m reminded by one of my good friends who repaired them.  He would say that the difference between his business and others doing the same thing, is that when something he did on the cars &amp;#34;broke,&amp;#34; he made it right quicker than sooner.  That&#x27;s what he said metters.  He added just about everything man makes can break.  Those who make it right the quickest are the ones you want to deal with.  ToiletTree Products made it right, right away without any questions.  That&#x27;s hard to come by...even when I didn&#x27;t think it was their fault.</li>
    <li> My husband loved using the fogless shower mirror after I gave it to him for Father&#x27;s Day.  Unfortunately, the light broke after only 6 months of use.  The product is hard to use without a light source.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time getting my husband to shave every day. He loves being able to shave in the shower. It doesnt fog up and gives off a lot of light.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT:&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is great!  I&#x27;ve had several &#x27;fogless&#x27; mirrors but none have ever stayed fogless.  I usually have to splash water on the mirror until it warms up enough that it doesn&#x27;t fog.  It will clear up the fog but then you are left with large water droplets on the mirror.  The last mirror I had with an LED was the [[ASIN:B00A3Q7EMI Zadro ZFogless Fog Free Lighted Shower]]  This one was OK but the clock on it was slow and needed adjusted every few months and it fogged up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ToiletTree mirror is an excellent concept.  It&#x27;s easy to pull the mirror off the stand and fill with water.  It&#x27;s also easy to reattach the mirror as the clip is large and fits nicely into the stand.  The integrated squeegee and small shelf for my razor are perfect.  Have had zero issues with it coming loose on the wall.  I used the epoxy and self-adhesive pads that were pre-installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had with this product was a broken clip on the battery door.  The &#x27;unlock&#x27; screw did not unlock when turned to that setting.  I pried up on the door but it broke.  Using the number provided in the packaging, I called and the President of the company answered immediately - no answering system.  They quickly offered to send a replacement.  I am still waiting on it to arrive and will edit my review to include the functionality of the LED light - which I have not been able to use yet.</li>
    <li> This works great but found the backing system did not adhere to the tile and it fell down.  But we have reattached it with a different system and it is staying put.</li>
    <li> This worked for about 3 months then would not light up and even when it did light up it was very lacking and could not shave by this light alone, also started fogging up the 3rd week.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> this thing is the best!!!!  I love it</li>
    <li> great product, doesn&#x27;t fog up and comes with a mini squeegee that really works.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these mirrors, one for each bathroom.  My son and husband have had no complaints about them and believe me if there were problems they&#x27;d let me know.  Being that I am only five feet tall the mirror in the master bath is set pretty high and the only problem I see is they are very tight and difficult to adjust.  Fortunately I don&#x27;t generally need to use it.  We recommend this particular mirror as they are far superior to any other type we have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> The mirror is quite distorted and the shelf is rather small as you need it for storage.</li>
    <li> For a man with a shaved head this mirror is VITAL to the weekly head shaving.  It was larger than anticipated and fits my whole head in the mirror.  The mirror is not glass and will not break if dropped.  The lights are nice and bright and sometimes I use them as the main light in the shower at 4:30 a.m. The razor blade holder is not really beneficial to anything perhaps a surface for mold to grow!?!?  It should have some holes for air flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE HUGE DOWNFALL!!!  It fell off the wall after about 3 months of use.  I followed the instructions EXACTLY and it came crashing down in the middle of the night and scared the $#!^ out of me and the family.  I remounted it with construction adhesive and will be a nice benefit for the new homeowner.  Thankfully it did survive the fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does prevent steam buildup by filling the area behind the mirror with hot water.  Simply fill and empty when your done shaving.</li>
    <li> Love this thing!  So great for shaving in the shower.  And customer service from the company is great.</li>
    <li> Purchased as gift for my son and he loves it!!</li>
    <li> The good - Very sturdy when attached to marble wall, mirror is very large compared to all other shower mirrors which I have used over the past 20 yrs, light works well, but not really needed. The Bad news - Unfortunately, the mirror fogs up immediately and never clears up (with or without hot or cold water being placed into the reservoir). This was very frustrating, especially after gluing mirror to wall, which required a recommended one day dry time. Last -The mirror has no adjustment for magnification, and in fact, the mirror was the total opposite and made me feel further from mirror, almost like the view you would get from the passenger mirror on your car. I was very hopeful. Fogless mirror, no way!</li>
    <li> My son loves to shave in the shower but the portable mirror always falls off over the course of the week and bangs on the shower floor. We were worried about cracking the tile, so this was a perfect solution and it never fogs up!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had many shower mirrors that fall in the floor, break and fog. This mirror does exactly what it claims to do. I thought it might be cumbersome to have to fill it with water each time before use and squeegee each time when done but it&#x27;s easy as can be. Great size and I love the way the squeegee tucks out of sight into the frame. Would certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Although the mirror itself is good, the after 6 months, the super glue fell!!!</li>
    <li> What can I say? It works as advertised and sure beats using a hand held mirror.</li>
    <li> The product is good but it would be much better if the mirror be large and magnified.  The LED lighting also needs to be improved with more powerfull lights.</li>
    <li> Ok maybe that&#x27;s a bit much but...this product does what they say it will do despite my initial skepticism. C&#x27;mon how could there be no fog in the shower? BUT that&#x27;s exactly the way it works. In the past I would blindly shave in the&lt;br /&gt;shower - and it looked that way when I got out and wiped the bathroom mirror to view my missed patches. This takes care of all that - just fill the cavity with hot water, squeegee the mirror and you are in &amp;#34; shaving heaven &amp;#34;!!&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I shave I can now say &amp;#34;Io son felice!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grazie tantissimo to ToiletTreeProducts&lt;br /&gt;And btw my wife got me to try this product and I should know - &amp;#34;Mia moglie ha sempre ragione!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> All aspects of the sale met my needs. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fog-less ability. Keep up the good work. Thx</li>
    <li> I recently purchased ToiletTree&#x27;s Fogless Shower Mirror.  The mirror installation instructions were easy to follow &amp; the mirror performs as advertised.  I would recommend this product to all who are interested.  RH.</li>
    <li> This is truly a fogless shower mirror.  I purchased this for my son (he has tried other mirrors) and this is the first one that has remained clear throughout his shaving process.  Installation was quick and easy.  He also likes the fact that the mirror lights up making it easier to see in a dark shower.  The only slight negative is that, as other reviewers have noted, the mirror distorts your image slightly but not enough to be a nuisance.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these mirrors, one for my husband and the other for my son this Christmas.  I had read the great reviews for this mirror and decided to take a chance since both my husband and son prefer to shave in the shower.  My biggest concern was how much of a problem it may be to fill the container on the mirror w/water every time you shower.  To my delight it is no hassle at all!  You simply lift off the reservoir from the wall attachment and fill while showering and place it back on the wall attachment to shave and there is no fogging at all!  Both my husband and son love this mirror!  It was easy to attach to the wall, took about 20 minutes to read instructions, decide where we wanted to place it and attach it.  And looks like it would also be easy to remove from the wall if necessary.  I rarely would write a glowing review about a product, but this is really a great mirror.  It stands true to the claim \\&quot;fogless\\&quot;, is easy to attach and easy to use.  It also comes w/a squeegee and a light.  I don&#x27;t really think the light is necessary unless you shower in the dark!  All in all we are very satisfied w/our fogless mirrors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other shower mirror, but this one does everything I want quite nicely.  Installed easily on to tile, I let dry for 24 hours as per instructions and it seems to be holding solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never fogs up so long as I fill it with hot water when I get in the shower.  Lights don&#x27;t seem to make much difference one way or the other, but I guess they&#x27;re nice if you have a particularly dark shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a Christmas gift from my wife.  I have purchaed many many fogless mirrors from various stores and they seem to work for a time but always seem to give out and start to fog up in a month or two.  Figuring how much we had already spent on previous products this seemed like a no brainer.  All I can say is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; this thing really works.  It is very to use and the light around the edge comes in very handy for dark showers.  I am very very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase and really nice shower mirror.  Do not let the price fool you it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great, I was a little uneasy mounting it with the sticky tape/silicon that came with the kit, so I used 3 velco 3M command strips instead.  My shower is cultured marble/plastic, and I know how hard it is to scrape clear silicon off.  You have to fill the mirror with water every time for it to work, and then use the little squeegee to wipe the water that gets on it, but it works well after you do.  The built in light is ok, I don&#x27;t really use it.  It would be nice if it had an auto-shutoff feature like some of the other mirrors I have tried.  There is no magnification, which I like.  Some of the magnified mirrors gave me headaches.  So if you are looking for a simple, large mirror with no gimmicks that doesn&#x27;t have mounting hassles this is the one for you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros...&lt;br /&gt;Large Size&lt;br /&gt;Fogless feature works&lt;br /&gt;No magnification/distorted image&lt;br /&gt;Lighted&lt;br /&gt;No suction cups to deal with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons...&lt;br /&gt;Permanent Mounting (Used command strips instead)&lt;br /&gt;Hinge is a little wobbly, mirror doesn&#x27;t sit level&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: a few months after using this and the hinge can no longer support it, I stuck a sponge behind it to hold it up, but the hinge is a bad design.  Downgrading to two stars...</li>
    <li> This is the first shower mirror my husband has ever had and he loves it.  Doesn&#x27;t fog, lighting works well and it&#x27;s big enough.  There are only a couple of reasons I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating.  One, is that it would have been nice to have the option to dim the light.  It&#x27;s really bright even when the bathroom light is on. And, it would be nice if the mirror were vertical instead of horizontal since that is truly the shape of our faces.  Otherwise, this is an awesome shower mirror and we highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I researched and researched the perfect shower mirror for my boyfriend&#x27;s Christmas present. After reading all the fabulous reviews on this premium and regular version of this mirror I decided this was the best choice. The mirror works great. My boyfriend enjoyed 1 shower shaving with this mirror however about an hour after it&#x27;s first use the mirror crashed to the ground. I following all installation instructions. Cleaned and alcholed the wall, used the adhesive in all the specified spots and waited over 24 hours before adding the mirror to the mount. It fell! I am extemely disappointed. The adhesive was clearly defective and now I must return the mirror I searched for and my boyfriend loves (at least the ONE time he got to use it). Amazon is providing a full refund and shipping to return it. I am just extremely bummed this \\&quot;no fall\\&quot; mirror FELL. The mirror it self works perfectly and I do plan to re-purchase it again once my refund comes thru. Hopefully next time I will get some non-defective adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!! 2/29/12&lt;br /&gt;  We have been using our replacement mirror for several weeks now with no issues. It works exactly as described. My boyfriend and I are very pleased with the product. I def recommend this to anyone. We are very happy customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!! 2/26/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror fell again. After less than a year of use. It fell about 8 months ago but I forgot to update this. My boyfriend really enjoyed it while it lasted buy I after this second fall I gave up on it and bought a cheapo mirror off Amazon for $10. It may not be as fancy as this one but it works just as well and I do not see it falling anytime soon.</li>
    <li> My husband saw this in a Frontgate magazine and asked me to order.  Since I like ordering through Amazon.com, I came here to order (same price BTW) but prob better shipping cost with Amazon.  Hubby loves his new mirror.  Nice application for hanging and easy to fill each day in the shower with warm water.  The opening to fill is the entire top of the mirror so you don&#x27;t have to open anything to fill with water just hold it up to the shower stream and you are good to go.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT - BETTER COMPANY! By way of disclosure, this is an updated review, and Has changed how I will review my purchases in the future. I wrote a tepid review for this product, and now believe the company deserved better. They did not ask me to retract my original review, but instead made my experience right. And quickly. This proved a willingness to help, when needed. Second, this is the third generation of the product - they are working to improve a very useful product! In the future, I intend to wait a month before writing a review. I especially hope that more companies wii take constructive critisizm and respond how Toilet Tree Products has!</li>
    <li> What did I ever do before I had this?  This completely changed my shower shaving experience for the better!  Super awesome product that actually lives up the hype.  Fog-free, easy to mount and use, has a light, has a razor shelf and even includes a squeegee to remove water spots for the best shower shave experience.  If you&#x27;re debating which size to get, I HIGHLY recommend you go for the deluxe (larger) size since it lets you see your entire face without any fuss!  Super highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Iget this for my husband and I disappointed with this purches Don&#x27;t buy this..</li>
    <li> This is the most quality fog less mirror we&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and works perfectly.  I have used one for years and like the larger size.  The only thing I wish they would do is make one with 2 or 3 times magnification, as that would be better in my judgement than the lights, which will only be of value if disco comes back and they are made to throb with the music.&lt;br /&gt;Also, to avoid trying to empty and then line it up with the wall mount each day, I drilled a 1/24&amp;#34; hole in the right bottom corner to allow it to self-drain over a few hours.  It doesn&#x27;t interfer with the functionality and allows me to just fill it with the shower wand portion of the shower head assembly each morning.</li>
    <li> Is mounted and useful as advertised. Good product! Good shaving!</li>
    <li> This mirror is a true time saver.  It delivers as promised without fogging, and It also helps provide a comfortable shave in a steamy shower.  I have purchased two, the first one left behind in a move.  I would recommend this to any man who has to shave on a regular basis.  On top of the great product there customer service is very responsive and delivers a great customer experience.</li>
    <li> The LED Fogless Shower mirror works just fine.  I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 years and it hasn&#x27;t fallen of the wall yet.  Keep in mind when it says &amp;#34;Deluxe&amp;#34; it isn&#x27;t.  Both models of this brand are the exact same size.  I purchased both so I should know.  Other than that it&#x27;s still a good shower shaving mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror!  No fog and the LED lighting is great!</li>
    <li> Works great in the shower!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005OSQGN8 Deluxe LED Fog less Shower Mirror with Squeegee by Toilet Tree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.]]The mirror adjustment failed after three months of use. I think the weight of the water and adjusting the mirror multiple times caused a early failure. The idea is good and a heavy duty adjustment bracket might be the answer. The product did work foglessly. The water spots you deal with. If you are going to shave in the shower then when the improvements are made this will be the fog less shower mirror for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband about a year ago after he kept stealing my standing makeup mirror to use the shower to try and shave. Obviously that was not working too well. We knew we would be moving when I have it to him so he waited to put it up until we got to our new place. So he has finally been able to use it and he loves it! Once you put the water in, it does not fog that entire shower. He has been thinking about getting the travel one for when he goes on trips. I would recommend this to all men who want to shave in the shower!</li>
    <li> Design and idea is great but mirror is poor quality and begins to deteriorate quickly.  Within a month or two you start to see defects in the plastic mirror and now after several months of use it is almost unusable.  Would be perfect if they used a better quality mirror.</li>
    <li> Fooled the kids, they thought it was a tv at first!  After a recommend of a friend who has the unlighted version..and then reading reviews; we went with the lighted mirror.  My husband said it is amazing, the fogless feature works well with the price.</li>
    <li> Trust me, you need this in your shower! Perfect daily companion - the alternative for your non-dependable wife...LOL</li>
    <li> I used this mirror once. The defogging design absolutely works but the mirror only stayed on my tile shower wall for a day, in spite of the fact that I used not only the adhesive pads but also the silicone adhesive included with the product. So the \\&quot;Designed not to fall\\&quot; design was grossly inadequate on my very standard tile shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I was disappointed with the so called \\&quot;shelf\\&quot; with this mirror. I use  a [[ASIN:B002FC7B2G Merkur Long Handled Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome #180, 10 Double Edge Platinum Blades]] for shaving and would not trust this shelf to hold my, or any high quality razor, safely. Don&#x27;t think this \\&quot;shelf\\&quot; will eliminate the need for a good shower caddy or something similar. If you&#x27;re using it for an inexpensive disposable razor it&#x27;s fine but if you use quality shaving equipment, don&#x27;t even consider the shelf as being useful for anything other than the included squeegee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning for a refund and will try the \\&quot;original\\&quot; [[ASIN:B003BQ6QXK Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall.]] smaller version with the hope that it will stay up as designed.</li>
    <li> Well built&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install&lt;br /&gt;Solid on the wall&lt;br /&gt;100% fog free&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback; light could be a bit brighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several so-called \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; or \\&quot;fog-free\\&quot; mirrors over the years. They all pale in comparison to this product. This will easily be the last fogless mirror I&#x27;ll ever need to buy. It&#x27;s so superior to any of the other wannabes. Like McDonald&#x27;s, \\&quot;I&#x27;m Lovin&#x27; It\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I really was hopeful about this product.  It has great reviews and I actually liked it until it fell off.  Before you  click the \\&quot;No\\&quot; button if this review was helpful- YES, I did follow the instructions.  I was concerned that the unit would not stay adhered to the wall in a wet environment, and rightly so.  The unit fell off within a week of use.  I  cleaned the wall with alcohol like the directions stated and emptied the reservoir after each use.  The unit came crashing down and almost hit my toes in the shower.  The adhesive actually failed on the side of the unit itself, not the shower wall.  One of the cheap plastic pegs that holds the mirror on the base broke off as a result, rendering the device useless.  I give the mirror more than one star for a good concept but I can&#x27;t give it more until it can stay on the wall.  If it worked like it is designed to, I would give it 5 stars.  But for now, it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Sure, it would be easier to have a fog free mirror that doesn&#x27;t require any maintenance; but non of those products actually works. This product works...period. I had the non-lighted version for well over a year and it never failed. I bought this version after I moved (left the old mirror in the shower) and am equally happy with it. In fact, I like it a bit more due to the lights. The lights make shaving easier in a darker shower area, and aren&#x27;t so bright that they create a glare or bother my eyes in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Great item works perfectly!!!  Would recommend to anyone that shaves in the shower.</li>
    <li> Easy payment. Fast shipping. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is really a very nice shower mirror. It comes with its own squeegee which is cool. I like the fact that it stays put once it&#x27;s installed. It&#x27;s got a place to put your razor also. All in all my husband and I are pleased with this purchase. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the ABSOLUTE BEST mirror I have EVER used!! It makes shaving in the shower SO easy. You fill it up with hot water, turn on the light and boom you can shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently moved and could not remove the mount from the shower wall... I contacted the company and they sent me a new mount for FREE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product and GREAT customer service!!</li>
    <li> I really like this.  Good sized mirror, well thought out product.  very easy to fill with water and place in holder. And the holder does stick great on my tile shower wall.  Don&#x27;t have to stick it to the glass door, I can actually have it in a better place for shaving.  If only it had bluetooth speakers, it would be out of this world!</li>
    <li> Very clever concept! Most mirrors lose their fogless coating in a week or two, but this doesn&#x27;t rely on coating.  They stick to good old science - that isn&#x27;t going to wear off.</li>
    <li> I had to go out and buy my own appoxy and the light died within 3 months. The hinge to adjust the angle broke after about half a year but I just stuck the cap of a shaving can behind it to hold it in place.  I&#x27;ve  been using it for 3 years now and still works as a shaving mirror so I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much. I will probably have this for 3 more years before it&#x27;s time trash it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It was very easy to install and it works just as described.</li>
    <li> Mirror installs easy and works well.  If water gets on it, it does tend to spot but really doesn&#x27;t affect the use of the mirror.  I called the company and they said to use white vinigar and polish with car wax.  That did remove the spots but they did reappear but again it really doesn&#x27;t affect the use of the mirror.</li>
    <li> Perfect shave everyday.  This is a super product no one fault.  Easy to install. Easy to use. FOG FREE GUARANTEE</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005OSQGN8 Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced my Sharper Image metal fog-free shower mirror with this product. After nearly destroying the Sharper Image product during it&#x27;s removal from our prior address I was looking for something that did not require a plumbing connection. Overall the product works as advertised; I was annoyed by packaging, the included adhesive quality, and the quality of some of the materials which I will detail later. First the positive aspects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The product does indeed work as a fog-free mirror so I can shave in the shower&lt;br /&gt;2) Installation was relatively easy and required about 15 minutes to position and install&lt;br /&gt;3) We have an enormous shower, so the up-lighting from the LED lights is a positive (works great - two brightness settings is unnecessary for me)&lt;br /&gt;4) Integrated squeegee is a nice touch (lacks a handle for those of us who no longer have child size hands)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasons I did not score this product with 5-stars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) The silicone adhesive sent with the product was dry and hard when I received - I had some silicone caulk which I used. It would have been a hardship for me to return the order to Amazon or go buy additional silicon adhesive at the hardware store. How annoying! I suspect this company used a very low cost Chinese manufacturer and provider of the silicone that comes bundled with the product. Also, they appear to lack a quality management program that would have weeded out this annoyance prior to delivery to Amazon or the end-customer (me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) The materials used in the manufacture of the product appear to be really inexpensive. I&#x27;ve not dropped the mirror, but the fact that it hangs on a \\&quot;latch\\&quot; mechanism and is used in a wet environment with hard flooring increases the risk that it will break on impact. Perhaps they could have coated the cheap plastic with rubber to make it more impact resistant and less \\&quot;cheap feeling.\\&quot; Another alternative would be chrome or stainless metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) I&#x27;m annoyed that I have to pull it off the wall to fill with water for a fog free experience. This is not an impossible task, but as I mentioned in (B), I really dislike the latch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D) The orientation should be portrait, but the product can only be installed in \\&quot;landscape\\&quot;...my face will hopefully remain longer than it is wide for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E) The squeegee needs a larger handle, it works OK, but I have to pinch it like it&#x27;s a sewing needle. This shows a real lack of consideration for who is using the product...it&#x27;s not a 4-year old or a lobster using the product, it&#x27;s a grown man! Please size the squeegee for a grown man&#x27;s hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;F) This product needs a razor handle holder and a shaving cream holder. The shelf is OK for the razor handle, but my razor feels precarious laying on the ledge and I would prefer a holder that is simply a loop or hole to place the razor handle into. The shelf will not hold a can of shaving cream, unless it&#x27;s sized for a doll. If you are going to produce a large plastic product to hang on the wall at least design it so it has more utility for all the aspects of a grown man&#x27;s shaving experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 2013: Yes, it truly does lack quality in the tilt mechanism. 17 months into ownership and the tilt has failed - the mirror hangs in a depressive \\&quot;down\\&quot; position and no amount of tender coaxing will bring it up to where my face is for the shave. ToiletTree has made some nice progress promoting their products on other online sites. Perhaps it&#x27;s possible they have updated the product in the 17 months since I purchased with the bad batch of silicon.could have coated the cheap plastic with rubber to make it more impact resistant and less \\&quot;cheap feeling.\\&quot; Another alternative would be chrome or stainless metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) I&#x27;m annoyed that I have to pull it off the wall to fill with water for a fog free experience. This is not an impossible task, but as I mentioned in (B), I really dislike the latch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D) The orientation should be portrait, but the product can only be installed in \\&quot;landscape\\&quot;...my face will hopefully remain longer than it is wide for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E) The squeegee needs a larger handle, it works OK, but I have to pinch it like it&#x27;s a sewing needle. This shows a real lack of consideration for who is using the product...it&#x27;s not a 4-year old or a lobster using the product, it&#x27;s a grown man! Please size the squeegee for a grown man&#x27;s hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;F) This product needs a razor handle holder and a shaving cream holder. The shelf is OK for the razor handle, but my razor feels precarious laying on the ledge and I would prefer a holder that is simply a loop or hole to place the razor handle into. The shelf will not hold a can of shaving cream, unless it&#x27;s sized for a doll.

    <li> This mirror can also be mounted in any shower. It comes with the strips, adhesive and batteries for the lights. Not to mention it comes with a small squeegee. You may also place this mirror on any counter or vanity. If the ladies need to put their makeup on simply take down the mirror and turn the light on. The surface is a good size about the same dimensions of a I-Pad and convenient to store away when not needed. When it is all set up, it kinda reminds me of a small panel television. I highly recommend this product for it&#x27;s functions and versatility for our everyday lives. Who doesn&#x27;t need a good mirror in the morning!</li>
    <li> Does anyone know how to get a hold of the manufacturer regarding this products failure?  I purchased this product because it received so many great reviews; however, after having it about 6 months the mirror fell in the shower.  The glue is still stuck to the shower and the water reservoir cracked during the fall and is no longer functional.  Until now we have been very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Great, well thought out product.  It mounts via double sided tape and apoxy.  I&#x27;ve had it hanging for months and no problems supporting the weight, which is substantial.  You fill it with warm water to keep it from  steaming up. It comes with a little squeegee for wiping the mirror after filling. It has a bright light in case your shower is dark. It has a little shelf for razor storgae.  It&#x27;s well built and sturdy. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I like this product as it is a time saver for me in that shaving is not a process for after the shower but during - and I think it better for your skin to shave after or better yet during your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one complaint I would have to register is that when the mirror is filled with water it is difficult to angle the mirror as the weight from the water causes it to flop down.  So instead of having the perfect angle on the mirror, you have to find an angle that the mirror will accommodate with the weight of water, which does in fact, perfectly prevents the mirror from fogging.  So I would recommend mounting the mirror so upper or lower angle adjustments are not needed.  Other than the previous mentioned flaw, this is a nice product that I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Tried a few others, don&#x27;t bother with anything else. Get this one!</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace a fogless shower mirror for my husband.  He had the first one for about 8 years.  It was the kind that attaches to the shower nozzle.  I wanted to get something really good and the promises in this one got me to purchase it.  That was 3 months ago and yes, it does not fog and no it did not fall down, and yes, the mirror itself is a good size but he can no longer keep the mirror angled at the position he needs to use it.  So the product doesn&#x27;t fall but the mirror does.  so now he has to use his one hand to hold the mirror in place while he shaves.  waste of money.  i would NOT reccomend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Wow!  A rep from the company contacted me and they will replace the problem at no cost to me.  They stand behind their products.  I will update again if it is resolved.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Received the replacement part.  Installed and all the mirror is back to working condition.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, the mirror works as advertised.  It&#x27;s a great product, and I would highly recommend it.  That said, I have had a couple of issues with it.  The product gets 5 stars -- more importantly, the company&#x27;s customer service gets 5 stars.  I liked the product so much that I purchased another for my Father&#x27;s birthday.  When it arrived, they were unable to open the battery compartment.  They called Toilet Tree and without hesitation, they shipped off a replacement.  My Father loves the mirror as well.  When I moved, I called them, and they shipped me another mounting kit at no charge.  After about a year of use, the articulating bracket got stripped and the mirror would stay at the lowest position.  Again, I called them and they shipped me a new and improved bracket -- again at no charge.  So, although there have been a few inconveniences with the product, its quality and their excellent customer service result in me being a raving fan.  Great job Toilet Tree.</li>
    <li> EDIT 11/04/2012 - Within 24 hours I received an email from the President of ToiletTree Products and he wished to make sure he could fix any issues I was having with the product.  This type of commitment to a product is rare in today&#x27;s market. I would not hesitate to recommend this product or to buy future products from this company.  Thank you ToiletTree Products for listening to your customers and standing by your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Post 11/03/2012 -I bought this product in January 2012.  This worked as advertised out of the box. A few months later the tilt mechanism stopped working properly. When I put water in the mirror the mirror would tilt all the way down.  No big issue I put small travel shampoo in between the wall and the mirror and the angle was fine.  However, on November 1, 2012 at 3:00 am the mirror,which is designed not to fall, fell.  This scared and woke the family up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product light worked fine, the fogless design worked great.  The angle device and the \\&quot;designed not to fall\\&quot; failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how to return this or if it will be replaced.  I looked to contact the seller to see what they advised but could not find any contact information.  Amazon has a return but it will cost me in shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my opinion of the product is that it was great the first couple of months and then it began to fail.  The product did not last a year without issues. Customer service??  I am unable to evaluate.  The fact I will have to pay out of pocket to send it to Amazon and then wait at their mercy for a replacement is another negative with this product.</li>
    <li> Superb!  Mounting is easy and secure when instructions are followed. It is completely fogless.  It saves me time each morning.  All pros, no cons.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> This product works GREAT!!!  This is not my first shower mirror.  The first one I bought would fog up constantly and was simply a hassle as a result.  Not this one.  Simply fill it with hot water and you have a fog free mirror for the entire length of your shower or bath.  Simple to install, it comes with a small tube of silicone which is plenty to hold the mount securely to the wall.  The mirror tilts to adjust to the different heights of your family members, and yes they will use it even if they are not shaving, especially if you have teenage daughters.  However this tilt, while convenient,  became problematic when the mechanism began to lose its grip and the mirror would flop down.  I called Amazon and, great as the Customer Service Dept always is, they were willing to deduct the cost of a new mount or refund the purchase cost.  I really didn&#x27;t want to return it because I love the product.  Amazon provided me with the number for the manufacturer and told me to find out how much the cost would be for a new mount.  There was no need to get back to Amazon.  I called the company and they were aware of the problem.  They have designed a new mechanism and they are sending me one at no cost.  The rep told me that I could expect it in 1 or 2 days.  Awesome.  I would imagine that any new order will come with the new mount so you won&#x27;t run into this problem.  If you shave in the shower, or just like looking at yourself and don&#x27;t we all, then you should buy this mirror.</li>
    <li> This works very well, but unless you have a very dark shower, you probably don&#x27;t need the model with the LED lighting.  The tube of silicone glue that comes with the device was already congealed / solid, so I sent an e-mail to the company and they sent me a replacement tube - good service.  Of course, as a do-it-yourselfer, I didn&#x27;t wait for the replacement - I used a rubber cement / contact cement tube of \\&quot;plumbing\\&quot; glue, which worked fine.</li>
    <li> For the price of this mirror its great! It hasnt fogged yet and very easy to apply in my shower.</li>
    <li> Awful. Simply awful. Fogs up immediately. Worst purchase ever. Do not buy!!!!!! Oh, it doesn&#x27;t stick either.</li>
    <li> this is the best shower mirror a person can ask for... honestly I wanted one like this for years because the shower in my basement is kind of dark... NOT ANYMORE!</li>
    <li> My old fog less shower mirror would not stay I unfogged and the suction cups were no longer holding. This comes with a reservoir to fill with hot water so it does not fog up in the slightest, and silicone to attach it to the shower so that it stays up. I am super happy with it.</li>
    <li> After cycling through all the cheap, poorly performing showers mirrors over the last couple of years- and there are many of them- it was refreshing to find a moderately priced product that actually does what it supposed to, namely 1) not fog up 2) stay on the wall 3) not fall apart.  Nice work ToiletTree.</li>
    <li> Five stars all day long, just wish it were brighter; could use twice the lights in a dark shower.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband.  We were very disappointed that it was broken when it arrived.  By the time I gave it to him it was past the time that the company accepts returns so it was money down the drain.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life?!?  I&#x27;ve been looking for a fog less mirror for ever!  I&#x27;ve been to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and nothing that makes the mirror like this.  I used to have the flex mirror that attaches to the shower head but that broke off after a month.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and it seems like the silicon is holding nicely and the squeegee is awesome at keeping the spots away.  LED is bright enough to see everything you need.  GREAT product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great mirror. It works better than any other shaving mirror I owned. The only negative thing I can say is that it took a bit long to ship. Other than that I love it!</li>
    <li> PROS:  Works great for the first few weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  The glue doesn&#x27;t come off as easy as they stated.&lt;br /&gt;  The Mirror fogs up regardless of how much or how hot the water you place inside of it is.&lt;br /&gt;  It starts to rust and just looks nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product. EVER AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I used to have a shower mirror which used suction cups to hold it to a smooth surface, like smooth tile or glass.  I think I bought it from The Sharper Image about ten years ago.  After a while it would fall.  Sometimes it would scare the $#!* out of me because it would fall in the middle of the night.  After ten years of falling, the plastic holding the suction cups broke off for the past several years I was just propping it or just holding it while I shave.  Also, it would fog up, though it was supposed to be fogless.  I came across this one that you fill with hot water to keep it from fogging.  The enclosed silicone did not work well.  It may have been that it didn&#x27;t really come with enough silicone.  So I bought some RTV silicone from Home Depot and stuck it to the travertine tile in the shower.  It stays in place!  It&#x27;s nice to have this in the shower to shave with.  A little pricey, but if this can last me 20 years or so, I&#x27;ll be happy.  Even though I had to use my own silicone, I still give it five stars.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the mirror I bought from you as a gift for my husband. He is extremely satisfied with the quality and its usefulness. It was easy to instal and looks very elegant and complements our modern bathroom.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this, what a great gift for him!!! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Shaving in a steamy shower is great for a lot of reasons. This product makes it easy while solving the typical fogging and lighting problems. I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews, but ToiletTree has really gone above-and-beyond when it comes to customer service so I wanted to put in a good word. I had some problems with mounting the mirror in my shower (epoxy sticking and removal issue). They bent over backward to ensure it would work. Other reviewers on Amazon have pointed how they really stand behind their products and I&#x27;ll add my voice to the chorus: Thank you! It&#x27;s up and working exactly like it should. I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I loved the old Toilettree mirror; but my shower is not well lit,this is perfect!  Lights well, nice that it&#x27;s larger too; and as always....no fog!</li>
    <li> This mirror was great for about 6 weeks.  Then it appears that it gets water behind mirror and makes it so it is not clear.  For $50 I expected it to last longer.  Really disappointed in the mirror finish.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would find a shower mirror for my husband that didn&#x27;t fog and fall off the wall!! Although this mirror must be mounted on the wall pretty much forever, it is sooo worth it!! It stays snug in place and the mirror slips right off the mount for easy filling from the shower.  The lights on it are bright and my husband has never enjoyed shaving as much as he does now!  Overall I definitely recommend this mirror.  The price might make you hesitate for a minute but I promise you will not regret it one bit! You will spend more money trying out all the cheap mirrors and having to toss them because none of them really work!! This is the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
    <li> Just a quick response to a previous review, generally your beard area is wider than tall unless... your shaving the top of your head? Make sure you look at the response from the company on the battery compartment because after that everything is great!  I have had several shower mirrors since I have been shaving for more than 25 years in the shower, this one is clearly the best!  I have had cheap ones that the mirror is so small it is hard to see.  And like a previous comment the mirrors that are plumbed in simply do not last.  The LED lights are very nice and I didn&#x27;t think I was going to really use it but once you do you won&#x27;t stop.  This is a quality product and built very well, I will look for more to come from this company!</li>
    <li> I have tried countless \\&quot;Fogless\\&quot; mirrors and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  Not only is the mirror area hug and, the light  super bright (&amp; dimmable)....it actually stays fog free.  The mirror comes with a pivoting wall mount that is easy to hang with double faced tape &amp; silicon glue.  Knock on wood, it has been up securely since Christmas Day.  There is also a good sized shelf with a built in squeegee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is pull the mirror off the slide-in mount and fill the reservoir with warm water and it stays completely fog free!!  The warm water actually sits behind the mirrored surface and keeps the temp warm enough to completely eliminate the fog.  It really is the best shaving mirror I have found!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend to anyone!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 small things I would suggest to the manufacturer - 1 is that it would be nice if there were 2 or 3 hooks under the shelf to hang razors, poofs, etc.  and 2 it would be great if the light automatically shut off after say 15 minutes as I have forgotten to turn it off several times.</li>
    <li> The ToiletTree Deluxe Fogless Shower Mirror is a tremendous product.  It is very well made, works exactly as advertised (even better) and is very attractive.  This is a winner product.</li>
    <li> This is the first truly fogless mirror I&#x27;ve found. This was purchased as a gift for my husband who really wanted a magnified mirror for the shower. However, because the surface area is larger than most mirrors and it has 2 settings for the lights it works just great. Also, the attachment system is far superior to other shower mirrors we&#x27;ve tried. Great Product! Lives up to the description! Thanks to ToiletTree for a product that exceeds expectations.</li>
    <li> Up Date:  I bought another one of these mirrors after moving.  Still like the product; however, this one got water in the battery compartment which stopped the lights from working.  I let the thing dry out, cleaned out the corrosion, put in new batteries, but the lights still don&#x27;t work.   It looks to me like maybe he little rubber gasket around the door was missing.  So, not happy with that.  This a a great product.  The Mirror assembled and went up easily and is large and illuminated.  So, if the shower is dark, you can still see for a good shave.  The squeegee is a good idea and useful.  It was not clear to me when reading the product information on line that you filled the mirror each time with water from the shower, but that is no big deal.  Also, you should let people know that batteries are included.  One other comment, when you do fill the mirror, the shape of the mirror changes a bit and so your image appears further away than when it is empty.  Kind of a cool carnival effect.  One suggestion for improvement is to have hooks for the razor(s) so you can more easily keep two on the mirror.  Overall, very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Upon opening the box the battery compartment would not open. One of the battery compartment&#x27;s locking latch screws was stuck in the locked position on the inside of the battery compartment. I hope this is not indicative of the quality of the illuminated bathroom mirror. I emailed the company last night and called them on the phone today (voicemail) and have not been able to talk to anyone or hear back from anyone yet. And I hope *this* is not indicative of the responsiveness of  the customer service. I want to resolve this problem, if possible, as quickly as I can.</li>
    <li> I have had this for over a week now and I have no complaints. Installion was easy and it seems to work very well. A little pricey, but the best option I have found for a tiled shower.</li>
    <li> Fairly simple to use and a greta concept.  However, the battery life can last less than one week and the clock resets with each battery change.</li>
    <li> I bought the mirror for my bf for Valentine&#x27;s Day...he&#x27;s in the Navy and has to be clean-shaven all the time but has sensitive skin.  His shower curtain makes it too dark for him to shave and shower but this mirror&#x27;s light and squeegee seem to be working great!  Easy installation and so far so good, no complaints and he says he loves the mirror!  Product was delivered as described and by the projected delivery date!</li>
    <li> i have been using mirrors in the shower for a decade.  This is by far the best one i have come across.  Secure connection to the wall, DOESN&#x27;T FOG UP, and the light is excellent.  Can i give it a 6 star rating?</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Travel Fogless Shower Mirror\\&quot; actually works. The problem with mirror in the shower is that they \\&quot;steam\\&quot; over with condensation. You wipe them off to have then \\&quot;steam\\&quot; over again. This \\&quot;Travel Fogless Shower Mirror\\&quot; has a reservoir to hot tap water that is used to keep the mirror warm. When using the attached squeegee is used to wipe the mirror, then you&#x27;re good&lt;br /&gt;to go. My husband like shaving in the shower, he said to get a close comfortable shave and now with this \\&quot;Travel Fogless Shower Mirror\\&quot; he can see what his doing. It&#x27;s great for a gift too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband when his previous shower mirror fell off the wall and he said it wasn&#x27;t worth putting back up. This one is exactly as described. It slides off the bracket easily, is easily filled with shower water, slides easily back on the bracket, and doesn&#x27;t fog at all.</li>
    <li> It is exactly as advertised.  Easy to install using both silicone and tape; both provided.  I have read a couple of other reviews that said the mirror was hard to get on and off the mount; this is absolutely not true!  Lighting is excellent.  Price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Designed not to Fall&amp;#34; - yeah, maybe during the first four months. That&#x27;s how long it took mine to fall down in the middle of the night and scare the heck out of me when it clanged to the bottom of my shower. It broke, and is now useless.  I did everything as was in the instructions: cleaned the surface before application, applied the sticky pads, applied the silicone, let it all dry before use. During the months I actually used it, I never left water inside so as to not have it hold unnecessary weight. Whenever I finished use, I would promptly throw the water out. Still, after four months, the silicone failed. I would not buy this again.  *** UPDATE FROM JULY 2015 *** As you can see from the comments below, promptly after posting my review, Toilettree&#x27;s CEO wrote me, and after a brief email exchange he sends me A BRAND NEW MIRROR. No questions asked!! Just fantastic customer service!! I am revising my review to 4 stars. Mistakes and faults can and will happen in life, but it is all about how you are treated in a situation like this, and this company is amazing for being so nice and quick to replace a faulty product with absolutely no hassle. Thank you Steve! :)</li>
    <li> I just used the shower mirror for the 1st time this morning.  It was great.  Totally fogless.  The only problem that I had was in applying the bracket to the wall.  When I started to use the silicone, the tube was solid and could not be squeezed out.  I even stuck a tooth pick inside to try to loosen it up.  Couldn&#x27;t get that to work so I went to Home Depot and bought some GE silicone.  It worked great and I am very happy with the product.  This was only a minor inconveince and the $3.21 for the siclicone gel isn&#x27;t going to change my life style very much.  I do recommend the product.</li>
    <li> The light is straight up useless. dificult to control tilting.  You know the rest.</li>
    <li> light isn&#x27;t bright enough and mirror doesn&#x27;t stay fog free, not worth the money, wish i could get a refund</li>
    <li> First of all, let me start by saying that if you are not shaving in the shower, you are not living.  If you stand over your sink and get water and hair everywhere while cutting your face, you are doing it all wrong.  If this is your first step into the shaving in the shower realm, you are doing it all right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first fogless mirror that I have purchased that actually doesn&#x27;t fog up.  I have purchased probably 6-7 fogless mirrors before and they are usually pretty good for a little while and then within a month or so are useless.  I feel like at least three of them had \\&quot;Z\\&quot; in the name.  But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is great, it is not distorted in any way.  The lights are adequate.  The shelf is a bit small, but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is an expensive shower mirror, but I wish I would have purchased long ago though, because it would have saved me money in the long run.</li>
    <li> The mirror is just the right size and absolutely fog free if used according to directions. Easy to use and handle.</li>
    <li> I loved the product at first and it worked perfectly as described. However four months later it no longer stays in a vertical position. The weight of the water used to keep it fog-free makes it pitch downward. Even if I position it all the way &#x27;up&#x27; it falls back down -- almost like that part of the device is stripped.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product.  Permanently fixed to my shower and the product is not fog less, I really thought for the money I was getting a great product.  That is not the case.</li>
    <li> This shower mirror was unbelievable easy to install. I liked it so much, I ordered a second one to go in my other house. I only wish there was a better way for larger and shorter people to both use it. Maybe a swing arm would do the trick? Thanks again ToiletTree and Amazon for a great product and great service. Sincerely, Timothy A Springfield</li>
    <li> (Excerpts from an interview with my brother, who got the shower mirror as a birthday gift.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried is fog free except this product.  It works perfectly, I love the lights, and the screen is so big it&#x27;s like shaving on a notebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke one of the two knobs on the back that access the battery.  I unscrewed it all way instead of just turning it. I should have read the instructions beforehand, but I&#x27;d seen that kind of knob before and thought I knew how to handle it. So, now that knob is covered with duct tape. It&#x27;s really my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love it and actually look forward to taking a shower.</li>
    <li> I held off doing this review until I had the mirror for a couple of months. I cant say enough good things about it. The sheer size of it sets it apart from the other shower mirrors and the LED turns great into &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34;. I have had four other shower mirrors including those a radio in them. None of them hold a candle to this one (and the radio mirror lasted exactly 23 hours until it fell off the wall and broke the radio). The other mirrors were much smaller so you had to get close to them to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most shower mirrors use suction cups and the mirrors I have owned had a nasty habit of falling off the wall... usually at 3:00 a.m. This mirror uses silicone glue to mount it to the wall. Yes - it takes a few more steps and a bit of planning to mount it but it is worth it. We remodeled our shower using &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; tiles so suction cups no longer worked. I had to find a mirror that mounted in a different way. Before you worry about gluing it to your tile, I had to move it and after I peeled it from the wall, I was able to quickly clean up the silicone by simply rubbing it off and using a bit of Goo-Gone. So it is a &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; mounting that you can remove, clean up and reposition. I dont know if this works on slate so if you have a slate shower you may want to check with the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it is simple - you fill it with warm water when you are in the shower (the mirror comes off the mounting bracket very easily), place it back on the bracket, use the included squeegee that stores in the base (that is pretty slick!) to clean the drops off the mirror, and shave. It never fogs (due to the water inside) and tilts up and down a few degrees to move it into the optimal position for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - the Pros - Size, LED light, squeegee to clean the drops off the mirror, mounting bracket, tilting bracket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; I can think of after using it for a couple of months are that the LED lights dont turnoff automatically - but this really isnt an issue since LED doesnt drain a battery like a normal light, and there is no &amp;#34;auto-drain&amp;#34; feature. Most mirrors that you fill with water slowly let it drip out to empty it. This mirror doesnt have that - but having the water drain like that can cause a calcium stain so dumping the water after use doesnt bother me. Neither of these &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; detract from the awesomeness of this shower mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the most expensive shower mirrors out there but it is well worth the money and is (based on what I have seen) the largest out there. Spend the extra money and get this mirror. You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Works well; function as described. Strong attachment to the tiles on the wall. The LED light adds a great benefit.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best. Install was a breeze. Quality is top notch. And if you were considering getting the one without the LED don&#x27;t. If you absolutely don&#x27;t need it than by all means but you will love having the light. What a breath of fresh air to finally have a mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up and mounts strong to any surface. How much money people waste buying junk from the store all these years. ToiletTree hit a home run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this……period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert&lt;br /&gt;Denver, CO</li>
    <li> I would think a fogless mirror would be fogless correct?  I paid extra for the deluxe version hoping it would work, but the only thing you pay for is the better lighting and mounting options.  The mirror does not stay fogless.  Returning and shipping back is not worth my time, but I figured I would warn others.  Good mirror, but you will need to run the warm water across it to remove the fog.</li>
    <li> After more &amp;#34;fogless mirrors&amp;#34; that I care to count . . . . I tried the ToiletTree LED variety and I am so glad that I did!!  It is by far the best I have every owned, including ones that I spent much more money on. If you enjoy the convenience of shaving in the shower, and having a fogless lighted mirror is what you are looking for, then you owe it to yourself to give this one a try. I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s see.... Shave in the cold bathroom or shave in the warm shower with the steam to help open the pores. Warm shower please. Very well built and has been great.</li>
    <li> For the price of this product I wanna say its okay. My bf loves it bc he says it makes shaving so much easier. I don&#x27;t like that you have to put hot water in the back every time, it scares me that it will get mildew, mold, slimy gunk, but so far that hasn&#x27;t happened. We&#x27;ve only had it up in the shower for abt 2 wks. Also we rent our house and have to move soon. I&#x27;m interested to see if we can get it down to take with us. If not I totally wasted my money :(</li>
    <li> I would give this product 50 stars if I could. It&#x27;s easy to mount &amp; holds strong, LED lights help when shaving, squeegee works great.....all around an A+....... it does what it says it will do!!! Everything you will need is included in the box&#x3D; instructions, silicone glue for mounting, squeegee &amp; batteries. Just fill up the reservoir with hot water from your shower head and your good to go. THIS IS THE ONLY TRUE \\&quot;FOG-LESS\\&quot; MIRROR----- don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else!!! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** I have been using this mirror now for 6 months and it stills works like new!!! Has never fogged up one single time and I use it daily. The adhesive mount is still holding very strong too! I got 4 AA rechargeable batteries with a 2 battery charger so I can have two batteries in the mirror and always keep two batteries charged up. The LED mirror light still works great too and is still very bright! I tell all my buddies about this fog-less mirror ----- it&#x27;s a must have!!!!!!  A+++++++++</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I&#x27;ve finally found an awesome shower mirror that mounts well and works as described. Filling it with warm water each time takes 15 seconds and that&#x27;s so little to ask with the benefit you get in return. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Excellent shower mirror. Easy to use. One small negative - requires gorrilla tape to securely mount the base. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> 04/27/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just received my replacement part for the pivoting mechanism. I must say the customer service I&#x27;ve received from this company is A-1!!!. In this day and age I find that quite refreshing!  I will be checking in again in a few months an let you know how it&#x27;s going.  Today my rating is going up to a four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;When I first used this product, I LOVED it.  However before a year was up the pivoting mechanism for the positioning of the mirror wore out and it is almost useless to me.  The mirror has a water reservoir in the back which is filled with hot shower water which keeps it from fogging up but the pivoting mechanism is made of plastic and it wore out quickly.  Definitely not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I have shaved in the shower for almost 40 years and it has become my morning ritual. We have well water here and the hardness/softness can fluctuate due to my lack of proper tracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such I have had the need to replace my shower shaving mirror every second or third year. The mirror surface would become dull and pitted, water spotted and scratched due to the constant cleaning in attempts to bring the mirrors back to their original condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the ToiletTree Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror due, primarily, to it&#x27;s high rating here on Amazon. After 45 days of use I could not be happier with that decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The installation was done with ease by simply following the well thought out instructions and using the adhesive supplied. I gave the mounting bracket a full 24 hours to set-up, as instructed, before actually using the mirror and have had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added size is welcome, she square shape is, hands down, a cut above the round mirrors I had been using in the past. The daily fill with hot water is painless and quick, the emptying procedure is self explanatory. The supplied squeegee is adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED light is more than adequate. The only improvement I could possible like to see is the light being timer activated; more than once I have had to reach back into the shower to turn off the light after exiting. No biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I pleased? Very much so. Would I purchase another? In a heart beat.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised. Good quality and works well. I liked the way they did the mounting. Easy, but no way it will fall. Would have given 5 stars, but the led lights stopped working on the second day. No biggie, but I did like them. Other than that, I really like the design and functionality, particularly the squeegee and how it&#x27;s designed to slide into the little tray underneath. That&#x27;s smart thinking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
    <li> This mirror is the best I have found so far i would recommend this mirror  also was shipped very quickly</li>
    <li> I have gone through tons of &amp;#34;Fogless shower mirrors&amp;#34; They never live up to the description or the job they are supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this product. Does what it is supposed to time after time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving in the shower is such a great process and this product makes it possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. So far we have had it about a year. Lights still work and it&#x27;s very convenient to have in the shower for him. I don’t think it would have made much difference if he would have purchased the smaller version for less money though. Overall great product and I would buy another one if need be.</li>
    <li> After muddling through a number of awful shower mirrors over the last few years, I&#x27;ve finally found one that checks all the boxes, and truly does everything right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It attaches to the tile shower very well, and feels rock-solid once the silicone adhesive has set.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It is BIG!  Larger than any of the others I&#x27;ve seen on the market.  This, coupled with the ability to tilt it, means that it works for me (6&#x27;3\\&quot;) to shave, and for my wife (5&#x27;9\\&quot;) to remove makeup.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It lights up brightly.  While a lot of shower mirrors have a light on them, I haven&#x27;t seen any as bright as this one, which is great for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;4.  It has a holder for my razor.  I had a mirror before with a type of \\&quot;hook\\&quot; to hold my Fusion razor, but it was flimsy and would drop often.  The shelf on this one is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;5.  IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!  While I&#x27;ve had shower mirrors in the past that worked well for a couple weeks before the anti-fog coating wore off, this one seems like it will last for the long-haul.  The reason is the way it works:  The mirror slides easily off of its bracket, and you fill the back with hot water to match the temperature of the shower.  After that, you can use the included squeegee to wipe off the water drops.  The whole process takes about 5 seconds, and the mirror stays perfectly fog-free for the duration of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to install, doesn&#x27;t fog, and quick shipping.  I would buy from ToiletTree again.  Haven&#x27;t had to use the customer service but I am sure from the reviews I&#x27;ve read they will be great.  Thank ToiletTree for a great product!  Keep it up!</li>
    <li> I was initially very impressed by this mirror. I was able to mount it with no problem using the silicone gel and instructions and after two months it remains securely attached to my bathroom wall. However, there is a major design flaw. The compartment that holds the batteries is poorly sealed and after a week or two of use, the LED light would not longer work. I cleaned out the battery case, replaced the batteries, and made sure to tighten the screws on the compartment as far as they would go, but to no avail. After a few days of use the lights no longer work. Very little light enters my shower, so the LED light was one of the features I was most excited about. If you purchase this mirror, you shouldn&#x27;t expect the lights to last.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews of the product before purchasing it. And I can tell you that it is exactly as advertised. The unit is very easy to lift off the bracket and to put back on. Filling it is a snap, and it will NOT fog up once filled. The larger area is very useful, although I haven&#x27;t needed the light. I would highly recommend carefully following the mounting instructions. But if you do, you will love this product.</li>
    <li> lighting dim and wall mounting failed in less than a month.</li>
    <li> Works great and able to see really good to shave while in the shower.</li>
    <li> The LEDs are not very bright, but the fogless feature works great.</li>
    <li> mirror doesn&#x27;t shut off automatically and the fogless part only comes in to play if you make sure that you put hot water in the reservoir each time you get in shower</li>
    <li> Easy installation, clear view.  Works as advertized</li>
    <li> Not bright enough. Works otherwise</li>
    <li> Great mirror for shaving in the shower. It absolutely does not fog when used correctly. One minor annoyance is forgetting to pour off the warm water when done shaving...and dousing yourself with cold water the next morning.  My real complaint is that the mirror crashed down in the middle of the night after about two years, scaring me out of a deep sleep.  The silicone glue is still permanently on the shower wall; the mirror simply came unstuck from it.  So, sadly, I&#x27;m back to shaving at the sink before my shower.  I also want to stress that my installation was meticulously perfect (I&#x27;m a little neurotic about following instructions). To prove that point, I have a much larger and heavier wall-mounted dispenser made by Simple Human that has supported the weight of body wash, shampoo, and conditioner for about five years.</li>
    <li> Mirror image is not crisp, more reminiscent of old metal mirror images of camping days rather than glass mirror. If you can order a higher quality mirror on a movable mechanism, you&#x27;d be better off</li>
    <li> This Item works - it&#x27;s great being able to shave in the shower with a mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up. The light is a nice touch too.</li>
    <li> We love the Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror! My hubby uses it to shave, my 6 year old son uses it to pretend to shave and I use it to make sure I washed off all of my facewash before leaving the shower! Many uses, great product, highly reccomend!</li>
    <li> After a decade or more of mirror after mirror that claims to be fogless, all being a miserable failure, the ToiletTree guys finally nailed it. It&#x27;s been firmly mounted in my shower since Christmas morning and not going anywhere! My previous OXO one would fall down seconds after putting it up. It was a constant battle with that mirror during shaving. Now, with the ToiletTree mirror I don&#x27;t fear for multiple broken toes every morning.</li>
    <li> The top reviewer for this product says it all and then some. One suggestion I have would be that when you are picking a place to mount this in your shower take into consideration water splashing on the mirror. I wish I had mounted mine a little farther from the shower spout. I don&#x27;t think the LED light is very effective; maybe this is because the ambient light in my show drowns it out, but this light is at my back and I could benefit from more light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After one year the mirror has clouded up. This is not on the surface of the mirror and it is bad enough to really impair its usefulness, so I am downgrading from 5 stars to 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Started shaving in the shower nearly 20 years ago and it is MUCH easier with a mirror, especially since I also shave my head for the past 2 years. Having used different mirrors I was happy to find one that has really cured the fog issue. Size and design are nice, good little squeegee and ledge, light leaves room for desire: does not shine on the face enough without leaning in on it.&lt;br /&gt;Quality is a 5, just needs better lighting.&lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise: on the off chance that you do not shave every day or you are going to be out of town for a stretch, I suggest that you empty the reservoir after every shave.</li>
    <li> It works exactly as advertised.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is the silicon adhesive was (apparantly) so old that it had hardend at the bottom of the tube and I could not get all of it out.  I tried everything up to a rolling pin, but to no avail.  The instructions tell you to use the whole tube so I had to go to Lowes and get the same stuff to make up for the difference.  No biggie, but in the future, either send a bigger tube or or don&#x27;t sent silicon that was produced before Nixon resigned.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror to hang in my shower.  I followed the directions, but after the second day the mirror came loose from the tiles.  I then held the mirror with one hand and shaved with the other hand, all the time with the shower getting the mirror steaming up.  I think it is a good idea,  but you might want to find a better way to secure it to the shower wall.</li>
    <li> After going through several different mirrors. This one is finally the one.  The ability to fill it with warm water keep the mirror fog free. Also, the ability to silicone it to the wall is perfect. No more stupid suction cups and hurt toes by it falling off.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. My old &#x27;fogless&#x27; never lived up to its name but once I read the description and how this one works, I was sold. The only thing I would change about it is the adhesive. I&#x27;d rather just have suction cups so I can reposition the mirror at will.</li>
    <li> Have had two other models...This is by far the best!  No fogging at all...I have had to add two &amp;#34;hooks&amp;#34; from which to hang our razors..</li>
    <li> I have used this mirror in my shower for over a year now and it works great. It holds to the wall with the adhesive that comes with the package and does not fog up.</li>
    <li> I really liked this mirror.  What I didn&#x27;t realize is you stick it against the wall using adhesive and silicone.  About 3 months after I bought it the mirror came crashing down and a piece broke off rendering the mirror not very useful.  The silicone was still stuck to the wall and came off easily, but definitely not worth the price.  I expected a better product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The President of the company was very responsive and did everything he could to make this situation right.  Buy with confidence from this seller!!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror hoping that it would be enough light to shave in the shower (have shaved in the shower for years).  I am very disappointed in how this product DOESN&#x27;T light up my face to shave.  You can&#x27;t even tell that the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is on when you are shaving.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
    <li> Product works well enough.  The enclosed silicone adhesive discolored white cultured marble with yellowing.  I have scrubbed with every known chemical to man without any luck to get it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery door fasteners are weak and impossible to rotate correctly.  If you buy one you will see what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The de-fogging function and light work well.  The manufacturer really needs to incorporate heavy duty suction cups in 3 to 4 places and redesign the battery door to make this item a winner.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the hubby who thought it would be nice to shave in the shower. He had no problem mounting it to the tile wall and enjoys being able to shave in the shower. Before buying it, I told him about previous reviews where some didn&#x27;t like having to refill the water behind the mirror and did he think that would be a &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34;. He said, &amp;#34;No&amp;#34; and has no issue with having to do that to have a fogless mirror. So far, he&#x27;s very pleased!!</li>
    <li> On the Plus side, the adhesive and fogless aspects work very well. The customer telephone support was also timely and apparently American based. The LED lighting is not as good as my last one, which was purchased several years ago and unfortunately left in a hotel; some illegal alien is probably enjoying it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three AA batteries will last a reasonable length of time (weeks) so long as you remember to empty the water bin promptly after each use. My experience over several months is that the batteries will be drained if you forget to empty the water tank even if you remember to turn off the light between uses; the battery compartment appears dry even when the tank is left filled. I recommend that the unit be modified to include a light timer (auto off after a few minutes) and a reminder to empty the water tank. A lesser number of higher intensity LEDs would probably do a better job of lighting your face.</li>
    <li> This would have been a GREAT product if the lighting would have lasted more than 2 months, which began to flicker then failed completely. We purchased the deluxe version especially for the lighting so were disappointed at the early failure. Adhesive is strong and filling it with hot water indeed keeps it fog free.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made of the worlds worst quality plastic.  It looks and functions more like a $5 product than the almost $50 I was charged.  Even the glass is plastic.  It also does not work at all, fogs up all the time despite the anti fog features.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product It never fogs up and I can see my whole head in the mirror. it works perfect No complaints</li>
    <li> We have had several shower mirrors over the years, and this by far is one of the best ones. It is sturdy, works well and easy to put up. I did not use the adhesive strips that came with the product though. I went to the hardware store and purchased strips of plastic velcro with adhesive on the back. It holds more weight and to me, secured the product better than what it was packaged with. What came with the product could very well work, but I have had several mirrors fall due to poor adhesive, so just did not want to take the chance. The squeegie is handy as is the light (two levels of brightness) and the mirror does not fog. I really like the light - I seldom turn on my bathroom light when showering - the light on the mirror is sufficient. Note: Mirror must be filled with warm water when you shower, in order for the mirror to not fog. It is not a big deal - fill at the beginning of your shower and empty when you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> When I stumbled across this mirror on amazon, I questioned the value of the item at the price offered.  Having been discouraged by the dozen or so mirrors I had previously purchased that either spotted, fogged despite claims to the otherwise, and/or didn&#x27;t age well, I thought what the heck.... one more isn&#x27;t going to break me.  To my surprise, it&#x27;s the best mirror I have ever used to shave in the shower; always clear, well light (2 settings powered by battery) and well sealed with the glue that comes with it, its value exceeds its price.  I think I may have found the last mirror I&#x27;ll search for in fogless shower mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/21/15.  I&#x27;m still using this unit and it&#x27;s still working like clockwork. I noticed the batteries were not lasting as long so I called the company. Three days later I had a new unit at my door. Outstanding customer service!!</li>
    <li> The light doesn&#x27;t do much unless your cheek is right up against the mirror.  However, the mirror works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the unit to function properly, you need to fill the reservoir with fresh hot water.  I found that the silicone adhesive couldn&#x27;t hold up to the needed daily usage... It fell once, and I solved that problem with gorilla glue.  Problem solved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item does what I need it to.</li>
    <li> This product is a must buy!!  Shaving has never been easier.. I shave every single day because my facial hair grows back very fast.  I used to shave after showering outside the shower and constantly cut myself, got a lot of razor burn, irritation, etc.. I switched to shaving in the shower but used to hold a small mirror which was a pain to do.  The Fogless shower mirror is a life saver.. It really does work and so much easier than holding a mirror while shaving.. It&#x27;s very easy to use. I had the original one for 2 years and just got the new led version.  such a great product and a great idea. Looking forward to all of their future products.  it&#x27;s a perfect gift and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great quality and truly fog-free!  Buy it and you won&#x27;t be sorry.  Only thing I wish was different is the squeegee is a little hard to use, but don&#x27;t let that stop you.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. Works as advertised. Absolutely fog less. Love it so much Thai I had to purchase a travel model for my travel bag. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> made a great gift he uses it everyday worth the pprice  easy way to shop&lt;br /&gt;would do it again yes</li>
    <li> I like this product and think all the other good reviews which helped me to choose it are accurate. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This appears to be a good mirror for my husband to use when he wants to shave in the shower. Larger mirror than you usually find and it is nice that it tilts so you can find the perfect view. However, I only gave it a 3 star rating because the silicone adhesive that came with it had dried up inside the tube and we had to go purchase another tube of silicone.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great. I wake up at 4am for work every morning and have to shower with little light so I don&#x27;t wake up the wifey. It has been a pain trying to use my old shower mirror. This was is big, clear and the LED lighting is awesome. I didn&#x27;t want to spend the high price at first, but it&#x27;s been worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  He likes to shave in the shower and this is perfect.  Don&#x27;t forget to fill the mirror with hot shower water first. If you don&#x27;t, it will fog.</li>
    <li> Awesome product....even better than expected.  A must for anyone who likes to shave while in the shower to save your face and time.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with my mirror and email the customer service department. I got an email back within 5 minutes and the issue was solved by Steve Parisi. He is a very nice and professional individual with great customer service. This product works fantastic and I could not be more happy.&lt;br /&gt;David from Tucson Arizona</li>
    <li> I agree with all the positive reviews for this product, but I wanted to chime in regarding the LED light. When I was trying to decide between this Deluxe version for $20 more versus the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; version, many people questioned whether or not the LED light was necessary. I went with the LED light, and I&#x27;m glad that I did. While my shower has enough light to use the product without the light turned on, using the light makes shaving even easier. The added brightness helps quite a bit. If you can affod the extra $20, and don&#x27;t have a light directly in your shower, I think you should go for the light.</li>
    <li> Due to the heavy weight of this mirror when the reservoir is filled with water, the mirror must be attached to the wall with glue (which is included in the box). Suction cups alone are not strong enough to hold the mirror. This was not a problem for me, but some people may not prefer this kind of &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; installation. The mirror works as described, when the reservoir if filled with hot water, the mirror does not fog. The lights are helpful, but not as bright as I was hoping they would be. I really like the mirror,  I was unable to give it five stars based on value as it was expensive (~$50).</li>
    <li> 100% fog free.  Mount seems good and solid.  I now shave my head &amp; face in the shower. I expect this to last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great mirror.  Fill it up and squeegy the mirror.  Worth it if you like to shave in the shower.  Light is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bang for the buck. nice and works great no issues at all.</li>
    <li> Works great, ingenious. Disappointed in the light though. It does what it claimed, \\&quot;illuminates the entire mirror surface\\&quot; but unless you are within 1 or 2 inches of it, it won&#x27;t illuminate your face at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, it&#x27;s been months since I purchased this and have used it daily since. It is very functional except for the light which as previously noted I don&#x27;t use at all. With a secondary light source it works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;  I typically get almost a steam shower going and once this mirror is filled with warm water and squeegeed off I have a perfectly clear shaving mirror in a nice steamy shower, which is optimum for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;  One thing I don&#x27;t know if intended in the design, is that the mirror itself distorts a little after a few uses with hot water so that at close up it magnifies similar to a concave shaving mirror. At first I did not like this aspect but now,after  frankly , it makes it better especially as my old eyes are not as sharp as they were.  Buy this mirror, or better still save 20 bucks and buy it&#x27;s non lit version.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the LED shower mirror. I use it daily in my large open shower and I don&#x27;t even have to fill it with water to prevent fogging. The razor shelf is a nice feature. It would be nice if the LEDs had an auto off function. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The mirror is as advertised, but it protrudes quite a way out from the wall--way too far for my taste</li>
    <li> Strong stable mirror will not fog and has place for razor. LED light is good. Would recommend to buyers. Quality</li>
    <li> I am a big online shopper and I always leave a comment (recommendation) either good or bad for the products that I have purchased.  When I read the information on the Fogless Mirror from ToiletTree Products I thought that I had finally found the ultimate fogless mirror for my shower.  I bought the lighted mirror because I often shower early and need the light when I shave.  Well, when the mirror arrived I opened the box and was thrilled with what I saw.  I immediately jumped into the shower and installed the mirror using the included gel and tape that came with the mirror.  I had some difficulty squeezing out the gel from the tube as it was stuck inside. I was not able to get all of the gel out of the tube but I went ahead and installed the mirror with the amount of gel I managed to squeeze out.  This was a mistake and I should not have installed the mirror with the small amount I was able to squeeze out of the tube.  Unfortunately, the next day the mirror fell to the shower floor. I decided to call ToiletTree Products and spoke with Kelly who is one of the owners.  Kelly could not have been nicer on the phone and she sent me two additional tubes of the gel, and she explained to me that it is very important to use all of the adhesive gel so that the mirror would be secure and NEVER fall off the wall in the shower.  Two days later the package arrived and I was able to squeeze out all the gel and installed the mirror once again. The mirror is firmly secured now and I can tell that it will never fall again. This is undoubtedly the best fogless mirror I have owned, and I have had many. The customer service at ToiletTree Products is fantastic. I could not be more delighted with my purchase and you will be too if you buy this lighted mirror from ToiletTree Products.  I should add that Kelly also sent me a personal note along with a small gift.  The note read... I have sent you this gift for any inconvenience you were caused due to the mirror falling from the shower wall.Just the note alone showed me how much ToiletTree Products cares about their customers. This company provides a great product and is a real class act!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter</li>
    <li> Great product, however, I don&#x27;t remember reading in the description that it was necessary to fill the resevoir in the back of the mirror to make it fogless.  This means that each time my husband uses it he has to slip it off it&#x27;s \\&quot;mooring\\&quot;, fill it up, slip it back on &amp; then when he&#x27;s done, slip it off &amp; empty it.  However, that being said, it really is fogless &amp; is very secure w/the included silicone adhesive. Would purchase again, but, if you are/have a husband/man that leaves dirty clothes on the floor, more than likely you will not fill the resevoir and you will not like.</li>
    <li> Well lit, large size allows for easy shaving, comes with a squeegee to wipe away water spots, looks nice in the shower.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband, and it works better than any of the others that he has had.  It is made much better than any I have seen, and does what it says it will do.  Perfect mirror size, is fogless as it says, and light works well.  Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Great for the man who likes to shave in the shower. My husband absolutely loves this, Works great, No fog mirror and it lights up!</li>
    <li> Bought as Christmas gift for my brother.  He loves it and has tried other brands and doesn&#x27;t work as well as this one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now.  As long as you put warm to hot water in the back of the mirror it is perfect!  Glad I brought this one instead of the others because it can&#x27;t get any better it is crystal clear.</li>
    <li> This product has fulfilled all of my expectations.  It is well-made and attaches to the shower surface easily.  It is completely fogless when filled with hot shower water.  The lighted feature provides ample lighting from all angles and makes shaving your head/face a simple task.  I highly recommend it to any other customers.</li>
    <li> The shower softens the hairs and shaving becomes smooth and easy.  I have loved this little thing and it will be in my house from now on.</li>
    <li> The fogless aspect of the mirror works perfect and the larger size is also nice compared to the non-deluxe model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I bought this one for better lighting while shaving and I&#x27;m not completely satisfied with the light it provides but it is better than nothing.  I think I would need aimable spotlights to get the effect I want.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product and it is sad to see that marketers / manufacturers do not know what poor taste is. Here is the scoop: On the center of the mirror, it says in black letters the brand which, in part, contains the word &amp;#34;toilet&amp;#34;. So, you are in the shower, getting clean presumably, and the word TOILET in staring at you while you are in the shower.  FAIL! it is the equivalent to someone putting a non-removable logo on a bathroom mirror! Oh, wait . . . LORD!!!! THIS IS A BATHROOM MIRROR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make this a sticker or make it gone!</li>
    <li> Even better than the advertisement - a great set up if you like to shave and floss in the shower.  Nothing better!</li>
    <li> Disappointed that when filled with water, the &#x27;weight&#x27; of it pushes out the plastic mirror, deforming the image.  The smaller one that this replaced when I moved didn&#x27;t have this problem.  I kind of regret not just ordering the same thing I had and which worked for less money.  They really should have used thicker &#x27;mirror&#x27; plastic so this wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem.</li>
    <li> If you use warm water, it definitely won&#x27;t fog.  Included squeegee works well to clear water/spots.  Main reason I got this one was for the LED lighting b/c I don&#x27;t have good lighting in my shower...it&#x27;s nice and bright and allows me to see the details as I trim around my beard.</li>
    <li> Worked great until the adhesive failed and it dropped.</li>
    <li> this was a definite upgrade from my previous mirror .the squeegee and the razor shelf are excellent ideas  . the LED&#x27;s are bright and the mirror is very good  . the mirror seems more like a real mirror instead of a fake reflective film like some  of these type  products have  . my only concern is the adhesive  in case I need to take the mirror down one day  , it doesn&#x27;t seem as it&#x27;ll be easy to remove and there were no specific instructions on how to do so  ,</li>
    <li> -UPDATE 8/26/13-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review is below the dotted line, in which I originally gave this item a two star rating due to some issues I had. I am happy to report that the company quickly resolved my issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue that led to my review was that the adhesive that came with the product would not work for me, which led me to use super glue to hold the mirror up.  The glue failed and the mirror fell, breaking my razor. The president of the company responded to my review and apologized and let me know that he wanted to help. I ended up receiving a new bracket with two tubes of adhesive and two pieces of sticky tape. I used the materials and got the mirror two stick.  It&#x27;s sticking to the wall like a rock actually, which is now making me wonder if I did something wrong the first time. I wonder if I didn&#x27;t peel the cover of BOTH sides of the tape, which resulted in the bracket not sticking to the wall while the adhesive dried. If so, that&#x27;s quite embarrassing and not the fault of the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also mentioned below that the pivoting mechanism seemed rather flimsy, and I&#x27;m happy to say that this replacement they sent me seems much sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, now that the mirror is in place, I enjoy it quite a bit.  I went over what I like about it in the older review below the dotted line, but I&#x27;ll rattle them off again in a list here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Nice and large viewing area.&lt;br /&gt;2) Stays completely fog-free as advertised.  And this is the most important feature.&lt;br /&gt;3) It has a shelf for my razor.&lt;br /&gt;4) It has LED lights that do an adequate job of lighting up my face.&lt;br /&gt;5) It has a squeegee for cleaning water droplets off the mirror. Very handy to have.&lt;br /&gt;6) It&#x27;s sticking to the wall VERY securely. This thing is not falling anytime soon, if ever.&lt;br /&gt;7) Toilettree Products really does a good job listening to their customers, and are VERY quick about fixing any issues.  A+ customer support!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let me list off some things that could be improved:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) While the shelf is nice, it should be bigger.  It&#x27;s kinda small, at least for my Gillette ProGlide 3-in-1 Styler monstrosity thing. It should have some kind of lip around the edge to minimize the risk of your razor falling off. Also a holder for a can of shaving cream would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;2) Plastics feel too cheap for the price tag. This thing is pricey, and I feel that the materials it&#x27;s made out of should reflect that. Maybe it should have a nice rubberized shelf so your razor won&#x27;t slide around on it or soft touch surfaces around the edges for when you pick the mirror up to fill it with water.  Some metal pieces incorporated into the design would be nice as well.  It just needs something that shows/feels premium since this item carries a premium price tag.&lt;br /&gt;3) The difference between the brightness settings for the LED lights is minimal.  Like I said below, I had a hard time telling the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as you can see, the positives far outweigh the negatives.  This is a very smart idea that works, and has a company behind it that actually has quality customer support. Now I just have to see how this holds up over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this mirror to anyone. As this company strives to improve their product, I can&#x27;t wait to see what they will do next.  Good job guys and gals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-ORIGINAL REVIEW-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought the cheaper non-lit version of this mirror a while back. It said that it was impossible for this mirror to fog up; and the claim was completely accurate. When filled with water, the mirror stayed clear for the entire duration of my shower. And the mirror was a generous size which is always nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after about 3-4 months, I noticed that the mirrored surface was starting to erode away at the corners from the inside, and everytime I dumped the water out, little black flecks of stuff would fall out and go down the drain. I admit that I would leave the water in the mirror instead of dumping it out right away, so maybe that had something to do with the erosion, but still that is not an excuse for the degradation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I noticed that there was a \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; LED-lit model of the mirror, and I bought it about 2-3 weeks ago thinking I would make sure to dump the water out right away to perhaps prevent the mirrored surface from eroding away again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the mirror, and was surprised to see it was even bigger than the first mirror, which was really nice. Then I tried to use the included adhesive to stick the mirror to the shower wall, and it wouldn&#x27;t stick. It kept sliding down no matter how long I held it on the wall for. I never had this issue with the first mirror.  So I eventually gave up and used super glue to stick it to the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the first time I filled the reservoir with water, it started leaking from FOUR(!) separate spots on the bottom. All the water would leak out within 1 minute.  Also, the product was supposed to have two brightness settings for the LED lights, but this one only had one setting. It would only turn them on and then off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company and promptly received a replacement mirror. I filled it with water and it did not leak.  It also had the two brightness setting as described, although the difference between the brightness setting was so minimal I spent a good five minutes trying to determine if there was really any difference at all between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shelf on this model was the same size as the first mirror I had, but because the mirror itself was bigger, it was harder to reach the shelf to put my razor on. But this wasn&#x27;t a big issue to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting mechanism on this model also seemed VERY flimsy, unlike the first mirror I had. I filled the mirror with water and used the included squeegee (nice touch) to clean the water droplets off the mirrored surface. In doing so, the mirror pivoted down from the position I wanted it in so I had to readjust the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this morning, the mirror fell off the wall (remember I used super glue because the included adhesive wouldn&#x27;t work for me)and broke my razor. The pivoting mechanism completely separated from the mirror, although I may be able to put it back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty ticked about the issues I&#x27;ve had with this mirror, partly due to the price of it.  This is a LOT of money for a shower mirror.  The concept is genius, but the build quality is not representative of the price tag.  You are paying for the idea of it; not the quality. Such a shame.e mirrored surface was starting to erode away at the corners from the inside, and everytime I dumped the water out, little black flecks of stuff would fall out and go down the drain.

    <li> I ordered this mirror for my husband who shaves in the shower (heavy beard).  Anyway, it went together quickly, and works perfectly.  I asked him to rate it, and he said &amp;#34;Give it five stars!&amp;#34;.  It doesn&#x27;t fog up like the one it replaced because you fill the back of it with water.  When I asked my husband if he thought that the filling and emptying was a nuisance, he said, &amp;#34;not in the least.&amp;#34;  As for the lighting, it also is perfect.  His old mirror lit from the bottom and would shut off after an allotted amount of time.  This mirror lights completely around its perimeter giving the user better lighting, and the switch is manual.  The user just shuts it off when finished.  So, all that said, my husband recommends this mirror for anyone who needs a mirror in the shower.  NOTE: One reviewer remarked on the width vs. height, stating that the mirror should be taller rather than wider.  My husband finds the dimensions perfect.  After thinking on it myself, I can see that the height issue might be important for a man who shaves his head.  Still, the mirror tilts and should accommodate that issue as well.  In any case, I don&#x27;t believe anyone who orders this mirror will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a year ago, and have loved it from the very 1st.  Its a great product at a reasonable price.  So why am I leaving a review now after a year.  Well unfortunately about a week or so ago the led lights stopped working.  And of course I&#x27;m just out of my warranty period (it ended 1 month ago).  Just for kicks I sent an email to Toilettree and well boy was I surprised.  Within minutes of having sent the email I received a reply and the reply was try new batteries (which I had already done), if that doesn&#x27;t fix the problem they would send me a new one.  No questions asked.  And yes I did mention in my original email that I was out of the warranty period.  So to sum up its a great product/makes shaving in the shower easy to do.  And perhaps even better than the product is the customer service.</li>
    <li> I have had the standard version of this mirror for about six months. I bought this version because it is a little dark where I mounted the first mirror. (I was able to use the same mount for this Deluxe version.) I am somewhat disappointed because I don&#x27;t find that the light is bright enough on my face to make much difference. Moreover, it bizarrely has a low setting which means that to turn the light off you have to push the button twice. The larger size of the mirror is of no benefit to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love shaving in the shower and these mirrors stay free of fog. I recommend buying the standard version and trying to mount it somewhere where the light is decent. Also, if you mount it close to the shower head (so that you can since the razor) you will get more water drops on the mirror, which may leave deposits when the water evaporates. They are pretty easily cleaned though.</li>
    <li> The mount eventually fell off my bathroom wall after about 6 months of use.    11/04/14 Update - Company reached out to me regarding my issue and will resend the mounting kit, changing my rating to 5 stars, excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> If you have a hard time shaving like a regular person that does not have sensitive skin, this might be a good solution for you that shaves while showering. Easy setup (read the instructions) and very functional system to avoid mirror fog. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d actually call it fogless, but I don&#x27;t think there really is such a thing. To make it fogless, one has to fill it with warm water. At that point, it becomes a carnival mirror and distorts your face. The light makes it even harder to see yourself, believe it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that, I really do like this mirror. It&#x27;s large, easily removed from the base to wash off the fog, and gets the job done. It also seals to the wall very well with the provided silicone.</li>
    <li> After about 20 days the LED&#x27;s stopped working all together, I tried replacing the batteries/cleaned the inside, setting it out of the shower in hopes it would dry out, nothing fixed the LED lights. As for the fogless mirror part it works very well, Id give it a 5 start in a heart beat if it wasn&#x27;t for the LED&#x27;s going out in less than a month.</li>
    <li> The concept is good, and the mirror works fog free as advertised but after 6 months of use the adjustable brackets that allow you to position the mirror can no longer support the weigh of the water. My mirror now points towards the floor and won&#x27;t prop up unless I put something behind it to support it.  Very frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - I was contacted by the company president shortly after posting this and he had a replacement bracket sent out.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the item and more so with the customer service.  Why is this still a two star rating?  I know there are people who only read the negative reviews, and I think it&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;m satisfied.  I&#x27;d give it a 4 or 5 star otherwise.</li>
    <li> Truly &amp;#34;Fogless&amp;#34;  &amp; the light is bright, The shelf is realy handy as well!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Won&#x27;t waste the money. Also it is made in China, would like to see more USA products even if they cost more.</li>
    <li> easy to install and worked perfectly</li>
    <li> It actually works!!!! Without water the mirror fogs completely, as expected.  When the unit is filled with warm water --- no fog.  Great.  I would like added is a clock / date display.  Otherwise, great unit.</li>
    <li> I have gone through 3 suposed fog less mirrors over the past few years. Each and every one fogged up almost immediately. Not this one. Perfectly clear no matter how hot the shower is. Light also works great. Finally a fog less mirror that works!! Thanks.</li>
    <li> this mirror would be amazing if it wasn&#x27;t so bulky.  the mirror is way too large for a shower and it the bracket is rather large so the whole thing sticks out from the wall about 2 - 2.5 inches which to me is a lot!  I&#x27;m sending it back without even trying it out.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this mirror for my husband in December 2011.  The mirror has worked great and I have enjoyed using it as well because I could pivot the mirror down for my height. Unfortunately for the past several months, when water is added to prevent the mirror from fogging up, the tilt hinge no longer can hold the mirror up.  So know the mirror faces downward making it impossible to use if water is added. Given the price I certainly would have hoped it would work for more than two years.  I recently purchased another Pivoting Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror for my sister, hopefully that one will last longer.</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews, this seemed like the perfect shower mirror.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not much of a mirror at all.  The best I can describe it is looking into a very shiny surface... you see your reflection, but not nearly good enough to accurately shave.  I had already installed it so I decided to not go through the trouble of taking it down... but less than 2 months later, it fell down on its own and broke into several pieces.  Oh well... $40 wasted.  I’ m writing this review so you can keep your $40… hopefully this saves you from some frustration.</li>
    <li> Very useful product, arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now and the light has already burnt out on the second setting. I REALLY like the concept of using a mirror in the shower and having a light. The way the water doesn&#x27;t made the mirror fog is great. I just wish it would have lasted longer!!!</li>
    <li> The product  works okay but for $50 I expected something that required less routine upkeep.  For every use you have to take it off the wall before your shower, fill it with hot water, place it back on the wall, use the squeegee a couple of times during the shower, then empty it and wipe it down at the end.  If you don&#x27;t perform every step every time it is useless.  I neglected to wipe it dry after one shower and it was covered in water spots.  Since the mirror already has batteries it seems that they could be utilized to heat the mirror.  The hot water routine seems so low tech.  If it had cost $15 then I wouldn&#x27;t complain but this is advertised as if it is the most modern, deluxe product on the market.  It is not.  I like the fact that it does not use suction cups so it definitely will not fall off the wall.  On the other hand, I don&#x27;t expect this product to last over a year.  When it is no longer useful it will still be permanently attached to my ceramic tile.  If I realized this earlier I would not have mounted it.</li>
    <li> Bought this Deluxe LED mirror in March 2012. Used it for four months. Mirror works as advertized and remains fog free, however the lights no longer work. I would recommend not buying the LED mirror.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery but I am a bit disappointed due to the fact it didnt meet my expectations.  I think its a cheap product and I can get a better shave with a pocket sized mirror.  Fogless mirror, ha.. you have to put hot water in the mirror for it to be fogless.  Waste of time, Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Bought this after returning a \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror that fogged even before i turned the shower on. This thing just works, no fog ever, the light is great, and the squeegee squeegees! I&#x27;ve also had this for 6 months now and I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE... The pivoting hinge no longer holds the mirror (full or empty) in an upright position, it falls to the bottom position. I now have to wedge something behind it to angle it up when I shave. Other than that, I still like it.</li>
    <li> The mirror has been in use for about 8 months now. Initially, it was the best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned. Worked just as advertised and I was very happy. Then after 3-4 months of use, the swivel in the back started to get worn out. Now, it&#x27;s worn to the point that it doesn&#x27;t even hold the mirror upright when the water reservoir is filled. I have to put a sponge behind the mirror to keep it upright. Also, the compartment which held the batteries leaked about 5 months in (and yes, I made sure the cover was LOCKED). Opened the compartment one day and found the batteries corroded by moisture. Great concept but falls a little short of expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company contacted me wanting to replace the swivel mount. They sent me a new one but again, a few months later it began to wear down and lost its functionality. Good customer service.</li>
    <li> I followed all of the directions exept for one...  It was physically impossible to get more than 40-50% of the adhesive out of the tube and it wasn&#x27;t for lack of effort. I am a 34 year old,  220 lb. man. I went and got a pliers and eventually stood on the little tube, balancing on the heel of one foot...  That stuff was not coming out of there. Apparently it had cured in the tube while it sat in the warehouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to stick the mirror up there with what would come out of the tube and the next day (today)  it made it about 5 minutes into my shower before falling.  At least it didn&#x27;t break. I&#x27;ll try getting more adhesive from the company or maybe try crazy glue...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the five minutes it was on the wall it did work like a charm though.  No fog; clear view.  The light was nice and the little squeegee worked well too.</li>
    <li> Just received delivery.  One of the two plastic knobs used to access the battery compartment is broken.  This means that water may leak into the battery are and break the device.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and before people start bashing my review, please understand that 1) I will not respond to idiotic trollish comments and 2) These are called \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; for a reason and i am entitled to my opinion and judgment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is a great product. Works flawlessly, great build quality, great packaging and from my research, a great customer service department. I have used this mirror for a few weeks now and have taken a star each for the following 2 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The LED lights do not really work or enhance anything. Reminds me of a \\&quot;light up\\&quot; license place bracket that you see on cars, gives it a cosmetic appeal but no real benefits. I wish the designers had tested it out on consumers as the LED lights would have worked better if they were focused out instead of focused in towards the mirror. All the lights do is give the mirror somewhat of a \\&quot;Halo\\&quot; effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Charging almost $50.00 for adding a few LED lights (that do not help) that cost pennies and a slightly larger surface area is absurd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have the time or patience to return this and order a non LED mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, i would definitely go with the non LED version of this product as it works as advertised and is a great product. Just avoid this LED version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---6 MONTH UPDATE---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 6 months down the line, this $50.00 mirror definitely does stay fog free as advertised BUT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - One of the LED light has failed&lt;br /&gt;2 - The locking mechanism that positions the mirror assembly cannot hold the weight and hence keeps on slipping to a tilted position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there a lifetime warranty on this thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 12/2/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the product was out of its warranty period, the company reached out to me and mailed me a brand new mirror without any hassle or payment. This alone deserves 5 stars. Only time will tell how long this replacement will last but the build seems solid and the hinge problem has been fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Steve for following up with your customers. A good product with great customer service is what the market lags and your company is definitely on the better end of the spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!last but the build seems solid and the hinge problem has been fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Steve for following up with your customers. A good product with great customer service is what the market lags and your company is definitely on the better end of the spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
    <li> After the company offered me a replacing part now it works much better and the customer service from this company is great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror in June and it was the fourth shower mirror I had tried over the last 10 years or so and I loved it. Big mirror, stuck firmly on the wall of my shower, light, and no fog. What is not to love? Until today. Today, the mirror&#x27;s tilt mechanism quit holding the mirror at the angle I need when filled with water. It is like the tilt mechanism had just worn out and now the mirror just tilts down all the way when filled with water. I see by other reviews that this is a common problem. I am going to try to find some kind of shim to place behind the tilt mechanism (my wife suggested a large plastic suction cup) and hopefully I can find something that is the correct thickness for the angle I need, as I installed the mirror just a little too high in my shower and I need the mirror to tilt down just a click.</li>
    <li> My husband really wanted one of these so I bought this as an anniversary gift for him. He was really excited to receive it. He read the instructions and hung it. To our dismay it fell within 24 hours of being hung and broke. So my husband never even got to use it.</li>
    <li> I love it. I placed mine on a tray on the floor to ceiling stan. The lights work ok. I don&#x27;t use it because I have  a light in my shower.</li>
    <li> **Update 1/8/2014** I thought with the comment from Steve Parisi in response to my review was unbelievable customer service. Turns out I was right, I shouldn&#x27;t have believed it. It makes him and the company look great, but its clearly just a PR thing. As Mr. Parisi requested I sent them my information along with a copy of the reply from Mr. Parisi on December 3rd. It&#x27;s over a month later, and I have no replacement parts as promised. This took a 3 star review of a very good product down to a 1 star review for terrible terrible service. I personally plan on staying away from ToiletTree products from now on.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review - Unfortunately this mirror is not durable. While it works great it does not last. I&#x27;ve had the mirror for just over a year and the light hasn&#x27;t worked for about the last six months. Luckily the light is not the selling point for me, I bought it for the size. The other issue, and the major failure is the pivoting feature wears out over time. It&#x27;s unable to support the weight of the mirror filled with water any long and it constantly falls to the lowest rung leaving the mirror facing the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it worked I loved it, unfortunately its durability makes me question the price tag.</li>
    <li> Great product works well.&lt;br /&gt;the anchoring system is the best! No worries of it falling off the wall like the others I&#x27;ve bought</li>
    <li> Does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;Light is not real bright.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic mirror will collect mineral deposits that will not come off.&lt;br /&gt;Does stay fogless if used properly and has stayed glued to shower for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;Nice little inexpensive mirror.</li>
    <li> Very nice, compact design, yet large enough to see my entire face. The adjustable tilt is great. Much better than any of the other shower mirrors I&#x27;ve bought in the past. I&#x27;d recommend this product to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> I think this product works pretty good ive had no issues with it yet . My only concern is that its held onto the wall with silicone i&#x27;m just not sure how long it will be before it falls off onto the tub floor and shatters. Although I&#x27;m sure this could be resolved if you drilled a screw thru the tile I just havent had the motivation to do it. Overall pretty satisfied its been about two months no issues works well.</li>
    <li> Good Points: Looks like Ad. Hangs properly. Does not fog. Simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;Bad Points: Design flaws. Does have some \\&quot;Fun-House Mirror\\&quot; effect because the mirror is thin plastic. Mirror gets covered in water droplets to the point that you have to splash water on it to see yourself again. Squeegee is of moderate use.  Whole mirrored unit sticks out several inches from the wall.  Mirror lights are of zero use in a normally lit bathroom - but OK if showering in the dark. Tip: Hang right at eye level (or a tiny bit lower) if possible. Hang too high, tilting down: Mirror will bulge, giving fish-eye effect.  Hang too low, tilting upward: Mirror will center-decompress, giving satellite-dish effect. Remember: The water&#x27;s weight dominates the mirror. Overall: Product is OK, but wait for a sale - product is not worth $50.  I considered sending it back, but part of the unit was already stuck to the shower wall - so I kept it.  I had higher hopes for this product.  :(</li>
    <li> This mirror seemed like a great thing from the reviews, and I was excited to install it.  But the mirror is made of plastic (which I assume is necessary to allow the hot shower water to warm it up to prevent fogging), and I was quite disappointed with the image.  The reflection distorts your face and makes it look SMALLER, which is the opposite of what you want to shave with.  The other disappointment is the the LED lights are woefully inadequate.  If your face is three inches away from the mirror, a little light shines on it, but any further and there&#x27;s no light at all.  I find standing that close the the mirror claustrophobic and annoying.  On the plus side, it has a nice-looking frame, a large (albeit distorted) mirror, and a well-designed shelf and mounting bracket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning this mirror and going back to my cheap glass mirror that I let soak in the shower water, squeegee off, and set on a shelf to shave with.</li>
    <li> The mirror requires that you empty a tube of silicone caulk on your shower wall to install the mirror&#x27;s mount.  Each time you want to use the mirror you have to clean the mirror and fill it with hot water.  If you forget to empty the mirror you have to pour cold water out on the floor next time you use fill the mirror. Good quality material but inconvenient design.</li>
    <li> The concept itself is great. I just got mine and it worked great for keeping the fog off the mirror, 30mins with increase in temp and no build up. BUT here is the problem!! I bought this as a mirror and the mirror on this item is terrible!! Its one of those warped ones that make your face look small in the middle and big everywhere else. When looking into it, you can see the edges of the wall behind you start out in the top corner of the mirror then move far into the middle of the mirror and then back out at the bottom corner of the mirror. I dont know if this on purpose so people look thinner or maybe I got a bad one?? But I hate it!! I have to get my face very close to see where I&#x27;m shaving without everything being distorted. For the price paid for this item I would think it would have a good realistic mirror in it.&lt;br /&gt;So all in all the design is great, but the mirror itself is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;I must say customer service is AWESOME with this company!!! After posting my review is was contacted within a day or two, and they sent me a new mirror with no problem. I still think the mirror could be a bit more flat, but all in all it works great!!!!! Love this thing and very happy I found it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It does the job! Would like it be a thinner profile, and the tilt needs to be improved but I love it and will recommend to my friends!</li>
    <li> I have purchased many &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors in the past...none of them work. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are good for a month or so, but then...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one, because you fill it with warm water, actually solves the problem. Fog occurs because of the temperature difference. Without getting into a physics lesson, condensate (fog) forms on a cooler surface because, as the water in the air cools, it forms droplets, thus clouding your mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is designed that you fill with warm/hot water when getting in the shower. Because the mirror is warmed by the water, it stays of even enought temperature with the shower, that no condensate (fog) occurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great design and flawless execution. This will be my last shaving mirror.</li>
    <li> High quality and as described. It comes with the epoxy glue. No complaint so far.</li>
    <li> Have tried several in the shower mirrors and none worked until this one.  It actually does not fog up and was easy to install.</li>
    <li> This item arrived a few days before expected, which made me happy as it was going to be part of my husbands birthday gift. He has always shaved in the shower, but has never had a mirror that does not fog up or stay put on the wall until I purchased this one. It hasn&#x27;t budged after I mounted it, and so far, has never fogged up. My husband is extremely pleased with this shower mirror.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Great, wide mirror&lt;br /&gt;-quality product&lt;br /&gt;-Tool-less installation&lt;br /&gt;-Ability to permanently mount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Only rotates vertically, cannot put in corner of shower.&lt;br /&gt;-LED light is too centered&lt;br /&gt;-Light Level \\&quot;toggle\\&quot; is not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product with the added light is not preferable as the LED shines directly into your pupils during shaving. The light is also too dim over 3 feet away, making avoiding your pupils all but impossible. Also, on a side note, the toggle (low / bright) switch does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 20 dollar product (the product without the light) is much cheaper and, in my opinion, preferable as it does not have the disappointing light factors that this model has. Added value in future versions if they can make a X and Y axis rotating model to enable corner installation.</li>
    <li> Bought this shower mirror for my wife to give me at Christmas.  So far its living up to all the positive things I&#x27;d read about it.  Previously, I had a mirror fastened to the wall by suction cups.  Periodically, the suction cups let loose and the mirror fell to the floor, along with my razor.  This new one is sure to stay put.  In addition, the fact that you fill the mirror with hot water and then squeegee off the drops makes for a really clear surface throughout my shower.  I&#x27;ve had about 4 different shower mirrors over the years and this one is the best by far.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it.  It really does work and never fogs.  It&#x27;s big too which is nice.</li>
    <li> This product actually works. It does require a semi-permanent attachment to your tile or wall surface with a silicone adhesive. Not sure about removable. Make sure you test the height you want it before you attach it. But it does not fog, is large enough to shave comfortably and has a relatively distortion free viewing area. It has a shelf to hold your razor and a designed place to hang the squeegee. It sticks out from the wall about 3 inches in order for it to be able to use the tilt feature. You fill the built in container behind the mirror with hot water and there is no fog at all. I am pleasantly surprised by the quality and functionality of this product. And the shipping was amazing. I used regular amazon shipping and it was here the next day. What more can you ask, great product, good value, works just like claimed and superb service. I&#x27;m recommending it to my friends. If you shave in the shower, this product works.</li>
    <li> Go with the cheaper version. Mirror light doesn&#x27;t work properly. First order came with broken battery compound latch. Light switch for the second one stopped working after just a few months.</li>
    <li> I bought this as one of my husband&#x27;s Christmas presents as he requested a fogless shower mirror. I ended up researching each and every brand out there for HOURS before making a purchasing decision. Let me tell you, this is the ONLY product which consistently had extremely positive reviews, was confirmed to be fogless without the use of any additional sprays/products, and their customer service is excellent. We&#x27;ve had the product for 3 months now and it is still hanging beautifully in the shower, great big size, absolutely fogless, easy to maintain, LED lights are a plus. I really can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product, I am 100% happy with my purchase and my husband loves it! Glad I took the time to do my research because there are much more expensive options out there (for example, Sharper Image, etc.) that have horrible reviews and go figure, this is the best product for a great price! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This mirror was VERY simple to put together. I applied the adhesive and stuck the bracket to the shower wall, waited 24 hours and put the mirror on the bracket. It held just fine, even with the reservoir completely full. Although this version is 20% bigger than the original, it fits in my small shower quite nicely and will be very convenient for tweezing my eyebrows. As you can see from the picture it is VERY clean and clear. The only downfall is remembering to fill the reservoir with water before each use to keep it fogless, but other than that, this product is pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BEST part about the LED fogless shower mirror is the fact that my husband can now shave in the shower, and it will result in a much easier clean up. I very much dislike having to clean the sink after every shave. I enjoy the cool illumination the LED lights provide also. It tends to be a little darker in the shower since we don&#x27;t have a light directly above, so this mirror brightens it up a bit!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality.  Not exactly fogless though.</li>
    <li> Have been shaving in the shower for 15 years -- moisture in beard is the most important variable in getting a great shave. Mirror works as advertised -- does not fog, does not fall off wall. The tube of silicon was hardened when it arrived -- called the company and they immediately sent another one. As another reviewer suggested, mirror would be better with short side up, would fit face better. Also,if it had a magnifying feature, that would make it absolutely perfect. All in all, an excellent product! BTW, I use the Gillette Fusion shaver with a built-in light, from The Art of Shaving, and the following shave creams: Burts Bees, Aveda, RS (from Rite Aid), Kiss My Face. RS is the least expensive, but Rite Aid never stocks much of it.Burts Bees and Kiss My Face are reasonable, Aveda is fairly expensive. The key to good shaving with creams is to not use too much, so the razor doesn&#x27;t clog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/12/12: Mirror no longer holds its position and flops down. I have to hold it vertical with one hand and shave with the other. Called the company and they immediately agreed to send a new piece with a stronger ratchet. No argument or documentation required. Good service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/18/12: The new plastic piece arrived and easily slid into place. Mirror now works perfectly. Great service. I think over time it&#x27;s a good idea to shift the mirror&#x27;s position gently, as the plastic may wear out easily. BTW, I like the lights!</li>
    <li> Day 1: I received this item in the mail a few hours ago. Out of the box I noticed a scratch on the frame of the mirror but decided it will be forgotten in time. I followed the directions, cleaned the wall surface with soap and water, then with alcohol and waited for the surface to dry. When I tried to apply the silicon glue to the frame I realized the contents of the tube were dried up, nothing was coming out and it was completely useless. Fortunately I had some Gorilla glue and used that in combination with the sticky back tape that came in the box to attach the frame to the tiled wall. I immediately realized the plastic frame is not straight. Trying to push it down to the tile was a complete waste of time and eventually I had to settle for holding it down with some masking tape. I will remove the tape to see how well it is attached tomorrow and will share the rest of my findings then. So far, I will give it a generous 1 out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: My substitute gorilla glue has dried and I attached the mirror. After an hour run on the treadmill it was time to take a shower and give the new mirror a try. I followed the instructions, removed the mirror and filled the reservoir in the back with warm water from the shower and true to their word the mirror did not fog up once during my long hot shower! I shaved with the LED lights on and it was nice to actually see me face clearly for a change :) I had been using the same old Z&#x27;fogless mirror for a few years and it was pretty scratched up from falling and a bit tarnished from constant humidity. So, I upgrade my rating from 1 to 3 stars and will hold my final judgement until more use. I should also note that I received a very timely response to my initial post from the President of the company owning up to the problems and willing to do whatever is necessary to make things right with me. I have to admit that kind of customer service is very nice and representative of a caring company. I have a few thoughts/suggestions to make this a better product. Some of these may prove to be unnecessary after further use but here they are anyways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Better quality of glue or perhaps two tubes from different batches/suppliers in case one is dried up :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Better quality control to make sure there are no scratches on the mirror or its frame. This may be very difficult to do as I am sure they are manufactured in China and are handled by people during assembly and packing so it is impossible to avoid a few small scratches every once in a while. Having said that, for this amount of money at retail I think a perfect product is more fitting and expected. Those with tiny scratches and other small imperfections can be sold through liquidators and in other markets at lesser prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I am a bit concerned about the wear and tear of the plastic tilting mechanism over time. Using metal parts would have been worse given rusting problems but perhaps making that portion removable and replaceable would be a good idea for the next generation. Also, it is hard to remove the mirror without causing some tilting as it is sort of flimsy. Perhaps this is an area where some improvement can be made in the next version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I realize filling the reservoir with hot water is the key to keeping the mirror from fogging up but perhaps there is a better way to empty and refill the reservoir without having to remove it and having to deal with all the tilting issues and any chances of dropping and scratching the mirror. A tube with a valve at the bottom of the mirror can be used to drain the reservoir and another with a large funnel like top can be used to refill it. I realize this is a rather rudimentary approach but I am sure the designers of the product can think of more innovative approaches to tackle this challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Having batteries in any device near the shower and water and keeping them from rusting is rather challenging. We will see how well these are sealed overtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, after one use, the mirror works as advertised and the lighting is a nice useful feature. I will update my findings over time so stay tuned. Of course my wife still has to use it and she may have a thing or two to add :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2: The Gorilla glue I used to attach the mirror base to the wall has held up fine and when filled with warm water the mirror does not fog but that is all the positives I can say about it while giving myself credit for using a better grade of glue since I had no choice. Unfortunately, already the mirror can not hold the weight of the water it needs in order of it to work as advertised. This is due to the cheap plastic mechanism used to set the angle of the mirror which I do not change but gets moved everyday when I have to remove the old water and add fresh warm water. Further, the adding and emptying of water has become a time consuming pain which requires one to also wipe the water drops from the surface of the mirror. The supplied blade is also not perfect in removing the water from the surface and leaves many trails on the mirror. A better design would have used batteries and an electrical filament to heat the back of the mirror quickly even if it would have required more or separate batteries. In all, I find this mirror to be of very poor quality and am going to send it back. I only hope to be able to remove the base from the wall without breaking it or leaving a mark on the tiles. Btw, it was nice to hear back from the President of the company after my first post but there was absolutely no follow up after that. I suppose it was all for show specially since he did not even leave his email address. It is a real shame! In conclusion: \\&quot;This one belongs to the horror files\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/15/13: The President of the Company, Steve, stayed in touch with me to see how my experience was. After pointing out the deficiencies he immediately sent me an improved mirror that fixed all the issues. I have been using the new mirror for a few weeks and it is flawless. Thank you Steve for an incredible customer support, continuing to listen to your customers and improving your products. I will not think twice about ordering products from you in the future!</li>
    <li> The fogless mirror works just as advertised. Everything is provided for easy and secure installation. Just great. If I needed another fog less mirror I would buy another one of these. Easy to operate and great to use.</li>
    <li> It works as it should, but I just attempted to replace the batteries and the plastic knobs on the back came off.  So now I have no way of opening the battery compartment and changing the batteries.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find this and hear some positive reviews. I found customer service very good initially when the tube of silicone was hardened. They sent it right out, nice attitude on the phone. Once I had hooked the support to the wall and filled the resevoir with water it didn&#x27;t fog. And here it is the thing that makes this product a total pass. Once filled with water it weighs more, and the engineers designed for no extra weight. So the adjustable angle bracket which  would work empty, now flops toward the ground and unless you want to shave your toe hairs is completely useless. I am handy with fixes but since it is only light plastic I am not about to use wood shims etc. to fix it, because the whole design is so lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t see how some reviews didn&#x27;t go into this issue more, but with the upper end model that I bought it is a total failure and a no buy. Sorry. Return time.&lt;br /&gt;  Oh yes one more bit of info. When I called them about this, i got no answer all day long. Left a message, no answer. Customer service fell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: They did contact me when they saw my review and were very helpful.They sent a new stronger biting piece and lo and behold the mirror is now adjustable and stays where you set it. Now I can say this product is great. Thanks&lt;br /&gt; I change my review to 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Jan 2013  Mirror works very nice. I find it even simpler to let the mirror warm up while I shower and shave at the end. I just take the mirror off, squeegy it, don&#x27;t bother filling it with water, and shave . The mirror doesn&#x27;t fog and I save wear and tear on the hardware, and save time. Works just as well as filling and emptying the resevoir everytime.  Have fun.</li>
    <li> I have loved shaving in shower for 30 years - bought this to replace a mirror I have had for 20 years - the silicone glue came all dried up but unexpectedly rec&#x27;d an e-mail from a company rep who fixed the problem immediately - very impressed by that. Once I got the glue and got the mirror up on my tile shower wall it has been nice to use.</li>
    <li> Whether you have a fogless shower mirror, or are looking to get your first one, you can&#x27;t go wrong with ToiletTree&#x27;s Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror. This is essentially the upgraded version of their basic Fogless Shower Mirror; this product is basically the same, except that it&#x27;s bigger, and it has the distinct and most definite advantage of having a bright white LED led that goes around all four sides of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation of this mirror is a breeze - use the included adhesive, or do a bit of an upgrade, as my husband often does, with a bit of super glue (just make sure you&#x27;re happy with where you&#x27;re placing it in your shower!). When you fill the back reservoir with water, the temperature/humidity on both sides of the mirror is essentially \\&quot;equalized\\&quot;, thus eliminating all but perhaps miniscule traces of fog. Water droplets may gather on the surface of the mirror, but if you periodically \\&quot;pre-treat\\&quot; the mirror with actual windshield washer fluid, you&#x27;ll find that the water beads up and runs off a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED light is white and bright - the lower setting is just fine, though of course depending on your bathroom lighting you may want to use the brighter setting (particularly at night). The lighting is a very nice inclusion, as it makes shaving (for him) and facial tweezing (for her) SO much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, the included squeegee does an excellent job of cleaning the mirror surface.</li>
    <li> When I tried to install my mirror I discovered that the supplied silicon was dried up and could not be used. I called the company and they sent out a new one, no questions asked. They also sent a HAND WRITTEN note and gave me a free gift(nail clippers) for my trouble! OUTSTANDING! I am happy with the mirror too.</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror that I have tried to date.  Very clear.  Lights could be a little brighter but still soft similar to my wife&#x27;s make-up mirror.  My previous mirror had bright led lights but they shined in my eyes like headlights on high beam making it difficult to see anything.</li>
    <li> This has to be the umpteenth shower mirror I have tried.  This one works!  First, it actually sticks to the wall without falling off.  Second, it is simple.  Just fill it with warm water and it stays fog free for the whole time.  What a concept!  Just don&#x27;t clean it with anything but the squeegee supplied with it.  I got the lighted one.  Didn&#x27;t really need the light but it seemed like a good idea.</li>
    <li> This review will be categorical, detailing specific points of interest for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-In the Box-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contents of the box included everything that was needed to both mount and operate this device: mounting bracket, mirror unit, 3xAA batteries, squeegee, and silicone adhesive.  The instructions for mounting and operation are what we have all undoubtedly come to expect, which is brief; however, the instructions were detailed and consise enough to leave no one confused about how to either instal or use this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Installation-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The installation instructions call for the use of the adhesive squares attached to the rear of the mounting bracket, as well as the application of the included adhesive silicone.  It is important to note here that I DID NOT follow these instructions when mounting this product.  Instead, I used Command waterproof mounting strips found below.  If you are in any way uncertain when installing this product, I do advise that you follow the included instructions to the letter, as I have likely voided the product warranty by doing what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are going to want to first prep the surface of the shower prior to using any method of installation where adhesive makes contact with the shower wall.  As I am sure we are all aware, repeated use of our showers results in this wonderful film that we must clean periodically.  Applying any adhesive to that film will cause the adhesive to bond to it, rather than the wall surface.  I used a healthy amount of Windex Commercial, because it contains ammonia.  Why?  Because a good portion of the cleaners we use on a daily basis leave a residue of thier own, which can and will interfere with adhesion.  I allowed the Windex to sit on the surface for approximately 2-3 minutes before using an abrasive pad to scrub the wall.  I then used a dry cloth to wipe away the moisture before using an alcohol prep pad on the surface I had just cleaned.  The instructions do call for the use of alcohol, and you may find this an unnecessary step, here&#x27;s why it isn&#x27;t:  when exposed to air, alcohol evaporates without leaving any sort of residue, which ensures that the adhesive can bond directly to the surface it is being applied to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the surface was cleaned, I removed the adhesive squares from the back of the mounting bracket, replacing them with the Command mounting strips (see included picture for placement).  I allowed the shower wall and mounting strips approximately 2-3 minutes before applying the bracket to the shower wall.  I then applied pressure to the bracket, to seat the mounting strips, for appoximately 30 seconds.  At this point I applied pressure to the tray on the bracket to ensure a solid bond before hanging the mirror unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will notice that I again applied pressure to the tray on the bracket once the mirror unit was in place (see included picture), deflecting the tray quite a bit.  I did this to demonstrate the effectiveness of the above installation.  While I have no doubt this unit will stay where it is until the end of time (I have hung heavy LED units with command strips that are in place after over a year), there is absolutely nothing wrong with the recommended installation.  The adhesive squares in combination with the silicone will hold the unit in place so long as you properly prep the surface.  I have read a few reviews of people gripping about the unit not staying in place, and that is because they didn&#x27;t properly prepare the surface.  You can glue a Buick to the side of a building, so long as the surface is properly prepared (Of course, there are other considerations when one decides to glue a car to a building, but I think you get my point).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Command Strips: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WSNM9Q/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-In the Shower-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filling the unit is pretty straightfoward and easy, with the top of the unit housing a fairly large opening to accomodate filling.  I used hot water as instructed, and was surprised that the only thing that wound up on the surface of the mirror were water dropplets from splashing.  I have used other units, even units that continiously cycle water behind the mirror, and all of them have devolped \\&quot;fog\\&quot;.  Using the mirror was pretty simple, though it is constructed in such a way as to magnify your face (or whatever you happen to want to aim the mirror at), so you do need to be standing fairly close to get an undistorted reflection.  The magnification made shaving my face easier than using a conventional wall mirror, primarily because I could literally see the pores in my face.  As I mentioned, water droplets did form on the surface of the mirror, and the included squeegee worked to clear them .  The squeegee is not long enough to clear the mirror in one pass, but I didn&#x27;t have to spend more than a few seconds using it to get a clear reflection.  All in all, I was pleased with the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Light-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light on the mirror is simple to activate, and is bright enough to illuminate your face if you need it.  I have a light built in to my shower, so I found no benefit in having a lit mirror.  If you shower in a cave however, you will likely find it quite useful.  The button on the side of the unit used to activate the light is easy to access, and doesn&#x27;t provide so much resistance that you need to be concerned with displacing the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Pivot-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mounting bracket has a built in pivot you can used to adjust the angle of the mirror up and down, which I found to be quite useful.  Not only was I able to use the mirror to shave my face, but the angle of the mirror also allowed me to groom my chest as well.  I suppose it goes without saying, but you could potentially use this mirror to shave any body reqion you so desired, depending on the mounting location of the mirror.  I noticed a few reviews that mentioned the noise the pivot makes when using it, as well as the fear of catastrophic failure as a result.  The pivot has teeth and uses friction to hold the mirror at the desired angle, so that is the \\&quot;snapping\\&quot; sound heard when adjusting the angle.  I played with the pivot pretty vigorously, and the mirror didn&#x27;t snap free and become airborn, so I don&#x27;t think you have anything to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Tray-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tray that is part of the mounting bracket is plastic, but fairly rigid.  I was able to apply a good bit of pressure to the tray without causing a great deal of deflection.  Given the space between the mirror unit and the tray, you will have no issue storing your razor as depicted.  The tray will accomodate any small item(s) not prone to rolling without concern of the tray deflecting and dropping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Conclussions-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an excellent product that does everything that it claims to do.  The mirror and the mounting braket are solidly made, and the anti-fog system works flawlessly in my experience.  The magnification and pivot make the mirror fairly versatile.  It is easy to instal, easy to fill, and easy to maintain; which makes this mirror worth the price-point.s surprised that the only thing that wound up on the surface of the mirror were water dropplets from splashing.  I have used other units, even units that continiously cycle water behind the mirror, and all of them have devolped \\&quot;fog\\&quot;.  Using the mirror was pretty simple, though it is constructed in such a way as to magnify your face (or whatever you happen to want to aim the mirror at), so you do need to be standing fairly close to get an undistorted reflection.

    <li> I really liked this mirror when i first got it.  It was bright and the anti-fog system works great.  However, over the past few months that i&#x27;ve owned it the \\&quot;gears\\&quot; that hold the mirror in position have stripped and now the mirror won&#x27;t stay up.  In other workds, the mirror can be roated up and down so you can see yourself, but that is all stripped and the mirror just points at the floor.  It started to do that when there was water in the mirror (it it heavier when filled with water - duh), but now it doesn&#x27;t even stay up when it&#x27;s empty.  The other thing is that if you leave the light on even once, the batteries will be completely run down.  Some kind of timer switch would be a nice feature, because most of us shave first thing in the morning (sleepy) and leaving a faint light on in the shower seems like something we would all do at some point.  Nice idea, but product didn&#x27;t last.  Now I have to figure out how to uninstall the bracket - which by the way is stuck on with silicone.</li>
    <li> Wow I cannot express enough how much my husband loves this product! I gave it to him for Valentine&#x27;s Day and he has thanked me for it almost everyday since then! He says that he wishes he&#x27;d had it sooner. We are now buying one for his father for Father&#x27;s day! If you shave in the shower this is a must have. Installation was a breeze. he was finished in maybe 10 minutes. you do have to wait 24 hours before you can use the shower after installing so that the sealer works properly.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I have bought several different brands including Sharper Image and this one works. Because you fill a reservoir in the back of the mirror with hot shower water it is impossible for the mirror to become foggy. What a simple concept. The mirror very easily and quickly removes from its base so that it can be filled. And likewise to be emptied.&lt;br /&gt;I have read some reviews that said it was difficult to install. I cant even imagine what they are talking about. Installation is simple and fast. (Don&#x27;t forget to let it dry for 24 hours after installed though) don&#x27;t waste your money on cheaper mirrors. Just get this one and you wont be replacing it to buy another!</li>
    <li> We were so disappointed with this mirror.  The lights on it quit working soon after we got it, and it got foggy.  We returned it soon after buying it.</li>
    <li> Great mirror even for being plastic and light is fantastic in my dark shower.</li>
    <li> Great product...works just as advertised. Lights are a plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my eye on this mirror for over a year and a half to replace one from another manufacturer which I used for close to 10 years. Reading reviews on this mirror and feeling confident that IF there were problems, the manufacturer would stand behind their product, I finally purchased it. I have only had it for about 2 weeks and it does work as advertised, simple to use, clear image with no fogging as expected. Pleasantly surprised that the mirror did come with batteries. That being said, the tube of silicone was virtually empty when I opened it, maybe about ⅜\\&quot; of silicone bead came out. I can see where this would be a problem for most people. In my business, I use silicone, so I just used my own. As to the claim that the LED light button on the side clicks thru a high intensity, low intensity and off... mine just is off and on. There is only one intensity. The 4 corners and 2 more LED lights on each edge light up. The light output and the clarity of the mirror are more than ample for shaving as is. I did phone the company and Gary Parisi, the CEO, answered the phone on the second ring. He confirmed the lighting arrangement and told me they did change the lighting due to customer feedback about having to click thru 2 light settings, thinking they had turned it off and finding dead batteries due to leaving the light on it&#x27;s lowest setting. He said they were in the process of changing the description and the instructions to reflect this product change. Hopefully, they will get to the root of the problem with the silicone tube supplier. As for me, that wasn&#x27;t a deal killer, but for most other people, I could see that they could be dismayed at having to wait for replacement silicone or have to buy their own. Mr Parisi did offer to send out the silicone right away, but I told him it wasn&#x27;t necessary. Wonderful customer service, concerned about their product and wanting to make sure their customers are happy is what separates the great companies from the rest of the pack.</li>
    <li> Keeps falling off the wall</li>
    <li> After a week the mirror came off (I follow the instruction). I am going to try one more time :(</li>
    <li> This shower mirror worked great until it fell off the bathroom wall and cracked.  I attached with the silicone adhesive provided and followed the instructions, cleaning both the shower and mounting bracket surfaces.  It held for about a month and the adhesive separated from the mirror bracket (remained attached to tile which had to be scraped off).  Since the return period expired, I was unable to return the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer contacted me immediately after posting my initial review and offered to send a replacement even though I was also refunded the full purchase amount.  Given this response I would recommend giving the mirror a try, as I said it works great.  I would recommend following all the installation instructions, including cleaning the wall and bracket thoroughly, and consider purchasing a third party silicone adhesive and applying liberally.</li>
    <li> Works just as described. No issues with installation (they provide a small tube of silicon adhesive that you cover the back plate with) and it feels quite securely affixed to the tile in my bathroom. With shipping the cost went up quite a bit which is why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best shower mirror made to date. The only drawback is that you need to replace it every 6 to 9 months because of a flaw in the pitch hinge of the mirror failing to hold after holding so much weight. but overall still the very best out there.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and better than expected. Great product from packaging and installation to use. I really like the lights and the shelf is great for storing your razor.</li>
    <li> It works EXACTLY as advertised! Exceeded my expectations in every way.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to install and DOES NOT FALL DOWN&lt;br /&gt;- Simple process to keep the mirror fog-free...and it really is fog-free&lt;br /&gt;- Light works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;After considering several VERY expensive shower mirror options, including one kept fog-free by hard wired, low voltage current, I am SO glad I got this one.  Buy it and enjoy shaving in the warm embrace of your shower!!</li>
    <li> This is the best mirror I have ever had. The mirror came in and wasn&#x27;t hard to put up. The mirror stays fogless for a while even as the water temperature drops in it. I shave my head and chin in the shower and the lights make shaving a breeze.</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product, aside from a few design flaws. The mirror hangs on a bracket that allows for you to change the angle. It&#x27;s weak at the pivot point and will break with wear. This product would preform better if the pivot point was stainless steel. Must take mirror off bracket to fill with water with each use, in order to keep it fog free. The plastic screws that hold the battery cover are poor quality. They broke shortly after use. Contacted manufacturer, they are sending replacement screws.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror does perform as advertised and is fog free, when used as directed.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review because the president of this company personally responds rapidly when you have an issue with the product.  My mirror happened to have fallen off the wall after about 6 months of use and broke. Toilettree promptly sent me a replacement. Due to the fact that this company believes in customer service, I recommend them with 5 stars.  The mirror is good and the lights are bright enough to shave without any other light.</li>
    <li> Good size, good light.  Works just fine, but filling it with hot water is a bit of a pain - it takes too long.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Although I paid a little more than I normally would for a fogless mirror, at least I don&#x27;t have to keep buying new fogless mirrors.  I have been using it for months and still have no issues or complaints.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this mirror a while ago and had no issues wth the product.  Recently, someone cleaned the mirrir with an abrasive sponge and scratched it to the point where it was difficult to see while shaving.  I ordered a new one which I received the end of last week.  Today was the first day using the new mirror and found that the mirrior leaks on the bottom to the extent the mirror tub is empty before finishing shaving which causes the mirror to begin to fog.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror, but there are some flaws to this product.  First, the mirror reflects your image a little like the mirrors you seem at a carnival and gives a warped image.  Second, after a few showers, I am noticing spots on the mirror that is not going away, they look like if someone sanded little dots on it.</li>
    <li> This fogless mirror is not very convenient to use at each use requires manually filling a reservoir behind the mirror with hot shower water. The built-in LED light is far too dim to shave by unless your shower stall is already well-lit. Worse, the adhesive strips and glue provided DO NOT hold the unit to a normal tile wall for more than a couple of weeks. After four tries re-installing this mirror I have given up and am throwing it away. In short, nice idea, poor design and execution.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror just over a year ago and it was great at first, over the past few months I have noticed the mirror material they spray on starting to peal off each time I fill it.  Now the entire edge of the mirror is gone, at the rate it is going in a few more months it will be unusable.  Great product for the price, but at the same time it should be a lot more durable at that price point.</li>
    <li> I had to return this mirror. Purchased as a Father&#x27;s Day gift, my husband loved it. Upon installation and first usage, the mirror failed to adhere to the shower wall and fell, shattering the mirror.</li>
    <li> After more than 1 year of satisfied usage, my other ToiletTree fogless mirror fell off the wall. I then accidentally broke the post that clips the mirror to the holding bracket or I wouldn&#x27;t be writing this review. Truth be told, I think I kind of applied the silicone crazy and may have contributed to to the bracket coming loose. And since I am being honest I think I neglected to empty out the water reservoir after every shower.    So purchasing this version instead of the other one, because this one has a light, and cost me what the other one did over a year ago. Based on the other mirror and my experience with both the company and product, I am giving a pre-emotive 5 star.    I would also highly suggest this company&#x27;s shower mirrors. My last one was great and worked wonderfully. I have no doubt that this one will be no different. Quality products are not flukes, and my last mirror was a very quality mirror, hands down.    08/27/2014  Mirror arrived quickly. I put it up in the shower, but more towards the back than the first one, and it love it! Yo wouldn&#x27;t think that a puny little LED would do much. You, like me, would be wrong. The LED really improves the lighting and helps you to see better while doing whatever. Installation was super easy, but I knew it would be because I also installed the regular model.    Speaking on the models, the LED is very well worth it. Having used both, I greatly prefer the LED version. I really like the ToileTree brand of products, and I am looking to get even more of the things they offer. These mirrors are truly fogless, and those squeegees wick away water quickly and clearly.     I honestly don&#x27;t know how anyone gives anything but 4 or 5 stars for these mirrors. There are help numbers all over in the packaging. There is also a big stop sign that says to call if you hVe any questions or concerns. Usually you have to dig to find that stuff, but as soon as you open the box you get a big stop sign with a number to help you with anything. I wouldn&#x27;t know about their customer service because I have never had to use it.    I would highly, HIGHLY recommend this to anyone that shaves. Shaving in the shower is about 15,000 times better than shaving at a sink or whatever. This mirror is a great purchase for personal use or as a gift. The mirrors are pretty big, like the size of a 3rd or 4th generation iPad, so you see your face very well. These mirrors also simply do not got up. You put in hot shower water, the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up. This company and it&#x27;s products have thoroughly impressed me, and I can&#x27;t say anything but good things about them.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE it!!!! The LED lighting is especially helpful since we do not have any lighting above the shower. This is a great gift idea for any guy! Idea....making the mirror in a magnified option:-)</li>
    <li> received on time..enjoy shavving in shower now</li>
    <li> just fill the reservoir with hot water from the shower and Voila! it&#x27;s fogless. BEST (and only) fogless mirror on the market that works!!!  had to buy 3 for different locations.  the BEST!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You put hot shower water in the mirrors&#x27; basin so that it&#x27;s temperature matches the shower and it will be steam free for 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror has this putty that comes with it to mount the mirror with, that doesn&#x27;t damage anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didn&#x27;t wait for it to cure the recommended length of time, so it did fall down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought more of that composite from amazon and so far so good for staying up.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Money very well spent.</li>
    <li> Was a little skeptical of claims of this mirror, had bought one before and it fogged up despite claims.. but my husband wanted one for shaving while showering, so thought i would try this one. Reviews were correct, very good product, glad I purchased. Just remember to let silicone sit OVERNIGHT do not just stick to the wall and take a shower.</li>
    <li> Bought it in December and after 3 months use the internal silver reflective coating starting coming off. The concept is good but the durability is poor. It works if you intend to replace it every few months since the warranty is good for only 30 days.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying I purchased this product in 2011. I had begun shaving my head, and wanted a fogless mirror for the shower. The product is well built, looks good, the mirror is distortion free and i was very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year later, i renovated the whole bathroom with a stall shower and new tile. I contacted ToiletTree to ask if i could buy a new silicone adhesive tube or could they recommend one i could pick up in the hardware store. Their customer service e-mailed me within 2 hours to tell me the stand behind their products and sent me a new adhesive kit for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now 3 full years after my purchase, and I emailed them again last night. I&#x27;d like to share my email and the response&lt;br /&gt;I recieved...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product back in 2011 so it really doesn&#x27;t owe me anything. I wanted to make you aware that the battery compartment leaked and the led&#x27;s no longer work. A bigger concern is that the ratchet that holds the mirror at an angle has become so loose that when the mirror is full of water, it can no longer support the weight and tilts all the way down. I love the product, and was just wondering if there was anything you could do for me or tell me a fix for tightening the bracket before I purchase a replacement. Thanks in advance,&lt;br /&gt;Neil Fishman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good morning Neil -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sorry about this. The good thing about owning a product from ToiletTree Products is that we will always stand behind what we sell, even if it was from 2011. I would like to send you a new mirror at no cost. We have also improved the pivot part so I will send you one of those as well. Just pop off the old one and replace with the new one I send you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please just confirm your address and I&#x27;ll have this mailed out today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Parisi&lt;br /&gt;President&lt;br /&gt;ToiletTree Products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let me be clear, the water getting into the battery compartment was probably my fault, and I hadn&#x27;t used the LED lights in a long time and the battery had leaked. The ratchet mechanism is plastic and I wasn&#x27;t surprised that it had loosened. 3+ years, this unit didn&#x27;t owe me anything. So to have the president of the company email me 1st thing in tne morning and replace the unit without hesitation is so refreshing to me. I give this product, and ToiletTree Products my highest recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to look through the rest of their product line.bly my fault, and I hadn&#x27;t used the LED lights in a long time and the battery had leaked.

    <li> A great mirror and even better customer service! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Not only did I very much like the mirror, I called about an issue with one of parts in teh box, left only a message, and received the part two days later.  Now that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talknig about!</li>
    <li> My husband was so excited to get this for Father&#x27;s Day.  He immediately installed it and used it the next morning.  Installation was easy.  So far he is very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who had been searching for a mirror that didn&#x27;t fog up for years. The only complaint we had was the silicone that came with the product was completely dried up so we went and bought our own. The mirror is as exactly as described and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great, mounting is stable (make sure to use both the mounting tape and the silicone included). Boyfriend loves the lights as he can shave while showering with clear view. Make sure to fill it with warm water. Only reason I didnot give 5 stars is because I wish it came with a little knob to drain the water out at the bottom instead of taking it off the hook and dumping it out again.</li>
    <li> I would have given it five stars if it would have held on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it fell off the second day of use, so I had to drill through the tiles and use wall anchors to hold it on the wall. Otherwise I love it!</li>
    <li> I feel that its not exactly worth the price, and It does still fog up even with a warm shower not hot;however, everyone has a different expectation of things. I bought it for my husband and it does the job, but I wouldn&#x27;t brag about to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband he LOVES IT!!! Best fogless shower mirror we have ever had! Easy to fill and keep clean, no distortion in the image</li>
    <li> A fantastic mirror for in the shower, with really good light and visibility.  Highly recomend! :D</li>
    <li> Nice size glad I bought it but don&#x27;t but this because it has a light for it is hardly any use at all for you will see need supplemental lighting.  The decription on mine when bought said it had a dim and bright settings but now is only made with the &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; for the dim has been eliminated as told by customer support.  But, even the &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; is not so bright.  Everything else with this is fine and as stated.</li>
    <li> We were worried about how well this would stay on the shower wall.  Well, it has worked great (over a month).  We have used cheaper types of mirrors and they fall within a couple of weeks.  Also, the anti-fog and the light are great.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I previously owned two Zadro Z&#x27;Fogless shower mirrors that were anything but fogless. The Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products performs exactly as promised. Not one bit of fog on the mirror even during the hottest of showers when you follow the instructions. Installation was a breeze. I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have this mirror for a very long time to come. Thanks ToiletTree!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror that does not fog at all. I originally ordered this mirror without the light and decided that i needed to upgrade. The light is a nice feature and it works well.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It actually works and makes shaving a much less tedious task in the steamy privacy of one&#x27;s shower.</li>
    <li> This product is great though you will have to clean around the hanging bracket until you decide to remove it. It isn&#x27;t so bad though because all the ones I have had that suction cupped to the wall have fallen, broken or sagged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a tip:&lt;br /&gt;Use enough of the silicone(you may have to supply some more) so that it comes out along all the edges of the hanger. Then wipe the excess off with a paper towel or your finger to make a good seal that will not let things build up behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bummer is the light is not very good. Thus the 4 star rating. It has maybe ten LEDs but they don&#x27;t provide any extra light unless you have a dungeon for a shower. I&#x27;ve had several of those and it would be ok there but not in a well lit bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s a great design STAYS FOG FREE unlike the treated ones and those you spray. It also looked like the battery box was well sealed where as my last ones weren&#x27;t and the batteries rusted &amp; exploded a couple times. The worst $30 I&#x27;ve ever spent. : (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so far so good just remember to dump the water after each use otherwise you get refreshing or eye opening cold water if you spill it or have to dump it in a small space like I do.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!!</li>
    <li> This product works fairly well. I like the adding the water to the back of the mirror feature -- this feature seems to make the mirror fogless. I previously had another &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; shower mirror without this feature and had to constantly wipe the fog away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I downgraded to 3 stars for 2 reasons -- the light isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be AND I couldn&#x27;t install the product. The silicone provided was defective -- it had hardened. I called the manufacturer and received replacement silicone. The replacement tube was 3 times bigger than the original tube. Was a little confusing because the silicone tube has a message on the tube -- you must use all the product for installation. If I had silicone that wasn&#x27;t defective --- the installation was simple and easy and would have taken less than 5 minutes. I downgraded one star for the light and one star for bad silicone.</li>
    <li> Bought this a few months ago since I&#x27;m an early Christmas shopper. My husband opened it and the buttons that are suppose to hold the back on were cracked and one fell off and the other is barely hanging on, which has rendered this shower mirror useless. Now I&#x27;m out of the return window and no way to contact the seller. Would like to have the option to return for refund or even an exchange so my husband could use his gift. Am I missing any options?</li>
    <li> Has a really great Bright light, works perfectly. My fiancé loves it! Great quality and stands the test of time</li>
    <li> Got this for myself for Christmas and i love it! Its awesome. I thought it might be a pain to fill the mirror and empty it but its really not. I did accidentally hang it a little to high on my wall though. Not sure if i can take it down and lower it but its still great! I would definetly recommend this. I&#x27;ve used it everyday since i&#x27;ve had it its that awesome!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for husband and he loves it! It looks great in our shower-slim and sleek. Asking as the water basin is filled there is absolutely no fog! Great product!</li>
    <li> It works but not the best design.  Mirror has to removed, dump water, refilled, and remounted for each use.  Should instead have filler at top andy valve at bottom to release water.</li>
    <li> I am an engineer and I have to give them credit that they really designed a product worthy of a 5 star rating.  You can tell that some thought was give. To this products design. It stayed fog free as promise. (Mind you that&#x27;s based on 1 use).  Installation was easy. I am optimistic that the mirror will provide some longevity... more to follow if it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, initially came with defective silicone glue, customer servive at Toiletree corrected it immediately shipped me a new one, product works as advertised, very happy.</li>
    <li> I installed this mirror in my shower and it immediately fogged up when I started to run the water.  It was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I originally had the Fogless mirror and recently upgraded to the Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror. Both mirrors are great but the new deluxe model is perfect. It is a great size, the LED lights help and it works terrific. With the original mirror I had a problem with the hinge not holding up the mirror properly when filled to the top with water. I wrote the company and got an immediate response and a new hinge in a few days....this despite the fact that it was well over a year since I bought the mirror. That is what I call outstanding customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you who own the Fogless Mirror can upgrade and use the existing bracket which makes it so easy to install.....I recommend this with enthusiasm and appreciate the excellent customer support they provide.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go back to shaving in a sink ever again, this thing is great!</li>
    <li> best thing I ever bought</li>
    <li> The mirror did everything it advertised however I gave it four stars.  The fifth star was held back because after about 5 months of use it fell down and the faceframe broke in several pieces.  While I installed it using the manufacturers recommendations apparently the silicone separated from the base of the unit because the silicone was still adhered to the tile very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where I give the manufacturer five stars . . . after the item fell and broke I was trying to assess my options.  I really like the mirror and it worked perfectly.  It was well beyond the Amazon return period so I took a shot and contacted Toilettree via email explaining my situation and including my Amazon order number for verification.  The very next day, the Director of Marketing apologized and offered a replacement mirror with additional silicone to enhance the adhesion to my tile shower wall.  Several days later, I received the new mirror and installed it using the additional silicone.  Now that is customer service . . . not many companies are willing to back there products like that anymore.  I was so impressed I have looked at several other items Toilettree offers because they have my brand loyalty.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great. Had it a month now and I love it</li>
    <li> Even though we have a light in the shower it was hard to see using a suction cup mirror that kept falling off the wall every week or so.  By mounting the LED mirror a little lower and angling the mirror up it allowed more light on my neck and face.</li>
    <li> My husband never shaved in the shower before and now he loves it. (And I love it too since he doesn&#x27;t leave the sink area soaking wet anymore) This mirror is fabulous - never fogs. Can&#x27;t attest to the lights because we don&#x27;t use them.  We had one issue with the product that was ultimately resolved - after a while the mirror started to fall downward - as also noted by some other reviewers.  I called toilet tree (excellent customer service) and they informed me they have fixed that issue and immediately sent me a replacement piece at no cost. I have had no other issues with that and the mirror is working fabulously for over a year now.</li>
    <li> fell apart pretty quickly and fogged up too</li>
    <li> This is a quality piece. Works extremely well. Easy install and really stays fogless when used as directed. Nice looking too.  A guest thought I&#x27;d placed a HDTV in my shower!</li>
    <li> ***Update - I called customer service and they immediately shipped me out a new mirror to replace the leaky one. I just hope I don&#x27;t have the same problem with the new mirror, or I&#x27;ll be calling them for a replacement mirror every month.***  After reading the bad reviews, we were very careful about mounting the mirror properly so that it would not fall off the wall. The mirror worked great for about a month. It&#x27;s still attached firmly to the wall. The problem we encountered is that, after a month, the water started leaking out of the reservoir. It leaks so fast that the water is gone in a couple minutes and the mirror fogs up. The water idea is great, but the reservoir needs to be one solid piece. If there is a way out, water will find it, as it has in our case. When I pay this much for a fogless shower mirror, I expect it to last a few years, not one month.</li>
    <li> I really liked this mirror for two weeks at which point it fell off of the wall.  The glue supplied does not hold for long.&lt;br /&gt;I will try the hardware store for stronger glue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different types of \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shower mirrors.  All of these products involve trade-offs among the triangle of Cost-Convenience-Quality factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the active type, which uses plumbed water to keep the mirror fog-free (works well but is pricey, and prone to breakage).  I&#x27;ve use the treated-surface mirrors which work to varying degrees, but consistently fail withing a few months.  I&#x27;ve also tried the heat-and-shave type that can&#x27;t seem to last my entire shave.  Of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, so far, this mirror offers the best balance of Cost, Convenience and Quality - that is, it works well, it&#x27;s easy to use, and it doesn&#x27;t rely on any complicated technologies to accomplish it&#x27;s job, meaning it should last for a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ToiletTree Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror offers ample mirror space and an exceptionally bright, but well distributed, light.  The fogless technology is simple (warm water behind the mirror) and relies only on the same shower water that is causing the fog in the first place.  The mirror includes a squeegee that works well.  Though a subtlety, consistent squeegee use will extend the life of the mirror&#x27;s surface.  Folks with harder water, even if softened, will have particulate in the water that can accumulate on the mirror surface and \\&quot;dim\\&quot; the reflection over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative, if it can even be considered as such, is that you must manually fill and empty the reservoir behind the mirror.  Still, when balanced against all of the positives, I consider this \\&quot;negative\\&quot; to be, at most, a minor inconvenience which I would happily take over the Cost and Quality negatives I&#x27;ve found in other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--UPDATE 5/11/13-- I have come to appreciate this mirror even more over the last couple of months.  The mirror has remained bright and clear, and the mount has remained firm.  In fact this mirror has the best viewable reflection of any of the shower-shave mirrors I&#x27;ve used.  The only \\&quot;wear\\&quot; visible is some minor water softener build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--UPDATE 2/27/14-- A few months ago (Oct&#x27;13), after daily use, I had a problem with the silver backing of the mirror flaking off.  While the overall product was still serviceable, I felt that this should be addressed.  After contacting ToiletTree via email and expressing my concerns, Kelly from ToiletTree&#x27;s Marketing org contacted me arrange for a replacement mirror.  I received the replacement mirror in a few days and have had no other problems since then (~4mos).  If I had to score Toiletree on this issue, I&#x27;d say -1 for the minor product defect, but +5 for quickly \\&quot;making it right\\&quot;.wear\\&quot; visible is some minor water softener build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--UPDATE 2/27/14-- A few months ago (Oct&#x27;13), after daily use, I had a problem with the silver backing of the mirror flaking off.

    <li> The Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror by ToiletTree Products is the best fogless mirror I&#x27;ve ever used, resulting in the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  The design is unique, innovative, and has redefined the market.  The mirror does NOT fog and maintains a perfect reflection.  The silicone adhesive works perfectly, keeping the mirror firmly placed on the shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally the staff at ToiletTree Products, led by their CEO Gary Parisi, is wonderful.  They are responsive to the needs of their customers and are always looking for new ways to enhance their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend buying this product, as well as doing business with ToiletTree.</li>
    <li> It stays put and works great. After buying the others and needing to replace them, we decided to go with the best</li>
    <li> This is the first shower mirror I have bought which does not fog up.  If you shave in the shower, this is the mirror for you.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Would have liked it even better if it were longer from top to bottom. Still a very ggod product.</li>
    <li> I have tried for years to get a product this good. Their brilliance was the idea that putting warm water in the back of the unit assures no fogging. Works exactly as indicated. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This is my first product review I&#x27;ve written and I&#x27;ll tell you why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the product for almost 3 yrs, it does what is says and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. It is easy to hang and I really like the clarity of the mirror while showering. It provides an excellent shower shaving experience. IMPORTANT NOTE: You need to fill up a small reservoir behind the mirror with water from the shower (which is what keeps it from fogging) but it is easy to fill, re-hang and dump after your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to complement the company President of ToiletTree for his quick response to a minor issue I had with it. I was extremely impressed how promptly he responded to my concern as well as how ToiletTree stand by their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few different no-fog mirrors in the years and I&#x27;m familiar with them so it&#x27;s easy and my pleasure for me to recommend 100%.  Follow the simple directions and you&#x27;ll be as satisfied as I have been.</li>
    <li> So far this mirror works great.  Just hang it on the wall with the supplied glue and install the batteries.  I wish the light shined on my face better but that is only a small complaint.  You just fill this up with the warm shower or bath water and the mirror does not fog up!  Best shower mirror I have used.  No special coating or anything, just fill with warm water and go shave.</li>
    <li> Just like all the reviews said this fogless shower mirror is the best. I bought it for my husband for xmas based on the fact that it had the best reviews.I was not disappointed when I saw it and my husband loves it.it.</li>
    <li> Mirror does what it promises! Idea makes sense since it doesn&#x27;t depend on a mirror coating. Bigger size than other fogless mirrors out there, so it makes it easier to shave. The LED lights work well, but don&#x27;t produce enough light to not need additional lighting. A good purchase overall!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who is a stroke survivor and needed a mirror in order to shave. I loved the sturdiness right away. The set up instructions are fool proof. The little shelf is a nice feature and the way the squee gee fits into the frame is clever. the larger mirror size made shaving much easier for my husband, since he needs to sit a little distance away.</li>
    <li> Truly fog free.  I&#x27;ve owned several fog less shaving mirrors,this by far is the best,fog free through- out my shower.  One minor issue for me is the size of the squeegee, while sized for the mirror it&#x27;s small size is hard to handle with large man hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few different shower mirrors over the years.  This is easily the best by a wide margin.  It&#x27;s simple to install, it works perfectly and it requires no special care.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> What a GREAT product! I started shaving in the shower about 6 months ago for the ease and closer shave that you can get by doing so. Wish I would have started years ago being that I am a middle aged man. At first I went and purchased a cheaper fog free mirror with suction cups at a local place, one of those $12 ones with no light. Well you get what you pay for! I went in search of a good one with a light and came across this mirror!!!! WOW!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The way it attaches to the surface in the shower is very secure and easy to install. I do recommend waiting 24 hours after installing before the first use like the instructions say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The truly fog free mirror is great by running warm water into reservoir in the back of mirror. Even if you forget to fill it up when you first get started in the shower and it fogs up just take the mirror out of its cradle and fill it then. Within around 10 seconds after filling it up with the shower water the fog will disappear completely. Once you get use to using it you will remember to fill it up first thing then. I also recommend before getting out of shower to empty the water out of the reservoir because it is a little surprise if you wait till the next time you are in shower and empty the cool water out on your feet by accident. You know the wife will defiantly not like that! LOL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Being able to adjust the angle for multiple users is good to. The only advise I might give on this is if you adjust it be sure to use both hands and the sides and adjust it easy and one click at a time. I don&#x27;t have to adjust mine, but it seems like you could damage easily by snatching and jerking on it to quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The LED light is great also for halfway dim lit bathrooms. I just wish it was a little bit brighter than it is. I suppose this is because it would use up the batteries a lot quicker, but it would be worth it to me because I truly love the &amp;#34;Shower Shaving Experience&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the mirror for about 2 months now and wanted to use it for awhile and then write a review. This is a FANTASTIC addition to the shower for grooming and well worth the money!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this for any man to shave or woman for grooming needs in the shower!!!!!!!!!!!!!ing the mirror for about 2 months now and wanted to use it for awhile and then write a review. This is a FANTASTIC addition to the shower for grooming and well worth the money!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this for any man to shave or woman for grooming needs in the shower!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 different mirrors for my shower. Both of these mirrors claimed to be fog less. They were at first then they started fogging up. A friend recommended this mirror, he said it couldnt fog up. He explained to me that behind this mirror is a reservoir to fill up with warm water from the shower and that keeps it from fogging. I had to get one then. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it works great. The light is just the right brightness also. I was skeptical about the $50 price tag but I promise, it&#x27;s worth is. Any other reviewer that claims this mirror isnt fog less is one of those types of people that cant be pleased. You could give them a million dollars and they would complain that it gets taxed.</li>
    <li> Great attention to detail; packaging, mounting mechanism, silicone glue, instruction manual, etc. The mirror remains fogless during a shower and lights up adequately, NOT great.  Note; the mirror requires visual insertion (side view) while balancing a water filled mirror onto the supporting bracket (on the back of the mirror) with every use.  It is not that simple of a task.  The mirror works adequately as advertised and better than any other mirror I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  Hope this helps...</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, some of which were pretty extreme, I decided to try it anyway and am very happy with it over all.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and it is firmly mounted, fog free and surprisingly large. My main complaint is that unlike most shaving mirrors, this one is concave, meaning that it makes your face *smaller* rather than magnifying your whiskers. Seems more than a little odd. Still, it beats the heck out of leaning over my bathroom sink. Oh, and as most people have said, the LED lights are utterly useless, unless you are attempting to shave in total darkness.</li>
    <li> I really like my shower mirror.  I wish it had a 5x or 10x section to see more up close.  The light around the edge doesn&#x27;t really do much.  But the mirror works as advertised and is well constructed.</li>
    <li> Great shower mirror! I bought it for my husband as a Christmas gift and he is very happy. We hung it in the shower according to the instructions and we&#x27;ve had no problems with it. Very good product!</li>
    <li> Does as advertised.  Sticks on wall.  Easy for someone who is NOT A HANDYMAN.  Only improvement could be a drain at bottom of water well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews. I liked what I read about this and the non deluxe version. After shopping around in stores I couldn&#x27;t find one that I liked. This mirror does it all. I will be very happy with it for a long time. The light is useful to me. I&#x27;ve become very accustom to using it. Since I have a beard it&#x27;s a little hard to see the line under my chin so that&#x27;s where the light comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have been nice to know that it was going to take 24 hours for the silicone to dry before I could use the mirror. I also spent three days holding it various places around my shower since I was scared to pick the wrong location and then not being able to move it later.</li>
    <li> This little invention changed the way my entire bathroom looks.  It is one of my all-time favorite cool things.  I don&#x27;t know how bright other people think a shaving light should be, but I think the light this little guy gives off is perfect.  I can see my face to shave in the shower for the first time in my life.  (I have a tough beard and shaving in the shower makes it easier on my skin). I buy every shower mirror I walk by - and after using them, I always think what an idiot I am to believe anything that says &amp;#34;Fog-free&amp;#34;.  Last week, I was idly looking at shower doo-dads that might give my shower more pizzaz (it&#x27;s organized to perfection and shiny clean, but boring as hell.)  I ran across the ad for this mirror.  Cursing myself for being so gullible, I ordered it.  When I took it out of the box, it looked just like the ad - big and shiny and contemporary.  Could it be the mirror I&#x27;ve been looking for?  I carefully followed the installation instructions and began my 24 hour wait.  When it was all set up and I turned on the light, I was like a kid on Christmas..  It looked so good!  I could see my whole face.  It brightened my shower AND my day.  But I was steeling myself to be disappointed when, inevitably, fog would appear on the mirror and ruin my moment of fun.  I filled up the reservoir, and I jumped into the shower.  I waited as steam rose up around me and enveloped the mirror and.... there was ABSOLUTELY NO FOG AT ALL ON THE MIRROR.  Genius.  Why didn&#x27;t someone come up with this simple solution before?  I guess the people at ToiletTree are not just sitting around doing their nails!!  The look of the mirror is totally awesome.  I&#x27;ve already had a couple of friends come out of the bathroom raving about it.  (I purposely leave the light on when I know someone is dropping by.  LOL).  A friend who spent the night just came out of the shower and announced that he did not want to get out of the shower because he could see how &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; he is.  (Our girlfriends are sisters).  He couldn&#x27;t quit talking about my &amp;#34;cool mirror.&amp;#34;  LOL.  BTW, it was a snap to secure it to the tile wall in my shower...the silicone adhesive worked perfectly.  The people at ToiletTree have reached out to me several times to make sure that I am totally happy with their product, and exactly what they will do to fix any problem I may have with it.  They are proud of their brand - and want to keep it sterling.  I haven&#x27;t been happier with a purchase of any kind - ever.  Buy this thing....follow the daggone directions and enjoy your showers more than you thought you ever would!riends are sisters).

    <li> First off, let me say how excited I was to finally find a product who&#x27;s claims and reviews seemed perfect for what I was looking for.  A lighted, fogless mirror for the shower.  While the description did not make any false claims, the actual product isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d expect. (1) This is NOT a glass mirror but a plastic surface polished to provide a clear reflection. The problem with that is when the case is filled with water (that&#x27;s how they keep it fogless) the \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; bends thus distorting the image. (2) the wall mount needs to be glued to the wall, This creates an issue if and when you want to remove or move the mirror&#x27;s location, so be certain you put it exactly where you want it the first time. (3) the hinge to attach the mirror to the wall mount is also plastic. Thin plastic. two tiny pegs that snap in place.  This creates several issues: Unless you have a showerhead on a hose, you will have to unsnap the mirror every time you attempt to use it because you have to fill the mirror&#x27;s case with hot water to create the fogless environment. This mount is also supposed to make it so you can tilt the mirror, adjusting the angle up/down for better viewing. Unfortunately, the plastic is so thin and the peg is so small, these will surely break after a few attempts to remove/attach, and the weight of the water filled mirror is barely supported by the thin plastic hinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, By purchasing though Amazon, I was able to return this substandard product for a full refund.[[ASIN:B005OSQGN8 Pivoting Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee]]</li>
    <li> It sticks to the shower wall ok, but the lights are so dim I still can&#x27;t see. I put it in the trash yesterday.</li>
    <li> Mirror works very well.  Light is bright and easy to turn off and on.  Unit requires you to fill it with warm water each time you use it -- and works like a champ. Mounting bracket with easy removal sliding clamp makes filling and dumping of water extremely easy.  Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is my second mirror and it is just as good as the first; better even, because this one has a light. I have also recommended the mirrors to friends and they too are thrilled. If I had any complaint, it would be that the squeegee does not clear away all the water but  that is a very minor thing. Do NOT hesitate to purchase this product or the mirror without the light either!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for about a month, after upgrading from ToiletTree&#x27;s original fogless mirror.  I was always happy with the original and it was actually the first 5 star review/rating I ever wrote on  Amazon. I never had any problems with the original mirror, the Delux LED was a gift.  If you already have the original, this new mirror easy slips over the same bracket.  It is quick and easy to fill the back reservoir with water, it never fogs, I love the new size of the mirror, and I use the shelf for my toothbrush.  As a women, I use the mirror daily for cleaning/exfoliating my face as well as brushing my teeth. I&#x27;ve also used the mirror for tweezing my eyebrows and the LED lights are great for that!  I&#x27;ve never felt the need to use the squeegee, but it&#x27;s a nice added feature.  At this point, I can&#x27;t imagine showering without a mirror!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many shower mirrors in the past and they all had major flaws (fog up, leak water, etc.), but this one is well thought out and overcomes all of the weaknesses of previous shower mirrors. As long as the directions are followed to the T, there shouldn&#x27;t be any problems (unless the item is defective). As previously mentioned in other postings, make sure you use all of the silicon to adhere the base to the wall and the unit needs to be filled with warm/hot water otherwise it will fog up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, there is one small design issue with the mirror; the battery compartment (and I&#x27;ve seen others with the same problem), when I go to open it up (turning the screws to the open position), the lid does not come out -- I had to force it open and when I did very small plastic parts broke off. The mirror is still very much usable, I simply pushed the lid back on and it remains in place (just not 100% sealed). So, Steve if you are reading this, you might want to think about this when it&#x27;s time for a redesign. Otherwise, I love the mirror (I&#x27;ve never seen my face so clear in the shower before).</li>
    <li> I previously owned the original ToiletTree shower mirror which I had for about 3 years. The lighting in my shower was very poor so I decided to upgrade to the lighted version. This is by far the best shower mirror on the market - the technology behind the mirror, it&#x27;s size, the super bright LED light, and the convenient razor shelf all make this a great mirror.</li>
    <li> Works great doesn&#x27;t fog as advertised. Easy to use and mount. I would of given it 5 stars but mirror angle adjustment is a tad bit tricky.</li>
    <li> This deluxe shaving mirror saves me about 15 minutes in the morning. If you&#x27;re anything like me, 15 minutes in the morning is like an hour in day time hours.  I really like not having to keep up with and apply the anti-fog sprays to the mirror, which only temporarily work (so I hear). Filling the back with water that goes in the back of the mirrow only takes about 10 seconds and discarding the water after shaving takes a bout 5 second.  Shaving in the shower with all the steam, makes you&#x27;re shaving experience much closer and comfortable, I find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, when I wake up in the morning, I stumble to the shower FIRST. No more going to the sink... washing my face shaving AND THEN  stumbling to the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent way to start the day... and with much less stumbling, my chances are much greater in making it to work...  LOL</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  I shave in the shower (face and head).  The anti-fog system of filling up the mirror&#x27;s back cavity with water works very well.  The additional LED lighting was much needed in our shower as it was somewhat dark in there.  The only con to this device was that the silicone mounted method only held a couple of days.  And I know for certain I took great care in prepping the surface and waiting over 24hrs to add the mirror to it.  The silicone was still stuck to the tile, but broke loose from the plastic mount for the mirror.  I opted to rehang it with 2 stainless steel screws and plastic anchors drilled into the grout lines.  This is the only reason I removed one star from this item&#x27;s review.  Other than that, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit of an idiot buying things online, always trusting the promotions.  I&#x27;ve bought three supposed \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shower mirrors before this one and regretted each, all were completely worthless.  However, this mirror is great.  It does just as advertised, with the mounting quite easy and the fog less ability an actual reality, once you run hot water into it to fill its reservoir. The LED light is surprisingly bright and luminance, only wish it turned off automatically after a few minutes.  That you can tilt it up or down and can easily remove it from its mount is also pretty cool, as is its rack for my razor and its little squeeze to clear the mirror when you need to have it completely droplet-free.  Overall, I haven&#x27;t seen another like it that&#x27;s nearly as good.  Only wish its mirror could magnify, but those that claim to be are among the worthless ones I&#x27;ve tossed.</li>
    <li> I just purchased the LED fogless mirror after owning the non-LED version for a while. This mirror is outstanding!  It&#x27;s not just a &amp;#34;lighted&amp;#34; version of the regular mirror...it&#x27;s bigger, better and brighter!  If you&#x27;re looking for a fog less shower mirror...this is the one!</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  The one disappointment is the &amp;#34;epoxy&amp;#34; to adhere the mirror to the tiles.  The information did not indicate that it would come off easily or at all, therefore I wasn&#x27;t about to ruin tile.  So I had to rig it with suction cups.  Lights not really bright enough.  Using water to make it fogless is a great idea.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Not only was this as good as the company says it is, the installation process and ease of use exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I have gone through quite a few &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors and have yet to be satisfied.  Most of them are great for a few weeks and then the film wears off and they are useless.  This design is brilliant!!!  I thought having to fill it every morning would be tedious but its not at all. Takes 2-3 secs using the shower water.  I will never have a fogged mirror again and this should last a LONG time!!</li>
    <li> This mirror is okay.  My fiance uses it to trim his beard in the shower and he likes it.  It seems to me that the mirror is sort of warped, and the light is not as bright as I think it should be.  Overall, he seems to like it just fine.</li>
    <li> The door to put the batteries in stinks...otherwise it&#x27;s a good product. I would recommend and here is my extra word.</li>
    <li> LED light quit working after a month.  The mirror is nice and big, but the lighting is horrible[[ASIN:B005OSQGN8 Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.]]</li>
    <li> I had the non-LED version and loved it so much but when I moved I wanted to get a new one. This one is just as good as the original AND it lights up AND I think it&#x27;s larger? Installation couldn&#x27;t be easier and it&#x27;s essential for me in a shower. I don&#x27;t know how people shower without one!</li>
    <li> Update:  The manufacturer has agreed to send me a replacement free of charge.  Excellent customer service like this helps with hesitancy of online purchases. Glad to see a company stand behind their warranty.   I will update review once more after receiving replacement!    Prior review:  One year later and the film has all peeled off and mirror is super foggy. The stand is great and the mirror was great for the first 6 months. Perhaps I just got a dud. Wish I could get a replacement mirror without dropping another fifty bucks.</li>
    <li> While this is a great item that I used for &amp;#62; 1 year prior to my repurchase, the glue catastrophically failed and the mirror frame broke upon impact in the shower.  I would&#x27;ve given a 1 star review because I installed it correctly and the glue didn&#x27;t hold; but felt that would be a contradiction since I ordered another one.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  quality mirror, anti-fog (by adding warm water to back of mirror), little squeegee, resting place for your razor(s), and the LED lighting.&lt;br /&gt;Con: my first one fell off and left the glue on the tiles of my shower to which I had to spend time cleaning off before I could reapply a new unbroken mirror.</li>
    <li> Fell off the shower wall after six months.</li>
    <li> Much to my surprise, it works perfectly.  I have used it daily for shaving in the shower now for about 6 months.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It only takes about 5 seconds to fill the reservoir.  Blows away my prior mirror and my prior mirrors before that.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Better than other mirrors in market Light option not worth $10.00. Light needs improvement, more output.</li>
    <li> My husband says this is the best shower mirror!  He loves that its large and that it won&#x27;t fog up!</li>
    <li> Early yet, but love it so far.  As advertised</li>
    <li> I have a shower with no direct light inside so a lighted mirror with fog-free capabilities was a must.  I will say filling it with hot water does do the job and the squeegee is handy to help get splash marks off the face of the mirror.  It mounts with both 3M adhesive tape and a tube of silicon gel and I was able to secure it to a slightly porous tile surface and it held for about 9 months and one day I came into the shower and it was in the tub.  I went to the hardware store, bought more 3M tape and a tube of silicon gel and it&#x27;s holding fine again.  The cool thing about the silicon gel is it can be peeled off if you move or just want it gone.  My son is about 4 inches taller than I and to pivot the mirror angle proved a bonus for us.  I leave my razor on the shelf and typically fill the reservoir by leaving it attached to the wall as my shower head is hand held.  I recommend leaving the light on until after you empty the reservoir as a reminder to do so and then switch it off.  So far I haven&#x27;t forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the angle of the lighting.  My shower is fairly dim and if I could have one change it would be to point the LED lights less toward the mirror and more toward my face so that my face is better lighted up rather than the surface of the mirror which tends to create not a steam haze but an odd reflective issue I feel would better be handled by lighting up my the face.</li>
    <li> Works good doesn&#x27;t fog up</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a safety razor &amp; I had been looking for a shaving mirror for a while but could never find one that I really liked.  After some research I decided on this one.  This is an excellent product &amp; it works great.  It attached to my shower wall with no trouble.  All I have to do is fill the reservoir with hot water, squeegee it off with the included squeegee, turn on the led lights &amp; shaving is breeze.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good shaving mirror, this one is definitely worth it.  They have one that doesn&#x27;t have the led lights, but I would recommend forking over the extra money to get this one.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my son as a Christmas gift.  He says it works great.</li>
    <li> purchased to give as gift.  Person receiving gift very pleased</li>
    <li> This mirror will give you a fog free shaving experience as long as you follow the directions. They are there for a reason. I really enjoy using this and it makes my mornings getting dressed less of a hassle because I can shave in the shower. Much less mess and faster getting out the door.!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent, well-thought out product that solves the steamy mirror issue for the shower.  I didn&#x27;t realize that the product needs to be filled with warm water on each use, but that has turned out to be both effective and easy.  The adhesion system provided with the product is excellent.  The mirror is excellent quality.  I only have two wish list items for the maker of the product.  First, the provided squeegy is too flexible to do a good job cleaning the water from the mirror.  A better quality squeegy would be desirable (more rigid).  The second is that I would rather have hooks or hangers to hang my razor than the single shelf which basically only works for one razor.  Those are ideas for improvement, but neither are a reason to not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this product for my honest opinion. This is the best mirror I&#x27;ve ever used. It has battery operated LED lighting that can be used on high, low or off. The lighting in my shower is efficient enough that I don&#x27;t really need to use the LED light. I like the squeege that is included to clear the water droplets away along with the shelf to sit my razor on. However the one thing that I don&#x27;t really care for is that I have to fill the reservoir with warm water to keep the mirror \\&quot;fogless\\&quot;. It has to be filled and emptied for each use. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal but one more thing to add to my morning routine that I could do without. Would be better if they could make it with a fogless mirror that didn&#x27;t require adding the water.Overall the assembly was easy and the directions were simple to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above products through Sublime Media Connection in exchange for an honest review.  In no way was I asked to give a positive review.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have had many \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shower mirrors that just don&#x27;t work.  This is a great design and would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This mirror really works. I have owned many others in the past and end up throwing them away, as the mirror starts to lose clarity. The LED&#x27;s work well at highlighting the face. My only issue is a minor one-I wish the shelf had hooks for a razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Mirror stays crystal clear. No fog. Best I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband so I am writing this review for him. First he loved that he could mount it to the tiled shower and  no longer had to worry about it falling off while he was shaving.  It is truely fogless and he liked the small squeegee, found it helpful.  Took him a while to get use to putting the mirror back on the mount after filling it up with water but says he&#x27;s just about mastered that.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Being 63 and having owned homes for close to 40 years, I have owned many and various shower mirrors.  I&#x27;ve always preferred shaving in the shower and a crystal clear mirror is a prerequisite to that end.  I&#x27;ve had mirrors that supposedly wouldn&#x27;t fog (they did).  I&#x27;ve had mirrors that you had to apply a weekly coat of anti-fog lotion (ineffective), and I&#x27;ve had mirrors that soon were impossible to see my own reflection in because the mirror itself was inferior.  Mind you, I always paid for the most expensive mirror available thinking that &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  They ALL have been abyssmal failures - until now.  The Deluxe LED Fogless Mirror has exceeded my expectations and is by FAR the best showere mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned.  As I luxuriate in my very roomy shower stall with gallons of hot water flowing over me and clouds of steam fogging up the windows and door, this mirror remains crystal clear - and I mean CRYSTAL CLEAR!!!.  Just take 10 seconds to fill up the back reservoir with hot shower water and you are good to go, for as long as your hot water heater allows you to stay in the shower.  There&#x27;s no other product out there that compares (other than the ones that require you to hire a plumber to install).  Don&#x27;t look any further.  This is the best.  PERIOD!!!</li>
    <li> This mirror is great!  It doesn&#x27;t fog up at all.  Is bigger than other shower mirrors I have had and the light is a great extra.</li>
    <li> I bought this prpduct las November. And on january the lighta wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I thought that perhaps i left it on and the batteries drained. But after changing the batteries lights would still not turn on. Only without water would SOMETIMES the light would function. The fogless part works greats due to the water recepctacle. But the light not so great</li>
    <li> This is great.  No fogging up, easy to install, and the light is nice as well.  Would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you need glasses to read. This mirror will actually shrink your face. I couldn&#x27;t see my face to shave.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this product I bought another for my beach home.&lt;br /&gt;It never fogs, has a large mirror, the lights work all the time, it tilts and it has never fallen down.&lt;br /&gt;A must buy if you shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> Wanted a larger mirror for shaving in the shower that didn&#x27;t want to fog. This product does just that quite well. I haven&#x27;t had the need to use the led lighting yet, but it is nice to have if I need it later. Installation was easy and is still rock solid on the fiberglass enclosure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product, glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower mirror I have ever seen. The quality is very nice. Attaches to the wall very nicely and the light is very bright.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sometimes a little skeptical about Glowing Reviews of products, and there were lots of them for this item on the Amazon.com site.  But I have to admit, the Toilet Tree Fog-less Shower Mirror met or exceeded all of my expectations.  It&#x27;s a great product and I recommend it for any one looking for a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as a gift! As now the lighting in our new bath room is not directly from the shower unit, this mirror is really nice with the added lighting and bigger mirror surface. The fogfree feature works great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is very happy to receive and use it and had commented on one improvement that this can have to make it perfect: In his old fogless mirror, in the unit for the warm water, it has a hole so that after shower the water can slowly leak out if you forget to empty the water before you end shower, so that next time you don&#x27;t have to splash cold water out.</li>
    <li> Perfect shave in the shower, very simple no fog mirror. Stays in place if you follow the installation instructions. Light is ver convenient. Large perfect size.</li>
    <li> Does what it promised.  A little troublesome to have to remove it &amp; fill it with hot water for every shower.</li>
    <li> Broke within 3 months of use. Fell right off the shower wall and shattered.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a year ago and the LEDs no longer work and it leaks now.</li>
    <li> This mirror was easy to install in our shower and it has stayed put using a combination of suction cups and a silicone adhesive, which, it is claimed, will hold the unit in place forever, but can be removed if necessary down the road. In use, one fills the reservoir with hot water from the shower, which keeps it from fogging. The built-in squeegee does the job well enough to remove most of the droplets that might collect on the mirror. The LED lights have two settings, one brighter than the other, accessed by a button on the right side when facing the unit. The user&#x27;s razor can be easily stored on the shelf below the mirror. Mirror size is quite adequate and it can be tilted up or down for users of different heights. Well-designed and very useful, especially in a shower without its own lighting.</li>
    <li> The shower mirror is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  You won&#x27;t need another one if you buy this product. Very simple installation process that works well on any shower surface.</li>
    <li> Great love it, If i were you I would buy it.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the mirror has a slight bow to it so if you&#x27;re not right up next to the mirror then the reflection is distorted. Not a huge deal but kind of annoying.&lt;br /&gt;I like the integrated lighting, the method for anti-fog, and the little mount underneath to hold stuff.</li>
