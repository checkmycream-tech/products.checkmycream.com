      <li>A great product at a great price!  </li>
      <li>Product works great.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many products and this one works the best, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Its good but doesnt seem quite Like what I boight from the salon.</li>
      <li>My hair looked healthy and happy.</li>
      <li>Way better than Moroccan oil!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
      <li>This is great to add to the hair either immediately after a shower, or just to smooth out the fly-aways</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried this on it&#x27;s own yet, because I feel like I need Redken to keep the fly aways in check and as a leave in conditioner to my hair, but this has quickly become a must have item in my beauty regime.  </li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful, fresh and clean, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried two dozen argan oils and serums for my hair, and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>very light oil to apply to damp hair..</li>
      <li>both love this oil.  </li>
      <li>even seem more healthy.</li>
      <li>I love this styling product because it&#x27;s multi-faceted.</li>
      <li>I came to Amazon just to see if they carried it and glad to see they do.</li>
      <li>Plus, it has a nice clean smell.</li>
      <li>The Best for fly away hair, gives great shine but only use a few drops or your hair</li>
      <li>I love this oil, it&#x27;s not greasy at all, smells like a fresh frosted cake and works wonders on my hair.</li>
      <li>Shipped as expected and in great condition.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m able to run it through out my hair without having to brush it much like a leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This hair serum really does work magic with your hair and it smells</li>
      <li>I have probably purchased over thirty different kinds of hair shiners and serums over the years and this product is superior</li>
      <li>i have curly hair and it gets super frizzy</li>
      <li>I first crossed paths with AG&#x27;s Organic Argan Oil via a free sample I got a Sephora.</li>
      <li>We started using the same brand&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner because we liked the oil</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, useful product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>It smells lightly of citrus and leaves my hair smooth without weighing it down (I have fine hair, chemically treated).</li>
      <li>but it helps with frizz and helps to smooth out the hair and make it really soft after blow drying!</li>
      <li>This hair oil, has made my hair smooth, soft, stronger and grow.</li>
      <li>I blow dry, then I use a little bit more on my dry hair to restore shine &amp; break up hair for a sculpted piecy look that is touchable, restylable throughout the day all without stickiness &amp; it smells great. :)</li>
      <li>and I must have had 10 people comment on how soft my hair looked the very first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering again very soon just to ensure I do not run out of this product.</li>
      <li>It does tame my hair nicely and I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s small and effective.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend you try this -</li>
      <li>I really like it and makes my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>This makes my hair so soft!  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair soooo soft!</li>
      <li>product packaging itself is pretty simple.</li>
      <li>Make sure to use a small amount</li>
      <li>I had instant positive results</li>
      <li>I use this in combination with Redken&#x27;s Outshine to make my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I have unruly old lady grey wiry hair, this stuff smoothed it out and made it pretty in one application.</li>
      <li>I use it as a hair serum on wet, freshly washed hair.</li>
      <li>It makes my hari calm down with out the grease look.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving it unlocked and then tipping it over before leaving for work (happened with some other products before--not pretty)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It lasts a long time (I only need one or two pumps, which I put in after I blow-dry my hair to where it&#x27;s almost fully dry, put the product in, and throw in another quick blow dry.)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great argan oil! Way better than Moroccan oil! Makes my hair silky and shiny! The seller is great too! Excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> Make sure to use a small amount but it helps with frizz and helps to smooth out the hair and make it really soft after blow drying! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> A great product at a great price!  Shipped as expected and in great condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had tangley hair and now that I highlight it, it&#x27;s even more difficult to manage.  A small amount of this makes my hair much easier to comb through.  I use this in combination with Redken&#x27;s Outshine to make my hair soft and manageable.  I haven&#x27;t tried this on it&#x27;s own yet, because I feel like I need Redken to keep the fly aways in check and as a leave in conditioner to my hair, but this has quickly become a must have item in my beauty regime.  I pump a small amount and smooth it through my half dried hair, focusing on the ends.  I highly recommend you try this - I&#x27;ve tried every serum on the planet and this is one of the best.</li>
    <li> Its good but doesnt seem quite Like what I boight from the salon.</li>
    <li> I have unruly old lady grey wiry hair, this stuff smoothed it out and made it pretty in one application. Awesome sauce!</li>
    <li> This hair serum really does work magic with your hair and it smells devine  I have probably purchased over thirty different kinds of hair shiners and serums over the years and this product is superior</li>
    <li> This hair oil, has made my hair smooth, soft, stronger and grow. My hair went from lifeless to va va va boom!</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful, fresh and clean, not overpowering. I have over processed hair and this stuff is a life saver!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this at Ulta, and since I have very curly crazy Irish/Scotch hair that just loves to frizz, I was hoping this would help. I love this oil, it&#x27;s not greasy at all, smells like a fresh frosted cake and works wonders on my hair. I came to Amazon just to see if they carried it and glad to see they do. However it&#x27;s a little cheaper by about .50 so I wouldn&#x27;t be saving anything for the same size I bought. I recommend this product if you have the problem hair I mentioned. I also use Redken Curvaceous Shampoo and Conditioner and a cream called WAVE by Redken. I don&#x27;t wash my curls everyday but about every third day but in between I rinse my hair and put only two pumps into my wet hair and then air dry it. I have never found anything that holds the curls like this does with no frizz.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair so soft!  I apply it to wet hair before blow drying and add some smoothing cream to finish when styling.  It does a great job and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of products in my hair.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to try this.  My hair is naturally blond, wavy and thick.  It makes my hari calm down with out the grease look.  I really like it and makes my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> The Best for fly away hair, gives great shine but only use a few drops or your hair we be to oily and curls will sag. Plus this product smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick and somewhat wavy hair - it&#x27;s not curly.  My husband also has thick hair, but his is curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both love this oil.  We started using the same brand&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner because we liked the oil so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a three pumps in my hair when wet, starting at the tips and I&#x27;m able to run it through out my hair without having to brush it much like a leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair very soft and manageable without weighing it down or leaving it greasy and I&#x27;ve noticed the tips even seem more healthy.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair which I do highlight.  I absolutely love this product!  ONE drop is all I need for my shoulder length hair.  I had instant positive results and I must have had 10 people comment on how soft my hair looked the very first time I used it.  It will forever be in my beauty musts!</li>
    <li> This is great to add to the hair either immediately after a shower, or just to smooth out the fly-aways</li>
    <li> very light oil to apply to damp hair.. my fav</li>
    <li> Product works great.  Fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> I actually don&#x27;t remember</li>
    <li> I love this styling product because it&#x27;s multi-faceted. I use it as a hair serum on wet, freshly washed hair. I blow dry, then I use a little bit more on my dry hair to restore shine &amp; break up hair for a sculpted piecy look that is touchable, restylable throughout the day all without stickiness &amp; it smells great. :)</li>
    <li> Best for color and damaged hair. Only us just a dab and works and small little bottle will last for months.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing!! i have curly hair and it gets super frizzy this tames it when i blow it out!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair not at all &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; looking, but richer and fuller. Excellent for thinning hair. I just began using it this year and I already swear by it.</li>
    <li> I first crossed paths with AG&#x27;s Organic Argan Oil via a free sample I got a Sephora. You know, the ones they throw in your bag after an online purchase. I took it with me on a trip, leaving my usual hair serumm behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at the difference this made in my hair. My sister even commented that it looked like I just got a \\&quot;blow out\\&quot; at a salon. My hair looked healthy and happy. I even like the smell of it! After using the sample (which lasted a few days) I used the argan oil my sister was using (I don&#x27;t remember the brand she had) and it didn&#x27;t seem to work quite the same, so when I got home, I purchased this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time (I only need one or two pumps, which I put in after I blow-dry my hair to where it&#x27;s almost fully dry, put the product in, and throw in another quick blow dry.) It&#x27;s made a noticeable difference, and I&#x27;ll be getting it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product packaging itself is pretty simple. The oil doesn&#x27;t spill around and I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving it unlocked and then tipping it over before leaving for work (happened with some other products before--not pretty) but I do notice some grease around it, so it&#x27;s not a miracle oil-free packaging. I&#x27;ll take it, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, useful product. It works well, it&#x27;s small and effective. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried two dozen argan oils and serums for my hair, and this is by far the best. It smells lightly of citrus and leaves my hair smooth without weighing it down (I have fine hair, chemically treated). It&#x27;s definitely worth the money. I hope it never goes off the market, because it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve aged, my hair has really gotten brittle and dull.  A friend introduced me to this productl.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it immediately made in the feel and look of my hair.  I will be ordering again very soon just to ensure I do not run out of this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soooo soft!</li>
    <li> Bought this based on some of the reveiws I&#x27;ve read on the internet. It does tame my hair nicely and I&#x27;ll be buying it again. I&#x27;ve used many products and this one works the best, in my opinion. Plus, it has a nice clean smell.</li>
    <li> BEST STUFF EVERY FOR YOUR HAIR!!!</li>
