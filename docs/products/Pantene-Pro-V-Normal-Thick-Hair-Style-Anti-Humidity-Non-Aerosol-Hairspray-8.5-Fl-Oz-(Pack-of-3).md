      <li>I love it!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>for me it&#x27;s the perfect balance of hold vs stiffness.  </li>
      <li>great product, works wonders here in humid Florida!!!</li>
      <li>This is the best hairspray and I have used it for years.  </li>
      <li>For really beautiful, touchable hair that stays where you put it, splurge and use Fekkai.</li>
      <li>Great price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Some are too sticky, some don&#x27;t have good hold.</li>
      <li>This hairspray has a good hold without being crusty.</li>
      <li>If those premises sound good to you, then by all means, give it a try!</li>
      <li>Love my pantene non-aerosol!</li>
      <li>My favorite Hairspray!</li>
      <li>always liked it....</li>
      <li>It has a nice scent as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>nedd 6 more words or&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>This is a great hairspray, it has strong hold without leaving your hair weighted down or tacky.</li>
      <li>this seems to be basically true, but seems the level 3 hold is not as good as the manufacturer&#x27;s former blend of 2-3yrs ago.  </li>
      <li>product arrived fairly quickly...</li>
      <li>The natural waves also lend to \\&quot;poofing\\&quot; (for lack of better term) regardless of length when humidity spikes.  </li>
      <li>Great hold without making hair too too stiff or sticky.</li>
      <li>This was just right.</li>
      <li>You better be SURE your style is the way you want it before using this stuff, because changes are hard.</li>
      <li>Since I like it so much and have been using it for years</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Additionally, if you are not fond of the &amp;#34;helmet&amp;#34; look, all you have to do is gently run your hands over your hair and the product will neutralize, taking away that &#x27;shiny&amp;#34; look.  </li>
      <li>one - get one free sale at Kroger locally, so I&#x27;ve used it all week.</li>
      <li>Really holds my wavy hair in place without being sticky.</li>
      <li>It holds curls or straight hair or fancy hair styles.</li>
      <li>But, so do many othets that are much less</li>
      <li>I highly recommend using this product.</li>
      <li>it lasts all day and adds natural looking shine to hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely been humid, hot and damp here and this spray does hold my hair in place even when outside working with horses.</li>
      <li>one of the hair products that I can&#x27;t live without and find myself stocking up on for the future</li>
      <li>If you have tried every other hair product out there, and your hair still refuses to &amp;#34;do right&amp;#34;, then I highly suggest the pantene pro-v hairspray.  </li>

<li> /curly hair that length helps to weigh down and control somewhat.  </li>
<li> However, as most girls with curly or wavy hair know, humidity plays horrible games with the flyaways and short hairs about forehead, ears and nape.  </li>
<li> With just a small spray of this product, you can style your hair and &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; it just like you want.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very stiff and tacky/sticky feeling for about 15 minutes after using it.</li>
<li> A lot like when I use the less expensive Suave hair spray.</li>
<li> At $20 a can, that stuff is just not suitable for every day use around here!</li>
<li> Buy this product and you won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

    <li> Um, I have hair.  LOTS of it.  Wavy /curly hair that length helps to weigh down and control somewhat.  However, as most girls with curly or wavy hair know, humidity plays horrible games with the flyaways and short hairs about forehead, ears and nape.  The natural waves also lend to \\&quot;poofing\\&quot; (for lack of better term) regardless of length when humidity spikes.  This product does not stop the humidity from causing the curly flyaways in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, it will hold regular style on non -humid days.  So, for hairspray it works.  But, so do many othets that are much less costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For antihumidity product - not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christine</li>
    <li> My favorite Hairspray! it lasts all day and adds natural looking shine to hair. It holds hair neatly without making it look crispy or greasy. It holds curls or straight hair or fancy hair styles. Buy this product and you won&#x27;t go wrong. I love it!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love my pantene non-aerosol!</li>
    <li> my wife uses this product and shes out of the country</li>
    <li> Great hold without making hair too too stiff or sticky.</li>
    <li> This hairspray has a good hold without being crusty.</li>
    <li> Always had a hard time finding it in my local CVS but I can always count on Amazon to have it in stock.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I tried this Pantene hair spray in an effort to find a less expensive option to the Fekkai spray that I love. At $20 a can, that stuff is just not suitable for every day use around here! The Pantene humidity hair spray was on a buy one - get one free sale at Kroger locally, so I&#x27;ve used it all week. It&#x27;s definitely been humid, hot and damp here and this spray does hold my hair in place even when outside working with horses. It has a nice scent as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one star deduction is because unlike the pricey Fekkai, I don&#x27;t dare try brush my hair after spraying it with the Pantene. It&#x27;s very stiff and tacky/sticky feeling for about 15 minutes after using it. You better be SURE your style is the way you want it before using this stuff, because changes are hard. Even after it&#x27;s dry my hair feels stiff to the touch. A lot like when I use the less expensive Suave hair spray. For really beautiful, touchable hair that stays where you put it, splurge and use Fekkai.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Really holds my wavy hair in place without being sticky.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and for me it&#x27;s the perfect balance of hold vs stiffness.  Since I like it so much and have been using it for years........ I&#x27;m waiting for them to discontinue it.  Dear Pantene - please don&#x27;t discontinue this hairspray.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hairspray that would replace a much more expensive brand I had used for years. Some are too sticky, some don&#x27;t have good hold. This was just right.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray and I have used it for years.  Keeps your hair controlled without the helmet head look.</li>
    <li> great product, works wonders here in humid Florida!!!</li>
    <li> Product works well, claims to hold at 3 level for humidity...this seems to be basically true, but seems the level 3 hold is not as good as the manufacturer&#x27;s former blend of 2-3yrs ago.  Would prefer to have a choice of HOLD versus humidity hold only.  Still works with very curly, wavy hair that is hard to manage in high humidity of spring/summer/year round.</li>
    <li> product arrived fairly quickly...one of the hair products that I can&#x27;t live without and find myself stocking up on for the future so I don&#x27;t run out</li>
    <li> always liked it....could not always find it in stores&lt;br /&gt;great value....would recommend to others....nedd 6 more words or&lt;br /&gt;wont accept....done</li>
    <li> If you have tried every other hair product out there, and your hair still refuses to &amp;#34;do right&amp;#34;, then I highly suggest the pantene pro-v hairspray.  With just a small spray of this product, you can style your hair and &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; it just like you want.  Additionally, if you are not fond of the &amp;#34;helmet&amp;#34; look, all you have to do is gently run your hands over your hair and the product will neutralize, taking away that &#x27;shiny&amp;#34; look.  If those premises sound good to you, then by all means, give it a try!</li>
    <li> This is a great hairspray, it has strong hold without leaving your hair weighted down or tacky. I highly recommend using this product. Great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have used this hairspray for years.  It&#x27;s the only spray that last and holds my hair.</li>
