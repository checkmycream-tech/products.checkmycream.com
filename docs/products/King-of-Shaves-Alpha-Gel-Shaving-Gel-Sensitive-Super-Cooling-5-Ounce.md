      <li>My favorite shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Remington&#x27;s Shave Gel and the King of Shave&#x27;s equivalent for many years now.</li>
      <li>My husband and I both use it and both love it.  </li>
      <li>King of Shaves is a bit more costly than most canned shaving creams &amp; gels, but it is more than worth it.</li>
      <li>Very convenient to order here, good price.</li>
      <li>It does have a strong menthol smell that almost opens your sinuses.</li>

      <li>This stuff makes my skin feel as smooth as your wife&#x27;s bottom</li>

      <li>Order arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
      <li>There is a mild, pleasant smell to the shaving gel, and my face has always been smoother with this gel than any other!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be the 2nd best way to wet shave.  </li>
      <li>but it was too slimy feeling for me and clogged up the razor more frequently.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used super expensive boutique gels, run of the mill drugstore creams and all, and this is the best.  </li>
      <li>It is just that KMF is the most diluted of the three and does not create the same level of slickness as the others.</li>
      <li>Another plus: this gel is low foam, which means I could easily see my face and exactly where I was shaving at all times.</li>
      <li>makes shaving comfortable and it last forever.  </li>
      <li>It really makes your face feel refreshed.</li>
      <li>Not one nick, and King of Shaves left my face smooth and moisturized.</li>
      <li>No messy lather!  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this product in any store near me</li>
      <li>The only reason it gets 2nd place it because even though it shaves almost as good in every way, I still get cuts with the King of Shaves where I don&#x27;t with Save Secret.  </li>
      <li>Recently I decides to try something new</li>
      <li>High glide coefficient with minimal cleanup after.  </li>

    <li> I really love how this gel lathers! I had a really thick amount of facial hair the other day, &amp; I am sure I used no more than a quarter size amount. I had to go over my thick facial hair several times, but that small amount sure did the job. I had to add water to my face and the gel would relather! Not one nick, and King of Shaves left my face smooth and moisturized. There is a mild, pleasant smell to the shaving gel, and my face has always been smoother with this gel than any other! Another plus: this gel is low foam, which means I could easily see my face and exactly where I was shaving at all times. King of Shaves is a bit more costly than most canned shaving creams &amp; gels, but it is more than worth it. I have had no skin irritation at all! Highly recommended!! :D</li>
    <li> I only use this shave gel! I really enjoy the ritual of shaving so I searched and searched for a great shave cream or gel. Came across this about 10 years ago and I haven&#x27;t used anything else since. I can&#x27;t find it in stores often so when I ran out in the past I have tried expensive shaving products only to be disappointed. Found this on Amazon for an incredible price so I never run out now. Definitely a King of Shaves.</li>
    <li> This gel provides great protection and you don&#x27;t need very much of it so it should last.</li>
    <li> The best shave gel I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington&#x27;s Shave Gel and the King of Shave&#x27;s equivalent for many years now. Recently I decides to try something new so I bought some KMF and also the Cremo Shave Cream. My personal experience is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KMF &#x3D; Good&lt;br /&gt;Remington/KoS &#x3D; Better&lt;br /&gt;Cremo &#x3D; Best&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though that all of these provide a quality shave. It is just that KMF is the most diluted of the three and does not create the same level of slickness as the others.</li>
    <li> this is the best shave gel on market.  makes shaving comfortable and it last forever.  great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard and shave with a Norelco wet/dry electric razor. I never used a shaving gel before now but will use this product from now on. It gives the closeness of a blade razor in half the time and hassle and leaves your face feeling great without a strong smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin feel as smooth as your wife&#x27;s bottom</li>
    <li> Smooth shave with a soothing aloe gel.  No razor burn.</li>
    <li> Gums up my wet dry electric razor but works well otherwise</li>
    <li> My husband likes this as well as more expensive ones, and finds it much easier to use than the hard shaving soaps.</li>
    <li> No messy lather!  Just use a small dab.  One tube lasts months!  Great product!</li>
    <li> My favorite shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I use this with an electric razor in the shower and it works great.</li>
    <li> This shave gel works great.  My husband and I both use it and both love it.  I&#x27;ve used super expensive boutique gels, run of the mill drugstore creams and all, and this is the best.  IT doesn&#x27;t foam up, but you can tell where it is, and it&#x27;s super smooth.  I have very sensitive/dry skin and love this for shaving my legs.  My husband has average skin and uses it on his face, of course, without any problems.  It lasts forever, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  We stock up every time we find it on sale.</li>
    <li> I bought this product since I saw it on a youtube razor review.  I&#x27;ve found it to be the 2nd best way to wet shave.  To me, Save Secret (http://amzn.to/1KGH8zC) is the King with King of Shaves gel just below.  The only reason it gets 2nd place it because even though it shaves almost as good in every way, I still get cuts with the King of Shaves where I don&#x27;t with Save Secret.  The only plus King of Shaves has over SaveSecret is the razor rinses off easier.  I find you have to really work to rinse the razor when using Save Secret.</li>
    <li> Best shaving gel I&#x27;ve ever used. I love that it doesn&#x27;t lather and yet a small, thin layer goes a long way. I&#x27;m left without razor burn every time. Amazing. Plus, cleanup is a cinch versus regular shaving creams/gels!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I can&#x27;t imagine shaving with anything else again. It does have a strong menthol smell that almost opens your sinuses. I happen to like that. It really makes your face feel refreshed. It has helped to lessen razor burn.</li>
    <li> The best affordable shave gel on the market!!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t for me but I have been using creams and gels for close to 40 years.  It smells good and I liked the tingle but it was too slimy feeling for me and clogged up the razor more frequently.</li>
    <li> Makes a great companion with my Norelco 6400.  High glide coefficient with minimal cleanup after.  Nice smell and tea tree oil ingredient.  I follow up with &amp;#34;Gold Bond Men&#x27;s Everyday Essentials Lotion, 14.5 Ounce&amp;#34; afterwards.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Have been using it for years.  Order arrived quickly and as described.  Would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Best shave gel I have used. I have been using this since the last 10 years. Times I am forced to use the like of Gillette gives me the shudders. The smoothest glide for the blade. Has increased the longevity of the blades I use. The most awesome combination is King of Shaves shave oil and this gel. I would not go back to any other shave gel.</li>
    <li> This is very good shave gel! Works great for me as I shave in the shower. Good mentholatum smell that clears nasal passages to boot, cool and tingly. Very convenient to order here, good price. I can&#x27;t find this product in any store near me so it suits me.</li>
