      <li>I love lavender, so</li>
      <li>She scratched the overwrapping and was in love...</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought this was actually the liquid kind (or pseudo liquid?), so it&#x27;s mostly my fault here for ordering wrong type. Very pleasant scent, and has been a go-to deoderant for me for years! This kind may leave a slight residue since it&#x27;s the solid variety. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble so far!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product it is amazing. The smell is really really good. its a good buy and its really really really really long lasting.</li>
    <li> It smells great, stays on all day. It been 3 months and I am now on my second deodorant;they last a long time.</li>
    <li> This smells soooo good but I did discover that the gel works so much better than the roll on solids.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and lasts all day long. Great price too! What more can you ask for? Will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
    <li> Great price for a three pack and it smells really good too.  Nice for an every day deoderant and plenty to have for later.</li>
    <li> Not something I&#x27;ll buy again. Doesn&#x27;t hold sweat. Doesn&#x27;t keep you fresh. Don&#x27;t recommend buying this. Not worth it. Don&#x27;t know what else to say</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male and I&#x27;ve always appreciated the secret brand, usually the powder scent, over any deodorant made for a man.  For me it seems to keep you drier, and scent is softer and more obscure.  I gave these a try and they work just as good as I anticipated.  They smell great, it feels smooth instead of dry or overly wet.  Would definitely purchase again, maybe in another scent just to give them a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve we always used Secret.  Worked for me.  I love lavender, so when I saw this, it was perfect.  Works good and smells wonderful.  Good deal too.  I have an extra to put in the rv and another on hand.</li>
    <li> Deodorant is one thing you want to make sure to not run out of. Love that this great product is available on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and it was perfect! On the outside box, there is a scratch &amp; sniff of the scent(lavendar) and it smells DELICIOUS! This is a winner for that hard to get person! She scratched the overwrapping and was in love...Not only that ,but she immediately scooped up the contents and difiantly mutters MINE!!  Thats a winner...Yay! PS.Happy days are here again...  AF.</li>
    <li> I love secret deodrant gel and thought i would try this . It is awful . The first one i opened the roller broke so was unable to use</li>
    <li> After one use of this product i noticed that my underarms were starting to get red, WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! the only scent from secret that did not give me an awful reaction is the vanilla...its time to go back to that one.</li>
    <li> i used to it its perfect i recommended to everyone so go for it to buy these stuff its worth it</li>
    <li> What a buy! No more going to the store! The price is right and I am stocked with my favorite deodorant!</li>
    <li> I prefer the Secret gel because of the white residue with the solid deodorants.  The smell is pleasant, but not overpowering.</li>

    <li> Second order.  Works and smells great.</li>
    <li> I normally order the clear gel Secret Scent but I was pleasantly surprised that this one works just as well and love the smell of the lavender.</li>
    <li> The scent is not overbearing.  It is my favorite scent so far.  Good price.  I will continue to buy this product</li>
    <li> This deodorant works great, and although the scent is nothing like lavender, it still smells very nice. Not too strong. It&#x27;s also nice to get the 4-pack, and have a supply for awhile.</li>

    <li> This is amazing I sweat very easily like literally when I get out of the tub thirty minute later im musty but this lasted me all day long with no scent of must but of a nice lavender smell omg so amazing.</li>

    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMAÑO  LOS FELICITO POR PRESENTAR PRODUCTOS DE ESTA CALIDAD JSIUDIUDF IYDFIUYF</li>
    <li> Great deal for three! I love the scent, and it doesn&#x27;t let me sweat! Works great! Shhh it&#x27;s a secret!</li>
    <li> I prefer to buy toiletries in bulk on Amazon as it saves $$$! I love this brand, this is my favorite scent--slightly girly and floral, but muted so it&#x27;s great for everyday wear--I figured why not. Packaging was great, fast shipping, I&#x27;ll absolutely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Lon lasting, clean fresh scent.  Keeps you dry and feeling great all day.  I recommend to anyone on the go or stay at home kind of girl.</li>
