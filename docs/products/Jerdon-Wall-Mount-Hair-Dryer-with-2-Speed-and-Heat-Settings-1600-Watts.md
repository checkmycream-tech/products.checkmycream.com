### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a great idea for all home beautification!!</li>
      <li>Installed a year ago and still working great!</li>
      <li>Love it!!!!</li>
      <li>Excellent choice for our guest bath.  </li>
      <li>works great but would have preferred a coiled cord</li>
      <li>Works and looks good.  </li>
      <li>This fit the bill perfectly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Summary: I would be happy to pay more for a dryer that works, looks and functions as well, but lasts longer.</li>
      <li>Now I have my own, conveniently hung at the side of  my sink.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll need your own screw</li>
      <li>The cord kind of gets in the way, though.</li>
      <li>A nice hairdryer, it does what we need.</li>
      <li>A great gift for the friend getting married or for the graduate!!</li>
      <li>It really works great and she couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product</li>
      <li>It was good for quickly drying my hair, but would leave my hair frizzy sometimes and was a pain for styling.</li>
      <li>Ordered this one , got it fast , just what we wrer looking for great vender</li>
      <li>I am pleased</li>
      <li>I love this blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I mostly used it when traveling.</li>
      <li>I was able to return it for a refund but the cost to repost it was more than triple the cost of the product.</li>
      <li>If I can keep it from sucking in my hair into the backside of it and singeing it, I would be okay.  </li>
      <li>After two-years, it&#x27;s still working great and gets a decent amount of use.</li>
      <li>They work great and WOW what a deal i got on them...</li>
      <li>Easy installation.</li>
      <li>For someone with shorter hair this dryer would probably be fine.</li>
      <li>Nice design, gets the dryer off the counter, dryer works very well, and is lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>The unit did not have a night light which i need and it did not have a cord holder which I require</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the person that designed it has to either use it or clean a bathroom.  </li>
      <li>I mostly purchased this for when the girls are at the house and need a hairdryer, but it&#x27;s actually come in handy for me as well.</li>
      <li>it does slop around on the counter top a bit, but you really need that to have a comfortable amount of distance to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m very into more modern looking gadgets and the compactness of this and sleek black made it a great fit.</li>
      <li>Drys quickly and does not get too hot.  </li>
      <li>It is a perfect size for any bathroom (we bought a white one for one bathroom and this black for another).</li>
      <li>I guess that three years is probably not terrible for the life of a hair dryer, but for something used less than five minutes a day my wife was expecting better.</li>
      <li>I was genuinely suprised by how much power it really has.  </li>
      <li>This little dryer looks good on the wall and frees up my counter space.</li>
      <li>You see these at the better motels but dont find them at the big box stores , my wife wanted this in her bathroom at home.</li>
      <li>We certainly will not be replacing it with a like unit.</li>
      <li>Added a third one to my daughters room to free up the bathroom.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes to use this dryer.</li>
      <li>Worked very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Tracked</li>
      <li>I got a pro-versa instead of jerdon,amazon says pro-versa makes jerdon,no speeds or heat settings,just on and off button,unfortunately its already  on wall,did not notice til after,heck of a time putting it up also, very difficult,will not buy again</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s on the wall, out of the way and always ready.</li>
      <li>Guests love the fact that they don&#x27;t have to drag along a hair dryer when they visit.</li>
      <li>Small and very powerful drys hair very quickly</li>
      <li>Love it other than the cord that is not coiled</li>
      <li>This little wall hair dryer does the job, it&#x27;s up out of the way, yet easy to grab and go to drying!  </li>
      <li>Bought again because its convenient and has decent power.</li>
      <li>That said, I still highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>This little dryer is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It keeps things at easy reach without falling all over the place when we&#x27;re moving, or taking up the minimal cupboard space in an RV!    </li>
      <li>It would have been nice if they could have made it retractable, or at least spirally (like phone cords used to be).</li>
      <li>I researched various black on-wall hairdryers and I liked that this one was compact and</li>
      <li>The only thing I would change is to make the power cord recoil as it is nice and long, but must be wrapped up after each use or left to hang.</li>
      <li>This hairdryer is much more powerful than the Conair I previously owned as it dries my hair in nearly half the time.</li>
      <li>I  just love this blow dryer i got 3 of them for my house in black and 2 in white for my condo at the beach..</li>
      <li>I buy one of these wall mount dryers every time my old dryer is exhausted.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is a tiny bit quieter, but still makes a decent amount of noise (about the same as a powerful hand vacuum).</li>
      <li>Not surprising since it only had two settings: kinda powerful and very powerful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small, powerful, and easily mounted in the tight space I had reserved for it.  </li>
      <li>This little blowdryer is quite powerful.  </li>
      <li>First one lasted 27.5 months used an average of 1.5 times/day.  </li>
      <li>About a year ago it began making an extra noise when it was infrequently switched to high speed, so she really limited that use.</li>

    <li> This little dryer is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Small and very powerful drys hair very quickly</li>
    <li> This little blowdryer is quite powerful.  I was genuinely suprised by how much power it really has.  Drys quickly and does not get too hot.  Love it other than the cord that is not coiled like it indicates in the picture.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is much more powerful than the Conair I previously owned as it dries my hair in nearly half the time.

    <li> [[ASIN:B000X300MC Jerdon JHD41B Wall Mount Hair Dryer with 2-Speed and Heat Settings, 1600-Watts, Black Finish]]&lt;br /&gt;After only one year of use it will no longer dry on high only on warm---useless now!</li>
    <li> I  just love this blow dryer i got 3 of them for my house in black and 2 in white for my condo at the beach..They work great and WOW what a deal i got on them...</li>
    <li> If I can keep it from sucking in my hair into the backside of it and singeing it, I would be okay.  I hope to figure it out soon.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it does dry hair.</li>
    <li> Works and looks good.  You&#x27;ll need your own screw though cause the screws to mount it to the wall are specialty screws that you won&#x27;t have the bit to unless your garage has every tool known to man!</li>
    <li> I researched various black on-wall hairdryers and I liked that this one was compact and a cord that seemed like it would stay out of the way. I mostly purchased this for when the girls are at the house and need a hairdryer, but it&#x27;s actually come in handy for me as well. Anyway, mount and forget this thing. The cord for how I mounted it does slop around on the counter top a bit, but you really need that to have a comfortable amount of distance to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m very into more modern looking gadgets and the compactness of this and sleek black made it a great fit. After two-years, it&#x27;s still working great and gets a decent amount of use. No problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I always wanted one of those hair dryers like in a hotel. Now I have my own, conveniently hung at the side of  my sink. Plenty of power for drying hair. Easy installation.</li>
    <li> This little dryer looks good on the wall and frees up my counter space. The cord kind of gets in the way, though. It would have been nice if they could have made it retractable, or at least spirally (like phone cords used to be). And unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have as much power as I&#x27;m used to. When I&#x27;m in a hurry I still pull out my big old gun-style dryer, which does the job on my long hair in about half the time. For someone with shorter hair this dryer would probably be fine.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer fills the bill to a tee.  It is small, but yet it performs just as well as the former larger unit.</li>
    <li> This little wall hair dryer does the job, it&#x27;s up out of the way, yet easy to grab and go to drying!  It&#x27;s just a great idea for all home beautification!! I have very thick hair and I&#x27;m done in around 5-7 minutes.  A great gift for the friend getting married or for the graduate!!</li>
    <li> The non-retractable, uncoiled cord on this wall mounted dryer is always in the way.  It is a royal pain.  i would not order this blow dryer again because of the cord.  This is just plain bad engineering, if you ask me.  I don&#x27;t think the person that designed it has to either use it or clean a bathroom.  Just doesn&#x27;t make sense.</li>
    <li> works great but would have preferred a coiled cord</li>
    <li> It gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in an effort to organize the bathroom in my motorhome.  It keeps things at easy reach without falling all over the place when we&#x27;re moving, or taking up the minimal cupboard space in an RV!    It definitely satisfies all my criteria.  It&#x27;s small, powerful, and easily mounted in the tight space I had reserved for it.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this dryer to anyone, and especially to anyone looking to organize a bathroom that might be somewhat spacially-challenged!</li>
    <li> I buy one of these wall mount dryers every time my old dryer is exhausted.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday and it lasts a long time before replacing it.  I am pleased&lt;br /&gt;with its durability.</li>
    <li> Update...The hair dryer slowly died after one year of use. Not surprising since it only had two settings: kinda powerful and very powerful. It was good for quickly drying my hair, but would leave my hair frizzy sometimes and was a pain for styling. I mostly used it when traveling. I was also never happy with the plastic wall mount because it cracked and the hair dryer sometimes falls out.</li>
    <li> having no coiled cord is mildly  inconvenient and possibly unsafe as this item is often mounted near a bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> Pros: Nice design, gets the dryer off the counter, dryer works very well, and is lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: They don&#x27;t last very long.  I&#x27;ve had 2 of these: First one lasted 27.5 months used an average of 1.5 times/day.  Second one only lasted 22 months with same use frequency.  I&#x27;ve had other blow dryers last 10+ years, so its annoying that this product does not last.  The fan blades inside the dryer are made of very thin plastic, and they eventually just disintegrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: I would be happy to pay more for a dryer that works, looks and functions as well, but lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer. I wanted one I didn&#x27;t have to put away every day or have lying around with the cord all bunched up. This fit the bill perfectly. It&#x27;s on the wall, out of the way and always ready.</li>
    <li> You see these at the better motels but dont find them at the big box stores , my wife wanted this in her bathroom at home. Ordered this one , got it fast , just what we wrer looking for great vender</li>
    <li> My wife really likes to use this dryer. It really works great and she couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product</li>
    <li> The unit did not have a night light which i need and it did not have a cord holder which I require</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the dryer cord plugs into the wall.  My last wall mounted dryer had a separate power cord from the wall mount.  Just note this if your mounting the dryer and your electrical outlet isn&#x27;t close by.  Otherwise, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Came across dryer in hotel.  Worked very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Tracked it down oniine.  It worked for about a year . ..</li>
    <li> Has held up well in my rental condo! Installed a year ago and still working great! I would reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 of these for a couple of years. The one that is used by 3 people daily finally went. Bought again because its convenient and has decent power. Added a third one to my daughters room to free up the bathroom.</li>
    <li> A nice hairdryer, it does what we need. We were disappointed that there was no out of the way storage for any  excess power cord and that the power cord was not coiled to reduce the length of usable cord.&lt;br /&gt;It is now three years later, and I must revise this review. I guess that three years is probably not terrible for the life of a hair dryer, but for something used less than five minutes a day my wife was expecting better. About a year ago it began making an extra noise when it was infrequently switched to high speed, so she really limited that use. Anyhow, right at the three year anniversary of its first usage, the propeller&lt;br /&gt;blades disintegrated and jammed the motor causing it to begin smoking and smelling really bad before she could get the plug pulled. We certainly will not be replacing it with a like unit.</li>
    <li> I got a pro-versa instead of jerdon,amazon says pro-versa makes jerdon,no speeds or heat settings,just on and off button,unfortunately its already  on wall,did not notice til after,heck of a time putting it up also, very difficult,will not buy again</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. Australian power outlets are different to this product. I was able to return it for a refund but the cost to repost it was more than triple the cost of the product. I was only being re embersed for a minimal amount. Where is the product?? on the rubbish shelf in the shed. Would not purchase again.</li>
