      <li>I highly recommend this product to any one who is considering trying it.</li>
      <li>I highly recomend this product.</li>
      <li>The smell of the product is intensely perfume-laden (a no-no for sensitive skin).  </li>
      <li>but many not have used long enough to see results.</li>
      <li>The wash calmed redness in my face and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin as quickly, though I&#x27;m still mindful.</li>
      <li>Have very sensitive skin and rosacea.  </li>
      <li>skin is very sensitive.</li>

      <li>I like it, makes my skin soft!</li>
      <li>I use this all the time and it leaves my skin feeling soft.  </li>
      <li>I like to follow with Sebamed moisturizer for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>My skin is extremely sensitive to breakouts though</li>
      <li>She has a little bit of redness around her nose and this helped lessen that, along with leaving clean skin.</li>

<li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry or anything like that</li>
<li> and I can even use it on my dry eczema</li>
<li> I have extremely sensitive skin that is also very acne prone, and this is one of the few face washes that actually balances out my difficult to treat skin.</li>
<li> Cleans but doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin!</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> and you&#x27;ve tried every other cleanser (Cetaphil, Cerave, etc) and nothing else has worked then give this one a try.</li>
<li> This doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other cleansers but it gets the job done.</li>
<li> But unfortunately it is so heavily perfumed that I don&#x27;t think I can keep using it anymore.</li>
<li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so heavily fragranced, it just isn&#x27;t necessary and can be irritating.</li>
<li> After using Sebamed for the past couple of months, I can&#x27;t use any other soap!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for multiple 1-week long stents, and am very unhappy with the results.</li>
<li> Once you start using this liquid soap it will be hard to ever use another soap or body wash.</li>
<li> It makes her skin soft and with the ph balance, she no longer itches so badly.</li>
<li> However, I have been having sensitivity with sulfates in body washes lately</li>
<li> As someone who has suffered with ridiculous allergies and &amp;#34;mysterious&amp;#34; symptoms, this brand has been a miracle.</li>
<li> I have psoriasis, so a lot of body washes just make my skin dry and painful.  </li>
<li> The smell is not great</li>
<li> This is one of the worst products I&#x27;ve tried for my eczema - leaves me reaching for topical steroids to reduce the inflammation and pain.  </li>
<li> Sadly, it smells so terrible (reminiscent of bug spray) that I had to wash my face again to remove the fragrance and get the bottle out of my house.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not saying that is a bad thing.  </li>
<li> I use this brand for shampoo as well as for lip balm, and have never been disappointed!</li>
<li> But I use it for my face, and it tastes really bad!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used the soap before and it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this for a while and swears by it. She has a little bit of redness around her nose and this helped lessen that, along with leaving clean skin. She did notice she needed a bit of moisturizer though and purchased the same brand/type. The combination is prefect and she is pretty religious about using it. Highly recommend, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST face wash for those occasional  zit dots that can show up on your face from time to time! If I use it regularly  totally zit free!!! 5 stars! 3rd bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Germany and I used this product as a teenager over there. Still the same fresh smell and great for sensitive skin. The only downside is the too high cost</li>
    <li> I have been using this for my face almost two years now and I&#x27;m very happy!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry or anything like that and it is very mild.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews that this was good for sensitive skin.  I have psoriasis, so a lot of body washes just make my skin dry and painful.  This body wash works really well.  It suds up very nicely on a bath puff, and makes my skin feel clean without drying it out.  I have no used it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the smell.  I really don&#x27;t like it.  It&#x27;s not a natural smell, at all.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser. it&#x27;s the right pH and I feel like it helps with acne. However, I have been having sensitivity with sulfates in body washes lately so I&#x27;ve been looking for a budget friendly alternative that I can use on my face as well as my body. This doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other cleansers but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I love this brand. As someone who has suffered with ridiculous allergies and &amp;#34;mysterious&amp;#34; symptoms, this brand has been a miracle. The wash calmed redness in my face and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin as quickly, though I&#x27;m still mindful. It also helped to heal the acne that had begun to appear. I use this brand for shampoo as well as for lip balm, and have never been disappointed!</li>
    <li> The smell is very medicinal.  I do not have problem skin so I cannot comment on that. They should remove the fragrance.</li>
    <li> After using Sebamed for the past couple of months, I can&#x27;t use any other soap! I love my Sebamed!!</li>
    <li> I purchased Sebamed based on a recommendation from a friend who swore that it would resolve my eczema (as it did for her brother).  I&#x27;ve tried this product for multiple 1-week long stents, and am very unhappy with the results. Sebamed exacerbates my dishydrotic eczema, gives my skin a burning sensation, and causes my skin to swell up.  The smell of the product is intensely perfume-laden (a no-no for sensitive skin).  This is one of the worst products I&#x27;ve tried for my eczema - leaves me reaching for topical steroids to reduce the inflammation and pain.  It&#x27;s simply a cheap, fragrant SLS soap that is pH balanced for skin that will make you feel like you are bathing in dish soap.</li>
    <li> Great product, leaves my skin feeling soft , in addition to clearing up acne.</li>
    <li> Cleansed well and left my face without a residue like some cleaners do. But something in it broke me out. My skin is extremely sensitive to breakouts though so probably not necessarily Sebameds fault!</li>
    <li> item came as described</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this at Costco and really liked it.  Nice fresh smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> In my opinion nothing better as a face wash.  Fragrance free PH balanced and non clogging.  Leaves everything if washes residue free and simply clean.  This works every bit as good as stuff costing 2X the cost.  Buy one, wash your parts and you will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good product, however overpriced. Smells great, rinses clean with no residue. Has not helped with acne on back and arms yet but many not have used long enough to see results. Will likely buy again but from a drug store where the same size is only $7.99</li>
    <li> Great Face &amp; Body Wash...and great to see a neutral PH for something we use everyday.</li>
    <li> Have very sensitive skin and rosacea.  Tried this as a body wash, not on my face. Made my skin red and itchy.</li>
    <li> I like it, makes my skin soft! Has a refreshing scent.I highly recommend this product to any one who is considering trying it.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so heavily fragranced, it just isn&#x27;t necessary and can be irritating.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and it leaves my skin feeling soft.  Great for the shower.</li>
    <li> But I use it for my face, and it tastes really bad!!  I know I&#x27;m not supposed to eat the stuff, but it gets in the corners of your mouth and you can taste it.  yuck!!  As for a body wash?  It really doesn&#x27;t lather much.  I&#x27;m not saying that is a bad thing.  Just an observation.  I prefer lather</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. My face never felt better.</li>
    <li> Nice and light with a clean sent.</li>
    <li> I love this Sebamed Body Wash.  It is perfect for my super sensitive skin and I can even use it on my dry eczema/hives it is so gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I will only use Sebamed for now, since it is helping all of my skin conditions .....period!</li>
    <li> Wish they had a fragrance-free version of this face wash. I have extremely sensitive skin that is also very acne prone, and this is one of the few face washes that actually balances out my difficult to treat skin. But unfortunately it is so heavily perfumed that I don&#x27;t think I can keep using it anymore. If you have problem skin and you&#x27;ve tried every other cleanser (Cetaphil, Cerave, etc) and nothing else has worked then give this one a try. But if you are sensitive to strong scents like I am then you may find that you don&#x27;t like this one either.</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent body wash if you have sensitive skin.  After using you feel clean without any product build up.  I like to follow with Sebamed moisturizer for sensitive skin.  I have tried all sorts of body washes ans nothing compares with this stuff.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great body wash for the entire family.  Cleans but doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin! Very effective if you live in a cold or a dry climate. Great in the winter however I use it year around!</li>
    <li> I have rosacia. Sebamed was recomended to me by my aunt. I have to say that it does as much or more than the prescription stuff to regulate my skin tone. With regular use, I no longer get as red and my skin feels wonderful. I use the whole line of sebamed products, and I also use it on my 86-year-old mother-in-law. It makes her skin soft and with the ph balance, she no longer itches so badly. I highly recomend this product.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTE BEST for sensitive skin... My teenage daughters who have acne love it too!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s one of the best body wash out there</li>
    <li> Good product with prompt delivery</li>
    <li> Excellent wash solution without the ill effects of soap.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Have been using it for years and will keep on using it!</li>
    <li> Once you start using this liquid soap it will be hard to ever use another soap or body wash.</li>
    <li> I have used this &amp; the olive oil. I use it every night. I use it also to take off my make-up. Love this. The smell is not great but it definitely works with my eczema.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of gently cleaning skin without drying.  Sadly, it smells so terrible (reminiscent of bug spray) that I had to wash my face again to remove the fragrance and get the bottle out of my house.  That&#x27;s a shame, because otherwise, it seems like a decent product.</li>
