      <li>This stuff was amazing!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dove post-shave balm and I&#x27;ve been very happy with its performance, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what I&#x27;d think of this alternative from Nivea.  </li>

      <li>Just love it....</li>
      <li>balm is nice and cool on the skin.</li>
      <li>One caveat though, the scent is a bit too strong, and putting this on your face, so close to your nose is quite overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>and it made his skin nice and smooth and cool after shaving.  </li>
      <li>Use this with some tallow based shaving soap (Tabac is great here on Amazon, or try Barrister and Mann for a non-Amazon artisanal product) and then put on some Aveeno for a moisturizer, and you will have a smooth, comfortable, and cheap shave!hly recommended as a cheap effective and pleasant way to calm and cool your sensitive skinned face after a shave.</li>
      <li>all are a nice, smooth non-creasy lotion that dries rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>very effective after shave for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The cream came out easily from the jar.</li>
      <li>you can easily overdo it by applying too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still as effective now as it was when I first tried it out.</li>
      <li>I noticed the scent and it seemed pretty powerful, surprisingly so for a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; balm, but it wasn&#x27;t repulsively so.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and does a nice job of cooling skin down after a shave.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Highly recommended as a cheap effective and pleasant way to calm and cool your sensitive skinned face after a shave.</li>
      <li>This works and makes his skin really smooth.</li>
      <li>My face felt smooth for hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a genuinely great product that hydrates your face well after you&#x27;ve shaved and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a pick up artist skulking around an Italian disco somewhere.</li>
      <li>Overall, a great post shave balm that gives your skin a smoother  and calming feeling</li>
      <li>Just on a whim, I used it on my legs after shaving because for some reason, I experience a light burning sensation followed by a light rash every time I shave my legs.</li>
      <li>This product greatly reduced the pain associated with razor bumps after facial shaving (my husband).</li>
      <li>Nivea Sensitive Shaving balm (non-cooling) has always been an example of good bang for the buck in shaving balms.</li>
      <li>It will be great if the manufacturers can tone down the scent a bit or better yet, offer an unscented version.  </li>
      <li>I we excited to try Nivea balm for its cooling and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, feels cool and prevents razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>I find the scent pleasant but too strong, and the scent lasts too long.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>I like this more than Cool Water because it doesn&#x27;t burn and actually very comforting like what a lotion does.  </li>
      <li>Feels great after a wet shave.  </li>
      <li>I apply this product in a smooth even layer on my freshly shaven skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice because I&#x27;m a working professional and not everyone likes the odor of &amp;#34;wild musk&amp;#34; in a crowded meeting room at 8:30 am.</li>
      <li>True to form, this is just like all the ones by this brand I tried before.</li>
      <li>This product is a combination of Davidoff Cool Water scent after shave with comfort of Nivea lotion.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice product and for guys who have sensitive skin, this might be the answer.</li>
      <li>just don&#x27;t feel the cool or the soothe.</li>
      <li>All the burning of the shaving stopped and it had a cool feeling</li>
      <li>It was surprisingly soothing and also helped the red go away fro</li>
      <li>Nivea Men&#x27;s Post Shave Balm is a nice, soothing balm treatment for your sensitive, or insensitive, face after shaving.  </li>
      <li>, I just LOVE the way it feels after a very close shave.</li>
      <li>but it fades quickly.</li>
      <li>Now this balm doesn&#x27;t have a lotion feel and does adsorb fairly quickly into the skin once rubbed in.</li>
      <li>I only know because I remarked to her that since this has no smell I was lucky to be able to still add my favorite cologne and not worry about messing up it&#x27;s smell with this added to it.</li>
      <li>It also works much better than costly all organic formulas, such as Pacific Shaving Company&#x27;s Caffeinated after shave (close to 80% more) and Body Shop&#x27;s Razor Relief (close to 3 times the price.)</li>
      <li>He said he liked it because the scent does not interfere with his regular cologne or after shave scents.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the buy.</li>
      <li>This product comes in a nice solid glass bottles with a lid that locks into place.</li>
      <li>I used this balm right after I shaved</li>
      <li>I guess, is priced right</li>
      <li>It had a very slight pleasant scent that once it absorbed into the skin, it went away.  </li>
      <li>It does have a scent that is initially very noticeable but seems to dissipate rather quickly after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m more inclined to reach right for a daily moisturizer with a sun block component, skipping a shaving-specific balm.</li>
      <li>It makes my face feel soft, smooth and hydrated.  </li>
      <li>First off this balm is in a glass container</li>
      <li>Upon application it feels slightly cold, but in a good way, before turning towards a more comfortable warmth.  </li>
      <li>He does have sensitive skin and often gets light rashes after shaving.</li>
      <li>This also makes the Dove balm easier to apply consistently.</li>
      <li>So as I mentioned, it is great with NO alcohol like all the others I have bought, neutral smell at least to ME alone</li>
      <li>especially given the fact that for many people, 1/2 the point of after-shave is for the scent.  </li>
      <li>His skin felt smooth and soft to me</li>
      <li>(it has gotten better over the last week).  </li>
      <li>Now the only concern I have with this shaving balm is the strong smell right off the bat but does wear off over time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband is not one for lotions or anything greasy on his face but i made him try this and he said he liked it.  It had a very slight pleasant scent that once it absorbed into the skin, it went away.  He said it was not greasy and absorbed almost instantly and it made his skin nice and smooth and cool after shaving.  I thought i woudl try it after shaving my legs and I enjoyed it too.  It left my skin feeling very soft.  I know it&#x27;s not the intent of the product but I wanted to give it a try and figure if it works on the tough skin on my legs, then I can give it a true review.  It&#x27;s a nice product and for guys who have sensitive skin, this might be the answer.</li>
    <li> I got a chance to check out this post shaving lotion for a week before I decided to give some feedback about this product. First off this balm is in a glass container and I was surprised about that. I used this balm right after I shaved and it does have some slight cooling feeling once used. Now this balm doesn&#x27;t have a lotion feel and does adsorb fairly quickly into the skin once rubbed in. Now the only concern I have with this shaving balm is the strong smell right off the bat but does wear off over time.</li>
    <li> What is the point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most men probably use a number of different toiletries every day. If every one of those items has added scent, you could walk around smelling like a perfume bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to get everything unscented because I don&#x27;t want to have all of these scents lingering on me all day long and the scents very often smell artificial. I get headaches if a perfume bomb is constantly assaulting me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nivea Men Sensitive Cooling Post Shave Balm is scented, pretty heavily, so I would not buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But does it sooth after a shave? I honestly didn&#x27;t feel any difference in my skin after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two strikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband could also smell it all day. So it was pretty bad.</li>
    <li> Nivea Sensitive Shaving balm (non-cooling) has always been an example of good bang for the buck in shaving balms. At around $5 a bottle online, the Nivea standard Sensitive balm works about as well at calming the skin as much more expensive balms (e.g. ProRaso, three times the price and Jack Black, 4 times the price). It also works much better than costly all organic formulas, such as Pacific Shaving Company&#x27;s Caffeinated after shave (close to 80% more) and Body Shop&#x27;s Razor Relief (close to 3 times the price.) Nivea standard Sensitive formula had only two drawbacks: it used witch hazel, an astringent, that some don&#x27;t care for because it stings a little bit for a short while, and it also was not much of a moisturizer. Note that if you have dry skin, no post shave balm can really replace use of a second moisturizer, but even so, the standard Nivea Sensitive worked very poorly in terms of keeping your face moist after use for the intermediate term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Sensitive Cooling formula costs a little more, but fixes the small issues that existed in the original. Specifically, no witch hazel, and it also moisturizes significantly better, but note if you are a dry skinned dude, you will need to apply moisturizer after the balm unless you want your complexion to to look like Clint Eastwood&#x27;s in an hour or two after shaving. Sensitive Cooling also has a neat trick, mainly it creates a cooling sensation on the face which lasts for a half hour or so after application. More interestingly, it creates this cooling without menthol. Menthol cools, but also hurts the skin at the same time, so if you have really delicate skin, the menthol may irritate even as it cools. The Nivea Sensitive Cooling at least tn theory gives you all the cool and none of the irritation. (I don&#x27;t know what ingredient in the Cooling balm does the cooling work, so I am not 100% sure that whatever is cooling is not also an irritant to some degree, but on my face at least all is well!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended as a cheap effective and pleasant way to calm and cool your sensitive skinned face after a shave. I am one of those masochistic double edged blade guys who make three passes over their face every morning to get a clean shave, so if this works for me, it will be more than enough for all you single pass fusion dudes. Use this with some tallow based shaving soap (Tabac is great here on Amazon, or try Barrister and Mann for a non-Amazon artisanal product) and then put on some Aveeno for a moisturizer, and you will have a smooth, comfortable, and cheap shave!hly recommended as a cheap effective and pleasant way to calm and cool your sensitive skinned face after a shave.

    <li> This is the aftershave brand I keep coming back to. I&#x27;ve tried splashes, but I find the musky scents to be obnoxious. This stuff actually does what an aftershave is supposed to do. It sooths, cools and hydrates skin after shaving and leaves behind a nice light fresh scent. It&#x27;s nice because I&#x27;m a working professional and not everyone likes the odor of &amp;#34;wild musk&amp;#34; in a crowded meeting room at 8:30 am.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin that regularly gets irritated after shaving, particularly if the razor isn&#x27;t brand new. I we excited to try Nivea balm for its cooling and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t feel the cool or the soothe. It is not greasy just as advertised. I find the scent pleasant but too strong, and the scent lasts too long. It feels like how I feel when I put any lotion on my face. Nothing special. Not bad, just not good. Just feels like a moisturizing lotion.</li>
    <li> This Nivea Men shaving balm has a light, pleasant smell. It soothes razor burned skin and moisturizes it to avoid dryness caused by winter heating. It does the job. I probably would have given it five stars except for one issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a thin liquid compared to other balms that I have used. It pours out. I get too much every time and waste quite a bit. For that reason, I prefer Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm. It is similar to Nivea but thicker, and it squirts out. The Dove product is much easier to control how much you are getting. This also makes the Dove balm easier to apply consistently. The Nivea balm leaves a slimy feel sometimes because you end up with too much on your hand. Both products dry on your skin pretty quickly, so the Nivea sliminess doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove post-shave balm and I&#x27;ve been very happy with its performance, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what I&#x27;d think of this alternative from Nivea.  But like most Nivea products I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this balm compared to others is the bottle itself, which is made of heavy glass instead of the plastic used by most of its competitors.  I would have preferred a squeeze-type bottle to one with an open end, but the balm at least doesn&#x27;t come out messily or too easily.  Upon application it feels slightly cold, but in a good way, before turning towards a more comfortable warmth.  I feel like the softness and ease on skin that the Nivea provides is comparable to what I get from Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only aspect of the Nivea product that I don&#x27;t like is the smell, which is relatively pleasant but a little too cologne-like for my tastes.  I&#x27;m hesitant to let that color my review too much, however, since that same smell may appeal to many others.  Overall, I&#x27;d say that this is a nice product and one that I&#x27;d recommend to other guys.</li>
    <li> I never really put anything after I shave, and I do have a lot of facial hair.  I had to put this at a about half my face, that&#x27;s the area that I shave.  It was more soothing than I expected,  I did not personally experience the &#x27;cooling&#x27; sensation but I did feel a positive difference when you put it on.  It was not greasy which I loved and easily absorbed by your skin.  One caveat though, the scent is a bit too strong, and putting this on your face, so close to your nose is quite overwhelming.  It will be great if the manufacturers can tone down the scent a bit or better yet, offer an unscented version.  Overall, a great post shave balm that gives your skin a smoother  and calming feeling</li>
    <li> Nivea makes several after shave balms with this being similar to the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost all are a nice, smooth non-creasy lotion that dries rather quickly.  This one has an somewhat cooling feature added although I wouldn&#x27;t consider it excessive.  The product provides just a hint of fragrance and isn&#x27;t quite as strong as their base product.  Actually I like their base after shave balm a bit better due to the fragrance.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with any of these lotions if you are looking for a nice, non-heavy proudct to put on after shaving or showering.</li>
    <li> Used it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> It is an ok product. Does not help my irritation and flaking scalp from shaving. It is OVERPRICED here as I bought it in Target for $4.87.</li>
    <li> Love it. Been using this for years.</li>
    <li> I kind of liked it, honestly.  It seemed to be overkill as I use the liquid after shave product NIVEA offers as well.  I didn&#x27;t feel I needed to use both products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I have completely now dropped NIVEA from my cabinet, and for shaving have now gone with Harry&#x27;s.  Which I like immensely better.</li>
    <li> arrived quick and good product</li>
    <li> Been using it for over 20 years.</li>
    <li> using it daily. very soothing.</li>
    <li> very effective after shave for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff!! Smells great and does a nice job of cooling skin down after a shave. Does not leave any greasy residue. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This cream worked as advertised. It cooled my skin after I shaved and it smelled very good, a smell that lasted. My face felt smooth for hours. The cream came out easily from the jar.</li>
    <li> This post-shave balm surprised me by its watery composition.  Initially I thought it had separated in the bottle and required shaking, but that didn&#x27;t turn out to be the case.  (Perhaps I&#x27;ve just grown accustomed to creamier moisturizers.) Once I got past the texture, I found that it applied and absorbed easily and had a noticeable cooling effect, as advertised, along with a pleasing (albeit pronounced) scent.  Not sure there&#x27;s a place for an aftershave in my morning routine, however, as modern razors don&#x27;t cause me the degree of skin irritation that the older blades did.  So I&#x27;m more inclined to reach right for a daily moisturizer with a sun block component, skipping a shaving-specific balm.</li>
    <li> I gave this bottle of post shaving balm to my husband and then asked him questions about it to do this review. He does have sensitive skin and often gets light rashes after shaving. He said the Nivea balm calmed down the burning instantly. He said he liked it because the scent does not interfere with his regular cologne or after shave scents. He said he liked the moisturizing factor and that his skin felt smoother and looked healthier after using. We have dry winters and often I can see dry skin on his face, and I noticed the healthier glow to his skin right away. He also said it does not have a greasy feel as some shaving balms do. Overall, I believe he will buy this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product And A MUST If Shaving With A Straight Razor. The NO alcohol is key if you get the close shave that any good Or even MORE so bad straight razor gives you. Being a contrarian, I n ever even began using a straight razor until ordered to take Warfarin to thin my blood. Not sure why, seems like I am always looking to find ways to rebel? But ONE time using any after shave after my first encounter with my 2 new straight razors 5 years ago and I was singing falsetto for a couple days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have used virtually every incarnation, flavor &amp; smell of this but this must be new since I never saw it before. Now at age 66 I could care less if I have sensitive skin or not, I just LOVE the way it feels after a very close shave. True to form, this is just like all the ones by this brand I tried before. And here by the back gate to Camp Pendleton, the air is arid enough so it is nice not to dry out my skin any worse. For MY senses anyway, I found this to have almost NO scent at all. Seems like it is only ME who doesn&#x27;t smell it!  My wife however says it does and it smells \\&quot;clean\\&quot;. Maybe I smell \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; without it or something? I only know because I remarked to her that since this has no smell I was lucky to be able to still add my favorite cologne and not worry about messing up it&#x27;s smell with this added to it. That is when she advised me this does indeed have a smell but at least it was clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So as I mentioned, it is great with NO alcohol like all the others I have bought, neutral smell at least to ME alone I guess, is priced right and I can trust any &amp; all new varieties to be a pleasure to use. I have trusted them for over 5 years now and actually never even try anything else, even if on sale. It simply works.</li>
    <li> This is a good balm for shaving. The cool relief on my face is a great sensation. I like that it does not burn afterwards. I do have sensitive skin. So this works perfectly for my face. The scent is nice and not overpowering. Will not clash with my cologne.</li>
    <li> I like this product for the most part. I&#x27;m not a big fan of any kind of skin cream in general, because I just don&#x27;t like the gooey feeling you get on your hands when applying them. But I wanted to try this because my facial skin is sensitive and I thought it might be nice to have a soothing balm to apply on it after shaving. This balm does leave you with a refreshed feeling on your skin, and it does have a pleasant smell. My only complaint about it is that it has a very gooey texture, which is unpleasant to put on my hands.</li>
    <li> Nivea Men&#x27;s Post Shave Balm is a nice, soothing balm treatment for your sensitive, or insensitive, face after shaving.  It does have a scent that is initially very noticeable but seems to dissipate rather quickly after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this I opened it and tried it myself, just to see what it was like.  It felt soothing and slightly cooling on my skin, not as you would think of a menthol lotion cool, but a soothing, moisturizing cool sensation.  I noticed the scent and it seemed pretty powerful, surprisingly so for a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; balm, but it wasn&#x27;t repulsively so.  I asked my husband to use it and tell me what he thought of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning he came up to me before leaving for work and pressed his face to mine.  I gave him a little kiss and hug and he lingered.  I wasn&#x27;t certain about his motives as he was leaving for work but he finally told me he&#x27;d used the balm this morning and also yesterday.  I wouldn&#x27;t have known it by the scent so I intentionally tried to smell it.  There was only a faint scent remaining on his skin, which is a good thing.  He normally doesn&#x27;t wear cologne to work and didn&#x27;t want to smell like a &amp;#34;girlie man&amp;#34;, to use his phrase.  His skin felt smooth and soft to me but he said he didn&#x27;t notice a lot of difference.  He shaves with a blade razor and doesn&#x27;t usually use lotion on his face, but doesn&#x27;t have dry skin issues either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this all considered, I don&#x27;t see this being a big hit at our house.  It&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s not really great either and seems kind of expensive.  I will update if he has more to add after continued use.</li>
    <li> This shaving balm is not greasy, has a clean pleasant scent good for males or females. It goes on smooth, feels cool and prevents razor burn and ingrown hairs. It worked well on my sensitive and ingrown hair skin.</li>
    <li> This product greatly reduced the pain associated with razor bumps after facial shaving (my husband). Just on a whim, I used it on my legs after shaving because for some reason, I experience a light burning sensation followed by a light rash every time I shave my legs. I&#x27;m happy to report that this product prevented the burn and I didn&#x27;t spend the rest of the night scratching the top layer of skin on my legs off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Feels great after a wet shave.  More scent than I expected but it fades quickly.</li>
    <li> This is in a glass bottle with a screw cap, but the contents come out readily.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  My husband has psoriasis and this was a pleasant change from the alcohol-based after shaves.  He didn&#x27;t notice any cooling effect, but it was soothing.  I don&#x27;t really care for the fragrance, which I can&#x27;t really identify, but I would prefer only to smell his cologne.  It&#x27;s not that it was unpleasant, and it didn&#x27;t last long, but I would rather have a scentless variety.</li>
    <li> I like this after shave balm mainly because there&#x27;s no heavy fragrance or overly greasy feel to it. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it&#x27;s still as effective now as it was when I first tried it out. It&#x27;s a genuinely great product that hydrates your face well after you&#x27;ve shaved and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a pick up artist skulking around an Italian disco somewhere.</li>
    <li> I recently started shaving my face completely again (had a beard, but got tired of it).  I guess not shaving for a while caused my face to hate being shaved (it has gotten better over the last week).  This stuff was amazing!  After a shave I just put a very small amount (it is actually hard to get a small enough out of this bottle), a little of this stuff goes a long way!  Rubbed it between my hands and then onto my face and neck.  All the burning of the shaving stopped and it had a cool feeling (wind actually made it feel cold).  It was surprisingly soothing and also helped the red go away fro shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great and a little goes a long way so it should last me a while.  I like the glass bottle it is very elegant and after using this for a week my face is smoother and does not stay irritated after shaving.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t like the aftershaves I have tried in the past.  This is more like a thin lotion whereas the stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past more closely resembles... mouthwash (though a different scent).  The other stuff has the consistency of water and stings any damaged skin (that would be the alcohol).  I like the scent that this has, though (just like cologne) you can easily overdo it by applying too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a very small amount goes a long way to help your skin feel more hydrated.  I live in a desert and especially in the winter, my skin gets very dry.  Using a lotion like this is really helpful.  I also noticed a reduction in the little red blotches that often appear after a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied with this product.  As I noted, I like the scent and as long as you don&#x27;t use too much of it, I think the level is appropriate--especially given the fact that for many people, 1/2 the point of after-shave is for the scent.  If you want unscented, perhaps you may consider a regular lotion.</li>
    <li> Cooling lotion for a sensitive face. I like the slightly scented smell. It&#x27;s light and manly! Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This balm feels liked a combination of Nivea oil (which was, unfortunately, taken off the market a few years ago) and Nivea cream.  I love the way my husband&#x27;s face feels and smells when he uses this (but if truth be told, I love it when he doesn&#x27;t use it), but at least it in no way detracts from him.  My only disappointment was that this product was advertised as coming three to a pack and I was only shipped one item. :(</li>
    <li> This product is a combination of Davidoff Cool Water scent after shave with comfort of Nivea lotion.  It is not oily like some of the lotion and immediately dry on your skin once applied to your face.  The scent is really strong in the beginning but dissipate off after a short period of time.  I like this more than Cool Water because it doesn&#x27;t burn and actually very comforting like what a lotion does.  I am surprised Nivea packaged this product in a glass bottle and not in plastic.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. He has very sensitive skin and has had trouble finding a product that cools his skin after shaving and helps with the inevitable red bumps that appear immediately after. This works and makes his skin really smooth. Light scent is nice and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This product comes in a nice solid glass bottles with a lid that locks into place. That is a rarity these days.&lt;br /&gt;The balm is nice and cool on the skin. I do not find it oily and find no residue left behind. My face feels a little smoother and softer after a shave and applying this balm.&lt;br /&gt;I notice a fragrance but it is not very strong and disappears quickly.</li>
    <li> Item arrived promptly as described</li>
    <li> Great price on a quality product. Does a nice job on my skin after shaving.</li>
    <li> Just love it....better than other of the same brand.</li>
    <li> I can definitely say my skin truly appreciates this post shave balm. My skin seems to just suck it up like a sponge, even after I thought I put to much on my face. It works good for my scalp too, because I shave my scalp bald. I&#x27;ve been needing a balm like this for a long time and now I know which brand to use now because of this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the best after shave balm I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I apply this product in a smooth even layer on my freshly shaven skin.  It has a cooling refreshing feel as it is applied.  This product has several other great features. Having NO alcohol, as alcohol immediately harms the skin and starts a chain reaction of damage that continues long after it has evaporated. Studies have shown regular exposure to alcohol-based products, becomes a damaging ordeal, skin is no longer able to keep water and cleansing agents from penetrating into it, thus further eroding the skin&#x27;s barrier. It basically kills skin cells in turn ruining your complexion. It has Chamomile extract which is beneficial for caring for sensitive skin. The Chamomile plant is a natural antiseptic, antibacterial, anti fungal and offers anti-allergenic properties it is widely used in products made to treat rashes and other skin irritants.  It makes my face feel soft, smooth and hydrated.  No red razor burn here.</li>
