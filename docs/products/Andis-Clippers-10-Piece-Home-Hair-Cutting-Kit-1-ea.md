      <li>Now that I don&#x27;t have much hair, it is no use to give my money</li>
      <li>works very well.</li>
      <li>(maybe not so much the on/off switch</li>
      <li>Runs extremely quiet and cool, with a close shave doesn&#x27;t irritate the scalp.</li>
      <li>4 stars because they should have come with a few more sizes and a case to store them in.</li>
      <li>work normally</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for years now and this clipper works fine and the chrome color is nice too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Prior to this purchase, I bought the Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer, which apparently isn&#x27;t meant for touching the skin because it stung and left red marks.</li>
      <li>It was literally loud enough for my neighbors to hear -- and I live in the suburbs.</li>
      <li>If you only cut a few peoples hair at a certain length than these are fine due to only having 5 different sizes.</li>

    <li> got as a replacement for our andis t-liner which worked amazing on my husband.  he cuts his hair bald.  however the t-liner conked out on us after a few years and it was kind of expensive so I bought this.  does not shave his head close at all, it was like I used nothing.  He likes it for trimming his mustache and beard, but that&#x27;s all.  Not good for what I needed.  Have to invest in the more expensive t-liner.  I figured it was an andis so it would be good.</li>
    <li> This worked great the first couple times, but after that it started roaring like a jackhammer. It was literally loud enough for my neighbors to hear -- and I live in the suburbs. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> As shown in the image, its not a 10 pc kit. The right top attachment next to the komb does not come in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;Rest the clipper works great.</li>
    <li> It does not cut a thing! I try to used it many times, no work. It&#x27;s a Really Bad product.</li>
    <li> This kit works great in a pinch. However, I ended up investing in a more durable piece for a more day-to-day use. It&#x27;s great for taking on trips because it&#x27;s cheap and it doesn&#x27;t matter if it gets lost or damaged, but not for primary use.</li>
    <li> Looks used or refurbished. Heavy.</li>
    <li> i like it from of first time until it has some problem it doesn&#x27;t work very good the switch has problem i tried more time to turn on</li>
    <li> This thing broke during the third time I was using it. I was very disappointed. The material seems to be cheap and poorly manufactured. I bought the Wahl 79900 after this and it&#x27;s so much better. It costs $10 more but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m working in Afghanistan and this item came to me fairly quickly. It feels sturdy&lt;br /&gt;and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> After ordering I decided to review the user reviews on the product, and based on the share volume of the complaints, I didn&#x27;t bother opening the packaging and instantly returned it.  I&#x27;m just not a chance taker especially since the main complaint was a power problem with the unit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good value clipper for the cheap price of under $15. Make sure you read the manual before using for the first time in order to set the power screw correctly. It does get pretty warm after using for a while. It also doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would like when using the blade only. Still its a good clipper for the money.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product! Best clippers I&#x27;ve bought for the price!</li>
    <li> did a fair job  could have done a better job</li>
    <li> My son was very pleased with these as I bought them for him. They were just what he  wanted. Great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for years now and this clipper works fine and the chrome color is nice too. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> They stopped working after three days. They were poorly made. They were knock offs. I am a stylist and I need quality tools</li>

    <li> Very good quality product it does the job well and I would recommend to a friend, Love IT Love IT</li>
    <li> very good machine but should bring more parts to cut .. has no problems is very good and it was sealed and in good condition</li>
    <li> this is nice and cuts super close</li>
    <li> Does a great job trimming my neck, which is what I bought it for.  Unit is sturdy and heavy.  Have used only once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this purchase, I bought the Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer, which apparently isn&#x27;t meant for touching the skin because it stung and left red marks.</li>
    <li> this is a great clipper, makes trimming my beard and cutting my hair very easy. Now that I don&#x27;t have much hair, it is no use to give my money away.&lt;br /&gt;Tom W</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I got exactly what I paid for.  It arrived promptly and in very good condition.</li>
    <li> Cut real smooth but have a problem that it&#x27;s starting to make a lot of noise at times that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> I like the product. works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this to figure out how to cut hair so I could just do my boyfriends and save money for him. I got it within a week (very happy) and when I opened it I was very happy with how hefty it felt.</li>
    <li> Excelent... I didnt have problem... work normally and it is good by the color its so elegant.. i recommend it</li>
    <li> I am glad i got this all in one piece and it looks like its going to work well. Thank you again!</li>
    <li> I could not get the item to work properly.  I took it to my barber.  She told me that &amp;#34;clippers&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;were not rotating properly .  The barber uses this same brand.  I was to late to exercise my&lt;br /&gt;30 day warranty</li>
    <li> Great clipper, price, delivery, easily does the job of those with higher price tags. Weight is heavy but not overly so and seems to be made of quality parts (maybe not so much the on/off switch but you can&#x27;t have it all with rock bottom pricing). Runs extremely quiet and cool, with a close shave doesn&#x27;t irritate the scalp. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with purchase. Have also had good luck with Andis clippers over many years.</li>
    <li> Good set of clippers. If you only cut a few peoples hair at a certain length than these are fine due to only having 5 different sizes. great buy for the money. 4 stars because they should have come with a few more sizes and a case to store them in.</li>
