      <li>very good as I expected...</li>
      <li>The opening has to be a huge turnoff for 80% of the people that buy it.  </li>
      <li>Huge escense.</li>
      <li>it came in 2 days for free shipping..</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smile like L eau Bleue  that I been using  it for many years</li>
      <li>Very masculine and sexy smell!  </li>
      <li>This cologne has been my favorite since it was first launched.</li>
      <li>A 2.5 oz bottle of L&#x27;eau Bleue was given to me as a gift by accident in 2006 by my mother who thought it was the original L&#x27;eau D&#x27;Issey which I wore at the time.</li>
      <li>As a classic issey miyake user I must say its pretty good.</li>
      <li>star for the delivery was quite quick</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite men fragrance&#x27;s,the smell is great and long lasting.</li>
      <li>It took a bout a year to really grow on me even though it was a huge compliment getter with the ladies.</li>
      <li>any more so it&#x27;d be kind of hard to get a sample or smell it in person, so</li>
      <li>Very very dissapointed</li>
      <li>I have worn this and her first reaction was it smells like medicine..  </li>
      <li>especially the ladies love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>This review may show up twice as the first time I tried to submit it my iphone locked up..</li>
      <li>I will wear it some more and report back.</li>
      <li>This perfume has been one of my favorite since long time ago.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorites fragrances: the mix of woods, citrus and herbs makes it perfect to use in hot or cold weathers.</li>
      <li>Great longevity, slightly above average sillage.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a slightly heavy and really amazing smell, I would suggest Versace Dreamer.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave much to be desired.</li>
      <li>This is not the real deal.</li>
      <li>and they didn&#x27;t like it much either.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very &amp;#34;serious&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
      <li>It smells nothing like the original L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey, but refreshingly different.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this frag to any men 25 years old and older, though a younger guy may be able to get away with it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The scent is intense and masculine.</li>
      <li>The package was what I expected, and came right on time!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they would make the opening so harsh if it&#x27;s going to put off so many people initially.  </li>
      <li>But this Issey Miyake is even heavier and less sweet.  </li>
      <li>I live it back in 2005 but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 39 year old male.  </li>

<li> So far I&#x27;ve gone through half of a 4.2 oz bottle in under a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;The closest cologne to it in my memory would probably be that old school Polo in the green bottle that my dad used to wear.  </li>
<li> It settles down into an herbal smell, something reminiscent of those grassy, eucalyptus smelling oils that masseuses use on you.  </li>
<li> As others have noted, it&#x27;s a very heavy smell when it opens.  </li>
<li> I hated it at first!</li>
<li> and you will be addicted to it.</li>
<li> Not that it is bad, but it is just very heavy.  </li>
<li> I think this one I bought is a fake one.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that it is so difficult to find in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;It is a fragrance that can be used at all times and all occasions.</li>
<li> This is a nostalgic scent for me.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with miyake</li>
<li> I am disappointed by the product,  its not what it used ti be.</li>
<li> Absolutely horrible.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t like this perfume. I think this one I bought is a fake one. When you spray it on you, it&#x27;s like water.</li>
    <li> This perfume has been one of my favorite since long time ago. Its fragance is lovely and unique. I&#x27;m very glad having the change of buying this perfume.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed by the product,  its not what it used ti be. I live it back in 2005 but not anymore tge smell is good for just an hour then its all gone.. its not woth it. I just feel I lost my money I don&#x27;t want even to wear it now :/&lt;br /&gt;One star for the delivery was quite quick</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite men fragrance&#x27;s,the smell is great and long lasting.I always recommend this fragrance to my friends.</li>
    <li> Hints of patchouli, can be overpowering, but still an excellent fragrance.  I get complimented on the scent.  I think I like the original best though.</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery, surely i wiil buy it again</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites fragrances: the mix of woods, citrus and herbs makes it perfect to use in hot or cold weathers. I am very happy to have found this cologne on Amazon! The item arrived before I was expecting it. The quality, price, seller and time all were excellent. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> great smell, lasts for a good time</li>
    <li> great buy and find too</li>
    <li> Classic, great authentic scent so I recommend based on the validity.</li>
    <li> I actually smelled this on a colleague, I asked his wife what it was.  Very masculine and sexy smell!  My guy loves it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smile like L eau Bleue  that I been using  it for many years</li>
    <li> This is a nostalgic scent for me. A 2.5 oz bottle of L&#x27;eau Bleue was given to me as a gift by accident in 2006 by my mother who thought it was the original L&#x27;eau D&#x27;Issey which I wore at the time. I hated it at first! It took a bout a year to really grow on me even though it was a huge compliment getter with the ladies. When I finally ran out in 2010 I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! I was under the impression that it had been discontinued. I finally came across it here on Amazon about a year ago. So far I&#x27;ve gone through half of a 4.2 oz bottle in under a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;eau Bleue smells like a blast of rosemary and citrus. It&#x27;s a greenish scent in my opinion, though others may not agree. It smells nothing like the original L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey, but refreshingly different. It&#x27;s still a major compliment getter and took me back to my early 20s smelling it again after a few years. I think a comparable scent would be Cartier Declaration Essence, though again others may not agree with me here, but I think the smells are in the same family. I&#x27;d highly recommend this frag to any men 25 years old and older, though a younger guy may be able to get away with it. L&#x27;eau Bleue isn&#x27;t carried in dept stores any more so it&#x27;d be kind of hard to get a sample or smell it in person, so if you&#x27;ve never smelled it I&#x27;d say go for it! It doesn&#x27;t leave much to be desired. Great longevity, slightly above average sillage. 4/5 stars!</li>
    <li> This is what I imagine a middle eastern warlord in the desert would have smelled like in the 1700&#x27;s.  I bought this accidentally as i thought I had tried it at a department store already.  As others have noted, it&#x27;s a very heavy smell when it opens.  It settles down into an herbal smell, something reminiscent of those grassy, eucalyptus smelling oils that masseuses use on you.  I tried to like the smell for a couple of days but the bottom line is that it is just too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest cologne to it in my memory would probably be that old school Polo in the green bottle that my dad used to wear.  But this Issey Miyake is even heavier and less sweet.  I had a couple women at the office smell it on me too and they didn&#x27;t like it much either.  It&#x27;s a very &amp;#34;serious&amp;#34; smell.  It&#x27;s not uplifting.  The opening has to be a huge turnoff for 80% of the people that buy it.  Not that it is bad, but it is just very heavy.  I don&#x27;t understand why they would make the opening so harsh if it&#x27;s going to put off so many people initially.  If you are looking for a slightly heavy and really amazing smell, I would suggest Versace Dreamer.  It has a tobacco, spicy smell but it is very good and gets a lot of compliments.  I&#x27;m a 39 year old male.  Hope this helps.  This review may show up twice as the first time I tried to submit it my iphone locked up.. The shipping was great though- it came in 2 days for free shipping..</li>
    <li> Ok guys if you read any of my reviews its all about the Lady and if she smells it at all, hates it or likes it. I have worn this and her first reaction was it smells like medicine..
