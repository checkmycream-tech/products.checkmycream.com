      <li>I was expecting more for what I paid for it</li>
      <li>and I honestly like the original one better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this Chi Turbo for almost 3 years now, and it is still the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
      <li>It is pretty good.</li>
      <li>First, let me say the product itself was of good quality.  </li>
      <li>It heats up very quickly, it doesn&#x27;t pull hair and it gets the job done.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been the loyal owner of a Chi for 8 years now, with my first Chi being a Chi Turbo that I loved.  </li>
      <li>It is so easy to use and made my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>

      <li>If you are looking for a good flat iron but are worried about shelling out the money, buy this one.  </li>
      <li>I loved this flat iron!  </li>
      <li>It heated up super fast and was easy to operate.  </li>
      <li>I love my new CHI.</li>
      <li>BY a long shot, this is the best flat iron ever.  </li>
      <li>Worth the higher price!</li>
      <li>It is attractive in appearance and the red velvety fabric gives it a soft touch.</li>
      <li>(a) I can more easily change the temperature, (b) the blue colored light makes it much easier to see if I&#x27;ve accidentally left the Chi on, and</li>
      <li>The hair straightener heats up quickly and the digital screen makes it easy to know when it is hot.  </li>
      <li>However, this new Chi Turbo Digital is even better!  </li>
      <li>As for my hair,  this straightener is fantastic and straightens really well and really quickly and does less damage to my hair than does most straighteners.  </li>
      <li>Bought this for my daughter &amp; thought it was pretty pricey, but then I don&#x27;t use one of these.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The last thing I needed was more damage from heat.  </li>
      <li>I love chi, but not the digital one.</li>
      <li>I first bought this item at Bed Bath and Beyond.  </li>
      <li>I can adjust the temp much better with digital temp control.</li>
      <li>but I love the digital aspect in that</li>
      <li>but they were too hot for my hair.</li>
      <li>I have had better luck with off brand $30 flat irons.  </li>
      <li>But let&#x27;s be clear, she used it almost every other day for about 5 years, which is pretty good use out of a product if you ask me.  </li>
      <li>Ordering was simple and easy but I was dissappointed in having to pay shipping....</li>
      <li>You can also set it to turn off automatically after a certain amount of time</li>
      <li>This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve purchased this straightener because I enjoy it so much.</li>
      <li>It left my hair smooth and silky/shiny looking.  </li>
      <li>My hair is never frizzy and it stays straight throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Then I thought, Oh I should check and see how much they are selling for on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t as excited for the flat iron as I thought I would be.</li>
      <li>She loves this Chi and likes the smaller 1 inch iron versus the larger one she had before because it gives her more control</li>
      <li>Even saying that, I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It reached a really high heat too.  </li>
      <li>I agree with other reviewers that it would be nice if they could create a Chi that maintains a constant temperature</li>
      <li>Easy to use, money well spent!</li>
      <li>It was definately worth the extra over the lower priced models.</li>
      <li>I was at a loss when my Chi of 7 years stopped working but definitely felt it had been worth every cent</li>
      <li>As someone who uses my chi all the time I had to immediately search for a new one.</li>
      <li>It straighten and the heat is consistent but it doesn&#x27;t add any shine and my hair doesn&#x27;t remain straight for long.</li>
      <li>I have tried many $$$$ brands as well as other Chi irons, but the Chi Turbo makes you hair the shinest and last the longest.  </li>
      <li>exactly how long you want it on</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although she said she loves it, I always see her using her old one</li>
      <li>Also love the auto off feature, no more worrying when I leave the house if I left my straightner on.</li>
      <li>The one thing that my other Chi did not have was the auto shut off feature so this Chi was exactly the replacement I was looking for.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it daily and have no complaints about this product.      </li>
      <li>I am very dissappointed considering the amount of money I spent.</li>
      <li>I have to say that I was a little nervous about spending this much money on a hair tool.</li>

<li> Like another reviewer, I thought all Chi products were quality made but apparently not.</li>
<li> I purchased this flat iron this week and received it yesterday.  </li>
<li> I had always wanted a flat iron</li>
<li> and I hope this one lasts me just as long as the last or longer!</li>
<li> I was told to get a flat iron with adjustable temperature</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to &amp;#34;invest&amp;#34; in a quality flat iron!</li>
<li> considering how long it had lasted.</li>
<li> I have only used this flat iron half a dozen times and every time I straighten a section of hair</li>
<li> However, I think it is a little over priced since I bought my old one for almost half this price.</li>
<li> I only had it for a few weeks before it started to malfunction.</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> I just wish it would get a little hotter.</li>
<li> I have owned a few CHIs</li>
<li> Unfortunately this product was a huge disappointment.</li>
<li> I have extremely thick hair, and the chi straightens it within just a matter of a few minutes.  </li>
<li> I had been searching for this item in stores and the retail price was at least $160.00.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was at a loss when my Chi of 7 years stopped working but definitely felt it had been worth every cent considering how long it had lasted. As someone who uses my chi all the time I had to immediately search for a new one. The one thing that my other Chi did not have was the auto shut off feature so this Chi was exactly the replacement I was looking for. You can set the timer to exactly how long you want it on and then if you forget to turn it off you can rest assured that it&#x27;s already been done for you. I agree with other reviewers that it would be nice if they could create a Chi that maintains a constant temperature but since I have been using a Chi for years I&#x27;ve already grown used to having to wait a minute or two for it to return to the set temp at times. I can&#x27;t imagine life without my Chi and I hope this one lasts me just as long as the last or longer!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife.  She is very happy with the straightener so far.  Service was excellent from Amazon as per usual.</li>
    <li> It is pretty good. My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t remain a consistant heat.  Other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I love my CHI Turbo. I can adjust the temp much better with digital temp control. However, I think it is a little over priced since I bought my old one for almost half this price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter &amp; thought it was pretty pricey, but then I don&#x27;t use one of these.&lt;br /&gt;Although she said she loves it, I always see her using her old one still.&lt;br /&gt;So tells me, maybe she didn&#x27;t like it as well, she just doesn&#x27;t want to tell me.</li>
    <li> I was told to get a flat iron with adjustable temperature and this one works great.  It was definately worth the extra over the lower priced models.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for this item in stores and the retail price was at least $160.00.  This was about have the price I would have paid in the store and the product works great!!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this product.  I thought all Chi products were quality made but apparently not.  I have only used this flat iron half a dozen times and every time I straighten a section of hair the iron looses about 40 degrees of heat.  So I have to wait until it heats up again to do the next section.  Obvious this is very annoying especially when I am in a hurry.  I have had better luck with off brand $30 flat irons.  I am very dissappointed considering the amount of money I spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Chi Turbo for almost 3 years now, and it is still the best flat iron I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t always stay as hot as it&#x27;s supposed to (but probably for the better...), but it does the job every time. The adjustable heat is great, and it&#x27;s extremely easy to use.</li>
    <li> BY a long shot, this is the best flat iron ever.  I have tried many $$$$ brands as well as other Chi irons, but the Chi Turbo makes you hair the shinest and last the longest.  This is the best iron EVER!</li>
    <li> I first bought this item at Bed Bath and Beyond.  Then I thought, Oh I should check and see how much they are selling for on Amazon.  Returned item that day to Bed Bath and Beyond and order it from Amazon!  Gotta love competition. :)</li>
    <li> This is the best iron I have used.  Others can&#x27;t compare to this Chi. Worth the higher price! I would definitely reccommend this one!</li>
    <li> I love my new CHI. The adjustable heat is wonderful. My hair is damaged and being able to turn down the heat as needed is great. Also love the auto off feature, no more worrying when I leave the house if I left my straightner on.</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer, I thought all Chi products were quality made but apparently not. Every time I straighten a section of hair the iron looses about 40 degrees of heat. This makes straightening my hair quite an ordeal. I have to strategically straighten a section, then put brush my teeth. Then another section and put on my foundation. Then another section and my eye make-up. Straightening fairly short hair shouldn&#x27;t be such a process, especially not for this price tag! Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t as excited for the flat iron as I thought I would be. It straighten and the heat is consistent but it doesn&#x27;t add any shine and my hair doesn&#x27;t remain straight for long. I was expecting more for what I paid for it</li>
    <li> First, let me say the product itself was of good quality.  The reason I was so dissatisfied was the shipping was unacceptably late.      I was going out of town and paid a lot extra to have the product shipped to where I was.  Based on the shipping time line it should have arrived on Friday, allowing plenty of time for it to arrive, even if it arrived one day late.  The product didn&#x27;t arrive until after I left so I had to pay $40.00 extra to have it shipped to my home.  If shipping time lines are important to you I would not buy from this vendor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now had this straightener for about 3 years, and it still works great. This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve purchased this straightener because I enjoy it so much. The only complaint I have is that I wish there wasn&#x27;t the red felt on the outside of the iron parts, because it limits certain things I can do with it (I would like to use it to &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34; my hair). Even saying that, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been the loyal owner of a Chi for 8 years now, with my first Chi being a Chi Turbo that I loved.  However, this new Chi Turbo Digital is even better!  It works just as well as the original but I love the digital aspect in that (a) I can more easily change the temperature, (b) the blue colored light makes it much easier to see if I&#x27;ve accidentally left the Chi on, and (c) I can set the auto-off feature.  As for my hair,  this straightener is fantastic and straightens really well and really quickly and does less damage to my hair than does most straighteners.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> But let&#x27;s be clear, she used it almost every other day for about 5 years, which is pretty good use out of a product if you ask me.  She loves this Chi and likes the smaller 1 inch iron versus the larger one she had before because it gives her more control</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron this week and received it yesterday.  I have to say that I was a little nervous about spending this much money on a hair tool. Oh my goodness! It is AWESOME! It is so easy to use and made my hair smooth and shiny.  I color my hair and have experienced some damage as a result.  The last thing I needed was more damage from heat.  No worries about that with this iron. I look forward to using this flat iron on a daily basis.  If you are looking for a good flat iron but are worried about shelling out the money, buy this one.  It is well worth it!</li>
    <li> It is light-weight, it heats up quickly and I love that I can set the temperature. It is attractive in appearance and the red velvety fabric gives it a soft touch. So far I&#x27;ve used it daily and have no complaints about this product.      Ordering was simple and easy but I was dissappointed in having to pay shipping....after all I was ordering from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing! I used to have a Paul Mitchell (until my sister broke it) and this one works wonders! My hair is never frizzy and it stays straight throughout the day. I work in a restaurant so I can sweat sometimes, but my hair still stays fabulous! The 2 Chi products it comes with are such a great deal! Those bottles separately cost over 20 dollars each! I totally recommend this product! The only bad thing about it is that the warranty doesn&#x27;t apply since it was purchased over the internet!</li>
    <li> I could not be happier with this product.  The hair straightener heats up quickly and the digital screen makes it easy to know when it is hot.  I have extremely thick hair, and the chi straightens it within just a matter of a few minutes.  You can also set it to turn off automatically after a certain amount of time so I don&#x27;t leave home worrying if I forgot to turn it off.  Love my Chi!</li>
    <li> I like the original one the best.</li>
    <li> I have owned a few CHIs and I honestly like the original one better.  That said, I&#x27;m happy with this one.  It heats up very quickly, it doesn&#x27;t pull hair and it gets the job done.  I just wish it would get a little hotter.</li>
    <li> I loved this flat iron!  It heated up super fast and was easy to operate.  It reached a really high heat too.  It left my hair smooth and silky/shiny looking.  However, after about a year or so, it started taking longer to heat up, and it wouldn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s heat all the way through the process. I would have to straighten a section of hair, and then wait for it to heat itself back up again (about 60 degrees, which makes a difference in my hair).  It started taking longer and longer, so I just put it out to pasture.</li>
    <li> I purchased two Chi Irons in the last 3 years. They do not last. The heating element stops working.  They are expensive and I would advise anyone to think about this purchase very carefully..</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product was a huge disappointment. I love chi, but not the digital one. I only had it for a few weeks before it started to malfunction. It would lose heat, it would turn off randomly, etc. Mine could have been faulty because my friend had one and it worked great, but I won&#x27;t buy a digital Chi again</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to &amp;#34;invest&amp;#34; in a quality flat iron! Easy to use, money well spent!</li>
    <li> I had always wanted a flat iron but they were too hot for my hair. Since this one has digital controls it is really great for me</li>
