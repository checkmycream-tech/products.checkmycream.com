      <li>The perfect color for fall!</li>
      <li>beautiful color.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so beautiful and pearl-like.</li>
      <li>But it is still a great color.</li>
      <li>Great coverage.</li>
      <li>Looks great on.</li>
      <li>and I think would look great on all skin tones.</li>
      <li>The thickness is good, but the brush is not an even spreader.</li>
      <li>Good coverage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a gorgeous color, though.</li>
      <li>It is gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Love this color!</li>
      <li>I simply love this color!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite now.</li>
      <li>The color is more gray than anything else.  </li>
      <li>and I am glad I bought it, because I do like the color</li>
      <li>The formula is fab as well :)</li>
      <li>This color is so stunning.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;d work for most skin tones too.</li>
      <li>BUT I LOVE THE COLOR</li>
      <li>I love china glaze.</li>
      <li>The color is very unique</li>
      <li>The shimmer doesn&#x27;t show well unless you are in direct sunlight, but when you are it is beautiful.</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>This color looks brilliant on, I use a matt top coat sometimes and that totally changes the look as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great formula and easy application.  </li>
      <li>The delivery time was fast and the product is exceptional.  </li>
      <li>but this has such a light, beautiful, red shimmer to it that it&#x27;s just gorgeous.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite brands; has good coverage, low chip and the coloring is true to this image.</li>
      <li>would like to note that this is a pretty close dupe to a Chanel nail color (Paradoxal) that retails for almost $30 : )</li>
      <li>Jungle Queen is a much more reasonably priced alternative.</li>
      <li>This color has quickly become my go to shade.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still very pretty</li>
      <li>think this is going to be my new favorite fall nail polish color.</li>
      <li>It is kind of grey in color.</li>
      <li>But if you are wanting this EXACT color, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
      <li>I love it although I expected it to be more purple than it actually is.</li>
      <li>It looks more of a flat color (in the picture posted) than it really is in person.</li>
      <li>I applied Jungle Queen for the first time the other day and LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Delivery was fast and packaging was sufficient.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a purple brown color, very neat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a black with purple opal-y highlights through it.</li>
      <li>I love that even in low light, this polish still looks purple, whereas most darker hues appear dark grey or black in that</li>
      <li>The word requirement makes me complete this sentence, which I think is over rated.</li>
      <li>It is okay, but I expected it to be a dark plum looking color.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE COLOR I GOT... but its not what is pictured...instead its a grey with a little purple mixed in it.</li>
      <li>I do find it tends to chip after a couple of days, nothing major though.</li>
      <li>It is mainly purple with a hint of grey.</li>
      <li>add a good base and top coat and this will stay for at least 2 weeks</li>

<li> I usually don&#x27;t like purple</li>
<li> I give it a 3 because it&#x27;s def not the color I purchased which I&#x27;m disappointed about.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this color! It&#x27;s so beautiful and pearl-like. You see all it&#x27;s different tones in sunlight. I love china glaze. Google the color before purchasing.</li>
    <li> thought this was a plum color but it isnt</li>
    <li> I simply love this color! The shimmer doesn&#x27;t show well unless you are in direct sunlight, but when you are it is beautiful. I seen on a nail blog that this is a dupe to Chanel&#x27;s polish called Paradoxal I believe. Jungle Queen is a much more reasonably priced alternative. This color has quickly become my go to shade. I do find it tends to chip after a couple of days, nothing major though.</li>
    <li> I give it a 3 because it&#x27;s def not the color I purchased which I&#x27;m disappointed about.</li>
    <li> Not quite the color that is shown in the description. It is okay, but I expected it to be a dark plum looking color.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite brands; has good coverage, low chip and the coloring is true to this image. The perfect color for fall!</li>
    <li> This color is so stunning. I usually don&#x27;t like purple but this has such a light, beautiful, red shimmer to it that it&#x27;s just gorgeous. The formula is fab as well :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE COLOR I GOT... but its not what is pictured...instead its a grey with a little purple mixed in it. It DEFINETLY does not look like that color in the picture. BUT I LOVE THE COLOR</li>
    <li> Jungle Queen is mostly grey with purple undertones. It is slightly translucent purple. It looks more of a flat color (in the picture posted) than it really is in person. Great coverage. Only Two coats needed. Looks great on. I think it&#x27;d work for most skin tones too. I love it although I expected it to be more purple than it actually is. Anyone who likes dark colors will probably like this unless they dislike shades of grey polishes. This is definitely a purple-grey color though.</li>
    <li> It is kind of grey in color. I was hoping for plum like dark purple. But it is still a great color.</li>
    <li> This color looks brilliant on, I use a matt top coat sometimes and that totally changes the look as well.</li>
    <li> I applied Jungle Queen for the first time the other day and LOVE IT. It is the perfect fall/winter color.  It is mainly purple with a hint of grey. (Think a slightly lighter version of Essie&#x27;s Smokin Hot with a purple base). I love that even in low light, this polish still looks purple, whereas most darker hues appear dark grey or black in that lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great formula and easy application.  Fully opaque in two coats. Used Seche Vite base and top coat 3 days ago and so far no chips.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my next pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also would like to note that this is a pretty close dupe to a Chanel nail color (Paradoxal) that retails for almost $30 : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is going to be my new favorite fall nail polish color.</li>
    <li> The thickness is good, but the brush is not an even spreader. The word requirement makes me complete this sentence, which I think is over rated.</li>
    <li> The delivery time was fast and the product is exceptional.  The color is very unique and I think would look great on all skin tones.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the same color as in the picture. It&#x27;s more of a black with purple opal-y highlights through it. It&#x27;s still very pretty and I am glad I bought it, because I do like the color and I do use it. But if you are wanting this EXACT color, don&#x27;t buy it. You will be dissapointed. It&#x27;s still a gorgeous color, though.</li>
    <li> beautiful color.  perfect for the fall and Christmas holidays.  add a good base and top coat and this will stay for at least 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Believe it or not I ordered this polish because of its name! My email and license plates are jungle queen! So I had no idea what to expect. I was not disappointed! This is my favorite now. It is a deep maroon/purple, almost black but you do see the people in it. It is gorgeous. You will not be disappointed offering this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast and packaging was sufficient. I am very happy with product and delivery.</li>
    <li> This color is a bit different. It&#x27;s a purple brown color, very neat. Good coverage. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> The color is more gray than anything else.  It&#x27;s not nearly as maroon as it looks.</li>
