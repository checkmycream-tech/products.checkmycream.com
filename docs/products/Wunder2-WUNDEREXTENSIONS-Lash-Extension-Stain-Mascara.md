<li> Three looks like you&#x27;ve got to die for natural lashes.</li>
<li> I was under the impression it looked natural and stained your lashes darker with a bit of extensions all I got was two black eyes after 1st day on.  </li>
<li> so I have to be very careful in applying</li>
<li> I have purchased Wunder Extensions before but this seems to be an imitation.</li>
<li> This takes less than a minute.  </li>
<li> Each morning there is slight residue under eyes to be removed with moisturizer.</li>
<li> brush is long &amp; hard to manuever without smuding</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t wear mascara everyday, so perhaps that has some bearing.</li>
<li> A waste of money.</li>
<li> Lashes are stiff to the touch.</li>
<li> Lashes are not so stiff.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is -- can&#x27;t say that it was anything out of the ordinary.  </li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t stay on for three days as advertised...at least not for me.  </li>
<li> (at least when I googled it, that&#x27;s what I found), but also stays on when I swim.</li>
<li> Day One is dramatic eyes with one coat.</li>
<li> Just a waste of money :(</li>
<li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a stain that doesn&#x27;t still smear.</li>
<li> It cakes and spills on my face during the day and is worst than I have ever used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There are no words!  I did not like this product at all!</li>
    <li> Made my lashes feel sticky.</li>
    <li> For the price not to impressed. I am used to mascara and this is not mascara. It is a lash stain. Going on vacation soon and makeup needs to be light so I will give this a try for vacation. I think it will be fine for the not to made up vacation look. More to come</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a stain that doesn&#x27;t still smear. This one stays on for a day but then ends up smearing.</li>
    <li> Too clumpy but I&#x27;m also a non mascara wearer I have extremely long full lashes I use those serums that make your lashes full &amp; grow. I gave it 1star because I cant leave no stars. I was under the impression it looked natural and stained your lashes darker with a bit of extensions all I got was two black eyes after 1st day on.  Just a waste of money :(</li>
    <li> It took me some time to make sure I was doing it right, but it really ended up being easier than I thought it would be!</li>
    <li> It looks good when first applied but the  product does not perform better than any waterproof mascaras I have tried. It smears under my eyes through the day and after I shower. It also seems to make my eyes very sore.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Wunder Extensions before but this seems to be an imitation. It cakes and spills on my face during the day and is worst than I have ever used. Do not recommend. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> the best at giving me lashes for the long day or days ahead- needs a remover to clear off residue but it does stay on whatever!!&lt;br /&gt;worth it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is -- can&#x27;t say that it was anything out of the ordinary.  I don&#x27;t wear mascara everyday, so perhaps that has some bearing.</li>
    <li> This did not work well for me.</li>
    <li> This is nothing more than waterproof mascara.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works well, but I find it uncomfortable to leave mascara on for more than one day at a time.</li>
    <li> This really does Extend the Eyelashes and Enhances my Brown Eyes Greatly!  I&#x27;ve had the Extended Look for 5 days already.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Did not last at all. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Applies very easily, but if applied to both top and bottom lashes, keep your eyes wide open until dry...Otherwise they stick together when you blink. This takes less than a minute.  Day One is dramatic eyes with one coat. Lashes are stiff to the touch. Day Two Looks like you&#x27;re wearing mascara. Lashes are not so stiff. Day Three looks like you&#x27;ve got to die for natural lashes. Lashes are not stiff at all. Day Four, take off and start over.  Comes off with &#x27;waterproof&#x27; mascara remover.  Each morning there is slight residue under eyes to be removed with moisturizer. Taking a shower and washing my face didn&#x27;t affect the mascara at all. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara for daily use as it doesn&#x27;t rub off and leave smudge marks under my eyebrows or lower lashes like most mascaras do.  However, it does tend to clump so I have to be very careful in applying and it doesn&#x27;t stay on for three days as advertised...at least not for me.  There is still some on my lashes the second day, enough if I&#x27;m just staying home, but if I&#x27;m going out of the house, I have to re-apply. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll purchase another tube or not at this point.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I believe it&#x27;s not only animal cruelty free (at least when I googled it, that&#x27;s what I found), but also stays on when I swim. I don&#x27;t have racoon eyes when I get out of the pool.</li>
    <li> okay. brush is long &amp; hard to manuever without smuding</li>
    <li> With my blond eyelashes this product is awesome..now I have eyelashes that show!</li>
    <li> It is okay to wear by itself but difficult to remove.</li>
