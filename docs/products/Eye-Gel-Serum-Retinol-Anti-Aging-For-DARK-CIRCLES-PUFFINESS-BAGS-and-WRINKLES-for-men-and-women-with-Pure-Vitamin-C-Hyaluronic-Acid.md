    <li> Bought this for mu husband and he loves it. The result is amazing.</li>
    <li> great product. I love it</li>
    <li> This product is amazing,  I have used it consistently for a month now and the I can definitely see a difference.  The puffiness is gone and under my eyes looks smooth and the dryness is gone. This is better than much more expensive brands I have bought in the past and I would continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dark circles !  Love Love Love this stuff !!!</li>
    <li> This eye gel is a GOD send my eyes were becoming real dark and droopy I could feel them getting tighter after the first use. Great eye gel.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  It really does what it promises.  I applied it, stepped away from the mirror, looked back and got a real surprise!  My dark circles were gone and my whole eye area looked bright and alert.  I would highly recommend this product!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this product and love this brand. I have purchased many products from Swiss Botany and have never been disappointed.This product has done wonders for my dark circles. I have always had dark circles and since using this, there has been a major improvement. Absolrbs well into the skin and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. Doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling. I will continue to buy and use.</li>
    <li> In just 2 applications I could see a difference.  Having circles under my eyes has been a problem of mine for as long as I can remember. The puffiness is what makes the darkness and this product soothed the puffiness.</li>
    <li> First let me say I have used other eye gel products before trying this one. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. I have used it daily for over two weeks now &amp; wish I had discovered it years ago. I have had puffiness &amp; slight bags under my eyes since I was in my 30&#x27;s. I tried creams that tightened them up for a few hours but felt so tight &amp; uncomfortable before looking cracked in that area. Not what I wanted at all. You only need use a small amount under &amp; on the sides of the eyes. It feels so cooling &amp; the bags &amp; puffiness are gone. The crows feet are much less noticeable. Because I look younger I feel better about myself. I don&#x27;t mind getting older but I don&#x27;t like it to show more than necessary &amp; this eye gel helps.</li>
    <li> This product has been every bit as effective as I expected it to be.  My dark circles have become a bit lighter, and I am sure that with continued use they will be much better.  The puffiness is also greatly diminished.  I will definitely continue to use this gel, and heartily recommend it to anyone who has the same problems that I have had.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 3 weeks now. I can honestly say that it truly is a wonderful product. I have extremely dark circles and have noticed that my eyes do not appear as tired and the circles have lightened noticeably. The skin also appears to have tightened so my eyes don&#x27;t appear as puffy. I have used many products in the past but this is by far the best I have come across. I am definitely going to continue to use this!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product but it has surprised me.  I noticed how much it worked when I forgot to use it and then looked at my reflection in the mirror and saw the bags under my eyes!  Let&#x27;s just say I use it regularly now!  I really like the pump dispenser and the fact that it isn&#x27;t oily nor does it dry up and leave my skin tight.  It is an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a day almost every day with no breakouts. It really helps diminish the bags under my eyes and helps with my dark circles, I can always tell if a skip a day. A little goes a long why so be mindful only to use a little. I use it in conjunction with their mask and I will definitely buy it again. Like I said before we should all keep in mind that not every product works for everyone and it takes longer for some people to notice a lasting change.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for night use.  Really helped with puffiness.  But couldn&#x27;t wear under makeup, it peels.  Still great product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and they dry and crack and hurt easily. This product does not cause any irritations to my eyes and works for the sensitive skin. Just takes a dab and you&#x27;re ready to go. The skin around my eyes feels softer and more healthy than it did before using this product. Good quality product!</li>
    <li> Major props to Swiss Botany for this amazing eye serum!  I had two issues with my eyes - wrinkles and dark circles. After reading the great reviews on this serum, I gave it a shot, admittedly a tad skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is clear and glides on smooth with a refreshing cooling effect. There was no burning or any adverse reaction at all.  After only 11 days, there is a HUGE difference in the appearance of my wrinkles, although not so much on the dark circles (hence only for stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product for anyone out there that wants to decrease the appearance of wrinkles around their eyes! Although the product does state it reduces dark circles, I didn&#x27;t see a difference in that aspect, so don&#x27;t expect much change there.</li>
    <li> I rate it as 3 over 5 it is because I am using it for 2 weeks now and I dont see any progress yet... I will post again after 1 month of using it.&lt;br /&gt;The box contains 1 eye gel and two other small bottles vit c serum and hydrating mask which I dont know how to use and when to use it. There is no instruction except the one on the box for the eye gel.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to apply and absorbs quickly. It does seem to have lifted and lightened my under-eye area.</li>
