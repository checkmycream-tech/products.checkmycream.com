<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Still available as Listerine Gentle Gum Care Woven Floss so there is no need to pay inflated prices!</li>
    <li> Was the best product around. Now discontinued but marketed by Listerene.</li>
    <li> Dentist gave me a sample &amp; I really like the way it works.  Much better than cheap dental floss.  Really cleans between your teeth better than any floss on the market &amp; well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Yes! but only with this floss. I was introduced to it by getting samples from my dentist. My favorite floss ever. Recently, it&#x27;s very difficult to find in stores so I went back to the previous types of floss. They do the job but it&#x27;s not something I look forward to as it just doesn&#x27;t feel good on my gums. I searched for this on Amazon, found it and a few days later, I&#x27;m happy to report that flossing is once again a pleasant ritual. The price is great. I ordered the pack of 6 and delivery was prompt. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of waxed or un waxed regular floss (like using piano wire). This floss is nearly impossible to find in retail stores.  Thanks Amazon for stocking this.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this floss that my dentist had recommended after checking several stores. I found it on Amazon, made the purchase, and received it promptly. Makes me wonder why I bother spending the time and effort to hunt something down when I should be checking amazon.com first! Love the floss and the minty flavor.</li>
    <li> i am glad i found this floss on amazon.this is a hard product to find in stores .this price was a little cheaper than when i find it in stores (which is not often.)my family likes this woven floss better than that waxed floss and i agree.will be getting from here in the future</li>
    <li> When Johnson&amp;Johnson sadly decided to discontinue its woven type of floss either late last year or early 2013, I was despondent.  It&#x27;s the ONLY floss I like, and that works for me, and no one else makes it.  I bought the last few packages from various stores over the past months, but every store&#x27;s stock was ending, and there would be no new supply.  Then I learned that I could order it from Amazon, so I did -- 12 packages!  I&#x27;m good for quite a while now, and am hopeful that, when I do exhaust this supply, either J&amp;J has decided to start making it again, that someone else has decided to make it, or that there is still more here for me to order.</li>
    <li> This floss is worth the additional price.  It was recommended to me by my dental hygienist; it does a much better job that regular waxed floss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this floss is no longer available at drugstores, but this is definitely the best floss ever. This is the floss than makes me want to floss. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I too bought this because the woven floss is no longer available at any of the local drugstores.  The floss itself is fine, but the little plastic boxes aren&#x27;t.  Not only do they not look like the photo, they don&#x27;t snap shut like the ones I&#x27;ve bought in the stores; in fact the hinge on the \\&quot;lid\\&quot; is very stiff and the lid doesn&#x27;t shut at all.  Not really a problem in your medicine cabinet, but a deal breaker in a travel bag.  I will have to put tape over the lids to travel with these, and I bought a dozen so I will be traveling with them for a while.  YMMV as it&#x27;s entirely possible that these come from different sources at different times (mine say \\&quot;manufactured in the US and Dominican Republic\\&quot; despite the claim that they are \\&quot;made in USA\\&quot;).  Edit:  Most of the little plastic boxes are OK.  The first couple were defective as described (weird coincidence I guess) but the others have been fine.</li>
    <li> The very best product for part of your oral care regiment.</li>
    <li> The non-flouride version of this floss is an excellent product but I cannot use the flouride impregnated version.  After only three days I had painful sores develop  on my lips at the corners of my mouth.  This was especially surprising since I have no know allergies or sensitivities.  It is especially frustrating that the non-flouride is often not available.</li>
    <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson has stopped making the mint only version because dentist&#x27;s recommend the floride version.  There are plenty of parts of the country (mine included) that don&#x27;t have floride included in their water and even if they do this floss helps get it in between the teeth, an area prone to cavities.</li>
    <li> Gotta say, when Amazon sent me an email saying my floss was available, and I looked at the page, the picture shows the non-fluoride version, and that&#x27;s what I thought I was ordering. Especially considering it&#x27;s the non-fluoride version that is in my notification list. I guess didn&#x27;t read the item title. Doh! So much for that money. BTW: I&#x27;m not an anti-fluoride freak, but added fluoride is not necessary for adults. We get plenty in our water.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss I use and have used for some time. I get good marks at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think this floss gets as much out of your teeth as Glide, but tastes good!</li>
    <li> So...\\&quot;It&#x27;s ONLY floss?\\&quot;  Not true at all!!!...this is such a superior product that I buy it in large lots in the fear that Johnson and Johnson might quit making it.  I have NOT been able to find it in retail stores for many years and can only purchase it on-line...thankfully...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW...what is so great about this??  Unlike &#x27;regular&#x27; floss, this product is NOT waxy but instead, is woven of several strands of thread.  To me the difference in the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of it as I floss is very different.  I&#x27;d describe it as having some &#x27;tooth&#x27; or &#x27;grab&#x27; that really allows me to feel when I have each surface clean.  The waxy styles do not give me that level of &#x27;feedback&#x27; when I use them....which is NOT that often, as you may have guessed..!!</li>
    <li> I believe woven floss is superior to any other.  My first woven floss was without fluoride.  I have switched to this floss with fluoride because I drink only bottled water. I am opposed to fluoridation of the water supply (which ours is); I will not even give fluoridated water to my dogs.  I believe topical application (such as with this floss) is much healthier and more effective.</li>
    <li> I bought these after trying a small sample from my dental hygenist.  At first this took some getting used to, since it essentially has two different strands woven together.  The floss breaks more often than other flosses I have tried, but I feel I am getting better flossing</li>
    <li> For some reason I have been unable to find this product locally.  I can now get it whenever I need it, thanks.</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is.  You can&#x27;t seem to get this stuff anywhere except online any more, not sure why.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of Glide floss for years and thought I&#x27;d try this brand. Mistake! It&#x27;s way too thick and it shreds like bark off a dead tree. Not something you want between your teeth. It was &#x27;usable&#x27; after washing off the floss, making it thinner but floppy. I&#x27;m stuck with 6 packs. Bummer.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this specific kind, which can be hard to find in the drugstores. Woven floss apparently is better than just your typical floss because it soaks up the plaque. My dental check-ups are spotless now after switching to this. I now exclusively buy this kind of floss. It also feels soft on the gums. It&#x27;s a little pricier than some floss, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I prefer woven floss, but could not find on shelves anywhere.  So glad to be weaving again instead of waxing.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss in existence. It consists of multiple woven fibers that do not cut into the gums and clean thoroughly. Especially excellent for people with severely recessed gums, who have a significant open spaces between the gums and the teeth. I&#x27;m also grateful that Amazon continues to carry this product, since I, like others here, have problems getting it in drug stores. Although not especially inexpensive, it&#x27;s great to be able to buy multiple boxes at a time.</li>
    <li> I think this floss is good. It is gentle on my gums which is excellent for me. This floss makes me actually like flossing because it is gentle on my gums. I like the flavor too which is always nice. I only had two complaints with this floss. I felt like when I flossed it would get stuck between my teeth. This didn&#x27;t happen always thankfully. My other complaint is that I thought the floss would tear between my teeth easily which is not good. No one likes having floss bits between their teeth. Overall though I still like it but I just had a couple of complaints.</li>
    <li> You would think that a woven floss would be too thick to easily fit between teeth but it does...  The product came quickly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Love it! Don&#x27;t understand why you cant find this in local stores. This is just what the dentist wants me to use.</li>
    <li> Very good service.  Exactly what I expected and what I ordered.  Received well-packaged and on time.  I would order from them again.</li>
    <li> I prefer this slightly rough floss to the waxed or glide types.  I imagine that the more fibers there are, the more surfaces there are to clean out the tartar. (Instead of just slicing through it, or moving it around.)    Like some other reviewers, I gave up on finding it in local stores, even though I think it&#x27;s J&amp;J&#x27;s best floss.</li>
    <li> Best floss there is, in fact i can&#x27;t understand why this isn&#x27;t the standard design as it is infinitely superior to the nasty cheese wire design of all others.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  Not sure why it is not still in the stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this floss for a couple of years. Its great for sensitive gums and the woven material really grabs the food particles.</li>
    <li> Woven floss works good to remove more plaque.    This floss works well but it compresses and gets thin-stringy before finishing all teeth.    So you end up using more floss.    Price is very good, however, for this floss.</li>
    <li> The best floss I have ever used. It has been recommended by the dentist and is very comfortable to use</li>
    <li> This floss cleans my teeth super-well because it sticks well to the plaque.  I will never go back to Glide!</li>
    <li> These are quite nice and are the ones that my dentist recommended.  The only issue I have is that the strands might break apart sometimes and I will get a tiny strand stuck in my teeth.  It is a nightmare trying to get it out!  I pretty much have to floss to remove the floss.</li>
    <li> I use this product which is most effective at removing tartar. My dentist recommended it and I have been using it for about seven years. It works much better than conventional waxed floss. I am now having a difficult time finding it in local stores, so I buy it online.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shred easily and squeaks when my teeth and gum are clean. My dentist &amp; hygienist both recommended this hard to find floss.</li>
    <li> Very pleased I was able to buy this multi-pack as they quit selling it in the local stores.  It is the only floss that does not shred between my teeth and that actually removes build-up.  Fantastic product.  Shipping time was excellent as well.</li>
    <li> This floss is the kind recommended by my dentist and I can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere.  Target used to have it but not recently.  Decently priced online, and good service on delivery.</li>
    <li> It is great if you have wider spaces between some teeth, like I do. Otherwise, for tightly packed teeth it may be inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;I found regular thin floss to be inadequate and difficult to use in wider spaces or bridge-work.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this, and it is difficult to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I like this particular product but it has dissappeared from our local store&#x27;s shelves.  I was glad to find it on line and even more so that it was free shipping.</li>
    <li> So here i was all this time flossing with normal waxed floss and was missing out on this wonderful floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently got braces put on and tried to use this floss with a threader and I have to say its been a mess, Not saying its the flosses fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy a 6 pack of these and it really wasn&#x27;t all that cheap. Either way the floss was great when I didn&#x27;t have braces and will remain my go to floss once my braces come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife really loved the overall feel of the floss when its between her teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also comment on the issue of the floss getting very slippery once wet. Some say its because of the fluoride but i cannot attest to whether or not this is the cause of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your in the market for new floss then give this a try.</li>
    <li> likke others, i can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore for some reason, but i also can&#x27;t go back to regular floss, this is so much better than waxed floss. easier to grip, they don&#x27;t slip out of my fingers when i&#x27;m trying to floss back teeth (i still have all of my wisdom teeth, so i have to get waaayyy back there) and the woven texture feels like it&#x27;s really getting in between teeth to help clean. i&#x27;ve had problems with gum disease in the past, and this helps keep that at bay. thanks</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what we wanted and also was shipped to us in a timely fashion.  We will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> There is no doubt this is the best floss I have ever used. I hate the thin white ribbons that hurt and cut your gums when you force it to the smaller gaps between your teeth. This is just the opposite, true to its name; it is the most gentle on your gums as it is made of hundreds of micro strands. The woven micro strands are cotton soft; they easily conform to the smallest gaps between your teeth and slides through with ease. They catch more food because they have lots of spaces between the strands. You can also really feel and taste the mint flavor which is quite refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss cuts easily with the built-in cutter. And lastly, they do not slip that much between your fingers when you are flossing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product first from Pharmapacks. Instead of dental floss I received 3 packages of Zicam cold remedy.... So I shipped those back. Pharmapacks was very nice about refunding me quickly. I think re-placed the order with Amazon directly with my Prime account and had the dental floss within 2 days and all was well. The product works better than waxed floss and it is cheaper than buying individual packages at the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this type of floss. Gone from all retail stores. Does a better job cleaning between the teeth than the flat ribbon or thin string flosses.</li>
    <li> Works well and the price was right. Been using this floss for years, and I find it works best for my teeth</li>
    <li> I live in a small town in Alaska.  I have periodontal disease. It is imparitive that I floss at this point I need woven floss to recover from intense cleaning. Woven is far superior in my opinion. I am 57 years young.</li>
    <li> I prefer this to the plastic strip floss because it seems more gentle on my gums and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; into them.  I like the fact that it has the fluoride in it so I&#x27;m treating my teeth in-between while I floss.</li>
    <li> Very effective woven floss with good shred resistance. Unless you have rough, very tight contacts that would require a waxed floss or Glide product to get between your teeth, this floss will be very effective at cleaning between your teeth.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that the product didn&#x27;t match the picture but it appears to be close enough to what I ordered.  Like another reviewer, maybe it is the &#x27;with Flouride&#x27; that makes this different.  What I received was a package with pink accents with &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; written on the pink part.  At any rate, I get sample sizes of this at my dentist and cannot find it anywhere so ordered from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this floss and have used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are extremely close together.&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to get floss between them without fraying.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this floss do the job but it also gets some FLUORIDE between them.&lt;br /&gt;Between my teeth used to be the only place I had cavities before I started using this version of Reach floss.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this floss.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this anymore- it&#x27;s our favorite so if you find it at a decent rate, stock up.</li>
    <li> I love this kind of floss. It&#x27;s real gentle. Its not a piece pf plastic that might give you bleeding gums. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> This floss is not like the usual plastic or waxy string that seems to dominate the dental isle now. It&#x27;s woven thread and is much more effective at cleaning in between teeth.</li>
    <li> I went to replenish my stash of the woven floss, and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores or online.  I waited a few weeks and tried again, and still nothing.  I panicked and called J&amp;J, and they assured me the product hasn&#x27;t been discontinued.  Whew!  There was some sort of production disruption a few months ago, and it&#x27;s still not back in production.  They claim they should be shipping soon, but don&#x27;t have a date.  They&#x27;d better ship soon - I only have one package left.  I am a twice a day flosser, and would be miserable if I couldn&#x27;t get this any more.  It&#x27;s the best.  You&#x27;d think that a woven floss would just be for people with space between their teeth, but this is the best floss for tightly packed teeth. ALL other flosses shred or get stuck between my teeth (unwaxed, waxed, Glide, Ultraclean, etc - I&#x27;ve tried them all). I wouldn&#x27;t have picked up this one on my own, since my gums are in great shape, but my dentist recommended it for my super-tight teeth, and I&#x27;m amazed at how pleasant it is to use.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and can&#x27;t wait to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Do your gums a favor and get this. I have no idea why it is not used by everyone. No more pain, damaging and cutting your gums.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this floss disappears in stores, but it does. Love having 5-6 backups in my bathroom cabinet. And the price is a little better too.</li>
    <li> This type of floss keeps getting stuck between my teeth.  I guess the woven floss is suppose to be more gentle on the gums, but it&#x27;s more of a hassle to use.</li>
    <li> This floss is AMAZING! I have some deeper pockets in my gums and historically food can collect there and cause not only tooth and gum problems but really bad odor (I&#x27;m sure you experienced this from other people, if not yourself). This floss delivers fluoride into those areas and keeps your gums healthy and protects your teeth. I keep telling my dentist that he should make a bigger deal to his patients and the dental community about the effect that this product has, but so far he hasn&#x27;t bothered- to my amazement. The fact is, for the three years or so that I&#x27;ve been using THIS floss, I have no odors coming from any gum pockets AND they haven&#x27;t gotten any deeper (worse).</li>
    <li> I love this floss and can only get it at Walgreens and sometimes they are out.  So, I will be buying the 6 pack pkgs online from now on.</li>
    <li> This floss is the best ever.  It really gets in between the teeth and you can feel and hear it sliding against your teeth removing any particles.  My dentist appointments and cleaning have improved since I switched to this floss.  Don&#x27;t use GLIDE-It does just what the name states - GLIDE....right over particles and does not help your gums either.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of floss for a couple years now, always buying it in the store. I thought I would save some money by buying bulk online. But there is something wrong with this floss. It&#x27;s not braided well, so it shreds and breaks when running it through my teeth. Also, the flouride coating rubs off on my fingers. I don&#x27;t know if Reach quality control has tanked or if this is just an unlucky batch of rejects, but I won&#x27;t be buying this online ever again.</li>
    <li> I prefer this thicker floss and finding it in an actual store is difficult.  The size of the dispenser is good for me.</li>
    <li> Not only great for teeth, but if you swallow one end of it and let your digestive system pull it through, you can also do a &amp;#34;full body&amp;#34; floss!</li>
    <li> I have older teeth with gaps and receding gums, and this floss is the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that really does the job for me. It&#x27;s hard to find locally ~ plus, being in my 70&#x27;s with an old car too ~ so it is wonderful that it can come directly to me at my home! I&#x27;m glad to know where I can easily get it from now on. I highly recommend this product. Packing was great, delivery was quick enough (ha! considering the weather!) and I am very pleased. Great product, great seller.</li>
    <li> Recommended and used by my dental hygienist, I thought this rope like floss would get stuck in between my very tight teeth. It rarely does. My hygienist said the teflon coated flosses just slid right over the top of plaque. This one has helped my gums and teeth to be far healthier and less painful.There is no more blood after dental cleanings! Been using it for 3 or 4 years now... It&#x27;s worth the extra money it costs!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this floss. I tried to buy this product on Walgreens or rite aids but is almost impossible. I never found it. I know that is more expensive than other floss, but it&#x27;s really gentle to the Gum.</li>
    <li> Works much better than wax coated floss.  Can be hard to find in stores for some reason.  Best floss on the market.</li>
    <li> This product is often hard to find in stores.  It works well for us and does not shread.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous types of floss since I was unable to find the woven type in stores anymore, and they all were very uncomfortable to use and in some cases, caused injury to my gums.  The woven floss is gentle and cleans between (and under bridges) superbly.  And it leaves a fresh taste afterwards because it is mint flavored.</li>
    <li> This item is the best dental floss for me since I have sensitive gums. It does not bruise my gums and cleans thoroughly. It is not an easy find at stores so it was convenient to buy it in bulk form.</li>
    <li> This floss is great and was recommended by my dentist.  For some reason it is difficult to  find in local stores.  I live just outside Little Rock, AR and am able to buy it on Amazon with ease.  Due to its woven nature it cleans better and is easier to handle than the usual wax covered version.</li>
    <li> I like this because it has a surface unlike the slick, Teflon like, flosses that glide over your teeth and the bacteria. Since I can&#x27;t buy it anymore for a reasonable price at a drug store I have to get it here. Does save me time and gas money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fluoride addition, I could live without, but I understand.</li>
    <li> I love this floss. It sounds gross, but it really gets all that crap out from between your teeth. It&#x27;s easier to use than waxed floss, which is important to me because my teeth are crowded and waxed floss can get stuck, while extra-slippery floss never feels like it does much. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I saw the great reviews and bought a 6 pack. The floss did not work as my teeth are tightly spaced. * The floss would get stuck and very difficult to pull out. It would also shred leaving pieces stuck in teeth. * When the floss gets wet, it&#x27;s slippery and difficult to use.  Try it before you invest in a pack of six. I am going back to Glide.</li>
    <li> Recently received a free sample of this floss from my dentist. It&#x27;s more fun to use than my old brand (smoother, has a nice flavor along with the fluoride -- anything to make flossing more fun!); received the item quickly from the vendor; the price was fair. Would do business with them again.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this floss. She said it should help prevent cavities between my teeth. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, I like the minty flavor and it seems to work well.  I&#x27;ll update after my next cleaning.</li>
    <li> I know its odd to get excited about dental floss, but this stuff is like nothing else when it come to clean teeth! My dental hygienist recommended this stuff about a year ago, and the positive results at my last cleaning were all i needed to convince me.</li>
    <li> To me, it&#x27;s like this: if you wanted to paint a wall, would you choose a paint brush with only one bristle or a normal one with hundreds of bristles? Why floss with a single filament? &amp;#34;Woven&amp;#34; is gentler and cleans more thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to add the following to all my reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware! Some &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; will trash a product for no reason simply because they are paid to or because they sell competitive products. Other &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; will give products - that they have never seen and never used - glowing 5 star ratings - for a fee.  Some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Perfect product, 30% less expensive than Walgreens.  With my prime membership, I never have to worry about being out of floss for long.</li>
    <li> The reason of the 4 rating is due to a change in the fibre.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as good as the previous wooven floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speacially where people with sensitive gums are concerned but, this one is the best in the market at this time.</li>
    <li> Easy on the gums, easy to use, hard to find at the store. So glad to be able to order it on line</li>
    <li> Far and away the best dental floss I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m sure that if I had had this product available sooner  I would have been spared a great deal of dental work.</li>
    <li> I typically use Glide dental tape but I tried this when they stopped offering Glide in 50m dispensers. What a mistake! As others have mentioned this stuff tends to shred when used. Definitely would not buy again.</li>
    <li> It works well if you have relatively larger gap between your teeth. Otherwise it breaks apart. Order only one at first or buy it at store and try it.</li>
    <li> I really like this floss. I feel like it does a good job of cleaning my teeth without being difficult to handle. It has fluoride on it so it gets fluoride between my teeth. And it&#x27;s not waxed -- I never feel like waxed floss does a good job.</li>
    <li> This is great dental floss and hard to find locally.  Ended up giving away some so others could try it and that I also accidentally bought way more than I intended.  Oh well, I have stock for the next 2 years or so.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the service provided by this vendor.  Additionally, it is very difficult to find this dental floss and it&#x27;s the only one I will use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, the oral hygienist hasn&#x27;t complained since I started using this. The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t come in 200-yard packs - 4 50-yard packs produce a lot more plastic garbage.</li>
    <li> I hate to floss my teeth. Some of my teeth are close together, some far apart. This multi strand floss does the best job of any I have ever used. Sometimes I can&#x27;t find it in the store and when I do, it is expensive. This is the best product at the best price.</li>
    <li> Flossing is one of the most important daily healthcare routines! Make it easy in yourself and use this excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great tasting floss that is particularly good for people with periodontal issues.  Super gentle on gums.  Woven fibre catches way more plaque and food than traditional single strand floss.</li>
    <li> Best floss on the market. Forget that slippery stuff, this floss has some width to it and has a rougher texture. You don&#x27;t need to fear pork ribs and corn on the cob any more</li>
    <li> Best floss by far!  Cleans very well between every tooth.  My hygenist highly recommends.  Don&#x27;t understand&lt;br /&gt;why Johnson &amp; Johnson doesn&#x27;t have it available in the stores like CVS, Walgreens, etc.?  It would be the&lt;br /&gt;store&#x27;s top selling floss, which surely would be good for J &amp; J.</li>
    <li> I doubt that the flouride in this floss is of much theraputic value, but the fact that the floss is woven renders its cleaning ability far superior to stranded floss.</li>
    <li> I really wish I didn&#x27;t buy so much of this stuff. I guess I have been spoiled by floss that glides!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for the thicker thread type floss and even though the package looked different this was it.  It just feels like it grabs better, unlike those thin ribbon types.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this floss, but eventually had problems with it as my teeth are so narrow - it tended to shred and I found bits of floss in my teeth (ugh).  HOWEVER, my loss was my husband&#x27;s gain - he just LOVES this floss - says it&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s ever used, so it worked out OK for him.</li>
    <li> I really hate this floss. It usually seems to shred when I&#x27;m using it. I do like REACH floss, but I&#x27;m going back to the waxed one.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m really weird about dental floss. And I found it really hard to tell what the floss is like from descriptions. This is a non-glossed set of strings woven together. I really like it. It grips your teeth well and gets all the crap out. No sliding around like with glossed stuff and doesn&#x27;t bit into your fingers either.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I love it b/c now I have enough for 3 lifetimes</li>
    <li> This floss picks up more than any other floss I&#x27;ve ever used. The woven floss creates a way to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; your teeth, came highly recommended by my dentist, and is WAY gentler on my gums. I will never go back to another floss again.</li>
    <li> I was crushed when this floss free of poison fluoride was discontinued until its forcing me to try others helped me find even better -- the original dental floss, P.O.H. (Personal Oral Hygiene), on Amazon including fluoride-free and wax-free (dentist advises v. wax build up) &amp; in super thin strong, or medium strong, or thick woven fibers making flossing faster &amp; easier than ever so I avoid it less! :D</li>
    <li> High quality, for sure.  HOWEVER, it doesn&#x27;t fit into tight spaces.  It works great on my upper jaw, but my lower jaw is really tightly packed.  I have to use Glide for my lower jaw.  Once I run out of Reach, I&#x27;ll probably just use Glide for everything.  In short, buy this if you don&#x27;t have tight gaps between your teeth.</li>
    <li> Floss ratings definitely depend on the person&#x27;s teeth that is reviewing it.  For anyone that has space between your teeth, this is probably choice floss.  Because of that, I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 stars.  I personally have no space between my teeth. Trying to get this floss between my molars takes some hard bargaining.  When I finally do get it in there the force I&#x27;ve used has cracked against my gums and I usually start bleeding.  So don&#x27;t get this if your teeth spacings are narrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I&#x27;ll fault this floss with is coming apart easy.  I can barely get through one row of teeth before the twine starts coming undone.  What that means is this floss is actually multiple threads twined together.  Using it causes the twine to come apart.</li>
    <li> Excellent floss, worth adopting for daily use. Fluoride is a plus.</li>
    <li> i love this product, but it comes smelling like cinnamon like they stored the minty stuff and the cinnamon stuff right next to each other..for a longggg time</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floss. It may feel like rope, but it also makes you feel extra clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> I refuse to use any other floss! Super gentle on my gums and doesn&#x27;t cause bleeding, what more can I ask for. Flossing isn&#x27;t so bad when I have this. Too bad I can&#x27;t find it in any stores and have to order it.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss ever because it is woven floss. Waxed floss slips off your fingers really easily, so is hard to work with. Woven floss holds to your fingers much better. It also cleans your teeth much better. Waxed floss is too thin.</li>
    <li> Package of 6 was ripped opened within the box packing and only 5 of the units were in it, not 6. Looked like someone had ripped open and take one out. Disappointing in that I paid for 6, not 5, so feel a bit ripped off.</li>
    <li> For some reason this is so very hard to find in any of the stores around me. Love that I can order this online and for a great price! This is my second order!  My dentist (and me!) are very happy!</li>
    <li> WalMart quit carrying this floss a few years back and the only place I could find it at the time was on EBay. I bought hundreds of samples from a vendor there and that has got me thru to today. I was so relieved to see that it was still on market and I gladly bought these. They arrived faster than expected...in like 2 days. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This floss is the best available, when it&#x27;s available. The woven texture is easy to grasp and control and provides more fibers to clean the space between teeth.  It&#x27;s generally not available in the drug stores or supermarkets in my area, so I finally resorted to buying from Amazon.  Great, arrived quickly and was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> this is a kind of floss my dentist wants me to use, but it is difficult to find.  I am glad I can get it online, and that it gets there so quickly.</li>
    <li> Has better friction for removing food from my teeth.  Good when space between teeth is wider.  Strong string so it does not break while flossing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dedicated flosser and this is the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used.  it&#x27;s hard to get in drug stores and Amazon&#x27;s prices are better anyway.</li>
    <li> My favorite floss ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have very tight spaces between my teeth, so most other flosses cause some discomfort when having to push them in between my teeth. But because the Reach Gentle Gum floss is woven, it provides more &amp;#34;give&amp;#34;/cushion, and is as effective.</li>
    <li> My preference for floss is Reach Deep Clean which has unfortunately been discontinued!  This floss doesn&#x27;t even come close.  I can still see plaque even after flossing twice in a row with this floss.  The Reach Deep Clean did a great job with just one pass in my hardest to reach teeth.  Please bring back Reach Deep Clean.</li>
    <li> Vastly superior in so many ways to ordinary floss, including the color; if you are still getting visible white junk on the floss from between your teeth, you know you still have more cleaning to do and can keep going back over the same spaces until you know they are clean. Regular white floss will not show you this.&lt;br /&gt;They have changed the name and color over the years, from blue-green &amp;#34;Clean Paste&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Deep Clean&amp;#34; blue-green to now pink &amp;#34;Gum Care.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t find it in the stores so I have to order 6 at a time from Amazon and am so happy I can buy it.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find this woven floss where I live, and when I do, it is expensive.  Buying in bulk and spending enough to qualify for free shipping makes getting this through Amazon a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best floss available. It is, as the name implies, easy on the gums, but its texture also makes it very effective for removing food particles from between the teeth. I wish there were an option without the mint, but I usually just use a tissue to pull some of the excess off the floss before use. Once you&#x27;ve used this floss, others will not do. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> If you need thicker floss for your gums this is the one to get. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> This is hard to find in stores.  Woven floss is good for getting into larger spaces.  Glad I could get this without having to drive all over town looking for it!</li>
    <li> Great minty taste and my hygenist recommended it as a great product for oral care.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in town so ordered it online.</li>
    <li> The dentist office always give me dental tape, no matter where I go. BUT, this is THE floss to use. At least for me, after trying SO MANY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s thick, so you don&#x27;t put pressure on just one area and damage that part of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s woven, meaning many tiny threads, meaning more ways to capture and remove plaques and food particles.&lt;br /&gt;3. Coated with fluoride for smooth motions&lt;br /&gt;4. Coated with fluoride for extra fluoride protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find, so once, I gave up and used something else. I always got the quick &amp;#34;great, see you in 6 month.&amp;#34; This time, the hygienist accused me of slacking on my flossing. I wasn&#x27;t. Just different floss.</li>
    <li> An absolutely excellent floss!  Instead of one waxed strand, several interwoven strands can get out every pesky particle between your teeth, leaving a clean rminty taste in your mouth.  Overpriced on Amazon though, compared to supermarkets.</li>
    <li> this floss is recommended by periodontists because it does the job well!  I highly recommend that people with perio problems use it</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended, and what better way to get it than in bulk and Primed!  I like the flavor and is supposed to be more effective.</li>
    <li> As a RDH I will say that this is the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used. Waxed floss glides over the plaque w/o necessarily removing it while this floss has the surface texture needed to remove soft deposits easily. It took less time to do a thorough full-mouth flossing with the Reach Gum Care Woven floss than it does when I use traditional floss: waxed or unwaxed. The taste was terrific. For those having trouble with snagging: check with your dentist to see if there are old, rough fillings that need replacing; the problem isn&#x27;t the floss, it&#x27;s the surface of the teeth.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, even at $6.00 a pop.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to purchase woven dental floss. It really is gentle!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t find this in stores. It is an exceptional aid to keeping your teeth storg!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this floss that I actually floss more often when I have it. My teeth are close together at the top of the tooth, but have more space down by the gum, and this is the only floss that gets through the tight spots easily and still feels thick enough to clean around the gums. I never really feel as if waxy flosses are getting all the little bits out, and other woven flosses snag and break. Non-waxy, non-woven flosses are so hard to force between my teeth that I sometimes end up hurting my gums with them. But this floss is great. It&#x27;s actually a pleasure to use. Before I could find it on Amazon, I once drove an hour out of my way to get two packs from the last CVS in the area that had it in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the packaging. The instructions tell you it&#x27;s important not to pull *up* when you&#x27;re cutting off a length of floss, and this is important. If you pull up, eventually you&#x27;re going to pull the whole roll of floss out, and it&#x27;ll go rolling off across your bathroom. I wish they&#x27;d revamp the packaging so that you didn&#x27;t have to be quite so careful when using it. However, the floss is so great that it&#x27;s still a 5-star product.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this to me. After trying it, it is the only one I&#x27;ll use. Feels great on my gums and gets everything squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> I have nothing to add. Seems to provide good traction and the floss does not cut into my fingers as some of the very fine floss does.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of \\&quot;Woven Dental Floss\\&quot; before I placed my order on here. The fact that it is woven dental floss, and that it has fluoride, are awesome to me! My first use of this dental floss was a real eye opener. I really can feel the floss between my teeth and gums, and it is thicker than the wax version of dental floss, so it cleans in between teeth better. Knowing that I don&#x27;t have to keep going in between each tooth several times before I know that I&#x27;ve gotten everything out is great too! I really like this floss for my family and I. I know that this floss will keep our teeth healthier, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> We had been using this floss for years.  Then we were unable to locate it in the drug stores.  So delighted we found it on amazon.  This floss is nice and gentle for people who have delicate gums.  I would recommend it to anyone.  The price is reasonable too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this floss based on the excellent reviews for it&#x27;s purpose of being a great floss for sensitive teeth.  My disappointment is because it completely shreds every time I use it &amp; it actually gets stuck between my teeth which causes me to use a different brand of floss to remove this one.  Maybe my teeth are more tightly placed than others are, so it is probably great for anyone with sensitive/generously spaced teeth--but unfortunately not in my case.  I purchased the value pack so I&#x27;ll just have to throw away all 6 of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this floss for years. The texture really cleans everything off your teeth, no wax and you know you&#x27;ve cleaned your teeth.  I could no longer find it in local retail stores so I  tried Amazon.com. They came through, again! My daughter also orders it from Amazon. I&#x27;m only puzzled at Johnson-Johnson, why make this hard to find?</li>
    <li> This was the very best product....WHY they discontinued it, I&#x27;ll never understand.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it is brought back. But the cinammon flavor Listerine woven floss is a&lt;br /&gt;decent replacement.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I prefer this product to any floss I have ever used for cleaning and comfort.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in stores and it&#x27;s the floss my dentist recommends. Arrived in very short time. My only criticism is that it was packaged in unnecessarily excessive amount of plastic wrap. But good service and product.</li>
    <li> The best floss. Cleans between teeth better than the &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; flosses.  Spread some toothpaste on it before flossing for even cleaner teeth.</li>
    <li> Best floss there is, plain and simple.  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so difficult to find.</li>
    <li> Excellent floss, gentle on gums and really cleans.  I like it as is squeaks when the surface of the tooth is clean.</li>
    <li> Have been using the brand for a number of years and always loved it. I still like it but it seems to be a bit thinner, perhaps omitting one or two if the woven strands.</li>
    <li> It cleans the space between my teeth and gums really well.  What else do you want from floss?  Buy it.</li>
    <li> What good floss this is!</li>
    <li> all the walgreens and cvs dont carry this superior floss anymore. This is the best floss on the planet! the woven floss gets plaque much better than any other floss. i am so glad it is still being made and cant understand why people dont buy it. always have to order thru amazon. running out now, gotta get my order in now before i run out, which is a nightmare! it might occasionally shred on a rough tooth surface but everything in this world has its pros and cons. with this product, the pros out way the cons by a massive degree.</li>
    <li> It really penetrates deeply in the gum and does the job excellently. I definitely will continue to use.  Much better than the regular floss&lt;br /&gt;products.</li>
    <li> I have used this dental hygeine product for several years running. Formerly, it was available in 100 yard professional dispensers, but now is apparently only available in the consumber 50 yard version. The 50 yard version drives the price up and the current price is enough to make me go looking for a generic substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has no wax and is just a little \\&quot;furry.\\&quot; Those two properties allow it to be soft and kind to gums and, in addition, the furriness allows it to catch onto particles of food, etc., and remove these particles from between the teeth. Although other flosses, such as the plain white floss (in narrow, medium, or wide) will work, this product is just a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flossing your teeth, at least once a day, (they say) will help keep your teeth and cumgs healthier and cleaner and I am a believer in that philosophy. I&#x27;ll keep using it, unless they jack up the price any higher.</li>
    <li> I love this dental floss. Cleans better than anything else on the market!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that keeps my teeth clean while flossing without hurting sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> OUTSTANDING PRODUCT. Does a really great job and makes my teeth feel great. EXPENSIVE, but the best type I&#x27;ve found for really getting plaque out and keeping my gums healthy.</li>
    <li> I originally started using this floss because my dentist gave me a sample.  It was so much better than Glide or any of the other types that I went shopping for more.  For some reason, you can&#x27;t find this particular floss at any retailer where I&#x27;ve looked, which annoyed me no end.  Anyway, I went on line and was delighted I could get these in quantity.  I certainly hope they don&#x27;t quit making this floss, because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever found for getting plaque. It&#x27;s a little bit pricey, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Not as gentle as their old woven floss</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the stores any longer.  This is my favorite dental floss.  My teeth have tight contacts.  Since it&#x27;s woven, it&#x27;s the only dental floss that doesn&#x27;t break or shread as I pull it between my teeth.  Plus, unlike Oral-B Glide, it actually feels like the floss is cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend ... it&#x27;s MUCH better than waxed floss at keeping my teeth and bones clean and healthy.  Finding it in stores is difficult, but buying online is easy!</li>
    <li> Hard to get too excited about floss but this stuff is way better than regular floss and none of the stores near me carry it for some reason. Amazon to the rescue!</li>
    <li> I got this because of the fluoride. The string is pretty wimpy and can splinter off. I wish they made Glide with fluoride.</li>
    <li> This is a medium thick round braided type of floss. It works well and is easy to use. It may be hard to use of your teeth fit very tightly together.</li>
    <li> I love this dental floss.....I know this sounds a little extreme but I&#x27;m a lot more likely to actually floss my teeth and not skip it when I have this gentle floss on hand.</li>
    <li> was recommended by my dentist because I always get cavities between my teeth. Love it!</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I prefer this dental floss - gentler on the gums and gets the job done.  Strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good Buy its hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> Have used this for years, but no longer available in store. Gentle, yet strong enough to do the job.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist for gum health instead of the gentle glide floss, this is supposed to &amp;#34;rough up&amp;#34; the gums and make them less susceptible to disease.  I did not have any bleeding, but my teeth are close together and the floss sometimes comes apart.</li>
    <li> This is the only &amp;#34;woven&amp;#34; floss available anymore (that I am aware of)----and it&#x27;s hard to find sometimes! That&#x27;s why I decided to order this 6-pack when I saw it on Amazon. My dentist recommended it about 15 years ago, telling me that it would be more effective for flossing and removing plaque than all of the &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; waxed flosses ---and it is!  I will never switch! I&#x27;m not sure why they call it &amp;#34;gentle gum care&amp;#34;  floss.</li>
    <li> I HATE THIS FLOSS. I can&#x27;t belive they are making this terrible floss. I wanted a floss with fluoride and strangely this was the only one I could find (WHY is that???) I hate mint floss and unwaxed but gave this a try. I&#x27;ve been using plain old glide for many years. This shreds, it&#x27;s STICKY, very, very STICKY it&#x27;s woven and there are two \\&quot;stings\\&quot; it&#x27;s very hard to get this in between you&#x27;re teeth unless you have huge gaps, it gets stuck and you have to use tweezers to get the pieces of string out from in between your teeth. IT took at least 30 min to get it out!! I had to mutlilate my guns till they BLED to DISLODGE it. I thought I was going to have to go to the dentist to have them fish this floss that was LODGED stuck between two teeth, I was in a panic, it really wouldn&#x27;t come out!! It&#x27;s basically a disaster compared to glide. I really don&#x27;t mid flossing but using this kind is a huge chore. Needless to say I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This floss is hard to find in stores.  I prefer this than the waxed ones.  This is gentle on my gums and leaves a little minty taste between my teeth.  My dentist always has these on hand when she gives out toothbrushes and floss packets.</li>
    <li> If I could give this item zero stars I would. This stuff has to be at least 50 years old because we have progressed passed the point of using simple twine or yarn as floss. Maybe it does have fluoride in it.  However, it clearly is not mint flavored, and it certainly isn&#x27;t from this decade!  Please save yourself!!! This floss will break and leave strings of twine between your teeth!!  No one wants that.</li>
    <li> Finally, a source for a floss that you cannot find any longer in drug stores. This is the ONLY stuff that works!</li>
    <li> Regular, thin, waxed dental floss really hurts my gums. This product is so gentle, now I love to floss! Well, sort of. And I bought a 6-pack for much less than the regular drugstore price so I have some everywhere in the house.</li>
    <li> This is the best--so hard to find in drug stores and more expensive--I stock up and hope it&#x27;s offered for a very long time.</li>
    <li> This floss works very well at grabbing stuff around my teeth.  It helps to make my teeth feel cleaner every time I use it.</li>
    <li> This is the best dental floss it removes everything. Now all you can find is that thin non braided stuff that just cuts your gums!</li>
    <li> My dentist found this floss and recommended it to me.  I ordered it from Amazon and now get my cleaning at the Dentist every eight months instead of every six months.  I like it.</li>
    <li> The best floss money can buy.</li>
    <li> The product smelled like it was old. I will never buy from this source again.</li>
    <li> This has been my go-to dental floss for years. It&#x27;s the only floss that really gets my teeth clean. Recently, there were availability problems and I had to use a different floss for a while. Well, it showed up on my next dental exam. I was asked \\&quot;have you been flossing?\\&quot; I&#x27;m religious about flossing every day and have been for years. It was the change of floss that made the difference. I&#x27;m happy to say that availability seems to be good again, and I&#x27;m back using my favorite floss.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why you have to go online to get this floss- it should be available in every drug store. It is recommended by dentists, does the best job of cleaning the spaces between teeth, and works very well if you have a bridge. No other floss even compares.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me I should be using this floss and amazon was the only place I could find it.  It is not the typical thin waked floss or tape.  It is kind of a soft braided rope style floss.  It really seems to scrub well between teeth.  My dentist has been happy with me so that is all that matters to me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been hard to find this gum care in stores lately. I&#x27;ve been looking for them longer them 2 months. Finally found them online and there is no difference from the ones you buy at the stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and will continue to do so. The only issue right now is the Amazon price. You would think when buying a package of 6 of these there would be some sort of cost savings, though I can go to local stores and get it the same day, no waiting for under 3 bucks a pack. The only convenience factor right now on these through Amazon is being able to sit in my armchair and have them delivered right to the house.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss made--by far!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best floss made--by far!!</li>
    <li> The floss is gentle and effective. I have tried other types and return to Gum Care floss every time. I do not like to run out of it and order several months supply at a time.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended woven floss as being superior and he was right. I can&#x27;t find it in the stores any,ore so Zi turned to Amazon. I ordered it and it came super fast, great price and superb product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Been using it for years.  For some weird reason, Johnson &amp; Johnson apparently doesn&#x27;t realize how good this product is because it&#x27;s hardly ever available in retail stores.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss I can use - everything else shreds between my very-tightly-packed teeth! Thank goodness I can find it here!</li>
    <li> Got this from a friend&#x27;s recommendation. It seems to work quite well, and my teeth indeed feel quite clean after flossing. The main problem I find is that it can easily shred and break when trying to floss between teeth that have a smaller gap. A few times so far, the floss broke between my teeth and got a small bit of twine tightly stuck between my teeth. This is a huge pain to get out, and sometimes I was afraid I did not get it all.</li>
    <li> Reach works very well and Amazon has it where local stores don&#x27;t.  Easy access is a plus for me. and is prescribed by my dentist.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for &#x27;Reach Deep Clean&#x27; floss.  Does not fray or break as easy as the &#x27;Deep Clean&#x27; floss did.  Great product from J&amp;J!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find fluoride treated floss in local stores. I floss daily.  This is excellent floss and added bonus of fluoride treatment, if you believe in fluoride..Some people don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s dental floss, so there isn&#x27;t much to say about it.  However, the order shipped promptly and arrived before expected.  Would order here again.</li>
    <li> I have very tight teeth, and the multiple strands in this floss spread better, making it much less likely to get caught between the teeth. Per my dental hygenist, the multiple strands does a much better job of cleaning. Great combination.</li>
    <li> As a registered dental hygienist I have observed  how well this floss performs.  A greater surface area makes it absorb and remove plaque. Advance it to get a soft clean peice so it can remove disease causing bacteris from between your tetth and below your gums.  Who doesn&#x27;t want a clean fresh-feeling in their mouth?  If your going to floss, get great benefits for your effort.&lt;br /&gt;It is vert hard to find these days so I appreciate the ease of ordering it here.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dentist as being the best floss. It is easy on your gums and yet more coverage than regular floss. Feels more like a rope massaging and cleaning your gums and between your teeth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to imagine how a company could mess up a product as simple as dental floss, but Johnson &amp; Johnson have done just this, by coating the floss with fluoride, which--if your fingers are the slightest bit wet--makes the floss too slippery to hold onto.  I&#x27;m never buying this floss again.</li>
    <li> This stuff if not slippery so it actually cleans between your teeth, has a nice minty flavor and the right strength. Works for me.</li>
    <li> I have found this woven dental floss to be the best product out there - and it is getting harder and harder to find.  I have great check ups at the dentist&#x27;s office and my gum disease is gone!</li>
    <li> I am diligent about teeth cleaning, and have used another brand for years. My daughter told me about this one, and my dental hygienist gave me a sample. My teeth have never felt so clean!</li>
    <li> Finally I found it again!  This floss is gentle, slides in easily and doesn&#x27;t break easily.  As a dental hygienist, I feel is cleans better than the slippery types that tend to glide over the plaque.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floss and is hard to find in the stores. It is a woven material instead of plastic.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss I can use that doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums. Periodontist recommended this to me after I had gum grafting surgery. Trust me, it&#x27;s way better than normal floss! The woven floss picks up plaque a lot better than generic, waxy brands. It feels soft, it works better, and the minty-ness of this floss is way better than one of the waxy ones. I definitely enjoy flossing a lot more now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, every time I buy these in bulk, my mom tries to steal them from me because she keeps forgetting you can buy these on amazon...haven&#x27;t really found them anywhere else....but they work really well, obviously, since everyone wants them. Once you go woven, you never go back! ;)</li>
    <li> This floss is very good and at the same time easy on my gums.  I was surprised at how quickly I received it.  I couldn&#x27;t find this floss locally and was very happy to find it on line.  I had samples from my dentist but they didn&#x27;t last until my next visits.</li>
    <li> I love woven floss, as it is easier on my gums and more flexible to use.  I also want non-waxed floss, so that it can really do its job.  Drug stores no longer seem to carry this floss, so I was really happy to find it at Amazon.  I never have to be without my standby floss again!</li>
    <li> This floss is hard to find in stores where I live.  Not sure if that is because it is not carried or is very popular.  My guess would be the second.  Thanks to Amazon for carrying this.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite floss.  He switched from using the ribbon type floss and his next dental cleaning showed a very noticeable improvement. We paid $19.97 for this 6 pack of 50 yard dispensers in Dec 2013. As of today (Jul 18 2014) the price of this item is $43.98! Why has the price of this item more than doubled?</li>
    <li> excellent product - gentle on the gums - as advertised</li>
    <li> Very good for wider spaced teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It is like a long tooth brush. Sometimes I put tooth paste on a length of the reach , in order to really clean between the teeth.</li>
    <li> This gum care floss is my fave: not too slippery and really feels like it is gently scrubbing teeth and gums. I&#x27;ve been frustrated in finding this exact product in stores, as none of the drug stores I shop at carry it. Now I have a fast, easy, and convenient vendor, and, sadly, there&#x27;s no excuse for not flossing everyday! The product is exactly what I expected, and the delivery was prompt. Even the packaging was appropriate. I am very happy w/ this order.</li>
    <li> my husband&#x27;s dentist recommended this floss. my husband and i race to floss every night - this is the BEST floss ever. the floss is easy on the teeth, smooth and yummy tasting. makes flossing something to look forward to. gentle on your teeth as well.</li>
    <li> I looked all over Los Angeles and Beverly Hills for the &amp;#34;braided&amp;#34; floss my dentist wants me to use and this was the closest I could find.  While most of us don&#x27;t like to floss-- often because it&#x27;s just so uncomfortable or even painful, Reach&#x27;s &amp;#34;Gentle Gum Care Woven Dental Floss&amp;#34; is as advertised --  gentle.  And because it&#x27;s not waxed it seems to pick up more food particles and plaque than the waxed ones which works well for me as I like to see some results from my efforts.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind a unflavored option however . . . if anyone from Johnson &amp; Johnson &amp;#34;a family company&amp;#34; is reading :-).  It did take a bit to get to me so if you need it ASAP spring for the expedited shipping.</li>
    <li> I became extremely frustrated, when every time (without fail) I would go to purchase this at Wal-Mart, and they were always completely out. This is the only floss I use, as it does the very best job of removing dental plaque.  It is made of dry woven threads coated in fluoride, no slippery wax what-so-ever.  Since plaque is slippery, I believe flossing with waxed floss is completely useless! I am at the place in life where I prefer not to run to the store for frequent repeat purchases (especially when they are always out of what I want!)  so buying in bulk suits me just fine.  I save time, money and gasoline! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice taste, soft, and thick! Works great! Dirt cheap for 300 yards of dental floss! Can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores in my area.</li>
    <li> Great product that I have trouble finding at the local chain pharmacy.</li>
    <li> It really works on my guns. It is however a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> This floss is the best texture for comfort and also for a really good clean feeling between your teeth. I&#x27;ve been looking for one since they stopped selling the Reach Deep Clean, and this is just as good.</li>
    <li> Great product for my dental needs.</li>
    <li> I like this floss best.  Fibers are impregnated with floride.  Fibers have a bit more traction on teeth to remove debris.</li>
    <li> Best Dental floss on the market if you want a deep clean.  Sometimes gets caught in the teeth, but worth it for the results you get as opposed to tape floss.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the store anymore, This is my favorite dental floss.  It doesn&#x27;t make my gums bleed and I feel like it gets my teeth really clean.  Occasionally I get a thread stuck in my teeth, but it is a small trade off.</li>
    <li> Woven, unwaxed floss increases the amount of plaque removed while flossing. Stretchable, flat flosses are easier to fit between teeth, but tend to remove a smaller percentage of the plaque. The product would have gleaned a fifth star had the floss not shredded when encountering tight inter-dental gaps.</li>
    <li> This product has been suggested to being the best dental floss available in 2013...REACH Dental Floss, 50 yard dispenser might not be traveler friendly, however it has a way of rewarding your teeth and/or gums...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite dental floss. I hate most of what is sold because so much of it is waxed, and the new, super slick types never feel as if they are removing anything from my teeth because they slide too easily. The mint flavor makes it pleasant to use, and the Fluoride adds some extra protection because since my local water tastes terrible, I only drink the bottled stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dental checkups for the past several years have been very good...\\&quot;Look Ma, no cavities\\&quot;, so I think I will stick with a good thing. BTW, this product keeps disappearing from local stores, so I&#x27;m very glad Amazon carries it. The thing I don&#x27;t understand is, if Amazon can get it, what exactly is Walmart&#x27;s problem?</li>
    <li> If you are tired of the waxy floss and &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; feeling it leaves on your teeth- try this woven floss with pastey fluoride built in. The weave of the floss really grabs onto stuff between your teeth and is still gentle on your gums... at least that I&#x27;ve notice with my own! Sure, its a little more than the waxy stuff, but its a difference you can feel.</li>
    <li> I feel that this kind of floss gets my teeth cleaner and those that slip through too easily, but it is hard to find in stores, so I am so thankful that I can get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> The loose weave seems to remove more &amp;#34;schmutz&amp;#34; from between my teeth than any other floss I&#x27;ve used in the past twenty years. It is gentle to my gums as well.</li>
    <li> For people who love unwaxed woven floss and can not find it in any local store, we have been saved!  Please patronize this company and buy this product.  I am so thankful that they are here to provide a product that we need, but is not stocked in any supermarket or drug store.  Spend your money with these people.</li>
    <li> Once I found this woven floss, I won&#x27;t buy any other.  It is the best for sensitive gums and it tastes good too.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find this particular product in the stores; I am very grateful that Amazo is carrying this floss! This woven floss is the best kind I have found for the gums and for keeping the teeth clear of plaque.</li>
    <li> This floss is very gentle on my gums, which are sensitive. I appreciate that it is easy to use and hope to be able to get it again.</li>
    <li> Have tried many types of dental floss. This is the best. Very gentle around gums. The threads are like a little blanket coated with minty fresh powder, unlike harsh waxed floss. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> But good luck finding it in the stores!  It works like a charm for those of us who have any implants - and makes your teeth and your implants feel squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> I like this woven kind.</li>
    <li> I have tried many store to find this product. This particular floss is great for my crown and bridge work and never shreds.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that Reach Gentle Gum Care woven floss is back on the market. It&#x27;s my favorite, so I ordered this pack of 6 and it got here in a few days. thank you.</li>
</ol>
