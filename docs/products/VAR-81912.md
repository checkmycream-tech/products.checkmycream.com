      <li>The liquid that goes on feels and looks like water at first, but it dries quicker.</li>
      <li>I do LOVE this stuff--if only for how it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of e.l.f. products but this eye refresh did not do much more than splashing water on your face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a makeup person, and usually more visual than that--but for the help this stuff gives me getting up in the morning</li>
      <li>Most of the effect is psychological.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>

      <li>Does absolutely nothing that it says it does.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice to much of a difference I stop using it after a while, I guess I&#x27;ll just stick to concealer</li>
      <li>I really just like the cooling effect</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guess the coldness from the metal roller ball is suppose to stop puffiness, eh like I said didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
      <li>The product is very convenient to carry in my pocket to when I may need it.</li>
      <li>Like you never drank the night before, haha.</li>

      <li>it does clear up some of the darkness.</li>
      <li>Cant really tell a difference yet, but I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times.  </li>
      <li>I put it on in the morning without any concealer...and let my skin be natural in that area.  </li>
      <li>So far, none of them worked.</li>
      <li>I felt like it had something like alcohol in it because it dried so quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This gel was so cool and refreshing on my under eye area! I don&#x27;t typically get bags under my eyes, but on a hot day it was still nice to use.</li>
    <li> I like to use this when it is only 5pm and I&#x27;m already getting tierd the stuff it gives off makes my eyes open.</li>
    <li> Provides cooling relief to the under-eye area at any point in the day.  I put it on in the morning without any concealer...and let my skin be natural in that area.  I dad a little tiny bit of concealer right AT the crease line and that is enough.  It is so soothing.  I love the convenience and the STYLE of the dispenser!</li>
    <li> Its pretty much cold water</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my eyes. Doesn&#x27;t even give you the slightest menthol effect. This is just purely applying cold water under your eyes.</li>
    <li> Does absolutely nothing that it says it does. Total waste of money. Would not recommend anyone to buy this ever.</li>
    <li> I keep this stainless steel canister in the freezer/ use it for one minute when you firt good up and the nights rest that caused eyes to sweet will be gone.  I want to use this for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> she likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  very very happy</li>
    <li> My under eyes feel so refreshed and good! Love this so much!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice to much of a difference I stop using it after a while, I guess I&#x27;ll just stick to concealer cause it gets the job done. I&#x27;m guess the coldness from the metal roller ball is suppose to stop puffiness, eh like I said didn&#x27;t really see a difference but for the price its not really a loss.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this. Cant really tell a difference yet, but I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times.  It does feel very cool and refreshing when you put it on. great seller, item ships fast- arrived a day before expected.</li>
    <li> I love this, not seeing a difference, but it feels nice going on around my eyes.  Feels soothing, which is what I want.</li>
    <li> I get bags from allergies in the morning from allergies. I&#x27;ve tried almost every de-puffer there is. So far, none of them worked. This one works a little if I keep using it throughout the day. By the end of the day, the bags are slightly reduced.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of e.l.f. products but this eye refresh did not do much more than splashing water on your face.</li>
    <li> Nice cooling and refreshing for eyeshades my tired eyes a pop of coolness&lt;br /&gt;I love the rolling effect like finger massage&lt;br /&gt;Just love this eye refresh</li>
    <li> After trying several over the counter remedies from fade creams, to skin renewal to cold creams with little to no noticeable results, I discovered this item on Amazon. e.l.f. Eye Refresh goes on easy and starts working almost immediately. After the third day of twice a day applications, I could tell the drastic clearing up of the dark shadows under my eyes. After a week, the puffiness all but disappeared. The product is very convenient to carry in my pocket to when I may need it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels on my eyes. It is truly refreshing and makes you feel more awake in the morning. I get bags/dark circles/puffiness under my eyes when I wake up, so I use this in the morning. I think it helps a little, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic improvement in those areas. It was worth the $2.38 I paid for it at my local TJ Maxx if only for the nice cooling sensation it gives you. Nice for waking you up in the morning and refreshing you during the afternoon.</li>
    <li> This is a relatively low cost product. Most of the effect is psychological. For the people who are expecting extreme results go get a concealer. I keep this in the refrigerator because I like the cooling sensation. I will purchase again from the E.L.F. Website.</li>
    <li> Love e.l.f products but was not impressed with this. It feels refreshing in the morning when you&#x27;re trying to wake up or on a hot day. Other than that it doesn&#x27;t do anything for puffiness or dark circles.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is refreshing.. Glides on very easily.</li>
    <li> Cools the under eye area a fair amount and feels refreshing, but hasn&#x27;t done anything to change the dark circles.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again</li>
    <li> I put it in the fridge for added cooling refreshment - another amazing product.</li>
    <li> MUST HAVE ITEM! Makes me feel so refreshed. The price is also amazing so why not try it out! Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this now. I use it every day, and several times a day to keep my eyes looking refreshed. The cooling sensation and the feel of the liquid just makes me feel a little bit more relaxed... It&#x27;s a true lifesaver.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye refresh liquid gel. It is cooling and refreshing when using on the eyelid and on the under-eye puffiness. It is of equal quality to the more expensive brand I had been using for quite a while. Good purchase!</li>
    <li> I like the refresh feeling it gives when you put it on in the morning. it does clear up some of the darkness. but I do not have dark circles that bad anyways. I really just like the cooling effect lol.</li>
    <li> Well, at least this wasn&#x27;t expensive. I felt like it had something like alcohol in it because it dried so quickly. There was nothing &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; about it and FOR SURE you couldn&#x27;t use it over make up. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Might as well smear a wedge a cucumber from the fridge under your eyes.....you get a 2 second cooling sensation and that&#x27;s it. If you wanna mask the puffiness or darkness under your eyes, do it AFTER make-up is done, with hilighter. Bit of high lighter on your brush under the eyes and Voila!...you look fresh. Like you never drank the night before, haha.</li>
    <li> I use this product when I wake up in the mornings and before bed. It definitely gives my puffy eyes a calming and less puffy look. It also brightens my dark circles. I apply a moisturizer under my eyes and then use the eye refresh. Goes great under makeup.</li>
    <li> I do LOVE this stuff--if only for how it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a morning person by any estimation, and need all the help in the world to get me out of bed in the morning. Enter Refresh. For people who love the shock of cool water on their face, this stuff is for you. For starters, it glides on with a metal ball, which in itself is enough to wake a person up. The liquid that goes on feels and looks like water at first, but it dries quicker. I feel silly remarking simply on how a product feels--I&#x27;m a makeup person, and usually more visual than that--but for the help this stuff gives me getting up in the morning, I have to give it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
    <li> Its a cool feeling and it comes out shiney and stays shiney until it wears off on any part of the body. Makes your eyes stick out more. The coolness will be good in the mornings.</li>
