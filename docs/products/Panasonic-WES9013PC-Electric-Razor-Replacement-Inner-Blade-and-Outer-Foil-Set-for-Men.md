<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just got these for my Panasonic ES8103S and I&#x27;m amazed. The razor feels like new, the shave is MUCH cleaner and with significantly less irritation around neck areas. It even sounds better now. Over the course of 2.5 years since I bought the shaver, with 2-3 times per week use, I didn&#x27;t realize how bad both the inner blades as well as the outer foil/blade have gotten. I never replaced foil/blades before since previous electric shavers (by cheap, non-Panasonic brands) died before I noticed degraded performance and simply got an entirely new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. No complaints</li>
    <li> It is fine. But doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp as original.</li>
    <li> Fits perfect.  Makes a dull shaver new again!</li>
    <li> The exact replacement foil and blade for an awesome shaver. Great price, too. Just wish I hadn&#x27;t waited this long to replace.</li>
    <li> ITEM DID NOT FIT MY PANASONIC SHAVER.  IT WAS APPARENTLY FOR ANOTHER MODEL AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK FOR MY SHAVER.</li>
    <li> Gradually, over time, my shaves got less and less close, requiring me to go over my face an increasing number of times.  But the change was so gradual, I was taking it in stride. I attributed it to my whiskers, which are always tough, getting tougher. But then I decided to order this replacement foil and blade set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I made the easily done blade and foil change.  I had not shaved for 2 days because I had been traveling. But with the new foil and blades, I got the closest shave I have gotten in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned.  When I notice that I must go over the face repeatedly to get a fairly satisfactory shave, I will make the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual says replace the foil yearly and the blades every 2 years.  That is much, much too long for me to wait. My whiskers require a new foil and blades in less than a year.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades are absolutely worth it - you may not notice that the razor doesn&#x27;t work quite as well over time because it changes so slowly, but replacing the blades occasionally makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> There is very little for me to describe as this is a replacement for what you already have and they work exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> These last me about a year and a half, maybe two years. I shave every day with the same electric razor, but I don&#x27;t have much to shave off. It always stinks to bite the bullet on replacing your blades, but I&#x27;ve trusted Panasonic for the past 10 years and they haven&#x27;t let me down yet.</li>
    <li> Brings shaver back to original shaving quality.  I&#x27;m now hoping the battery lasts awhile, as a new shaver would be about the same price as a battery replacement and the new shaving head.</li>
    <li> The product does what it&#x27;s suppose to. It costs too much in my opinion. You can almost buy a new one for those prices!</li>
    <li> Phew! As I opened them, the parts looked ever so slighly different than the ones I was replacing but they fit in the shaver and work well.</li>
    <li> Everything went very smooth, better than expected.  I was a first time user, but will be making other purchases in the future.</li>
    <li> My blades were about 3 years old and starting to grab. New blades shave much faster and smoother.  Since it shaves faster, I get more shaves per charge.</li>
    <li> Works well and lasts a reasonably long time. Better still, the Panasonic shaver itself has worked well for six years already ...</li>
    <li> The packaging for this replacement set says \\&quot;ES8109 and ES8101\\&quot; but not \\&quot;ES8103\\&quot;.  Regardless, it fits my [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ ES8103S]] just fine.  I used the original blade and foil for way too long.  Something like 2 years.  It still worked and everything seemed fine until I replaced the parts.  It works better now.  I guess those parts do wear out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d noticed the performance of my Panasonic ES8109S shaver starting to fall off - took longer, more strokes and nicks on my neck and chin so figured it was time to replace the foil and blades.    This pack is good value for money and immediately made a difference - the shaver was just as I remembered when I first bought it.     A good Amazon purchase.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have stated, replacing these components make it a new razor. I replaced the foil and blades about 6 months ago, and the razor is still performing like new. I too noticed a marked decrease in razor noise.    I&#x27;m now ordering more of these kits to keep in stock.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think Panasonic has any control on the quality of replacement parts made by third parties. I replaced both the foil and blades on my shaver one year after purchasing new razor from Amazon but the performance of the parts was complete disappointment. I expected the razor to perform &#x27;like new&#x27; but I felt that performance was actually worse than with worn parts. Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s great return policy, I am going to return these and put the olds one back on the razor. I would probably buy another new razor as I really like mine.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as they should. My second time replacing the blades in my razor.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I bought the replacement, my shaver is just like New &amp; I love this shaver!</li>
    <li> From time to time, ya gotta replace these.  It&#x27;s easy to do, and the shave is faster and smoother. I noticed, though, that the shaver tells me it needs to be cleaned almost all the time now - seems to be something not-quite-right about the new fit. No practical flaw, though.</li>
    <li> Lightening fast service and a great price</li>
    <li> This was excatly what I needed to get my Panasonic razor back up to snuff again.</li>
    <li> great just what I needed</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at the time I purchased the razor.  I like the fact that there are backup blades and foils available in case there is a need for replacements.  These items are made to go with the razor.</li>
    <li> what can I say-cuts like new!</li>
    <li> Fits my panasonic ES8101 perfectly.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference from the original parts.  This will enable me to get at least 1 more year of service out of this razor.</li>
    <li> New replacement blades saved my Panasonic electric shaver from the trash heap.  That is how close I was to trashing it.  My electric shaver now  performs like a brand new shaver.</li>
    <li> The replacement combo works like the original. Shaving is better now that I have replaced the worn out original. Don&#x27;t wait too long to replace the foil and blade.</li>
    <li> Makes a big difference on shave quality and speed.</li>
    <li> This item is on sale at Panasonic&#x27;s website for much more than is listed here. It&#x27;s the same foil, though, so save yourself some money and buy it here.</li>
    <li> wrong one picked due to fast clicking</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the foil and cutting blades on my 3 year old shaver. It now takes less passes to shave my face, over all much cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> Thought I would notice an improvement, however, I did not.  Would have liked to return but I threw out the old one once I put this in.  Next time, will not try to replace blade again, and will purchase a new shaver instead.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what the razor needed to make it cut well again.</li>
    <li> My ES8103 is like new again.</li>
    <li> I use the Panasonic ES8109S which I bought some years ago. It is the best electric shaver I have tried (and I tried several from Norelco, Braun, Remington and Wahl). I know there are newer models out there from Panasonic, but the ES8109S continues working nicely, so why get another one?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement foil is great and has allowed me to extend the life of my electric shaver. It comes with both the internal and the external foil, and installation can&#x27;t be simpler.</li>
    <li> I would buy this all over again. Big fan of wet-dry shavers because of skin and comfort. This shaver is better than any I&#x27;ve ever tried and my beloved original panasonoc wet-dry from like 12 years ago which recently gave up ghost. Closest electric shave i&#x27;ve ever had and most comfortable. But don&#x27;t buy it for the cleaning / charging stand. It&#x27;s a piece of junk. Buy it for the shaver.</li>
    <li> A great item...I have been using this product for years and the blades last a long time...i shave my pate and head hair can wear out blades quickly...these do not wear out.</li>
    <li> Replacing these parts make the shaver run like new. I&#x27;ll be replacing these parts on a regular schedule from now on.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement foil and blade set for a panasonic shaver. My model is an ES8807, however it works with many Panasonic models. I suggest going to Panasoincs shaver page to see if this applicable for your model. You can&#x27;t only go by the models listed on the front of the package. This replacement set will make your Panasonic shaver work like new again! In my case I had let my shaver go so long that it even sounds quieter now. The shaver does a fine job on my beard again. Panasonic recommends replacing the foil every yaer and the blades every two years. I had probably let both of mine go for 3 years, I had checked and I actually had holes in my foil (I had cut myself a couple times and that made me look at the parts). If you need to replace these parts you&#x27;ll be amazed at how well the shaver works again. This was the best price I could find anywhere for this combo set. A very good deal.</li>
    <li> I had waited a couple of years before replacing the foil and blade.  I had gotten used to the my shaver&#x27;s performance I guess.  I had forgotten what a great job it did.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly, and performed as well as the original blades and foil.I gave it four stars because I will wait and see how long this set lasts. The original set lasted almost three years.</li>
    <li> Great! came fast, fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> My shaver now shaves like new.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Panasonic Foil and Blades as they are are a great product.The price was great and the product was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Clearly I need to get this package a bit more frequently.  I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s been close to 2 years that I&#x27;ve had my ES8103 and hadn&#x27;t changed the blades. The replacement took about 30 seconds total and it makes a world of difference in the shave - closer/cleaner/faster.  I was just going to get the blades, but figured why not get the foil as well for the additional $10?  I&#x27;ll probably purchase another set to have a spare around for when it&#x27;s time for the next change.</li>
    <li> These blades did not give my husband a clean shave.  The original blades that came with the shaver were great!  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Always READ reviews BEFORE you buy.  Contrary to description the foil portion of the set does not fit on the ES 8077 model.  I nearly broke it trying to take 1 foild from the new one and putting it into the old one. I finally did it and it does work but not like it should (I may have bent it somehow). On the plus side, my trimmer works again now (It had stopped working for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace the foil for hubby&#x27;s shaver. Product is exactly as described, arrived on time, and works great - and an easy way to extend the life of the shaver.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping time. Item exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Very simple, they recommend that you replace the shaver head once a year. I waited two years and the blade was getting dull and the foil actually chipped. I found this replacement head and it was the best deal I could find. Made the shaver work like new again.</li>
    <li> The replacement combo shaver foil and blade set arrived on time. It was easy to install both the blade and foil.  Note the foil only fits in one direction.  I charged the unit and it works like new on my one year old Panasonic Shaver.    Great product and vendor.[[ASIN:B001J6O0JG Panasonic WES9013PC Combo Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set]]</li>
    <li> These parts are exactly what I needed for my Panasonic wet/dry razor.  The price I paid for the combination items was much better than what was offered by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Great replacement razor blades. They last me a year but, I do not have a heavy beard so your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace original head. Works like new now.</li>
    <li> The razor has worked very well; I&#x27;ve always considered the replacements too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
    <li> Same product as you would get in a store except cheaper. I have used an electric shaver for years and I love them. This one works great wet or dry and the replacement blades are a perfect fit. They are sharp right out of the package and there are no defects.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly as a replacement for my dented cover piece (a dog bit into my previous one).</li>
    <li> The item works wonderfully and if I need anymore razor products then I will definitely go through them!</li>
    <li> I really like the way this product works. I am having trouble figuring out how to keep it from smelling!</li>
    <li> I follow the recommendations of Panasonic and replace the screen every year and the cutting blade every two years. I was able to notice a significant improvement in the closeness of a shave after this year&#x27;s replacement of screen and blade. Installation of the blade and screen was very easy.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001J6O0JG Panasonic WES9013PC Combo Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set]]    Contrary to vendor claim and as specifically reviewed by S FROHMAN in the first customer review for the product....the foil portion of the set does not fit on the ES 8077 model.  The base of the foil replacement has two small tabs on the sides of the base.  The base of the foil is too small for the two tabs to fit in the slots on either side of the razor housing.  I chose this item specifically to replace both elements of the razor...and verified by the reviewer!!  Bummmer.  The really bad news is there are no parts available at retailers where you can see the real product and fit check it.  Looks like my first mistake was buying Panasonic...them using on line acquisition.  Bummer squared.</li>
    <li> I love my Panasonic shaver, but they say you are supposed to replace foils and blades I believe every 6 and 12 months (respectively).  I felt like I was fine with the ones I had but I went with it.  I couldn&#x27;t notice a difference for the first shave or two, but after that it does really feel different.  Also, I can shave in fewer passes.  I wanted the Panasonic brand name so I paid a little more, but I think it was worth it.</li>
    <li> outer foil is wrong size for the razor listed as compatible.</li>
    <li> Good product, works well, good price.</li>
    <li> This product was super easy to replace with the original. The replacement blades simply pop on to the razor after you just gently pull off the old set.</li>
    <li> My husband damaged the foils on his Panasonic wet dry shaver, so this is the replacement.  It works fine and it fits fine too.&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived in a timely manner and will order this product again if and when necessary.</li>
    <li> Order was received as promised. Replacement blades and screens work fairly well but do not cut as close as I would like. I will probably go back to Braun for my next electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat a tune-up!  This is the stuff you&#x27;ll need and believe me you will notice an immediate difference.  As always, Amazon shipped pronto.  Love my Amazon Prime Membership.  It&#x27;s good for other things besides videos, etc..(like shipping)</li>
    <li> It may be a fine product, probably is, but it&#x27;s not properly listed. Open the zoom picture and look closely with your razor in hand to see if it will fit. The models listed are NOT all compatible.</li>
    <li> Although the item came without installation instructions, it became clear to me that you really didn&#x27;t need them. Noticed the difference in my shaver right after I installed the new blades and foil.</li>
    <li> I had my panasonic shaver for about 1 1/2 years and I noticed that it was starting to pull my hair a little bit. I was thinking about buying a new shaver, but then ran across these replacement blades. Once I received them, they were very very easy to install. I started the shaver up and now it cuts just like it did 1 1/2 years ago. For the price I think they are a great deal and the panasonic nano line of shavers are just amazing.</li>
    <li> exactly as described. it&#x27;s a replacement foil, so it didn&#x27;t change my life or make me lose weight, but it does work.</li>
    <li> Easy to install. Now back to almost new.</li>
    <li> Went two years on my old blades and foil. You are suppose to change the foil every year but I am cheap. After installing the new blades and foil I have a new razor again. Works good and the shave is back to one where I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area time and time again to get good results.</li>
    <li> When people criticize electric shavers, its mainly because they don&#x27;t realize that the blades dull and need to be replaced the same as any other razor.  I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic ES8103 Wet/Dry model for years now and as long as I swap out the blades as needed it easily gives a great, even shave in less time than a standard bic without the occasional nick or irritation.  The ability to use light forms of shaving cream in the shower really makes things nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the markup on these things is ridiculous.  If it weren&#x27;t for the discounted pricing offered through Amazon, I would probably just buy an entirely new razor as the replacements don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the originals did.  I know in the future, I will be taking replacement costs into consideration when buying my next razor.  Come on Panasonic, I can&#x27;t see this whole package costing them less than a dollar to make.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic razor head is functional.  I never really feel like I&#x27;m getting a \\&quot;new\\&quot; product, tho.  It just seems to work a little bit better than the one I replace (... except in this case I replaced a broken head, so it works MUCH better!)</li>
    <li> I had never owned a Panasonic electric razor before but after reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to buy the razor that uses these blades.  I really like the razor so when it came time to replace the blades I decided to stick with the razor and replace them rather than looking for another brand of razor.  Panasonic has a great lineup.</li>
    <li> The package for this item is cut open, i dont know why but its supposed to be sealed. Its possible that this is a returned item. Im very dissapointed!!</li>
    <li> Made the shaver like new!  Have had this shaver for 1 1/2 years and it just was&#x27;t doing the job any more.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I received the blade and the screen broke within 2 weeks. my previous screen lasted 20 months. I requested a replacement within the warranty period, but I have not received it. I am disappointed,  and wasted 26 dollars.</li>
    <li> Should have replaced the Razors a LONG time ago.. Made my Electric shaver feel like new.</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic for years and the quality continues to be on par.</li>
    <li> New life for a razor.  It was easy to order through amazon, replace and now use.  Feels like I have a brand new electric razor. I also did not have to go through studies to find the best new razor to get.    At first I was not sure this would work with th razor model I found, but it did.    Product Features  Fits shaver models ES8103S, ES8109S  Also es8109.  The \\&quot;s\\&quot; was added subsequently to the latest model.</li>
    <li> Like many I waited too long to swap out the blades and screen!  -Fits the ES8103 though perhaps sits just a hair (pun intended) lower. I don&#x27;t use the sides to shave anyway.  -These blades are STAINLESS STEEL, I think the originals are Nanotech or something to that effect.  -BOTTOM LINE: Returned the shaver back to original performance. Must have!</li>
    <li> I love this model shaver and want to keep it running like new. This combo pack is cheaper than buying the foil and blades individually.</li>
    <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t order more at the time I ordered this one since I had a challenge finding the item before coming to Amazon.</li>
    <li> Hard to review something like this as it either works or doesn&#x27;t, and in that case did you order the correct one? My hope is that these last a long time with proper care!</li>
    <li> Was thinking about getting a new razor after a couple of years of use. Even after replacing the blades I was struggling to get a close shave. Talked myself into getting the combo foil/blades and what a difference a new foil makes. I had no idea that it was such an important aspect of getting a close shave. Do yourself a favor and replace the foil and blades at least once a year.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but horrendously expensive for what it is.  Panasonic is following the old adage of giving away the razor, then make money by selling the blades.</li>
    <li> Good Product, Good Price, Good Service</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34; feeling others have mentioned but this shaver is head and sholders beyond the Braun I have.</li>
    <li> I had gone without changing my foil and blades for about 3 years now. My razor feels brand new again, it&#x27;s a night and day difference. Shaving feels so smooth again without catching on longer hairs. Docking one star as it is quite pricy at almost 1/2 of the cost of an entire new shaver (i have the es8103 which is often on sale around $70)</li>
    <li> Excellet... My shaver is working like new again, sharp, smooth and no snags. Try this before buying a new shaver.</li>
    <li> My shaver is about 18 months old but the motor works perfecty , not so the foil and the blade.With this set the shaver works like new.</li>
    <li> Works well. Great shaver.</li>
    <li> Good replacement part for an EXCELLENT razor.</li>
    <li> Really who has time and money to shave with a blades/cream anymore?  Been using electric shavers for years, replace about once a year for new feel. This is my favorite and a great razor for not so heavy beards.  Does not abuse skin like Brauns or Norelco (gasp) -rotary shavers are just are bad on my neck.  Stay clean!</li>
    <li> My old sets were starting to leave a black film on wherever I shaved after 6 month. I think it&#x27;s the grease from my face. Either way, with correct cleaning and the included hard shell these can stay sharp and dent free for at the very least the 6 month I have my subscription set for.</li>
    <li> This to replace the ones I had in my razor. They fit perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Razor worded just like it did when new.</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly and if you don&#x27;t regularly replace your blades this will make your razor literally &#x27;like new&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the electric razor 2 yrs now.  Wonderful product for shaving especially if you&#x27;re a bald guy.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Purchased at the same time as the razor just in case they go out of production. Like the razor very much,</li>
    <li> These Replacement blades and foil are just O.K. and nothing to brag about.  The combo pack is not much better than the set I discarded when these arrived except the old set did not create facial burning as these do.  The whisker length, however, is much finer than the previous original set so I will conclude that the blades are cutting at a slower rate but as effectively as the original with the exception of the burning and that is probably caused by the pressure I am putting on the razor&#x27;s head in an effort to get smooth shaving.  Each of the new blades appear to be sharper and the foil is close to the same density as the original.  As I said, the replacement set is just average and is good enough for me to continue using the Panasonic because it is a surburb razor.</li>
    <li> Met all my expatations. The razor works best when using Williams Lecteic Shave. Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. This is the 2nd head I have bought. They last about a year. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The razor I have is an older model Panasonic ES8109 that I picked up while at Fort Benning for shaving during field exercises.  That was approximately 30 months ago.  It was time to replace the foil/blades.  Suddenly it was like I was shaving with a new razor.  Top notch product.</li>
    <li> Original replacement foil &amp; blade set. Works great. Amazon pricing was the best I found and made it easy to order. Came packaged well.</li>
    <li> Just like getting a new razor if the rest of your razor works well.  So you&#x27;re saving some bucks buying it.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic replacement blade combo kit was a perfect fit and made my 4 year old razor like new again.  Make sure you match the combo kit to the model number of your razor.  Easy to change in less than 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> Son dropped his razor and needed replacement heads. Fit was correct and price was very good. Quick turn a round on the order also.</li>
    <li> They look just like the original foils that came with my shaver, but this set started rusting in about 2 months, and I would say I&#x27;m a light user. I use them, clean them, and dry them the same way I did the last set. They just seem to be more prone to rusting. The blade part seems fine, just the foils are rusting.</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly, as they should.  The razor worked much better with the new blades, I will purchase another set.</li>
    <li> I love this Panasonic electric shaver, and the new blade &amp; shield makes the shaver work like new again - reasonably close shave without cuts or pain.  I think Panasonic price gouges on these replacement parts, but since old dull blades defeat the essential purpose of the shaver, you&#x27;re stuck.  PS, yes, an old fashioned manual blade gives a closer shave than this electric shaver, but with new blade &amp; shield, this shaver comes close to matching the performance of the old fashioned manual blade razor.  I get about 1 year of use from the replacement blade/shield - but you can get longer than a year of use if you are willing to accept the degraded performance that comes with a dull blade.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this. Super easy to install. Takes about 10 seconds. I get about one year per replacement. I&#x27;ll be buying this item again.</li>
    <li> A real necessity to keep your razor in prime working order.</li>
    <li> I see lots of other good ratings, but I must say this purchase was worth every penny.  I don&#x27;t care about giving large corporations any free advertisement, but whoever created this shaver and blades should get their due.  This replacement is better than the original, which is really saying something, as those were real good.  These blades/foil are much quieter than even my last set.  AND, they work faster than any previous blades; by double.  I don&#x27;t usually rave, but these really are great.</li>
    <li> Does just what you want it to do, shaves great.  Doesn&#x27;t hold the edge very long however.  You could buy these every month if you wanted to keep the like new feeling.</li>
    <li> like it for the money.  not sure it will last as long as the original. it lasted two years before this replacement. i don&#x27;t think the new replacement shaves quite as close as the original.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever bought. I&#x27;ve had my shaver for years! It has followed me from coast to coast, to Iraq, and to Afghanistan: and I still have the same one. All I have to do I change the blades...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller provided the product as described and promptly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Buying a new Combo Replacement is like getting a new Shaver. For me, its worth the money especially when I get it at Amazon.com price. What there not to like?</li>
    <li> Bought this a few months back. Price was competitive and my shaver works like it did when I bought it. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive for just blades and a screen but it is what it is.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly. Shaves almost as good as new, but I don&#x27;t really remember what new felt like since it has been 2 years.</li>
    <li> So I went over a year using the same blade and foil on my Panasonic electric shaver and suddenly decided to change them... man what a difference!  Not only does it cut closer again, but it&#x27;s less noisy, I guess with time you get used to the slow degradation of the shaver and don&#x27;t think about replacing these essential moving parts. I&#x27;m planning on replacing them every 6 months from now on.</li>
    <li> Perfectly fitted as described</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine on my 8103 which I had for over 1.5 years.  When I first installed it, the sound was much quieter which made me wonder if it was working.  Sure enough, I got a close shave.  I guess my old one got so loud perhaps that will be a sign to me that it is not working next time.</li>
    <li> After about 3 years I replaced this set and the shaver is working as new again. Shaving those difficult to reach hairs is much easier again. Even 2 or 3 day beard is quickly shaved.</li>
    <li> This works well. I had waited too long to replace the old blade, so it was very nice to see how much shaving was with this replacement.</li>
    <li> Fit&#x27;s great. Seems to cut very well. Great price and installed very easy.  I will order again when replacement is needed.</li>
    <li> The WES9013PC Combo Replacement Foil and Blade Set made my ES8103 Panasonic shaver new again.  Everything fit the same as the original set.</li>
    <li> It did improve shaver performance by quite a bit if not dramatically.  Price was OK, about 1/3 of that of a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Purchase blade and screen, both work very well and the shaver acts as a new one and items arrived before acutall date.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  Easy to install.  Ridculous price for an item that probably cost pennies to manufacture.</li>
    <li> As always, Panasonic shaver products are excellent. No problems, instant replacement.</li>
    <li> Like ink-jet cartridges, electric razor blades are overpriced.  These things don&#x27;t stay sharp that long, either; I get about 4 months out of a set, and they give a better shave in the first month.</li>
    <li> The unit you suggested is VERY BAD, and WRONG!  I gave indicated that the WES 9013PC, but that is wrong!  I have finally learned that understood (or that YOU should known!) that the required unit is WES 9079P. . .  for the WES 9077P, very big problem for BOTH parts required!!!</li>
    <li> Simple to attach.....seems to make a better shave.....$30.00....,a little pricey</li>
    <li> Good fit, good price, it works.</li>
    <li> These blades are great.  We have them on auto recorder and get them every couple months.  Some folks may not need them that often.</li>
    <li> It replaces my prior lower model Panasonic that did a great job for many years. It&#x27;s better and so it&#x27;s somewhat quicker.</li>
    <li> My razor shaves like it did when it was brand new.  Don&#x27;t wait like I did.  Replace that old one and make shaving more pleasant again.  I&#x27;m going to make it last longer.  I&#x27;ll shave maybe every other day or maybe three days.  I&#x27;m 74, retired and don&#x27;t care if I&#x27;ve got a little stubble.</li>
    <li> You need this for the razor to perform at its best</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement head for my Panasonic razor and found this to be really very, very good.  It meets all of my expectations.</li>
    <li> These work great in the Panasonic shaver we now stow in our luggage for our many trips to the California coast.</li>
    <li> Price was very good. To my dismay, the quality of the cutters did not last. My good shaves did not last long. They say to replace this set every year. I have to replace them every 3 months. Not the quality I expected.</li>
    <li> I get a poor shave with these blades.  Will uses for a few months and purchase a different brand of electric razor.</li>
    <li> I put the shaver serial number in the search box and this item came up as a replacement, but it doesn&#x27;t fit the shaver, so it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> Did not fit model as advertised.</li>
    <li> Does the job, sharp just like the day I bought it</li>
    <li> Shaver works like new old one just would not cut after two years. Now its like it was when new.</li>
    <li> This is the best replacement blades for the Panasonic Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;They work as they meant for this shaver.  I buy a new set&lt;br /&gt;each year.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t replaced the original blades on my shaver in about four years. Enter these babies, and BAM! Smooth, close shaving again!</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I ordered and arrived promptly. I&#x27;ve not yet used the product but it is a comfort knowing I&#x27;ve replacement blades and foil at the ready.</li>
    <li> Changing the screen and blade took my 1 year+ old razor and made it like new! They say to replace them every six months, I probably should have based on how much closer my shave is now.</li>
    <li> The replacement set works well, it was easy to install. The blades are sharp and easily cleaned.  I like this razor very much; it gives a good shave, dry or wet.</li>
    <li> This shaver and replacement foil and blades have been the best electric shaver and parts I have ever used. I shave my bald head and face daily. Lots of work. This sharp shaver does the job, no cuts or bumps. Nice smooth head and face. HOWEVER. You must clean, rotate the blades once a month or so, then replace the blades once a year for optimum results. No too much to ask if you want a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have had this shaver for years and replaced the blades once a year. Very simple .[[ASIN:B003H9HPAO New - Panasonic Mens Shaver - Es8109S]]</li>
    <li> All components plugged right in.  Nice shaves!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend replacing the the parts in your Panasonic shaver on a regular basis. It really helps with the efficiency of the razor and gives you a much closer shave.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Bought it to replace my worn out blades and foil - easy to install, delivered on time, and item was new as described.</li>
    <li> I bought a Panasonic shaver to replace my old Braun after finding the Braun replacement cutterheads have about 1/2 the number of cutters as the originals.  Half the cutters &#x3D; wears out twice as fast!  The Panasonic shaver gave me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric razor, and the foil and cutterhead lasted me about a year and a half.  The replacement foil and cutterhead fit like new, looked identical to the originals, and cut just as good.  No regrets about buying the Panasonic razor or these replacement parts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a replacement blade and foil set.  I love my Panasonic razor.  It works better than any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had and after a couple of years, I dropped the razor and the foil had a hole in it.  It was only a few dollars more for the foil and razor than just the foil so I purchased the kit.  It brought the razor back to like new and the price was better than anywhere I could purchase it locally.</li>
    <li> With these new blades and shaver foil in only two months it is already a struggle again to get a smooth shave without rubbing my face raw. I use it in the shower with Gillette shaving cream, with soap, and with only water with similar difficulties. i have also tried it dry, and with both Mennen and Williams pre-electric shave. I am now ready to invest a bunch of money in yet another shaver, with hopefully better results- not a Panasonic, of course. If these new blades lasted 6 months I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much, but this is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This replacement fit perfectly for my Panasonic ES8103 shaver.  I noticed a significant improvement in shave quality.  I am totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as the original blades - disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product give a smooth but not close shave. That is the responsibility of the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;None of this limitation has anything to do with Amazon&#x27;s service which is excellent.</li>
    <li> I RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY ONE LOOKING FOR A CLOSE SHAVE AND ANYONE WHO USES ELECTRIC REPLACEMENT INNER BLADES</li>
    <li> The product itself is great.  It makes my razor seem like new again since I can shave faster than before with more dull blades.  My only problem is that the price has gone up almost $10 since the last time I purchased it (two years ago).</li>
    <li> My shaver&#x27;s blades had gotten dull.  Shaves were  not as close as before and it was taking three times as long to get it done.  When I installed the replacement blades that all went away. shaves are close and smoothe and quickly accomplished.  Good fit. Good function.</li>
    <li> Only issue is the cost. The product is excellent, but at about half the cost of the razor itself, it becomes a question of cost effectiveness of keeping the razor.</li>
    <li> as expected, razor works like new again</li>
    <li> Electric razor user should be familiar with the sensation of the cutting block going dull. I&#x27;ve gone through several replacements of these (about once a year), and the performance improvement is immediately noticeable. Can&#x27;t complain about the Panasonic product at all. Price seems reasonable and the durability and performance of their blades has never left me concerned.</li>
    <li> Based upon a prior order, you sent me a reminder of purchasing the foil and blades for the panasonic shaver.  I ordered from your reference.  The blades were fine but the foil screen was for a different model and did not fit my shaver model.</li>
    <li> No issues at all - works great!  Went back and forth on replacing my razor, but glad I kept it and just replaced the blades. They cut smooth and the razor is still running strong.</li>
    <li> this foil .blades are just what was needed for my shaver.</li>
    <li> This is not the correct item.  The model # for my electric shaver is ES8243, so I have to return it.</li>
    <li> Original OEM part. Thanks,</li>
    <li> So far months later its lasting as long as the original. No worries when ordering this part at all from this supplier.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this I read through the other customer reviews. Some said that it was worthless because it didn&#x27;t fit their razor, but they didn&#x27;t say what razor they had, so I could not make a determination if I would have that problem too. The package said that it fit my razor - the model ES8103 Wet/Dry razor. So, I bought this replacement pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my ES8103 razor for several years and never replaced the foil or cutting blades. Recently, the foil developed a small hole in one spot and it was getting bigger. It was digging my face in some sensitive areas, so the shave was not very good any more. That is why I decided to replace both the foil and the cutting blades. The foil is available on Amazon for around $22 and this pack that included the foil and blades was only $28 so for a few dollars more, I got the blades too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came this morning via Fedex and I immediately took the blister pack apart - Please manufacturers - these blister packs are terrible to get open. You need a really good pair of scissors and you can cut yourself on the plastic. I hate blister packs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this set fit my razor perfectly. I gave myself a shave and it there was so much different from my old foil/cutters that I thought I had a new razor. I don&#x27;t know if it was the new foil or the blades, but the combination made my razor work like new. Great shave without gouging my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for my Panasonic ES8103 razor - this replacement pack fit and works perfectly. It gets 5-stars from me.</li>
    <li> This product is really just as I expected....I&#x27;m getting &#x27;close-shaves&#x27; again!</li>
    <li> Husband hasn&#x27;t used replacements yet as the shaver is still working great. Nice to know we have them when he finally does need to switch out.</li>
    <li> Appears to be the exact replacement for my Panasonic Shaver.  This is the second set I have purchased.  Using these replacements restores shaver to brand new like performance.</li>
    <li> Exactly the part my husband needed to make his razor like new. Amazon makes it easy to get needed parts.</li>
    <li> Why I didn&#x27;t replace my blades sooner I&#x27;ll never know! Work great, last long-time. If you figure the cost of traditional razors vs. these replacement blades, it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
    <li> The original metal screen on my ES8103S had small holes all of a sudden and the blades started cutting my skin little here and there.&lt;br /&gt;I think the blade itself was fine but since they don&#x27;t sell just the metal screen, I bought this whole set and replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been working great and no holes on the screen yet.</li>
    <li> Replaces the foil and blade from my 2 year old shaver perfectly. A good choice to renew an old standby for another few years.</li>
    <li> Bought this to extend the life of my electric razor.  Unfortunately, and admittedly subjectively, it seems not to work as well as the original. It leaves my skin feeling bumpy and torn.</li>
    <li> It took less than 15 seconds to replace the foil and blades for my ES8103.  I used to take my razor to the razor repair place, believing that it was a dangerous and delicate process.  That store moved across town, so I thought that I would bravely take the DIY route.  To my relief, the process is as simple as squeezing the sides of the foil to pop it out and pulling the blades straight off.  The instructions don&#x27;t show how to replace them, but you just stick the foil back in and it snaps in place.  You push the blades straight down and they snap in place (by holding the sides to avoid cutting yourself on the blades themselves).  All 15 seconds.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using Panasonic wet/dry shaver for a while now, just give your skin some time to her used to it and you will get excellent result!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality replacement shaving head. Turned razor to like new condition. Just ordered another</li>
    <li> Worked great.  Shaver is cutting like new.</li>
    <li> Original Panasonic part. Excellent.</li>
    <li> I was told it would work with my shaver, but it doesn&#x27;t. Either the wrong item was sent or&lt;br /&gt;the replacement foil is for a different Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. Razor works like new.</li>
    <li> It had been about a year since I replaced blades. I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old blades were until I used the new blades and foil top.  The new blades provide a closer shave in less time with less irritation.</li>
    <li> Old razor shaves like a new one!</li>
    <li> Makes all the difference, really makes it a new razor.  I&#x27;ve been using the older ES 8109 and now the newer ES 8103 (yeah the lower number is newer) for many years and replace the blades between nine months and a year.  Cleaning is with dish soap, then I dry and give it a quick shot of Remington Shaver Saver (Amazon) which has lube in it.</li>
    <li> Used these for over a year and they were still super sharp. I shave every day, never dulled on me! I replaced them just for the simple fact that it&#x27;s been a year. New ones cut the same as the year old ones!</li>
    <li> Item was good value for money and the post was quite quick as well.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and came quick</li>
    <li> The foil and cutters fit my shaver and were just what I needed to improve my shaver&#x27;s performance. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Outstanding replacement blades for my Panasonic razor, exact size and shape which fit without any issue...blade appears just like the original blades that came with the razor...highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Used an electric razor for the past 40+ years--Remington, Braun, Schick, now Panasonic. Have always thought these replacement foils and blades were overpriced. These are the cheapest I could find, but they shave comfortably and after about 8 months of use still perform their job well.</li>
    <li> Takes 2 seconds. Will make your razor good as a new one. Mine was damaged in travel and I bought these and presto! Back to normal.</li>
    <li> this razor is the best i have had.the motor in it sounds like an Indy race car compared to other razors I&#x27;ve owned.lots of pep</li>
    <li> Have used Panasonic razors for many years.  When they&#x27;re new, no other razor performs as well, in my opinion.  But with age the blades do dull gradually.  Because the change is slow, it is difficult to know when to replace them.  My advice is to not wait.  Better too soon than too late.  I just changed (more than 2 years) the blade and head with this kit and the improvement in performance and comfort was very, very noticeable.  Makes me think that I waited too long and that an annual replacement will be well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Good description of product.  Lets me know I&#x27;m buying right product.  Quick and easy ordering.  Fast receipt of product.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised and exactly as stated.  Thanks for the excellent service.</li>
    <li> These are a must.  Great price.</li>
    <li> This is the best way to go for the replacement attachments for the   Panasonic ES8109s dry and wet shaver. I have found that this product  works better with a wet shave versus dry. An individual purchase  of a foil and blade is costly. It&#x27;s recommended that the outer  foil be replaced every year and inner every two. As far as the  ES8109s shaver goes it works quite well with lather, although extra  triming is required on neck and chin for me. But I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> works as advertised....after 10 months it was time for a replacement</li>
    <li> Have been using this replacement kit for a long time. always change the foil and blades so the wear together. Amazon is the only place to buy them, since they cost almost half of a new razor, but then, they are half of the razor, worthless without sharp cutters.</li>
    <li> This is the exact replacement for my Panasonic razor.  The price of this replacement is almost $10 cheaper than what I could find at Target.  Having it delivered to the door is icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> Delivered before anticipated date!! Great work!</li>
    <li> I was prepared to replace my old Panasonic shaver, because the machine was not cutting as close as it should and it took many passes to get a clean shave.  A new shaver was about $100 .  I noticed that I could replace just the cutting portion of the shaver for about $30, so I purchased a set and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;This make a huge difference in the shaver and actually restores it to new condition.  This is a wet or dry shaver with sealed parts, so there is nothing to service but the heads. I recommend replacing both the foil screen and the cutting blade as a set.</li>
    <li> The price is Great and the replacement foil and blade are genuine Panasonic parts. The shipping time was pretty reasonable too.</li>
    <li> They are brand new and fit and work just like the ones that came on the shaver when I bought it.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  It is better than the foil and blade that came with the shaver.  With the original foil and blade I only got 9 shaves per charge and with this foil and blade I get 10 to 11 shaves per charge.</li>
    <li> Some extra info to make this excellent razors blades last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower most of the time and use glycerin bar soap. I am retired so don&#x27;t shave every day which would extend life of the blades and foil obviously. Afters shaving I spray the blades and foil clean, shake water out, blot the blades on a towel and then use the high speed mode to remove any remaining water. Wet blades slowly oxidize the edges, same for a regular razor shortening it&#x27;s life. The original blades and foil have lasted over five years, with no holes in the foil since purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The new blades and foil kit made the Panasonic razor like new again giving close shaves. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Although item wasn&#x27;t received with original shipment, Amazon acted very quickly to rectify the problem.  The first use with the new set told me I had waited way too long to replace the original foil and blade set.</li>
    <li> I love this Lip Glaze set! They always have a great set, but this one in particular is even better this year (if that&#x27;s even possible!) Besides the colors being great, the packaging is perfect. I usually like to keep some for myself then give others as part of gifts, and this year they&#x27;re already pre-packaged into 3&#x27;s within the package - great to mix and match!!!! LOVE IT! Especially with the little tags around each trio with labeled &amp;#34;to:&amp;#34; &amp;#34;From:&amp;#34;. This is great, stila has done it once again :)</li>
    <li> I have two of these waterproof shavers, and they just keep on a ticking. The foil and blade are factory ones, so get these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have to get the shaver first.</li>
    <li> Amazon shipped free and the two replacement sets arrived on the expected day.  The two razors I have are like new - I got about a year and a half out of the original blades but the new ones made quite a difference!  And I save some money - the razors were still working great so there was no need to spend more to buy new ones!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s like having a new razor</li>
    <li> Bought it because reviews were good.  But not as good as my old rotary Norelco that died after over 10 years of use (battery would no longer charge).  Takes three times longer to to shave and have to go over same area many more times than with my old rotary.  Next time, it&#x27;s back to rotary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for quite a while and when replacing the blades it works as new.</li>
    <li> Brought my razor back to life, good as new!</li>
    <li> Working fine.  Seems to be a perfect drop in replacement.  Much smoother shave now.</li>
    <li> The foil assembly is very light and small, not nearly as sturdy and substantial as the original that came with the shaver. It works reasonably well but I like the original better. The blades seem to be fairly similar to the original.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Panasonic ES8109 Shaver in March 2011. 4 years later it was time to replace the blades and the foil. I ordered the&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic WES9013PC Electric Razor Replacement Kit and when it came it was super easy to install. I shaved to see what the new blades and foil were like and WOW, I had forgotten what a REALLY Close shave was! I am So Impressed that I will probably order another Replacement Kit on payday, so in 4 more years I will be ready.&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY Recommend this Product!!!</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than other store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My device can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth to buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again when i need it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> Ordinarily I would down rate a product because of its poor packaging, but for this one, I&#x27;ll make an exception. Bought this last year to have on hand, and just now changing blades. The bubble wrap packaging is very hard and had to use kitchen shears to cut open with difficult, (maybe tin shears would work better.) A knife would be dangerous as plastic packaging is somewwhat thick and very hard. Anyway, when opening the inner blade came out OK, but the outer foil is verticle and had to be cut close by to get it out, as the plastic packaging would not tear or bend open. As the cutting took some effort, it was not well controled and I inadvertantly cut of the plastic locking piece on one side of the foil making it useless. It only hocks on the good side and flops on the cut side. I had to reuse the old foil I wanted to replace.&lt;br /&gt; Everyone has long compained about difficult to open bubble warp to little avail. I will not order another Panasonic blade and will buy a new brand of shaver when this becomes dull.&lt;br /&gt;The new inner blade with the only outer foil seems to be working OK for now.</li>
    <li> Works well, easy install, better than buying a new razor.  Might try replacing just the blades next time - to be tested.</li>
    <li> I had been using my razor for at least 3 years, and was contemplating buying a new one. Though the razor had served me well over this time, the mesh shield was bent and had a small hole in it, and my face was getting chewed up every time I shaved. In this period, I had replaced the blades a couple of times, but never the mesh guard. I saw this product, and figured it was a worth a shot since it is at least half the price of a new razor. This purchase was worth absolutely every penny. I just finished my first shave with the new kit, and it felt like a completely different razor. No cuts, no razor burn, no random missed hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this before spending 2 or 3 times the money on a new razor.</li>
    <li> Works great----used it to replace the original set.  It is like having a brand new razor--much better than replacing the whole thing!</li>
    <li> Attached without a problem. A great improvement over my worn blades. As good as new and looks original. The foil is as smooth as the original one as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased my shaver and within a few monthes when I knew I liked it I purchased the replacemnet blades and foil. The products came on time and looked like they were ok. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but when the time came to replace them I wanted them on hand. Didn&#x27;t take long to get them, they were packaged well. That&#x27;s all I can say until I use them--but there is no reason why they should not be ok</li>
    <li> renewed a close shave of my shaver, been almost a year since I got shaver.&lt;br /&gt;fit like new works well.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic shaver foil and blade set gives a close, comfortable shave as long as the skin is lubricated with moisturizer right after washing your face. I don&#x27;t use my Panasonic wet/dry shaver in the shower, but I imagine it would also do well with a light soapy film lubricating the face. The blades don&#x27;t stay sharp as long or shave as efficiently with dry shaves. Also, the Panasonic foil is so thin that it will puncture or wear through in spots after several months of use if you are not careful when using it. This allows for a closer shave but makes the product less durable over time.</li>
    <li> I bought these as replacements for my panasonic shaver and they work great, as advertised. Very straightforward and nothing complicated. Easy installation.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive way to get a new razor :)</li>
    <li> These work well. I have bought 2 and will soon buy another.</li>
    <li> Gives a shave every bit as close as a blade with much more comfort.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected... Honestly, I need to upgrade, but if you need a replacement cartridge, this is it. Really good deal as compared to stores like Walmart or Target too.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> I hate to shave, but it&#x27;s something we guys have to do. These are factory replacement parts and make my electric razor work as good as new.</li>
    <li> Works great!! I should have gotten this replacement a while back</li>
    <li> Does the job. Important to replace when needed.</li>
    <li> I had gone about 3 years without ever changing out the blade or foil on my electric razor, the shave was still decent but started pulling hairs. After I switched in the new blades and foil, I get a close cut just like I did on the first day I had the razor. No more pulling out hairs! Works awesome!</li>
    <li> I purchased the initial razor about 2 years ago, and was very pleased with the shave.  It finally started to not shave as well as it did new so I purchased the replacement shaver foil and blade set, needless to say its performance returned to normal, I am well pleased with this product.  Will buy this product again when needed.</li>
    <li> I religiously keep this thing in its stand up charger yet somehow the screen already has holes in it after a month.  The original lasted for several years, this one looks like junk already.  I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is but its extremely disappointing.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t know what other options there are.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and works just like original.  Blades dull with cleaning and need replacing a little more frequently than I think should be necessary.  Overall, good razor and can be easily maintained.</li>
    <li> Shipping from Amazon was great and fast, however my original blades on the shaver are @2.5 years old and I can not tell the difference between the old and new installed blades when I shave.  I was expecting a much smoother and sharper shave coming from new blades.</li>
    <li> I buy a new set every year just to continue having a sharp shave, best price that I have found</li>
    <li> made my shaver brand new</li>
    <li> Came quickly, worked great, fit perfectly</li>
    <li> Made my razor just like new!</li>
    <li> Second time ordering these and no complaints.</li>
    <li> Very good product, I recommend ...</li>
    <li> It was very easy to change the old set for the new one. The back of the package has easy to follow instructions.</li>
    <li> The right parts for my electric shaver and inexpensive to boot and it arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> Works and fits as expected. Nice job!</li>
    <li> Makes razor work well again.</li>
    <li> Nothing special but OK</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and works.</li>
    <li> Made my shaver work like new again so definitely would buy when my shaver is not working like it should.</li>
    <li> Good deal, easy to order.</li>
    <li> I love my Panasonic razor. It works great in a wet or dry environment but eventually the blades will dull. Replace them with these authentic blades and foil and your razor will feel like NEW! This is a no-brainer. If you shave 5-7 times a week, get a new set every year and you&#x27;ll be very happy until the battery no longer recharges!</li>
    <li> The consumables for this razor are more expensive that the razor itself.  Seems like they are taking their cue from the printer companies that sell the toner for more than the printer.  Wait, Panasonic makes printers too...  Coincidence?</li>
    <li> This is my third replacement pack and the shaver is still going strong,. Amazon again is the place to buy since the cost factor plays into the decision. If purchased anywhere else its almost not worth buying replacements and just get a new razor for a few dollars more...</li>
    <li> Easy to install and started doing a much better job at cutting as soon as I put it in and used it.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic foil and blade set ordered in January was sold as being compatible with my razor.  It is not, although I couldn&#x27;t tell until I&#x27;d removed from the blister pack. Differences are subtle but critical. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t open the package until yesterday when I decided it was really time to replace the old parts. Too late for full refund.  I notice that the current description for this replacement part  more clearly identifies the units it works with. Maybe someone else had a similar problem?</li>
    <li> if I had checked the order better before placing it. This set was for a different razor than mine. I could use the blades but the foil did not fit my razor. So, great deal, wrong razor.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a replacement foil cover and blade for my Panasonic electric shaver. It does cut for a close shave. However, it&#x27;s not nearly as good as my razer was when I first bought it new and only slightly better than it was previously before I replaced the parts. It seems to cut harsher than the original blade but DOES do its job.</li>
    <li> Great fit and made my shaver like new.</li>
    <li> Works great and shaves closer than worn blades</li>
    <li> the original blades were getting dull after a year and these did the trick.  Closeness is back to like-new and should last for another year.</li>
    <li> Perfectly compatible with PANASONIC Shaver ES-LT41-QR. Had to dig quite a bit to find this information as this model is rarely mentioned in connection with this replacement set. Passing the information on to others, hoping they find it helpful.</li>
    <li> Just like it was out if the box! Perfect cut, cleaning, and feel. I should have been buying every few months. But I will from now on.</li>
    <li> My 8109 is about a year old and I noticed a rough feeling during shaving and also small holes in the foil. I popped the 3 new pieces on and what a differance. Nice and smooth and close too.</li>
    <li> Best pricing I could find.  Excellent replacement parts.</li>
    <li> Great Value great price,  fast service</li>
    <li> GREAT REPLACEMENT BLADES. World of difference shaving. Change every year.</li>
    <li> works very well with my old es8103.</li>
    <li> No more shaver&#x27;s bumps with this razor..</li>
    <li> These replacements are made in Japan, the best  quality with very smooth operation. I will purchase again in about one year as they will easily last that long, just keep them clean.</li>
    <li> Needed a replacement, they work well!</li>
    <li> Works great as a replacement for my Panasonic razor.  Thus extending it&#x27;s useful life</li>
    <li> Fits ever one of my husbands shavers.</li>
    <li> Helped bring my razor back to life.</li>
    <li> Been using the same razor for the last few years . . . and ordering the replacement foils and blades from Amazon every 3 or 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;The Replacements have been consistent . . . Until This Last Set . . . which is not cutting as close, is a leaving my face a little more irritated to achieve a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I used this set for about 1 month and heard a popping sound while shaving. Looking at the foil i saw a hole. It was after the return period expired, so I could not return it. I&#x27;m buying one more from Amazon, but if this one does the same thing, I&#x27;ll be looking for another supplier. Also, you can find the internal blades as a set, but not the foil set alone.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted.</li>
    <li> Fit and work perfectly. However, do not maintain sharpness for long. Needs replacement about every 4 months, which works out quite expensive.</li>
    <li> After years of rotary head electric shavers that quickly break and/or do not have replacement blades available, he is trying something new. So far a smooth, close shave that is so nice and much more easily achieved. The jury is still out on how long the shaver lasts but it can&#x27;t be much worse than having to buy a new shaver every time the blades wear out.</li>
    <li> The combination razor foil and holder/cover combined with a new set of cutting blades, has returned my Panasonic razor to like new condition.  The Model 8228, which is not the most current edition in this series, has an excellent charging system and battery life appears to be no way diminished after 2+ years.  After 20 years sof using braun razors, and paying higher prices, I tried the Paasonic and have absolutely no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried earlier to locate these replacement parts at department stpoores, and evne a Panasonic re[pair and Parts facility in Singapore, but found them out of stock. Amazon had them and shipped them ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I one Happy Camper.</li>
    <li> I do not like paying so much for this head/foil combo, but Amazon has the best price AND the shaving difference after installing the new kit lets me know that the cost is worth it.</li>
    <li> Great price compared to buying in NZ.  Made it like a new razor.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, razor works like new.</li>
    <li> great razor and much cheaper than some of the others</li>
    <li> The hardest part of changing this out was opening the packaging (to be fair, it&#x27;s awful). Super easy to switch out. It creates an instant improvement in the razor. It&#x27;s not quite &#x27;good as new,&#x27; but it&#x27;s still pretty good. It is expensive (two of these gets you almost to a new razor) but I get 12-18 months of use at least of them, so it&#x27;s definitely better than going the Gilette route.</li>
    <li> Definitely the best price around, and the same product.  Works great with my shaver, and it was definitely in need of new blades...</li>
    <li> A perfect replacement head for my razor I bought at Sakuraya in Funabashi Japan. Genuine parts made in Japan, and made it perform like new again!</li>
    <li> screen does not fit the razor it says it does.  housing made completely different.  Recommend buying items separately to ensure correct fit.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the blade and foil on my Panasonic ES8109. This is the best electric shaver I have ever owned. No shaver has given me such as close, comfortable shave as this razor. I agree with other customers when they say to replace the foil and blade every year. As soon as I bought the new foil and blade set, the shaver was shaving like it was brand new.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic WES9013PC Combo Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set fits my razor perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you order the correct model.  Amazons chart was not correct when I was looking.</li>
    <li> I have Amazon auto-ship a new set of blades to me every three months and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I love the closeness I get with the Panasonic shaver and the speed with which it cleanly shaves my thick stubble. I have found that after about three months it takes longer to shave, not much longer but I have to go over my neck and jaw a few more times with a bit more pressure. By using new blades and replacing them every three months at minimal expense I get a close quick shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I shave wet and have found an excellent product to lubricate my face before I shave which doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. [[ASIN:B007O0GQPC Shea Moisture Organic Olive&amp;Green Tea Shea Butter Soap (SEALED)]]. In the shower or using the sink, I wet up my face and gently rub the bar directly over the areas I am going to shave, wet up the blade and just shave. The soap is so gentle and makes my skin so smooth the shaver glides across my face removing all the stubble effortlessly WITHOUT any irritation. Afterwards, I rinse my face with cold water and the moisturizers in the soap actually make it feel softer. My girlfriend now comments favorably about how smooth my face feels, no longer scratchy. I have used virtually every shaving gel and cream and never got this smooth a shave without cuts and irritation. When I travel on a plane, I just cut a piece of the bar off and keep it in my travel kit. The bar is large and will last a very long time so don&#x27;t let the price put you off, it is worth every penny. Smooth shaving!</li>
    <li> This replacemant fit perfectly and my razor now shaves as good as new.  My old foil was pulling my wiskers causing pain. I will purchase this this set again.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and came super fast</li>
    <li> This is your blade and foil cover replacement set - you are locked into getting this if you desire to keep you Panasonic razor staying sharp. It does seem like the newer replacement versions a bit dull compared to previous ones, but if you want your razor to work, it&#x27;s a good idea to replace the blade and foil set for that close shave. Pricey for what it is, but you don&#x27;t really have much of a choice.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for replacement foil and blades, back to a smooth quick shave as if the razor was new... if only the razor would have continued to operate as well...  These were for a ES 8109.  Two years old and the display began to work intermittently then the battery gave up.... designed obsolescence I guess, or just a limitation of the components.  I replaced it with an ES8103 an excellent shave, can&#x27;t find replacement foil/blades for it... just as well, the battery is fading along with the charge level indicator.  It says 60% charge but dies, sometimes before I&#x27;m done shaving.  What do you do with old razors?  Take out the batteries and dispose of them safely and scrap the rest, I guess.</li>
    <li> It does its job well.</li>
    <li> Works great. It is definitely a great idea to upgrade the blades AND foil screen to make sure you&#x27;re getting the best out of your electric razor. I personally use mine in the field and it is a life saver.</li>
    <li> I switched from a Braun Shaver to Panasonic and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The shaver is great + much cheaper and the replacement shaver foil  and Blade Set is much cheaper too. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Look at the picture to see the models that it fits.  The customer comments are not necessarily true.  This did not fit mine and it was not worth the hassel of returning it.</li>
    <li> I just needed to change one part but I decided to buy both and bought, I replaced them and my shaver is like new. The price was reasonable</li>
    <li> Panasonic inner blade and outer foil set is original quality and very easy to install.</li>
    <li> Razor cuts like new again, you forget how good it was with fresh blades and foils.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!  Shipped in a timely fashion and for a fair price.  Now I can get another 2 years out of my electric razor..</li>
    <li> Works great and saved some money from buying at the store!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I had considered buying a new electric razor. However, the battery life on  Panasonic razor was holding a charge for a week after three years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy new foil and cutting blades, was the best decision I ever made. I am now getting a closer shave, trimming at least three minutes off my shave time. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> These replacement blades are great and necessary. I change them out every year and a few + months. I am a bit thrifty and they could be changed out sooner but they really do last long. The shaver itself has been doing great. I dropped it once and it rendered the charge screen slightly disfunctional with the numbers unreadable on some digits. Surprisingly enough the problem seems to have gone away - after almost a year with the said problem. I am satisfied to stick with the product until it expires.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after using my shaver daily for about a year. I was beginning to experience a less than satisfactory shave. This replacement blade set was just the job. The shaver&#x27;s performance is back to what it was when brand new. It also shipped quickly to an APO in Afghanistan.</li>
    <li> This blade is the only kind my husband will use. Packaging was new, blade is effective and the price was much lower than in stores. Great service and price - can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Panasonic razors and blades offer great value for the price. These blades work very well and with proper cleaning (foam soap, run the razor and rinse), have lasted about a year. I bought the Panasonic razor locally, but could not find replacement blades. Thankfully Amazon came through. I have tried every popular brand and Panasonic razors are the best. Their selling point is the blade angle and it is absolutely true. The blades cut quickly and leave your face very smooth. I hate shaving, so there is a heavy 3 day growth by Monday morning. These cut through it in a few minutes and without the painful hair pulling of other razors. The only knock on Panasonic razors is that you cannot use them while plugged in. They charge quickly though.</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than it&#x27;s a perfect match for my electric razor. Thought I would help out by saying that it matched the previous blades exactly. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Last 6-12 months depending on the amount of time you shave. Less expensive buying the combo kit, than individually. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and as described.  With this reasonably priced replacement foil and blade my husband&#x27;s shaver will get in another couple of years of service.</li>
    <li> My razor works like new again.  Delivery was quick and installation easy.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied fit perfectly. I have no complaints. I would defiantly purchase these in the future when I need them.</li>
    <li> Works fine but I did not see a performance increase when I installed these on my 3 year old razor. If it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it I guess.</li>
    <li> Its been a long time since I have had electric razor but I believe this one to be excelent</li>
    <li> good replacement blades and foil no problems!</li>
    <li> Works just fine with my razor that need to have both blade and the foil. No complains</li>
    <li> Panasonic gives me the closest shave ever. Also I like the wet shave helps with face so it wont break out.</li>
    <li> My razor is like new now. I received this shipment quickly and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Makes razor work like new. Didn&#x27;t realized how badly I needed to replace these components.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad. Replacement blades are brand new and worth the cost. It is part of keeping your shaver in good condition.</li>
    <li> After three years I replaced my shaver foil and blades. What a difference, a nice close shave again. I bought two replacement sets, so I&#x27;m set for awhile.</li>
    <li> Dear Sir /Madam&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic WES9013PC Combo Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set working great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks  they fantastic  but i don&#x27;t get the discount as you state it</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver. I went ahead and decided to get the cartridge refills for ease and am so glad I did.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, simply click out the old click in the new. It feels like a new razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the packaging was lethal to open; very difficult highly rigid plastic sealed pack which broke open to leave knife-sharp edges that scratched your hands like a baby cougar on an all-sugar diet. Why do manufacturers do this?</li>
    <li> just as described and prompt shipping</li>
    <li> This is second time I used replacement for my shaver and even first time I noticed that it was not as good as new. My kid was taking my shaver and I bought new one for him as well as this replacement for myself and there is a huge difference between OEM and this @#$#$. will be looking for a new shaver on sale next time.</li>
    <li> why would you go out and hunt down  replacement foil and  blades for one of the best shavers out there. automatically gets delivered to your mailbox in a timely fashion, you set the frequency.</li>
    <li> These parts are exactly what I needed for my Panasonic wet/dry razor. The price I paid for the combination items was much better than what was offered by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear that replacement blades are able to get anywhere near as sharp as original blades. It makes for a difficult shave.</li>
    <li> Back like new. Was thinking of getting a new razor, but not now, these seem to last forever.</li>
    <li> Once a year it is nice to get a &amp;#34;new razor&amp;#34;.  Put in these new blades and foil and you will think you got a new razor.  Well worth the price.  Very easy to install.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  This product fills me need.  This product was shipped to my house.  I use this product every day.  I like this product very much.  It was convenient ordering this product.  I am happy with this product.  I will order this product again when the current product wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is that enough words for you idiots, Amazon?</li>
    <li> I have to laugh at myself for not replacing these blades sooner. It was like a new shaver. It was only like 30 bucks for a good shave again. Do yourself a favor.  Replace your blades every year or sooner. It works wonders for your shave!&lt;br /&gt;YES I recommend!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Razor cuts like a champ again after 2 years on the original.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> These will make your shaver work just like it did when it was brand new.  I try to replace my blades once a year.  These exact blades fit my specific shaver and I will continue to purchase these each year.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how important it is to replace the screen with new blades.  It made a huge difference over just changing the blades.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would like an electric shaves so much, until I found myself buying replacement parts for it.</li>
    <li> They are a perfect replacement for the Panasonic ES-LT71.</li>
    <li> Although I accurately stated my shaver model number, Amazon recommended the wrong foil set which does not fit my razor.  Now I have two sets I cannot use.</li>
    <li> Received quickly. Operates as expected.</li>
    <li> Not like a brand new shaver, but pretty darn close.  Much less expensive than prior Panasonic replacement parts and the combo pack makes it easy.</li>
    <li> These fit my favorite shaver:  Panasonic ES-8103.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of shavers: Remington, Norelco, Braun, and more.  The one I have now is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> Works as expected .Priced just right.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, especially for furry men like me.</li>
    <li> Great price, I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed - it&#x27;s amazing the difference a new set of blades and a new screen make in razor performance.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but replacing the shaver foil and blade set made a huge difference.  I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my shaves had become until I replaced the foil and blade.  It was immediately closer.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Panasonic electric razor about a year ago, and I figure one year is a pretty solid life expectancy for a razor cutting block and foil. Usually, the foils get damaged before the blades seem to dull, and this was the case with my razor. Due to some mishap or short fall, my foil was damaged and was scratching up my face when I shaved. I looked for replacement foils, but they only seem to be sold WITH the cutting block. Since I figured on buying both items anyway, this wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Still, I wish these items were sold separately. You never know when one or the other will need replacing, and I don&#x27;t like the idea of having to purchase both if I only need one or the other.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t seem to last very long before you can&#x27;t get a close shave.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this set I was not aware of one thing. The shaver is called a &amp;#34;3 Head&amp;#34; shaver but when looking at it I only saw 2 heads. After replacement it still didn&#x27;t work like new because it didn&#x27;t cut the long hairs.&lt;br /&gt;After I took a long look I realized that the third head was actually part of the foil head. The head is actuated by a small part which sticks up between the 2 other heads. It sticks up into the foil head and the vibration of the heads also vibrates the 3rd head.&lt;br /&gt;In my shaver this part had become worn and was now loose and was not moving the blades in the third head.&lt;br /&gt;I used some fine wire (26awg) and was able to construct a loop which closed the part onto the head and once again provided the vibration to activate the 3rd head.&lt;br /&gt;It now works like brand new.</li>
    <li> PURCHSED FOR MY SON&#x27;S RAZOR AND HE&#x27;S SATISFIED, GETTING A GREAT SHAVE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Did not improve performance that much as I was expecting it would . I am not sure I would recommend the product to a friend.</li>
    <li> As good as new. New is good but not great.</li>
    <li> good price for oem replacement parts</li>
    <li> These work for about 1 year if you shave once a week until you get weird irritation due to dull blades. I know it says 6 months, but I dont shave every day, so it might be different for everyone.</li>
    <li> The replacement screen and blades worked perfectly.  I had forgotten what a wonderfully smooth shave the razor was capable of.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> This product was a perfect fit for my ES8901 shaver.  I have had no issues, and I am able to continue using my shaver as if it is brand new!</li>
    <li> The price is right for ordering this with the shaver...so you have it whenever you need it.  Items are shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> This renews your older shaver and is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;It is the original part from panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;The times for replacement is suggested times.  Replace it when needed- you will know when.&lt;br /&gt;It is best to buy the combo pack(blade and foil)&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried to  shave wet- give it try.  Also take the shaver in. The shower for a smooth shave</li>
    <li> Works great and fit perfect. Should have replaced the blades long ago. I will reorder again.</li>
    <li> This is the best replacement for my ES8109 Panasonic electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my shaver like new again. Good close comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using the manufacturers replacement parts.</li>
    <li> Worked for me.  Waited about almost two years to replace original and was starting to get a few nicks and cuts.  replaced the blade and foil with these and much nicer shave.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect replacement for my 2 year old Panasonic shaver (which I love) and for $25 this made it good as new and I plan to get another 2 years worth of use out of it.  Replacing the blades helps give a closer shave, takes less time, and feels more comfortable when using it.  If your old Panasonic shaver needs a tune up, this will definitely help.</li>
    <li> EL PRODUCTO LLEGO OK, TAL Y COMO LO OFRECIERON ESTOY TOTALMENTE SATISFECHO CON EL MISMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMIENDO AL VENDEDOR ES BASTANTE RESPONSABLE</li>
    <li> This product is half the price of just the screen from Panasonic. If u put the slightest dent in your screen, the blade will cut through it when u turn it on. If you take like a ink pen clicker, something small enough and rounded on the sides and push the dent out from the inside it will prevent this. But if you need a new screen, this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I have to replace these parts every year and always purchase them on Amazon.  The shaver works like new after the change over that only takes a minute.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Product was damaged when received,the shaver Foil was crimped and one tab was broken.The blade set was ok. The Combo was incased in a plastic pack and was not crushed it appeared it was damaged during the packaging process.</li>
    <li> I love the durability, I actually used my first set twice as long as recommended without problem, it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a rotary like the Norelco but I don&#x27;t have the irritation that comes with a rotary either.</li>
    <li> I have bought several Panasonic razors over the years and only use the genuine Panasonic replacement blade and foil.  For my beard type this replacement lasts me just about a year.</li>
    <li> great item, a little pricey</li>
    <li> First time my husband ever used an electric razor. Now have used it for 8 months. He had to - as he was on blood thinners for a time.  He loves it.  Once in a while he resorts back to the straight razor - but overall - he couldn&#x27;t believe how nice a shave it does.</li>
    <li> I have had my Panasonic electric razor for several years, and this is the second screen and blade replacement kit I have installed.  And, Panasonic seems to have upgraded this screen/blade kit since I bought the last one, because the comfort and closeness improvement was evident as soon as I installed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation is a one minute job, if that.  Just snap out the old parts, and snap  in the new.  If this is the kit that fits your razor, and if the blade and screen in your razor have a year or two of use, buy this kit.  You need it and you will love it.</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised and razor runs smooth and quiet</li>
    <li> They arrived quick and were just as described.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly for the LT-71</li>
    <li> This is an exact replacement for the original blades and foil screen.  The replacement process was very fast and easy.</li>
    <li> Not the &amp;#34;oh my gawd&amp;#34; difference I was hoping for...shaving did improve over the 4 year old screen/blade it replaced and the shaves were definitely more comfortable with less pulling. I was hoping for the night and day difference some mention but in the end it&#x27;s still shaving, on my face, and I hate the whole routine but what can ya do? Installed easily despite not matching the model number of my shaver exactly and the price was right. Shipped quickly and was easy to open.</li>
    <li> Replaced my original set after one year. My razor is as good as new. Great rotor for a dry shave. Go with the grain!</li>
    <li> It works well. Simple as that. (I need 14 more words to post this comment) It works well. It works well. :&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> My razor now shaves like a brand new one !!  Money well spent. Install (very easy), and you are ready to go.  Why did I wait so long to do this?  You shouldn&#x27;t - get it now.</li>
    <li> We were long overdue in replacing my husband&#x27;s foil and blades so we took the plunge.  What a difference it made!  Shaves much better and easier without having to go over a spot multiple times.  It was easy to change things out-only took a couple minutes.</li>
    <li> i bought this item witn panasonic es8103s men&#x27;s 3-blade wet/dry electric shaver...&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s good and good price.. i am satisfied..</li>
    <li> Made in Japan. Excellent quality, last longer and stay sharper compared to other replacement brands that were made in other asian country.</li>
    <li> I have a ES-LT71-S for mostly one year, and get this to replace the inner Blade and Outer Foil. Now it is used like a new one.</li>
    <li> My husband was very happy that I was able to find these electric razor replacements for Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I just replace the blades. I always used Panasonic shaver and recommend because it is excellent. Currently use the model Panasonic Es8103S&#x27;S Men Wet / Dry Shaver</li>
    <li> The foil had a defect - a small nick, and cut my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then had a used foil that I went back to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was a bit crushed, but I do not know if it was a manufacturers defect or a problem with the shiipping that caused the defect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not  a problem with your organization.</li>
    <li> Waited too long to buy this replacement set.  It took the razor from a bushhog operation back to its original perfection.  Won&#x27;t make that mistake again - putting off the blade  update.  Go ahead and buy it if you have the razor.</li>
    <li> Snapped right in, perfect fit, shaves like new again.</li>
    <li> This unit is one of the best, I have had others over the years. Comfortable shaver, charge last a long time.</li>
    <li> It was amazing how a new foil and and blade will improve your razor.  This product works great!  If you notice the difference then you waited too long to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a related note, if you do \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; on this item there is a good chance you will receive a broken foil. It is shipped USPS and is just packaged in a cardboard mailer with no padding. I do not feel this should be part of the rating as it is not a direct reflection of the product.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement and easy to change</li>
    <li> I package arrived ripped and the piece was broken. But nothing a little crazy glue couldn&#x27;t fix. I had to buy  this replacement cause the mesh cover chipped away a piece of the covering a week. So it wouldn&#x27;t nick my skin. The shaver cost to inch money and is on par with my $20 shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro. Battery last a long time for traveling. And charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves close. But not great for black people, cause you can&#x27;t get that outline we like.</li>
    <li> The shaver now cuts like the day I got it. Really noticeable difference between this and the old blade. Easy installation, too.</li>
    <li> There was no protective packaging provided for this item.The bubble pack was put into a regular envelope and couriered.&lt;br /&gt;As evident from the attached photo,the plastic latch on one side has broken and hence does not fit into the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Considering the fact that this is being shipped long distance, a more protecting packaging needs to be provided.I do not think it makes sense monetary wise to ship it back.&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 kindle and purchase and have had good experience with the online transaction hence went ahead and made this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Please check if anything can be done on this.&lt;br /&gt;I am willing to ship it back to any local (Indian) address.&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;Vinod Nair&lt;br /&gt;+91 9940579944</li>
    <li> Great replacement.  this is my 2nd replacement over 2  years and they work wonderfully.  Just like having a new shaver again!</li>
    <li> Got just what I needed. Did take a little while to get to me but I was happy with it just the same.</li>
    <li> Should have purchased months ago. Makes a huge differences in shaving. It is like getting a new razor for half price.</li>
    <li> Have been using for years with the Panasonic ES8103S shaver. I order the new blade and foil about once a year.</li>
    <li> Shaver is cutting closer now....good replacement</li>
    <li> Works great but the price is kinda high for this.  Sometimes the whole razer goes on sale for a little more than just the razer cost.  Other than the high price, the product works very well though</li>
    <li> Using the screen and blade made my 2-year old razor shave like new.  My face is thankful.  It is much smoother.  My wife approves!</li>
    <li> Made the shaver work like new! It runs more quietly, the battery lasts longer, it it shaves smoothly and easily again.</li>
    <li> No issues whatsoever. Exactly what was advertised</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every month for years. Great replacement blades and foils. Tip: Olive oil extends life of product.</li>
    <li> My shaver works fine, but I didn&#x27;t realise how it had gone blunt over the years. A fresh set of blades, and it&#x27;s cutting smooth again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is as advertised. Performs well</li>
    <li> This unit is half the price of Braun series 7, quiter, smaller.  The cleaning station is also smaller and quiter.  The cleaning cartridges are also half the price go Braun.  The shave is quick and super close without any irritation.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and in good shape.  I needed a new foil because the screen on the old one had developed holes over time, causing the shaver to scrape or cut my skin as I shaved. The new foil and blade worked great; however, I have noticed that after less than a month a hole has started to form in the screen.  I am afraid that they are not using the same quality of stainless steel on these as Panasonic did on the original.  I may have to return it for a replacement.[[ASIN:B001J6O0JG Panasonic WES9013PC Combo Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set]]</li>
    <li> Great original product. I live in Australia and including postage this was about 1/2 price! Feels like a new razor again. Thanks heaps!</li>
    <li> why this stuff so expensive?</li>
    <li> This set brought my shaver back to live.  It now is almost as good as new.  Bring your razor back to live too.!!</li>
    <li> Replacement foil &amp; blade set arrived on time and works great.  Made a new razor out of old one.  Forgot how dull my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; razor had become.  Would highly recommend for a much closer shave...</li>
    <li> This is a cost effective combination of these items.  I was only going to replace the foil, but the price difference to also get the blades was so small getting the set made more sense!</li>
    <li> I did not realize how dull the cutters were in my Panasonic shaver until I took the replacements out of the package. I must remember to replace the blades and screen each year.</li>
    <li> I have a VERY OLD set, from a 8103 that&#x27;s over a decade old! (yes, they can last that long).  I find the old set can cut lower than the new set.  I put in the new set and could hear no sound of it cutting stubble left from previously cutting with the old set (foil and blades).  When I put in the old set again I could hear a little cutting.  I guess the old foil is thinner or something.  Unless your set breaks, there is no reason to buy a new set.  Also, I still get over a weeks worth of shaves from a charge from the razor which from what I can tell is way longer than the 3-5 days you get from a new one.  Oh well, $35 wasted on listening to babbling fools.</li>
    <li> I lost one of the cutter heads on my panasonic razor and this replacement foil blade set was just the ticket.  Razor shaves like it is new out of the box; should have done this several years ago per the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions but better late than never</li>
    <li> Your razor will feel basically like day 1 all over again. Smooth and sharp! I am ahead shaver, and I need these once a year!</li>
    <li> I got this for my shaver that I have been using for 5+ years and was ready to give up on. This made it like new.</li>
    <li> I bought this package to replace the foil and blades on my Panasonic ES8109 Vortex razor. The come conveniently paired as seen in the product picture and are easy to change out.</li>
    <li> Greatly improved performance after swapping out these parts.  Very easy installation but a bit pricey. Shaver works well for sure!!</li>
    <li> This kit is good for replacement blades and head for my Panasonic shaver. It was quick and easy to replace them and then immediately start shaving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always a pleasure to shave with a new blade and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> The replacement parts did not fit my razor! I had to throw them away! I will order replacement parts directly from Panasonic, in the future!</li>
    <li> Fits ES8103 no problem.  Also, Panasonic has various rec&#x27;s on when to replace the outer foil/ inner blades... etc...  Do yourself a favor and replace both every 10 - 12 months.  With a kit like this at this cost there is really no reason not to.  You will feel the effects immediately and thank yourself.  Seriously, at around 30 bucks every year, why wouldn&#x27;t you?  Also, removing inner blades is simple.  Just gently push down, over, and up and it will pop off.  Insertion is reverse.  Replacing the outer foil and two inner blades took all of 15 seconds and my face couldn&#x27;t be happier.  DEFINITELY fits ES8103.</li>
    <li> Lasts typically two years.  This is my second replacement.  So shaver life is extended to two more years or until battery dies whichever comes first.</li>
    <li> I bought this foil &amp; blade set combo because the foil that came with my Panasonic ES8109 was damaged with a noticeable hole near the middle. I used it for 3 years, which I imagine is longer than the average life span because I only shave once per week. I initially only wanted the replacement foil, but Amazon.com&#x27;s $27.24 deal is the best around to pass up, even though I&#x27;m in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the replacement parts for the first time, I&#x27;m glad I purchased the blades as well.  The blades are just as sharp as I remember using the shaver for the first time.  I never realized my first pair were dull.  Not just sharp, but the shaving experience was that it felt \\&quot;light\\&quot;.  As long as care is taken, I foresee these will last as long as the previous ones.</li>
    <li> I do not know that I would rate any electric razor products any different.  None have ever met my expectations for a close shave.</li>
    <li> Item just as described, perfect replacement for worn razor blades. Shaving much easier &amp; faster this morning.</li>
    <li> My old blades must have been on for ages because these new blades made such a huge difference.</li>
    <li> worked great and installed easily.</li>
    <li> Just bought the Panasonic so I thought I would get a back-up blade and screen.  Sipped quickly.  Love the razor too</li>
    <li> This will extend the life of my favorite shaver for several more years and a very reasonable cost.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I finally replaced the original blades and foil after 2 years of use. The new set cuts quicker with smoother results.</li>
    <li> very very good..value for money would reccommend to anyone who owns a panasonic elictric shaver cant get better than this</li>
    <li> As described, pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> Like having a new razor. Used mine for over a year and it started pinching, making a mess, and not shaving as quickly or as closely. 30 second swap with new foil and blades and the difference is like night and day. Brand new razor essentially for whatever this costs, well worth it.</li>
    <li> I thought I was needing a new set of blades but maybe not.  While these sound different they dont shave any closer or get the stray hairs any more than the old ones.  Perhaps I spent money I didn&#x27;t need to.  My old foil was in good shape, no breaks or holes.  Those are definately signs you need new.</li>
    <li> Like having a new razor!  Should have done this much earlier!  In fact, I think I&#x27;m getting closer shaves than when the razor was nrw!</li>
    <li> New blades are the best.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly into the 9103. Longevity remains to be seen.</li>
    <li> Provides a good close shave, no nicks or burns.  Easy to clean and long lasting.  In my third year of use and on first replacement of foil and blade.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same blades for 4 years I swear. I just noticed a hole in my foil and decided to replace the blades and foil. Just like new again. Smooth and quiet and a nice soft face again! Do it!</li>
    <li> Why are electric toothbrushes (and their accessories) so expensive?  Why is floss expensive?  Why is this and other shaver parts expensive?  Why am I so cheap?  I will probably never find out the answers to these questions, but for the time being, I will have to say that if you need to shave often, and you have this particular shaver model, you are probably going to buy this regardless of what I say.  Keeping your shaver parts nice and new is always a good idea, so if you really need it, just buy it.  That&#x27;s what I did.  And now that&#x27;s why I am rating this product.  I should probably stop rating things though, since I don&#x27;t do anything but babble on excessively.  What the heck am I doing, still typing?  I should stop.  You aren&#x27;t learning anything new from this review.</li>
    <li> Brought new life to a decade old razor. Was looking for new razor and found this and saved a lot of money and didn&#x27;t have to choose between all the bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> Replacement blades for the best shaver in the world.</li>
    <li> i replaced my earlier blades with the new set i purchased from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was satisfied, this new blade set feels like i bought a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Bought for our son for Christmas. He orders these every year ans is completely satified with their performance. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Panasonic (ES8103S) shaver along with the blade set. I will review this product in the future since I have&lt;br /&gt;not put it in service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I recommended Panasonic Shaver. It is goof a very good value for the cost. I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance. I&#x27;ve had&lt;br /&gt;several shavers through the years and this is the best shave for the money!! Recharge-time is very good and last just as stated for two weeks or more.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews on this product, I decided to try them. They are very good as &amp;#34;as advertised&amp;#34;.  Razor shaves like new again.</li>
    <li> I had my razor for over 2 years and decided to finally change the blade an foil.  It works better but not too much better. Overall if you keep your razor clean and dry (except to wash) the blades and the quality shave last a long time. There really is no need to change them unless there is visible wear</li>
    <li> Simple switch to get like new use out of your shaver. My son has very heavy beard growth. He replaces the blades every 4 months to keep a smooth and close shave.</li>
    <li> This is one of those items that you don&#x27;t realize you needed until you buy it. I was thinking about replacing my razor as the battery life was getting so short but I guess I hadn&#x27;t realized that it was taking me so long to shave that I was only getting about 4 or 5 shaves to a charge. With the new blades, the razor shaves so much faster and smoother that I have shaved twice now on 20% of my battery. It is also much quieter. I need to not wait a year and a half before I change these because while I think it is shaving fine, it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I was originally looking only for the foil, but I don&#x27;t regret getting the blade, my Panasonic Razor I bought in 2009, it worked just fine, but then the foil cover decayed and a part of it was teared, I couldn&#x27;t use it because it scratched my face, after I bought it, I changed the the inner blades as well, and wow, I missed this feeling of smooth, dry 2 minutes shave. won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: make sure your razor model is written on the back of package</li>
    <li> The new foil and blade work great -- makes the razor  as good as new.  It does install very easily, a matter of  seconds, AFTER you get the package open, a matter of minutes.</li>
    <li> Perked my old razor right up! Excellent!</li>
    <li> Cheapest price I could find and delivered rather fast  :)</li>
    <li> product as described, shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Leaves me with a close shave every time.  It recharges in less than an hour.</li>
    <li> These replacements make the shaver work like new. The new, sharpness feeling, seems to wear off after a few weeks, but they continue to work well. I replace them after a year, but I think they could go longer. The price is right.</li>
    <li> The razor is great but the plastic covering it is so tough that I accidently cut into the outer foil and had to order another one. There should be some better way to open the product with risking damage to it--maybe perforations in the plastic or the cardboard backing.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a senior friend of the family and for my husband.  They both enjoy it&#x27;s use.  My husband doesn&#x27;t use everyday but it can be a timesaver when needed!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my rasor ! All you need to replace the cutting head.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t seem as sharp</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my ES8103.  Less expensive than the recommended item.</li>
    <li> installed and smooth.</li>
    <li> As advertised! great replacement blades</li>
    <li> Bought this replacement for my husbands razor twice, and have been extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> the replacement blades worked well but I couldn&#x27;t ever&lt;br /&gt;get the shave as close as when the razor was new.  So&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a new panasonic razor a little later.</li>
    <li> five stars says it all</li>
    <li> Perfect OEM replacement parts for a Panasonic razor. Combo pack provides better value than individual purchases of the included items</li>
    <li> Works well. My original ones worked for 6 years with no issues, I just felt it was time to change them.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades last me a year and for the price that&#x27;s a pretty inexpensive shave.</li>
    <li> These replacement blades are just what I ordered and they were shipped promptly and fit the razor intended..  They are sharp and made the razor good as new !  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done very effectively.</li>
    <li> Nothing quite like putting new blades into a shaver.  They worked perfectly and the shaver now cuts like new again.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo39P42XDLZCPMK]]Both foil and blade are exact fit to my Panasonic ES8103, also fits on models: ES8109, 8101, GA21, LT71, LT41 and SL41. Good quality, Made in Japan !  fast shipping. Thanks</li>
    <li> My Panasonic razor gave the best results of any system I had used.  When it started irritating my face, I knew there was something wrong.  I bought the foil and blade set, but I just used the foil.  The blades are in the drawer for when I need them.  The new foil restored my shaver to the same efficiency as new.  I like this system so much I gave one to my son for Christmas.  This is a great way to remain satisfied with an excellent razor.</li>
    <li> This is the  name brand replacement cutter and foil kit. The price is right and it&#x27;s the right stuff for my shaver.</li>
    <li> I have the ES8103, and this replacement screen and the blades are perfect. They clip on easily and cut a nice close shave, like when my Panasonic was new</li>
    <li> I have just bought this combo replacement for my shaver, they are easy to change and working perfectly. The last one I used last for 3 years so hopefully this one as well</li>
    <li> This replacement cover and blade set returned my razor to like-new status. I could not be happier and I will pay closer attention now, so I can determine a regular replacement schedule. Excellent item for you electric razor users whose razors accept this set. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The price isright anvery easy to use</li>
    <li> Easy to replace and works like new.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Made my razor feel like a brand new one!</li>
    <li> Good price for restoring your shaver to like-new status. Very easy removal and replacement. Not really much more to say, but I haven&#x27;t reached Amazon&#x27;s word limit yet. Now I have. Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> I have preferred Panasonic electric razors for years.  I was considering having to get a replacement, but this kit replaces all of the cutting surfaces and restored my razor to new performance.  No more pulling and quicker shaves.</li>
    <li> Very easy installation, no tools needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as it installed looked like a brand new shaver. Even the sound was different.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic ES8109 for almost two years. Although it was working fine, I decided to change the blades as recommended by the manufacturer. Since the foil and blade combo was not too much more expensive than just the blades, I decided to change both the foil and the blades. First of all, it was very easy to replace them. It shaves better with the new blades and the new foil, but what surprised me most was how quietly it runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this shaver for two more years, and replace it with a comparable model, rather than replacing the blades and the foil again.</li>
    <li> Well it replaced my faulty one. What is there more to say? Was easy to install. Worked after install perfectly.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend asked me to purchase this for him since I have a Prime account. He was happy to receive the replacement set because he&#x27;s able to get a closer shave and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; on his stubble when he&#x27;s trying to shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Panasonic razor for three years and I had started to notice that it wasn&#x27;t cutting as closely as it once did, so I sprung for this. My razor is in great shape, so I thought this was a good investment instead of purchasing a completely new (and expensive) razor. This was a simple fix and my razor cuts as closely as it did when it was brand new.  Good purchase to extend the life of a good razor.</li>
    <li> had to order this before i my vacation trip.  my foil and blade was all worn out and this replacement made a better shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m user of Panasonic shavers for ten years or so.  When I&#x27;ve changed the foil and blade the shaver worked as an absolutely new one.</li>
    <li> The replacement appears to be as good as the original item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your service is beyound what I expected. There are so few companies today that even understand quality, service, &amp; all in value.</li>
    <li> I bought it to replace my three years old foil and blade. For the price I paid for, it worked good.</li>
    <li> Feels like a new razor every time I change the blades.</li>
    <li> I have had the Panasonic razor for several years now.  Foil &amp; Blade only needs replacing every 12-18 months.  Best razor ever for me.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a nice close shave. It removes the unwanted hair from your face. It really takes off the hair. Good for hair removal from your face.</li>
    <li> I replaced the blades on my shaver after two years of daily use.  This set works great.  I suspect it will last as long as the original with proper care.</li>
    <li> Out with the old, in with the new, and you&#x27;re back in business.  I had let the set that came with the razor get too clogged up with hair and pre-shave solutions, so I at least rinse off or put soap on the blades and run the razor in sonic mode to prevent them from getting in bad shape like the last set.  Not a bad price for a razor tune up.</li>
    <li> quick delivery ofcorrect replacement part</li>
    <li> good product at a good price and shipped promptly</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted.</li>
    <li> Shaving head foil broke after 2 months of routine use.  Specifically, it developed a hole in the foil.  Unhappy with quality of these OEM parts.</li>
    <li> We use several of the panasonic razors.  The foil screenes do not last long and they are very expensive.</li>
    <li> The shaver foil is not the best quality.  It is very thin and I know it will not last as long.  Just taking it out of the package almost damaged the foil and I had to gently fix it and put it on the shaver.</li>
    <li> They are replacement razor blades. They work as expected and extend the life of a great electric razor. I recommend buying these while they remain available.</li>
    <li> I just hope Panasonic continues to make this foil and blade replacement unit. Many shavers go out of manufacture quickly</li>
    <li> My husband needed this replacement set, and I looked all over and found it for a reasonably price and it was in stock!</li>
    <li> The WES9013PC blade/foil set brought my Panasonic Razor back to original condition. Panasonic recommends replacing annually. I went a couple months longer to stretch mu money&#x27;s worth. But I sure can tell the difference now. Although you can purchase blades and foil separately, I recommend replacing as a set. Pricing is cheaper overall when purchased together.</li>
    <li> My razor has worked well since I bought it and these replacement blades fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very suitable, with good, then I will continue to buy it, because it&#x27;s as perfect and original, and I very like</li>
