      <li>A very light, clean, moisturizing toner.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very mild and make my skin brightly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The Yonka Lotion PS Toner makes a huge difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>Getting things from home was a challenge as I had to accurately describe what what needed, what it looked like, and</li>
      <li>The spray top works perfectly with minimum amount of mist, so the bottle last for a long time (4-5 months).  </li>
      <li>The dry skin formula nourished my winter skin very nicely.  </li>

      <li>I cant be without it and am sure to order more the moment my bottle gets low!</li>
      <li>Yonka&#x27;s products are fantastic and rely on use of many natural plants.</li>
      <li>The bottle it comes in is beautiful - it&#x27;s glass and quite heavy.</li>
      <li>Some things are worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I spray it around in the air to give my bedroom a fresh smell.</li>
      <li>Maybe my favorite facial product ever.  </li>
      <li>I especially like it during the summer when the humidity is overwhelming.</li>
      <li>so I had absolutely nothing - no clothes, not even my wedding ring.</li>
      <li>Gentle and hydrates your skin</li>
      <li>I opted for the toner as it can be applied after a shower or any time during the day and it leaves anyone&#x27;s skin glowing, fresh feeling, with no dry or pinched feeling.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>, just give your face a spray, and the dry tight skin is relieved , and the smell makes you feel good all over, I recommend this product to almost any one, I can&#x27;t imagine why someone would not like this stuff, I&#x27;ve found I MUST have it , another toner does not do what this does , tones , moisturizes , lifts your emotion with soothing smells and feelings.</li>
      <li>Natural ingredients are appreciated.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin all my life and still have blemishes in my &#x27;50&#x27;s, but Yonka offers gentle but through cleansing.</li>
      <li>However, my husband not only noticed the same things but actually commented about them on his own volition.</li>
      <li>I normally can&#x27;t stand things with fragrance on my face,  but this one is calming.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
      <li>e-mail reply has blunt asking for a photo of the product (which is not the bottle you see on Amazon, but a new design) and asking why it took me 1 month to e-mail them.</li>
      <li>I love this yonka toner lotion , it&#x27;s an instant relief for stress dryness , need a little moisture ,</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the Yonka Lotion PS Toner for use under any facial lotion.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and its not irritating or greasy like some other products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line- If stuck on a desert island with only one skin care item, clearly this would be it.</li>
      <li>Its so light and has such a delicate fragrance.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I was hoping the bottle would stop leaking because it&#x27;s so difficult for me to find time to do personal e-mails.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for years.  It instantly reliefs dry skin after cleaning face or jumping out of shower.  The spray top works perfectly with minimum amount of mist, so the bottle last for a long time (4-5 months).  I put it in a small spray jar, and carry it in my purse, I use it whenever I need to moist my face.  The spray has very soothing fragrance, like lavender, light and pleasant.  I normally can&#x27;t stand things with fragrance on my face,  but this one is calming.  I&#x27;ve tried other expensive brand toners and always come back to this one.  Love it and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The Yonka Lotion PS Toner makes a huge difference in my skin. I use it under Yonka&#x27;s Elastine Jour.  When I started using Yonka products I felt a difference in my skin, but the biggest testament was friends who commented on how good my skin looked.  The pricing for these products is best here on Amazon.com.  I highly recommend the Yonka Lotion PS Toner for use under any facial lotion.</li>
    <li> A very light, clean, moisturizing toner.  It&#x27;s a nice refreshing wake up in the morning, too. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this yonka toner lotion , it&#x27;s an instant relief for stress dryness , need a little moisture , no need to redo make-up, just give your face a spray, and the dry tight skin is relieved , and the smell makes you feel good all over, I recommend this product to almost any one, I can&#x27;t imagine why someone would not like this stuff, I&#x27;ve found I MUST have it , another toner does not do what this does , tones , moisturizes , lifts your emotion with soothing smells and feelings.</li>
    <li> Have used products for years.</li>
    <li> Such an agreable feeling on the skin! And it shows how dry and deshydrated your skin may be at some times.</li>
    <li> I love this refreshing toner.  Its so light and has such a delicate fragrance. I cant be without it and am sure to order more the moment my bottle gets low!</li>
    <li> I would probably die if they ever stopped making this wonderful product.  A toner, but not drying. Smells fantastic!  Makes me feel like I&#x27;m in a spa.  Use the nettoyant cleanser, then spray the lotion on, add Creme PS and no more dry flaky skin.  You can spray on your face and spread with hands or spray on a cotton pad and wipe.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oner for over a decade and loved it. The bottle in the photo is what I have always used. This time, the design of the bottle was different and it leaks all over the place! It leaks standing up even if the spray function is locked!  I am hoping this is just a defective bottle and have messaged the seller requesting an exchange. I would not recommend this product at this time unless I can see that the bottle design change does work.  Too bad as  the product itself is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: contacted seller QskinZone: e-mail reply has blunt asking for a photo of the product (which is not the bottle you see on Amazon, but a new design) and asking why it took me 1 month to e-mail them. Well, some of us work 12-14 hours days and have kids to take care of when we get home, so e-mailing is a luxury! Honestly, I was hoping the bottle would stop leaking because it&#x27;s so difficult for me to find time to do personal e-mails. I would not buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> Yonka&#x27;s products are fantastic and rely on use of many natural plants. The smell is lovely. I&#x27;ve used both types of toners as well as the cleansing milk and several of the moisturizers. I have oily skin all my life and still have blemishes in my &#x27;50&#x27;s, but Yonka offers gentle but through cleansing. The only problem is the price! I have switched many of my products to the Avalon line (kids in college) but if money were no object, I&#x27;d be sticking with Yonka.</li>
    <li> Some things are worth the money.  This is one of those products.  I started using it in 1985 and I&#x27;ve tried others over the years, but none match the quality of Yonka.</li>
    <li> I usually use the normal skin formula.  The dry skin formula nourished my winter skin very nicely.  Actually, I notice no difference in either toner.  Yonka is an exceptional product!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 10 years now.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic if u have dry skin. Gentle and hydrates your skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m big on scents and this product does not do it for me. It has a stong rose and baby powder smell that is just terrible. The bottle it comes in is beautiful - it&#x27;s glass and quite heavy. I like the way it mists and how my skin looks after using it but I just can&#x27;t tolerate the scent. Because it was so expensive I will bite the bullet and finish the bottle but I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this toner, so much better than lotion!!!</li>
    <li> Divine feel and smell!</li>
    <li> This my second purchase. It is the best moisturizing toner I have found for my skin type which is mostly dry. One to two sprays after the shower, before moisturizer is my method. Sometimes I will add a third or fourth spray later in the day if the climate is very dry.</li>
    <li> this toner is so refreshing and I love the fragrance! Sometimes I spray it around in the air to give my bedroom a fresh smell.</li>
    <li> love this toner.  It has a wonderful smell and is a great PH balancer for my skin.  Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Best thing you can do for your skin after washing</li>
    <li> I Love Yonka products! I use many of them and they make my skin feel clean and healthy. I would suggest to anyone</li>
    <li> Maybe my favorite facial product ever.  I love this!  The scent, everything about it is refreshing and my skin feels so good.  The perfect product to spray on after cleansing.  Been using it a couple of years now and won&#x27;t stop any time soon.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve introduced by dermatologist. it&#x27;s very mild and make my skin brightly.&lt;br /&gt;I wanna change all cosmatics yonka!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll recommand it my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray for over 10 years.  I&#x27;m dissapointed that the bottle got smaller for the same price.  But this is a great product.  You spray it in the morning on your face and neck and it helps to wake you up and revives you.  Also a great quick moisturiser to be used morning and night.</li>
    <li> I came across Yonka during a spa weekend a few years ago and have been using their products almost exclusively ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a serious injury some months ago I was parked in a rehab facility with no chance to go home first so I had absolutely nothing - no clothes, not even my wedding ring. Getting things from home was a challenge as I had to accurately describe what what needed, what it looked like, and where I \\&quot;thought\\&quot; it would be found, then send my husband on a scavenger hunt after a 12 hour work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all this I could only bring myself to ask for one skin care product - so no contest. I opted for the toner as it can be applied after a shower or any time during the day and it leaves anyone&#x27;s skin glowing, fresh feeling, with no dry or pinched feeling. I started dabbing it under and over the eyes as well. It has a light, pleasant kind of lemon grass smell and just feels good to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I started using it, the staff began complimenting me on the improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance. They said I look fresh and clean and youthful. I brushed it all off completely as I was gravely ill and assumed the idea was to encourage. However, my husband not only noticed the same things but actually commented about them on his own volition. This guy is a hard care pragmatist so if he doesn&#x27;t think it he doesn&#x27;t say it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line- If stuck on a desert island with only one skin care item, clearly this would be it. I would not suffer from dry, pinched, uncomfortable skin, even if know one were around to appreciate the aesthetic improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Use this product every morning and especially every evening&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t do without this awesome product&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for years&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like a spa for your face - gorgeous soft rose water like scent -</li>
    <li> This is a nice toner.  It smells great and it is refreshing and not drying as most toners are.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> i lone this and i always use only this!!!</li>
    <li> I have always loved Yonka products...The toner is excellent for sensitive skin and smells heavenly. I especially like it during the summer when the humidity is overwhelming. Natural ingredients are appreciated.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. It is refreshing and relaxing to spray on any time of the day.</li>
    <li> Have been purchasing this lotion for years.  Love it!  Love the smell!  Just got my sister using it....</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it.  I don&#x27;t know what it is but it&#x27;s step one after washing my face morning and night.</li>
    <li> This lotion toner is light and refreshing and smells great. I have sensitive skin and its not irritating or greasy like some other products. My Mother&#x27;s Day gift to myself!!!</li>
