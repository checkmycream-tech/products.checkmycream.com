      <li>GREAT PRICE.THEY</li>
      <li>Nice buy!</li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>I  purchased these for gifts 4&amp;#34;  powder puffs cannot be found in stores unless you buy a box of powder;  I gave them all to family and friends, and everyone was pleased!</li>
      <li>This was a treasure to find and they are so nice to use.  </li>
      <li>They really do provide the best powder finish to makeup, as recommended by my favorite artist Wayne Goss.  </li>
      <li>I love the Velour Puffs.  </li>
      <li>; body powder pads you used to be able to buy OTC in any drugstore.  </li>
      <li>AND THEY CAME MORE THAN ONE IN A PACK,</li>
      <li>I was glad to see I was able to find it online as a replacement to my puff.</li>
      <li>I cut off the ribbon so that I can easily use both sides.</li>
      <li>I was finally able to locate them on Amazon (no small surprise) and I am thrilled with them.  </li>
      <li>Nice large puffs for dressing table use.</li>
      <li>Very soft and a nice size.</li>
      <li>This 10 pack for $25 is a good price because each pad is then only $2.50.  </li>
      <li>I wonder if I am the only one who likes to use a nice fine powder in the summer?</li>
      <li>I would even be interested in purchasing 5&amp;#34; powder puffs, if available.  </li>
      <li>Price was all right if you are looking for this.</li>
      <li>Nice other than that.</li>
      <li>if you are looking for Large make up puffs-</li>
      <li>I use the tiny ones I buy locally for my makeup bag, but these I use to do my makeup initially; they work beautifully.  </li>
      <li>So I would recommend them, but don&#x27;t expect them to be like the older &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34</li>
      <li>These puffs are decent.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why so few retailers carry them any more.</li>
      <li>Retail stores don&#x27;t carry powder puffs and some young clerks don&#x27;t know what you are talking about.  </li>
      <li>These were a bit smaller than I had thought based on the description and what I was looking to replace, and they don&#x27;t hold the powder as well as the older type.  </li>

<li> I really looked all over local stores, even specialty bath shops, and was not able to find these powder puffs.  </li>
<li> They are also big enough to apply some plain or shimmer powder to areas of the body.</li>
<li> I use them for loose powder.</li>
<li> Very soft and thick.</li>
<li> Powder puff meets all my wishes with the exception of being a little bit smaller than what I had wanted...</li>
<li> Just as I expected.  </li>
<li> but not good for body</li>
<li> Hard to find power puffs!  </li>
<li> It is impossible to find them in the stores.  </li>

    <li> Retail stores don&#x27;t carry powder puffs and some young clerks don&#x27;t know what you are talking about.  This was a treasure to find and they are so nice to use.  Keep making the powder puffs.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think they made thes any more--so thrilled to find them--love them!!</li>
    <li> I really looked all over local stores, even specialty bath shops, and was not able to find these powder puffs.  I was finally able to locate them on Amazon (no small surprise) and I am thrilled with them.  I wonder if I am the only one who likes to use a nice fine powder in the summer?</li>
    <li> Since they have stopped making powder puff powder containers with puff included in stores I was glad to see I was able to find it online as a replacement to my puff. I even got a multi-pack for future use. Excellent to apply powder anywhere.</li>
    <li> if you are looking for Large make up puffs- but not good for body powder-</li>
    <li> Wish they were about an inch bigger, but for the price &amp; quality, I can&#x27;t see paying $7-$10 for just one. Very soft and thick. Great stocking stuffer for your ladies.</li>
    <li> I love the Velour Puffs.  It is impossible to find them in the stores.  I have plenty to share with someone else!</li>
    <li> These are great, jumbo powder puffs!  Cheaper than name brands, but just as big.  This 10 pack for $25 is a good price because each pad is then only $2.50.  I couldn&#x27;t find these at the local Ulta, nor anywhere else.  They really do provide the best powder finish to makeup, as recommended by my favorite artist Wayne Goss.  I use the tiny ones I buy locally for my makeup bag, but these I use to do my makeup initially; they work beautifully.  They are also big enough to apply some plain or shimmer powder to areas of the body.</li>
    <li> These puffs are decent. I use them for loose powder. I would have rated them a 5 had they been thicker. I cut off the ribbon so that I can easily use both sides.</li>
    <li> THESE AREJUST WHAT I WANTED AND THEY CAME MORE THAN ONE IN A PACK, GREAT PRICE.THEY JUST&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T CARRY WHAT THEY USED TO IN THE STORES.</li>
    <li> These were a bit smaller than I had thought based on the description and what I was looking to replace, and they don&#x27;t hold the powder as well as the older type.  However, this product is the best I&#x27;ve been able to find in over a year!  So I would recommend them, but don&#x27;t expect them to be like the older &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; body powder pads you used to be able to buy OTC in any drugstore.  What happened to those anyway???</li>
    <li> Hard to find power puffs!  These are excellent and the price is excellent.</li>
    <li> I  purchased these for gifts 4&amp;#34;  powder puffs cannot be found in stores unless you buy a box of powder;  I gave them all to family and friends, and everyone was pleased! I would even be interested in purchasing 5&amp;#34; powder puffs, if available.  That  would be a PERFECT size.  Thank you, Mary Lane</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and a terribly good value!</li>
    <li> As advertised but next time I will get the smaller size.  The jumbos are too big for me.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected.  Very soft and a nice size.</li>
    <li> Powder puff meets all my wishes with the exception of being a little bit smaller than what I had wanted... Otherwise wonderful !</li>
    <li> Smaller than I realized. Nice other than that. It might last awhile. Price was all right if you are looking for this.</li>
    <li> Great quality!  Nice buy!</li>
    <li> Perfect for what we needed.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Nice large puffs for dressing table use. Good quality. I don&#x27;t understand why so few retailers carry them any more.</li>
