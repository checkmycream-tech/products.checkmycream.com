      <li>I was pleased with the purchase.</li>
      <li>I guess they thought that introducing a rotating blade would make it better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this razor for many years</li>
      <li>I am so glad there are still business that stock and supply them.  </li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
      <li>These razors are great and sold at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>After using them I almost didn&#x27;t buy this razor anymore, but had to remind myself that the real razor and refill cartridges were great and feel 10x better than the plastic disposables.</li>
      <li>I have used these razors for many years.</li>
      <li>I love the product.  </li>
      <li>This is a must have and surprisingly it gives me a very close, very smooth shave..almost no stubble.  </li>
      <li>perfect single blade for no nicks.</li>
      <li>Great razors for sensitive skin &amp; problems w/razor bumps &amp; ingrown hair.</li>

      <li>He won&#x27;t use any other blade and we get the best price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>My face is smooth and bump free on most spots.  </li>
      <li>If your skin is easily irritated by shaving, try theses razors.</li>
      <li>It may not shave a close as normal razors but this more than adequately gives you a good shave.</li>
      <li>These are the best blades I&#x27;ve found so far for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>but I am glad that I can obtain this item via Amazon.com at a economical price.  </li>
      <li>With Bump Fighter, I have seen an 80-90% decrease in my razor bumps, bleeding, and pain experienced while shaving daily.</li>
      <li>but they are cheap</li>
      <li>These are good razors for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for stocking this product and being able to buy this in bulk.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon for being able to get them.</li>
      <li>Reasonably close shave; too close would probably bring more ingrowns.  </li>
      <li>You see, if you have curly hair and shave super close, the hair will sometimes start to curl before it re-emerges through the skin, causing irritation.</li>
      <li>You can shave quickly without having to worry about nicks and cuts.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon, I and many others ... will be able to still purchase,  Bump Fighter Razors Blades from a company who do not care if a  particular product is, \\&quot; MADE FOR A SPECIFIC ETHIC GROUP \\&quot; who selling practices is unbiased towards a one world community of LOVE!</li>
      <li>was very pleasant compared to the cheap disposables I get at Costco, but my feeling is that the shave may not be as long lasting.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>Only razor I can use for the last many years that gives me a good shave and doesn&#x27;t scrape my skin.</li>
      <li>Simple and effective.</li>
      <li>It works to reduce bumps, but the shave isn&#x27;t as close as I truly like, but the reduction in bumps is worth it.</li>
      <li>Definitely better for sensitive skin than then multiblade razors, but still not 100% relief.  </li>
      <li>You look good with a nice shave and a huge reduction in bumps, ingrown whiskers, and nicks--and I have pretty heavy, full facial hair pattern.</li>
      <li>The skin around my mouth gets red and irritated and ingrown hairs very easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the closest shave possible, but it is very comfortable</li>
      <li>great buy hard to find.</li>
      <li>These razors work pretty well.  </li>
      <li>The product is an excellent product that keeps bumps from appearing on African American Men that have to shave daily.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this razor since it first came on the market in the 1970s.</li>
      <li>Thank goodness they did hot change the cartridges.  </li>
      <li>Give it a shot, after all, it is very cheap to acquire and try and will save you loads of money in the long haul.</li>
      <li>These razors are the best thing for my skin and thick facial hair texture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Bump Fighters for over 25 years and they certainly improved my razor bump condition I was suffering ftom.</li>
      <li>The end result is not baby bottom smooth, but it&#x27;s close enough and you avoid the razor bumps.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>These are the only razors I feel comfortable using.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
      <li>Razor really helps with razor burn/bumps.</li>
      <li>These blades won&#x27;t give you the closest shave on earth by the hand test (you can feel tiny, tiny stubble with your hands) but visually you get a good clean shave and certainly by today&#x27;s relaxed business office standards for facial hair, it&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for those who suffer like I do with razor bumps, regardless of race.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great products. I have been using for a couple of years now with no issues.</li>
    <li> These razors are a great product</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the purchase. Price was significantly less than the stores i normally buy from. I would recommend this product. I will continue to purchase my blades from amazon</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and am very happy with its performance.  It is hard to find anything that competes in this space for providing  a close shave while preventing razor bumps.</li>
    <li> I love the product, but I recommend against buying it from these sellers. Although I paid for six refill cartridges, I only received three. The phone number provided is never attended, and nobody responds to my emails.</li>
    <li> My hubby swears by these.  We have boxes of them and he has enviable, gorgeous razor bump free skin.</li>
    <li> great buy hard to find.</li>
    <li> My husband has to use these razors and the disposable variety just don&#x27;t perform as well. We were very happy to be able to find these because you cannot find refill cartridges in a retail store. Service was prompt. Price was good.</li>
    <li> They were just what I needed</li>
    <li> My girlfriend likes these a lot because the blades are not set to cut too close and she gets a nice shave on her legs without nicks and abrasions.  I tried them on my beard and the shave was very pleasant compared to the cheap disposables I get at Costco, but my feeling is that the shave may not be as long lasting.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bump Fighter products for years. They have never let me down.</li>
    <li> I have used these razors for many years. Almost never a nick or cut. The downside is that the shave is not always close. So I use this razor for more sensitive areas and a Gillette Fusion for other areas. Gives me the optimal shave.</li>
    <li> The cartridges are great, its the handles that are substandard.</li>
    <li> With these razor blades, my husband is able to easily shave his head every day, and keep it smooth.  With traditional blades, he was always missing spots and nicking himself, but this technology allows him to shave closely and safely.</li>
    <li> Great razors that will leave your face smooth and bump free!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Bump Fighter razors if you have sensitive skin and want to avoid the unsightly razor bumps.</li>
    <li> At first I was doubtful but hopeful.  After using the razor, I am now upset that I didn&#x27;t know about it BEFORE I used other razors..This is a must have and surprisingly it gives me a very close, very smooth shave..almost no stubble.  I&#x27;d even recommend it for women wanting to shave the bikini area.</li>
    <li> AT ... 1/18/2014 ... Bump Fighter Razors Blades can not be purchase at any Walmart Stores - which was the only ones that I knew who carried them.  I bought a 6 pack of refill Cartridges on ... August 20, 2012 ... from Amazon and just ran out today. Thanks to Amazon, I and many others ... will be able to still purchase,  Bump Fighter Razors Blades from a company who do not care if a  particular product is, \\&quot; MADE FOR A SPECIFIC ETHIC GROUP \\&quot; who selling practices is unbiased towards a one world community of LOVE! I speak for ALL when I say --thank you, AMAZON! And, may you continue to GROW by outsourcing a  ... NEW WORLD ORDER ... whose WEALTH is build upon -- the BLOOD and SWEAT of the DOWNTRODDEN that is practice -- by CORPORATE GREED!</li>
    <li> Got so tired of being cut too many times with the other razors.I am miffed that this is not available at Walmart or Kmart,not even the disposal razors.I would buy again and again.The razor blades are designed to lessen razor bumps,common among Black men.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by these. He&#x27;s tried the newest razors and keeps returning to these. Simple and effective.</li>
    <li> Simply works / shaves clean above skin surface.</li>
    <li> This helped cut down in my husband&#x27;s razor burn.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s standby. He won&#x27;t use any other blade and we get the best price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I was 22 years old.  I can&#x27;t imagine shaving without them.  They have become so hard to find in the brick and mortar stores.  I am so glad there are still business that stock and supply them.  Price is great.  My face is smooth and bump free on most spots.  I love this product and have  loved it for 30 plus years.</li>
    <li> Definitely better for sensitive skin than then multiblade razors, but still not 100% relief.  Each can be used only once at peak sharpness, so not a cheap indulgence by any means.  The cartridge is not very open in the back, so cut hair and foam gets caught inside, which requires occasional cleaning during shaving and is rather annoying.  There is no reason why it couldn&#x27;t open in the back so a simple rinse would take care of the problem.</li>
    <li> Great product that I&#x27;ve been using for years</li>
    <li> I have used bump fighter blades for over 20 years and the stores near me no longer carry them.  I am thrilled that I can get them on Amazon.  These are the only blades that I can use due to my ingrown hair problem. Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> These are the best (period). Since I&#x27;ve been using these my ingrown hair issues has greatly subsided. For me I can only shave with a razor about 3 times per week. The other time I dry shave with my Andi T Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I must note that I also use Tend Skin, so that also helps in preventing ingrown hairs. With that duo you can&#x27;t go wrong. Now, you must know this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Do not buy the disposable plastic version of this razor. It feels horrible!!! It&#x27;s almost as if the ends of the plastic scratch your face as you shave and it&#x27;s very uncomfortable. After using them I almost didn&#x27;t buy this razor anymore, but had to remind myself that the real razor and refill cartridges were great and feel 10x better than the plastic disposables.</li>
    <li> It is the only razor that I use but for some reason, the cartridges don&#x27;t slide on easily with the actual razor. I purchased 5 of these and am not sure what happened.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor since it first came on the market in the 1970s. I have never had an issue with razor bumps using this razor.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  The guard on the razor may cause you to go over the same spot twice, but it helps keep you from getting razor bumps.</li>
    <li> Ever since my brother in law told me about this 3  years ago I have been using it with great satisfaction.  If you&#x27;re African American you need this.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on bump patrol and other creams.  The secret is in the fact that these blades don&#x27;t cut too close to the skin so that your hair doesn&#x27;t curve back into the skin to cause bumps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades on my sensitive, uneven, and stubbly face for about 30 years. They&#x27;re designed to give a reasonably close shave to men who might suffer pseudofolliculitis (infections or raised blemishes of the whisker follicles from shaving, ie; shaving bumps) from facial hair shaved too closely, below the skin, by those expensive multi-blade shaving cartridges. These slightly elevated single blades not only prevent future shaving bumps, but also will glide over most existing bumps without nicks and bleeding, which continues the cycle of shaving bumps. These blades won&#x27;t give you the closest shave on earth by the hand test (you can feel tiny, tiny stubble with your hands) but visually you get a good clean shave and certainly by today&#x27;s relaxed business office standards for facial hair, it&#x27;s a no brainer. You look good with a nice shave and a huge reduction in bumps, ingrown whiskers, and nicks--and I have pretty heavy, full facial hair pattern. They are hard to find in stores anymore, so I buy them in bulk online and save $$. If you suffer shaving bumps and ingrown whiskers, or maybe have difficult to shave acne scars, these blades are great. I hope they never stop making these, I&#x27;ll be in trouble.</li>
    <li> I have used these blades for years. They single handled stopped my razor bumps. I used to use shaving power prior to trying these blades. I started using them several years ago. Thanks to Amazon for being able to get them. They do a great job.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find in any store. These razors are great and sold at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Work well, long lasting and economical, thanks.</li>
    <li> This product met all of my expectations.</li>
    <li> I was using a 5-blade razor that gave me the closest shave that I had ever experienced. It felt great! But then razor bumps started to form and I didn&#x27;t know why. When talking to my brother about it, he told me it was because I was shaving too close. Then he turned me on to the Bump Fighter razor. You see, if you have curly hair and shave super close, the hair will sometimes start to curl before it re-emerges through the skin, causing irritation. The Bump Fighter is designed to shave the hair above the skin only. So after switching to this razor, the bumps went away and I&#x27;ve been using it every since.</li>
    <li> Been using for years, won&#x27;t even think of trying another brand. No reason to change when this works like it does.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,, will purchase more</li>
    <li> Great product? Amazon was only one with them in stock.</li>
    <li> perfect single blade for no nicks.</li>
    <li> Continue to love these blades.  Stop all bumps and burn that the 3 to 5 blade close-shave razors cause.</li>
    <li> I live in a small town that doesn&#x27;t the refill packs - this will last a while - thank you.</li>
    <li> Use these all the time. Keep me from getting razor bumps.</li>
    <li> Great razors for sensitive skin &amp; problems w/razor bumps &amp; ingrown hair. I use it on my face &amp; head</li>
    <li> These are the only razors my husband will use. He has sensitive skin but with these razors he gets few shaving bumps. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It works to reduce bumps, but the shave isn&#x27;t as close as I truly like, but the reduction in bumps is worth it.</li>
    <li> Great razors at a great price. I used to suffer from very large and unsightly razor bumps from having to shave on a daily basis due to my current career. With Bump Fighter, I have seen an 80-90% decrease in my razor bumps, bleeding, and pain experienced while shaving daily. I have been using Bump Fighter for almost two years now. They are MUCH cheaper than razors such as Gillette Fusion razors that only cut up my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is marketed primarily for African-Americans; however, I am white and just have very curly facial hair. I highly recommend it for those who suffer like I do with razor bumps, regardless of race. Give it a shot, after all, it is very cheap to acquire and try and will save you loads of money in the long haul.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND It.  This is especially the case if you have sensitive skin or just like to pamper and/or do less damage to your skin than other razor.  By the way - the &amp;#34;Refill&amp;#34; version of the Bump Fighter is the way to go because the razor has a heavy and balanced feel to it as opposed to the standard feel of a disposable razor.</li>
    <li> If your skin is easily irritated by shaving, try theses razors. They were recommended to me by a dermatologist. No more razor bumps!</li>
    <li> I have been using bump fighter for seven years now.  I do not plan to change my selection at all.</li>
    <li> I use these blades every other shave, as my other blade, which has five blades, while giving a very close shave, sometimes irritates my face. These blades enable me to shave the next day without increasing irritation.</li>
    <li> I had been struggling with ingrown hairs for some time.  A friend recommended these to me. I have extremely sensitive skin and the thought of using a razor would break my face out.  I still can&#x27;t use this on my face but this is a great razor for my chest and stomach.  I am resolved to dry shaving with clippers on my face.</li>
    <li> Very very pleased! !!</li>
    <li> Only razor I can use for the last many years that gives me a good shave and doesn&#x27;t scrape my skin.</li>
    <li> Product was recieved as ordered. Razor really helps with razor burn/bumps.Would recommend this product to anyone who gets frequent razorburn issues.</li>
    <li> I like the Bump Fighter because I get much less skin irritation with it. It&#x27;s not the closest shave possible, but it is very comfortable</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for many years and it&#x27;s growing harder to find this product at the big box retailers.  Thanks Amazon for stocking this product and being able to buy this in bulk.  This a a great product for any man no matter their ethnic background who suffers from ingrown hairs, sensitive skin or other skin related issues.  It may not shave a close as normal razors but this more than adequately gives you a good shave.</li>
    <li> Bump Fighter has been around a long time.  However, I think they must have been acquired a few years back because they changed the style of their disposable razors. I guess they thought that introducing a rotating blade would make it better.  Unfortunately, it was a terrible decision because it defeated the whole purpose by making the shave too close.  Thank goodness they did hot change the cartridges.  The cartridges are the same as they&#x27;ve always been. You can shave quickly without having to worry about nicks and cuts.  The end result is not baby bottom smooth, but it&#x27;s close enough and you avoid the razor bumps.</li>
    <li> These razors work pretty well.  If you are expecting the closest shave you have ever received then you need to look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a shave what is pretty close with less irritation then look no further.  Yes I said LESS irritation not NO irritation.  I suffer from razor bumps and I still get them from shaving, just not as bad with this razor.  I still use a fusion razor for the areas of my face that does not get irritation, like my mustache and goatee area.  For my neck and my cheeks, I use the Bump Fighter razors.  That&#x27;s until I&#x27;m done with my electrolysis treatments.</li>
    <li> Always happy with the product.  Good price.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The shipping was on point and the price was excellent. Thank you!</li>
    <li> ...my dermatologist recommend these blades 30 years ago  have been using since</li>
    <li> These are good razors for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It did the job I expected.</li>
    <li> These are the only razors I feel comfortable using. I can shave a lot quicker with these than other razors without worrying about nicks and razor bumps. I&#x27;ve used them for several years, trying other razors and always coming back to these. I hope they never stop making these babies, I&#x27;ll have to grow a beard.</li>
    <li> Razors were what I want will order again</li>
    <li> Highly recommended from a long time user! Best prices shipped to my door via Amazon. No more &amp;#34;wild goose chases&amp;#34; looking for them-only razor and refills I use!</li>
    <li> It works for me!  It does just what it says. I get razor bumps with most blades, not with this one.</li>
    <li> I have used bump fighter cartridges for about 9 years now.  In fact it is the only razor I will use for shaving.  With other razors I&#x27;ve dealt with severe razor rash and bumps and while I still deal with a few minor bumps, it&#x27;s nothing like before.  The results are excellent and I can&#x27;t tell much difference between these razors and others in terms of closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for those who have sensitive skin or deal with razor rash or bumps.</li>
    <li> These razors are the best thing for my skin and thick facial hair texture. I&#x27;m glad I found them.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this product.  He has sensitive skin and these razors are perfect.  He does not have those unsightly bumps when shaving with bump fighter!</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used Bump Fighters for over 25 years and they certainly improved my razor bump condition I was suffering ftom.</li>
    <li> I am white male, 34. The skin around my mouth gets red and irritated and ingrown hairs very easily. These are the best blades I&#x27;ve found so far for sensitive skin. Only complaint is that they rust after a week or so. Having only one blade they wear out fast but they are cheap so that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
    <li> Love it, great price, great service</li>
    <li> Started using these several months ago after fighting ingrown hairs for quite a while.  Reasonably close shave; too close would probably bring more ingrowns.  Works best if I change the blades very frequently.</li>
    <li> My husband will only use these blades.  He has less bumps from hairs growing back into his skin.  His shaves last longer.</li>
    <li> thanks so very much for having these hard to find gems here. they are indeed a blessing and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> My husband has had good luck with these razor blades. He used to have problems with irritation and ingrown hairs... not anymore!</li>
    <li> These razor like nobody&#x27;s business</li>
    <li> I have used these razors for many years. I can say that since I started using these, I have not had issue with pseudo.</li>
    <li> One of the few places I can find this product any more is on Amazon. Prices are still the same as they were in the store. I also like I can buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> These are very good cartridges, much better than the disposable. They are good for about 3 uses and then you will need to change if you have real coarse hair</li>
    <li> Caucasian male here. These blades work great for my neck. It&#x27;s usually a problem area for bumps and irritation, but these blades minimize all that. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I love the product.  It is unfortunate that the local stores no longer carry the product but I am glad that I can obtain this item via Amazon.com at a economical price.  The product is an excellent product that keeps bumps from appearing on African American Men that have to shave daily.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a product which has worked well for me for several years.Since using it I have had no ingrown hair problems.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised. Thanks</li>
    <li> This work great for me!</li>
    <li> The best way to shave and not have to worry about being cut and at the same time get a close shave.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses these because he has sensitive skin that has bumps after he shaves. This is actually very affordable and works great.</li>
    <li> This product has been in use in our household for over ten (10) years.  It is the only shaving product that gives us the results we need.  Thank you Bump Fighter!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have a problem with razor bumps.  These are the only razors that I use.  I have used the bump fighter blades for 35 years and nothing else.</li>
    <li> The price increase has me looking for an alternative site for this product. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Use these Razors all the time to avoid Razor Burns and Bumps and I also Recommend this Razor to my Friends and Family !</li>
