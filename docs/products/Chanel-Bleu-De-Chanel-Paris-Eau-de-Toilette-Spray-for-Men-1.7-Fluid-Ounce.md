      <li>it&#x27;s strong),</li>
      <li>Thanks Perfume leader you have another satisfied customer!</li>
      <li>Love this cologne, probably my new favorite.</li>
      <li>product was in original packaging.  </li>
      <li>Euphoria (Very romantic, intimate cologne, great for love making, but</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick, exterior packaging seemed genuine.</li>
      <li>I love Bleu so much that I just bought a 3.4oz bottle from Chanels website for $84.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn Usher (this is my daily cologne and will still use this), Unforgivable (wicked good, but boy</li>
      <li>I ordered a bottle of the Bleu from this vendor and it wasn&#x27;t even close to being like a true bottle of Chanel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fellas, if you looking for THAT cologne that will draw a woman closer to you and spark a conversation, then look no further (of course it doesn&#x27;t help to be good looking too, lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
      <li>Women get ready you won&#x27;t be able to control yourself</li>
      <li>Sure it can seem a bit mainstream, but it is very versatile and any age can where it.</li>
      <li>After receiving a sample in a magazine (usually not the most reliable), I ordered a bottle, primarily because it was produced by the Chanel line.  </li>
      <li>Chanel has some amazing products , but in the past, I haven&#x27;t been terribly impressed with their male fragrances.</li>
      <li>I really like that this has a fresh, cleaner and lighter smell than most Chanel products.</li>
      <li>I bought this product 3 months ago, and ever since I have had nothing but compliments from both sexes, women more particularly.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t wore cologne since I was in high school, but ever since I bought this I have had more success with the ladies...let me tell you.</li>
      <li>but this is my new favorite</li>
      <li>Woman really seem to enjoy this one.</li>
      <li>It was worth it for me because I do not care to go to department stores.</li>
      <li>it was worth a shot.  </li>
      <li>make the right choice.</li>
      <li>The initial aroma was fine however it dissipated very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I bought my older one at Macy&#x27;s and the one before that at Duty free.</li>
      <li>I had sampled it in a department store and instantly fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>it is a long lasting and distinct smell the everyone will notice (in a good way of course).</li>
      <li>This on the other hand smelt diluted and had a very strong nail-polish remover like smell.</li>
      <li>it is too much for the cost.</li>
      <li>Beware this is not the real thing.</li>
      <li>Let me get straight to the point with this fragrance.</li>
      <li>so I could have gotten the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; at FreeZone stores at airport.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue</li>
      <li>but yes, all of the above are true...</li>
      <li>Upon opening it i realized that it smelt nothing like my older bottle of Chanel Bleu.</li>
      <li>its very powerful, however, you can bathe in Usher and it just seems to not linger very long....</li>
      <li>I was highly disapointed to wear it though.</li>
      <li>I got this as a Christmas gift and in little over 24hrs, I have had so many compliments.</li>
      <li>was surprised how much he had to spray to even smell it.</li>
      <li>If you look in the right places, you can definitely find it for about sub-$60 (1.7oz).</li>
      <li>The opening is fresh and wild, the mid is also wonderful, but the base can sometimes feel a bit synthetic.</li>
      <li>Like every other Chanel cologne I own it&#x27;s high quality stuff that last a long time.</li>
      <li>I have used Chanel Bleu in the past and I know what it smells like, but the product I received was not anywhere near the quality of a Chanel product, From the packaging, to the spraying tip on the top of the bottle and of course the SMELL....was bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>money back would be highly appreciated at this point</li>
      <li>I checked with Amazon and was pleasantly surprised that I could place an order and receive shorlt afterwards.  </li>
      <li>Not even close to the real Chanel bleu  bottle and box is different.</li>
      <li>I can truly say you get your money&#x27;s worth with Chanel, and that&#x27;s not necessarily the case with other brands.</li>
      <li>I have received numerous compliments and highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to wear something a little different!</li>
      <li>But after a few steps I ran into the store and picked one up the smell is addictive as smelling FRESH PATROL</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fresh citrus cologne with an expensive, elegant dry down.</li>

<li> I bought the trial size due to the price of the product and the fact that I was completely unfamiliar with the scent.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s long lasting too.</li>
<li> It would have been worth the money if the aroma lasted, but at this price you can buy two other colognes that have a chance at lasting at least an hour or two.</li>
<li> The trial size is more expensive than other trial fragrances.</li>
<li> The other Chanel colognes go for similar prices -</li>
<li> I would recommend just going down to a department store and buying it, you may spend a few extra dollars but WONT have to deal with the hassle of getting a product you don&#x27;t WANT!</li>
<li> I could spray every other hour and fragance would not even stay on clothing like the \\&quot;$150+\\&quot; priced product you get at Macy&#x27;s or other department stores.</li>
<li> oh whatever its just like any other perfume ...</li>
<li> Allure Homme, Plaitinum Egoiste and Egoiste are $2 less per bottle.</li>
<li> I myself have been wearing this fragrance for a few months and have made this one of my signature scents.</li>
<li> when I heard a voice from behind me...\\&quot;excuse me, what&#x27;s that your wearing?\\</li>
<li> This scent has been receiving criticism from the fragrance world, but I don&#x27;t really see what you can hate about it.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t always tell my secret though on what I&#x27;m wearing</li>
<li> In a few days I received tons of complements and my wife loves it!!!!</li>
<li> I purchased this cologne and although I felt that it was expensive</li>
<li> I am really disappointed with this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Usher (this is my daily cologne and will still use this), Unforgivable (wicked good, but boy it&#x27;s strong), Euphoria (Very romantic, intimate cologne, great for love making, but it reminds me of cotton candy...don&#x27;t know why) and now BLEU...well, I&#x27;ve danced with 5 women (all at the same time!) and then with 3 on another occasion, so I kinda know what&#x27;s up when it comes to women...I just ignore them! Drives them nuts! Well, now, I don&#x27;t have to do ANYTHING, just wear BLEU!...I was propositioned last night, simply for wearing this cologne.....still shaking my head over this one.  This is the end of my review....don&#x27;t have to say one more word...do I?  I&#x27;m not trying to brag,.....who am I bragging 2 anyway....but yes, all of the above are true...100%.  I&#x27;ve never lied....doesn&#x27;t do anyone any good, so why do it in the first place...your gonna get caught anyway.  But I did want to write a review on this, as it&#x27;s about as good as it gets when it comes to cologne...I&#x27;ve never had a fragrance, that just drives women off the chain.  Oh, Was in the grocery store, standing in line. when I heard a voice from behind me...\\&quot;excuse me, what&#x27;s that your wearing?\\&quot;  I told, and then she proceeded to tell her girlfriend, it was a very interesting to be complimented like this.  I absolutely love this stuff, and you don&#x27;t have to wear alot...its very powerful, however, you can bathe in Usher and it just seems to not linger very long....ok...I&#x27;ve said enough...oh, if you don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll buy it. I&#x27;ll watch reviews and if someone posts that they don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll do everything I can to get it off your hands.</li>
    <li> I love Chanel Bleu De Chanel cologne. It&#x27;s a fresh citrus cologne with an expensive, elegant dry down. Like every other Chanel cologne I own it&#x27;s high quality stuff that last a long time. I own Allure Homme, Allure Homme Sport, Platinum Egoiste and Egoiste. I can truly say you get your money&#x27;s worth with Chanel, and that&#x27;s not necessarily the case with other brands. I love Bleu so much that I just bought a 3.4oz bottle from Chanels website for $84. The 1.7oz bottle is sold for $62 and the 5oz goes for $115. The other Chanel colognes go for similar prices - Allure Homme, Plaitinum Egoiste and Egoiste are $2 less per bottle. They can be had for the same prices at Macys - plus tax of course. Don&#x27;t buy any of the Chanels listed here. It&#x27;s a ripoff.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 3 months ago, and ever since I have had nothing but compliments from both sexes, women more particularly. I have lots of girlfriends, and girl friends and all of them rave and relish on how great I smell all the time. They always want to lean in closer for a better smell. Even family member and my bros ask what that wonderful fragrance is! But its the ladies guys...this is the cologne to get. I haven&#x27;t wore cologne since I was in high school, but ever since I bought this I have had more success with the ladies...let me tell you. I don&#x27;t always tell my secret though on what I&#x27;m wearing so I tell people the \\&quot;redneck\\&quot; way of saying the name of the cologne, Blue D. Channel...lol! But yes, this is the Cream of the crop...or I should say Creme dela Creme! Just buy it now!</li>
    <li> After receiving a sample in a magazine (usually not the most reliable), I ordered a bottle, primarily because it was produced by the Chanel line.  I tried ordering it through another web site, but they were sold out.  I checked with Amazon and was pleasantly surprised that I could place an order and receive shorlt afterwards.  Upon receipt, I tried the spray and loved it!  I have received numerous compliments and highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to wear something a little different!</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick.  product was in original packaging.  bought for christmas present and was immediately used when opened.  The smell was wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne, probably my new favorite. I have Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue but this is my new favorite</li>
    <li> Excelete PRODUCT AND THAT USED TO BUY IT. I RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> Gentlemen, let me just say: I got this as a Christmas gift and in little over 24hrs, I have had so many compliments. One spray is all it takes! One of my favorite colognes ever!!</li>
    <li> I bought the trial size due to the price of the product and the fact that I was completely unfamiliar with the scent. It is the best smelling fragrance I have ever tried. In a few days I received tons of complements and my wife loves it!!!! I will buy the bigger bottle on my next Amazon order. The trial size is more expensive than other trial fragrances. It cost about $12 for the tiny vial. It was worth it for me because I do not care to go to department stores.</li>
    <li> It was truly great.  The fragrance is out of this world.  Women get ready you won&#x27;t be able to control yourself</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne and although I felt that it was expensive it was worth a shot.  The initial aroma was fine however it dissipated very quickly.  It would have been worth the money if the aroma lasted, but at this price you can buy two other colognes that have a chance at lasting at least an hour or two.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick, exterior packaging seemed genuine. Upon opening it i realized that it smelt nothing like my older bottle of Chanel Bleu. I bought my older one at Macy&#x27;s and the one before that at Duty free. Both smelt identical, and wonderful. This on the other hand smelt diluted and had a very strong nail-polish remover like smell. I am really disappointed with this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good parfum indeed. It is one of the best men parfums I&#x27;ve ever felt. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Chanel has some amazing products , but in the past, I haven&#x27;t been terribly impressed with their male fragrances. That was, until I tried Bleu. I had sampled it in a department store and instantly fell in love with it. I really like that this has a fresh, cleaner and lighter smell than most Chanel products. It&#x27;s long lasting too. The notes will linger on for a while and captivate from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fellas, if you looking for THAT cologne that will draw a woman closer to you and spark a conversation, then look no further (of course it doesn&#x27;t help to be good looking too, lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep this cologne in handy in your arsenal fragrances for courting and conquests :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shopping!</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this \\&quot;deal\\&quot;. I was highly disapointed to wear it though. I could spray every other hour and fragance would not even stay on clothing like the \\&quot;$150+\\&quot; priced product you get at Macy&#x27;s or other department stores. I wish I could have waited when I am traveling internationally so I could have gotten the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; at FreeZone stores at airport.&lt;br /&gt;My money back would be highly appreciated at this point but I am doubting I could get it since I started wearing this cologne this weekend, opposed to wearing it as soon as I got it over a month ago.</li>
    <li> My husband tested the scent in a magazine and loved it! When we ordered it and he put some on he was surprised how much he had to spray to even smell it. The scent is pleasant but doesn&#x27;t seem to stick.  Having to spray 5-10 times to even smell it is too much for the cost.</li>
    <li> What a rip off they charge me over a 100 dollars for the 1.7 oz when on macys its 62 dollars . &amp; 110 dollars for the 5. Oz  guess everyone has to make a profit. Lesson learned</li>
    <li> The best of Chanel for Men, the finest for the men that loves the best, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it</li>
    <li> Not even close to the real Chanel bleu  bottle and box is different. Beware this is not the real thing.</li>
    <li> It was truly great the fragrance is very nice and women get ready you won&#x27;t be able to control yourself</li>
    <li> I ordered a bottle of the Bleu from this vendor and it wasn&#x27;t even close to being like a true bottle of Chanel. I have used Chanel Bleu in the past and I know what it smells like, but the product I received was not anywhere near the quality of a Chanel product, From the packaging, to the spraying tip on the top of the bottle and of course the SMELL....was bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the REAL Chanel Bleu is a great smelling cologne. it is a long lasting and distinct smell the everyone will notice (in a good way of course). I would recommend just going down to a department store and buying it, you may spend a few extra dollars but WONT have to deal with the hassle of getting a product you don&#x27;t WANT! hope this helps some of you guys make the right choice.</li>
    <li> Let me get straight to the point with this fragrance. This fragrance is a compliment magnet! I myself have been wearing this fragrance for a few months and have made this one of my signature scents. This scent has been receiving criticism from the fragrance world, but I don&#x27;t really see what you can hate about it. The opening is fresh and wild, the mid is also wonderful, but the base can sometimes feel a bit synthetic. I can somewhat see how people can criticize this fragrance, but to be completely honest, there is nothing like it out there. Sure it can seem a bit mainstream, but it is very versatile and any age can where it. This scent can last up to 10-12 hrs on my skin and it is a beast for longevity. If you have the money definitely buy this fragrance. If you look in the right places, you can definitely find it for about sub-$60 (1.7oz).</li>
    <li> Great cologne I get complements all the time with this. Woman really seem to enjoy this one. I&#x27;ll be sure to buy again when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> NO I&#x27;M KIDDIN !    This is literally the best perfume I ever smelled !    Some salesman sprayed it on my hands in a mall I smelled it and said to myself oh whatever its just like any other perfume ... But after a few steps I ran into the store and picked one up the smell is addictive as smelling FRESH PATROL</li>
    <li> Perfume leader is an awesome company to purchase from. I bought this for my husband for his birthday and really am satisfied with my purchase. My man smells excellent when he wears this cologne. The seller sent my product in a timely manner, it was in a sufficient container and I would buy from them again. Thanks Perfume leader you have another satisfied customer!</li>
