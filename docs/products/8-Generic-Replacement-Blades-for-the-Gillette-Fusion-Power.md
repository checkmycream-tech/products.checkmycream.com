      <li>We have tried other razors but this is the best!</li>
      <li>The blade unit is slightly lighter in color than the Gillette Fusion Power blades and the case they come in does not say &amp;#34;POWER&amp;#34;; otherwise they seem to work perfectly.  </li>
      <li>It shaved through my 4 day growth of beard quickly and cleanly and felt very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Great generic version for my fusion.  </li>
      <li>but it looks genuine.</li>
      <li>They cost about two thirds of what Gillette blades normally retail for and give the same excellent shave.</li>
      <li>They are as good as the brand name only cheaper.</li>
      <li>No difference from real blades except the price!</li>
      <li>- they say generic but they sure seem to be the real deal.  </li>
      <li>A very cool generic product that does the job.</li>
      <li>Blades work fine, will order again in the future when I run out.</li>
      <li>They really don&#x27;t look or feel like generics -</li>
      <li>Feels like the real thing.</li>
      <li>These look just like the real thing</li>
      <li>but you get very close shave</li>
      <li>I believe these are genuine Gillette blades packaged for the foreign market.</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, these are the genuine blades at nearly half the price.</li>
      <li>Good price not sure that they are as sharp as sore products</li>
      <li>Package came on time, for being Generic, they looked like the real deal.</li>
      <li>even the package is exactly the same as what I bought in store last week.  </li>
      <li>Tried this for the first time...and working out extremely well...</li>

<li> These blades are from Europe and they are not as long lasting as the U.S.A. versions they ware out faster, thinner blades, it&#x27;s on their site,</li>
<li> Im not sure if the blades were actual FUSION - the color of the blade differs from &amp;#34;store purchased&amp;#34;</li>
<li> I can usually get at least 60 shaves out of a Fusion blade</li>
<li> and you can hardly tell them apart from the Gillette Fusion Power blades..  </li>

    <li> A very cool generic product that does the job. No complaints here.</li>

    <li> Good price not sure that they are as sharp as sore products</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter who has a lot of hair on her arms and legs. She loves the ease of use and how well it works. We have tried other razors but this is the best!</li>
    <li> Great blades and great price, thank you.</li>
    <li> Great generic version for my fusion.  Every bit as good as the original Gillette blades.</li>
    <li> bought them for my father he loves the shaver but the blades are big bucks in the store,Amazon is the only place to go if you want a deal.it keeps my fathers face happy and when he&#x27;s happy so is the rest of the family.</li>
    <li> Great deal - they say generic but they sure seem to be the real deal.  I like them a lot and will continue to reorder them &amp; cancel my dollar shave club subscription.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell that they are generic. Feels like the real thing. Nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Got mine earlier than estimated shipping.  They really don&#x27;t look or feel like generics - even the package is exactly the same as what I bought in store last week.  Definitely ordering again.</li>

    <li> Good quality, and good price.</li>
    <li> very good , i use one blade for more shave</li>
    <li> They are as good as the brand name only cheaper.</li>
    <li> I got an 8 pack of blades today. I put a cartridge on my Gillette Fusion power razor and switched it on. It shaved through my 4 day growth of beard quickly and cleanly and felt very comfortable. I believe these are genuine Gillette blades packaged for the foreign market. I would definitely buy them again from this seller. They cost about two thirds of what Gillette blades normally retail for and give the same excellent shave.</li>
    <li> Best Blades for the $</li>
    <li> Good product, good price fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Product is as described and it got here on time.</li>
    <li> These look just like the real thing and you can hardly tell them apart from the Gillette Fusion Power blades..  The blade unit is slightly lighter in color than the Gillette Fusion Power blades and the case they come in does not say &amp;#34;POWER&amp;#34;; otherwise they seem to work perfectly.  I can usually get at least 60 shaves out of a Fusion blade so I am putting these to a test.</li>
    <li> Package came on time, for being Generic, they looked like the real deal. Blades work fine, will order again in the future when I run out. Great price, great deal.</li>
    <li> I been buying from Amazon  over 3 years now  every one says I have nice beard when it gows out I shave every 4 days  or once a week because I am not working  but you get very close shave</li>
