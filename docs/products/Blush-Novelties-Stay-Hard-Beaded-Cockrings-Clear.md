      <li>Save your money, there are better products out there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use a cock ring before.</li>
      <li>cheap product!</li>
      <li>Flexible but not too flexible for easy use.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean and use.</li>
      <li>Looks like they&#x27;ll work fine according to my husband - was happy to get new ones - lost the old ones.</li>
      <li>Lol&lt;br /&gt;Defiantly would recommend trying these for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#x27;re worried about the fit like I was.. The smallest right can stretch 4inches in diameter no problem.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s good, my friend&#x27;s husband loves it for those long runs.</li>
      <li>pretty good, doesn&#x27;t keep erection after completion but does appear to help in increasing the standard of erection and hardness, recommended</li>

      <li>the bigger the better</li>
      <li>These did absolutely nothing to correct my roosters posture!  </li>
      <li>Soft silicone rings, not much compression and snaps very easy</li>
      <li>However, since my radiation treatment for prostate cancer, I gradually developed ED issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cheap and really didn&#x27;t do anything if you are thick or big</li>
      <li>Probably the only downside is that being transparent and small, they&#x27;re easy to misplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the money however.</li>
      <li>Should be at least a snug fit &amp; it isn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I have only tried two of the three sizes so far.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t suspect they would last long with frequent use--but you never know.</li>

    <li> I guess it&#x27;s good, my friend&#x27;s husband loves it for those long runs. Can&#x27;t mess up with these things unless you put them on too tight I believe.</li>
    <li> pretty good, doesn&#x27;t keep erection after completion but does appear to help in increasing the standard of erection and hardness, recommended</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected. They arrived in small zip lock bag and had a strange substance on them. Almost as if they were used or something. I tossed them right in the trash.</li>
    <li> nubs are uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> If you are losing a little lead in your pencil give a cock ring a try. These cock rings work well. Flexible but not too flexible for easy use. Instead of the blue pill give these cock rings a try. Worth it.</li>
    <li> Way too flimsy to be of any good. Should be at least a snug fit &amp; it isn&#x27;t. Save your money, there are better products out there.</li>
    <li> So affordable and handy! Very nice to have these on hand in case you want to take it up a notch. Easy to clean and use.</li>
    <li> these are great  kept me fuller and from a climax alot longer</li>
    <li> They work as advertized.</li>
    <li> Looks like they&#x27;ll work fine according to my husband - was happy to get new ones - lost the old ones.</li>
    <li> keeps it up works for me and I am 57 feels like I am 20 again get some and get to it .</li>
    <li> great product  performs well</li>
    <li> These did absolutely nothing to correct my roosters posture!  Completely useless! My cocks are as limp and as lifeless as ever. The hens  just laugh and laugh. Not worth the 20 minute struggle trying to get these around their thick, vein necks!</li>
    <li> Soft silicone rings, not much compression and snaps very easy</li>
    <li> some thing was wrong with them</li>
    <li> Love these rings make my penis very hard and huge love it and so do my partner he loves it... the bigger the better</li>
    <li> good does what its suppose to do</li>
    <li> Cheap and really didn&#x27;t do anything if you are thick or big</li>
    <li> Yes. Just yes lol&lt;br /&gt;Me and my girl tried em out and they make you a bit bigger and last longer and when the time comes... SO much better! Lol&lt;br /&gt;Defiantly would recommend trying these for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#x27;re worried about the fit like I was.. The smallest right can stretch 4inches in diameter no problem.</li>
    <li> These cock rings seem to be made of fairly soft silicon rubber and can be applied easily with very little discomfort - not super tight. The inside diameter of these rings hovers around 14/16th of an inch(give or take 1/16th).  The largest ring is the thickest, followed by the middle ring.  The last ring seems to be the lightest in thickness. I don&#x27;t suspect they would last long with frequent use--but you never know. This item&#x27;s useability is limited.</li>
    <li> 4 stars for packaging</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use a cock ring before. However, since my radiation treatment for prostate cancer, I gradually developed ED issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is so simple and easy to take on and off and is amazingly comfortable. I have only tried two of the three sizes so far. Probably the only downside is that being transparent and small, they&#x27;re easy to misplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the money however. I will likely purchase again as needed. By the way you get three packages in one purchase so it may be awhile before I need to purchase again.</li>
    <li> cheap product! Does not do anything that a cock ring should. Waste of money!</li>
