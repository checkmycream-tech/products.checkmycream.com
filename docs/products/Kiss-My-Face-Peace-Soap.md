      <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, really great soap for really reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Love this-</li>
      <li>But this has more of a sweet-mint smell, almost like spearmint.</li>
      <li>A portion of the proceeds go to make the world a better place.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure how \\&quot;grassy mint\\&quot; was going to smell, but oh boy, I just love this.</li>
      <li>I bought this Castile soap looking for something nice and mild to bathe my son with.</li>

      <li>It has a fresh, clean scent and gets a good lather.</li>

      <li>It is soft and moisturizing,  as well as a great scent.</li>
      <li>All in all, it smells good, feels good, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>got 2 bottles because I loved the original soap so much.</li>
      <li>The smell is lovely... sweet minty grass.</li>
      <li>It does a good job getting him clean without stripping all the natural oils like most shampoos.</li>
      <li>I have primarily used this soap in the shower and as hand soap.</li>
      <li>I use it as a shampoo and as a body wash and really enjoy how it smells and the way it makes my skin and hair feel.</li>
      <li>We love all of the scents that this soap comes in, and our closet shelf is stuffed with many bottles of this soap because the whole family adores it.</li>
      <li>The unique scents are fun and interesting.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty safe in terms of chemicals</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m familiar with how Castile soap is supposed to lather, and this soap just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Dr. Bronner&#x27;s mint castile soap before and it was much more intensely minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used to use this soap last year, and loved the scent, lots of leather, and the texture.</li>
      <li>The smell is mediocre at best, unless you love the smell of spearmint gum.</li>
      <li>The original soap had a traditional Castille soap texture- liquid, with lots of suds, clean rinsing, with a lovely fresh scent.</li>
      <li>As some others commented, the aroma is very much like that of spearmint gum - minty sweet.  </li>
      <li>Wish it lathered more, but then it probably wouldn&#x27;t be all natural.</li>
      <li>The various scents that this brand is available in are really nice because they are natural and not petroleum-based (which causes perfume headaches in those of us with allergies).  </li>
      <li>If there is any hardened soap on there you might want to try to remove it first</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelmingly minty, just nice and light.</li>
      <li>I wanted to find a good natural soap that I could order through the \\&quot;subscribe &amp; save\\&quot; program on Amazon and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s (my usual choice) wasn&#x27;t available</li>
      <li>this soap has a completely different feel and texture from the original one, it was most likely reformulated.</li>
      <li>Because it is Castile soap, the soap thickens and hardens fast when exposed to air.</li>
      <li>Really like this soap.  </li>
      <li>It is a rather watery soap, but it does lather very well.</li>
      <li>I only wish they had a bigger size to use as a refill, since I have my own soap dispensers.</li>
      <li>The soap is so soft, and leaves my hands clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>The really enjoy the scent of the soap, it is a mild mint that lingers on my hands for a little while after washing.</li>
      <li>I am going back to the tried and true Dr Bronnner Peppermint soap.</li>
      <li>It feels less harsh than the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint I used to use, on a daily basis that&#x27;s a good thing for me, but if you like the strong menthol smell and tingly feeling of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s you may not like this one as much.  </li>
      <li>I really like these soaps, they&#x27;re natural and not harmful to the environment.</li>
      <li>I want to try the other scents available, too.</li>
      <li>Once it was clear I reattached it and the soap has been going through with no trouble ever since ( about a month).</li>
      <li>not very strong but strong enough to feel awkward.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this soap,  I use it in a foaming dispenser,  a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>This soap has a thicker texture of a shower gel and barely any foam.</li>
      <li>I will admit his hair doesn&#x27;t look quite so squeaky-clean as with regular baby shampoo, but that&#x27;s because regular shampoos strip all the natural oils from the hair, whereas this one doesn&#x27;t.   </li>
      <li>Highly recommended as a replacement for any less natural soap.</li>
      <li>I think it really helps with taking care of black heads on my face, since I noticed them clearing up after I started using this soap</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this soap,  I use it in a foaming dispenser,  a little goes a long way.  It is soft and moisturizing,  as well as a great scent.</li>
    <li> Really good soap. But shipping package comes in the shape different from advertised picture. The picture has bottle cap. The shipment came with pump. Pump is weak and broken. Leaking contents within the package. Nevertheless, really great soap for really reasonable price. The soap also smells great. Shipping came with reasonable protection, but the pump made everything weak. A bottle cap for shipment and pump on the side for usage would have made it perfect. But Too late now.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not one for liquid soaps in the shower, I adore this one&#x27;s fragrance and feel. The smell is lovely... sweet minty grass. The lather is light and isn&#x27;t over abundant. All in all, it smells good, feels good, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> The Peace soaps are the best! I have a bottle next to every sink. So nice to use an effective product that you can feel good about the ingredients. They smell great too.</li>
    <li> Having a sensitivity to aloe, which is in virtually all products these days, I am thrilled to find this soap.  The various scents that this brand is available in are really nice because they are natural and not petroleum-based (which causes perfume headaches in those of us with allergies).  We love all of the scents that this soap comes in, and our closet shelf is stuffed with many bottles of this soap because the whole family adores it.</li>
    <li> Love this- it has a great scent.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell and feel.  The soap is so soft, and leaves my hands clean and soft.  The smell is amazing.  I will continue to buy this.  I buy it with the 15% subscribe and save discount.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, love that there is no chemicals or toxic antibacterial agents.</li>
    <li> As some others commented, the aroma is very much like that of spearmint gum - minty sweet.  But I like it - and find it eye opening which is what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> It smells good, cleans well, and it&#x27;s very highly rated on the EWG site.  Highly recommended as a replacement for any less natural soap.</li>
    <li> Really like this soap.  I think it&#x27;s pretty safe in terms of chemicals and it smells nice and lathers well.</li>
    <li> I really like these soaps, they&#x27;re natural and not harmful to the environment. I would just go with a different scent next time, this one smells like toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I bought this Castile soap looking for something nice and mild to bathe my son with. Wasn&#x27;t sure how \\&quot;grassy mint\\&quot; was going to smell, but oh boy, I just love this. Even my son likes the smell, he will sniff appreciatively when I start to apply it to him. It reminds me of what Celestial Seasoning&#x27;s Tension Tamer tea smells like. Very minty, with a hint of herb-y green tea scent.   It does a good job getting him clean without stripping all the natural oils like most shampoos. I will admit his hair doesn&#x27;t look quite so squeaky-clean as with regular baby shampoo, but that&#x27;s because regular shampoos strip all the natural oils from the hair, whereas this one doesn&#x27;t.   I&#x27;ve even used it on my own hair with great results. I can&#x27;t resist the smell, sort of a \\&quot;Calgon, take me away\\&quot; moment in the shower.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find a good natural soap that I could order through the \\&quot;subscribe &amp; save\\&quot; program on Amazon and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s (my usual choice) wasn&#x27;t available so I gave this a try.  I&#x27;ve since gone through 2 bottles of it and am loving it.  It&#x27;s a nice, gentle soap with a pleasant minty smell - not overpowering, not chemical-ly.  It feels less harsh than the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint I used to use, on a daily basis that&#x27;s a good thing for me, but if you like the strong menthol smell and tingly feeling of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s you may not like this one as much.  This is an excellent daily wash soap at a great price.</li>
    <li> The really enjoy the scent of the soap, it is a mild mint that lingers on my hands for a little while after washing. It cleans well and I like that it has a short ingredient list. When I received the item, the pump did not work. To solve this issue, I took the pump off and pumped warm water through it. Once it was clear I reattached it and the soap has been going through with no trouble ever since ( about a month).</li>
    <li> My family and I absolutely love this soap and the smell is fantastic! It lathers well and your hands feel really clean afterwards with a nice light minty smell. Because it is Castile soap, the soap thickens and hardens fast when exposed to air. Therefore be careful when pushing on the pump. If there is any hardened soap on there you might want to try to remove it first or else you end up with soap flying across the room!</li>
    <li> I only wish they had a bigger size to use as a refill, since I have my own soap dispensers.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and just get Dr Bronner&#x27;s. This stuff is terrible. The smell is mediocre at best, unless you love the smell of spearmint gum. I&#x27;m familiar with how Castile soap is supposed to lather, and this soap just doesn&#x27;t. Weak.</li>
    <li> I used to use this soap last year, and loved the scent, lots of leather, and the texture. The bottle used to look like the one in the picture, but the bottle that I received was with a pump and a different label. This product has the same name, but there are a few problems.&lt;br /&gt;1) Amazon did a horrible job packaging this bottle. It arrived in  just a plastic wrap in a bigger box with my other items. The pump unscrewed in transit, and some soap spilled out inside the plastic bag. I noticed that some reviewers complained about the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;2) this soap has a completely different feel and texture from the original one, it was most likely reformulated. The original soap had a traditional Castille soap texture- liquid, with lots of suds, clean rinsing, with a lovely fresh scent. This soap has a thicker texture of a shower gel and barely any foam. I put some on a shower puff, and after vigorously squeezing it to work up a leather, I got enough for 1 leg. It feels very different as well, sticky or tacky after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;3) the scent is not as strong.&lt;br /&gt;I got 2 bottles because I loved the original soap so much. I am going back to the tried and true Dr Bronnner Peppermint soap.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. The unique scents are fun and interesting. The soap itself does not contain &#x27;controversial&#x27; ingredients. A portion of the proceeds go to make the world a better place. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I have primarily used this soap in the shower and as hand soap. It is a rather watery soap, but it does lather very well. It works great in foaming hand soap dispensers. I use it as a shampoo and as a body wash and really enjoy how it smells and the way it makes my skin and hair feel. I think it really helps with taking care of black heads on my face, since I noticed them clearing up after I started using this soap and that was the only change I&#x27;ve made. I think it&#x27;s probably due to castile soap removing dirt, but not over-drying the skin and stripping away oil. But your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t smell quite like I would have guessed. I like candles and air fresheners that have that sweet/fresh-cut grass scent. But this has more of a sweet-mint smell, almost like spearmint. It&#x27;s not overwhelmingly minty, just nice and light. I&#x27;ve tried Dr. Bronner&#x27;s mint castile soap before and it was much more intensely minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I want to try the other scents available, too.</li>
    <li> Wish it lathered more, but then it probably wouldn&#x27;t be all natural. Love the smell!!!</li>
    <li> everytime I wash my hands with this I feel like I&#x27;m rubbing minty gum around my hands. It smells like mint. not very strong but strong enough to feel awkward.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why but this scent is different than lemongrass scent. This soap doesn&#x27;t wash well. I tried to wash dishes with this and it leaves all the oily feeling to the dish and doesn&#x27;t wash at all.&lt;br /&gt;I tried washing my hair with this, same thing.</li>
    <li> I like the soap and will purchase it again.  It has a fresh, clean scent and gets a good lather.</li>
