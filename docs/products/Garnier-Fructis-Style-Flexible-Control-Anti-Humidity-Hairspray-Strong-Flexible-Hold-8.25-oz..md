      <li>Hold great!</li>
      <li>A perfect strength that doesn&#x27;t leave the hair looking greasy.  </li>
      <li>ALL OF THE FRUCTIS HAIR PRODUCTS ARE GREAT!</li>
      <li>Very good packaging.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>I received this hairspray as a gift and it is amazing!</li>
      <li>It leaves a good amount of gunk, but will not hold a curl even in the slightest.</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>Light to medium hold, great smell!</li>
      <li>Excellent price and well worth the it.</li>
      <li>This stuff is cheaper and better!</li>
      <li>But, that&#x27;s ok - my hair doesn&#x27;t move!</li>
      <li>it is truly amazing it does stiffen your hair or crunch your hair or leave that sticky residue PLUS it.</li>
      <li>This hair spray smells delicious which is probably why I love it so much.</li>
      <li>Hands-down, this Garnier Flexible Control spray is the best middle-ground I&#x27;ve ever found: the spray goes on light and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling crunchy, yet it keeps it under good control (and the \\&quot;anti-humidity\\&quot; claim is absolutely true: this spray keeps my curls from frizzing even in the height of super-muggy New England summers).</li>
      <li>However it is also really strong and keeps your hair looking amazing.</li>
      <li>Wife&#x27;s favorite.</li>
      <li>You will really be pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Love the way it controls my hair.</li>
      <li>Garnier smell :)</li>
      <li>However, for the price, I think I will give this some more try.</li>
      <li>While the gel can be used for styling without an iron, this hair spray keeps hair styles in shape for more the 24 hours.  </li>
      <li>and I love the free shipping.</li>
      <li>Works in asian in the very high humidity summary and the best thing is cheap.</li>
      <li>Holds curls perfectly and doesn&#x27;t dry to fast</li>
      <li>Works as well for my super fine hair in humid conditions</li>
      <li>its not my favorite really, but i would use this again.</li>
      <li>Another quick spray when my hair is styled as I want it,</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Application wise follow the directions the trigger is easy to use even at odd angles.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go -- all day long!</li>
      <li>I oredered it because I saw so many good reviews of it and saw a few videos on YouTube using it after curling with an iron... didnt work for me!  </li>
      <li>i do enjoy the way it smells and the hold is strong and soft but it made my hair frail and brittle</li>
      <li>Fresh material.</li>
      <li>This spray come out in great application and does not feel stiff.  </li>
      <li>The right amount of hold without any build up or hardness.</li>
      <li>Not the right product for me.</li>
      <li>The hold is not too crisp</li>
      <li>In fact the hair looked even better the next day.  </li>
      <li>as much higher priced salon sprays.  </li>
      <li>And if I want a bit of curl to my hair, I spray it lightly first, then use the curling iron.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad that I&#x27;ve found this on Amazon - it&#x27;s definitely a product I will continue to use.</li>
      <li>I love that this hairspray is strong enough to hold my style through a long work day yet brushes right out when my day is over.</li>
      <li>No weighing down my hair or sticky feeling with a nice hold.</li>
      <li>Would definetly recommend to anyone looking for a product with a light hold and mess free.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>This product really works.  </li>
      <li>I highly suggest buying this product!</li>
      <li>This hair spray provides absolutely zero hold.</li>
      <li>it does the job well even when only lightly sprayed on hair.  </li>
      <li>This really holds and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>But it really stiffens up and started to tear / snag my hair.</li>
      <li>Very touchable feel.</li>
      <li>It also has a pleasant, fruity scent, and it&#x27;s very affordable -- especially compared to higher-priced salon sprays that don&#x27;t work half as well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t often use hairspray since I only curl my hair when it&#x27;s special occasions, but I think for me this product doesn&#x27;t hold really well.</li>
      <li>Decent price on Amazon</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>After spraying, you can easily make adjustments, but after it is set it holds hair in place very well without being stiff.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry too quickly, so you can mold your hair</li>
      <li>If you curl your hair obviously it will drop a bit throughout the day but only to a very pretty length.</li>
      <li>I really love the smell, and it is not like the other product, it is not sticky but it can hold the shape for a long time, almost a day&amp;#62;</li>
      <li>My hair is really fine, so I can&#x27;t use a hard hairspray.  </li>
      <li>I have fairly thick but fine hair.</li>
      <li>Sprays at high volume and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I have very thick, very curly hair, so I blow it straight after every wash and then use this hairspray to keep humidity damage at bay.  </li>

    <li> This hair spray provides absolutely zero hold. It leaves a good amount of gunk, but will not hold a curl even in the slightest. It also makes my hair really staticky, which is annoying because there is no fixing it until I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I received this hairspray as a gift and it is amazing! Not only does it NOT produce stiff locks of hair, it HOLDS your hair for the entire day!! It doesn&#x27;t dry too quickly, so you can mold your hair however you want. And, having used this during a Chicago summer, I can testify that this hairspray truly does work against humidity! I have never used a hairspray quite like this one. I am so glad that I&#x27;ve found this on Amazon - it&#x27;s definitely a product I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Works as well for my super fine hair in humid conditions as much higher priced salon sprays.  Decent price on Amazon and I love the free shipping.</li>
    <li> Nowhere is it mentioned that it&#x27;s strength is 2 out of 5 !! too small in the picture !&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t accept return .&lt;br /&gt;disappointed.&lt;br /&gt; it does nothing to your hair.</li>
    <li> I love that this hairspray is strong enough to hold my style through a long work day yet brushes right out when my day is over. No more helmet head.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and the humidity is crazy. I used this product before but have in the recent years been buying more expensive hairsprays. This stuff is cheaper and better! No weighing down my hair or sticky feeling with a nice hold.</li>
    <li> THis hairspray is flexible but holds well.  After spraying, you can easily make adjustments, but after it is set it holds hair in place very well without being stiff.</li>
    <li> I dont know if mi hair is hard to tame, but my naturally straight hair wont curly even using this. I oredered it because I saw so many good reviews of it and saw a few videos on YouTube using it after curling with an iron... didnt work for me!  it just stays like 1 hour (being hopefull).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but may be its just for my hair, may be i should buy a harder formula</li>
    <li> Love the way it controls my hair. And if I want a bit of curl to my hair, I spray it lightly first, then use the curling iron.  This way my curls last and last and last!  Another quick spray when my hair is styled as I want it, and I&#x27;m good to go -- all day long!</li>
    <li> I do not like stiff hair.  This spray come out in great application and does not feel stiff.  Hold great!</li>
    <li> I really love the smell, and it is not like the other product, it is not sticky but it can hold the shape for a long time, almost a day&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often use hairspray since I only curl my hair when it&#x27;s special occasions, but I think for me this product doesn&#x27;t hold really well. I guess if you want a nature wavy look, then you may want to try this. However, for the price, I think I will give this some more try. Plus I like Garnier smell :)</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Works great. Holds my bun in place for 13hour shifts. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Light to medium hold, great smell! Holds the curls without leaving the hair hard. Very touchable feel.</li>
    <li> A perfect strength that doesn&#x27;t leave the hair looking greasy.  Sprays at high volume and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Product was as described. Not sticky and messy and holds just how I like it! Would definetly recommend to anyone looking for a product with a light hold and mess free.</li>
    <li> I have fairly thick but fine hair. This really holds and you don&#x27;t need much. But it really stiffens up and started to tear / snag my hair. Not the right product for me.</li>
    <li> My hair is really fine, so I can&#x27;t use a hard hairspray.  This spray is perfect for me.  The right amount of hold without any build up or hardness.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is horrible! It sprays unevenly with large droplets that clump up hair, it leaves hair stiff but does not hold style particularly well. The smell is what you&#x27;d  expect from Garnier - tropical and fruity. Would not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> ALL OF THE FRUCTIS HAIR PRODUCTS ARE GREAT!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this item it is truly amazing it does stiffen your hair or crunch your hair or leave that sticky residue PLUS it. Holds curls perfectly and doesn&#x27;t dry to fast so you have time to shape it</li>
    <li> Ordered this hair spray along with a curling iron and a hair spray gel.  While the gel can be used for styling without an iron, this hair spray keeps hair styles in shape for more the 24 hours.  In fact the hair looked even better the next day.  The hold is not too crisp so it doesn&#x27;t get uncomfortable and it does the job well even when only lightly sprayed on hair.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, very curly hair, so I blow it straight after every wash and then use this hairspray to keep humidity damage at bay.  This product really works.  You will really be pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite. Arrived quickly. Very good packaging. Fresh material. No dents in spray cans. Excellent price and well worth the it.</li>
    <li> This hair spray smells delicious which is probably why I love it so much. However it is also really strong and keeps your hair looking amazing. If you curl your hair obviously it will drop a bit throughout the day but only to a very pretty length. I highly suggest buying this product!</li>
    <li> This product does hold at two my curls were not crunchy and I have none of that sticky feeling. Application wise follow the directions the trigger is easy to use even at odd angles.</li>
    <li> its not my favorite really, but i would use this again. i do enjoy the way it smells and the hold is strong and soft but it made my hair frail and brittle</li>
    <li> The nozzle works!  Some from a store don&#x27;t.  It says flexible hold, but it isn&#x27;t.  But, that&#x27;s ok - my hair doesn&#x27;t move!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, very curly hair, and over the years I&#x27;ve tried countless hairsprays to help keep my mop under control. My problem with sprays was always that they either didn&#x27;t provide enough hold or else they made my hair stiff as a helmet. Hands-down, this Garnier Flexible Control spray is the best middle-ground I&#x27;ve ever found: the spray goes on light and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling crunchy, yet it keeps it under good control (and the \\&quot;anti-humidity\\&quot; claim is absolutely true: this spray keeps my curls from frizzing even in the height of super-muggy New England summers). It also has a pleasant, fruity scent, and it&#x27;s very affordable -- especially compared to higher-priced salon sprays that don&#x27;t work half as well. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I like it. Works in asian in the very high humidity summary and the best thing is cheap.</li>
