      <li>The darkest shade isn&#x27;t what if looks like in the picture, I know I should have even smarter than that, but if only it was it would have been perfect.</li>
      <li>this is OK.</li>
      <li>but over all i love it</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t completely in love with it</li>
      <li>The coverage is not that great for a concealer and its a very oily/greasy palette.  </li>
      <li>Will order more.</li>
      <li>With that said, you may need to apply more often.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I have no idea how to do my own makeup, so I thought I&#x27;d buy this and try it, since it&#x27;s so cheap and all.</li>
      <li>Love love this makeup it took a while</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Thank u :)</li>
      <li>Ok, not as pigmented as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>and i ran out of my favorite color within a week</li>
      <li>exellent ii Love it :) &amp;</li>
      <li>I Love This Product</li>
      <li>Could be better though...</li>
      <li>Okay for beginners.</li>
      <li>lil more moist</li>
      <li>I Really love this palette</li>
      <li>and I was okay</li>
      <li>I thought that this concealer palette would be better then what the price is for.  </li>
      <li>It just so nice a clean and goes on so smooth !</li>
      <li>and they do really cover!!!!</li>
      <li>Some of them have a caked on look, but it works pretty good.</li>
      <li>It feels nice and smooth on and its really fin to play with! :)</li>
      <li>Otherwise,  It&#x27;s easy to blend with, but softer and stickier than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Other wise its good</li>
      <li>The compact is nice in size and colors are exactly as shown.</li>
      <li>But for practice this is fine.</li>
      <li>Its just cheaply made and it doesnt cover anything.</li>
      <li>This concealer is a very good quality,i received it this morning and the pallete overall is pretty and well put together</li>
      <li>But overall, loved product.</li>
      <li>Loved it soo much already ordered a second one :)</li>
      <li>but I was hoping for full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm</li>
      <li>My advice is to go around and search for some other generics with better reviews, because there are some good ones out there, this however, unfortunately is not one.</li>
      <li>even if it&#x27;s a penny I should get my money&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>I just love this concealer so much it come so fast to me</li>
      <li>but it was worth it</li>
      <li>today I was so excited to open it and use it when I see it&#x27;s all  mostly melted.</li>
      <li>I really like the colors in this, they aren&#x27;t super orangy.</li>
      <li>but i do really like it!</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>this again is exactly as pictured the colors</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used all of the palettes yet but the few I have used work pretty good.</li>
      <li>I literally can&#x27;t think of anything positive to say about this stuff.</li>
      <li>The cream blushes are positively horrid.</li>
      <li>the darkest shade is a lot lighter and more grey.</li>
      <li>Liked the variety of tones and use of dark colors for contouring.</li>
      <li>I really did not like the colors for my skin.</li>
      <li>save your money and buy the real thing somewhere else.</li>
      <li>it really isn&#x27;t...</li>
      <li>so you really gotta blend it out and then finish your contouring with a bronzer.</li>
      <li>I searched it and it&#x27;s really oily.</li>
      <li>I gave it to my daughter at Christmas along with some makeup brushes and she seemed to really like it.</li>
      <li>they aren&#x27;t very pigmented at all and did not blend well.</li>
      <li>but then I realized I can barely fit my larger concealer brush in the pots.</li>
      <li>I was very please with the colors and they weren&#x27;t oily at all.</li>
      <li>Very prompt and helpful.</li>
      <li>it came very quicky way before the estimate arrvial day.</li>
      <li>but the price says it all really</li>
      <li>Go ahead and spend the money on real concealers.</li>
      <li>but it really works out.</li>
      <li>Not for a real outing.</li>
      <li>Also like I said it&#x27;s really oily and it will break my skin out.  </li>
      <li>I mostly use it to cover dark circles under my eyes and so far its doing it&#x27;s job!</li>
      <li>Seems like the ones you play with as a little girl, more like lipgloss</li>
      <li>and she really likes the set because it did not irritate her normally sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised by this 15 color makeup.</li>
      <li>A little small but great.</li>
      <li>The actual palette itself is really nice, the cover is solid matte black, looks very professional.</li>
      <li>Definitely does not do a brand name products job, but it&#x27;s okay for daily use, just not parties or long days.</li>
      <li>but these concealers esspecially the brown and darker colors has an purple under tone and i highly recomend you use these specific concealers for high lighting and conturing</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
      <li>Super oily, it did not cover up my dark circles or acne, and it made me break out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> gift to my friend and she loved it!!</li>
    <li> Love this. It&#x27;s not cakey at all. And if you run out of your shade you can always mix colors!</li>
    <li> eh the darker colors look nothing like that in person. the darkest shade is a lot lighter and more grey. they aren&#x27;t very pigmented at all and did not blend well. can&#x27;t even tell its on my face. the lighter colors where a little better but not worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Loved it soo much already ordered a second one :)</li>
    <li> I was dispointed when i got it. I thought it was big but came it be smaller than i thought. Other wise its good</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have no idea how to do my own makeup, so I thought I&#x27;d buy this and try it, since it&#x27;s so cheap and all. Well from what I can tell it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a year I USE to highlight my eyebrows also can&#x27;t help but to use it every time I go out especially church</li>
    <li> Super oily, it did not cover up my dark circles or acne, and it made me break out.</li>
    <li> Liked the variety of tones and use of dark colors for contouring.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s oily and not the best concealer.  Seems like the ones you play with as a little girl, more like lipgloss</li>
    <li> Wow. I bought this stuff hoping that it&#x27;d be a decent generic for the Coastal Scents concealer palette. I was so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying the lighter colors do not match what is in the pan when you swirl your finger into them/apply them on your face. The lightest three colors, in particular, all look the same as far as undertone and color, they were just a really pale ivory, and even I (with the fairest of skintones) found it to be way too light. The highlighter was just a clear gloss with glitter in it, and the lavender and green color correctors were wayyy too light and couldn&#x27;t be covered by the other skin toned concealers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a joke as well. This is the greasiest makeup product I&#x27;ve ever felt. No amount of setting powder can fix it. I wouldn&#x27;t even mind if it was a little bit dewy, but because of the oiliness of the concealers even with setting powder on, they slide around like crazy and go into every little line and pore. And I&#x27;m only 20 years old, I didn&#x27;t know I even had some of these eye wrinkles until I used this product, hahah. The color pay off is meh, it&#x27;s a medium coverage, which is alright I guess, but I was hoping for full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm. I literally can&#x27;t think of anything positive to say about this stuff. My advice is to go around and search for some other generics with better reviews, because there are some good ones out there, this however, unfortunately is not one.</li>
    <li> Definitely does not do a brand name products job, but it&#x27;s okay for daily use, just not parties or long days.</li>
    <li> Perfect coverage, super buildable, and great for contouring. Great buy!!&lt;br /&gt;I also have pretty acne prone skin and this definitely did not break me out.</li>
    <li> I recieved this because I wanted it. I just got it in the mail today and the black case it&#x27;s in is broken.  I searched it and it&#x27;s really oily.</li>
    <li> I thought the size of this palette is great but then I realized I can barely fit my larger concealer brush in the pots. The actual palette itself is really nice, the cover is solid matte black, looks very professional. The darkest shade isn&#x27;t what if looks like in the picture, I know I should have even smarter than that, but if only it was it would have been perfect. In the picture it looks like a dark chocolate but it it really isn&#x27;t... It has a orangey tone when you put it on so you really gotta blend it out and then finish your contouring with a bronzer. Otherwise,  It&#x27;s easy to blend with, but softer and stickier than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> The makeup looked to greasy for me.  I gave it to my daughter at Christmas along with some makeup brushes and she seemed to really like it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good pallete without spending so much money, this is the best option for you. Arrived on time, good packaging. 100% recommended!</li>
    <li> Gor this today....Love It!!! Will order more.</li>
    <li> This concealer is a very good quality,i received it this morning and the pallete overall is pretty and well put together but these concealers esspecially the brown and darker colors has an purple under tone and i highly recomend you use these specific concealers for high lighting and conturing</li>
    <li> Love love this makeup it took a while but it was worth it</li>
    <li> I really like the colors in this, they aren&#x27;t super orangy. It is allot smaller than i expected and i ran out of my favorite color within a week but i do really like it! It feels nice and smooth on and its really fin to play with! :)</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this, I got it in the mail today I was so excited to open it and use it when I see it&#x27;s all  mostly melted. I was angry because I was looking forward to using this for myself and for customers. It&#x27;s not much money but that&#x27;s besides the point even if it&#x27;s a penny I should get my money&#x27;s worth this is ridiculous. I contacted the seller so hopefully I can be reimbursed or it can be replaced. When buying BEAWARE I wanted to like this product but I got pure melted crap smh!!!</li>
    <li> This was going to be a great pallete for my daughter but it wasnt anything like concealer. Its just cheaply made and it doesnt cover anything. Dont buy it, dont waste your money, go buy a real product!</li>
    <li> First the palette came broken and it&#x27;s really oily. I&#x27;m going to use it just for eyeshadow instead of on my face because it&#x27;s really hard to spread out. It gets stuck on my brush... Also like I said it&#x27;s really oily and it will break my skin out.  The colors are nice and they show up well on my skin when used as an eyeshadow. Could be better though...</li>
    <li> I Love This Product it&#x27;s exellent ii Love it :) &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;I will Purchase Again an i think the price was pretty good too ! Thank u :)</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a coworker. She is a avid make-up user, but does try to keep the cost to a minimal. I was told the colors were as expected and she really likes the set because it did not irritate her normally sensitive skin. Keep in mind, you get what you pay for it. With that said, you may need to apply more often.</li>
    <li> i have had coastal scents concealer palette before and it was wonderful this is OK. It looks ashy when i put it on and very messy. save your money and buy the real thing somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Some of them have a caked on look, but it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> I bought this and I was okay but I wasn&#x27;t completely in love with it I thought it was a bit too oily for my taste but I use it every so often.</li>
    <li> Awful product, wish I got my money back. It was too greasy &amp; there was NO coverage. Do not waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> THIS SET IS AWESOME! YOU WOULDNT BELEIVE IT FOR THIS PRICE. THIS IS A STEAL!</li>
    <li> I just love this concealer so much it come so fast to me i was happy get it. It just so nice a clean and goes on so smooth !</li>
    <li> Okay for beginners. Go ahead and spend the money on real concealers. But for practice this is fine. Not for a real outing.</li>
    <li> I really love these concealer colors! the only thing i dont like is the box they came in. it looks kinda tacky! but over all i love it and they do really cover!!!!</li>
    <li> I really did not like the colors for my skin. The colors were a little lighter then i anticipated that it would be. Great customer service for sellers though. Very prompt and helpful.</li>
    <li> The cream blushes are positively horrid. First of all they are so hard to even get onto the brush. Next when applying them to your face, when you try and blend them out, it is disastrous and not only do they not blend, they do not look natural. They end up looking fake and cakey. If this product wasn&#x27;t from all the way in china, I would have returned it. I just threw it out, it was horrible.</li>
    <li> its really hard to blend out but the price says it all really</li>
    <li> so I received this way earlier than I thought.  this again is exactly as pictured the colors are really nice.  now I can watch my makeup tutorials on youtube and figure out how to use these, im excited because they are great</li>
    <li> I mostly use it to cover dark circles under my eyes and so far its doing it&#x27;s job! I recommend it 😊</li>
    <li> I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lil more moist but it does the job</li>
    <li> Bought for granddaughter.  She really loved it!!  Great item.  It has a lot of variety of shades so it should work for just about anyone and for any area of the face.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of the palettes yet but the few I have used work pretty good. It is a little on the creamy side but it really works out.</li>
    <li> Great palette! Great for contouring and good texture on the skin.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised by this 15 color makeup. The reviews were not very accurate description of the product. I was very please with the colors and they weren&#x27;t oily at all. The compact is nice in size and colors are exactly as shown. Will order again and recommend this product for my clients. I loved playing with the pastels it did wonders to illuminate my face. Shipment was US mail it took a week. But overall, loved product.</li>
    <li> Ok, not as pigmented as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> A little small but great.</li>
    <li> I have no experience with concealer but this is great for beginners! The &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; looks pink, I don&#x27;t use it at all, the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; is a little bluish but did remove the redness. Some of the skin tones are a little blush looking. Its really hard to find the right color for me. Mixing color&#x27;s won&#x27;t help. And hard to wash of brushes.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I thought that this concealer palette would be better then what the price is for.  I was highly disappointed after multiple uses.  The coverage is not that great for a concealer and its a very oily/greasy palette.  Doesn&#x27;t give good consistency at all.</li>
    <li> I Really love this palette it came very quicky way before the estimate arrvial day. I wasnt even expecting this untill another week</li>
