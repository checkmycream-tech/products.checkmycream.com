### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best wishes figuring out how to use this item.</li>
      <li>divide storage area is excellent.</li>
      <li>As advertised, works great</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>This pill crusher/cutter works great for me.</li>
      <li>As a person who cannot swallow pills the is very important to me and it works perfect !</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t crush at all but good with holding pills.</li>
      <li>Good product for a good price.</li>
      <li>When you need to cut pills, or want to crush them, it is handy.</li>
      <li>I recommend buying one with a diamond pattern in its grinder, much more effective.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>it breaks easily if dropped, a coworker borrowed it and returned it with the pill splitter side chipped.</li>
      <li>I have strong hands, and so does my housekeeper.  </li>
      <li>and you need a really strong man to unstick it.</li>
      <li>so glad i found it my old one broke and couldnt find it in stores so very glad you had one</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for crushing tablets for little kids.</li>
      <li>Easy to wipe out and clean.</li>
      <li>Never-mind actually crushing anything, never-mind</li>
      <li>the more I used it, and as time went on, I ended up needing a new one.</li>
      <li>if you can&#x27;t figure out how to use something like this without instructions then you really are not even smart enough to be crushing your own pills anyways.</li>
      <li>Never used, bought the smaller one, that I had previously, from the drug store and it works great!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The screw action top simply stops turning when it reached the top of the pills or capsules in the bottom.</li>
      <li>Grinds pills to a fine dust if you need it that soft...</li>
      <li>This could be better, (thinking about turning it back in soon)</li>
      <li>What you get is exactly what is pictured.  </li>
      <li>It crushes to a very fine powder that I then add to applesauce to help take the bitter out of the pill.</li>
      <li>I purchased this to crush large potassium pills.  </li>
      <li>This is a poor design for anyone without a great deal of hand strength.</li>
      <li>The crushing side can be rather difficult because it is smooth on top and bottom and often becomes off track while grinding so it gets stuck</li>
      <li>It lasted me almost a whole year before I dropped it and broke it</li>
      <li>The pill comes out as a fine powder and the inside of the container is smooth and does NOT have the grinding teeth like some others that make it hard to get all of the pill out of the bottom.</li>
      <li>, I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
      <li>Moreover, the gap between the bottom of the crusher part and the bottom of the container is too wide for a lot of pills - no contact gets made, let alone crushing.</li>
      <li>Not anything exciting, but it does the job and feels solid.</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for, for less than $4, lasting a year is good in my opinion, especially since it was my fault</li>
      <li>I have only crushed small pills about the size of an aspirin or smaller but for that size pill, it is perfect.</li>
      <li>Only looks pretty.</li>
      <li>works and the color green makes it easy to spot if you have a bunch of vials of meds and vitamins.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are no instructions, and no other writing on the package.  </li>
      <li>Which is fine because it sucks as a pill splitter.</li>

    <li> I bought this product on Amazon last year for less than $4 with shipping. It lasted me almost a whole year before I dropped it and broke it so I am now buying another one. It was my fault that I dropped it on the tile floor, the small crack that it made became bigger and bigger the more I used it, and as time went on, I ended up needing a new one. I have only crushed small pills about the size of an aspirin or smaller but for that size pill, it is perfect. The pill comes out as a fine powder and the inside of the container is smooth and does NOT have the grinding teeth like some others that make it hard to get all of the pill out of the bottom. You get what you pay for, for less than $4, lasting a year is good in my opinion, especially since it was my fault it broke. I saw someone on here complaining that it did not come with instruction.....if you can&#x27;t figure out how to use something like this without instructions then you really are not even smart enough to be crushing your own pills anyways. It is simple to use and does not need instructions.</li>
    <li> This does just what it says it does, and does it reliably. When you need to cut pills, or want to crush them, it is handy.</li>
    <li> Used it once and it boke</li>
    <li> As advertised, works great</li>
    <li> Works well, saw it way cheaper and local store.</li>
    <li> so glad i found it my old one broke and couldnt find it in stores so very glad you had one</li>
    <li> Works great. Feels sturdy. Easy to wipe out and clean. Not anything exciting, but it does the job and feels solid. Good product for a good price. It seems like these are never around in the store when you need one. We bought two.</li>
    <li> for people who can&#x27;t or have trouble swallowing pills; something like this is absolutely required.  Either the pills are getting harder or this item doesn&#x27;t function quite as well as ones I have had in the past.  However, when this one wears out, I will be looking for another one.</li>
    <li> This could be better, (thinking about turning it back in soon) it doesn&#x27;t crush at all but good with holding pills.</li>
    <li> This pill crusher/cutter works great for me. It crushes to a very fine powder that I then add to applesauce to help take the bitter out of the pill.</li>
    <li> It does not cut any pills it it is just waist of money. Only looks pretty. I do not recomment it to anyone</li>
    <li> This us a must have for anyone who needs to crush pills ,it is so simple to use and it is well made, I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This pill crusher was awful... It was not textured on the bottom to crush the pills.  The bottom is smooth, making it impossible to crush pills.  Never used, bought the smaller one, that I had previously, from the drug store and it works great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to crush large potassium pills.  I could not crush them.  I have strong hands, and so does my housekeeper.  She eventually crushed one, but it took a lot of work.  It is useless for potassium pills.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Being plastic it breaks easily if dropped, a coworker borrowed it and returned it with the pill splitter side chipped. Which is fine because it sucks as a pill splitter. The crushing side can be rather difficult because it is smooth on top and bottom and often becomes off track while grinding so it gets stuck and you need a really strong man to unstick it. I recommend buying one with a diamond pattern in its grinder, much more effective.</li>
    <li> Hard to crush hard pills.</li>
    <li> It is not a clean device. It gets messy once it grinds the pill. Can only do 1 pill at a time.</li>
    <li> This is a poor design for anyone without a great deal of hand strength. Arthritics need not apply. Moreover, the gap between the bottom of the crusher part and the bottom of the container is too wide for a lot of pills - no contact gets made, let alone crushing. I returned mine after 24 hours.</li>
    <li> As a person who cannot swallow pills the is very important to me and it works perfect ! Grinds pills to a fine dust if you need it that soft...love it</li>
    <li> I have been using this pill crusher for two years now . It&#x27;s perfect for crushing tablets for little kids.</li>
    <li> This is impossible to twist and gets stuck. Never-mind actually crushing anything, never-mind someone that is weaker or has arthritis. Move on!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Pill crusher it does it&#x27;s job</li>
    <li> ~&lt;br /&gt;Real nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works and the color green makes it easy to spot if you have a bunch of vials of meds and vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The divide storage area is excellent.</li>
    <li> What you get is exactly what is pictured.  There are no instructions, and no other writing on the package.  Best wishes figuring out how to use this item.</li>
    <li> This pill crusher doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to crush caplets.  .....Nope.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to crush capsules .....Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The screw action top simply stops turning when it reached the top of the pills or capsules in the bottom.</li>
