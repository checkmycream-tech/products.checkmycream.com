      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
      <li>The best nude color if you have dry lips.</li>
      <li>Conditioning Lip Balm in Nice and Natural has surprising staying power and provides a pretty lovely lip look when paired with a good liner (I like the very inexpensive Essence in #11, In the Nude.)</li>
      <li>It leaves your lips very most and does not fade fast.</li>
      <li>Love the color I have this lip balm in nice and natural .I</li>
      <li>I use it before adding my lip liner and lipstick and it makes everything look so smooth</li>

      <li>Have ordered this multiple times and I am about to stock up on more for backup!</li>
      <li>And the color is so light that I was even able to use it on my daughter when she had dry lips.</li>
      <li>Not quite as rich as the other two products but still creates the look I love.</li>
      <li>Very disapointed!</li>
      <li>It really makes your lips soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The color is nice but the smell is odd and it seems to slide off your lips.</li>
      <li>It went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t have a sticky feel hours later even.  </li>
      <li>It stays on lips and it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very creamy.</li>
      <li>I love the packaging and the little glass &#x27;compact&#x27; the product is in.  </li>
      <li>The two products, when compared to my old Bobbi Brown liner and NARS color, is like, a quarter of the price and still a very wearable combo.</li>
      <li>It arrived timely and I will most likely try other products.</li>
      <li>The price and just right and the color is very natural for everyday use.</li>

<li> It also did not take long to arrive it</li>
<li> Love the little shine and the slight sweet flavor doesn&#x27;t make it annoying if your tongue grazes your lips.  </li>
<li> This product works wonders for dry lips.  </li>
<li> I thought it was too thin at first to give me the NARS Chelsea Girls (discontinued) nude lip I wanted.</li>
<li> Needing to use a little brush makes for many more obstacles to quick/easy application, and since I&#x27;m using it for sunscreen lip protection, it&#x27;s awkward to have to carry a gooey-tipped little application brush around since THAT gets dirty, lost in my purse, etc.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d rate higher, but it&#x27;s difficult to put on without a little brush, unless you want germ finger tip application.  </li>
<li> It makes my lips burn and is way too dark..</li>
<li> but the color is dark</li>
<li> This product is a little small.</li>
<li> Almost too thick.  </li>
<li> but I wont buy it again because I don&#x27;t like my finger getting dirty from it.</li>

    <li> I like that it has spf but I wont buy it again because I don&#x27;t like my finger getting dirty from it. Next time I will buy it in a stick. Also, I am fair/light and it makes my lips kind of disappear.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! The price and just right and the color is very natural for everyday use. It leaves your lips very most and does not fade fast. I will defiantly buy this in the future. It also did not take long to arrive it came it great condition.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for dry lips.  I use it before adding my lip liner and lipstick and it makes everything look so smooth</li>
    <li> but the color is dark</li>
    <li> I thought it was too thin at first to give me the NARS Chelsea Girls (discontinued) nude lip I wanted. And it isn&#x27;t the same. But e.l.f. Conditioning Lip Balm in Nice and Natural has surprising staying power and provides a pretty lovely lip look when paired with a good liner (I like the very inexpensive Essence in #11, In the Nude.) The two products, when compared to my old Bobbi Brown liner and NARS color, is like, a quarter of the price and still a very wearable combo. Not quite as rich as the other two products but still creates the look I love. e.l.f. could sell their products for much more than they do, but I&#x27;m glad they don&#x27;t. Big fan.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve never had any before and I used it once. Very pretty color, and it tastes great it doesn&#x27;t taste like a &amp;#34;make up&amp;#34; item. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the little shine and the slight sweet flavor doesn&#x27;t make it annoying if your tongue grazes your lips.  Worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Love the color I have this lip balm in nice and natural .I love the smell.and works well on my lips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rate higher, but it&#x27;s difficult to put on without a little brush, unless you want germ finger tip application.  Needing to use a little brush makes for many more obstacles to quick/easy application, and since I&#x27;m using it for sunscreen lip protection, it&#x27;s awkward to have to carry a gooey-tipped little application brush around since THAT gets dirty, lost in my purse, etc.  There&#x27;s no place to store a brush properly on the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, once on, it rules!</li>
    <li> Loved this lipgloss. It stays on lips and it&#x27;s very convenient. Loved the color!</li>
    <li> I was searching for some good nude lip products and I heard this was one of the best so I found it on amazon for a great price and bought it; product was shipped and received in good time as well as being well packaged.  I love the packaging and the little glass &#x27;compact&#x27; the product is in.  Smells really good and is truly a nude shade!  Will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Loveeee this lip balm!!!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff:) looks good and natural:)</li>
    <li> The best nude color if you have dry lips. I can not use regular nude lipsticks because they just flake off my lips, but this never ever dries out. I have very red lips naturally and this covers it up perfectly without making me look like a zombie. Have ordered this multiple times and I am about to stock up on more for backup! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This product was wonderful!  It went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t have a sticky feel hours later even.  And the color is so light that I was even able to use it on my daughter when she had dry lips.</li>
    <li> It hydrates my lips while giving a nice soft and shiny color to it. It arrived timely and I will most likely try other products.</li>
    <li> This product is a little small. But good quality, im so happy with my order&lt;br /&gt;So anyway i recommend to buy it.</li>
    <li> Not as great as I had hoped. It&#x27;s very creamy. Almost too thick.  The color is nice but the smell is odd and it seems to slide off your lips.</li>
    <li> Color not close to picture or I would like it. Brown color  and cannot use. Pictures should match color you order</li>
    <li> Luvvvvvv  it feel Sexy</li>
    <li> It is a very good, creamy product. Smells like coconuts or tanning lotion like most people say. It wasn&#x27;t fantastic but a good product. Came on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> It makes my lips burn and is way too dark.. I will never wear this. Very disapointed! Save your money.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. It really makes your lips soft and smooth. I put it on at night and when I wake up my lips are moist.</li>
    <li> the best nude balm i have ever used! goes on like a chapstick but looks like a lipstick. it does not leave any crease marks and smells delish!</li>
