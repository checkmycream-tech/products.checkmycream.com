      <li>The makeup wasn&#x27;t as effective without it.</li>

      <li>It is very comfortable.</li>
      <li>This foundation has very light coverage.</li>
      <li>Product is very light, runny liquid.</li>
      <li>This foundation makes me glow and it looks very smooth.</li>
      <li>My wife loves this product, I love my wife, so that means I love this product too.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad i switched...</li>
      <li>I love how light feeling it is!</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>Be sure to blend, try using one drop at a time and you can always add more, easier this way that to take away and have a cakey looking face.</li>
      <li>Love this foundation.</li>
      <li>I had tried it in store and wanted to get a better price</li>
      <li>You have to somehow magically shake 2 drops onto your brush.  </li>
      <li>I love the foundation.  </li>
      <li>Light coverage skin feels nice.</li>
      <li>I love the way this make up makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>Sounds like it works wonders for many, so this was probably just a skin-type issue for me.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this foundation.</li>
      <li>Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Light texture that easily blends into your skin and doesn&#x27;t make your face fill</li>
      <li>The product arrived quickly and it goes on nicely.  </li>
      <li>gives me great natural coverage.</li>
      <li>and therefore will eventually absorb and wear off, but this product covers beautifully if you use the Foundation Primer first, then the Pure Serum Foundation</li>
      <li>It offers great coverage and is so light.</li>
      <li>I noticed with the powder foundation that it rubbed off easily</li>
      <li>Sits in fine lines and pores, and accentuates any patches of dryness.</li>
      <li>The problem is that the product SITS IN your fine lines.</li>
      <li>It is light coverage, you need concealer over this.</li>
      <li>An hour after applying I looked in the mirror and had to smooth it all out again.</li>
      <li>It is light and blends well, wears all day.  </li>
      <li>When you get close to the underneath of your eyes smooth out the foundation with your fingers</li>
      <li>be honest, using your real skin tone and not the one you wish to create.</li>
      <li>Take a buffer brush and smooth it in.</li>
      <li>and it is wonderfully light.  </li>
      <li>Also use a light powder over it because it does shine.</li>
      <li>It is quick and easy to apply, and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>My skin is aging, so I switched from the original powder minerals to this.  </li>
      <li>Best to apply near natural light or a very well lit room.</li>
      <li>Full coverage.</li>
      <li>This foundation goes on very VERY VERY SHINY!</li>
      <li>And let it dry for a good minute before you decide to put on powder or another makeup.</li>
      <li>I like knowing that I get great coverage, am putting less on my face, get some sunscreen, and am using a more natural product.  </li>
      <li>Have fun with your make up</li>
      <li>and it looks more natural.</li>
      <li>Pink skin is cool, peach or golden skin is warm.</li>
      <li>But when I went to Nordstrom the other day to check out makeup for my wedding day, the woman helping me told me that whatever I &amp;#34;use for foundation is really good, and not to change what I do.&amp;#34; BUT she did say to never put foundation under your eyes, like, where your bags are.</li>
      <li>So, for my skin, it took figuring out the right combination of lotion and primer or veil.</li>
      <li>the price is great and Bare Minerals is now the only product I will ever use again for all my make up needs.</li>
      <li>I have used Bare Minerals for years and the new liquid is as good or better than the dry.</li>
      <li>The coverage is actually pretty good for how thin it is, but make sure you shake vigorously between each drop applied.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard very mixed reviews but for my skin which has always been oily but as I&#x27;m getting older is becoming more normal.</li>
      <li>I should note that I have naturally oily skin, so I do use Bare Minerals&#x27; Mineral Veil, and it is absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>My wife is hot</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I will definitely get more when this runs out.</li>
      <li>I switched to BB cream/foundation now but before that out of all my years of trying different liquid foundations this one was my favorite.</li>
      <li>For reference I wear medium beige in the original bare minerals.</li>
      <li>and i bought a foundation brush Walmart that works very well.</li>
      <li>I much rather prefer the mineral in the power form.</li>
      <li>I tried multiple ways to blend it, but it just never looked smooth.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t appear to have a pump which would really help.</li>
      <li>I have a very oily T zone that requires about 2 blotting sheets a day to keep from being too shiny.</li>
      <li>Either way, it was too involved in getting ready for my day and too oily as the day wore on.</li>
      <li>and my skin ended up really oily at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>If it helps, I&#x27;m 37 with typical 37 y/o skin concerns - combo skin, fine lines and some mild melasma.</li>
      <li>Most makeup needs to be applied again at night, due to the oils in your skin.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, I really love the color.</li>
      <li>But I love all their other products!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>let dry, then use your hands or a clean tissue, run your hands or tissue over your face, smoothing out the makeup foundation again in an outward direction, smoothing the finish.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the watery texture that comes out, it dries normal.</li>
      <li>Use a light translucent power to set the makeup with a Large fluffy powder brush.</li>
      <li>This goes fine for about what I would guess is half the bottle</li>
      <li>I really like Bare Mineral products.</li>
      <li>Natural is the key, take the time to find your exact color by going  online to the bareminerals .com</li>
      <li>Be sure to shake well before using because the first couple of times I used it, I thought it was to thin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like it a lot!  Light coverage skin feels nice.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product, I love my wife, so that means I love this product too. My wife is hot so it must work. Follow my wife on her Youtube page. She does makeup vids and tutorials. Thanks! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;yGJOtWXi8ho</li>
    <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Light texture that easily blends into your skin and doesn&#x27;t make your face fill like it has extra makeup on</li>
    <li> I love the way this make up makes my skin feel.  As other reviewers mentioned, you do need the brush to apply.  Be sure to shake well before using because the first couple of times I used it, I thought it was to thin.  As it turns out, it wasn&#x27;t shaken well.  I&#x27;m retired andI switched to this product from the &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; make up I used for years while working and it is wonderfully light.  I&#x27;ll stick with this.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and it goes on nicely.  My only issue is that I ordered a darker color and it seems really light and makes me look really pale.</li>
    <li> This foundation goes on very VERY VERY SHINY! the shine is unbearable and i have to use some powder over it. i used the brush that goes with it. You HAVE to shake the bottle before applying, or else the product will sink into the brush and disappear. It is light coverage, you need concealer over this. Over all, it did not meet my expectations and i havent used it evr since. I hate that shine, having oily skin. only people with dry skin can use this.</li>
    <li> Most makeup needs to be applied again at night, due to the oils in your skin.  This foundation does not clog oil glands, which is a big plus girls!... and therefore will eventually absorb and wear off, but this product covers beautifully if you use the Foundation Primer first, then the Pure Serum Foundation and I always use a mineral veil powder to set it.  I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This foundation has very light coverage. At first I didn&#x27;t like it, and I was very disappointed. But when I went to Nordstrom the other day to check out makeup for my wedding day, the woman helping me told me that whatever I &amp;#34;use for foundation is really good, and not to change what I do.&amp;#34; BUT she did say to never put foundation under your eyes, like, where your bags are. The underneath of your eyes is a different shade than the rest of your face, which is why there are concealers out there. So my final suggestions with this foundation: dab a little on your face. Take a buffer brush and smooth it in. When you get close to the underneath of your eyes smooth out the foundation with your fingers so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally get under your eyes. And let it dry for a good minute before you decide to put on powder or another makeup. This makeup looks different once it dries, and rushing to put more makeup on might ruin it (this foundation starts as sheer coverage and becomes less sheer as it dries).</li>
    <li> i love it and i bought a foundation brush Walmart that works very well. When applying under eyes use your fingers. gives me great natural coverage. Also use a light powder over it because it does shine. i used to use Elizabeth Arden and I am so glad i switched...the price is great and Bare Minerals is now the only product I will ever use again for all my make up needs.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It offers great coverage and is so light. It&#x27;s almost like it turns into powder as you are using it.  I will definitely get more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t like this is because it seemed to look to &amp;#34;pancakey&amp;#34; I tried using less but it still looked too heavy on my skin. I much rather prefer the mineral in the power form.</li>
    <li> My skin is aging, so I switched from the original powder minerals to this.  I like it, but it tends to accentuate my pores and isn&#x27;t quite a &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; as I had hoped.  I like it, but need to get used to the different look and feel compared to the powder foundation.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. I like knowing that I get great coverage, am putting less on my face, get some sunscreen, and am using a more natural product.  My face seems happy, too. (I break out less)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combination skin note:  I have combination skin and this is a bit luminescent for the oily spots. So, for my skin, it took figuring out the right combination of lotion and primer or veil. Once I did, though, I got good results and it seems to stay put. I put &amp;#34;reapply occasionally&amp;#34; because on its own, it does need to be reapplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush:  Side note on the applicator brush (sold sep): As much as I hate to say it (I initially thought this was an add-on sales technique) I tried the product without the brush. The makeup wasn&#x27;t as effective without it.</li>
    <li> I love the foundation.  It is light and blends well, wears all day.  HOwever, like all Bare Minerals products, the packaging is awful.  You have to somehow magically shake 2 drops onto your brush.  This goes fine for about what I would guess is half the bottle and then it is near impossible to get the rest to shake out where you want it to go.  I still have some left in my old bottle.  I can hear it but I can&#x27;t get it out!</li>
    <li> I have medium fair skin. with redness and combination skin.  a little oily a little dry and a little normal. I used a makeup sponge as well as using a foundation brush and each time I got very good coverage. The trick is to shake the bottle well, use a foundation primer before using this  as this is a mineral and will sit on the skin , including dry flaky spots and lines. A primer will help immensely. It is recommended that you start in the center of your face, buffing the brush in a circular motion outwards towards and into the hairline, over the eyelids and down into the neck. let dry, then use your hands or a clean tissue, run your hands or tissue over your face, smoothing out the makeup foundation again in an outward direction, smoothing the finish. Use a light translucent power to set the makeup with a Large fluffy powder brush. Best to apply near natural light or a very well lit room. Starting with a blank canvas like this will help you find your natural color undertones for blush, lip color and eye shadows. Be sure to blend, try using one drop at a time and you can always add more, easier this way that to take away and have a cakey looking face. Natural is the key, take the time to find your exact color by going  online to the bareminerals .com and use their foundation finder. be honest, using your real skin tone and not the one you wish to create. Look in the inside of your wrists to see if you have blue veins ( cool) green veins ( olive) blue/green ( neutral ) Pink skin is cool, peach or golden skin is warm. I hope this helps.  Have fun with your make up, you wear it, don&#x27;t let it wear you. :D</li>
    <li> This is a great product that applies great coverage but does not give you the make-up look!  It is very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I really like Bare Mineral products. Unfortunately for me, this particular product just doesn&#x27;t work with my skin type. I have a very oily T zone that requires about 2 blotting sheets a day to keep from being too shiny. I looked up tutorials online and read through reviews regarding this product. I tried two different types of high end primers as well as the recommended brush. The product left an odd, patchy pattern on my skin. I tried multiple ways to blend it, but it just never looked smooth. The product sat in my lines and caused the worst oiliness of any foundation I&#x27;ve tried. Perhaps my oily T zone is why the splotchy pattern kept re-appearing. Or maybe I was doing something wrong. Either way, it was too involved in getting ready for my day and too oily as the day wore on. Sounds like it works wonders for many, so this was probably just a skin-type issue for me. If it helps, I&#x27;m 37 with typical 37 y/o skin concerns - combo skin, fine lines and some mild melasma.</li>
    <li> Messy and leaves face feeling greasy</li>
    <li> Beautiful coverage, perfect color. Love!!</li>
    <li> Reviews are right, this stuff sucks. I didn&#x27;t mind the watery texture that comes out, it dries normal. The problem is that the product SITS IN your fine lines. An hour after applying I looked in the mirror and had to smooth it all out again. There are so many great products out there and normally bareMinerals is awesome. This one product is not good. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Went to the mall to get my official shade and the product was back ordered. I got tired of waiting for the product to come in so I ordered it off of amazon. It goes on easy, great color match, easy to use. Knowing I can get it off of Amazon instead of driving 45 minutes to the mall makes it even better!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this foundation. I have tried other powder makeup from MAC and Bare Minerals, and I decided I wanted to try liquid foundation. It is quick and easy to apply, and stays on all day. I noticed with the powder foundation that it rubbed off easily and my skin ended up really oily at the end of the day. I should note that I have naturally oily skin, so I do use Bare Minerals&#x27; Mineral Veil, and it is absolutely amazing. I should also site that I went in-store to get this product and had it matched to my skin. I do believe that it is cheaper on Amazon and I will be buying this product here from now on.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for light coverage this is great...if more cover-up is necessary then you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this foundation. Not cakey, and doesn&#x27;t suffocate my skin.</li>
    <li> I love how light feeling it is!</li>
    <li> Love all bareMinerals makeup!  It takes very little to cover and look natural.</li>
    <li> Im loving this foundation. I&#x27;ve heard very mixed reviews but for my skin which has always been oily but as I&#x27;m getting older is becoming more normal. This foundation makes me glow and it looks very smooth. I use the real techniques stippling brush to apply and I only use about 3 drops to cover my face. For reference I wear medium beige in the original bare minerals.</li>
    <li> Awesome coverage, easy to use, love it!!</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage but natural looking.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give this a 5 star is that it is hard to get out. It doesn&#x27;t appear to have a pump which would really help. Other than that, I really love the color. Matches my skin perfect and looks flawless.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Feels great going on. Adds moisture. I have used Bare Minerals for years and the new liquid is as good or better than the dry.</li>
    <li> Used this because all makeup seems to break me out, after using this my breakouts stopped. The coverage I&#x27;d say is medium but its not cakey looking and it looks more natural. Only issue I saw over time is that it made my skin look kinda dry on my face. I switched to BB cream/foundation now but before that out of all my years of trying different liquid foundations this one was my favorite.</li>
    <li> As some background - I am 30, fair skinned, and was not impressed. Product is very light, runny liquid. The coverage is actually pretty good for how thin it is, but make sure you shake vigorously between each drop applied. Does not cover redness completely or trouble spots at all. Sits in fine lines and pores, and accentuates any patches of dryness. My skin is usually very oily and this product made me look dry along my forehead, under eyes and around nose even when moisturizing beforehand. Product wiped away easily - not for all day wear, but it does have a very light texture even when dried, just not meant for aging or anything other than normal skin textures. I recommend applying with fingers - I tried a stippling brush, a sponge, a buffing brush and also a flat foundation brush - you could see every stroke when dried - blend well!!!</li>
    <li> Such a disappointment. Chalky and blah. But I love all their other products!</li>
    <li> I really loved this makeup. I had tried it in store and wanted to get a better price and I did. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Full coverage. Feels like wearing nothing at all.</li>
