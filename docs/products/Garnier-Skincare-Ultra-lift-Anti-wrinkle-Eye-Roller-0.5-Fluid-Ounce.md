      <li>great seller!  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with it!</li>
      <li>magnificent...  </li>
      <li>I tried the ball just to see and the perfect amount comes out.</li>
      <li>Lol!</li>
      <li>Good products!</li>
      <li>Even feels good putting on!</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ve bought it.</li>
      <li>my husband immediately noticed the difference and commented on how great my under eyes looked...and he didn&#x27;t even know I&#x27;d used the product...</li>
      <li>My lines are now softer and I&#x27;m happy with the affects.</li>
      <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t know it it diminishes lines but is so convenient to keep moisture in the eye area!</li>
      <li>but it does feel good and cooling ....</li>
      <li>and it looked good, so I decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>The cream and the price for it are good though,</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, it leaves a very good feeling, and I have not had any allergic reaction, I am pleased with this product and will keep using it to see more results.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love the convenience of it too!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, I don&#x27;t get why it was discontinued!</li>
      <li>I have tried many under eye anti wrinkle creams and this is my favorite...worth the price too!</li>
      <li>To be honest, in a week I can&#x27;t see differences yet.</li>
      <li>I liked the product.  </li>
      <li>great PRICE AND QUICK SHIPMENT</li>
      <li>Plus it being where you can just &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; it on makes it very easy to use.</li>
      <li>The roller ball is cool, and feels incredibly good.  </li>
      <li>I liked that it isnt sticky and it feel nice and cool when you put it on</li>
      <li>I wash my face and use it AFTER applying a very light layer of moisturizer to play it safe for now.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>and I LOVE).  </li>
      <li>This is why I love the product I can put it on the go and not use my finger.</li>
      <li>and im using it more for preventative measures rather than corrective.</li>
      <li>But the product is just ok.  </li>
      <li>The greatest thing I have tried and at such an inexpensive price.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a product with retinol make sure it doesn&#x27;t also have acids.  </li>
      <li>I can say the skin under my eyes looks better</li>
      <li>Likewise, if you&#x27;re looking for a product with acids, like salicylic acid be sure it&#x27;s not combined with retinol.</li>
      <li>I guess I have to use more to see the results</li>
      <li>I use a more concentrated&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer at night.</li>
      <li>love it, like everything of garnier</li>
      <li>It is OK, it refreshed your eyes and feel very cool.</li>
      <li>or I have to find something more accurate to my wrinkle problems.</li>
      <li>And I use it effectively during allergy season to calm my itchy eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of Rx anti-wrinkle creams, but this one worked more quickly AND didn&#x27;t irritate my skin like so many others have.  </li>
      <li>A true miracle product!</li>
      <li>I have, however, experienced a huge unexpected benefit.  </li>
      <li>Application is easy and feels &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; when rolling on.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>I also like the roller, easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I love the cool feeling the product leaves going on with the roller ball.  </li>
      <li>The retinol and acids have great moisturizing, toning, and anti-aging properties on their own; but when combined their ph&#x27;s neutralize each other, compromising their beneficial properties.  </li>
      <li>I am still waiting on improving on the fine lines on my bottom eyelids, and haven&#x27;t seen improvement on my forehead wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I have fine lines under and in the corners of my eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 48 with some fine lines or creeping under my eyes that show up quite well when I apply concealer.</li>
      <li>Super Product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also putting on my \\&quot;elevens\\&quot; on my forehead just for the fun of it :) I&#x27;ll update after a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, and helps de-puff.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic products.</li>
      <li>The roller glides smoothly and leaves a cool-feeling sheen of the product.</li>
      <li>Being a middle-aged woman, I am always happy to hear such a thing!</li>
      <li>I use this religiously twice a day and it is great that it is not oily</li>
      <li>am seeing gradual improvement on the crows feet area, although mine are light.</li>
      <li>So far, I would say it definitely visibly works on fine lines and wrinkles, but if you have deeper set wrinkles, this probably isn&#x27;t the best product.</li>
      <li>I have not seen a significant change, but I don&#x27;t use every day.  </li>
      <li>but is the exact product I have purchased at the drug store for more money.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles as of yet.</li>
      <li>It also feels wonderfully cool to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>Everybody seems to love this product, so I will give it a try and keep using it to see if really works for me</li>
      <li>I suspect that eye rollers are asking for bacteria problems but it feels good and the cool metal ball seems to quiet swollen eyelids.  </li>
      <li>For the money, it is worth getting again.  </li>
      <li>the day after I had put it on, I noticed more deepness in the lines near my nose...never noticed them before.  </li>
      <li>, I have fewer smile wrinkles at the sides of my eyes than my daughter does.</li>
      <li>so I can put my makeup on right over it in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I did some some improvement with very fine lines but not enough improvement for me to continue use.</li>
      <li>I am pleasantly surprised that it seems to be softening the fine lines under my eyes and the crow&#x27;s feet in the corners.</li>
      <li>This is my first time trying this product.</li>
      <li>My first use gave me PTSD.</li>
      <li>Feels very soft and cool to apply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and the skin is soft and full and</li>
      <li>I have very fine lines under my eyes, but did not have any other problems until I used this product.  </li>
      <li>Did absolutely NOTHING for fine lines around eyes even with religious usage, 2x/day for 8 months consecutively</li>
      <li>Now I had puffiness under my eyes accentuating all the fine lines and looking bumpy and really noticing the deep wrinkles at the nose area.  </li>
      <li>I have a red mark where it was, but the skin is completely smooth.  </li>
      <li>So use it up fast before the serum can get contaminated.  </li>
      <li>Will keep buying it, feel clear and fresh after using.</li>
      <li>and I really like it</li>
      <li>dont really know if it reduces puffiness or makes any difference</li>
      <li>I opened a box that looked very worn and inside</li>
      <li>Fast shipping. ..</li>
      <li>Really works, give it two weeks, everyone asked what am I doing, asked if I lost weight.</li>
      <li>Cant tell much difference</li>
      <li>really upset.</li>
      <li>I use it in the morning, before my makeup and it absorbs fast.</li>
      <li>This is a gentle roller that really does seem to help alleviate my around the eye wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think it does anything at all.  </li>
      <li>but I dont really see any difference.</li>
      <li>My nasolabial lines have almost disappeared, especially on the right side!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait for my new order!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t know it it diminishes lines but is so convenient to keep moisture in the eye area! This is why I love the product I can put it on the go and not use my finger.</li>
    <li> I have not seen a significant change, but I don&#x27;t use every day.  I love the cool feeling the product leaves going on with the roller ball.  It does seem to help with under eye puffiness.  For the money, it is worth getting again.  I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I tried this not expecting it to do anything and it has worked miracles.  I have terrible skin around the eye area and this product has significantly improved the appearance of fine lines, dark circles and virtually eliminated some small bumps I had under my eyes.  The greatest thing I have tried and at such an inexpensive price.  I use this religiously twice a day and it is great that it is not oily so I can put my makeup on right over it in the morning.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> It arrived used and damaged, smelled funny and covered in yellow stuff.</li>
    <li> I like the product.And I use it effectively during allergy season to calm my itchy eyes.BUT...The tube,or rather the threads on a tube are scratch the skin while applying  in whatever angle I hold it...I even sanded the threads some...It helped some... but still I would prefer not to use the tube.The cream and the price for it are good though,But I switched to different product this season.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks, although I missed a few days.  I also decided to triple duty it and use it on the nasolabial folds, and the wrinkles/creases I have above my eyebrows. My nasolabial lines have almost disappeared, especially on the right side! I am very pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;I am seeing gradual improvement on the crows feet area, although mine are light. I am still waiting on improving on the fine lines on my bottom eyelids, and haven&#x27;t seen improvement on my forehead wrinkles. I am in my mid-twenties and just started noticing fine wrinkles and wanted to do something before they grow worse. So far, I would say it definitely visibly works on fine lines and wrinkles, but if you have deeper set wrinkles, this probably isn&#x27;t the best product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it came out &amp; have almost no crow&#x27;s feet.  Love the convenience of it too!</li>
    <li> I just received this product on 1/15/15. It is old. I opened a box that looked very worn and inside was a coupon that expired in June 2011! I already had an old one, that is why I was purchasing a new one. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I really do not see any changes! I have significant wrinkles around the eyes(crows feet)...very little change! I was disappointed in the results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but this thing has virtually eliminated the fine lines under my eyes, and noticeably softened (though not eliminated) my crow&#x27;s feet, all in less than 2 weeks.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of Rx anti-wrinkle creams, but this one worked more quickly AND didn&#x27;t irritate my skin like so many others have.  A true miracle product!</li>
    <li> I liked that it isnt sticky and it feel nice and cool when you put it on but I dont really see any difference. A downside is it also leaks into your eye sometimes which may cause irritation.</li>
    <li> Good product. Does what it should.</li>
    <li> After using Strivectin eye cream for years, I decided to try something different.  I purchased this on recommendation of a friend and I must admit that I HAVE noticed a difference since using this roller.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and the skin is soft and full and, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m crazy, but I swear the lines are going away.  I use it in the morning and before bed and follow with Garnier Ultra Lift 2-in-1 Wrinkle Reducer (which I&#x27;ve been using for over a year and I LOVE).  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I use this Garnier and Vitamin E at the same time almost every day that I can&#x27;t really say which one is the responsible for reducing my wrinkles. As we can just roll Garnier around our face, it&#x27;s the easiest product I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ve bought it.</li>
    <li> package was open and the roller looked used</li>
    <li> I always put this on while I&#x27;m driving to class...dont really know if it reduces puffiness or makes any difference but it does feel good and cooling ....</li>
    <li> Came a week before expected date I live in MD and it came from NM in a few days in a brown bubble wrap envelope. Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but it is in working condition I tried the ball just to see and the perfect amount comes out.</li>
    <li> magnificent...  The change is unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I suspect that eye rollers are asking for bacteria problems but it feels good and the cool metal ball seems to quiet swollen eyelids.  So use it up fast before the serum can get contaminated.  And go for the one with caffeine for the maximum lift.</li>
    <li> like Garnier Non-greasy products! Will keep buying it, feel clear and fresh after using. although not about the effects yet..</li>
    <li> Fantastic products. .. my husband immediately noticed the difference and commented on how great my under eyes looked...and he didn&#x27;t even know I&#x27;d used the product... so it&#x27;s a hit!  Fast shipping. .. great seller!  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and am constantly complimented on how few wrinkles I have. Being a middle-aged woman, I am always happy to hear such a thing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 10 days, so I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference yet in my crow&#x27;s feet.  I have, however, experienced a huge unexpected benefit.  The skin tag under my eye which appeared about a year ago has fallen off!  I was considering seeing a dermatologist about it, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $200 - $300 to have it removed, so I just put up with it.  About a week into using Ultra Lift, the skin tag became rather sore.  I wondered if perhaps I should stop using it, but I kept using it and decided to just see what happened.  I woke up yesterday morning and noticed the tag was gone.  I have a red mark where it was, but the skin is completely smooth.  I&#x27;m going to continue using the product, along with a soothing moisturizer.  I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth on this product even if it doesn&#x27;t smooth a single wrinkle.</li>
    <li> I used a total of two of these (the first one to try and the second one I ordered accidentally while on &amp;#34;subscribe &amp; save&amp;#34;) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  Each one lasted approximately 4 months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  Did absolutely NOTHING for fine lines around eyes even with religious usage, 2x/day for 8 months consecutively</li>
    <li> had a mistake of buying it, because i was after for something for eyebags.. this is for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This created dry, swollen red patches all around my eyes with daily use. If you have sense skin, do NOT waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it makes my eyes look less tired and reduces the look of fine lines and wrinkles. Prompt customer service, will order again. Thank you</li>
    <li> Been using this product on my eyes every morning for a year or so (I am in my early 50&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt; I use it in the morning, before my makeup and it absorbs fast. I use a more concentrated&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer at night.</li>
    <li> Love it! Can&#x27;t wait for my new order!</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and really didn&#x27;t expect much. I am pleasantly surprised that it seems to be softening the fine lines under my eyes and the crow&#x27;s feet in the corners. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have a smell nor is there any sticky residue. The roller glides smoothly and leaves a cool-feeling sheen of the product. I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Gave this 1 star because I ordered this and was charged $$, then I got a e-mail where the $$ was refunded with no reason given...So I can not say if this works or not...too bad I was looking forward to trying this out.</li>
    <li> My go-to anti-wrinkle remedy.</li>
    <li> Super Product! Works great. I have used for years, but think they may be discontinuing? Took the crows feet out in less than two weeks, use now as maintenance. Also use on the forehead on space between my eyes.</li>
    <li> Actually left the very tender skin around my eyes red and scabby</li>
    <li> Was too old, peeled off my skin after application.</li>
    <li> Good products! Even feels good putting on!</li>
    <li> Ive only been using this product for a couple weeks and im using it more for preventative measures rather than corrective. The roller pen stays moist and the serum dries quickly without leaving a residue or making your skin feel weird.</li>
    <li> I see a difference around my eyes, even after about a week. The skin appears brighter and a bit less &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34;. Plus it being where you can just &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; it on makes it very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for less than 2 weeks, only at night (through research, I found out that products containing retinol should not be exposed to UV rays from the sun, since that will enhance damage). I have fine lines under and in the corners of my eyes. They are already less noticeable. It also feels wonderfully cool to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the downside. There are vapors or something from this product that burn my eyes for several seconds after applying. I keep my head down while applying to prevent it actually running into my eyes, but it still stings a bit. This is not a big problem at all, especially given teh results.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my other eye cream and have been using other garnier products.  I saw this and it looked good, so I decided to try it.  I have very fine lines under my eyes, but did not have any other problems until I used this product.  the day after I had put it on, I noticed more deepness in the lines near my nose...never noticed them before.  Of course, not thinking, I continued to use the product for the next few days.  Now I had puffiness under my eyes accentuating all the fine lines and looking bumpy and really noticing the deep wrinkles at the nose area.  Very unhappy, as I feel I aged about 20 years over night.  I have decided to stop the product in hopes that it will go away.....really upset.</li>
    <li> I like this product - it does help my under eye wrinkling.....I recommend this product - I hope it works for everyone the way it wowrks for me</li>
    <li> It is OK, it refreshed your eyes and feel very cool. I recommend this product and other Garnier product. Thank you</li>
    <li> great PRICE AND QUICK SHIPMENT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 29 years old, soon to be 30 and since I was a teenager I&#x27;ve always had crows feet and wrinkles under my eyes (deep ones). I just recently started using anti-aging products. (Yeah, I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long) So far I have one week using this product every night before bed. To be honest, in a week I can&#x27;t see differences yet. Feels very soft and cool to apply. Everybody seems to love this product, so I will give it a try and keep using it to see if really works for me or I have to find something more accurate to my wrinkle problems.</li>
    <li> My wife said this product has met her needs and expectations.</li>
    <li> The roller ball is cool, and feels incredibly good.  The experience is so relaxing it&#x27;s almost worth paying for bad chemistry.  The retinol and acids have great moisturizing, toning, and anti-aging properties on their own; but when combined their ph&#x27;s neutralize each other, compromising their beneficial properties.  If you&#x27;re looking for a product with retinol make sure it doesn&#x27;t also have acids.  Likewise, if you&#x27;re looking for a product with acids, like salicylic acid be sure it&#x27;s not combined with retinol.</li>
    <li> love it, like everything of garnier</li>
    <li> I have tried many under eye anti wrinkle creams and this is my favorite...worth the price too! Go for it!</li>
    <li> I liked the product.  I&#x27;m not sure how much it helped.  I really don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles as of yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and I really like it, it leaves a very good feeling, and I have not had any allergic reaction, I am pleased with this product and will keep using it to see more results.</li>
    <li> I adore this product! Not only did it minimized the dark circles under my eyes, it also reduced puffiness in a week 😊</li>
    <li> I think I am still wrinkly.</li>
    <li> the product box was torn and crushed at bottom but it was not a gift .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. Application is easy and feels &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; when rolling on. I can say the skin under my eyes looks better but there is no improvement in wrinkles. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Have been using for years now, I have fewer smile wrinkles at the sides of my eyes than my daughter does.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Easy to use and it works.</li>
    <li> Eyes burning... can&#x27;t see. Lol! I only use this at night. My first use gave me PTSD.</li>
    <li> i got this because it had great reviews, but unfortunately it gave me a rash under my eyes. careful if you have sensitive skin,</li>
    <li> Product does refresh skin around eyes especially in the a.m.  I also use it around my mouth to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I like to use this in my morning routine.  It&#x27;s light, and helps de-puff.  Rollerball is a plus.  It lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t think it does anything at all.  I rolled it on faithfully hoping my dark circles and my creases (age)  would go away or at least be lessened.  I could not see that it had any effect whatsoever on my eye problems.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  It&#x27;s expensive and as far as I can tell it doesn&#x27;t do a darn thing!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 4 years, and it is less expensive on line....but is the exact product I have purchased at the drug store for more money.</li>
    <li> Cant tell much difference</li>
    <li> Really works, give it two weeks, everyone asked what am I doing, asked if I lost weight. Firms up areas applied. Also going to order again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have almost used this product up. I have not seen a noticeable difference in eye wrinkles, but I only use it once a day because it causes me 2 side effects.&lt;br /&gt;1. It is very irritating when it leaks into your eyes. I have oily skin and my creams and lotions tend to migrate into my eyes after several hours. So I use it at night only for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is giving me milia around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I like the roller ball application, but I will be searching for a new eye cream.</li>
    <li> I like it. I guess I have to use more to see the results</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I don&#x27;t get why it was discontinued!</li>
    <li> Provided absolutely no benefit to skin at all. Extremely watery and roller doesn&#x27;t allow even application. Complete waste of money. is the worst eye &amp;#34;lotion?&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 with some fine lines or creeping under my eyes that show up quite well when I apply concealer. I&#x27;ve only used this product two days and I can see the difference. I can suffer from contact dermatitis so I was VERY nervous about using it after reading that some suffered a bad reaction. I wash my face and use it AFTER applying a very light layer of moisturizer to play it safe for now. It&#x27;s not bothered my face at all. My lines are now softer and I&#x27;m happy with the affects. I also like the roller, easy to apply. I&#x27;m also putting on my \\&quot;elevens\\&quot; on my forehead just for the fun of it :) I&#x27;ll update after a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 02/09/13&lt;br /&gt;Well I did some some improvement with very fine lines but not enough improvement for me to continue use.</li>
    <li> But the product is just ok.  It says to use it 2x/day&lt;br /&gt;for the anti-wrinkle effect to work, but I don&#x27;t always&lt;br /&gt;wear make-up and so usually only moisturize 1x/day,&lt;br /&gt;so I doubt I&#x27;ll see the anti-wrinkle effect.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a change since last year November</li>
    <li> This is a gentle roller that really does seem to help alleviate my around the eye wrinkles.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years with no complaints...other than when I run out!!</li>
