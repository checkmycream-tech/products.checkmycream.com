      <li>Because my children s like this product also is recommended for the dentist and they like the flavor also is more better because they come n for package of six and are in better price</li>

      <li>She even loves it more because it is Spongebob.</li>
      <li>My kids love the taste and our dentist loves the results.</li>
      <li>Also, the product had what appeared to be an insert in the bottle that I guess would be used for a replaceable pump on some sort that would attach to it or screw on to the top.</li>
      <li>because it is a cute idea, it just does not have a human-friendly flavor.</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t try to drink it either - he knows better, but he&#x27;s also almost 6</li>
      <li>Kids love this</li>

      <li>It tastes great, easy to use, the right size and colorful.</li>
      <li>It is still sitting in the bathroom full!</li>
      <li>the autoship feature with Amazon has made it easy to keep on hand.</li>

      <li>Just to give another opinion, I thought it tastes fine</li>

      <li>He actually is excited to use it each night.  </li>
      <li>They actually gargle for a full minute!!!</li>
      <li>good dispensing system to avoid large spills &amp; easy to dispense at the same time.</li>
      <li>well...I was worth a try.</li>
      <li>Without this apparatus, you must only pour the contents into a cup or glass of some kind.</li>

      <li>My 5 year old has been able to do so with toothpaste for awhile and he loves this product.  </li>
      <li>My twelve year old says, \\&quot;it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Having said that, there were absolutely no other kids&#x27; rinses that were available for the Subscribe &amp; Save program</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>It makes brushing teeth and dental hygene much easier and welcomed.</li>
      <li>almost doesn&#x27;t sting at all, so I don&#x27;t really know how it works, but either way, it probably isn&#x27;t killing their taste buds either...</li>
      <li>fast shipping ...</li>
      <li>So, I have him rinse his mouth with it until he is ready to brush his teeth.  </li>
      <li>He really likes the packaging and the flavor of the product.  </li>
      <li>But if you use the bubble gum (pink) don&#x27;t think that the kids will just switch to this one easily.  </li>
      <li>My little ones love this</li>
      <li>Have to dilute just a little as the taste is too strong otherwise for my 3 yo.</li>
      <li>There are certain time, for religious reasons, that we cannot use toothpaste and this meets all of our needs.  </li>
      <li>my 4 year old son likes it and uses it every day.</li>
      <li>Sometimes my two year old does not want to brush his teeth, but he does not mind rinsing his mouth with this.</li>
      <li>or it was really old.</li>
      <li>My four year old loves using his mouthwash.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 5 year old to use.  </li>
      <li>My son is the major user of the mouth rinse.  </li>
      <li>My 8 year old son thought this tasted gross.</li>
      <li>My 4yr old daughter loves the taste and uses the mouth wash regularly.  </li>
      <li>It is having the right accessories and things that make life a little easier sometimes.</li>
      <li>I was able to return the other unopened bottles to the merchant for a refund minus shipping and a small restocking fee.</li>

<li> I have read other reviews where parents stated that their kids hated the flavor of this mouthwash but mine enjoy it as much or more than the Bubblegum Blowout flavor.  </li>
<li> I was concerned after reading the reviews about the flavor as we have been using the bubble gum flavor for a long time.</li>
<li> The little one uses this and he likes the taste which is the major plus.</li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t taste bad and has a really neat way of measuring the right amount.</li>
<li> , they prefer the pink bubblegum flavor.</li>
<li> They were using the bubble gum flavored one before, but they decided they didn&#x27;t like that it was pink.</li>
<li> We will stick to the other flavors from now on and stay away from Ocean Berry.</li>
<li> product is definitely kid approved and when it comes to rinsing everyday, it&#x27;s kinda helpful when they want to do it!</li>
<li> He prefers this flavor to the bubble gum flavor or the other products we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> So far they have used most kinds of kid&#x27;s mouthwash, but say this one tastes horrible.  </li>
<li> I tried it, and it really doesn&#x27;t taste bad, although it leaves a thin bitterish taste in the mouth, but that&#x27;s basically true for all mouth rinses..</li>
<li> Just let a few drops fall on the brush and use.  </li>
<li> Since they are generally terrible at brushing and actively shun the dentist, it makes me feel better that they haven&#x27;t given me trouble about using this before bed.</li>
<li> I was initially pretty disappointed that ACT decided to brand their rinse for kids with a cartoon character.</li>
<li> We usually use ACT Bubblegum Blow-out.</li>
<li> Not sure what this one is supposed to smell or taste like.</li>
<li> Not sure what I&#x27;m going to with this stuff now.  </li>
<li> We were tired of going into a store or pharmacy and finding (repeatedly) they were all sold out.</li>
<li> Now I am stuck with 5 &amp; a half bottles.  :(</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what the one reviewer is complaining about unless they got a bad batch</li>
<li> Too bad I now have 6 bottles of the stuff.  </li>
<li> so I was shocked when I saw this as an ingredient.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My four year old loves using his mouthwash. We usually use ACT Bubblegum Blow-out. When the Sponge Bob mouthwash came out my son saw it and wanted to try it. He loves Sponge Bob. Unfortunately, his love of Sponge Bob was not enough. He tried it and said it was really gross. He used it again the next night and then commented on how gross it was. I decided to taste it then...It is gross. I decided to eat the cost and go back to our regular flavor/packaging. It is a shame because it is a cute idea, it just does not have a human-friendly flavor.</li>
    <li> My kids love this and the autoship feature with Amazon has made it easy to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> Have to dilute just a little as the taste is too strong otherwise for my 3 yo.</li>
    <li> My 4yr old daughter loves the taste and uses the mouth wash regularly.  She even loves it more because it is Spongebob.</li>
    <li> Because my children s like this product also is recommended for the dentist and they like the flavor also is more better because they come n for package of six and are in better price</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is doing chemically to my teeth but it doesn&#x27;t taste bad and has a really neat way of measuring the right amount.</li>
    <li> Well, as the only ACT for kids I could find I wanted to buy it.  But if you use the bubble gum (pink) don&#x27;t think that the kids will just switch to this one easily.  They went from &amp;#34;sure I&#x27;ll swish&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;this stuff tastes terrible, Mom!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well...I was worth a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the one reviewer is complaining about unless they got a bad batch or it was really old. I would be concerned about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just checked my Amazon purchases. It appears that my two sons have now used 18+ bottles of the Sponge Bob rinse. They use it twice day, every day. To quote my nine year old, \\&quot;ya, it tastes good. It tastes like water.\\&quot;  My twelve year old says, \\&quot;it&#x27;s fine. It doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything.\\&quot;  They were using the bubble gum flavored one before, but they decided they didn&#x27;t like that it was pink. You could smell and taste the bubble gum. Not sure what this one is supposed to smell or taste like. I wish mine tasted like bubble gum or nothing.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely manner as advertised, and packaged well. I ordered it for my 5 y/o son, who first used the regular &amp;#34;Fresh or Cool Mint&amp;#34; flavor and liked it, (so did I), however, I saw this product and thought it would be better suited for children. My son tried it and told me it was horrible, so I tried and had to agree with him. I was able to return the other unopened bottles to the merchant for a refund minus shipping and a small restocking fee. Also, the product had what appeared to be an insert in the bottle that I guess would be used for a replaceable pump on some sort that would attach to it or screw on to the top. Without this apparatus, you must only pour the contents into a cup or glass of some kind.</li>
    <li> Looks, it is not for kids that cannot spit and rinse.  My 5 year old has been able to do so with toothpaste for awhile and he loves this product.  We use this twice a week to supplement the fluoride.  There are certain time, for religious reasons, that we cannot use toothpaste and this meets all of our needs.  Just let a few drops fall on the brush and use.  Works well for adults as well.</li>
    <li> Just to give another opinion, I thought it tastes fine, my wife thought it tastes fine and our 4- year-old loves it. I would give it a try and taste for yourself.</li>
    <li> I love it for the Kids!</li>
    <li> Speaking for myself and my children - we can&#x27;t stomach the taste.  Not sure what I&#x27;m going to with this stuff now.  Perhaps soak some baby turtles in it to try and make ninjas.</li>
    <li> We have well water so the dentist insists our kids need a flouride treatment - this is easy to use, convenient sizes and the flavor appeals to my kids. I would recommend this to any family who needs added flouride in their dental routine.</li>
    <li> My Son lives it. I love the top how it measures it for the child. Not to fruity tootie  smell either</li>
    <li> Our kids have been using the ACT Bubblegum Blowout mouthwash for a while and love it but I decided to mix it up so I purchased the SpongeBob Ocean Berry flavor.  I have read other reviews where parents stated that their kids hated the flavor of this mouthwash but mine enjoy it as much or more than the Bubblegum Blowout flavor.  Obviously everyone&#x27;s tastebuds are different but if your kids are already fans of the ACT mouthwash line, give this one a try.</li>
    <li> My kids do not like the flavor of this, they prefer the pink bubblegum flavor. It is still sitting in the bathroom full!</li>
    <li> It is having the right accessories and things that make life a little easier sometimes. For instance, having a toothpaste and mouthwash that the kids love. It makes brushing teeth and dental hygene much easier and welcomed. This mouthwash was a hit in my house and the kids love dental hygene time in our house and it is one more way to make this important task fun. It tastes great, easy to use, the right size and colorful. Thank you.</li>
    <li> As we all know, kids can sometimes be picky.  So far they have used most kinds of kid&#x27;s mouthwash, but say this one tastes horrible.  Now I am stuck with 5 &amp; a half bottles.  :(</li>
    <li> I was concerned after reading the reviews about the flavor as we have been using the bubble gum flavor for a long time. (1+ years) However I just acted as if I &amp;#34;knew&amp;#34; this was going to be awesome and my son totally loves it! I smelled it and have to say I probably wouldn&#x27;t be as enthusiastic about the flavor as he is but hey, it is for kids. We use this brand on the recommendation of my son&#x27;s pediatric dentist so I was happy to find a bulk package so I can stop running to the store for it because I always forget to put it on the list.</li>
    <li> My son is the major user of the mouth rinse.  He actually is excited to use it each night.  He prefers this flavor to the bubble gum flavor or the other products we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> my 4 year old son likes it and uses it every day.</li>
    <li> Kids love this they use it every night and get disappointed when we run out so I stocked up great deal</li>
    <li> I have three kids 8, 4, &amp; 2 and all three like to rinse their mouth with it.  They use it right after they brush their teeth and use it at least 3 times a day.  Sometimes my two year old does not want to brush his teeth, but he does not mind rinsing his mouth with this. So, I have him rinse his mouth with it until he is ready to brush his teeth.  This mouth rinse was recommended by my son&#x27;s pediatric dentist.</li>
    <li> My daughter necessities.&lt;br /&gt;- His first experience, after eating - after brushing - bedtime - there were a good habit.&lt;br /&gt;Said my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Mom, I&#x27;m so happy ~ ~ ~ ~ I love SpongeBob&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The little one uses this and he likes the taste which is the major plus. He washes his mouth twice a day on his own after brushing. We ordered it via the subscription program. We were tired of going into a store or pharmacy and finding (repeatedly) they were all sold out.</li>
    <li> I was initially pretty disappointed that ACT decided to brand their rinse for kids with a cartoon character. My kids don&#x27;t watch Spongebob although they know of him and I really had no intention of flaming any interest in the character, esp through an everyday ritual like rinsing. Having said that, there were absolutely no other kids&#x27; rinses that were available for the Subscribe &amp; Save program but this so I got it. Guess it&#x27;s not the end of the world! :)&lt;br /&gt;But I have to say my kid loves to rinse with it and says it&#x27;s so yummy he doesn&#x27;t want to stop rinsing! That&#x27;s good! He doesn&#x27;t try to drink it either - he knows better, but he&#x27;s also almost 6 so age might make a difference if you&#x27;re thinking of getting this for anyone younger than 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is definitely kid approved and when it comes to rinsing everyday, it&#x27;s kinda helpful when they want to do it!</li>
    <li> no burning sensation in mouth, kids like the blue color. taste is good. good dispensing system to avoid large spills &amp; easy to dispense at the same time.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old son thought this tasted gross. We will stick to the other flavors from now on and stay away from Ocean Berry.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this at my local store so buying in bulk helped. My kids love the taste and our dentist loves the results. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I have used ACT since my kids started brushing, they like it a lot, I have to say the taste is great!!!</li>
    <li> My kids love this rinse. They actually gargle for a full minute!!!</li>
    <li> fast shipping ...great price</li>
    <li> My little ones love this and they hate everything. Since they are generally terrible at brushing and actively shun the dentist, it makes me feel better that they haven&#x27;t given me trouble about using this before bed.</li>
    <li> My son loves it. I like the way the container controlls the amount  he uses in one swish. I also like him getting in the habit of caring for his teeth, and this product is a fun, kid-friendly way to get him off to a good start.</li>
    <li> My kids love the bubblegum one but this one is as good!</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the ingredients before buying this.  Sucralose?  yuck!  I would never feed my kids something with sucralose in it so I was shocked when I saw this as an ingredient.  Too bad I now have 6 bottles of the stuff.  Wouldn’t this be counter-acting anything good a mouthwash would do??</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 5 year old to use.  I&#x27;m trying to teach him the importance of a healthy mouth.  He really likes the packaging and the flavor of the product.  The self-measuring top is super convenient for both my son and myself because he can do it himself.  I signed up for a subscription for this so he can continue using it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite mouthwashes. Great flavor, nice design concept too.</li>
    <li> GRAND KIDS HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT A YEAR. NO CAVITIES.</li>
    <li> Works well for my six-year-old. He has no problem with the flavor.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for months now, since the kids don&#x27;t mind the taste. I tried it, and it really doesn&#x27;t taste bad, although it leaves a thin bitterish taste in the mouth, but that&#x27;s basically true for all mouth rinses..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It almost doesn&#x27;t sting at all, so I don&#x27;t really know how it works, but either way, it probably isn&#x27;t killing their taste buds either...</li>
    <li> Kids Love It! I feel it helps contribute to a healthier mouth and gums.</li>
    <li> This has been so helpful getting my son to love brushing. He knows the routine and this is his reward before bedtime. The easy measure neck is his favorite and of course... the spitting is fun as well.</li>
