<li> so I have dry and oily skin</li>

<li> I purchased this product because it was recommended for my dry hands.  </li>
<li> skin feels too dry after rinsing</li>
<li> - I&#x27;ll never buy any other bar soap again!</li>
<li> Although Manuka soap is somewhat expensive, the bar does last a long time.</li>
<li> This soap, along with the use of a homemade astringent of Witch Hazel and raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar has improved the tone and  texture of my skin and lessened the appearance of my pores.</li>
<li> Bad experience</li>

    <li> excellent stuff it really helps with uneven or combination skin I have psoriasis so I have dry and oily skin I haven&#x27;t used this for very long but it does seem to be making a difference very happy with this product so far,and it will last because a little goes a long way as in it lathers or suds readily without having to use much,I am just using it for my face though,but even used for more body surface it should still last quit awhile just try to pay attention to how much it actually takes to get the job done :)</li>
    <li> Very calm to my skin.</li>
    <li> Helping with diabetes scars,will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> drying my face and body...Guess will use it as HAND SOAP... Bad experience</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping! Lovely Soap!</li>
    <li> loved using this skincare.  loved everytime i used it thinking of the nurturing it was giving my skin &amp; body.  lasted a nice length of time.  really a great soap.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was recommended for my dry hands.  From the first time I used it I noticed a difference.  My hands are much better now.  I started using it in the shower and have notice my legs and feet are not as dry as they were.</li>
    <li> This soap is ok, but I may not buy it again. I tried one that was creamier and solid; but this one is clear and has a Strong Scent to it. It&#x27;s not as bad as the Alba Bontanica Sea Mineral Cleansing Gel, but it&#x27;s pretty strong. I&#x27;m using it and I haven&#x27;t had burning eyes or anything from it and I have no reactions from using it. My skin is not overly dry after washing my face, so I&#x27;ll just use this up and try looking for the creamier one I bought last time. :)</li>
    <li> I thought it was a good soap from what I read from someone with cancer treatments.It isn&#x27;t has good as I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> Lovely stuff - I&#x27;ll never buy any other bar soap again!</li>
    <li> Love this soap, makes your skin feel clean and soft. Very gentle, can be used by people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> After researching the benefits of Manuka Honey, I decided to switch from my daily facial routine and give this soap a try. I am so happy I did! This soap, along with the use of a homemade astringent of Witch Hazel and raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar has improved the tone and  texture of my skin and lessened the appearance of my pores. Even my dermatologist noticed the difference! Although Manuka soap is somewhat expensive, the bar does last a long time. I will continue to use this soap!</li>
    <li> Used this soap last night for the first time.  Very soothing. Like it a lot.  Recommend this product, very nice feel on the skin</li>
    <li> Love this soap and leave your skin smelling great.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and I really love the soap!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a glycerin like bar, and it&#x27;s good, but not better than Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soaps.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a honey soap that was not highly fragrant that would leave my skin feeling soft and silky.  My skin is very sensitive and this is perfect for me as it is does not irritate as some other soaps did.  I have already reordered and will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> This is really nice soap, leaves my skin so soft and smooth.  The two pack is convenient--one for the basin and another for the shower.</li>
    <li> Love this soap lathers rich and smell wonderful your entire shower will smell like honey.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels great. My skin loves it.</li>
    <li> Thanks to the seller for getting this to me quickly and in great condition.  I&#x27;ve recently learned about the healing properties of Manuka Honey and have bought several Manuka Honey products.  Of the ones I&#x27;ve tried I can say I believe it does have antibiotic properties (I cut my finger with my chef&#x27;s knife and in a week it was healed using Manuka Magic cream).  So I tried this soap to use daily and it smells great.  Manuka seems to have a unique scent - not sweet, just unique.  I will buy again when both soaps are gone.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It is sweet smelling and leaves my skin so soft.  I have sensitive skin and am prone to reacting to soaps and lotion.  I can always count on this soap to clear up any reaction</li>
    <li> skin feels too dry after rinsing</li>
