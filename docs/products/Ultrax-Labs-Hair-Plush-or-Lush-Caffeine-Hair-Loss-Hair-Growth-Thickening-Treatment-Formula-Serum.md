<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have not seen any results from this product been using for 1month</li>
    <li> This product actually works and almost immediately.  The one thing I have noticed after using for a few weeks, that it can affect the texture of your hair if you use wet working through the hair.  It is best to work it into your scalp and not comb through hair.  So, if wet work into scalp and dry hair or use while hair is dry.  Definitely a game changer for thinning hair!</li>
    <li> My hair needed some help and this product was just what I needed! I am a girl, and I&#x27;m rough on my hair - straightening irons, curlers, hair dryers. My thinning, brittle hair breaks off and falls out so easily it&#x27;s scary. After just a few days of using this product, I&#x27;m noticing the breakage and the shedding is very much improved. My hair is thick, full and bouncy - beautiful! I love it! I&#x27;m excited about what a few weeks of using this product will do for my hair. We&#x27;re so mean to our hair. Do something good for your hair, try this product.</li>
    <li> Has a strengthening affect on the hair, meaning the hair does not fall out as much when brushing, showering,  etc. Also, the hair strands  look and feel thicker and more robust.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily now as my hair was dull and flat. Not only did I noticed the difference I have a better natural look and shine! My hair is full and lovely :). I had to add it to my daily routine. Simple to apply and serum is not sticky, messy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This treatment worked wonders. I&#x27;ve had to deal with thinning hair for a while now, and within a week of using this I started seeing major results. The results are amazing, and the serum itself is also amazing. The serum isn&#x27;t runny or greasy, and doesn&#x27;t give your hair an oily shine like other serums.</li>
    <li> I regularly use this product and I&#x27;ll tell you what, it works!  My hair is becoming noticeably thicker and I will continue using this is the future.  I recommend to anyone who thinks they may need a little push start into the world of healthy and thick hair :)</li>
    <li> A nice light serum to go with the rest of their products. Comes with a pump attached, so it&#x27;s creates less of a mess than close top bottles. They use peppermint oil, so it leaves a minty scent afterwards. I have hair that likes to shed, and have noticed significantly less hair breakage since using this product, in conjunction with their shampoo. It also seems more voluminous afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really good product!</li>
    <li> Best hair growth and thickening item that is out there in stores today! I am so happy my hair is growing and I see results almost immediately! Definitely will purchase again</li>
    <li> This product has done a fantastic job of making my hair thicker and shinier. I love the products from this line and though I hadn&#x27;t used a serum type thickening treatment before, I am a believer now! You just need a little bit, as it goes a long way. I use it on wet or dry hair. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is fuller, shinier and stronger, more resilient to breakage since using this line and this treatment! It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
    <li> After using this product for a while I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is fuller and thicker. It doesn&#x27;t leave any weird sticky residue behind and I love that, like all Ultrax hair products, it gives my scalp a refreshing tingling feeling. I strongly recommend Hair Lush for anyone struggling hair thinning because this will really help you.</li>
    <li> I use this serum in conjunction with the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge shampoo. Really love how my hair feels after drying and combing; noticeably thicker and softer hair while adding volume and bounce. Great product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend Ultrax Labs&#x27; Hair Lush serum to men and women who are suffer from hair loss, thinning, or damaged hair. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with similar products for years but this is the first time I&#x27;ve found a product that is a good value and has all the features I&#x27;ve been looking; it&#x27;s fast and easy to use, doesn&#x27;t leave crusty or oily residue, and delivers noticeable results quickly. After the first use my hair was instantly thicker and fuller. Within the first week I saw that the strands were thicker, stronger, and healthier, even when the product wasn&#x27;t in my hair. The lightweight serum continues to improve the look and feel of my hair without weighing it down. Hair Lush has really improved my confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing a product I look at the ingredients and research how the key ingredients work to achieve the desired results. First, it&#x27;s a great product for people like me who have sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of harsh, irritating chemicals, parabens, or drying sulfates. Another ingredient is peppermint oil which I typically look for in hair care products because it has anti-inflammatory properties and stimulating effects. So, when you apply the Hair Lush thickening serum to your scalp it works to relieve dry, irritated skin and has a regenerative effect which stimulates hair growth. It also increases blood circulation to the scalp which promotes healthy hair growth and leaves it looking and feeling soft and fresh. Next, the product contains caffeine. Research has shown that applying caffeine-rich solutions to the scalp stimulates hair follicles and speeds up the production of new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Hair Lush to men and women seeking an easy to use solution to hair loss and thinning. It delivers noticeable results quickly and improves the overall health of the hair and scalp from root to tip.</li>
    <li> After years of looking for something that would help my hair from a bleach job gone bad I finally stumbled upon this! It works amazingly. After just about a week of using it I noticed my hair was thicker than it&#x27;s ever been. It has so much volume, feels thinker, and became so shiny. Before I would brush my hair and I can see all my ends just crack off. Now I brush it and there&#x27;s hardly any tangles at all. My favorite part about this is that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down or greasy. Also smells great!</li>
    <li> I have tried every product from this company and it really really worksI would recommend it to all my friends and fam great pricing and great product</li>
    <li> Finally found something to increase the fullness and thickness of my thinning hair.  Just when I was beginning to think it was hopeless, I tried this, and I didn&#x27;t have to wait months to see results, fast!  I have tried other products, and was leery of trying yet another product, but after being referred to this one, I am sold.  The ingredients used in this didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like some others, but instead left it feeling light and shiny.  A little goes a long way too, so it&#x27;ll last.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is experiencing thinning and lifeless hair.  With a small amount of this serum, you&#x27;ll notice results quickly.  This is now my new after-care product, and am now a loyal customer!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing,  I have been using it for the past weeek and I can feel a difference in my hair. The serum it self smells really good and nothing like a harsh chemicals. It feels fresh when applied to the scalp.  More than anything its so simple to use when you are getting ready it takes no longer than 30 seconds to apply plus a quick little run through your whole scalp. Not to mention that it leaves hair soft! Really a must have.</li>
    <li> I started with the ultrax shampoo and conditioner and absolutely loved it, so I just had to try this as well. A little bit goes a long way and gives my thickening hair a great shine without leaving it oily. I use it everyday. What amazed me is how fast this product works. I noticed a difference in my hair just after a few days of using it.</li>
    <li> Most of their reviews are clearly sponsored. This product doesn&#x27;t provide much volume- it does, however dry your hair out. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Leave this on after washing your hair  with the Ultrax Labs caffeine hair loss shampoo and the difference is noticeable within a few days. Hair loss can be devastating especially after washing your hair, but with this product you can breathe easy! The product comes in a nice, easy to use dispenser. The gel was easy to use and apply. I think the caffeine in this product really stimulates hair growth! It smells great and tingles a bit, but thats the case with most of the Ultrax products, you know its working!</li>
    <li> My hair has been really shedding and lying flat lately, and this product has really given my hair a boost!  I massage it into my scalp (on hair I washed the day before) and run my blow dryer over it.  Wow!  Great results in such a short time.  And it smells so fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> Hair Lush is the perfect name!&lt;br /&gt;My husband initially tried the shampoo &amp; conditioner from Ultrax with great results so he figured he would give the treatment a try.  He is noticing new hair growth and while he is hesitant, he is very excited about the results he is seeing with the shampoo, conditioner and now the thickening treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair and have tried it as well and my hair feels thicker and more manageable.  I can also see a noticeable difference.  You only need a very small amount as it is concentrated but it really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells great!</li>
    <li> Love this so much! Great buy after a bad hair cut!</li>
    <li> Awesome product , love that the conditioner is in with the shampoo so it leaves your hair soft.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent finishing product for the Ultrax shampoo &amp; conditioner combination. It is infused with caffeine, which is proven to speed up the hair growing process. It is a lightweight serum that will not weigh hair down,and perfect for all hair types. I have naturally oily hair for example, and it is great!  As with the other Ultrax products, you can feel a tingling sensation on your scalp after applying the product indicative that it is working. For me, the proof has been in a fuller head of hair, after struggling for years with hair loss. The serum can be used at any point, on either wet or dry hair, make sure to massage thoroughly into scalp.  This product line truly works, well worth a try if you struggle with hair loss or thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I love it! This would make my hair feel lush, thick and healthy again. It helped my thinning and hair loss.</li>
    <li> Having this product, along with the other products creates wonders for my hair. All of the other products are very good but this tops its all off. This hair lush is my product crush. If the other products didn&#x27;t make my hair thicker, this product definitely did the job. I love the immediate results in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t take long for your hair to get thicker after using this product just a few days after administrating it. Like the other products, it provides the same tingling sensation. When I feel that, I know something is happening. This a very good product for your hair. My hair has got so thick, others are beginning to notice. My hair is finally making great progress because of the hair growth product.</li>
    <li> The main ingredient in Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment Formula Serum is caffeine, which has been shown in clinical trials to promote hair growth. Additionally it contains keratin, which is the protein that covers the hair shaft. This product also contains biotin, vitamin B7, that is included in products promoted for strong hair and nails. The serum coats the hair and provides fullness and softness. The benefits of caffeine never cease to amaze me, as they will you.</li>
    <li> Worked nice, but didn&#x27;t seem practical for extended use.  The price went up dramatically from when I last purchased it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and my hair is noticeably thicker.  Ultrax Labs has definitely found an effective formula because this stuff stimulated my scalp to grow my hair thicker, fuller and faster. I think its really cool that it contains caffeine in it because when I rinse it out it seems to not only be very clean but awake and full of body afterwards. This has been making my hair grow faster and thicker. It sticks up now more and stands on end. I guess thats what they mean by thicker volume. I highly recommend this from Ultrax Labs</li>
    <li> I love it! It smells great and works really well!</li>
    <li> After trying Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo and being very happy with the results I decided to add the serum to my regime and can I say I was not disappointed! Feels like double improvement with both fullness and reduced loss. Very excited.</li>
    <li> The purchase of Ultrax hair products has assisted in the transformation of chemically damage hair to new natural healthy hair. Six times out of the year, I have spent $200 on braid extensions and hair weaves at the hair salon. In some cases, I had to purchase hair.&lt;br /&gt;The self-inflicted damages caused hair breakage, balding edges, excessive dandruff and scalp irritation. The first application of Surge shampoo made such a great impact, I was inspired to purchase Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx n Vitamin Supplement tablets, and Ultrax Labs Hair Lush.&lt;br /&gt;Within 30 days, I had 1/4 quarter inch of new hair growth; the breakage has stopped, and I have new growth in balding areas. My new growth is softer and has a great sheen. The purchase of all three products totaled less than $200 for over a 30 day supply.&lt;br /&gt;I especially enjoy the Ultrax Lab Hair Lush because it&#x27;s a leave in conditioner with a great scent. I hope this post inspire other African Americans and individuals with kinky hair to go natural.</li>
    <li> This serum can be applied to hair whether its wet or dry , I personally use it after I shampoo with the Ultra Labs shampoo with caffeine, the serum smells pleasant and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy but keep in mind a little goes a long way , I use this on my natural hair and it feels and looks rich and thick in conjunction with the shampoo I am excited and pleased with this product will recommend it to anyone wanting thicker healthier looking and feeling hair Ultra Labs products really works they stimulate growth and thicker amazing hair I am truly impressed about this line I repeat this is the real deal and most definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product is really unique.  I have baby fine blonde hair, and I was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t know how it would look in my hair (since you don&#x27;t rinse it out).  IMPRESSED!&lt;br /&gt;From first application there is a wonderful cooling sensation.  It is very refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;(not to mention the fact you gently massage it in 2xday, so your hair/ scalp are getting the benefits of the massage as well).&lt;br /&gt;The way it looks in my hair is perfect.  I don&#x27;t wear other thickening products when I use this, as this one allows my hair to feel a bit thicker in a natural way.  When I run my hands through my hair, it doesn&#x27;t feel like my hair is coated, yet my hair looks fuller.  The product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily nor tacky.  Just a nice healthy looking fullness.&lt;br /&gt;On the same note, you can use this with what ever products you want to and it doesn&#x27;t feel overdone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final wow factor - The ingredient list includes keratin, biotin, niacinamide,  and of course caffeine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with their caffeine shampoo and love it! I will probably spring for the conditioner too. I&#x27;m a woman and have always had thin hair; now it&#x27;s started falling out. These products are the only thing I&#x27;ve found that are really making a difference. They started to work after just a few weeks. Thanks, Ultrax!</li>
    <li> This product shipped immediately and within days my hair was feeling thicker. The caffeine really seems to work.</li>
    <li> I like the way this feels when I put on my hair, it has a refreshing feel to it. My hair is curly, and dry, but with the combination of the shampoo, conditioner, and lush, it looks so clean, shiny and healthy. I have been using this product, and do like  it.</li>
    <li> I see a result but not much as I expected so I&#x27;m not going to get another one</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It works well - I use it on my damp hair on my roots prior to blow drying.  I definitely find it helps with volume and it smells nice.  I am going through the product quickly and will have to re-order but definitely on the better end of Hair Thickeners.</li>
    <li> I have tried many shampoos, conditioners, and products to thicken my quickly thinning hair. I have been using this product for about 10 days and the results are better than anything else I have tried. I was recommended the Ultraxx products from a friend of mine, who happens to be a barber and has used it with great success, as well. The concentrated formula is very easy to use, and the caffeine gives an extra boost of energy (added bonus;). I am excited to try their other products, as these results have been amazing already. I highly recommend this to anyone with thinning brittle hair. I look and feel 10 years younger, and can finally stop wearing hats when I go out!</li>
    <li> This product worked wonders on my thin and sometimes easily greasy hair. I needed something that made it have more body but didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue behind. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> After the first use of Hair Lush, I noticed a difference, and after several uses, the change became more dramatic. That was when others noticed as well, and told me so. My hair has become fuller and each strand appears thicker. I’ve been trying different hair thickening products because my hair is often limp, lacking thickness, lacking luster and generally drab. After leaving Hair Lush in my hair, and on my scalp, it appears to have stimulated real hair growth, while also improving the quality of my hair. It doesn’t leave a residual film afterward. It is clean and very effective. I previously lost thickness in my hair, and now after applying Hair Lush, it appears my hair is returning to that thicker hair I used to know and love. I am experiencing a serious improvement in the quality of my hair. I will definitely continue using Hair Lush, a leave-in hair thickening serum, and I expect ongoing improvement and hair growth. I highly recommend Hair Lush. Toss out those other imposters. This product actually works.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in hopes of thickening my hair. It&#x27;s been only a week now and I can immediately tell the difference when I run my hands through it. My hair is fuller and thicker then ever before. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Do you want fuller, thicker, healthy hair?  Would you use a product that shows significant results in a short length of time? Do you wanna restore that full-bodied bounce that your hair once had? Well look no further, Ultrax Lab Hair Lush Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment Formula Serum is a leave in serum that does just that. It’s a product design for both men and women. Ultrax Lab Hair Lush promotes healthy hair growth, stops hair loss and the revolutionary caffeinated ingredients gives your hair that extra “kick” that it needs. It&#x27;s easy to use and works well with other hair products. Get the product and get your lush back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is thinning as I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s. While I still have a lot of hair, it&#x27;s thinning on the crown. Prior to this purchase, I bought the Ultrax Labs Caffeine Shampoo and love it; afterwards, I added the Ultrax Labs Hair Max supplements to help with the nutritional side of hair growth. I decided I needed a good product to help condition and style my hair after shampooing. I searched for a leave-in product that would help strengthen and thicken my hair and protect my hair when a dryer and curling iron. I&#x27;m happy with the Ultrax Labs hair products and found the brand&#x27;s Hair Lush Treatment had hundreds of happy customers. I&#x27;m very pleased that it&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave any gooey residue, like some leave-in treatments can feel (of course, you need to follow the directions and not glob your hair with this product). For me, I think I have a great treatment plan of hair growth products to help grow my hair, so it&#x27;s thicker, fuller and shinier than it has looked in years. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! It makes my hair feel really clean and also gives a little tingle! I see growth occurring already and its only been a few weeks. Great product and well worth the money!</li>
    <li> This treatment has helped my hair become thicker, fuller and overall more healthy. It has helped with hair loss in certain areas and I was able to see results quickly. It has a good smell to it which is important for a leave in serum. This is a great treatment because being a leave in serum, once its on you don&#x27;t have to worry about rinsing it out. It also works through your hair throughout the day. I have used this constantly and love it!  It is a Great Purchase!!</li>
    <li> As with the other products I have used from Ultrax Labs, I am very impressed. This is a very lightweight product, smells great but not overly strong, and definitely works. There is a light, tingly feel when you first apply it. Unlike some similar products, it does not leave the hair feeling greasy or weighed down.  It leaves your hair soft and shiny, very healthy looking. One thing I noticed, this seems to provide a LOT more impact on instant body when used as a styling product with a blow drier, rather than allowing the hair to dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;As with many product lines, you will see much better results when using many products, rather than just one. Also, not all products will work for all people. I have had to try several different products, and have found that this product line works for me. I have been very pleased with the results I have seen, as well as with the quality of the products. Definitely worth trying the line, and seeing for yourself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE! I absolutely love this product. I am also a user of the shampoo and this product just adds to the amazing results that I am seeing. My hair feels like it did when I was back in high school, prechemical days (my hair was thicker, shinier, and bouncier). I am telling all of my friends about this product and I will definitely be buying again</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning for a few years now.  I decided to give this product a try to see if it would make a difference with my scalp and if it helped grow those hairs back.  I am really happy to say that I can see those hairs re growing slowly and my hair is getting thicker.  It&#x27;s a slow process, but I am actually seeing great results and am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush serum works wonderfully in combination with their shampoo and conditioner.  I really like that it’s a leave-in product and can be used on wet or dry hair.  Just follow the instructions, use a small amount each day and you will start to notice a difference in the appearance of your hair in only a short time.  Hair Lush smells good, is not sticky like some other products, and leaves my hair feeling more manageable.  I recommend giving Ultrax Labs Hair Lush a try, especially when used with their Hair Surge shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> No build up feel and instant thickness!&lt;br /&gt;I was really amazed by this product&lt;br /&gt;I love the shine, great results and easy use.&lt;br /&gt;A keeper!!!</li>
    <li> All the superb past reviews have been spot on about this product, it works like a charm! I&#x27;ve always had very very fine and thin hair, and struggled to maintain a full head of hair or to keep volume. This product really does increase the thickness of each strand of hair and works to increase hair growth, and a very noticeable change and I will be using this product for a long time coming!</li>
    <li> I couldn’t wait to start using it after reading the other fantastic reviews. I&#x27;ve tried a few products here and there since I started to notice thinning on the top part of my head.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy and convenient to use any time and also has a very nice scent and a light feel. It made my hair feel thick and fuller, I wish I would have started using &amp;#34;Growth serum by Ultrax labs&amp;#34; much sooner. This product is definitely one of the best hair growth serum currently in market. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am currently using this product and my hair has grown like crazy. Sofar i love it...</li>
    <li> Been using this for about two weeks now. My hair was noticeably thicker after the 3rd application, which is what I expected, and my hair is actually still continuing to thicken! Now, about 2 weeks in, I was really curious to see if the part of the hair closest to my head is growing out thicker than before, and IT IS! So this formula is working on the entire strand of the hair, not just the part above your head. Exactly what I needed! Just ordered another bottle, as this one will probably run out by the time the next one arrives.</li>
    <li> My hair was so thin and was breaking all the time and I thought I tried everything (and so did my wallet), but when I tried this product my hair thickened and seemed much healthier within the month! It is amazing and I will continue to use this. I love this product and I will recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> It smells OK, not too medicinal but not too sweet. After using it my hair feels strong and smooth, not too frizzy. It does feel thicker than it typically does so I am happy with that. This is a good option once you are ok with Leave-Ins and have some patience.</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;Leave-In&amp;#34; serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty light, I have long hair and there is one area on the crown of my head that seems to be thinner than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I style my hair, the right side just flops, while the left is limp and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I found this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it help- now, it is doing stuff to treat your hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loves</li>
    <li> I love this product. This product really works. I hope to use this again</li>
    <li> This will make your hair healthier and thicker almost instantly. Just a little each time after my wash does wonders&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair and want it to look its best or else what would be the point in having it. This product does just that&lt;br /&gt;exactly Look your best with a healthy head of hair and smells great too&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Ultrax Labs for another great product job well done</li>
    <li> This product was heaven sent. Great purchase , I highly recommend it to everybody trying to grow their hair back</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have struggled with breakage around my hairline and dry brittle ends. When i blow-dry  my hair it looked so think and brittle. I have found hair lush and its making a big difference. I apply this right after i wash my hair when its still wet. It really adds volume, moisturizes it and it smells amazing. I suggest using a little bit until you find the amount that works for you. A little goes a long way. Also decreased my shedding quite a bit!</li>
    <li> Recently i have noticed that my hair is not thick as it used to be. I have done some research and i found this great product. I can see that my pony tail got thicker and my hair glows with a natural shine, i cannot express my happiness.</li>
    <li> As getting older, my hair is thinning and coming off more, and my hair is naturally flat and thin.. I&#x27;ve been desperate to keep my hair and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair restoration products from cheaper ones to expensive stuff, but I think this will be it.  I recently bought this serum after I really fell in love with the Ultrax Caffeine shampoo that worked as well. I think I&#x27;m becoming a fan of Ultrax products and I also wanted to try this serum what it will do after using the shampoo. I can clearly feel my hair is even thicker, stronger, and healthier although I only use a small amount of this serum. I think the bottle will last a few months. I had been looking for real results like this, so I am fully satisfied.</li>
    <li> Hair lush worked wonders. It minimized my shedding as well as providing me with a head of voluminous, soft healthy looking hair. I could not be happier with the results after using this product. I shed like a dog-- something I attributed to having coarse dry curly hair. Unmanageable to say the least. Over the last few years I noticed my ponytail holders were getting smaller..my hair was thinning!! I took a leap of faith on Hair Lush..boy am I happy I did!!  After using the serum my hair has a beautiful healthy shine to it without any of the oily/slickness other serums provide. I now have a gorgeous head of bouncy, shiny HEALTHY weightless curls.My hair feels thicker, looks better and my hair brush no longer requires me to clean it daily! A dime sized amount of this product goes a long way. I have an oily scalp paired with really dry curls, a combination that has left me with one too many barely used serum bottles in the past. This will be the last anti hair thinning product you will ever use. Promise.</li>
    <li> I read great things about Ultrax Hair Lush Thickening Serum but was concerned that it might be sticky or gooey like another serum I tried (from a different company). Much to my surprise and pleasure, it was not; it blended smoothly into my hair. It&#x27;s a small bottle that goes a long way. You only need the tiniest bit each day to get amazing results. My thinning hair now has volume and bounce. I use it with Ultrax shampoo and conditioner and my hair is the fullest and healthiest it&#x27;s ever been. I highly recommend it if you have thinning hair like me!</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this serum.  I have had thick wavy unmanageable hair most of my life, especially since I started coloring it. However, until a Keratin treatment a few months ago, I had a lot of it.  After the Keratin treatment, my hair started falling out.  I&#x27;ve been using Ultra Products for 2 months now.  Serum has always been a main staple in my hair care.  Now, my goals are different, both manage the frizz and help it look fuller.  Hair Lush does both.  It leaves absolutely no sticky residue, and it makes my hair look the way I thought only a trip to the hairdresser would look.  It&#x27;s smooth, feels great, and adds a little bounce.  It is amazing that it&#x27;s not sticky because it really does add a look of volume.  I highly recommend this product, and the Ultra line in general if you have hair loss.  I like this serum so much that I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends who don&#x27;t even have a hair loss problem.</li>
    <li> I wish that I could give this product a good review. After seeing all of the positive reviews, I was so excited! After turning 40, the hair around my face began to &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; out a little. So, I was looking for something to regrow the hair and to thicken up the hair that was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used almost the entire bottle (which for the price is very, very tiny), concentrating solely on my hairline. I have seen absolutely NO difference what-so-ever. I am glad it worked for some, but did absolutely nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of money spent for no improvement.</li>
    <li> As a girl who used to get lots of compliments on her once thick, lush hair, I was heartbroken to be diagnosed with alopecia which leaves me with lots of hair loss issues.  After having tried several products by Ultralax and really feeling a great difference, I thought I&#x27;d try this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I started using the serum, people who haven&#x27;t seen me in a while tell me my &amp;#34;salon blowout&amp;#34; looks awesome.  Most of these compliments have come from men!!! Even my brother&#x27;s girlfriend&#x27;s mom, who is a hairstylist, noticed my hair over Christmas and asked &amp;#34;who&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been seeing to get my hair &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; because it looks fabulous!!!  I can&#x27;t believe how much of a difference this serum makes...it especially helps if you use a great paddle brush (like Aveda&#x27;s) to fluff up your hair.</li>
    <li> After trial and error with at least four different products my search has finally come to an end. This is the best hair product yet. Not only does it kept my hair moisturized I can see it growing back in the spots on top of my head.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I have lost faith in all hair loss/hair growth products  UNTIL I tried the Ultrax Labs Hair Lush - Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment Formula Serum - with this product my faith in hair loss/hair growth products has been restored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been in the process of losing my hair since my early twenties, due to the  daily abuse that I put it through, from chemically treating it to regularly&lt;br /&gt;straightening it to even gluing hair extensions in my hair and losing an  enormous amount of hair when I took them out. However, the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back with my hair loss was my pregnancy - after having a child I  couldn&#x27;t even wear my hair down because running my fingers through my hair would  cause me to lose about 15 hairs every time. I would be mortified when I had to wash my hair because the amount of hair that was in the tub was probably enough to make a wig out of it. My hair was literally shedding EVERYWHERE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While other products take weeks and sometimes months to see results, from the first time I used this product I saw immediate results! Ever since I began using this product my hair feels thicker and fuller. In addition, this product has accelerated my hair growth... I can see baby hairs beginning to grow around my hairline. Furthermore, when I go shower now or brush my hair I notice a considerably less amount of hair falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this product is that it can literally be used at any time of the day and the size of the bottle of serum is perfect, making it easily transportable - you can just put it in your purse and put the serum in on your way to work or when you get to work. Compared to other serums, this product does not leave your hair feeling oily, greasy, or weighed down - instead, it leaves your hair feeling soft, shiny and healthy. In addition, while the other serums cause your hair to harden or clump up, this product doesn&#x27;t - the serum goes on clear, isn&#x27;t even noticeable, is lightweight and applies easily. Also, to go along with the fact that the product applies easily, all you need is one pump of the serum and run it though your hair, so the product lasts you at least a few months. Furthermore, unlike other serums, this product has a very light pleasant scent, nothing overly fragrant. Finally, the price of this product is definitely cheaper than the other serums I have bought, from which I didn&#x27;t even see any results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product, which is completely safe to use, and I don&#x27;t even have 1 bad thing to say about it - my hair has never been this thick, full, strong and healthy. This product helped me save my hair and I will continue using it and recommending it to others!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for awhile and have definitely noticed a healthier look and feel to my hair.  It is thicker and fuller that it has been in a long time.  The bounce and shine are salon quality!  I will definitely purchase another bottle before this one runs out!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Ultrax Hair lush as part of my new haircare regimen.  Yes I was apprehensive of the whole concept but Ultrax completely changed my Outlook after I saw and people noticed the almost instant hair growth and thickness after less then a week of use!! The Hair lush completes my regimen beautifully and there is no weigh down or greasy residue. This is a must buy for both Men and women.</li>
    <li> Easy ordering, quick shipping and nice packaging. This is my 3rd product from ultra labs. Bottle is larger then I thought, good amount of product for price paid. Looking forward to using this in conjunction with shampoo and vitamins. Smells good and feels like a serum, I will benefit most using this when blow drying straight.</li>
    <li> This is a great finishing product, my hair appears much thicker and no more fly aways.  I was impressed with the appearance of fuller hair immediately after using. It&#x27;s a lightweight serum that gives my hair a healthy shine without heaviness or build up. My hair is growing again and styling with ease.</li>
    <li> I love the Ultrax Labs Hair Lush treatment serum. I noticed results immediately after using it for the first time. I felt a tingling sensation on my scalp and it increased the thickness of each strand of my hair. This is a convenient leave in formula that stimulates hair growth and minimizes hair loss. The bottle has an easy to use pump and you only need a few squirts! It is nice to find a product that works so well.</li>
    <li> Do you know that feeling when one of your friends compliments your hair, or asks you what you have done lately to change your looks because they just see an improvement in you, but aren&#x27;t sure what it is that you did. They will ask you if you cut your hair or are you on a new diet? That&#x27;s what I have been hearing after about 3 weeks of using this product, I am getting compliments and being asked what I did to change my looks and attitude since I appear younger. Then I tell them it&#x27;s my hair, it&#x27;s fuller, more body, shinier and no split ends. That&#x27;s when they really see the difference and ask me where am I getting my hair treatment from and how can I afford it! That&#x27;s when I tell them it&#x27;s Ultrax Labs Lush and that they can find it on Amazon! Hey, I was skeptical at first when my cousin let me in on his secret with using Ultrax Labs products and I decided to try it. Well I am now using a couple of different products at different times and I am finding results that I love. Thank you Ultrax Labs!</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff!! Works well with any other shampoo! Especially the Ultrax Labs Hair Growth Shampoo! I will continue to recommend this product to people!</li>
    <li> I love this Ultrax Labs product. You can feel it tingle on your scalp and you know that its going to work and doing what it needs too. I would recommend using this product if you want great thicker beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a week and I am so happy with the results!  My hair is usually brittle and thin but has been noticeably thicker and fuller after the first use.  The serum has a great smell and I love the way it made my scalp tingle - indicative, I hope, of promoting new hair growth.  It is a very light serum and does not weigh my hair down or leave a sticky residue, in fact it left my hair smooth, shiny and bouncy!  A really good quality product and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> As far as my experience goes, Ultrax Labs sets the industry standard in hair restoration products. This Hair Lush formula adds to their excellent line-up - including the Ultrax hair thickening shampoo and conditioner - to yield sensationally fast and LASTING results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, the Lush feels great to use. It has a nice, lightweight texture - no gooey or gunky mess - and feels great upon application. It&#x27;s difficult to describe the feeling; perhaps the best way to put it is that you simply feel &#x27;healthy&#x27; with regards to your hair and scalp while and after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second benefit is that the Lush smells fantastic. Unlike some other products I&#x27;ve tried in this category, there&#x27;s no need to use anything else to cover up some toxic smell. The Lush carries a pleasant natural scent for which I&#x27;ve even received several compliments! Because you leave it in throughout the day, the scent lasts and also leaves your hair feeling great all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally - and most importantly - this product WORKS. With daily application, I&#x27;ve experienced almost immediate and progressive regeneration. My hair is thicker, sheds less, and generally just feels better and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price may seem high from first glance, but the bottle lasts long enough to make this a truly great bargain. Give it a try, you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> This hair serum is great because it can be used at anytime during the day.  There&#x27;s no need to use this in the shower, so you can carry it along with you in your purse or pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is clear and applies easily, just squeeze some out and massage it into your hair.  It goes on clear and does not cause your hair to harden or clump up like many other products.  It has a light scent, nothing too fragrant or overwhelming.  It smells minty since one of the main ingredients is peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to moisturize well with conditioner during the period you use this, as it can cause your hair to dry out a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed at how much body this adds to my hair.  My locks look a lot healthier since I have been using Ultrax.  I am going to continue using this, and am looking forward to continued results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month now and I can see a visible difference in my hair. It&#x27;s much thicker and grows faster. The serum has a slight tingling sensation when applied, but that just shows that it&#x27;s working. Works even better when used with the shampoo too.</li>
    <li> Product does seem to have made the hair at my temples fuller.  Also seems to have had an effect on eyebrows.  Will definitely keep using.</li>
    <li> Thank You Hair Lush! No more limp thinning hair! I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time and am thrilled with the results. My hair has life again!</li>
    <li> I love the tingling these products create on your scalp, so you know it&#x27;s working. I noticed a difference especially in the front of my head, where it&#x27;s the worst I think it&#x27;s doing something. I will continue to use them and evaluate later if need be. The products thicken the existing thinning parts of my hair and hope to see more from the tingling caffeine sensation you get.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush is AMAZING! Unfortunately, I have been blessed with super thin hair, and this hair lush is a little miracle in a bottle! My hair automatically gets thicker and looks fuller! I am very happy with this product and reccomend anyone who want some fullness to their hair to buy this ASAP!</li>
    <li> No hair growth so far.&lt;br /&gt;Still hoping!</li>
    <li> This product goes right along with the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo. With using the both of them together, my hair has never been more softer, thicker, and healthier. But the most important thing to me was to grown my hair back and this product certainly helps with that. I definitely recommend this product! I am a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was using the pills and shampoo from this company to begin with, as a lengthening treatment, and decided the serum might be a nice try to help topically make my hair thicker and stronger. At first I was skeptical about using a hair serum, I usually stay away from serums as I think of it as a greasy styling product, but this one was way different and improved my thickness so quickly!  It&#x27;s amazing how three simple products can change your hairs appearance so fast! I&#x27;m excited to have nice full, thick and healthy hair before the holidays! My hat hair breakage has also been noticably less too!</li>
    <li> This is the kind of product I am looking for in the market---one that’s safe and effective, can prevent hair loss, boosts hair growth kind of all in one gel.  The feel and smell are good.  I feel the hair really clean and see a tinge to it.  I am satisfied with the product and I would recommend the same to anybody who ever is interested in.</li>
    <li> Does give volume. Does not make hair dull or sticky. Hair feels very natural. Do NOT put more than 1 pump. I put like 5 first time, and my hair turned greasy.. I think this bottle will last forever. Love it.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Caffeine Thickening Treatment Formula is a great way to finish the hair strengthening process. It works well with the shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and to rinse out.  The serum has a nice scent and my hair feels stronger and softer.</li>
    <li> ok, i just received it, and only used it one time, so i can not commend on its hair growth powers. but i tell you that 50$ seems to much already and that i pumped and pumped until my fingers hurt and only a little squirt came out the dispenser...i dont know if mine is broken or if that is the way it is supposed to be but for 50$ i expect more. But if I will grow more hair, which i dont know yet, i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> After the several times I&#x27;ve used it, I began to see the effect it has on my hair. While it&#x27;s too early to say if it will help with regrowing my hair, I must admit that the thinning portion of my hair has become noticeably thicker. The serum feels like it works as soon as it is applied and it is not too greasy. It has helped so much because it has made my thin hair follicles thicker and fill in the gaps between the hair strands covering up balding spots. It has been a useful product so far. Will wait a few weeks to see if it helps with the regrowth of my hair.</li>
    <li> Because I have really short &amp; fine hair, I only need a dobble and my hair immediately has a fullness that feels and looks like a healthy  full and thick head of hair. If I blow dry my hair, it&#x27;s even thicker and fuller. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This product from Ultrax works great!&lt;br /&gt;I wear my hair up in a ponytail a lot for work, which over time had left my hair a little thinner in one area on my head. This treatment has worked wonders for me with that. I can wear my hair down now, &amp; it looks beautiful! My hair is much fuller, &amp; it feels great!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell it has done anything.  Full of alcohol and it evaporates fast when applied- not sure what is left behind.  Still hopeful so two stars till future review.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working great along with the vitamins I am taking. Fast hair growth</li>
    <li> Well i have to say i\\&quot;ve been so impressed with this entire line of products and after just two months of use I&#x27;ve seen a significant change in the thickness and shine of my hair. After years of disappointment with other products I&#x27;ve been so happy to find this line. I look forward to see where my hair could go from here. Being able to style and brush my hair without fear of fallout or disappointment in how it looked this has TRUELY changed how I feel about myself. I had thinning areas near the front of my hair, also around my face and anytime j wore my hair back in the pony tail I was always self conscious. Now I&#x27;ve seen a real difference and feeling more confident!!    Was this review helpful?</li>
    <li> Love this product! Especially the leave in conditioner aspect to it. I feel like it helps the overall strengthening of my hair by not washing it right out. I already use the ultralax hair strengthening caffeine shampoo so this leave in product is a good addition to my already exisisting hair strengthening regimen.</li>
    <li> Wow, thank goodness I found this Serum. I have been using their Shampoo/Conditioner and this just makes the results blossom. The Serum feels good, and I can tell within days that my hair follicles are growing. These are the 3 products to use and Ultrax is the winner. I am blown away by these results and by their formula for success. Thinning hair for me, as a woman out there in the dating world, was not something I felt confident about. Thinning hair made me feel old. Now I feel young, and happy, and feel confident to let people get close. Nothing to hide anymore.</li>
    <li> Wow!! is all I can say about this product.  I recently started using this and my hair has never felt or shine as it does not.  I have thinning hair that was falling out.  I started using this company&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner, and now the Ultrax Labs Hair Lush is awesome.  My hair is always fuller and thicker.  I get many complements and always asked what I am using.  It does not make your hair oily or sticky like some other products.  Easy to use pump, and all you need a is very small amount and apply to your hair. You want results, than give Ultrax Labs Hair Lush thickening serum a try and you will also see for yourself.</li>
    <li> This thickening serum is one of the best ones I have ever used. My hair is pretty thin and limp, but after using this product my hair has never been so thick and voluminous. It smells great too! I love how it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy, like some other products. I will definitely be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> After trying this product my hair is significantly thicker. I cant see any of my thinning spots that were through my hair originally. It&#x27;s easy to use and equally easy to love.</li>
    <li> smells great, hydrating and prevents hair loss.  does not help grow hair from what i&#x27;ve noticed but definitely see less hair loss.  only drawback is the expensive price</li>
    <li> I love how much my hair has grown from using this product. My family and friends even notice the difference.</li>
    <li> First thing is first - I want to thank the people who created such a wonderful and supportive product, The Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Caffeine Thickening Treatment Formula / Serum has saved my life and I can never see myself going backwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Caffeine Thickening Treatment Formula / Serum one day on the internet while trying to find something new and different since I had already exhausted so many other products over the years with absolutely no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My life hasn’t been the same since I have been using Ultrax Labs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been struggling since my late 20s with thinning hair due to androgenic alopecia and I am 47 now. I wished it to be a medical issue that could cured with a simple pill – but that was not the case for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Caffeine Thickening Treatment Formula Serum has been designed to bring out the best in your hair, it also increase the thickness of each hair strand for a fuller, thicker looking head of hair and I have to say I went from bald to full head of hair. There special break through caffeine innovation technology provides optimum hair thickening and some seriously long lasting benefits. Leave in caffeine formulation increases hair growth while minimizing hair loss with each and every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and stand by it 100%, don’t be the elephant In the room when you show up wearing a hat or some type of disguise for your head so your friends and family don’t see your baldness.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this time I feel like I have to share my experience and take extra step to recommend this product to others.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product without any expectations, I am not the person who reads reviews or spends a lot of time trying to find the best of the best. I bought this serum because it popped up on the first page and I still could use my regular shampoo to which I used to. Again, I had no expectations, just got it to make myself feel better knowing that I do something about my problem. I used it every day as directed applying after the shower or before styling my hair each morning, sometimes I skipped a day or two, but  not really often.&lt;br /&gt;So I used it for some time and next time when I went to my hair stylist he stated that I have new hair popping out. He said that quality of my hair have improved a little and I have some new hair growing. And he&#x27;s been my only barber for years so he really can see if something changes.&lt;br /&gt;Now I really can see the results, I am so happy with my hair and really thinking of getting other hair loss treatment products of this company.&lt;br /&gt;And now I never skip a single day applying this serum. It really worked for me. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After years of bleaching, my hair is very dry and damaged and some areas have hair loss/breakage. This product has definitely helped my hair grow back thicker and fuller. It works very well but it takes a while to see results. You have to use it daily for a couple of weeks. You only need a small amount, so one bottle lasts a while. This also will help your split ends if you have long hair. It also helps my hair stay shiny and frizz-free. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Hair Lush makes my hair LUSH again!! :D I have had thinning hair issues ever since I had chemo a few years ago, and so the texture of my hair has changed, that is until I tried this product! After using it for about 10 days, I started noticing improvement, so I will toss all the other products that touted thicker hair, but were just good at cleaning my hair but did nothing for it. Nothing worked until I tried this product from this company. I don&#x27;t have to use much, so it seems to be long lasting as well, and smells good to boot! Try it you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Ultrax Hair Growth shampoo and conditioner and this serum is the perfect combination.  The product is very concentrated so a little goes a long way so the bottle will last me quite a while. I was afraid it was going to be sticky but it is super easy to apply to the hair with no scalp itchiness.  I use a wide tooth comb to distribute evenly through the hair and it can be applied on wet or dry hair which I love.  It&#x27;s added  a ton of texture to my limp hair so I no longer need to use a texturizing spray.  I also use the Ultrax  Hair Growth supplements, so I feel the combination of all 4 products has greatly improved the health and texture of my hair.  So excited to discover this product.</li>
    <li> It dries out my scalp and it didn&#x27;t seem to reduce my hair fall out. You&#x27;ll get through the bottle in less than 2 weeks. Not going to buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it when my hair is damp and It leaves my hair feeling and looking full without the residue. It smells good too. Definetly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My thinning hair issues have been much less noticeable since using this product. I have had good success with Ultrax Labs other products so I thought I would give this a go and I was not disappointed. The richer, fuller look to my hair since I started using this has been amazing. My friends and co-workers have even noticed. I would highly recommend this product to anybody having issues with thinning hair. I am a true believer in this treatment.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair lush and tried it for more than 2 months and no changes !! I have bought it based on the reviews and I believe the reviews are fake !</li>
    <li> This is a great product will buy again. It really makes my hair fuller.</li>
    <li> Great product, used it to add volume.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Caffeine Thickening Treatment Formula Serum bring out the best in my  hair. It  Increased the thickness of my hair for a fuller, thicker looking head of hair.I also use the Ultrax shampoo that combination I can see a difference it my not be a revolutionary change but it&#x27;s significant Break through caffeine innovation technology provides optimum hair thickening long lasting benefits. Leave in caffeine formulation increases hair growth while minimizing hair loss. I would recommend to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money. I had issues with thinning hair for awhile and had tried other products with minimal results. I decided to spend the money and try this product and after 5-6  days noticed a difference. Most of the other products that I tried were sticky and felt heavy on my hair and scalp but not this one - it is very light, not sticky or heavy and it does not leave a build up on your scalp. You need to follow the instructions and massage it into your scalp for best results. I use it after using the shampoo and conditioner. I was impressed. It&#x27;s a remarkable product and worth trying!</li>
    <li> Caffeine has been the only thing that noticeably works on my hair. Ever since I discovered Ultrax Lab products I&#x27;ve been hooked. I started off with the shampoo, moved onto the conditioner followed by supplements, and now this serum is the cherry on top! People have noticed the fullness of my hair, including my mom and hair stylist. I&#x27;ve always struggled with volume and had so little hair to where it&#x27;d only take a few minutes for me to blow dry my whole head. Just the other day I was modeling for my company&#x27;s clothing line and the photographer said, &amp;#34;Boy do you have a lot of hair.&amp;#34; My family is envious of how great my hair looks now. It seems thicker, fuller and healthier than ever. I just dyed my hair blonde but have noticed the ends are not dry nor am I leaving hair on the floor or on my brushes. I use the serum twice a day, once at night and once in the morning after I shower. I massage it through my scalp then onto the ends of my hair. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product plus the shampoo and conditioner for better results!</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my mother because like many other women her age, her hair isnt what it used to be and it has been thinning and falling out somewhat. This product is fabulous, it has helped her tremendously, her hair is so much thicker and not falling out nearly as much anymore. Not only is it a great product, but it is easy to use! Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this item on December 31st 2014 and today is January 15th 2015 and the bottle is empty ! It&#x27;s a scam, only fake reviews, and the product is completely inefficient !</li>
    <li> I’ve been using shampoo and conditioner along with Ultrax Thickening Treatment for 3 weeks now. As a result my hair has become noticeably thicker and healthier. No scalp irritation by the way! What’s more important – my husband used it and it worked for him. We noticed new hair growing in front! Generally it takes time, you can’t get with luxurious hair overnight. But this product works and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it is going to do. It really helps to thicken the hair for a fuller head of hair. This product in combination with the ultrax labs shampoo is the key to healthier hair.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush is the real deal! It definitely does what it says. My hair started thinning out a a few years ago and because of that i always wore my hair very low. I didnt like that look so I deciced to grow my hair back. I searched fore products to thickened my hair so i won&#x27;t look so bald and came across this amazing product. I have noticed results in 2-3 weeks. It makes my hairline look sharper than ever. Thanks Ultrax Labs. Good Job!</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hair started to fall out in excessive amounts with all the stress from college. The fact that it&#x27;s leave in makes it a lot easier to work with especially on days that you run late. Just with a few uses I saw my hair drastically improve and strengthen.</li>
    <li> This is probly the hair prodect in the WORLD !! I have been using in it for so long now ,  I recommend it !!! The price WORTH IT !!! Believe me !</li>
    <li> I have only used one bottle(waiting on the second bottle) so far,yes when you first use Hair Lush you feel the tingling sensation and the same goes for  Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo and so many other hair growth products but after a few uses the &amp;#34;Tingling Sensation&amp;#34; slowly disappears,it&#x27;s like the scalp is telling you &amp;#34;is that best you got&amp;#34;. I am 56 I have tried many,many Hair Growth down through years and have spend a lot of money on many different products I have come conclusion there is NO SUCH THING HAS A HAIR GROWTH PRODUCT out there sadly. I hope someday somewhere somebody or some company will come up will the &amp;#34;mracle&amp;#34; cure</li>
    <li> It seems like a lot of the bad reviews for this product treated this as a shampoo rather than what it is, which is a serum to be applied AFTER washing your hair, it&#x27;s not meant to be a full fledged shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Ultrax, if you think you are going to go from 1 hair on your head to looking like a full afro or something like that, then you are probably mistaken. I used this product to thicken my hair so it&#x27;d have a little fuller look, and it worked as promised. I didn&#x27;t have big expectations, but I did expect to see something.</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning since I got out of college, due to both stress and excessive bleaching. After using this product, I&#x27;m seeing both immediate and long term improvement in thickness. Also, my hair has stopped falling out in the excessive way that it was before. My mom, who has hair loss due to aging has been using this as well and has seen improvements. Try it out for yourself.</li>
    <li> I had come across this product from a friend who was also using the Ultrax Hair surge caffeine shampoo and she said that it was great product to use for styling after washing as it leaves the hair smooth without the greasy, sticky weighted feel you can get with other serums/sheen/pomades.I have tried it yesterday after washing my hair with the Ultrax shampoo and do like the clean soft feel the product leaves. As others have said, you do not need much, just a drop will do as it works through the hair easily. I have a cowlick which is prominent when I pull up my hair and this product seems to tame that tough spot leaving a more even hairline in front. I have also my hair to be smoother and thicker as I am using the products, I guess some of these products do work after all. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Purchased this about two years ago when the keratin thermal treatments got really popular I hopped on board. I was fighting against my naturally thick frizzy curls and nothing was working. I do not straighten my hair so I needed something that would work and not require heat in an attempt at preventing breakage. On a whim I ordered UL&#x27;s thickening serum but wasn&#x27;t really expecting much. However to my surprise I could instantly see an improvement. My hair was not only bouncy and full, but you could no longer see my scalp. If you are struggling with thin hair I am confident you will love this product.</li>
    <li> i received it last week but i&#x27;m afraid to use after using the Ultrax Growth Shampoo...</li>
    <li> It makes me lose more hair. The reviews are probably fake. Save your money, save your hair.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with thinning hair for several years. Like many of you, I have spent hundreds on products that were touted as a cure for thinning hair. I was skeptical, but decided to give this product a try after experiencing wonderful results with the Ultras Labs Hair Surge Stimulating Shampoo. I used this product, and experienced almost immediate results. My hair was shinier, bouncier, and more manageable. After using for a few days, my hair was noticeably thicker, and there was no oily residue. As a matter of fact, the more I used the product, the better the results. And you only need a dime sized amount for each application, so one container will last you for quite a while. I absolutely love this treatment, and I would recommend it to anyone with thinning and brittle hair!</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a couple weeks now and really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my hair :/ maybe I&#x27;m not using enough or need to give it more time!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the 5 stars reviews. Well, honstly speaking, there is no effect on my hair at all. After one week of usage, half bottle is gone. I think those reviews are paid by the company. I am quite disappointed. If you want to waste your money, go ahead. I also bought the sampoo and conditioner. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference either.</li>
    <li> I read so many good reviews about this Ultrax Hair Lush that I decided to buy it. I serious don&#x27;t know where all the good reviews come from because this thing did absolutely nothing for me. It was a complete waste of 50 dollars for me. I used it completely, saw no results at all, and now I know that buying this is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The Ultralax Labs hair serum is a superior brand.  And it does have a thickening effect.  My hair is very fine but now my hair always looks fuller and thicker than before.  Also, my hair has been thinning because my hair would fall every time I brush my hair.  But now I don&#x27;t get clumps of hair on my brush anymore!</li>
    <li> The tube is so small. I used it in one week and saw no difference even though I kept using the pills.</li>
    <li> This serum really works, it&#x27;s made my thinning hair, stronger, fuller and thicker. It didn&#x27;t happen overnight, but I persisted and my hair has stopped breaking off and is actually bouncy now. Thank u Ultra Labs.</li>
    <li> Very little product for a substantial amount of money. Not impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> This is the third product I&#x27;ve used from Ultrax and am very satisfied. I noticed results within a few short weeks and have maintained the regrowth. Hair loss can be extremely frustrating and expensive so it&#x27;s nice to finally find something that works for me. I will definitely be re ordering!</li>
    <li> One thing I can say about Ultrax Lab products is that they work! This particular product will leave your hair bouncy and feeling thicker than before. Plus as a bonus it even smells good:)</li>
    <li> After my pregnancy, after about 2 months post partum, my hair was falling out a lot. I tried vitamins and shampoos and a couple of things have worked. This works well too!  I am not shedding as much as i have been in the past.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mother who was experiencing some hair thinning with age. She was hesitant at first but agreed to try it. After about two weeks or so, she couldn&#x27;t help but be quite pleased with how well it worked and how relatively inexpensive it was. She also told me she was pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t leave her hair feeling too gooey or sticky. She is going to continue use to see further results. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This Lush serum is very helpful for thin or fragile hair! I like that it does not leave hair feeling oily or greasy. It is a smooth serum that is easy to apply. It doesn&#x27;t just make your hair feel thicker, it actually helps it become thicker and stronger!</li>
    <li> Not sure if the pump works correctly.  I pressed, pressed, pressed, and it barely comes out.</li>
    <li> This product has helped so much in the lasts few months.  I started to notice just a little thinning the top of my head and with just a month of use I noticed there was no more hair loss.  I&#x27;ve been trying lots of things and all of the products I&#x27;ve tried from this brand are really solid.</li>
    <li> Best single hair growth product..</li>
    <li> After trying Ultrax’s shampoo and liking the results, I decided to give their serum a try in order to keep my hair looking and feeling thicker. So far everything’s pretty amazing. It also does not make my hair feel greasy like other products I have tried in the past. Whoever said shaving your head was the only other option has not tried these products.</li>
    <li> I live for a good leave - in product. This Serum is light weight and not sticky. It allows for flexibility in styling with blow dryer or hot irons. I&#x27;ve also used the product as a finishing gloss as it gives a full and lustrous appearance to all hair types. This is the perfect topping to Ultrax Labs growth stimulating shampoo and conditioner. I noticed immediate results.</li>
    <li> Gives a tingling sensation like the shampoo. So far, so good. The serum does not weigh my hair down, and I&#x27;m noticing new growth already.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! My hair started falling because I get my hair done every other week  applying a perm on my hair well that being said. I used this product, and it works after a few applications. I&#x27;m always skeptical with my hair because not everything works some products are useless. Now, after using this product a lot my  is coming back and it&#x27;s thicker than  every before. I love ultrax labs and their products now FINALLY that I found something that works in  I will stay a customer forever! NO MORE THIN HAIR THANK YOU ULTRAX LABS!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair lush for only a short time now and WOW, what a difference!!! First of, I have straight black hair that is pretty lifeless and with all the hair iron straightening, it&#x27;s not shiny or healthy looking and I have split ends. My hair was a mess if I don&#x27;t use the Hair Lush. Now I use it everyday and my hair is smooth, shiny, more healthy looking and even have a bounce to it. I still need to trim the split ends but the hair lush is keeping it from looking dry or frizzle before I can make it to my hair appointment. It smells nice, gives a healthy shine, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or sticky. I didn&#x27;t notice any hair thickening but my hair is already thick so I wasn&#x27;t concerned about that. I just needed to look shiny and more healthy and this product definitely did that for my hair. As for hair growth, I think it&#x27;s helping, my bangs seems to be growing faster.</li>
    <li> The name Hair Lush is NOT an understatement. It only took a few days&#x27; use to notice a difference in the volume of my hair. It started looking and feeling thicker and more luscious right away. You have to use it every day but it only takes a very small amount to do the job each time so that bottle will last you for quite a while! It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or oily and doesn&#x27;t leave any build up or residue like other similar products. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a fuller and healthier head of hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  It smells amazing and my hair feels thicker and softer with each use.  The shampoo feels so luxurious.  I would use this product just for the way it makes my hair feel but it also really works.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this product, I have noticed a big change in my hair texture. My hair seems fuller and full of volume that I hadn&#x27;t experienced while using other products on the market. I am really excited to see even more results as I continue to use this product. I also love the smell of the product and have gotten many compliments on it. For anyone who is contemplating on using this product, don&#x27;t...try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The recipient likes this stuff, it was a gift.  Shipped nice and fast.</li>
    <li> Between this serum and my Ultrax caffeinated shampoo, my hair is experiencing a sort of renaissance. This is the worst winter ever for my locks and I thought I&#x27;d have to suck it up. I love the shampoo and its ability to add some shine to my hair, (as well as prevent my drain from clogging) but the serum goes above and beyond to make my hair look bouncy, thick and beautiful instead of dry and BLAH! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I am immensely happy with this product since it is easy to apply, works, and is a true find. I am already seeing results by having more hair follicles appearing and the value is good. Its simple to use and leaves no residue.</li>
    <li> Since using this product, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a change in strength in my hair. My hair is more full, vibrant and even lush! So glad I tried this out.</li>
    <li> After trying many products I finally found one that works. I noticed in several weeks a change in the length of my hair. I also noticed how full and thick my hair was becoming. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Have been using Ultrax Labs Hair Lush for a few months and have not noticed any real improvement. Smells nice, may make hair a bit fuller but not sure it&#x27;s slowing down or stopping hair loss. If it is  then it&#x27;s at a very minimal rate.</li>
    <li> For those with thinning or naturally thin hair, this is a must-buy! Not only does this serum make your hair look and feel thicker, it also adds a beautiful shine with no sticky build-up. A dime-sized amount is all you need and the more you use it, the more you&#x27;ll notice more volume and thickness!</li>
    <li> I love this product I would buy again it smells great and it does its job great product for a great price</li>
    <li> This just continues to get better and better each time. I have already tried one of their products and this one just adds the cherry on top to the already amazing product that there is. I love the sensation that it gives when its in my hair, and I can&#x27;t even begin to let you understand how great my hair looks after using it. This is definitely a product that I suggest anyone to try, and you will enjoy the difference in your hair every time you use it, but more than anything you will always continue to love the feeling of beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush | Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment Formula Serum helps with thicking hair. Helped with hair loss. Adds fullness and body to hair. Effective treatment to thining hair.</li>
    <li> I got mislead by all the good reviews. I bought this item hoping that it slow down my hair loss or improve my hair growth. Well, long story short... it didn&#x27;t work. So, be warned!!</li>
    <li> what is in this product?? my hair looks so wonderful and shiny after only 2 days of use (I bought the shampoo as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with hair loss since my early 20&#x27;s thanks to genetics, and only recently did I decide to start searching for a product to give me some help. I&#x27;ve used Ultrax Labs products before, but I&#x27;d have to say this is up there with their best. It was fast acting, giving me that fullness back that I&#x27;ve had all my life. After about 1.5 weeks, I started to see the fullness returning at my scalp - my biggest problem area. It slows hair loss considerably to the point where I barely have much falling out anymore these days. I can&#x27;t decide if there is also a conditioner in there, but I&#x27;m also finding my hair to be extremely soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed with the product line that Ultrax has available. This product truly does get your hair to it&#x27;s fullest potential. The discovery of caffeine thickening treatment formula serum is something! This adds thickness and increases the lasting benefits of a thicker and fuller head of hair. Using this will maximize hair growth and minimize hair loss. It&#x27;s safe for men and women to use. If your looking to grow thick healthier fuller hair look no further.</li>
    <li> I love this product . It help bring my hair back to life and help my hair strengthen and be more thicker. my hair has been in bad shape and this product has helped get my hair on the right track. Now i am seeing real results that last.</li>
    <li> I Love this hair product it makes my hair feel and look smoother and thicker. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
    <li> A total reinvigoration for your hair.  The consistency is perfect and it leaves you with a fresh feeling every time.&lt;br /&gt;You can actually notice a difference within days, it thickens the lousiest thin hair and you can have noticeable (to other people as well) richer and thicker hair within a a few short weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The product lasts longer since it has a very rich consistency, you don&#x27;t need to apply as much per use.</li>
    <li> Just tried this and it really works. My hair will look great in no time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this serum...it makes my hair feel amazing. There is no sticky or greasy feel to my hair like with other products. I&#x27;m noticing a real change in the thickness of my hair, makes styling much easier. This was a great buy.</li>
    <li> My mother bought this and all she can say is luscious.Great hair thickener that makes your hair look and feel thicker immediately. Definitely worth price.10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been going through my terrible thin hair genetics from my dad&#x27;s side and I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for something that works.&lt;br /&gt;Ultra lab hair formula to thicken hair has really done the job for me. I personally would recommend it to everyone! Seriously!  My thin hair makes me look bald from under the sun and I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and I see results my friends Can&#x27;t believe the full head of thick hair I&#x27;ve got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys and ladies go for it!  Its awesome!  It really works. Stop wasting your time and money with other products. This ultraX labs hair lush is a promise !</li>
    <li> This amazing leave-in hair formula has done wonders for my thin, brittle hair.  I have noticed a complete change in hair strength and thickness! I can now give my hair a little tug &amp; brush without it breaking off! I have never been happier with a product like this.  My hair is no longer brittle and feels thicker and stronger than ever!!!! I recommend it to anyone who deals with thin, brittle hair. You will love it!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product it helps thicken your hair while promoting hair growth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle now, and I am noticing new hair growth coming in.  My hair seems to be getting thicker.  I am really happy I found it and I plan to keep using it.  I highly recommend it!.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! Not only does it leave your hair smelling like you just left the salon, but it actually works! Hair is noticeably thicker after only a few uses. Don&#x27;t be surprised that it is quite small, a little of the product goes a long way. I keep it in my purse, as you can use it on wet or dry hair, I&#x27;ve used this after the gym, after the beach, really whenever I can. I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This line of product is amazing!  It makes my hair feel thicker and stronger than other products I have used, Including other leave in products.  Not to mention that with this line of products, my hair is healthier too!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed that this product did not live up to its claims.  It claims it will INSTANTLY make hair thicker and grow healthy hair.  My hair isn&#x27;t necessarily all that thin, nor do I have hair loss that is significant but the product description  ( followed by so many rave reviews) gave me reason to believe the product would at least enhance my hair to make it look fuller and more lush.  OK, so after just 4 uses, I didn&#x27;t expect there to be time to instantly see healthy hair growth, but I did expect it to make my hair instantly look fuller like it said it would.  Instead, it not only did not look fuller, it lost it&#x27;s shine and bounce and looked dull, dry and fly-away.  Happy for all the customers who had positive experiences, but unfortunately, I&#x27;m going to have to send mine back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for a little while, and I really like the clean, lemony smell and the way it makes my hair feel. I can feel the tingle in my scalp, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s wishful thinking that has me thinking that it&#x27;s already working. So finding this to go along with it is very exciting. I can&#x27;t wait to report back.</li>
    <li> Gives hair nice body. It doesn&#x27;t help with hair growth.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My husband started using this product recently and has seen instant results. This leave in serum makes his hair feel thicker and look fuller almost immediately. it also smells really good. He uses this along with the caffeine shampoo by Ultrax Labs and he is starting to grow hair again where it was receding around his temples. Five stars and recommended!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always nice when you can see and feel results fast. Though growing hair takes longer, you can feel and see a difference after using the product, and the best part is, there&#x27;s more to come later when the hair grows in. Look forward to using this for a long time to come!!</li>
    <li> My dad always told me you get what you pay for. This has never been truer than with the cheap hair thickening products I have purchased over the years. What a waste. I finally decided to pay for the premium Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine after it was clear the cheaper brands didn’t work. I couldn’t be happier. Its been two months and my hair looks full like when I just leave the barbershop after the barber spent forty minutes tending to every follicle on my head to make my hair look impeccable. The other good part is you don’t have too use much so the bottle lasts a good long time. I’m still barely half done with my first bottle.  The density of my hair has diminished over the years. The fullness I get from Ultra Labs serum literally makes it look like I have more hair. I gather this also makes my hair healthier. It certain is growing quicker. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment Formula Serum does everything the title says. It thickens hair almost instantly and help with hair growth by activating weakened hair follicles to promote growth. Created for both men and women works by focusing on each individual strand. The innovative caffiene technology within this formula not only helps with hair growth but keeps your hair healthy and full even after use. It takes a few weeks of use for full results, but you are sure to see improvement in the appearance of your hair in just a few days.</li>
    <li> Expensive product by since it had a lot of good reviews I bought it big mistake, my hair is falling way more than before.. I wish I could find something that really works and will stop my hair from falling off 😭😭</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Within a few times of using it, my hair seems to be thicker, and had way more volume than before! I also love the fast that is doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily after using it. I already have an oily scalp so I was pretty impressed it didn&#x27;t make it worse. Love the outcome of my hair after this product and I will continue to use and rave to my friends about it for a very long time!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I only give it 4 stars because it is so darn expensive!  But it works!</li>
    <li> Goes on easily (I was afraid that it would be sticky or make my hair stiff.) You don&#x27;t need to use very much - a little goes a long way!  My hair looked and felt thicker right away.  And as an added bonus - smells great!  .</li>
    <li> I purchased the ultrax labs hair surge caffeine shampoo, conditioner and hair lush... in short, I didn&#x27;t see any results.  I&#x27;m not sure how they have so many positive reviews but save your money.</li>
    <li> Size and make of the bottle changed for my recent order. Disapponted!</li>
    <li> My family has a long line of history of thinning hair and I wanted to keep a positive attitude when I first started to notice my hair loss...This is my second round using Ultrax Hair Lush and I must say I am overjoyed.  I noticed less hair loss in the shower, almost next to none with this caffeinated serum. it has definitely given me a healthier, thicker hair. My hair has not looked this good in years! I highly recommend this product. You will not be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair, it&#x27;s been that way since birth. From the moment I hit my teenage years all the way up until my adulthood I have tried every hair thickening product out there. So when I purchased Ultrax Thickening Treatment, I was skeptical. The serum is non-greasy and easy to apply. My hair felt stronger and looked healthier. I noticed more volume and my hair looked fuller! I was amazed! I also started using the Ultrax hair growth shampoo, a great combination! I recommend Ultrax products for anyone looking to bring their hair back to life.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with loosing my lovely hair for many years now.&lt;br /&gt;I have been to the doctor to see if there is a medical condition causing the issue, they found no answers.&lt;br /&gt;I am starting my second bottle of this Ultrax Hair Lush and have been very happy so far. My hair has stopped thinning and there is some re growth. I am hoping this progress continues.</li>
    <li> This leave in hair formula is amazing, It has done wonders to my thinning , brittle hair. I have used many products that claim to do the same thing. Hair growth, full head of hair stop the thinning blah, blah and no results. But when I heard about Hair Lush and I tried it I love the results I am getting from this formula.  I am definitely getting the look, the growth, the shine and bounce I was seeking  and I am looking forward to continue using this product. I would recommend this formula to anyone with thinning and brittle hair issues.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after purchasing the Ultrax Labs Caffeine Hair Loss shampoo and it is the perfect combo for increasing my hair volume. When I first got the serum bottle I thought it was pretty small but the amount you need is dismal so the bottle actually goes a long way. I am loving how my hair looks now and I hardly ever wear it up!</li>
    <li> This product does thicken your hair quickly and it is so easy to use since it is a serum! I love Ultrax Labs products!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It does wonders for thinning hair. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Awesome products.I bought this to help make my hair grow an become thick. The serum doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oil which was my one of my favorite thing about this product. With then 1 week my was became thicker my hair was so thin an still falling out do to recent surgery an different meds .I take on a daily basis. The ultra labs is the best thing out there for people with thin hair or bald spots. My friends an family were like who an what are you using I told them ultra labs they all were like wanting to buy it. I&#x27;m super happy with this product it leaves my hair looking shiner an healthy. love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few products to prevent hair loss which caused my face to break out since I wasn&#x27;t drinking enough water while taking Biotin however I am happy with the results I&#x27;m seeing so far. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> First off, I would like to say I am a huge fan of Ultra Labs products. Especially the caffeine hair loss serum!! It leaves my hair feeling THICK and SOFT. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like my usual hair products do which I don&#x27;t like whatsoever. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as he has been insecure about his thinning hair for quite sometime.  He has been using this for 2 months now and we both notice more fullness in his hair.  His coworker as well has asked him what he was using so he could give it a try as well!</li>
    <li> This works like a leave in conditioner.  It uses the properties of caffeine to give you a thicker full bodied hair while minimizing hair loss.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Great Product! I started seeing results after a few weeks of using. I started loosing hair a few years ago, due to some personal health issues....but this product has definitely helped and I can see major improvement.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product to use in conjunction with the shampoo, especially if you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday.  You just squirt a little in your hand and then rub it in.  This has all the vitamins that build up strong hair growth and is backed up by science!  I found this article in pubmed (I&#x27;m a bit of a research geek) and was shocked that this isn&#x27;t more well known!  Here is the link to the article that I found.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24836650&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth a try!!  And as always a good diet doesn&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
    <li> I used this product after using two other products that worked extremely well.  And this one did not disappoint.  Just like other reviews, this product worked as advertised.  It thickened my hair and seemed to promote growth in a very short time.  It also seemed to support and augment the effects of the other Ultrax Labs products I was using.  Excellent product.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Using this serum in addition to the Ultrax shampoo has really helped the appearance of my hair and scalp.  My hair is fuller and feels much healthier!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!! It gave me a much thicker, youthful appearance to my hair and also added shine! I would definitely recommend this to anyone and will be repurchasing when I am out!</li>
    <li> WOW EXCELLENT product works wonders</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t worth it. After using the whole bottle, any result. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I was so pleasantly surprised when I decided to try the Ultrax hair thickening serum! I have already been using the shampoo and with quick and amazing results, I thought why settle here? Do I want amazing hair or not? Would this serum actually add that much to the shampoo? So…I tried it and SO Happy I did. I noticed an immediate improvement, in addition to using the shampoo. Yes, worth it if you’re wanting beautiful hair now! I have so many hair products my drawer is overflowing, time to throw it away.  I have used the serum with my hair damp it works very well, but for my curly, normally frizzy hair, it works amazing on dry hair. Once my hair dries I can see all the extra frizzy looking stuff, where it is broken off, I use just a small amount of the serum and my hair is smooth, shiny and luscious. The best part about it is that it immediately absorbs into your hair and leaves no residue, like the very expensive hair serums I’ve tried. Take a chance, try it and don’t settle for mediocrity.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after I had been using the Ultra Labs Shampoo because I have come to know that products made by the same company have synergy.  I was not disappointed.  The serum is not greasy and now, along with the shampoo I see much more definitive thickness.  I&#x27;m going to add the conditioner so I will get the full product synergy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in addition to the caffine shampoo and they both have done wonders to my hair. I was  amazed at how much hair grew back and even got thicker! I will continue to use this product and I recommend you try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hair Lush for about 3 months and I&#x27;ve seen some unbelievable improvements in the thickness of my hair.  Actually, the strength, texture and overall health of my hair has improved tenfold!  After the first month I noticed that the thinnest parts of my hair (in the front center)  got way more dense and by now my scalp is almost completely covered with my thickening strands.  I use this product along with the Ultrax Labs Caffeine Hair Stimulating Shampoo and the results are fabulous.  I notice both regrowth and thickening.  Besides all of that, my hair feels softer and silkier.  I would definitely recommend this product because it works!</li>
    <li> Thinning hair runs in my family so my edges are bare. This product helped bring life back to my edges and given me more confidence!</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my hair. Embarrassingly enough it&#x27;s been thinning out even though I&#x27;m only in my mid twenties. luckily though I was able to find this product, and believe me, it works. Not only that but it&#x27;s way more affordable then a lot of other options I looked at and easy to hide if you&#x27;re embarrassed. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery! Easy to use, great product. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd product in the Ultrax line that I have tried so far and I feel and see some great results from what I&#x27;m using so far! The quality of the products is amazing and the way these products make my hair smell is great.  When I leave the house I leave with more confidence and a general sense that I am doing something good for the health of my hair.  After reading the ingredients that they use and the results that others are getting I just had to try it. I really enjoy the texture of the product as well. I look forward to trying more products from this brand and I will keep you posted on my results!</li>
    <li> I went through the whole bottle in no time. The bottle only lasted all of 3 weeks.  Ever since I got hair lush, I haven&#x27;t been seeing as much hair loss. As to increasing hair thickness and volume, I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable difference. I am moving on to the next product.</li>
    <li> Great value product! You only need a tiny amount, so the bottle lasts a long time. After about a month your hair will be healthier, shinier, and and thicker. I&#x27;ve tried other caffeine hair growth products and this one is the best bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how but this product truly works! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and I can already start to see changes. I&#x27;ve been losing hair in the middle of my scalp for some time now but after using this, I&#x27;m starting to get my confidence back. I recommend this product to anyone looking to stop hair loss.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has made such a difference!</li>
    <li> Well, as a man ...when you begin to lose your hair is a shock for you, so I began to combine some vitamins and shampoos to have a strong hair and this products really works... really works....you intermediately realize that your hair is becoming thicker and thicker with the pass of the days.  And is strong too....this really works and I recommend it to everybody that it&#x27;s losing hair. 99.9999% effective.  I see results because I am straight with my treatments.</li>
    <li> After the first appliance, you can immediately see the difference in the thickness of your hair. Your hair feels/looks healthier, fuller, and shinier. I could not be happier with the results. This product will leave your once-brittle hair feeling stronger and thicker than ever. I would highly recommend this all my family members and friends with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> this is the first review I have ever posted on Amazon because this product is so good I felt that I had to write a review.  I have had some significant hair loss in the recent months and it was noticeable when I would style my hair in the morning and I was becoming very self-conscious about it.  Along with anti-hair loss shampoo I put this stuff in when my hair is wet right after the shower and then blow dry and style and my hair looks so much thicker it&#x27;s amazing.  Not only thicker but shinier and healthier.  I will certainly be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product - I&#x27;m not surprised. At how highly it has been reviewed here.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years and it has completely changed the quality of my hair, which is evident in photos.  If you&#x27;re considering getting one product to prevent or reverse the effects of hair loss, this one is ideal.</li>
    <li> This product is a gimmick. I&#x27;ve used almost the entire bottle and I don&#x27;t see a slightly difference. It does not make your hair grow or even stops hair loss as they advertise. Don&#x27;t buy it - you will waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have recent tried the Ultrax products and have say they are a great find!&lt;br /&gt;In the past few years my hair has become lifeless and started to fall out more and more as I brushed it. i was desperate to save my lovely hair ans I purchased the hair lush upon a friend&#x27;s recommendation. After using it, I noticed a big difference! It seems to have  stopped the thinning and I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I did not like the delivery method.  The product is thick and it pumps out in a glob.  And eye dropper deliver method would allow you to be more targeted in the application.  No issues with delivery of the product however.</li>
    <li> Ive used this item for a month now and love it. A true must have. My hair looks so nice and thick. I get complements all the time on how shiny it is too.</li>
    <li> Congrats, you found it!! This is the solution to your hair thinning/loss problem!  Not only does Hair Lush work, it works quickly.  Within just a few days of beginning to use it, my hair was thicker and healthier, and was definitely stronger--no more snapping off in the brush in the morning, no more shedding.  After a week or two, my hair began to regrow in areas that haven&#x27;t had any in years!  Now my hair has a natural, supple bounce to it.  Plus, Hair Lush isn&#x27;t oily or slimy like some other products I have tried, and doesn&#x27;t leave that weird sticky build-up on your hair.  I definitely recommend this to all of you who aren&#x27;t happy with your thinning hair!!</li>
    <li> I have the shampoo with caffeine and I decided to try this product as well because the shampoo has made my hair thicken back up and shiny.  These two together have to work even better.  nice texture to it and great product all the way around.  I suggest this if you have thinning hair or hair loss because it works very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all of the hair products by Ultrax Labs and I must say they never fail to impress.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they keep making these awesome products.</li>
    <li> Great addition to my shampoo by this company.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush is a great serum product for hair thickening!  It appears to enhance and accelerate new hair growth!  It strengthens brittle hair and leaves hair strong and lush- hence, it lives up to it&#x27;s name.  A little bit of LUSH serum goes along ways and results are noticed within a few days.  It does NOT leave hair greasy when used with in small portions applied directly to scalp.  It is highly effective when used with Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo and Ultrax labs Solace Caffeine Hair Loss Groth Simulating Conditioner.  However, results CAN still be found by use of the product alone!  If you too are looking for hair thickening results, Ultras Labs Hair LUSH is worth trying!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff. It leaves your roots feeling and smelling clean while it improves the thickness of your hair. I have tried Rogaine and it makes your hair sticky and dirty.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this Thickening Serum in conjunction with another previously purchased product by the same company (Ultrax Labs Surge Caffeine Hair Growth Shampoo) for an extra boost. This product works surprisingly well after shampooing my hair with the Growth Shampoo. I applied this product to semi-damp hair and it resulted in my dull, thin, and  brittle hair being revived and looking very voluminous. I am amazed that this is not just another hair growth &amp;#34;gimmick&amp;#34; product that doesn&#x27;t live up to its advertisement. Although, it usually takes several weeks (or even months) for my hair to show signs of growth in the thinning areas, I can honestly say that this Thickening Serum has provided faster results, than any similar product.</li>
    <li> I have been plaqued with hair thinning issues since I was young, a genetic curse from my mother&#x27;s side. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there and have spent hundreds of dollars trying to get thickness and volume back into my hair. I was just about to give up when I came across Hair Lush. In just a few days after my first application, I have decided this is the only product I will use for my hair thinning problem! I have seen a remarkable difference in the overall volume and thickness of my hair in such a short time; I can&#x27;t wait to see my long term results! One of the things I love most about Hair Lush is that the consistency is light and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. I have found the most amazing product for my hair at a reasonable price compared to other products that haven&#x27;t even come close in results. Hair Lush has given me my hair back! :)</li>
    <li> Awesome! Builds up the fullness of hair without causing any irritation or stickiness. Doesn&#x27;t feel like a big mess weighing your head down. Actually noticeable how thicker and stronger each individual hair is. And most importantly- it works. What more could you ask in a hair product than something that actually does what it says it does? Easy to use and effective, definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> it did nothing for me</li>
    <li> It has a nice gel consistency which I think works a LOT better than other formulas such as creams, oils, etc. I think because the hair follicles can actually absorb it faster than cream which sits more on the surface, along with oil which cant even mix with water and have bigger molecules... Whenever you want to try a treatment for the hair, always go with gel formula or a gel-type light formula if you want good results!&lt;br /&gt;It definitely boosts and speeds up the production of new hair growth and I think the result would be better with a shampoo that I use which is called, &amp;#34;Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo&amp;#34; which I saw a definite change in after using it also. This combination keeps the hair from falling out and thickens the hair(with this serum) so you have full body, although this body is supposed to give you body and fullness as well. It&#x27;s better to prevent falling out also! :)&lt;br /&gt;Caffine is a great ingredient to boost hair, skin, etc., so I really like that this product is formulated with caffeine. I am not sure about the claim of faster hair growth since that takes a long period of time to see the difference (plus everyone&#x27;s hair grows at a different rate) this definitely did thicken and give volume to the hair, especially with hair loss because I lose so much hair after every shower... it&#x27;s insane. Anyway, definitely recommend you give it a shot!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have noticed thicker hair after just a few uses.  I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s absolutely amazing! Shiny and heathy looking hair and most important they are thicker! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This serum is definitely worth investing in. After using the Ultrax shampoo, I apply a small amount of the serum and try to massage it through as much of my scalp as possible. The bottle seems small, but I did this for a week and have found amazing results. The thickness in each strand, the quality of my hair, and the overall volume have visibly improved. I have tried a variety of volumizing shampoos from multiple brands, but the combination of these two products have produced the best results thus far. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone that is suffering hair loss and thinning!</li>
    <li> Great product. My husband uses this regularly. Does all it says it does.</li>
    <li> This product worked amazingly, I suffer from early balding no more. My hair is thicker, stronger, fuller then it has been in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Ultrax Labs</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely fantastic product that can be used with wet or dry hair! It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or stiff like some of the other products and it has a nice scent. I definitely noticed thicker, healthier hair after using this for only 2 weeks! My hair was thicker and had a natural shine as well. I recommend using this product with the two others in this line for an awesome hair thickening, growing and enriching trifecta!</li>
    <li> I literally just got this product and already my hair is MUCH thicker and healthier all while looking completely natural.  Not only does my hair look so much healthier, but there is also a bounce to it. I absolutely LOVE this hair product I would recommend it to anyone and it worked so fast! One important thing about Ultrax Labs Hair Lush is that it does not make my hair sticky and stiff like how other products on the market often do. This is a real winner and it also is very long lasting!</li>
    <li> I got an amazing discount this product truly does work! I will purchase more.</li>
    <li> I witnessed this stuff truly works, it is worth the money. Friend of mine needed this stuff for his hair loss, within weeks we both saw the results of this product, we were shocked to see how strong and quick the formula worked. If you are suffering from hair loss or thin hair, BUY THIS NOW</li>
    <li> I love this product line. You get exactly what you pay for! It also came in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> For years now I have been unhappy with the volume and thickness of my hair. I&#x27;ve tried shampoos, hair foams, any products that I could find that promised to thicken my hair and nothing seemed to work. One of my girl friends suggested Ultrax Laboratories to me, that her and all of her sisters use it; and her hair was very full! Definitely not thin like mine. I got the Ultrax Labs shampoo and the Hair Lush serum to try. After using them both every day for a week there was a clear difference in the thickness of my hair! My hair was fuller, bouncier, easier to style, it just looked amazing! The serum doesn&#x27;t smell repulsive like other products I&#x27;ve tried, it doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t leave grease in my hair after it actually leaves it nice and silky! Not only is my hair thicker but its actually stronger and doesn&#x27;t break or fall out as much anymore! People love my hair now more than ever and they definitely noticed the difference! Ultrax Laboratories is now number one in my book and I plan on using their products much more after this! I definitely recommend anybody with thin hair to try out this serum for yourself! Just like it says on the bottle, &amp;#34;results you expect from the brand you trust&#x27;, Ultrax has definitely earned my trust!</li>
    <li> This is a hair growth product worth investing in. I saw results within a week of using it! It&#x27;s super easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or oily afterwards. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and my hair is looking better than it ever has. It&#x27;s thicker and feels healthier than I ever remember it being!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when first purchased the product. Although it comes in a small bottle, it&#x27;s concentrated so that you only need a small amount. Within a few days of using daily I felt my hair had a natural healthy shine and after a few weeks, my hair was thicker and fuller. I even noticed some growth where there was very little growth before, and my hair had more body. I am very impressed with this hair lush product and will be buying again soon.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of hair care products!!! This is the third product I have gotten from ultrax. So far I have the shampoo, vitamins and now this. I can&#x27;t believe how much my hair has transformed. Before I used these products my hair was falling out in handfuls. Now it is totally different. My hair fills so much thicker and has way more volume. I would totally recommend this brand to anyone who is feeling insecure about their hair. A great product.</li>
    <li> I brought this because of all the good reviews I saw, and kept using it for a few months, can&#x27;t really see any effect so I just stopped using it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve been struggling with thinning hair for sometime now. When I say this product and the excellent reviews, I had to try it. So far, I have noticed an incredible difference. I no longer find a large amount of hair falling out in the shower and down the drain. My hair feels noticeably thicker and softer! No harsh smells or burning. Wonderful product for anyone needing that extra boost of hair growth!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother who has thin hair , along with the shampoo . She started using it but not as often as it says (5 times a week) and she has noticed a big difference with her hair. It is easy to use and smells as good as the shampoo. You have converted my mom and I into permanent fans. Thanks</li>
    <li> When used alone or with Ultrax&#x27;s Shampoo; This is a winning combination.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great since it&#x27;s a unisex product. A little serum goes along way.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used on wet, damp or dry hair. No extra build up, or dandruff on hair or scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair with fuller volume, smoother and less hair frizz or fly-aways.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price and would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is a really awesome product and worth every star! It does exactly what it says. I use it as instructed and my hair literally feels thicker and softer and there is a noticeable difference. I can see that my hair is actually starting to grow in. I will definitely reorder this product and highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Like what it does to my hair. However, to early to see any hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily for about 6 weeks now along with their shampoo (5 days a week as directed). I used the product as directed and this product has had not effect at all. The 5 star reviews seem suspicious as others have pointed out.</li>
    <li> So far so good, been using for about 3 weeks now and notice softer fuller hair.  Will probably use this forever now.</li>
    <li> I have long thin blond hair. I used this serum for two months, every day after I wash my hair. Within 2 first weeks of use I felt my hair became fuller and ponytail seemed to be ticker. But at some point I just stopped to see any effect. Possibly, because my hair just got used to it. Also I can&#x27;t tell if that thickness was permanent, the difference seemed to be very dramatic when I just started, but now I can&#x27;t tell if my hair got thinner back or remains the same. At some point I even thought all this positive reviews make me believe in this product and I got very strong placebo effect.</li>
    <li> perfect hair thickening shampoo! I love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect for thinning hair. This actually works. I feel a definite difference. When I run my hands through my hair it feels thicker and stronger. Ultralax knows what&#x27;s it&#x27;s doing with hair products. Not only does it make hair stronger but you actually know new hairs are growing. I cannot suggest the full line of ultra lax products enough. I&#x27;m so satisfied with how my hair looks and feels. It&#x27;s thick and healthy, and I&#x27;m no longer worried about going bald.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and immediately started using it on my thin hair,  it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks and I swear my hair is longer and has so much body that I could be in a hair product commercial now. This Item shipped super fast and was exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;m super excited to see what my hair has in store for me in the future.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve grown up with baby fine hair. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there and have spent hundreds trying to get some thickness and body back into my locks. Hair Lush has worked wonders on my hair. I have seen an amazing and drastic change in my hair. It feels and looks thicker. My hair is also easier to style. I am thrilled with the positive change in volume that my hair has. I also am very pleased with the consistency of Hair Lush. My hair continues to feel thicker and full of life. Hair lush has become a routine part of my day. Using this product has helped me feel more confident to try new styles with my hair. I get asked what my secret is by friends and family daily. When I tell them my secret, they are astonished. I love this product and am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I love how shiny this makes my Hair!</li>
    <li> Using this Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Thickening Treatment Formula Serum puts the “treat” in treatment when it comes to applying this gel like substance to your hair. Using this extremely easy and convenient product while improving the thickness and overall health of your hair is what makes this a real treat. I love the feeling of having thicker hair again and being able to feel the difference after using this product, when I run my hands through my hair. With this product, you can take it wherever you go and apply it either wet or dry, it&#x27;s that simple! When you can thicken your hair and improve its overall fullness, it makes it hard to refuse this travel sized serum. Using Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Thickening Serum as recommended improves overall health, thickness of thin hair, hair loss, and gives you the confidence you once had before. l would recommend this thickening treatment to anyone having similar problems with thin hair or hair loss!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs makes amazing products. This leave in treatment has been especially effective and has caused my hair to show real improvement. My hair is thicker, my hair is healthier, and my hair is more plentiful! I recommend this product to anyone who isn&#x27;t satisfied with their hair.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any change yet</li>
    <li> This hair serum is amazing on my thinning hair. After a couple of uses I realize my hair is thicker all around my head as I have more hair when I tie it in a ponytail. It dries really well into my scalp and doesn&#x27;t become sticky or gooey after applying. It also doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and oily, weighing down my hair. I love how I don&#x27;t smell any strong odor coming from this serum. With continued uses, my hair became healthier and softer. The texture of the hair starts to change as well. I would recommend this product to people with thinning hair problems like me.</li>
    <li> This product is absolute greatness. My hair is so much fuller and thicker. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> A product this good is worth a review. Thanks to the providers of this hair loss and thickening solution. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My significant other bought this for me to try, I have suffered from male pattern baldness for some time now and have tried other products in the past, but Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Serum works just like it is advertised. It stimulates your hair follicles to make your hair shafts fuller and thicker, something that someone with hair loss issues can truly appreciate. I am using this with another Ultrax product (their shampoo), so I was hoping they would work well together.  What I did not expect to see was how effective this product was at growing fuller, thicker hair.  It&#x27;s amazing how many products are out there that make similar claims, but don&#x27;t measure up.  My hair now feels healthy and has a great shine, but the real story about this product is how it affects how I feel about my own self image.  Having new hair growth has me loving this product and I will be buying it again, thanks Honey!  and thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> As a guy I can get a little self conscious about hair especially since it is thinning. Honestly, I&#x27;ve always worn hats to try and cover up how thin my hair is. It is just really flat, breaks easily and sometimes it looks like I am actually balding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I started using this serum and I have been quite happy with everything in terms of the results! So, to begin with, it works the very first time you use it to provide a thicker appearance and seems quite healthy and robust. Basically, I get instant body added to my hair without needing to use chemicals that seem damaging and super toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, in terms of the product and what it does, This product has Ultrax has increased the thickness of my hair over time and even has helped in terms of less breakage! The complete package in terms of success and results. You can&#x27;t beat this product because it is convenient and does not leave looking oily but instead quite healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> Dealing with thinning hair? Give this a try!!! It is a great product for the price point and very effective. Recommend this highly!</li>
    <li> I have noticed a visible improvement in the thickness of my hair.  It is light and does not feel gunky in my hair.  Although the bottle is small, it goes a long way.  I have mid-long hair and use 3 pumps per day.  I love Ultrax Lab products!</li>
    <li> GREAT product. A dime-sized amount goes a very long way and brings thin hair back to life! Well worth the higher price.</li>
    <li> First ingredient alcohol... seriously? How is that good? I only using it for a week so no results yet and don&#x27;t expect to see anything besides dry scalp from alcohol. This bottle is tiny and price is outrageous for questionable product... I wonder if these wonderful reviews are even real.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair, used it for a week and never noticed a difference. By the end of the day my hair felt brittle and very dirty. Very expensive.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product! In just a few weeks my hair has gotten thicker, and way stronger. Plus its not all sticky and greasy like other products I&#x27;ve tried, it leaves your hair feeling lightweight and bouncy!! Hair lush is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> if it sounds too good to be true than it probably is and the Hair Lush is no exception. I have not experienced ANY of the claims that others (interestingly mostly women) have reported despite a month of using the shampoo, conditioner, and lush.  Caffeine can grow hair?!? One measly star since the lush might make my scalp less oily. No increased or thicker hair growth whatsoever. Don&#x27;t waste the time or money. And by all means be skeptical of all these fake glowing reviews! I decided to give it a go and my wallet is that much lighter as a result.</li>
    <li> As it contains 48% alcohol, it will dry your hair like crazy! In addition it is insanely overpriced, as the product will only last approximately 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Hair Thickening Treatment Serum is a great serum to provide thickness and give your hair fullness. The serum is non-greasy and non sticky, with a nice smell. Ultrax Labs also has Hair Surge Shampoo which also provides thickness, as well as strength, and scalp vitality to the hair. I would recommend the Ultrax Labs line to anyone looking to get thicker, fuller and stronger hair.</li>
    <li> Yes, this product is a bit pricey, but it is worth every penny! I have been reading how caffeine may help thinning hair and I decided to give it a try.  What do I really have to lose, right?  I came across this product and although small, it is very concentrated.  Make sure to get it well onto your scalp and massage it in.  I use this product once a day.  Not only does my hair look and feel fuller, it has a shinier luster to it.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair will look when I use it for even longer.</li>
    <li> My hair is looking so beautiful, longer and thick and it hasn&#x27;t left my hair dry or oily. You notice results so quickly, it&#x27;s amazing!! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> gel works but the pump doesn&#x27;t work well.  Frustrating the get the pump to pump.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use especially after using the Ultrax shampoo. It&#x27;s a leave in product so it really adds extra protection and sheen as well as thickening your hair. Killer combination!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a friend who got a sample and she swore by it, so I decided to purchase it for my special fella. He was starting to comment about his hair thinning and I could tell it bothered him. So I tricked him into using it by telling him I got it for myself and he loves it. It&#x27;s amazing how effective it is. I love the shine it adds to my hair personally, but the real success of this product is seeing what it has done to make my guy feel better about himself. A little does indeed go a long way, especially for men. I have created a repeat customer, lol. The price is well justified for how long it lasts and also because other haircare lines charge hundreds of dollars for &amp;#34;systems&amp;#34; that require months and months to see results.</li>
    <li> My Hair feels great! I love this brand!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush is luscious for the hair. I love their products and what they have done for my hair. They have noticeably made my hair softer and thicker. My hair is breaking less as well. I also noticed I am losing less hair each time. This product makes managing my hair easier. The serum helps with texture of my hair and gives it more definition, volume and feel thicker. This product is definitely worth it and the caffeine definitely stimulates hair growth. This serum also makes my hair smell really nice.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Be very liberal when applying it. No need to worry about it being to thick or forming into a glob like pomade. The viscosity is just right.  it  It gives a lot of volume to hair throughout the day but it isn&#x27;t as intrusive as hairspray. It has a pleasant scent to it and keeps hair manageable and lush all day. Once applied to the hair, there is a nice cooling sensation..</li>
    <li> Ease your mind! Your hair will soon return! This is the third product of Ultrax Labs that i&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m seeing great results. Easy to use! product. I pump a tiny amount into my hand and then massage on my scalp lightly. No oily or greasy hair. After you put it in you can style your hair as normal. It also has a very nice light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had very very fine and thin hair. This product really does increase the thickness of each strand of hair and works to increase hair growth, and a very noticeable difference. I will be using these product for a long time coming!</li>
    <li> Out of all the hair loss serums I&#x27;ve tried in my time, Ultarx Labs is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works faster than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and the price is far more reasonable. Within a few uses, I started to notice thicker fuller hair. Like magic! I can finally stop throwing money away on all the other inferior products I&#x27;ve been relying on. The formula is is light and fragrant, not gooey like some other products and blends well in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my hair is looking and feeling. Stop your search for the best hair loss serum! You&#x27;ve found it! Great for men and women!</li>
    <li> very expensive for something that did not seem to work.  If it was half the price I might try a second bottle and give it another chance.  But after one full bottle, I saw no visible difference in the appearance of my hair, and certainly no new growth in the thinning areas.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product! Applying for two weeks already, using every day and so far so good. I am noticing how fast my hair is growing and those thin spots are getting fluffy :).Thanks!!</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;d like to thank Ultrax Labs for making this product, as well as their shampoo and conditioner for hair loss. It has drastically improved the condition of my hair.  As someone who has struggled with embarrassingly thin, brittle strands and wasted SO much money on products that only left me feeling disappointed, I am proud to say I&#x27;ve finally found this caffeine-based serum to do wonders for my hair. There is a noticeable difference in thickness and appears to be fuller and healthier looking. It has really put life back into my hair! The non-greasy serum is easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue behind (like some others I&#x27;ve tried in the past) or feel sticky or heavy. I think Hair Lush is worth every penny and more for saving my hair and I&#x27;d definitely recommend to anyone looking for an anti-hair loss solution!</li>
    <li> Ultra lab hair lush has given me a second chance at a full set of hair. I always tough that hair grouth items where a scam or way to expensive but ultra lab has changed my opinion about  both.</li>
    <li> This actually works. My hair was there it just wold not grow. I started using Hair Lush and wow it worked. Even my hair dresser noticed the difference!!!!</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my hair, it was thin and breaking and I had tried so many things.  After using this I have seen a great difference in how thick my hair is it now covers my scalp on top to. My hair also does not fall out while using this product.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants fuller, thicker, healthier, shiner hair.</li>
    <li> OMG  -  my  hair is thick and shiny and healthy again .It looks  better  than the  salon version of my hair . It stays the same way 2 days after I use  this  serum. I can style  m own hair at home  and save  time &amp; money . When  I went back to the salon for my hair color my stylist was  so impressed with  the results  he&#x27;s now using this on his clients .</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I apply this product after I towel dry my hair making sure to massage it into my scalp while rubbing the excess directly to the ends of my hair. My once brittle, damaged hair is now lush and shiny with visibly less breakage.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is hopefully going to save my hair! I purchased this shampoo and was very excited to try it. I&#x27;ve always had thin hair but when I got older I noticed my hair falling out a lot more than usual. The bottle came well sealed and had a fruity smell to it. After using Ultrax Labs Hair Lush for over a week I noticed less hair falling out when I brush and less hair on the floor when I sweep my bedroom floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s hair is thinning. it does really help!</li>
    <li> I already tried 2 different products the fast 6 months and Hair Lush by Ulrax Serum worked the best, hands down! The formula is concentrated, so you dont have to use much. The fact that the serum is not sticky or thick is a plus! My split ends seem to be mending back together because of the ingredients and enhanced conditioning effect. I Love that it gives you an added boost of energy because of the caffeine which can counteract hair loss/damage that you may have incurred over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this products for almost a week but saw results after the third day of consistent use. I&#x27;m excited to see what happens in a month! Im soo happy that the brittleness in my hair has been strengthening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, its definitely worth the try for results that come this fast. I highly recommend Ultrax Hair Lush Serum for thicker hair.</li>
    <li> 1st..I knew their Ultrax Labs caffeine hair-loss shampoo was a sure hit with me, but I was still using &#x27;the old stand-by&#x27; leave-in conditioner for volume and fullness that would not leave a heavy feel. Looking around and finding the Hair Lush, turns out it works perfectly in sync with the shampoo, providing the same caffeine stimulation AND (i was floored!) creating the thickness I was looking for. On top of all.....I cant help but notice how incredibly LIGHT this feels as a leave-in. Doesnt feel &#x27;strippy&#x27; or dull, just bouncy &amp; healthy!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! This fantastic product worth every penny, it very well works as described. I was amazed to see the result and how thick my hair was. My hair became so strong and is no more falling. I was surprised to see my hair growing so soon!</li>
    <li> This product works great, I have also used their supplements and a shampoo. It takes time but the results are great. My hair had always been embarrassingly thin before I started using Ultrax products. After a few months my hair was considerably thicker. I also got my friend to try and has worked for him. If you have thin hair, you must give it a try. I also noticed you don&#x27;t need a lot of the product with each use. Just a couple of squirts is enough. Good Luck</li>
    <li> My hair is both fine and thin, so I am always looking for products that will make it look thicker.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products I&#x27;ve lost count. Hair Lush is a small bottle and quite expensive at that.  I mistakenly thought since it cost so much it must be good.  Quite frankly I couldn&#x27;t see ANY  difference in the volume of my hair after using it.  I tried it twice, then sad to say, threw it out.  The best product I have found thus far is &amp;#34;got 2b spiked up hair gel&amp;#34;.  Hair Lush in my opinion is like putting water on your hair.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable how quickly this product has helped rebuild and reshape my head of hair. I have tried countless re-growth hair treatments but none that with such a quick turn around as this. I&#x27;ve struggled since I was a teen with thinning, fine hair. After 2-3 months of consistent usage, I was getting the good kind of looks and lots of compliments. Already have recruited a few of my friends to try it out. I am a big believer!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you probably enjoy having your hair and want to continue to do so for as long as possible. So, when I noticed a bit of the ole &amp;#34;thinning out&amp;#34; up front, needless to say, I was a bit alarmed. I&#x27;ve been skeptical of products like this one that promise to do so much and usually end up leaving me feeling kind of &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34;, to say the least. However, when I first rubbed this into my hair I instantly noticed a difference, and so did my friends actually. That was really what sealed it for me, having other people notice that my hair was looking especially &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;lush&amp;#34; really went a long way to making me feel good about my hair&#x27;s appearance. If you want thicker, fuller hair then this is definitely the one for you. I&#x27;ve actually had to start seeing the barber more regularly since I started using this Hair Lush product.</li>
    <li> It works! Got lots of baby hair!</li>
    <li> It makes my scalp feel tingly but that&#x27;s it. No hair growth, no reduction in hair loss.</li>
    <li> My Daughter Had Thin Spots In Her Hair. I Use The Shampoo With The Serum ! It Has Worked Like Magic On Me And My Daughter ! It Thickens Your Hair While Making It Healthier ! My Hair Has Bounce And My Daughters Hair Is More Manageable !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost the entire line of Ultrax Labs Hair Loss Prevention/regrowth products and there&#x27;s a legitimate reason for why they aren&#x27;t cheap; they actually work! This Hair Lush is like magic from the very first use. Genuine and unadulterated instant gratification (a very rare joy in this world). After one use I could not only see the difference in my hair, which looked luscious and thick, but I could feel it too. I&#x27;ll be honest, styling my hair was becoming a depressing reminder of the cruelty of time, but styling after using hair lush is freaking awesome. My hair looks and behaves like it used to, and I plan on keeping it this way. I will continue the use of this product and other Ultrax Labs products with confidence that my money was very very very well spent and my hair has sincerely never looked and felt better.</li>
    <li> I have a friend that has been struggling with hair loss and thinning hair due to Alopecia. I bought this product for her and her hair is now thicker than it has been in years, she loves it!</li>
    <li> This serum works really well. My hair is super thin so it falls out easily. This product managed to make my hair thicker and it stopped My hair from falling.</li>
    <li> This serum does wonders. All you need is a small amount. My hair is thicker and I&#x27;ve noticed less hair loss. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Having thin hair sucks, especially if it&#x27;s windy outside. I bought this product to just try initially. I didn&#x27;t expect much of it. However, my hair has become seemingly thicker over a course of 2 months. When I see my hair under certain lighting, my scalp is no longer as visible. My hair also feels thicker and heavier! Looking forward to see the results of this product in the upcoming months.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Hair Lush after using their Hair Surge shampoo and seeing a big difference.  I really like the product and it seemed to be working, It does not make your hair oily or sticky like some other products. Easy to use pump, and all you need a is very small amount and apply to your hair. This product really does increase the thickness of each strand of hair and works to increase hair growth, and a very noticeable change and I will be using this product for a long time coming!</li>
    <li> This serum works great with Ultrax shampoo and vitamins.  The shampoo and vitamins do take some time to see results, but this serum lets you see instant results!  My fine, thin hair is now thicker, there is more of it overall and breaks and falls out a whole lot less.  The trick for the serum is to put small amounts on your fingertips and then massage into your scalp and roots.  Style as usual.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or feel greasy. My friends and family have noticed a huge difference!!</li>
    <li> This serum worked for a friend of mine, who uses it together with the caffeine shampoo and supplements. It really worked for him so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum feels great. Nice and tingly upon application, and light enough that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy. I noticed a real difference within the first month of using it. I apply it to my hairline, which gives the hair framing my face a thicker, shiny texture. I&#x27;m really happy with it!</li>
    <li> I think this product is great t use, its just something that is really needed for great luxioursous hair sand its a great to have around you when you need that great hair experience. I love the product, and will use it often. Its great to have in your usage, and I give it a 5 start rating.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all.  Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I use it every Morning and it works just like it&#x27;s supposed to, its pretty darn noticeable, if your hair is thinning out this is a Must Try - Five Stars from me !</li>
    <li> This is not the products fault, but I had an allergic reaction to it.  Now I have a bottle that I only used twice and paid $50 for.  I am still using the shampoo and conditioner and love them.  Maybe I will try and resell it on ebay.</li>
    <li> I love the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo product and can&#x27;t wait to try this as a compliment to it.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Ultrax brand!</li>
    <li> This stuff is concentrated and works great. I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage and less hair on my pillow in the morning.  I&#x27;ve even received compliments on how much fuller my hair looks!</li>
    <li> I like that it goes straight to the roots.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to give a real true test.</li>
    <li> My hair started to thin a few years ago. I tryed every hair product on the market but nothing worked. I came across the ultrax labs hair lush product and hoped it would work and it did. I love it and saw results in just a few days. I highly recommend getting this product .</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I can really feel it strengthening my hair - and though I don&#x27;t see any new growth - I do notice an overall increase in the health of the strands I do have. This seems to be a common thing with the Ultrax products for me though, so it might just be me.&lt;br /&gt;Although this product is pretty small, it lasts forever. I&#x27;ve been using mine for around 2 or three weeks, and I barely see a dent in the thing. I&#x27;m sure that I can get the rest of the year out of it, which is awesome. I honestly have no idea how everyone seems to be running out so quickly; maybe they&#x27;re using too much product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> Great product after a few days of use i have notice my hair to begin looking fuller and thicker. It  messages into the scalp and hair very easily without leaving your hair feeling gooey or messy.  you will never see or feel any resiude from Hair lush. all around great product</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work to my expectation even though I checked the reviews on the product!</li>
    <li> I am 22 year old female. Out of no where i started experiencing severe hair loss (most likely stress related) and i turn to Ultrax after reading ALL the positive reviews. Well let me tell you that it DOES NOT WORK. In fact ever since Ive started using this product I&#x27;ve noticed that my scalp is itchy and I have been developing bumps (pimple like) on and around my scalp. Whether its an allergic reaction or not. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and already noticing a difference! My hair feels and looks fuller. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results down the road. After seeing results with their shampoo, I decided to add this to my hair routine and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I had fine, long hair, and this product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair smelling bad or sticky. Blends in well. I would recommend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> I started losing hair a couple of years ago so I decided to try this serum.  Within a couple of weeks, my hair was fuller and thicker.  After a month or so, I could see new hair sprouting.  I will continue to use and recommend this, it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
    <li> This product works!!This serum shows almost immediate results. After just a couple uses hair is shinier, fuller, and even has more bounce to it.  Another great aspect of this product is that it can be used at any time of the day which is wonderful for people with hectic schedules. The size of the bottle also works great, because you can take it with you anywhere. Compared to other products, this one leaves hair looking less oily after it has been applied. This serum is made up of ingredients that stimulate hair growth so fuller, longer hair will be noticeable!  This product appears to thicken individual strands of hair as well as boost hair growth in spots where is hair is thinning out. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Love this! Have recommended this to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to the caffeine  ultrax shampoo I previously ordered</li>
    <li> Hair is thicker then ever! I love ultrax labs and all there products now that i found something that works in weeks I will stay a loyal customer forever! goodbye thin hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hairline started disappearing because I get perms. I used this product, and it works after a few applications.  I&#x27;m always skeptical with my hair because not everything works with black&#x27;s people hair. Now, my hairline is coming back and its thicker than before.</li>
    <li> Great product! With a combination of the other Ultrax products the results on my hair are great! I would really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product that long, but I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference. It has definitely made my hair thicker and stronger plus it smells really good.</li>
    <li> Excellent produc.For the price it works very well.i would recomend to anyone wanting to regrow hair</li>
    <li> Awesome product and it smells good! My hair is thicker and fuller now because of it!</li>
    <li> The way it thickens hair is instantly,literally......The bottle is short but has a very good amount of quantity of serum.Smells clean and package came in excellent conditions.The hair even smells good and it provides a STRONGER and FIRMER hair.When you use it,leave a little for a tiny while then take it out.It looks clean and shines a bit as well.It is also non greasy so for those people that like the non greasy feature,thumbs up!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I was skeptical at first but the reviews were so good so I tried it anyway. I definitely noticed a thickening in my hair and my balding spots were less noticeable. I used it in conjunction with the shampoo and I think I am getting optimal results.  I’ve noticed less shedding as well. My hair defiantly feels like there is more volume to it. The serum itself doesn’t weigh down my hair or make it oily. Give this product a try!</li>
    <li> Helped my thin hair become full, thick and healthy in a short period of time.  It totally stopped the shedding and made my hair grow back. The serum is lightweight and does not leave any residue on your hair.  You should use the product daily on wet or dry hair.  My hair looks so healthy and shiny now from using this product.  Thank  you Ultrax Labs!</li>
    <li> 0 progress for whole bottle</li>
    <li> This product really works. I have fine thin hair and it was starting to thin out even more. Since I started using this product in January I have seen new hair growth, a whole lot of tiny new little hairs forming on my head. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I am a total skeptic when it comes to these type of hair products,  I&#x27;ve tried so many thickening serums, gels, sprays, creams, you name it and my hair always felt weighed down. Dry. Coated. Anything but natural. So when I  gave Ultrax Labs Hair Lush a try, I was totally blown away by  how natural and thick it felt, in a few short weeks.  (2 weeks to be exact). I kept trying to find something I didn&#x27;t like about the product, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong. I actually feel the opposite. I LOVE this product!  It truly has been the answer to my thin, flat hair!  I always felt I needed a body perm for my hair to give it some bounce and thickness.  After putting my poor, thin hair through that chemical treatment, I usually ended up with a number of split ends and stragglers that kind of broke off.  After using this Hair Lush, my hair feels and looks, healthier, bouncier and thicker, than ever before, with no residue at all.  Yay 👍</li>
    <li> The main ingredients in Ultrax Labs hair products are Keratin and Caffeine, the combination in the serum truly perks up roots, offer volume and vitality that hair follicles need to remain healthy and strong. Its worth using this product, you do not need a huge amount, I would highly recommend this product, for hair rejuvenation and strengthening alongside healthy diet ie. Sea kelp and such to re-nourish hair.</li>
    <li> Using breakthrough caffeine innovation technology, Ultrax Labs Hair Lush serum is a great addition to any hair regimen. Hair Lush, used in combination with other Ultrax Labs products, such as their caffeine shampoo, will do your hair wonders! This serum is lightweight, and does not make my hair sticky, gooey, or stiff like some products out there. Just as other Ultrax Labs products have been proven to work, the serum is sure to do it&#x27;s job; making your hair fuller, thicker, and more manageable.</li>
    <li> About two years ago when the keratin thermal treatments got really popular I hopped on board. I was fighting against my naturally thick frizzy curls and the keratin definitely won. Not only did it take away some of my vivacious curls but my hair was a flat and almost see through disaster. I could no longer straighten my hair because it looked way too thin. On a whim I ordered UL&#x27;s thickening serum but wasn&#x27;t really expecting much. However to my surprise I could instantly see an improvement. My hair was not only bouncy and full, but you could no longer see my scalp. If you are struggling with thin hair I am confident you will love this product. It will give your tresses the needed volume, and without the wait.</li>
    <li> I have used serums on my face for a long time, but never thought to try one for my hair.  I didn&#x27;t imagine it would make much of a difference; what can I say, I am a bit of a skeptic.  But not long after using this stuff, I noticed my hair seems a lot thicker, fuller, shinier and just plain healthy!  I definitely seem to be shedding less, too.  This product is legit.  I would recommend it to anyone with anything less than amazingly full, thick, shiny, healthy hair!</li>
    <li> Great product to layer with after a shower...adds extreme volume and density!  Trusted amazon seller-consistent with shipping and quality!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to complement my earlier purchase of the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge with Caffeine Shampoo. When I first purchased the product, I did not expect much since the product is a bit smaller than expected. However, it is so concentrated that you only need a small amount.  Within a week of daily using, my hair had a natural healthy shine and within a month, my hair was thicker and fuller than ever before.  It’s best to start using a small amount to see how the hair will react initially and to see if there’s any difference.  It helps to work the serum deep into the scalp with a nice long massage for the best results. I notice hair thickening relatively quickly. Its smells great and combined with the Hair Surge Shampoo works wonder. I recommend this product to everyone who is looking for a complete transformation that looks for a fuller and healthier hair.</li>
    <li> This leave-in formula for reducing hair loss and increasing hair growth is easy to use and provides real and visible results! Within days of using it, I noticed that my hair appeared thicker and the areas where my hair was thinning looked fuller. I am very pleased with the results and highly recommend this product. It ships fast, is high quality, works fast, and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but after having used it for over a month, I don&#x27;t really see any benefits to is.  Definitely not worth the money for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It came to my house even sooner than expected! I have tried a lot of leave in products to give my thin hair volume and this has definitely worked the best out of everything.  I also usually shed a lot of hair in the shower but it has been so much less since I began using this product. Just a dime size amount each day really does the trick. My hair smells so great and feels so soft. I am so impressed with this product I just ordered another bottle!</li>
    <li> This Thickening Serum is such an amazing product! It instantly does its job to make my hair really full, thick, and strong. As I have mentioned with the Ultrax Labs shampoo, caffeine does indeed stimulate hair follicle regrowth for thinning hair. This serum too would be great for people who have thin hair, because of the serum’s feature in improving the strength, texture, and volume of the hair based on scientific evidence. That’s why it really works!</li>
    <li> Thicker, fuller, healthier hair right away.  No heavy residue and does not require a lot to get results.  No breakage anymore.  Great results.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but what is very deceptive is that it indicates 4 ounces in the product description (both for product itself and for shipping weight).  The actual product is only 1.7 ounces.</li>
    <li> This product worked great along with this shampoo I bought for hair loss, my dad has them on order monthly. We both take some back to Nigeria to share with everyone.</li>
    <li> This product has been so amazing. It has made my hair thicker and stronger. The product smells great and every time you use it you only need a small coin size amount. Definitely will keep ordering this product because the results are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Bad, I think it actually worsened my hair loss. The scalp felt itchy and shinny. The volume and price us ridiculous but it doesn&#x27;t work so who cares, just don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> What a great product!!! The name says it all - HAIR LUSH!  Makes your hair feel fuller and softer. Gives an added shine to take years off that tired and dull appearance. My hair is very fine and does not grow very quickly. Since I have been using Ultrax Labs products, my hair is noticeably longer and just feels &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;. I am able to style my hair again! I get lots of compliments, too. In fact, I had dinner with a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in a few months and he kept commenting about the difference in my appearance that he couldn&#x27;t quite put his finger on. He said I was looking younger and more well rested. Nothing has changed in my life except my hair and I&#x27;m happy to say Ultrax Labs products are part of that change.</li>
    <li> Just brought this from a local beauty supply, i was a bit skeptical but after reading the reviews I decided to buy it.  I just put it in my hair there is a little tingling but I guess that&#x27;s normal.  I&#x27;m gonna keep using this for a few weeks to see what happens. :)</li>
    <li> I have always had thin hair, thinner hair than I would like at least. I never thought that full and radiant picturesque hair was within my reach. Trying to remedy this problem I have tried many different hair care treatments. Many of which I have not had luck with unfortunately. However my luck changed alas! With the discovery of the Ultrax Shampoo I started seeing an improvement. So I thought if that worked for me I would stick with their other products to get the extra “stride” towards perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results, results, results!&lt;br /&gt;Well that about sums it up without my detail, however that wouldn’t be much of a review if I just said that. As I said in my introduction I started with the Ultrax shampoo and saw good results from that. However my hair lacked the shine I was looking for. A shine, which the serum has given me. I would start out with the shampoo once a day as a “base coat” leaving it on 2-3 minuets before washing it out. After my shower I would take about a “pea sized” dot of the serum and applied it to my hair. It’s amazing the difference it makes, immediately. As an “after-care” product this thickening serum is all you could ask for and more. A little goes a long way with this serum, especially for a male. I could see this lasting my a long time of daily use. Even without using the Ultrax shampoo beforehand I saw I positive improvement using the serum on my hair. The results last thought the day without any greasy or oily residue left on my hair. I am happy to say that this serum has become part of my daily hair care emergency kit and has turned into something I cannot go without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it? Simply put, yes! I liked what I saw after just one use. If you’re looking for thicker hair than this can help you like it helped me. With such a little bit of serum going such a long way it is also pretty good value. Like others have said this is definitely worth buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have perfect picturesque hair that you could only dream for, and the Ultrax Labs hair care line has given me this. I am beyond happy with what I would call my “new” hair. I’ll keep my reviews updated with my continual use of the Ultrax series, however as for now I couldn’t be happier.</li>
    <li> Shedding has slowed wayyyy down to a crawl! I have been looking for a awesome product for years and i think i found it finally! You will love the smell that entangles you as you wash your hair and condition it with this product!The tingling sensation not only adds to the feeling from massaging the scalp,but it lets me know its working good! Make sure to follow the instructions and massage the product into the scalp. I apply it after using the shampoo and conditioner, but, it can be used at any point with wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> Hmmm I decided to get this, seeing as how I&#x27;ve already used Ultrax shampoo for a while now and it&#x27;s a nice bonus. Hair already feels thicker since using the shampoo so this adds a nice sheen to it. Just use a tiny amount and run it through your hair. Too much product and it&#x27;ll feel too thick and goopy. It&#x27;s a nice &amp;#34;accessory&amp;#34; to have. I don&#x27;t think I will use this every day, it&#x27;s pretty thick and I don&#x27;t want it to weigh down my hair but it&#x27;s good to know that I have a little extra kick to give my hair some fullness. Maybe I&#x27;ll get the conditioner too (I use a different brand), just to see how it does.</li>
    <li> I really do like this formula. I have male pattern baldness with mostly very,very fine shafts, and using this serum plumps up the thickness of my hair as promised. I use a medium amount after showering to ensure it goes straight to my scalp first and work it out towards the ends from there. It definitely makes my hair fuller-looking. Those long ultra wiry hairs are held in place and given a much lusher and, importantly, a neater appearance. I&#x27;m very happy with the look it provides, so far, and will be very satisfied if I can maintain what I have, but sparse areas are filling in some now, slowly and surely. I think keeping the follicles active is the key, and with the stimulating action of this formula they are able to maintain their vitality. I&#x27;ve lately gotten some positive compliments and feedback on my new look too. My team member at work asked what I was using and told me that it&#x27;s working for me and even asked where I got this serum, because she wants to buy it for her husband. So, obviosuly,  I feel really good about the results I&#x27;m getting with it.</li>
    <li> If your tired of looking older than your age and want to look 5-10 years younger than this is a MUST HAVE in your tools for youthfulness.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how well this works for my hair. I only have to use a small  amount on my hair and it makes it so shiny and healthy. Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is Awesome:-) it&#x27;s truly AMAZing &amp; dOES what it promises to do!</li>
    <li> A really good product, I used this with another product they have and its really helped me with some great results. Definitely worth the value</li>
    <li> For many years my hair has been thinning, but after using this product my hair is a thousand times thicker. I am very grateful for this product and would highly recommend to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This serum really does work and was very easy to use. I&#x27;ve had problems with hair loss for quite some time and this is one of the only products I&#x27;ve tried that actually worked and caused no irritation or effects. The price can&#x27;t be beat and it&#x27;s quality is impressive. I would definitely recommend it and plan on buying it again in the future. Shipping was fast and the overall value is totally worth it. Definitely recommend...</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to buy this product, but wanted to try it. Lucky I bought it. It is amazing! The first time I used it, I just apply to my hair and the smell was great. Not greasy, which I like. So far, I can see results. I will continue using this serum to get the result I want. It&#x27;s better that most product out there.</li>
    <li> This is a great leave-in product that has helped me with my thinning hair.  It has helped to thicken my hair as well as leave it smooth and shiny.  It&#x27;s a very nice product that doesn&#x27;t take much to get results, I only use a little dab and it definitely goes a long way.  I would highly recommend this product, especially if you&#x27;re looking for a product that will help keep your hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum. It has made my hair better in many different ways. It feels fuller, looks like i just walked out of the salon shine and it does not weigh your hair down.&lt;br /&gt;You just need a small amount so itll last quit awhile. I highly recommend the entire Ultrax line its phenomenal my hair has really gotten so much fuller and beautiful! Thank you Ultrax!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00HG1JFXY Ultrax Labs Hair Lush | Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment Formula Serum]]This is an amazing product. Good body and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. My hair is so long, but in letting it grow, it had lost some of it&#x27;s strength and shine. My hair had become dull and not as thick as I had hoped. I gave this product a try and now I have the hair I&#x27;ve been trying to get for years! My hair is strong thick and shiny! A must have for those who care about their hair.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something that would stimulate my hair growth on the top front of my head. It&#x27;s so embarrassing that I would have to use other products to cover up my spot areas. As soon as you massage this into your scalp, you can feel it working. I would recommend this to anyone who is struggling with hair loss. Give this a try and you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I found this product very helpful to my situation. I love the smell of this product as well. The serum goes on easily, and washes of my hands very easily too. I used a product once that didn&#x27;t come off my skin, and made them sticky and smell every weird. This isn&#x27;t the case. I wear glasses, and have a head set for work, and they both sit in the same spots on my head, and I feel like there is a bald spot or much less hair then the rest of my head. I put this on as the the directions said, maybe a little bit more haha, and after a few times I could see and feel a difference. My fair is back, and I don&#x27;t notice my thinning hair any more.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This leave in treatment is the best!  My hair feels 4 times fuller and thicker, I use it everyday.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very good product that gives my hair a healthy radiance. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it and it takes a few seconds to apply. I wish I had this around when I suffered from alopecia. My hair is very thin and usually falls flat. With this serum, I don&#x27;t need much else to give it the boost it needs.</li>
    <li> I have been using Ultrax products now for a while.  I am so happy with the results.  They make a really good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to buy the Hair Lush and give it a try also.  It&#x27;s concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot the product and it&lt;br /&gt;lasts a pretty long time.  You will immediately feel the difference in your hair!  After blow drying my hair I can feel the fullness,&lt;br /&gt;softness and my hair feels so healthy.  It&#x27;s a great feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Hair Lush for a couple of weeks now and I am completely happy with the results.  After years of searching for&lt;br /&gt;products to help me with my thinning hair hair and on going hair loss it is nice to know I have found some products that&lt;br /&gt;are working for me.  Anyone who has problems similar to mind should really give this a try.  I&#x27;m feeling pretty good about&lt;br /&gt;my hair now--better than I have in years.</li>
    <li> Returning this product  it&#x27;s very useless it does smell very good but then that it&#x27;s no good use doesn&#x27;t help to thicken hair at all</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Advanced Caffeine Hair Thickening Formula Serum works just like a serum that is used on the skin to plump up wrinkles.  It plumps the hair shaft to make the hair fuller and thicker, something that someone with fine, thin hair can appreciate. Used with other Ultrax products like their shampoo and supplements, you can expect to see fuller, thicker feeling hair and less hair loss.</li>
    <li> Though the actual amount is small  the product is potent. Directions indicate that it can be generously applied. The scent is minty pleasant and feels good to the scalp. It does about a week to see results which is pretty quick--especially if you&#x27;ve ever used other brands. Thinking that my results are so positive because I also use the Ultrax Labs Caffeine Shampoo.  Surprised they can keep a product this valuable in stock!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush | Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment is a great compliment to Ultrax Lab’s hair stimulating shampoo and conditioner. The serum is specially formulated to thicken hair up to 150%. It’s a leave-in treatment, so it has plenty of time to sit and go to work. The serum comes in a convenient pump bottle, so all you have to do is pump a little onto your fingertips and gently massage it into your scalp. It’s concentrated, so a little bit goes a long way. There’s a slight tingling when it’s first applied to let you know it’s working. It’s not an unpleasant feeling at all. The serum has a light scent to it, though not offensive, and it dissipates as the product is absorbed.  The serum can be used once or twice a day and the more frequently you use it, the quicker you&#x27;ll see results. There are directions on the back of the bottle, but basically just massage it into your scalp. It doesn’t matter if your hair is wet or dry when you apply it and the formula is non-greasy, so your hair will still look and feel clean after you use it. Like any hair restoration product, it should be used daily for an extended period of time. Results might take a while depending on the degree of your hair loss. Besides stimulating hair follicles to produce new hair, it also adds fulness and body to any remaining hair that you have. The formula is effective for men or women.  Disclaimer: I received this product for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> All of the Ultrax Labs Hair products I have tried have worked phenomenally for me. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> This product is very good for frizzy and thin hair. After start using it, i got better result as well the shine in hair. My hair stop falling and more manageable. This serum work best on my hair and smell good as well. My hair look thicker and more beautiful !! Love this product !!</li>
    <li> As always I&#x27;m very skeptical of these sort of products but decided I had to try something since an area of my hair was scotched off by a hot comb.  Some growth was seen with the shampoo I used but then I tried this and it&#x27;s thickening fairly nice, the length is a slow process but still much faster than other products I&#x27;ve tried.  Best of all is the strands are not frail when they regrow and thus this why I&#x27;m rating 5 stars. The smell isn&#x27;t the best but the other products I use masked it well so I don&#x27;t shed tears over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again I always like to stress that I deep condition my hair once a month and keep shampooing to minimum, the routine you used in your hair will effect the rate of success of any product you use as will the texture of your hair so your time frame may or may not match mine.</li>
    <li> Needed an adjunct to my hair regime and had success with Ultrax Surge Shampoo, so naturally, this serum from Ultrax was a good fit. The bottle is small, but the product is very concentrated and a little goes a long way. With a small dollop, my hair has added luster, shine and tamed fly-a-ways without the added weight. Smells great, too.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I feel that it work as advertised. The sent is minty.  Good product. Hair appears fuller</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum along with the shampoo and vitamins, and I can say it has definitely made an improvement!  I am very happy with the results, and I trust Ultrax products!</li>
    <li> I was experiencing hair loss and thinning.  By chance I came across Ultrax Labs Hair Lush.  I decided to try it and have been using every since My hair has improved tremendously, no more hair loss or thinning.  I recommend Hair Lush to anyone who is going thru hair loss issues.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for products I buy online but this is my second bottle of Ultrax hair thickening serum and anyone with thinning or naturally thin hair needs to know what an amazing product this is. I have been using this product for months now and could not be happier with the results. This serum not only makes my hair look and feel thicker, it adds a beautiful shine and bounce to my locks that other serums have failed to do. Because my hair was so thin, it was hard to avoid the greasy and oily look and feel other serums used to leave behind; they were a complete waste of money. You only need a dime-sized amount so this little  bottle will last you a while and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I use it almost every day and it leaves no sticky buildup. The more I use it, the more I notice a different in the thickness and volume of my hair. I absolutely love this product and all the wonderful compliments I receive now because of it!</li>
    <li> I have been blessed with finding my way towards the Ultrax Labs Hair Lush/Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment and this product gives me exactly what I need when I need it! I have suffered for way too long with trying to obtain and maintain the thickness that I crave for my hair to have and it has been a serious struggle until I came in contact with the Ultrax Labs Hair Lush/Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment. I faithfully adhere to the instructions concerning the frequency of using the treatment and I must say that the results are stunning! I am finally able to seriously notice my hairline increasing instead of decreasing and my hair is coming in full and beautiful. I am blown away by the results!</li>
    <li> This is a really cool product. I expected it to be a thick serum and reek of coffee scent but it is actually water-based and has no scent at all. That&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s a leave-in treatment and not a fancy body booster. It takes no more than a minute to apply and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair. This little bottle should last for a good amount of time. I only need a tiny amount and so far so good!</li>
    <li> 82% off &amp; prime? I&#x27;d be a sucker not to order this. It&#x27;s been about two weeks since I&#x27;ve been using their other product, &amp;#34;Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo&amp;#34; I feel that the treatment has been going well and has done great gains for my hair. So I decided to test the waters and give this one a try for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s from the same company I didn&#x27;t feel that I had to wait to switch out my shampoos slowly to introduce this one in. Plus it&#x27;s always good to use the same company of products, just better results in my opinion. After the first use I feel that it has a more conditioning sensation vs the shampoo. I get more of a shine with this thickening treatment and feel the difference when I run my fingers through my hair. I also recently dyed my hair burgandy and it doesn&#x27;t leave it dry or flaky at all. Still no hair loss from both products and it&#x27;s a great addition to restoring hair after damage like being in the sun too long or having your hair dyed. I&#x27;m really happy with the results for this one and for the price, it&#x27;s a must have !</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, I noticed less hair falling out in just one use. This product is def. worth the money and you only need just a little quarter size amount per use. I will never buy John Frieda products again after using this just once. I love love love it!! also the shampoo is great and I noticed a difference after the first wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with thinning hair issues for quite sometime now.  Like many of you, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there and have spent hundreds trying to get some thickness and body back into my locks.  Before trying Hair Lush I had been using Nioxin&#x27;s Diamax.  I noticed some improvement in the fullness of my hair, but it honestly was not worth the money I had been spending on it.  I came across Hair Lush while doing some product research for my thinning problem.  In just 5 days after using it, I have decided to say goodbye to Nioxin--and all the other hair-thickening wannabes!  I have seen a remarkable difference in the overall volume of my hair, and it&#x27;s actually noticeable how much thicker the individual strands are.  This &#x27;miracle serum&#x27;, as I like to call it, has a very nice consistency.  Most other products I&#x27;ve tried have been very sticky and have caused scalp irritation.  But Hair Lush is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;build up&#x27; feeling on my scalp or hair follicles.  I use it after the shower when my hair is still wet and then dry/style as usual.  It is definitely worth the price, and I can tell that it is going to last me a lot longer than the Nioxin ever did.  Don&#x27;t you just love it when you find the perfect hair product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a truly remarkable product, and I recommend it to anyone who deals with thin or thinning hair!</li>
    <li> i love using this product not just because it really works by making your hair grow and thicken, but because it also makes your hair look awesome, more manageable and smells great. i highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I had been giving up on keeping my hair until I tried Hair Lush, but since I started using it, I have been thrilled with the results from this product. My hair feels thicker and definitely has more body. The alcohol was drying my hair a bit at first; however, once I renewed my normal conditioning routine, I haven&#x27;t noticed it again. I can put it in my hair right out of the shower and feel it stimulating my scalp. I think I might be on the right track to getting my hair back to where it belongs.</li>
    <li> Really great product. I will likely continue to use this even if my hair stops thinning. I noticed results within just a week or so: shinier, thicker, softer, etc. A little goes a long way. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really love this product ! At first i wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work but it did much more than work. It saved my hair. I noticed less shedding, more thickness , and some faster growth. Also my split ends have lessened. I really am thankful for this product , so glad I took the chance and ordered it ! High recommended!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do a thing, waste of money</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is amazing product! Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write online reviews but I&#x27;ve recently been experiencing hair loss and, having tried numerous products, feel compelled to share my experience with everyone. This product is great! It feels beautiful on the scalp and the results are fast and incredibly impressive! It seems like my hair is even thicker and healthier than before I started experiencing hair loss. Your hair is a precious thing and you should go to lengths to protect it! I would highly recommend this product to people with thinning hair or those veering towards full on baldness.</li>
    <li> For many years now I have been experiencing hair loss and thinning. And I am only 28! After trying numerous products, I began to give-up an felt as though I would some day end up bald. Even after seeking the opinion of many medical professionals. I heard about this product through a friend and I notice a difference within three weeks! My hair stopped falling throughout the day and in large quantities while showering! Its so great to find a product that works!</li>
    <li> A great product. It helps with the thinning and the breakage of hair. It helps restore the hair and brings the life back into hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey but good!</li>
    <li> Thicker, healthier hair is what I got after using this hair lush product. Just after the first time using Ultax Labs Hair Lush, I felt as if my hair was instantly revitalized. This price is nothing compared to what some health and beauty stores are charging for their products. This hair lush product is a good buy and it is very effective.</li>
    <li> After the birth of my second child, my hair went from thick to almost non-existent. My hair was thinning at a rapid pace. I tried almost every product out there and nothing seemed to work. Well, after only two applications of Ultra Labs Hair Lush, I can already see a difference. There is hope for my hair still! The serum is very light on the hair. A great product at a great price. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Immediate results. Hair looks better than it has ever has. Hair looks and feels fuller and thicker.</li>
    <li> My hair had been fried and not growing at all and now i need a haircut at least twice a month! It&#x27;s got a tingle so you know it works. Awesome product. You should buy today</li>
    <li> $50 for nothing.  Doesn&#x27;t work.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it.. it starts work with in weeks of use. am super happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> This is a great follow up treatment to Ultrax shampoo and conditioner; it leaves my hair feeling and looking healthier and fuller than ever before. I definitely recommend that you try the shampoo and conditioner as well as this product so you get the whole effect. The only downside to this awesome product? I wish it came in a larger container because I go through it so fast because I use it every day - it can be used on both dry or wet hair. Buy it in bulk!</li>
    <li> This hair lush is fantastic. The caffeine serum is lightweight and naturally formulated. It applies easily, leaves no gunky residue and leaves no toxic smell characteristic of other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lush feels healthy to use - it tingles the scalp slightly upon application to indicate regenerative effects. As a leave in product, it stays in your hair throughout the day and produces beautiful results in terms of volume and softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thickening can be expected in a week and significant regeneration after a month. Pair the fact that it actually WORKS with a very good cost per ounce, this is a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Ultrax Labs for another great product.</li>
    <li> Recent studies prove that caffeine stimulates hair growth. Scientists estimate that 60 cups of coffee a day would be needed for significant amounts to reach follicles in the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found an effective leave in serum that works without drinking 60 cups of coffee!!!! Hair Lush has transformed my thinning hair. I now have thicker and fuller hair.</li>
    <li> I tried the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge, actually on my second bottle now because of the reaction it seems to have on my hair, so when I heard about this Hair Lush product by Ultrax Labs, I had to give it a try! Let me say that I am extremely happy with the one punch that both products hand out! I have found my hair to be in better shape now then it had been when I was in my late thirties, early forties. It appears thicker without the usual hair loss that would come off my hairbrush every time I brushed my hair. It doesn&#x27;t seem to fall out and what does is easily cover or not noticeable because of the new growth and fullness that is there. Great product!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and already my hair is thicker and has a shine to it that it hasn&#x27;t had in a long time. I&#x27;ve noticed less hair in the drain when I shower. I&#x27;m so happy with this product! My hair looks so healthy now!!!</li>
    <li> The ultrax formula really makes my hair thicker and I don&#x27;t wash it everyday and it keeps volume without feeling greasy and dirty. I thought my hair would go limp in the rain but it didn&#x27;t, this formula just wakes up my hair from the roots and I need that!</li>
    <li> The reviewers of Hair Lush have exposed themselves as frauds, probably hired by Ultrax Labs. They&#x27;ve created almost 300 five-star reviews of this product. Do you know why it&#x27;s obvious to anyone with a critical mind that they are fake? If you read and compare them with an eye for psychology (I happen to work in mental health), you&#x27;ll see that every single one is 100% positive. The writing, grammar, and syntax are similar, AND they contain similar content. Now, come on, folks! People who review hair products are critical thinkers. They&#x27;ve usually tried many products before this one and usually their reviews reflect that. Finally, notice how many of the one and two star reviews - even the helpful ones - have been overwhelmingly disliked. Raise any eyebrows? Amazon needs to do something ASAP about this obvious fraud being perpetuated by Ultrax Labs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product and after about three weeks, saw a tiny difference in thickening, but it&#x27;s a far cry from the &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; results the reviews promise. Also, if you follow the directions and use a generous amount, you&#x27;ll use this product up in just two weeks!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great because it is an added boost to tired and over processed hair and it fits right in your purse. I also like that it wasn&#x27;t heavy like I just got caught in a light rainfall. The smell was lovely, like all good hair gels should be and the results HAPPEN! It doesn&#x27;t happen over night or anything, I don&#x27;t think I noticed anything until the 3rd week, but if you are patient and use it every day it will PAY OFF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want your hair back to its former glory, try this product. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This is an easy to use product. You simply pump it into your hand and then massage on your scalp. I was worried that it would make my hair oily but it did not. After you put it in you can style your hair as normal. It also has a very nice light scent.</li>
    <li> My wife has been so impressed with this product in combination with the shampoo and conditioner. Her hair loss has slowed and her hair&#x27;s thickness is incredible, couldn&#x27;t be a happier customer!</li>
    <li> I am an avid user of Ultrax products, and this one is fantastic. For virtually half off the regular price, you are able to get fast, regrowing hair. My self-esteem is already up! Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is the thickest and fullest it&#x27;s been in a number of years recently. I added Hair Lush to my usual hair routine and have been absolutely thrilled with the results! Hair is thicker, and not loosing nearly as much as I had been! I really wish I had found this product years ago! The serum is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or sticky or anything out of the ordinary. Definitely would suggest for anyone having hair loss/thinning issues.</li>
    <li> This product is the bomb dot com. I was surprised how fast I received results from it. It is easy to use and has a minty smell to it. It is not messy to apply to your hair and it really works. My hair is not weighed down and still maintains its glow. It also still has plenty of body and movement.  I am satisfied with my purchase and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! Finally, something that works!! I&#x27;ve tried other hair thickening products and none have worked like Hair Lush! I have used it as directed and my hair has gone thick from thin!!! It&#x27;s truly amazing! The results are so noticeable and it costs a lot less than many of those over the counter products, that never worked for me! You must try it to believe it! I&#x27;ll be getting some for mother for sure! Thanks makers of Hair Lush!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing that Ultrax has been able to produce this awesome product. Over the course of a couple weeks, my hair showed signs of becoming thicker with no negative side effects. I have been able to use this product with my regular shampoos with no issues. I recommend this product to everyone who is struggling with thin hair and wants to see a difference. Another thing that is great about this product is that it&#x27;s such an easy process to apply, you just dispense a small amount and it doesn&#x27;t drip everywhere so you&#x27;re able to utilize every drop. Making my hair thicker has made it easier to style my hair with gel which is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Not sure how well product is working yet.</li>
    <li> This is a great product like the Ultra Labs Hair Surge Caffeine+ Hair Recovery Stimulating Shampoo.  These two products are good to buy together if you have thin, lifeless or dull hair.  Many of us know that caffeine wakes us up in the morning, and it also wakes up the hair and stimulates the scalp.  I never thought about using a product with caffeine until recently for hair, but it really works.  So, have some coffee in the morning and add this product with caffeine to your hair.  Your body and your hair will both be more alive.</li>
    <li> I love the luxurious feeling of this serum, the scent, and the way it leaves my hair! Another great product from the brand I&#x27;ve come to love and trust.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference right away!  I love the feel and look of my hair</li>
    <li> Ok .....what happened is that ...I bought it and was not sure if it is good decision......to my wonder.....it showed results in 2 to 3 weeks....and I have now baby hair growth....I am 50 plus.....and male bald pattern was expanding....now...go into detail..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@@@@ I only used it in the middle of my scalp...&lt;br /&gt;@@@@ I did not use too much a a time..&lt;br /&gt;@@@@ No hair growth...where there were no roots( I guess)&lt;br /&gt;@@@@ Baby hair growth happened away from middle back ..towards Front.....&lt;br /&gt;@@@@ Now in one jar...I have Baby hair in a Month or So.....&lt;br /&gt;..........................................................&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion................If U dont have roots left...I am sure it will not work....&lt;br /&gt;................................It works where there are Roots.....and will surely work at thinning Hair...&lt;br /&gt;Important.......~~~~ It causes too much sensitivity in my hands ..touching sensation increases....little bothering...effect of Caffeine..&lt;br /&gt;..............................It tightens scalp ....again caffeine effect.....&lt;br /&gt;....................................&lt;br /&gt;Now I know the secret....I ordered pure Caffeine....will find what to add to make my own....since it is way too more expensive....!!!!&lt;br /&gt;..........................................rafiraza@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;https://www.facebook.com/shaaair</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping it would help with the lack of shine &amp; thinning of my once thick hair &amp; my goodness! This stuff works, not only did it make my hair amazingly naturally shiny &amp; make my hair thicker, but it also made my hair stronger which was an unexpected plus for my split ends that just fall out. I just love this, its perfect &amp; at an amazingly affordable price. I will definitely recommend this serum to anyone in need of a solution ^_^</li>
    <li> This is a great companion to the ultrax hair shampoo.  As I get younger with age, the edges of my hair around the scalp area have been thinning.  This product helps control the thinning.  It&#x27;s applied every other day after a few weeks usage to help train my hair follicles.  Ultrax has provided a proven method to a cause most &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; people my age are struggling to maintain.  Great Product!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been struggling with thinning or lost  hair, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this amazing product.  After only several weeks of use, there is a very noticeable improvement to both the look and feel of my hair.  I have used quite a few other hair restoration products but none of them delivered the kind of results that Ultrax has.  Don&#x27;t listen to the naysayers, this product works and works fast!  And it&#x27;s so easy to apply and has a very pleasant fragrance.  Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this with Ultrax Hair Surge and I have to say that I didn&#x27;t realize my hair could be so thick! I&#x27;m growing my hair out and the back part seemed to take forever to look like I had hair back there.  After using this for a week or so, I could already tell that my hair was growing so much fuller (and quicker) than it used to!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush | Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment Formula Serum works exactly as promised!!! My hair has grown very rapidly!!! I use the serum as directed. It gives a tingling feeling that I definitely enjoy that is when I know that it is working!!! I adore the fact that I don&#x27;t have to wash it out because I love the way it makes my hair smells and how light weight it makes my hair as well!!!&lt;br /&gt;I give all of Ultra Labs Hair Lush products 10 plus stars!!! My hair is longer, thicker, its growing so quickly and has so much volume, its beautiful and FABULOUS!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after using other products from the same line and they worked, so I thought I would use this to enhance the process. I love what it has done! I use it after I use the shampoo, I prefer to use it on wet hair so that I can dry it and style as normal. It does not weigh my hair down or cause it to be oily. You just massage it into your scalp and let it do its work. How much more simple can it be. The product has made my hair thicker and fuller. It&#x27;s really easy and convenient to use.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky nor oily.  Smells amazing and best if all it WORKS!  Hair is thickening,  less breakage and finally growing!</li>
    <li> Great smelling, works well and easy to travel with. Keep hair healthy, thick &amp; luscious!</li>
    <li> I will say it again, you JUST CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG WITH ULTRAX LABS!!!! I have been using their products a few months now, and I love them. I started with their Hair Surge (Extra Strength) Shampoo, after my stylist recommended it to me. Then, a couple of months after seeing great results I also purchased their Hair Maxx DHT vitamins. Now I&#x27;m proud to tell you that I have also been using their Hair Lush Serum for the past three weeks.    Ohh, what can I say? As soon as you massage it into your scalp, you start feeling this pleasant tingling, and you can just feel it working. After a couple of weeks you can see the results, and although  it is not listed as heat protection for your hair I swear I feel that it protects my hair from the heat of the flat iron and hair dryer too!    I will recommend these products to anyone and everyone. If you really want to see results, just try them. I must say though, that the reason I believe I have seeing  great results it&#x27;s because I have been committed and followed their recommendations precisely. Also because I am combining their products, because they really do complement each other, and have this sort of (and forgive for sounding cheesy) \\&quot;together we&#x27;re stronger\\&quot; and \\&quot;superpower \\&quot; effect. The results on my hair is absolutely, 100% satisfying. I am a costumer for life!</li>
    <li> Caffeine has been proven to help balding men and women regrow some hair. Research published in the International Journal of Dermatology concludes that caffeine is &amp;#34;a stimulator of human hair growth&amp;#34;. With this product, you can focus on the areas where you want the re growth. This product is very effective.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no results</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product! I was in the market for something that would make the thinner areas of my hair match the fuller areas while still giving my hair a nice sheen. Well, this product does exactly that! After a week of using it I started to notice the difference and my boyfriend even mentioned it. It&#x27;s been about a month now and my hair looks fuller, healthier and it feels stronger! It&#x27;s a small bottle but a little goes a long way! I&#x27;ll certainly be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Very, Very Small bottle for the high cost.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair greasy and stiff looking.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the same time as the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Shampoo several weeks ago. I have been scrubbing in the serum after I used the shampoo, and the combination of the two has worked wonders. My hair feels stronger, and no longer breaks like it used to. I can tell my hair is thicker, just like it used to be. I used to scratch my head, and hair would fall out, but that is no longer the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very concentrated, so there is no need to use a large amount at once; it’s best to use the recommended amount, and make sure it lasts as long as possible. Using more won’t help you at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely going to continue purchasing this product (as well as the rest of the Ultrax Labs line)</li>
    <li> I have just started using Ultrax Labs Hair Lush | Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment Formula Serum and already I am noticing a difference.  My hair has become thinner with age and was falling out when I shampoo.  I was constantly cleaning hair out of the bathroom shower drain.  I am using this product along with the Shampoo by the same company and I am noticing a difference already.  My hair seems to have more volume and has a fuller appearance.  I was hesitant of using this product as I was not sure it would work but I am happy that I got it.  I am looking forward to continued use of this product and future results.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is losing their hair or has thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Personally, I have been using Ultrax Labs products for the past few months, including Hair Maxx pills, and  Hair Surge Shampoo. This is supplemental, and I have been applying it daily for nearly 60 days now. I am noticing more fullness, and it brings out the natural shine of my hair. If you want thicker hair, and not just the &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; of thicker hair, I highly recommend using this for real results.</li>
    <li> Love this hair product! Smells amazing! Super thin gel so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it greasy. Easy to apply and massage in scalp. After I apply the product and blow dry my hair, my roots have so much volume. I can definitely tell a difference in my hair after only using it a few times. Can&#x27;t wait to see how much more volume my hair gets as I continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I just want to start off by saying this stuff is amazing, I started loosing my hair a few months back to the point where people noticed and it really started bringing down my self esteem, I have tried other products in the past but nothing compares to the power of this treatment. Very shortly after starting to use it, I and people around me noticed the difference, then I started having my friends ask me what i did to get my hair back, They thought i spent thousands of dollars at a specialist, when i told them what i used 2 of my buddies order some for them selfs, they noticed they were not balding but starting to thin out on top and decided to stop it before it got to late or to much damage was already done. And for the price why not. It does not have a strong chemical smell like a lot of other products do and it really works, plus with amazon you don&#x27;t have to worry about being embarrassed buying it at a store, just gets shipped right to your home, I defiantly  recommend this to anybody thinking about finding a solution to thinning and balding hair and my friends would agree.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a great improvement in my hair. My hair is not only thicker but much healthier. I highly recommend that if you have thinning hair you try this product! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  I apply to my hair after my shower, which I use Ultrax shampoo and conditioner. I instantly feel my hair become stronger and thicker after applying the serum! And I noticed less hair coming out in comb while brushing. I highly recommend this serum for men and women!</li>
    <li> Love Ultra Labs and their hair growth products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow I was able to convince the bf to use this as opposed to the Rogain I got him years ago.  He loves it.  Along with the caffeinated shampoo, the two is a killer combo.  His hair is already growing back on the thinning/balding area on top of his scalp!!!  I took a pic and showed him, he&#x27;s impressed also.  He said when he runs his hands thru his hair, it feels much thicker and fuller, compared to anything else hes used before.  And it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks or less!  This product is very promising and he will keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, don&#x27;t need a lot, as long as you cover your whole head or needed areas and massage the serum in, you&#x27;re good to go.  And keeping up is def key.  Continue it and you should see some results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market, and this is the only product that I notice huge results from.  It gives you a nice tingly feeling and smells super.  After using this only ONCE, I could not help but notice an increase in shine, bounce, and general healthiness.  Then after using it everyday for only a month, my individual hair strands were so much thicker than I&#x27;ve seen in years, like having my childhood hair thickness back!  I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.  My once damaged and thinned hair is now beautiful, bouncy, and thick again.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This product is totally worth every penny, and the bottle goes a long way.  Hair Lush doesn&#x27;t promise anything it won&#x27;t deliver.  Solid product, it&#x27;s worth a shot if you&#x27;ve given up in the hair department.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend using it with the shampoo and conditioner, but if you can only buy one, I&#x27;d say buy this one. It smells great and tingles a bit, so you know it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ve been using the two for a few weeks now and I have a noticeable difference in the thickness of my hair. I&#x27;ve always had the thinnest hair and someone said to me yesterday, &amp;#34;wow, you have a lot of hair&amp;#34;...never heard that one before!! I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Ultrax Hair Maxx product and got great results... so when I saw this Ultrax Labs Hair Lush thickening treatment, I decided to give it a try. I was surprised at how little you have to use (which was a bonus because the bottle seemed sort of small). But when I used it for the first time, I saw why... a little goes a long way and you only need it on the roots. I love the pleasant tingling I feel on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended it to several of my friends and I highly recommend it to anyone (man or woman) who is experiencing hair loss. I tried the commercial products for thinning hair, but none gave me the results in the short amount of time that this product has. It also seems to make my hair look fuller.</li>
    <li> Product has stopped the hair loss caused by thyroid cancer. I am very impressed as was my significant other, who I bought this for. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I decided to try Hair Lush after using their Hair Surge shampoo and seeing a big difference. My thin, straight and flat hair is especially awful in the winter and I got in the habit of just wearing a ponytail all the time. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments since using their products! I&#x27;ve thrown out the scrunchie and am loving the new thickness and luster my hair now has! I&#x27;ve used other leave-in treatments, but they&#x27;ve always left a residue on my hair, but not this! I&#x27;m getting rid of my hot rollers! Thank you Ultrax!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it prevents hair loss but it does add volume where applied if I blow dry it!</li>
    <li> When my mother began to notice that her hair was thinning, we immediately began looking for solutions. We came across this product which seemed promising but a little after she started using it, she began to tell me how thick her hair felt. We even noticed less shedding when she would wash her hair.  I think this product works wonders, so happy to have it. Hope it works for you too !</li>
    <li> This is a great finishing product for the Ultrax shampoo &amp; conditioner combination ... a perfect trifecta!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the other Ultrax products, you can feel a tingling sensation on your scalp after applying the product indicative that something is in the works.  For me, that&#x27;s a crop of new growth hair after years of trying other hair restoration products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to follow the instructions and massage the product into the scalp.  I apply it after using the shampoo and conditioner, but, it can be used at any point ... wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of us with hair loss issues, this product is definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for a bit over a month, I recently added the conditioner and now this product. I&#x27;m really happy with the results. The triple-threat approach really works.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely a miracle. Within the first week I noticed fuller, healthier hair right away. Also, the serum leaves no odd residue, oiliness, or smell and feels as if it wasn’t applied in the first place. The nice thing is that the serum has a very rich quality to it, so you only need to use a little bit since it goes a long way. Thus, you get the most for your money and get a trusted product. The caffeine also leaves an invigorating boost to my hair and scalp. I apply the serum as part of my normal routine after I’ve washed my hair so that it absorbs and sets in evenly. Since I can control the amount, I put slightly more in areas with less hair so as to even out any patches. My hair is now stronger, less dried out, and contains fewer split ends. I’ve also noticed less hair collected in my brush on a daily basis. I love this serum and would highly recommend it to both men and women that want healthier hair immediately. I’ve never felt better and more confident about my appearance and no longer hide my hair away. I’ve discovered a new lifetime hair product!</li>
    <li> This product is truly worth every penny ! Works and it doesnt have a bad scent to it! Bought this product for my mother and she&#x27;s very fond of it and will buy again. You will not be disappionated with this product. A great serum for hair loss ! Stop reading and buy this product !</li>
    <li> Great product.  I was a bit hesitant at first but I heard good things about it from some friends. Everything they told me was true.  It worked great. After just a few uses my hair was feeling and looking much thicker.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous, it gives such great strength and texture back to your hair, if used properly it gives your hair the body and thickness back. I would buy more of this.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, noticed a difference within the first week. I use this in combination with the hair surge caffeine shampoo, this also has caffeine which makes me think it&#x27;s double duty with hair growth. You only need a small amount, and it smells great. Very light, no build up of product like other brands can do. Will definitely recommend this to mother in law who suffers from thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Thin no more. This product is fab and did not mess up my regular hair style.  You only need to use a small amount and the aroma was almost non-existent. My hair is noticeably thicker because of this product.</li>
    <li> Finally, I have found a product that is working for my hair loss.  I have wasted a lot of time and money on many types of pills, shampoos, etc., that claim I will regrow my hair.  I am in my late fifties. Have always had thin, fine hair. In my thirties, I began loosing hair.  When I wash my hair, I would have a small palm full of hair in my hand! The top front of my head and the back crown are the worst and so embarrassing!  I have been using this product for two months now.  It took awhile, but I have started to see improvement in the front top of my head.  It isn&#x27;t full hair growth, but it isn&#x27;t as sparse as it was prior to using Hair Lush. What I did notice right away was that my hair felt and looked thicker and fuller. It is much like the result when using a mousse or gel in your hair. I have kept up using this product and finally I can see it was worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many others, yes, this is expensive for such a small bottle.  Yes, it is difficult to get this product directly to the scalp without some of it getting caught up in your hair.  And, like some others have stated, I do have an itchy scalp. I thought perhaps my scalp is itchy because of new hair growth and the follicles being stimulated to begin to grow new hair.  Don&#x27;t know.  Just my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know these different hair growth products will not work for everybody.  I have tried high rated products and stayed with them for between two and four months hoping for some indication that it was working for me.  None of these did, though many people claimed great success.  All I can say that this product is beginning to work for me.</li>
    <li> This product repairs hair follicles and stimulates hair growth! With hair loss from constant coloring, this is the perfect solution! The concentrated caffeine formula replenishes what&#x27;s needed for your scalp to heal. Excellent for me and it will definitely be amazing for you! Great product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I can not talk enough about how great this product is. It is a must have for all people that suffer from hair loss.</li>
    <li> I AM A VERY PICKY PERSON WHEN IT COMES TO PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET,FOR HAIR LOSS I AM ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A GREAT PRODUCT,.AND I FOUND IT. THIS PRODUCT NOT ONLY SUCCEDED,MY EXPECTATIONS, AND NEEDS. I BELIEVE THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST ON THE MARKET.FOR HAIR GROWTH.I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT,BECAUSE IT WORKS,FOR ME AND I KNOW THAT IT WILL WORK FOR YOU AS WELL ON A SCALE OF 1-10 ITS A TEN HANDS DOWN GREAT PRODUCT FOR ANYONE,SUFFERING FROM HAIR LOSS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with thinning hair for a long period of time and tried several different products before I discovered Ultrax Labs Hair Lush. I strongly recommend this product to anyone with fine or thin hair. After using the product, my hair is thicker and healthier. I was amazed with the difference. I enjoy the fact that I notice a change in my hair after the second use. The product left my hair  bouncy and shiny without the oil build up.  This is an incredible product. I recommend this product to anyone who is battling thinning or shedding hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe it works , have used it as instructed , run out of it very fast&lt;br /&gt;such a small amount that I would have to use a half of the bottle to be able to put it on the whole scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is non greasy / and lightweight - one star for this</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner combo is amazing. Glad I added this serum to my regimen to get my hair back into a healthy, full look after so much hair loss. It keeps my hair from feeling dry and frizzy now that winter has hit and I am so grateful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is pleasant consistency, pliable, and smells great. It doesn&#x27;t just stick to your fingers like a syrup like some serums do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you should expect with Ultrax products, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is well packaged and I have never received a damaged item.</li>
    <li> I can safely say that I was pleasantly surprised by this leave-in treatment! I&#x27;ve used other products from Ultrax in the past and they have worked really well but I was a little skeptical if this would cut it. So, I can honestly say this is not some magical overnight serum. The changes I&#x27;ve noticed were not immediate day one changes. I had to use the product for a week before I noticed a change, and after the first month everyone else begun to notice too. This a reliable, easy to use, daily treatment for thinning hair. It goes a long way and is priced fairly. I can recommend anyone who is bald, balding, or just has thin hair to give this a try. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had fine, thin hair all of my life. But after trying this product I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is so much fuller and thicker. It just feels like I&#x27;ve got a lot more hair. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I can honestly  say that I was pleasantly surprised by this leave-in treatment! I&#x27;ve used other products from Ultrax in the past and they have worked  well but I was a little skeptical if this would cut it, because of leave-in feature. I can  say this is not some magical overnight serum. The changes I&#x27;ve noticed were not immediate day one changes. I had to use the product for a week before I noticed a change, and after the first month everyone else begun to notice too. This a reliable, easy to use, daily treatment for thinning hair. It goes a long way and is priced fairly. I can recommend anyone who is bald, balding, or just has thin hair to give this a try. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This serum feels sooo luxurious! Not only do I suffer from thin hair, but my ends are incredibly damaged and brittle. I am a big fan of the Ultrax shampoo, and it is fantastic for growth and thickening, but this serum is amazing at keeping it HEALTHY. I can definitely see a difference in the thickness of my hair since incorporating this product as well. Usually, I shy away from serums because my hair tends to be oily, but this product is light enough that my hair looks clean and soft. I&#x27;m overall incredibly satisfied with this line!</li>
    <li> I was already really impressed with the Ultrax Labs shampoo for thinning hair, but this additional hair treatment is also a great product to thicken hair, to stop hair loss and to start re-growth. I really can&#x27;t believe the difference it makes in my hair. At the place where I part my hair, I used to be able to easily see my scalp, but not anymore. Plus my hair just looks so healthy and really full of life. Not only does it have a really pleasant tingling sensation when I apply it, but it seems to wake-up my whole head. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just the &amp;#34;power of suggestion&amp;#34; since the product has a lot of caffeine in it, or if I&#x27;m really feeling that! But it&#x27;s a great feeling, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter. I am in my mid-50s and have had hair loss and thinning hair for about 8 years now but this product is making a great difference. I almost never see hair in my comb anymore, or all over the shower floor after I wash my hair. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had good luck with the Ultrax Labs shampoo, and this product holds up to those standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo by itself made my hair thicker, so this adds to the result. My hair wasn&#x27;t oily and it felt thicker right away. It&#x27;s too early to make a claim about the long term results, but things are looking good so far. I also am fond of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came shrink wrapped to a piece of cardboard, like the shampoo. I noticed a lot of complaints about the pump but I didn&#x27;t have much trouble with it. It&#x27;s certainly not the greatest thing in the world, but it works.</li>
    <li> First my wife tried this product. I really love how much more full her hair looks. She jokes with me that I have super thin hair. However, she is right. So, I tried some of this hair serum. We are both happy with how my hair looks. I was surprised at how quickly the product works. We will buy more of this hair product in the the future. My other favorite aspect about the hair serum is the great price!</li>
    <li> It worked! I&#x27;m so glad it did! Couldn&#x27;t have bought a better product :)</li>
    <li> Wow! A little dash of this works wonders. I worked a penny-sized amount of the serum into my hair and instantaneously it felt thicker and looked healthier. You leave it in your hair, so the fact that it smells great and not like chemicals is really helpful. After literally two uses I was getting a few compliments!&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser is super-easy to use and avoids wastage, like I said only a penny sized amount is needed daily. I use the serum in conjunction with the Ultrax Surge shampoo for a winning combo, and would suggest you do as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would not think twice about buying this product; if you have thinning hair you certainly won’t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product!  It is so easy to use and is not noticable when I apply it.  It helped my hair feel thicker and even softer, and my hair was more manageable after using this .  I would recommend this prodcut for anyone that feels like their hair is thinning.</li>
    <li> So after ordering and thoroughly enjoying their shampoo I decided to see if Ultrax offered any additional products. To my pleasant surprise they do. Now the shampoo works great. However you can only use the shampoo while in the shower. I want something in and on my hair all day. This fight is twenty-four seven. That&#x27;s where this product comes in. Just like the shampoo it smells great. It doesn&#x27;t have that sterile, chemical smell. Also it works. My hair is thinning front to back. This stuff makes my hair feel thicker. But it doesn&#x27;t leave an unwanted stickiness. I can rub my fingers through my hair without having to wash them afterwards. I just rub it in and it does it&#x27;s job. All day. If you&#x27;re looking for something to supplement the shampoo or if you just want to use this on your own, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great item with all the unique elements that will definitely make your hair healthier!</li>
    <li> This product burns your scalp gave allergy imediately Amazon please read the fakes review reports about this product I can no believe anybody can benefit of this and the hair surge shampoo front the same vender. This is a Scam do Not Buy it!!!! 0 Star</li>
    <li> Ummm where do I even start? This product is worth your money. I had been searching for other hair products to help with my thinning hair and nothing has helped. I stand by this product and give it my best review I could give it. I have had significant improvement in my hair growth. I have failed miserably with other products but this has been the only one that has worked really well. My hair is so much thicker especially at the front of my head right by the hairline. No more stubborn baby hairs!</li>
    <li> It only lasted for a week. Pretty expensive for a weeks worth of use. It also made my hair look dull.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this hair serum! I just started using it last month and my hair is already so much better. It is way more full and so much thicker. I fee like the volume of my hair has doubled and my hair feels super strong. I love that it is leave in, so convenient. Also, I am noticing new hair growth! That is the most exciting part!</li>
    <li> This product has been really helpful! From an appearance standpoint, I appreciate that applying the product creates an instant visual change.  My hair looks much fuller especially in areas where I have been self conscious. It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy so my hair still has a natural look about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it&#x27;s magic or the caffeine, I&#x27;ve also noticed a reduction in hair loss, which means I&#x27;m sticking with this treatment going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s nice is you can control how much you apply on a daily basis which has helped me get the most out of my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell as well.  Bonus!</li>
    <li> I only like to write reviews for products I personally use and has actually helped me, I use this with some of the other ultrax hair growth products and have seen a huge difference in the appearance of my hair and new growth I&#x27;ve seen over the past 6 months now, this bottle lasted less than a month for me and at ten bucks I think that&#x27;s a pretty good steal, I would like to see this bottle get bigger cause there really isn&#x27;t much but it is worth it for the value, the serum is not greasy and that&#x27;s a bonus! If you&#x27;re looking for the miracle grow product you won&#x27;t find it here but you will find a difference in new hairs and the fullness. I didn&#x27;t see a thousand hairs lol but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that anyways.</li>
    <li> This product works. You will see results within a week. I highly recommend it even though is s little pricey.</li>
    <li> Outstanding Results!!!! Hair lush gave my hair instant Gratification! My hair has more volume than Ever!!! Hair Lush has made a major difference to my hair in just 3 weeks!!!! One word........ Flawlesss!!!!</li>
    <li> The best thing about this product is that you get quick results!! Within a week of beginning to use it, I already started noticing that my hair was becoming thicker and stronger. After a month of use, I noticed a huge difference in the volume of my hair! Another plus is that this shampoo does not cause residual buildup and leave your hair looking greasy, instead it gives your hair a nice healthy shine with added volume. Only about a dime size of this shampoo is needed for each use, so I&#x27;ve noticed that this product lasts a lot longer than other products I have tried in the past. I will be a customer for life!</li>
    <li> Bought this product again for my mom who&#x27;s been trying to find a quality product for her hair loss. Tried this product before through a recommendation and loved the results it produced! Would definitely recommend for those searching for a realistic solution to their hair problems.</li>
    <li> In short, I simply LOVE this product. I know how frustrating it is when you pay a lot of money to buy hair loss treatment products and later they turn out not to be doing their job after use. To write the truth, I was skeptical about Ultrax Labs Hair Lush | Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment Formula Serum in the beginning but decided to give it my last shot. After washing and drying my hair, I gently applied the product both on the hair and scalp while massaging them with my fingers. And guess what? WOW! This product really does work! Based on my two-week-experience, the product thickens your hair and makes it look fuller both instantly and gradually over time. Another thing I love about this product is that it does not make your hair look greasy; not to mention that it has a fresh scent. I will definitely continue using it and would love to share the further results in the near future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the same time as the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Shampoo several weeks ago. I have been scrubbing in the serum after I used the shampoo, and the combination of the two has worked wonders. My hair feels stronger, and no longer breaks like it used to. I can tell my hair is thicker, just like it used to be. I highly recommend getting this for anyone whose hair is thinning. Great Product!</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this item for my husband to use in conjunction with his regular regimen of Ultrax Hair Growth Products. However, within a very short period of time; the results where so great, that I started using it just to see if it could improve my own lifeless hair. It worked! This is by far my new favorite hair must have!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Caffeine Thickening Treatment Formula Serum is a great product that helps you Increase the thickness of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased this product highly recommend and for a first use it smells great and I can fell that my hair very manageable I am expecting a great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Ultrax Labs for this great product and thank you for the fast shipping.</li>
    <li> my hair had always been embarrassingly thin before I started using Ultrax products, i had family members telling me how thin my hair is and how im gonna be bald, I&#x27;M ONLY 22 ! After using this product i could honestly said that my hair has gotten thicker and i have only used it for a few months. It leaves my hair feeling very smooth. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to buy ! If your having problems with thin hair, i recommend to buy this, you wont regret it !</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It makes my hair soft and appear full. From the first use my hair texture has improved! I use almost all their products and they really work.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! Using it with conjunction with the Shampoo has been producing great results!  I was also pleasantly surprised that the aroma was pleasing, and not pungent as some hair products can be. My wife has also commented on her hair feeling more lush, thicker, and healthier.</li>
    <li> The best product I ever used in my hair. The  Ultax labs hair lush does not make hair feel  oily or greasy or oily almost love this product. it  helped  my thin hair  was getting thinner as the days went on .It filled  in my bald spots from loss of hair it made my hair healthy n grow fast. Ive used other  products also  spent a lot of money on them.With Ultra laps hair lush  in just days I see start my hair growing  it wasn&#x27;t even frizzy. Before I started using this product  my hair daily looked like I need a hair cut so bad love this product the best. Never will I stop buying or using this product love it...</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve used different products over the years and this one I like the best. I go with the full treatment using the shampoo, the conditioner, and the Hair Lush after I&#x27;ve stepped out of the shower. It isn&#x27;t messy and is easy to apply. I simply combine it with the gel I use. And, I will continue this routine as I&#x27;ve seen some improvements not only in hair regrowth but in the quality of my hair. I have wavy/slightly curly hair and with daily use the appearance of my hair has brought out the these natural features. I&#x27;m totally satisfied and definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Very good product, it really helps with the scalp more than with making your hair look instantaneously great. With time, the results are great but it is way too expensive. It does not last even 2 weeks... I would love to buy it again, but it is really expensive.If you can afford it, go ahead. The product is very good.</li>
    <li> Scent? Neutral. This product has a light density, and will not weigh the hair down after settling in. This is a fantastic serum for those needing an increase in overall hair strength and thickness. This product does not have that &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; quality some other serums have, which can make hair feel wet or greasy immediately upon use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see any difference in my hair volume, but I&#x27;ve had thinning hair for years so didn&#x27;t expect much. I bought a 2nd one of these because I still have lots of shampoo and scalp conditioner left and want to continue to use the product for awhile longer. It is a nice product for a leave in and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my scalp, that much I will say. I wish it would have done what the description said, but like I said, I didn&#x27;t expect it to do much. And it&#x27;s expensive, to say the least.</li>
    <li> This works right away! After one use my hair is thicker and fuller! This is the best it has ever looked. It is so easy to use. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> Light serum leaves hair feeling soft and healthy. I usually stay away from serums but since my hair has started thinning i decided to try this one... my hair is beginning to grow thicker and fuller. I will be using this again .</li>
    <li> Love Ultrax Labs hair products.  Received this product not too long ago and although it&#x27;s too soon for any hair growth, it does leave my hair nice and thick after I wash it.  Can&#x27;t wait too see more positive outcomes as I continue using it.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect product for any hair thickening needs! It&#x27;s super simple to use, and I can easily fit it into my daily schedule. I usually use it after I take a shower, and I&#x27;ve seen some pretty good improvement. Most other products often turn out gloopy or messy, but this serum has great staying power. In general, it&#x27;s a great investment to make if you&#x27;re looking for a simple solution for hair thinning.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve come across. I&#x27;ve tried everything to help my hair become more healthy and thick. Nothing ever seemed to work for me until now. My hair got way more healthy , people at work even noticed. Less shedding and split ends as well. Five star product. Thanks ! :)</li>
    <li> ultrax has some good products when used with some of their other products. the results are even better give ultrax a try and see for yourself the difference these items will make for you. this product is simple to apply just rub on and done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using ultrax products for a few months now and the results are great. I just got this product about a month ago and it has had great results. After a few uses my hair has appeared thicker. It also doesn&#x27;t leave a gross residue in my hair so it always looks natural and light. If you have thinning hair I would definitely recommend getting this product. You will see results very fast and will be extremely happy with how thick and natural your hair looks.</li>
    <li> This product helped a lot, much less shedding.  Hair seems thicker already.  Must try it.</li>
    <li> Smells great and combined with the shampoo from ultrax labs works wonders.I recommend this product to everyone. My hair has done a complete transformation, looks fuller and so much more healthy.  Also the shipment came days before the estimate date which was a plus.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month now and I will say I have not been disappointed by Ultrax Labs product line. Specifically w/ this serum it has helped me gain much thicker curly hair as well as definitely decreased the amount of shedding after showers or in the mornings after waking up. I will say I do not have thinning or balding hair. I did want a product to give my natural curly hair a thicker healthy coat. I am very satisfied w/ this product and I would definitely recommend it as worth trying!</li>
    <li> This is excellent!  I&#x27;ve been using it almost every day for three months, and I&#x27;m definitely seeing new growth!  Also, this gel is very lightweight and completely non-greasy so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have product in your hair at all.</li>
    <li> Ultrax labs has yet to fail me in their incredible hair growth product line! I have been using all of their products now and have seen incredible results! This one happen to have been my favorite of all products from ultrax and would reccomend this to anyone needing it!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe all the reviews so I wanted to see for myself. I ordered the hair lush based on the description and reputation of Ultrax Labs. And it did not disappoint. I was expecting a strong smell because typically with hair removal, shampoo thickeners and medicated products; theres an overwhelming odor. Not this one. It has no odor at all. NICE!!! PLEASANT&lt;br /&gt;SURPRISE.....anyway I am just getting started with the treatment but so far when I brush less hairs are fallen out, my hair is looking shiny and my edges around hairline appear to be bonding so less scalp sees through. I know I need to use this longer to actually see hair growth but as long as my hair is getting stronger and appears fuller its building my confidence. Thinning hair sucks!!! especially when you are young. So far so good...</li>
    <li> There is a noticeable difference in my hair texture after using this serum. My hair is fuller and thicker.There is a tingling sensation after applying the serum.I feel this is proof my sculp is being massaged for hair growth.  Also my hair is stronger  and softer. Good product.</li>
    <li> There are products that can help thicken hair. I know because I use supplements and a shampoo from this same company. However, generally it takes time. I just started using this product and I&#x27;m flabbergasted by how instantaneous the results are. Much to my chagrin, my hair had always been embarrassingly thin before I started using Ultrax products. After a few months of using their shampoo and supplements, my hair was considerably thicker to the point that I was receiving compliments. In fact, it convinced my friend to try out Hair Lush. It was an immediate success for him and he suggest I try it too. Initially, I was hesitant because I was already quite pleased with the results I was getting using the other products. But at his urging, I gave it a shot. I didn&#x27;t think my hair could get noticeably thicker at this point, but after only a few days of using it, to my amazement, it has! If you have thin hair, don&#x27;t think twice. Get this now! I&#x27;d also recommend using all three products simultaneously. It&#x27;s worked for me. One other piece of advice: you don&#x27;t need a lot of the product with each use. Just a couple of squirts is enough. Any more is wasteful.</li>
    <li> A fan from this particular brand, the hair loss shampoo alone has been working wonders but i wanted to see if this would help with the brittleness of my hair, the shampoo combined with this serum is a great combination. The brittleness of my hair strands are virtually gone,the serum to gave my hair the strength that it once had,my hair grows faster and is filled throughout my scalp something i lost years ago.The Serum leaves no residue or buildup on my scalp which is like the shampoo which i recommend also getting. The Scent is not strong and overbearing nor smelly which to me is a plus,I&#x27;ve been getting more looks and been told I look 5-10 years younger which is a plus and most importantly my hair is healthier than its ever been. Just my experience you may not have the same results.</li>
    <li> From the first time I purchases Ultrax Labs Hair Lush and started using it I saw a major change in my hair. This hair serum is very good it has thicken my hair and it has promoted it to grow. I am on my second bottle and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. This serum is not super oily that makes your hair look dirty it provides a beautiful shine while providing amazing benefits to your hair. I definitely recommend this product to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use in conjunction with the Ultrax Shampoo and Conditioner.  It&#x27;s the cherry on top so to say. I like how it has a slight tingling sensation on the scalp and leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking.  Smells great too.  It&#x27;s great for these winter months when my hair is normally thin, brittle, and breaks easily.  This boosts the volume and shine which helps with the thinning hair issue.  Not only does it boost my hair, but my confidence too!</li>
    <li> A product that actually does what it says it will do?!? That alone makes this product amazing. It makes your hair feel fuller/thicker without weighing it down within the first use. Its a product that you can throw in your hair style and be on your way.  Its very light weight and non greasy making your hair look fuller and gives it great added bounce and movement. It also has the added benefit of repairing damaged hair wether its frizzy, dull, or you have split ends caused from heat and chemicals. It really is an all around great product that does everything you would want a hair product to do. It is well worth it when you think of how much a person spends trying and failing with all of the other products on the market that come up short in their empty promises.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply gel, and I&#x27;m already noticing a difference!!! I do recomend.</li>
    <li> My daily routine includes the shampoo and serum. I don&#x27;t even need to condition anymore because the shampoo already leaves my hair smooth and once I run the serum through my hair with my hands it&#x27;s moisturized, healthier, bouncy, and shiny. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments since I started using these products. I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> I never used a more effective product In my life. My hair feel more fuller and thicker everyday seem like it. No other product made me feel more confident about my hair. I never use to wear my nature hair, but now you would think i have worn it my entire life. This product makes me feel good about myself, because my entire life i searched for a product that gave me so much effectiveness. Now i found it.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first, because I have always had very thin hair and nothing seemed to work.  But this product really works. It makes my hair feel so thick and it makes it hold a style much easier than before.  I love the way my hair feels after using this. Also the product arrive earlier than was predicted, so I didn&#x27;t have to wait long to begin using it.  I have already purchased another bottle for a friend that has thinning hair as well.  This product really works, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Sometimes your hair products needs a total makeover. Using this in combination with the shampoo, there is results that are unmatched with any other hair care products. This product is what makes that wonderful television magic possible at home. The most important thing to taking care of your hair is to treat it just how you would treat any other part of your body. Your hair needs love too. This is the love that your hair needs. It is worth trying out and potentially falling in love with.</li>
    <li> The price tag is high, but this stuff works pretty well. It&#x27;s worth the cost if you want thicker, fuller hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the product description gives more weight to thicker and healthier hair than to hair regrowth, and there is a good reason for that: my hair volume, texture, and appearance improved after the first application, but the regrowth did not start for a month. My hair grows slowly, so the speed of the effect might be different for everyone, but the product does work as described and I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy it again and keep using it to make sure that the improvement continues.</li>
    <li> I have a spot in the back of my head but this thing took care of it quck. People should know about this little bottle</li>
    <li> This product was obtained as a gift for my aunt to use in combination with Ultra Labs Caffeine shampoo. Individually they are both good products, but in combination they have done a remarkable job of halting hair loss and rejuvenating the look, volume and feel of my aunt’s hair. The hairs looks and feels noticeably thicker and stronger. The most surprising thing was the short period of time to see results, we saw benefits within the first week of usage. There have been no adverse reactions or side effects to its use and it has a beautiful aroma. I would definitely recommend purchasing this product, but encourage using them in combination for even faster results.</li>
    <li> After bariatric surgery, I had the side effect of thinning hair and hair loss. Plus a dullness that I hadn&#x27;t had before. This product stopped the hair loss, started regrowing my hair (little baby ones are evident) and my hair is thicker than ever. There is also a shine to it that was never there before. My hair is naturally thin, flat and limp. Like baby hair. Not anymore! It&#x27;s fuller, has the aforementioned growth, and I actually don&#x27;t have to wash it every day like before. The oiliness that&#x27;s bothered me since I was young has drastically been reduced! All around I love this stuff! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I needed a hair product to give me more volume and this item exceeded my expectations. Not only did I achieve the volume I wanted, but my hair feels healthier than ever.  Product was very easy to use due to its pump. Definitely buying again,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started to use it but I love how easily it can be applied to my hair. It&#x27;s not sticky or doesn&#x27;t feel oily and smells good too. I can&#x27;t say the same for other hair thickening products.  I massage it in after my daily shower and day after day I notice my locks becoming a little fuller.</li>
    <li> Yes this is expensive but at least it works. My bottle was completely full unlike others who say they received a half full bottle. I used this in conjunction with the Ultrax Caffeine Shampoo and my hair is a lot more healthy and thick without any oily residue. I have also not experienced any itchiness. I feel like I am pushing back male pattern balding a few years :)</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any result.</li>
    <li> I am witnessing a miracle. I didn&#x27;t want to admit that my hair was thinning but my limp hair and the hairs on the floor and in my brush weren&#x27;t lying. I decided to give this product a go and I am so glad I did. The first time I used it I was in love. I was a bit worried since it was a leave in product but it wasn&#x27;t sticky and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy like many other leave in products have done. That was the first thing I fell in love with. After styling my hair I was even more surprised at how great my hair looked. It actually had body to it and it looked thicker. A huge change from the limp, flat hair that I have had for so long. For me this is worth every cent to get the results that I am getting. I caught myself today thinking I needed to get my hair thinned out a bit at my next hair appointment because my hair is looking so thick. That right there screams volumes to me. (No pun intended :)) I would definitely would call this a miracle product. :)</li>
    <li> A phenomenal product, I&#x27;ve run into some issues with my hair and all I can think is I am too young for this. The Ultrax Labs Hair Lush provides that natural fullness I&#x27;ve been looking for. Product goes on with ease and while it is left in your hair you can instantly feel its lasting effects. If you have been debating which products will give you a balanced look that won&#x27;t disappear look no further, Hair Lush is the right fit.</li>
    <li> This product definitely is worth it! I bought it for my husband and I can see results. He is sooo picky about trying different products but this is one I know he will use because it actually works.</li>
    <li> Initial Review - 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is pretty small. I&#x27;ve had it for exactly 1 months, and only missed about 4 days of application. In that time Ive used about half the bottle, 3 squirts per day. So I expect this whole bottle to last about 2 months. I shower, towel dry, put underwear on, then apply this. I am receding and thinning on the front, so I apply 1 squirt in the middle, and one on each side. I do have thicker hair where I have it, so it absorbs pretty quickly. I will say applying as much as possible may work faster but you&#x27;re gonna need to be rich to afford it. Also, applying mostly to the scalp is a joke, you hair will conveniently soak most of it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I do still notice the tingling on my head for about 5 minutes. I have noticed that the hair is filling in. The small hairs make the hair appear &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; because there is less white and more dark (I have almost black hair). I do honestly believe some of the hair is growing back. I had a couple (like 10) hairs up front and then a patch behind them that was completely bare, and then the rest of my hair. That patch is now filling in with a bunch of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying another bottle based on my current results, and will continue if result continue. Now that I have seen some results, I am worried about burn out. Like, will it fry my hair if I use this continuously for the rest of my life? I have no basis for that, just a fear.</li>
    <li> Much better products out there and much cheaper as well.  This product would be ok for about 6.00 a bottle , but way over priced as an alleged performer worth it&#x27;s price tag.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I&#x27;m amazed by how instantaneous the results are. My hair appears thicker and healthier, and the best part is it has a natural bounce and body to it. I was hesitant because I was already quite pleased with the results I was getting using some of their other products. Thought it will be messy and sticky but this product disproved it. The gel was easy to use and apply. It doesn’t drip from your fingers which is good because it doesn’t get wasted. The product comes in a nice easy to use dispenser, anybody that has thin or fine hair should use this. This &amp;#34;miracle serum&amp;#34; as I like to call it, has a very nice consistency. I am very impressed with this product and will be repurchasing in the near future once I run out.</li>
    <li> Bought a similar product for a female friend who had been experiencing thinning hair during the time we dated, and she insisted on buying this after anecdotal reviews, and later after reading these reviews. She asked me to confirm what she felt was a thickening of her hair, especially in the back of her head. I took the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I thought she may have been jumping on the &amp;#34;bandwagon&amp;#34; to use this product, but either as a result of using it or the combination of it and the other stuff (&amp;#34;Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo,&amp;#34; which I bought her a few months ago), it appears that the thinning patch is &amp;#34;closing&amp;#34; or becoming smaller. I observed my &amp;#34;test subject&amp;#34; apply a very small, concentrated amount to her scalp and take the time to distribute it throughout her scalp, and applying a minute amount to my fingers I noticed a slight tingle, or warming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am an older male who still has a head of hair that would accommodate a dozen people, I can sympathize with men, and even more with women who are suddenly faced with this problem. As with ANY product, try it and make sure its distributor guarantees it, and in the case of Hair Lush - watch and keep track of the results!</li>
    <li> I always buy Hair lush after winter ends to fix the damage from cold weather, and from wearing hats and scarves daily. My hair is very long, so it cant just get healthy on its own, it needs an extra boost, and this product is just what I need! I tried many olives for hair, and reconstructing butter from various brands, and silicone based products, nothing helped to renew strength and healthy look of my hair, so visible as Hair Lush did. I like that this hair product doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy, it&#x27;s not sticky during the use, it simply makes the hair thicker, and shinier.</li>
    <li> Believe what the product says it does because this actually works. It&#x27;s amazing to me because the thickness of my hair is something that I&#x27;ve always been big on. Ive found that many products seem as though just sit on top of your head, without doing anything. It&#x27;s refreshing to actually see results. Once you get your bottle you may be thrown off by how small it is, but trust when I say a little goes a long way. You&#x27;ll notice a change in thickness no later than 3 weeks. Another great thing I noticed is how it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with that disgusting unnatural streaky feeling that other products seem to do. I absolutely hate that, and it&#x27;s something that ive notice is very common with hair growth products. You get what you pay for and I&#x27;m excited about seeing my results within the next six months!</li>
    <li> I love this product and the results I have seen so far. My hair is manageable and it smells great, which is a plus! Staple product for me!</li>
    <li> I am 43 years old and have a thinning hair problem.I started using hair lush on my bald spot and started to see some results! I know it will take some time, but so far so good after just a week!</li>
    <li> I have used it off and on for the last couple of weeks.  I purchased this along with the hair surge shampoo out of desperation because of recent hair loss from hypothyroidism (diagnosed 3 weeks ago).&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely happy the first few times I used hair lush, however, it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well the following week.  I do not think it is worth $50.... I think it is way over priced.  It says on the container to use generously.... Honestly, if I did that, it would&#x27;ve been gone in less than 2 weeks.  I have been purchasing lots of other hair products in the last couple of weeks for my thin hair and absolutely love clairol &amp;#34;hair food&amp;#34; hair thickener.  It seems to have the same effect as hair lush but maybe better, because I don&#x27;t mind using the clairol more generously! Just bought it at target on sale for $10.  I would only repurchase hair lush if they drastically dropped the price!</li>
    <li> It smells horrible and made me sick.</li>
    <li> Certainly provides cosmetic thickness…..extremely expensive though; the German product Alpecin Caffeine Liquid Hair Energizer, sold on UK Amazon, has exactly same effect on hair follicles - it costs £7.49 for 200ml opposed to Lush&#x27;s £32 for 50ml.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent leave-in treatment for your hair. The best thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling oily/greasy. Results are noticeable within days of starting this. It&#x27;s great used in conjunction with Ultrax shampoo for thickening. Definitely worthwhile for thinning hair and noticeable areas of hair loss. Make sure to follow the instructions too!</li>
    <li> After using Hair Lush for about a week and a half, my only question was -where has it been hiding all this time??  The results were  unbelievable in such a short time. AMAZING!! I have been using it for 4+ months now - and happy to announce that by Christmas,  it seems like my hair will be beyond where I neee it to be. Thinning hair be gone for good. Not only is my hair thicker, it is heathier and now has a spanking new bounce to it! I no longer have to install extensions within my natral hair in order to have a fuller look. I have much fuller hair all natrally now... and keeps getting better #WOW. You only need to use a small amount each time so the bottle will definitely last a long time - so its well worth the money. And its not expensive at all. It took away the frizziness and the dryness from my hair the very first time I used it. The best part about Hair Lush is that is non-greasy and has a nice light pleasant smell to it. You dont have to worry about messy up your pillows of bed linen at nights, which is a plus. I used to bleach my hair a long time ago and this product right here is helping with getting my hair back where I need it to be. I recommend Hair Lush to anyone going back and forth about  which product to try - get it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! A great  bargain! Unique item that you just cannot get anywhere else!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! :) This whole line smells amazing and the serum makes my hair so much fuller! I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times and can already tell a huge difference. Noticeably less breakage &amp; my hair is much healthier. I&#x27;ve always had thin hair and this is the only product that works and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Ultrax products are all great formulas so you only have to use a small amount each time. Well worth the money. I would recommend to anyone who has thin hair!!!</li>
    <li> Ive always had trouble with my hair being to thin. Not any more. I can honestly say this product changed me. My hair looks so much healthier. It&#x27;s shining and feels lovely. People are noticing and I feel better about my self. I recommend big time!</li>
    <li> Initially skeptical when I saw how tiny the container was, but I am pleasantly surprised, just a few days into using it, at the results. Noticeably thicker, and healthy looking with just a small amount applied. Consider me a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> After my first use I was getting compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair looks! My hair is softer and has more bounce and body. The serum comes in a small bottle but it is concentrated, so I use two squirts and rub it between my finger tips then massage it into my roots. I can feel my scalp get a little tingly so I know if I have missed any spots, then I just style and usual. It has a pleasant salon smell and a nice texture (not sticky, or crispy after bow dry). I also use their shampoo and I have noticed the brassiness of my blonde hair is going away too, so my naturally blonde hair looks highlighted! If you have dull thin hair I recomend this company and their products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really pleased with the Ultrax Labs line of caffeine stimulating products, and this treatment falls right in line.  I&#x27;m on my first bottle and my hair has been so fluffy and bouncy.  I also have been using the UL Hair Surge shampoo and then I apply this treatment when my hair is still wet only to my scalp.  I let it air dry for about 15 minutes and then blow dry my hair and it looks like a million bucks! You can&#x27;t even tell you have product in your hair because it&#x27;s really light and not greasy.  Even my husband, just tonight asked me, &amp;#34;did you just take a shower?&amp;#34; I said &amp;#34;this morning,&amp;#34;  he said &amp;#34;cause your hair looks really pretty today.&amp;#34;  Even he noticed that my hair looks better!  I know UL products are expensive, but I believe they are worth it.  Since using, my hair is less greasy, shinier, thicker, and just prettier!  This product, like the shampoo, contains peppermint oil and menthol.  This will make your scalp tingle.  It also will make your hands tingle from the peppermint so be sure to wash your hands after use.  It will make anything you touch on your body tingle!  Don&#x27;t rub your eyes!  Wash hands before.  I am slightly sensitive to peppermint though!  Use this with the Hair Surge shampoo.  You will not regret it.  I am prone to having greasy hair, and this stuff almost counteracts oil.  I really love that!</li>
    <li> This hair growth serum by Ultrax labs is definitely one of the best hair growth serum currently in market.I use&lt;br /&gt;their hair growth shampoo and this hair growth serum concurrently.I have constantly had issues with hair fall / hair thinning and have tried multiple products over time to treat my condition.This hair serum has ingredients like caffeine,biotin and keratin&lt;br /&gt;all of which contribute for a healthy and lustrous hair.I use this serum regularly after my hair wash with hair growth shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Consistent use of these products have definitely helped me since I now have a thick,healthy and lustrous hair.This hair serum&lt;br /&gt;forms a protective layer on the hair strands and protects hair from all kinds of damage and also stops it from tangling.I definitely&lt;br /&gt;recommend this hair serum by Ultrax labs who are currently the best brand for complete hair care solutions.</li>
    <li> This product is a great leave-in option for fighting hair loss or thinning. It&#x27;s as simple as massaging into the scalp once or twice a day, and the active caffeine ingredient goes to work strengthening hair roots. My results have been universally positive so far, and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an easy way to thicken existing hair, and to promote new hair growth. It also smells really good, and comes in a really slick bottle!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with the Ultrax Shampoo. I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my scalp like a lot of products. It is lightweight, doesn&#x27;t drip, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. My hair is thicker and not oily or greasy. I wash my hair with the Ultrax Shampoo, put the serum on the roots, and then blow dry my hair. My hair feels great when I brush it. I don&#x27;t worry about hair fall out with the use of these products. My hair feels and looks strong, full, and healthy!</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t believe how quick this works.  I put it on while my hair is still slightly damp, and it gives my roots volume after it tries.  I love my hair now!</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair is thicker and stronger than before.</li>
    <li> Wow this product from Ultrax Labs is so amazing!  Hair Lush is the best  hair serum I have ever used!  My hair has been thinning so much at a tremendous speed and when I started using this I could see RESULTS within the first two weeks.  My hair is shinier, healthy and FULL! I use this with the Ultrax Shampoo and the combination works wonders.  It smells really nice and a little goes a long way so you save money!  All around a great investment and I recommend using this over any other hair treatment for thinning hair.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> Save my hair and me from having to go bald. One of the best hair loss products out there!</li>
    <li> I just start using this product as of 10/2/2014, i bought it because i have thinning hair, i will update my review after i finish first bottle.</li>
    <li> This serum fantastic! My hair is much thicker and fuller after using it. It doesn&#x27;t leave you hair sticky or stiff either. I am so happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been so impressed with this entire line of products. After just two months of use I&#x27;ve seen a significant change in the thickness and shine of my hair. After years of disappointment with other products I&#x27;ve been so happy to find this line. I look forward to see where my hair could go from here. Being able to style and brush my hair without fear of fallout or disappointment in how it looked this has TRUELY changed how I feel about myself. I had thinning areas near the front of my hair (around my face) and anytime j wore my hair back in the pony tail I was always self conscious. Now I&#x27;ve seen a real difference and feeling more confident!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s amazing how so little work can lead to great results. The tingly feeling that it leaves is so refreshing, plus you know it&#x27;s working. Thicker, fuller hair is right around the corner. I feel like each actual strand of hair has gotten thicker from using this.</li>
    <li> A fantastic product that offers noticeable and very rapid results. The Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Caffeine Thickening Treatment Formula Serum contains high quality ingredients and utilizes their unique state of the art caffeine formula to create a extremely effective leave in hair thickening and growth promoting serum that produces Noticeable results in a short amount of time. It is easy and convenient to use any time and also has a very pleasant scent and a light feel. An overall great product that produces fast results and does what it says it will.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a while now and i love it, real simple to apply, just squirt a little in your hands and rub through your hair, defiantly helped the strength of my hair!</li>
    <li> Different texture in my hair, had a hard time finding a product that worked. Simply love it!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thicker and longer. I defiantly recommend this product and the rest of the ultrax labs hair treatment products to any one who needs a little help growing their hair. Use this product with the ultrax shampoo and conditioner, be patient and watch out for results.</li>
    <li> I use this to compliment the caffeine shampoo I started using a couple months ago. Not only does it give your hair a healthy look but it gives it bounce and a luster like no other. It help to rebuild hair damaged by harsh hair products and incorrect hair hygiene. I like it because it&#x27;s light weight and you can use it along with your normal hair products. I do suggest you buy the caffeine shampoo for added benefits. Great for all hair types and works phenomenally hands down.</li>
    <li> I had been losing my hair for years. Nothing help and I tried so many different products. When I came across The Ultrax Labs brand, I couldn&#x27;t have been happier. When I say you see the results fast I don&#x27;t lie. My hair has thickened so much in the last 3 months and I dont know what I would do without this product. If you have thin hair, don&#x27;t think twice. Get this product now! I honestly can&#x27;t live without it. This product alone has left me flabbergasted! Everyone I know I tell to get it, even if they don&#x27;t have thin hair. I swear to them as I do to you, even if you want your hair thicker and by thicker I mean to the point which the thickness is shown in each and every strand. I also recommend not only using this product but all the products by them. I am currently using the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampo, Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement, and now this one. Honestly You can use these products on there own, or you can use them together. Of course I&#x27;ve been feeling that using the products together it has increased everything by 10 times.</li>
    <li> after 3 weeks I don&#x27;t see any changes in my hair.  I&#x27;ll give it another 3 weeks to decide.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I have seen significant improvement both in the thickness and amount of hair restored. As with any remedy you have to be diligent, and avoid bad hair care habits. There are a few negative reviews I see, I guess as with anything some things work for one person and not for another.... But this serum brought my thinning hair back from the dead I used it daily massaging it into my scalp for a few minutes just to get my blood circulating, and over the course of a few weeks I noticed a huge difference.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, so easy to apply, feels great on my hair, and provides fuller hair instantly. If you want your thinning hair to look and feel healthier and thicker, this is the product to use. Since The scent smells really fresh and light, unlike other products that can give off a stronger scent almost smelling cheap cologne</li>
    <li> A great compliment to the shampoo. I definitely notice the tingling on my scalp and the that my hair seems fuller. If you&#x27;ve ever had fine or thinning hair, you know that few and far between are the products that actually work.</li>
    <li> Okay, I am hooked on Ultrax Labs products! Have been using a couple in combination and I love the way it leaves my hair feeling, thicker, fuller and stronger! I am getting absolute results! Would recommend for anyone with thinning hair or even if you just want thicker lush looking hair!</li>
    <li> This product is beyond amazing, I have purchased Ultrax Labs products before and they consistently impress me. I have a history of hair thinning on my fathers side of my family and this product has made that a thing of the past. My daily morning cycle consists of: Washing my hair with the Ultrax Shampoo and then rubbing this serum into my scalp before I start my day. If you&#x27;re looking for real results, this product is the way to go.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing hair serum by Ultrax Labs. Within weeks I experienced noticeable results. I was receiving compliments from so many mentioning how thick and lush my hair looked. Even my more stronger strands of hair looked healthier. With the growth and volume I&#x27;ve gained I have noticed far less hair breakage when brushing. This hair serum is a better alternative to many pills and medicines used for hair growth. When I run out, I will be sure to purchase again!</li>
    <li> First I want to say that for a treatment product, this smells surprisingly normal. Some of the stuff I have tried has a harsh odor, but this actually smells mostly like normal hair product, which is a welcomed surprise. As for effectiveness, it feels like it is working so far. I haven’t had it very long so I can’t comment on long term results, but it certainly feels like something is happening on my head. I have no doubts that the serum is stimulating my scalp. Hopefully I will see further results in the coming weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I have African American hair and it really moistures it.  It is a great leave in, touch up.  I really like the soft fragrant smell.  The serum is very light and effective for styling especially to tie your hair back. You only need 2-3 pumps of product per area.  and it glides in, without a sticky greasy feeling as other products. My hair was ruined from wearing lace front wigs and its already starting to grow back.</li>
    <li> I tried this product with the growth stimulating shampoo and I am very pleased!  A tingling feeling when applied to hair.  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for stronger thicker hair.</li>
    <li> After using this thickening serum, I noticed a great improvement in the appearance of my hair. My hair is not only thicker but much healthier than before use of this product. The leave in caffeine prevents further hair loss and stimulates hair growth. Try this product! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Yet another good product from Ultra Labs. I use this in conjunction with the caffeine shampoo and the supplements and it&#x27;s worked well for me. My hair is thicker, looks fuller and feels soft. You only need a small amount so, a little goes a long way. I will definitely get more once this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It&#x27;s easy to apply, feels great on my hair, and provides fuller hair instantly. If you want your thinning hair to look and feel healthier and thicker, this is the product to use. Since I started using this, I can wear my hair in styles now that it used to be too thin for. It has a light fresh scent. I&#x27;ll be buying more when I finish this bottle.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! You can apply it on wet or dry hair and it still works!</li>
    <li> Great product it helped me with my hair loss and the growth where it was loss.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product to help with fine limp hair. I used to have thick hair but due to color, blow drying and other harsh chemicals and aging I&#x27;ve noticed my hair becoming thinner and dry. I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out and trying to feed it the right products. I noticed ever since I started using Ultrax Caffeine Formula Serum that my hair is more manageable and fuller.  I love how it doesn&#x27;t take that much serum to notice what a beautiful difference it has made compared to other serums that I have used. Others left an over oily feeling and made my hair limp.  Curls last longer and my ends are are no longer frizzy rather they are shinier and healthier looking with lots of volume and bounce.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little while now. I am in love with the whole line Ultrax Labs hair care line! Honestly having such thin hair I have tried so many different products, until I came across this brand. I couldnt ask for a better make, or even faster shipping. Just this product alone I have seen a big difference in my hair, my hair is no longer thin and breaking, its grown so fast and so strong and feels like silk. Never have I ever been happier with a product or company. Also I must say a little does go a long way with this stuff. I only use a drop at a time and I can cover everything. I cant wait this this bottle to arrive, I only have a tad bit left in the bottle i have now. I would recommend this product to anyone with thin hair, or thinning hair, or even anyone that wants there hair thicker and shinier.</li>
    <li> Hair Lush works wonders! I squirt a little on my hands and rub the product onto my scalp right after my showers. When I first started using this product, I noticed a difference in the thickness of my hair almost instantaneously! Within a few uses, my friends and family kept telling me how great my hair looked-- which, let me tell you, that was never something anyone has said to be in recent years due to my evident thinning. I am now super confident in how I look, because I am no longer self-conscious of the appearance of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have not been using this product for long and I am truly amazed at how much healthier and thicker my hair looks.It smells great and is very lightweight and easy to apply.I like that it is non greasy and does not weigh my hair down like other products do.I am getting so many compliments on how beautiful and full of volume my hair is and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.I am very happy to have found  Hair Lush and Ultrax Labs hair products they have given me back my confidence.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The instant thickening serum seems to really work! You will feel a tingle when applying - just a couple of squirts works well. This thickening treatment worked wonders for me - would recommend!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to both men and women regardless of hair loss.  It smells great and my hair is extremely manageable every time I use this product..  It not only counteracts hair loss/damage that you may have incurred over the years, it gives me an added boost of energy because of the caffiene.  This is a very innovative and cutting edge product that I will continue to use.  Ultrax Labs will continue to do great things in the world of hair restoration.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> I have gone through numerous products to help thicken my hair and give me more volume and it&#x27;s been such a frustrating experience - until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously this stuff is magic. I&#x27;ve been dealing with some minor hair loss recently and this stuff has not only helped fix that situation, but it&#x27;s given me such a boost in confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend Hair Lush to anyone who has tried other products that haven&#x27;t worked, or to anyone who wants to cut out all of the extra work. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect companion to the Ultrax Shampoo and Conditioner, this finishing serum is the one. Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment Serum is light and easy to use. I use my fingers to rub a small amount of the serum through my hair, and it seems to refresh and rejuvenate new life to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks and feels thicker. I love how it feels, how it looks and most of all how fast it&#x27;s growing.</li>
    <li> This product is good but to expensive, and the bottle its almost empty.</li>
    <li> For the size if the product it is amazing. You only need a small amount and it does a great job not only thickening your hair but bringing life back to dull flat hair. In just a few days my hair was shinny and bouncy again and then a few weeks later it began to thicken. I am beyond happy with the product. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great hair thickener that makes your hair look and feel thicker instantly. Product smells really good.    Not sure about long term effects yet or hair regrowth so I will update the review after a few months.</li>

    <li> Think of it as a long lasting hair gel. Thats all I got out of it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;m super excited about my new growth and my hair fuller since I began using the serum.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Ultrax shampoo and decided to see if the thickening treatment would work as well. I was blown away! In addition to Instantly thickening my hair within a few days my hair was also longer. Just like the shampoo, this product contains caffeine to stimulate hair growth, making the product is 100% natural. I love the smell and how effective the product is. It also last a very long time, since a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> - Love This Product ! Faster Growth , &amp; Nomote Lost Hair !</li>
    <li> Since using Ultrax Hair Lush serum my hair has gotten thicker and not only that my hair is more dense. I feel like my hair looks like it has grown stonger and healthier than before my hair loss. I would reccommend this product strongly.</li>
    <li> Have used this product a few times and I&#x27;m really shocked at how my hair appears thicker and healthier SO QUICKLY! It is great as it does not leave a film nor does it make my hair sticky or stiff like some products that I have tried…which is a huge deal!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak for all, but this product really seems to work for my thinning hair issues. Definitely worth a try!!</li>
    <li> Used the hair lush in the past and it truly does that job. Look for results fast. I over expected the results I got from first time used and currently. Recommended to all looking for a top product</li>
    <li> this serum is amazing. i love how it feels on my hair and the tingling sensation is a plus.it doesnt take long for you to see results.one maybe two uses and i saw a change in my hair.it was fuller and thicker i would be ordering this again</li>
    <li> You can really feel and see the difference after using this, my hair is thicker and healthier than ever. other people notice it too!!</li>
    <li> After dealing with thinning hair issues for quite some time, I finally bit the bullet and purchased this product, and I must say, it is excellent! I was blown away by how quickly I noticed change, which has immediately left me with fuller, thicker hair. I recommend Hair Lush to everyone who is looking to revamp their look!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs’ Hair Lush is unlike any other leave in treatment I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment I first applied it to my hair I was hooked. Immediately I could&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feel Hair Lush going to work as its caffeine sent a tingling sensation to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s like a daily wake up call for my hair. In the week that I have been using this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;product my hair has gotten stronger, softer and fuller. Other leave in treatments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have left my hair heavy and oily. Hair Lush manages to strengthen hair without all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the weight. A perfect combo indeed!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT LEAVES MY HAIR FEELING FULLER AND HEALTHIER AND SUPER BOUNCY AND FULL OF BODY. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE LOOKING TO GET THE LIFE BACK INTO THEIR HAIR</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist as well as a licensed high school teacher so I feel I know what to expect from a product and how to read and follow instructions. There is no way that this small bottle can be used per the directions and last more than a week if you apply to a full head. I&#x27;ve used it on the very front portion of my scalp where I&#x27;ve experienced some thinning and see absolutely no results. The reviewers who claim to see benefits beyond scalp regrowth must have acquired some giant sized version of the product if they can apply it to their whole head as well as the ends of their hair! I would have to see before and after photos, verified by an independent licensed cosmetologist before I would consider the positive claims to have some validity. Mea culpa of not reading the complete reviews before purchasing. I should know better but as my grandmother said &amp;#34;we live in hope and die in dispair&amp;#34;! I was hoping that I would at least see some improvement even if not the magic elixir of restoring hair. Back to Keranique for me as it does leave my hair feeling healthy and with more volume.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I must say I am impressed by the results I&#x27;m receiving. Hair Lush is a must try!</li>
    <li> My wife has always had low self esteem due to her hair being very thin, thanks genetics! When i bought this product i figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try.  Sure enough she&#x27;s got great hair with no scalp showing,  over all she feels so beautiful!  We couldn&#x27;t be more grateful for such an amazing product</li>
    <li> Being wary of hair thickening products because of past experiences, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d be satisfied with Ultrax Labs Hair Lush but to my surprise I have seen great results! It has thickened my hair and added a noticeable bounce as well! Looks and feels great! At this price point I&#x27;d definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have been using this product religiously for months. I have always had very thin fine hair, this helps me keep and grow more of it. It&#x27;s a nice addition to biotin or prenatal vitamins!!</li>
    <li> Such an easy-to-use product that you simply have to put in your hands and run through your hair. It&#x27;s great to use after showers and leaves hair feeling full and soft. The formula comes out in a simple pump and doesn&#x27;t require much effort.</li>
    <li> This is a product that has changed my hair with just a few uses. I was so concerned with how my hair was beginning to look. It was getting way too thin and I needed to get something that would help change this process quickly. This product was the perfect solution. I will continue to use and definitely recommend it to others if you&#x27;re feeling insecure about your hair like I was.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product! It is not sticky or heavy, and leaves my hair not only feeling thicker, but looking great. The light scent is nice, and it feels good on my scalp. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> So glad I found this online.  This stuff works so good.  My hair is thicker and stronger after using this product.  Results are not instant but after a few uses not a few bottles!  Really great stuff!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  I recently bought the shampoo from Ultrax and after leaving a review I discovered this serum.  What a find!  This works great with adding body and shine to my hair after using Ultrax&#x27;s shampoo.  These products have done wonders to my hair while not only thickening my hair but also making it much more healthy.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best thickening treatment I have used, and I have used quite a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect thicker and stronger hair than you already have.</li>
    <li> This product has better expectations than I honestly thought. Will definetly purchase often.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well! I&#x27;m using it everyday and seeing great results. I recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I am 25 and I was definitely going bald and the hairs I had we&#x27;re thinning I tryed to hide it by wearing hats but after a while I had to do something about it and my brother told me about something that would really improve my hairs thickness and  growth so I went and picked it up and skeptical of coarse but I tried it and in acouple of weeks I started to notice less balding and it was thickening my hair I was very surprised and happy at the same time now that I am three months into it the product my hair is growing quite rapidly and soon there will be no signs of balding so if I were you I would definitely use this product it help me look and feel younger and give me the confidence I need when in public</li>
    <li> My hair is thicker and fuller since I began to use this product. Saw results after just a couple of uses! The foam is light and does not leave residue! Plus super fast shipping! Definitely will purchase again and again! A++!!!</li>
    <li> No amount of money is too much money to feel confident and attractive. Unfortunately all too often that feeling goes away when we don&#x27;t feel physically perfect, even when it comes to something as basic as hair. So, if you feel like your hair needs to be thicker or longer, use this liberally. My own situation is from gastric bypass surgery affecting the different phases of my hair growth, creating some embarrassing situations but there&#x27;s a three-product system from the same maker going on here, so it&#x27;s best to use all three together.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased the product, I did not expect much since the product is a bit smaller then expected. However, it is so concentrated that you only need a small amount. Within a week of daily using, my hair had a natural healthy shine and within a month, my hair was thicker and fuller then ever before. My split ends were also mending themselves, and my hair was bouncy and full. I was very impressed with this product and will be repurchasing in the near future once I run out.</li>
    <li> My husband tried this along with the shampoo and has seen a real difference.  His hair is thicker and he has some re-growth where there was just a bald spot.  You only need a small amount and it smells great!  I tried some as I have thin hair and really liked the shampoo and it just made my hair feel thicker.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Its hard to find anything online with 5 star rating and the Ultrax Labs Hair Lush is worth 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt; Do to the fact that i am so impatient this product works for me it gives me instant thickness to my hair as well as it promotes healthy hair growth. when using this product please follow the instructions after all you want to make sure you are using this product the right way to ensure you get the right results.</li>
    <li> Perfect compliment to an awesome product (the shampoo)! I have been using the shampoo for some time now and I&#x27;m completely satisfied. SO, I was thrilled when I came across their leave in treatment. What better way to continue my treatment then with a leave-in treatment that will continue to work on my hair re-growth throughout the day. Just like with the shampoo, I enjoy the scent and since it&#x27;s s serum, I no longer have the need to add additional products to my hair. This product is a winner in my book!</li>
    <li> This product is great and you can definitely notice a difference after just a few uses. My natural hair is very thin, straight and limp. After using this, my hair feels thicker and stronger. Followed the other users&#x27; advice and just used a little bit at a time. Glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I really wish I would have started using this stuff years ago.  I&#x27;ve tried a few products here and there over the last five years since I started to notice thinning on the top part of my head.  Usually I buy a product (I&#x27;ve tried some shampoos, pills, etc.) and go through a whole bottle or two without noticing any change. With Hair Lush, I started to notice the results within the first week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately noticed my hair feeling smoother and looking shinier after a few days.  At around two weeks, I started to feel tiny hairs poking up in my thinning areas.  After a month, I can feel and see fuller, thicker hair on the top of my head.  When I wash my hair in the shower, it feels so much fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a job where I have to look good so this product has been a god send!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an extremely happy camper and will continue to purchase this as long as Ultrax keeps selling it!</li>
    <li> I can recommend this product with 100 % certainty . In my personal experience I have seen the changes so fast ,  I have been consistent in using this product every day.  Make sure to follow the instructions and massage the product. You only need try. You going to make it change in your hair.</li>
    <li> I must start off by saying, &amp;#34;where have you been all my life?&amp;#34; Well, maybe not &#x27;all my life&#x27; but more so all of my hair thinning days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent plenty of money on shampoos, hair treatments; you name it, I bought it, to repair my hair. I&#x27;ve read review after review and finally, I bumped into a lady at the hair salon who&#x27;d had a story similar to mine. She told me about Hair Lush and how it worked wonders for her.  I ordered it, immediately, using my iPhone and couldn&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, for me, the lady&#x27;s advice at the salon that day was ON POINT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a significant increase in thickness and my hair no longer looks ragged and rough like it used to. I also love the fact that the product seems weightless.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, like some other products, and there is minimum build up. I placed an order for 2 more bottles; one for my travel bag and a &#x27;reserve&#x27; bottle to have on hand when I get low. LOL - I don&#x27;t want to live without my Hair Lush.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m not usually a person to care if a product isn&#x27;t filled to the top, but this was pretty much filled up halfway. For the price that is ridiculous! The bottle itself is actually really small, about the size of a travel sized toothpaste. It&#x27;s also filled with bubbles, so that is even worst. So I honestly did not use this product much, since I was in panic mode and started using a lot of things. So I can&#x27;t tell you if it works for hair loss or growth. However, I can tell you this thing smells AWESOME! I just started to use it since the hairless product I do use leaves my hair pretty dead looking. The only reason I gave it a 3 is because I do like the smell, and I haven&#x27;t used it long term like I said before. For the price and amount you get, you might be better off looking for something else. It won&#x27;t last more than a month at best. If the bottle was bigger and full with a big price drop. I would use this everyday.</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for me. I usually don&#x27;t try anything like this, it just seemed too good to be true. I took the chance and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results so far. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more it can do for my hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 26. But still, my hair has been getting a little thin on top these last few years. My boss, who is in his late 40&#x27;s with a great head of hair, told me about Ultrax Labs Hair Lush, so I decided I&#x27;d see if what worked for him works for me. It does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I began taking it, my hair has been thicker, bouncier, and even shinier than it was when I was a teenager. I noticed that my last few bottles had run out faster than normal. When I told my girlfriend about this, she informed me that she&#x27;d started using it too (not that she is bald, she just wants her hair to have more body). We&#x27;re buying two bottles for the next order so that she can stop taking mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with pharmaceuticals that will hurt your libido, or Rogaine that will make your whole scalp all sticky. Just order this. Admittedly, this is a little pricey, but if you compare it to a hair transplant, it is a no brainer.</li>
    <li> In only a short time of using this product, the results are amazing! This works better than any other product on the market. I will be recommending this to anyone who needs a product like this one. In just a few uses, you will see dramatic changes.</li>
    <li> This serum is serious amazing, it makes my hair look and feel thicker. The awesome thing is that it doesn&#x27;t feel nasty, your hair feels amazing. This serum is really a must for anyone that wants bigger fuller hair with amazing texture.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first, however, I must say I was quite surprised. This has definitely thickened my hair over time. My hair was thinning due to a couple of issues, however this has definitely helped so much!! Will continue using.</li>
    <li> Found out right after ordering that my hair loss was due to skin lupus &amp; this would not help.  Returned.</li>
    <li> I really like the product and it seemed to be working, but the bottles itself are cheap and the pumps stopped working for me on my first bottle half- empty , I wrote to the company for a refund or replacement bottle and they never respond. I ordered another one , because I liked the product, I used it for a few days and today the pumps again gave me a hard time.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been dealing with thinning hair for a long time. I&#x27;ve always had thin hair. Since using this product I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on my hair. I&#x27;ve come to see that all the Ultrax Labs products are a must have because they actually work. I give this 5 stars all the way. My hair is healthy, thicker, fuller so beautiful. I love it and you will too!</li>
    <li> I never thought the day would come where my thin lifeless hair would have and develop a natural body to it, my hair is getting thicker because of Ultrax labs hair lush thickening treatment, I love that I can leave this product in my hair &amp; watch it go to work. Since it contains biotin &amp; caffeine my hair &amp; scalp is loving all these beneficial ingredients. No more weak brittle strands, time to show off my hair like a  model without worrying about it splitting, shedding &amp; breaking all over the place from the wind.</li>
    <li> My hair is getting thicker each time I use this product. It&#x27;s truly amazing how it&#x27;s helped stop my hair from falling out. I would recommend this to anyone having issues with their hair falling out.</li>
    <li> My Father has been pleased with the other Ultrax Labs products he&#x27;s been using, like the Hair Maxx keratin supplement and the Hair Surge caffeine shampoo, so we decided to try this Hair Lush as it is a leave-in conditioner product rather than shampoo or oral supplement, and promises other benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far with the shampoo, keratin supplement and now this, my Father&#x27;s hair is looking years younger than it did just a couple months ago. While the shampoo and keratin supplement were noticeably stimulating growth and bringing the dark color back in on the roots, this leave-in thickener is definitely &amp;#34;repairing&amp;#34; his hair by bringing it back to the thicker, more full volume that it once was. His hair just seems so much healthier. This is probably due to the keratin and biotin that is in Hair Lush in addition to the caffeine.</li>
    <li> Love it it is an amazing product</li>
    <li> Started seeing some thinning up front. Read great reviews on this so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle now and do not see a difference. I guess it time to keep looking for a better solution.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs is becoming my favorite hair care line. This serum pumps up the volume of my hair at the roots and it lasts all day long! I love this product!</li>
    <li> I have hair loss from stress sometimes and this product did amazing job on stopping it. So far it took only 5 days to work. I&#x27;ll see how its going to be in the future.</li>
    <li> I used this with the Ultrax hair growth shampoo and they work great together! As mentioned in my review for that shampoo, my hair feels fuller and thicker, I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great finishing touch to the shampoo and conditioner. The serum is not greasy or oily and like the shampoo and conditioner it smells really good. After massaging this serum into your scalp your hair is manageable when styling and it leaves hair looking fuller and healthier.</li>
    <li> Since starting this product, my hair has become more full. I was getting desperate and really wanted something that would help my thin hair regain some thickness. I have tried product after product and found I was simply throwing my money out the window, so it was a breath of fresh air to finally find one that works.</li>
    <li> once again the price is a little to steep, so i shopped around here in Philly and found this product for a cheaper price(about 4.99 lower)and i am ok with that because once again ultra labs have proven themselves to be a very reliable hair care line.this pro duct reminds me of a what a very high end salon would use on your hair,once again very impressed</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I was using another product I found on Amazon, which I found to be effective, but that product made my hair revert from &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34; to its natural kinky state, so I thought I would give this a try.  This product brought amazing results super fast, within two weeks (I also started using the Ultrax shampoo and I take a Biotin supplement).  My hair retained its relaxed state after use.  I have seen lots of new growth around my hairline, that I lost after childbirth.  I will purchase more to be sure I do not run out.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> For someone like me who has severely damaged hair this is the perfect addition to the Ultrax shampoo and conditioner. I already love how the shampoo and conditioner make my hair look and feel. This leave in treatment gives my hair that added help it desperately needs. I love knowing that this product line will help me have the beautiful hair I envy seeing on other women. The best part of using this leave in treatment is that you can use it on wet or dry hair. Those options make it easier when you&#x27;re in a rush and don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair because all you have to do is massage this into your scalp and you can feel it working it&#x27;s way from root to tip.</li>
    <li> Great product  for thinning hair and hair loss.  The caffeine will help to stimulate the hair follicles and also get the hair to grow. Great Job Thanks</li>
    <li> The product smells really nice. I have been using it for a long time, everytime I have a shower and since a few months ago, my hair grows up stronger, more powerful. My hair loss has been reduced significantly and you can stretch it not fearing about removing it from your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A perfect product, even more combined with other Ultrax Labs products I use. Also the price is quite competitive now. Worths it!</li>
    <li> My name is Lisa Rosario I tried Ultrax Labs Hair Lush it really made my her full of shine and more manageable, excellent I rate it with five stars</li>
    <li> Great product! This item works really well and makes your hair look younger and healthier!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It leaves my hair feeling very soft and smells soo good! The consistency of the product is nice, it&#x27;s not too sticky like other products. I notice my hair has more volume and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it. I think the positive reviews on here are fake because this product is no less than a scam. I wish there was a zero rating because I wouldn&#x27;t give a one star. I work hard for my money and couldn&#x27;t really afford to even buy this but out of desperation and reading the positive reviews gave it a try. TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.</li>
    <li> WHAT  a WASTE of MONEY!!! DO NOT fall for this FAKE product!!! It only dries your hair. Believe me if you want to throw away your money, buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with thinning hair for nearly a decade now. A friend of mine turned me onto this shampoo, at first I was extremely skeptical, but after a few weeks of use I can say my hair is now definitely thicker and fuller. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t have an awful smell like other hair regrowth shampoos, and it leaves your hair feeling nice and smooth. For anyone who struggles with hair loss, this shampoo with really help recuperate what you lost and add some more for a fuller and thicker look.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product in conjunction with the Ultrax vitamin supplement. I applied just a small squirt of the hair lush gel over my entire scalp and within weeks I noticed the thinning part of my scalp was showing signs of thicker hair growth.  Besides having a sweet fragrance, this product goes a very long way since you only need to apply once daily a small dab about the size of a nickel or dime.  I noticed the rest of my hair where I am not thinning was growing at a much faster rate than before.</li>
    <li> After trying other products and fails I Bought this product for my husband, he has thinking hair, reviews were decent so we thought we would give it a try. After a few weeks he and I started to notice more hair growing plus thicker. He will continue to use it until he gets the results he&#x27;s looking for!!! Great product!</li>
    <li> This amazing leave-in hair formula has done wonders for my thin, brittle hair. For years the ends of my hairs have been snapping off without me even tugging on them or with a swish of a hair brush! After using this product by Ultra Labs, I have noticed a complete change in hair strength and thickness! I can now give my hair a little tug &amp; brush without it breaking off! I have never been happier with a product like this. It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do. My hair is no longer brittle and feels thicker and stronger than ever!!!! I am in love with this treatment and recommend it to anyone who deals with thin, brittle hair. You will love it!</li>
    <li> I gave this treatment serum as a gift to my dad who is nearing sixty years old and just now showing signs of hair loss. His hair is actually great for his age but I bought him this sort of as a joke (&amp;#34;haha you&#x27;re getting old&amp;#34; and what not). He doesn&#x27;t have bald spots or anything like that but his hair is getting noticeably thinner. I visited him at his house four weeks after giving him this gift and turns out he actually tried it. Surprisingly, I could see a difference in his hair. It seemed to be thicker and almost more colorful. We spent almost a half an hour that day talking about how well the serum actually worked (also joking about his old age... which is nothing to be ashamed of by the way). He claimed that he noticed a difference in his hair just two weeks after applying the serum but I can&#x27;t say for sure if that is true or not. And I&#x27;m sure for someone with much longer hair than my dad&#x27;s that this product would take much longer to produce the results desired. But all in all, the serum produced quality results for my dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product took my dad&#x27;s great, aged hair and actually made it even better. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but I think its worth it if you&#x27;re desperate to make a slight improvement in your hair.</li>
    <li> I was surprised, I saw some hair regrowth as a result of using this.</li>
    <li> Its a great product!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried the Shampoo and after that I was hooked on Ultralax Labs. This is the latest and perhaps greatest product I&#x27;ve tried thus far. While the shampoo and conditioner act immediate damage control, the vitamins act as long term health, this product is perfect for an almost immediate glow. I love this line of products so much. My hair was damaged and broken and now it&#x27;s nearly an inch longer and shiny, so shiny and luscious.</li>
    <li> Do not buy!! Fake reviews. All the Ultra lab products are TERRIBLE!! It&#x27;s a scam!!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair loss treatment! I have noticed that my hair is thicker and fuller since I began using this product!</li>
    <li> I have always had thin hair, but as I get older it has become brittle &amp; even more thin especially around the crown of my head. I started using Ultra Labs Hair Surge shampoo &amp; loved the results so much that I decided to try this serum, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It feels gooood as you massage it into your scalp and it&#x27;s not greasy so I can style my hair the way I like. Ultra Labs products are gentle on my sensitive skin which is a huge plus for me. I have found I can use the serum in between shampooing and when I brush or comb my hair there is no breakage like before. Even the hair around the crown of my head is thicker, I don&#x27;t see my scalp the way I used to. My hair now looks so much healthier, fuller, yes LUSH! The perfect name for a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Really works, and fast too, I was so surprised. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum in addition to the Ultrax shampoo. Very similar to the shampoo in smell (typical salon product smell). The serum keeps my hair moisturized without weighing it down. It gives a nice lift and adds noticeable body. It goes in and distributes easily throughout. It leaves a slight tingling sensation on the scalp. Easily can be used in addition to styling products like gel, wax, and creams.</li>
    <li> After trying the shampoo, I decided to try another product from this line. And like the shampoo, I love it! It is not heavy and it makes my hair feel softer and it is making my hair thicker and just looks healthier overall. I think I have finally found a brand of hair care products that works!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to both men and women.You can instantly see the difference, with your hair looking and feeling healthier, fuller, and shinier.</li>
    <li> I am convinced that most of the reviews are fake. No doubt about it. I used this for two months, it was a little bottle and had to make sure I used it sparingly. It did nothing. It smelled nice, but that was about it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  Could tell a difference immediately as the caffeine causes tingling that lets you know something is definitely going on.  The gel is thin enough to work into your hair and not weigh it down and make it look greasy, as some products can.  Have only been using it for a short time and can definitely see thicker hair.  Used to be able to see the scalp and wanted something that was going to offer both long-term and short-term help.  The shampoo and conditioner are also very effective and with this added to my toolbox, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results.  People are already asking me if I&#x27;ve gotten a hair cut or new hair style and I know it&#x27;s because my hair looks thicker and is easier for me to work with.  Excellent product if you have thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Initial Impression Review:&lt;br /&gt;- The product can be used on wet/dry hair, which is really convenient. Personally, I like to use it on wet/damp hair while the pores are open and ready to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;- The texture of this is GREAT! It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like you put gunky gel into it. And once I was done massaging it into my scalp, even my hands felt really nice and soft!&lt;br /&gt;- The smell isn&#x27;t a favorite of mine: isopropyl alcohol and a hint of menthol/peppermint. But you really only get that whiff when you put the product right under your nose (which I have done). It&#x27;s not strong enough to deter you from using the product, and you can&#x27;t smell it in your hair afterwards, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;- There is this beginning tingle you feel on your scalp, which must mean it&#x27;s working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pair it with the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge shampoo product, and they complement each other well. Hopefully, I&#x27;ll remember to come back here with an update after giving my hair a chance to grow out!</li>
    <li> When a friend suggested Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment I was definitely skeptical since I haven&#x27;t had much success with products in the past.  But after a few weeks I was made a believer.  Not only was my hair growing thicker, stronger and had so has much more body.  But the places I had been seeing significant hair loss are growing hair back.  I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with this product and the results I received.</li>
    <li> When I hit my mid-life crisis I began noticing that my hair was thinning. Since then, for many years I spent way too much money on serums and ointments from my pharmacy, from eBay and many hair salons. Not only did none of them work, but most of the stuff left my hair sticky and unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to a friend of mine, a few months ago I found out about Ultrax Hair Lush. Well the results are nothing short of amazing. My hair is getting thicker and definitely more manageable. I would recommend that anyone with thinning hair give it a try.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from hair loss but I recently did a home color job and ruined my hair. I normally have a thick full head of hair and after that disaster my hair was actually light and airy. I panicked and tried several things (including coconut oil)  but nothing seemed to help. I heard about the good results from using caffeine hair products so I tried Ultrax Labs Hair Lush | Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment Formula Serum.  I like using serums on my hair and I like the way they smell.. The first thing I noticed was that the Ultrax Lab serum felt tingly on your head.. almost like you were putting peppermint oil on your hair.  Some people might not like the smell but I think it smells good. I use it about 3 times a week and noticed my hair was feeling better after about 2 weeks.  I still use my other serum too as it is more oily but I like using both of them because this product actually helps your hair get healthy.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush is the best product I have ever used in my entire life! Never before has my hair been more soft, manageable, and luxurious, but its also really shiny too. It starts working on your hair instantly. You will visibly notice the difference in your hair within one use of this product. Ultrax Labs Hair Lush is the best product on the mark right now! I recommend giving it a try to find out how great it really works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Leave in conditioner that makes my hair feel so soft and bouncy. It feels fuller already!</li>
    <li> I have been on a mission to restore my loss of hair and to regain some thickness. I have been very satisfied with the Ultrax Labs Surge shampoo (see my review) &amp; added their Hair Lush  serum component to my regime. It&#x27;s exciting! Not only the Lush enables my hair to become lusterous &amp; manageable (I like my hair super straight &amp; thick like Cleopatra&#x27;s) creating a much fuller, shinier, and manageable head of hair!! Noticeably healthier (nourished roots&#x3D; healthy hair). I had been so self -conscious when the hair loss became more significant (getting older?). I do eat healthy ---NOT an underlying issue that would create hair loss/thinning. Now;  apply the Lush on damp, use a wide tooth comb to de-tangle hair. TIP: pump a dallop in your palm, bend over head down, work from the back of head hairline to the top (lightly massaging) to the front forehead line) return to standing position (its good when the blood flows to your roots-stimulates!) Let the Lush digest for a few mins before you begin your hair dry /styling. Start from the front around face to back. Ok --SEE how much fuller your hair looks &amp; feels?! Best to you!! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Light weight serum that enhances hair flexibility to bounce back to its  natural texture and control split ends.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for hair loss and thinning hair.  Hair appears thicker and shinier after only a few uses.  The concentrated light weight serum does not weigh down hair or make it appear greasy.  This is a great product for anyone looking to stimulate hair growth and it smells good too.  I would recommend Ultrax Labs Hair Lush for healthier, fuller hair.</li>
    <li> My hair had been thinning over the past couple years and i couldnt find any product that worked until i came accross the Ultrax Lush. Since using this over the past few months i have seen significantly noticable hair growth and less thinning! I would highly reccomend the Ultrax Lush!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this product would work at all to be honest. I had heard of it but didn&#x27;t know anyone personally who had used it. After seeing it retailed for triple the amazon price I had to get it. So glad I did!! Its not sticky and not heavily fragrant it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like most leave in products and after a few weeks of use my hair is definently thicker and less breakage. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Man I was pretty skeptical about this company but all their products are working for me. The spots that were thinning are now getting thicker slowly but surely. I noticed the thinning early since I have longer hair and this really helped it from becoming a problem. Its non greasy and discreet which is also very nice because my gf doesn&#x27;t notice!</li>
    <li> This is similar to some other great products out there, but definitely the best for its price. You can more than what you pay for with this. It works great and gives the hair a very clean look and feel. This is the best thing because it doesn’t appear artificial. Definitely consider it.</li>
    <li> This Product increases the volume of your hair in such a short amount of time. 5-7 days. As opposed to 4-6 weeks. You&#x27;ll notice a  thicker consistency the individual strands of hair are. Most other products are very sticky and cause scalp irritation. But this product is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t cause build up. Your hair hair appears thicker, healthier and with volume comes bounce. Not to mention the split ends look to be less also. Nice thing about this line of products is you don&#x27;t need a lot of product for it to work. Just small amounts will do. Worth the price and for what it does.</li>
    <li> This supplement has a form of caffeine that will stay in the scalp upon application. It works great because you just pump some product into your hand with the easy to use applicator and leave it in your hair. You can tell your hair will thicken as the caffeine works it&#x27;s way into your bloodstream promoting hair growth. I noticed that with the use of the caffeine product the split ends in my hair started to disappear. The product has a nice minty smell to it as well leaving your hair smelling good all day long as an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, lightweight, and really promotes hair growth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it right after showering when my hair is still wet.  I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily, and I&#x27;m seeing a lot of new growth.</li>
    <li> For androgenetic alopecia don&#x27;t work !!!</li>
    <li> Hair Lush is a wonder product! I have tried many products and spent a lot of money trying to thicken my thinning hair.  After using this for a month I have noticed my hair feels fuller and looks healthier. I would definitely recommend this product if you want results!</li>
    <li> This product really works. I&#x27;ve used other products in the past but none of them made my hair as thick and luxurious as Hair Lush. I highly recommend this product to everybody experiencing thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I  LOVE this product! ! I&#x27;ve used it for just over a month &amp; it&#x27;s stopped ALL breakage! The 1st 2 weeks I used it daily, then every other day &amp; it&#x27;s AMAZING! ! NO shedding &amp; NO more breakage!</li>
    <li> I was recommended this flight by a friend who was suffering major hair loss. I went ahead with sampling the product and I must say that I noticed improvement in under 30days. Not only does the product smell great but it&#x27;s also very light and ease to spread. I am absolutely amazed by the results!</li>
    <li> Pricy for the size. Works ok</li>
    <li> After seeing the good results from this company’s shampoo (Ultrax Labs Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Shampoo) I purchased the serum. My hair is damaged, dead and thinning from coloring and different heat treatments over the years. This serum was extremely helpful in getting back the thickness and shine my hair used to have. I have tried Keratin treatments at a few salons, as well as different argon/Moroccan oils and a few hair masks... this thickening serum helped support my hair re-growth! As opposed to sitting in Keratin treatments that take a few hours, this product is top-notch, something you can do everyday from home, in just a few seconds to help your hair if it is thinning or damaged. You just need a dime sized amount a few times a week for this to really work! Will definitely purchase another bottle when mine is running low.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo and wasn&#x27;t expecting much (due to the futility of other products)  but I noticed  immediate results in the fullness of my hair My hair has been thinning for years and ultrax labs has delivered.  I  love how my hair its looking and growing in. Not only is it fuller but its shinier.  There is no build up. Its not sticky or anything. And you don&#x27;t even need to use a lot. All it takes is a small coin sizes dab and you&#x27;re good to go. This is a must buy!!!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs&#x27;s Hair Lush is a product that I recommend 100% !!!! I have very thin hair and was losing my hair slowly. I saw great success instantly from the first time I used it.  On my first use, I was able to see that my thin hair was looking a lot thicker, feeling healthier, and shinier. My advice to everyone, make sure you keep it in long! The longer you use keep it in, the better it will turn out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must buy!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know this product before a friend talked to me about it and let me try it. Now i&#x27;ve ordered two bottles and results are surprisingly satisfied. I have a thinning hair but since i&#x27;ve been using Hair Lush my hair looks better, this product reactivate weak areas. It has some caffeine component that work like a stimulation treatment to get a thicker hair. My girl has also been using and the results are similar</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair and this has really helped! . It&#x27;s very easy to use.My hair is definitely thicker than before. I use the serum every day and it seems to have slowed down my hair loss as well. I believe that the caffeine stimulates the hair growth. My hair has less breakage as well.</li>
    <li> This Hair Lush treatment really works!I apply this to my scalp and roots atleast twice a day on wet or dry hair and I&#x27;ve seen great results so far. Im seeing new growth around my hair line that I hadn&#x27;t see grow for months now! And my hair feels so much thicker. The serum has a pleasant scent and gives added moisture to my strands without weighing it down or making it oily. The product also isn&#x27;t sticky or leave any residue. Its so easy to use so I&#x27;m going to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I absolutely had to for this product. I use this treatment with a combination of Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Shampoo. My hair is so much thicker already and it has only been a short amount of time since I started using a combination of these products. This treatment is leave in and it does not make your hair greasy unlike other treatments I have tried. If anything, it actually adds more volume. I leave the product in for about 2 days before washing it out to make sure it penetrated deeply through my hair follicles. I have highlights in my hair so I can notice when my hair starts to grow out more so and let me tell you my hair added an inch or 2 in the past month. I know this stuff works and I will voucher for it anytime. This has truly helped me feel my best with my beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is so thin, flat and lifeless but after trying this product, it brought fullness and bounce to my hair. I have brittle hair from overstyling it and this product helped bring my hair back to life. It made it thick and full and gave it great volume and body. My hair sheds a lot too, but after using this product, I have noticed that I shed significantly less. I&#x27;m happy with how healthier my hair feels. It helped my hair feel stronger and easier to manage.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Hair Lush has done wonders for my hair. After using it everyday for a few weeks my hair has gone from being thin and brittle to strong, more lush and way fuller. I no longer worry every time I use a brush that my hair is going to break.  The serum is also not too sticky and smells nice.  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Ultrax Shampoo and figured I would give this product a chance as well. Ever since the birth of my daughter I have definitely experienced thinner hair. I love this product!! My hair feels thicker and it has this awesome shine. I would recommend this product to anyone experiencing thinning hair. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!!</li>
    <li> This little serum has been a godsend for me. I put it on when my hair is still damp from the shower, and it&#x27;s light, and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy. On top of that, it actually works! I&#x27;ve been trying different products for a few months now, but this is far and away the best results I&#x27;ve seen yet. My hair looks fuller, and the actual strands even seem thicker. After two weeks I really see a difference in my locks, and I&#x27;m starting to feel confident again!</li>
    <li> Yet another great product from this company. I have not been using it long but I can already tell a difference in the overall quality of my hair. This. Serum does everything it says it will do. Its a great compliment to the other line of products sold by this company. Great product it came highly recommended. It did not dissapointe.</li>
    <li> I use this and the shampoo that is made by the same company, and both have improved the condition of my hair and made it less prone to breaking. I don&#x27;t usually like to put serums in my hair because they tend to make my hair look greasy, but this one is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down. It makes my hair more resilient and over time has helped it get thicker. You only have to use a small amount -- so the small bottle lasts quite a while. And it really does improve hair fullness and condition.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Very affective product. I have seen rapid results in less than 3 weeks of using this product. No difficult directions  just simply squirt a little and massage on to hair and you will notice your hair more fuller where it was once very thin and breaking. Defintely 100% Worth the buy. Amazon Verified</li>
    <li> Ultrax has been my go-to place for my hair. I&#x27;ve tried other supplements that didn&#x27;t do the trick for me. I have really thin hair and I started applying the Hair Lush over a few weeks and I noticed my hair has been getting thicker at an extremely fast rate, I get compliments on the feel of my hair and people notice I have a significant amount of volume then I had previously. The product doesn&#x27;t have any funky smells or side effects, and just does what it is meant to do! This is an absolutely must if you want thicker hair that looks and feels great. Very safe ingredients in these products and truly deliver what they say. T</li>
    <li> I just got this and i love it . I love how it makes my hair feel.It smell great.</li>
    <li> This product is really restores everything you need as far as hair growth is concerned.It smells really good and this is a fact that it really works.You will see amazing results practically overnight.You are getting your moneys worth so order today and enjoy!</li>
    <li> During dental hygiene school I noticed that I started to lose my hair-- I was really stressed for national board exams. I decided to try this product and had amazing results. My hair is finally starting to look what it did in high school.</li>
    <li> Wow, works wonders at smoothing out my split dry ends.  Works well as a thickening treatment  with instant results.  This product is also non greasy as promised. If you have dry thinning hair you should definitely try this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from thinning and fine hair for countless years, since I was a teenager. This stuff really seems to help. My hair has always been pretty fine, which makes the thinning of it all the more apparent. I&#x27;ll take any advantage I can get, since for me it has been an issue for as long as I can remember. It&#x27;s not going to make you look like you have a full head of hair again or anything magical, but it will thicken the hair you do have and add to the coverage you have currently. I have to say it&#x27;s worth buying, it&#x27;s made a noticeable difference for me.</li>
    <li> The perfect addition to the Ultrax shampoo. I like this product because a little bit goes a long way, and it makes the shampoo last longer than it would without the serum! Before I found out about Ultrax products, I thought the only way to go about stimulating hair growth was with pill supplements in the form of DHT blockers. These products do the same thing, and easily replace the shampoo/serums you were using beforehand! A must have for hair growth, and easier than remembering to take a pill every day.</li>
    <li> There was the &amp;#34;Miracle In the Meadowlands&amp;#34;, the miracle of the Jews exodus from Egypt, and most recently, the Ultrax Hair gel miracle. Just a dab a day, and almost instantaneously you will feel the magic happening. You see an obvious difference, between this and other hair-thickner gels/shampoos. The main difference being those don&#x27;t deliver, while this was one does! The price tag might seem high, but is a steal compared to similar products. The pump is extremely convenient , insuring there are no spills and you get the desired amount. After just a few uses, your hair will feel thicker and healthier and you will feel more confident. After a week, the compliments will be rolling in, and you will never be able to go back. This is a product, that I would definitely re-buy, and will be re buying monthly. Thank you, Ultrax Labs for changing my life, and giving me my confidence back</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when seeing all the 5 star reviews, thinking hmmm, are these real reviews, or people from the company? These are real reviews because it really works. It&#x27;s expensive, but one bottle I&#x27;d imagine lasts a very long time. Very little is required. Using this along with the Ultra Labs shampoo is just awesome.    Don&#x27;t expect miracles, I&#x27;ve been thinning for some time. My hair within a few weeks looks much healthier, thicker, and just overall I have some hope remaining.    It works! I don&#x27;t know if this will re-grow hair, but I&#x27;ve notice it works much better with front hair thinning (as I also am starting to lose hair in my crown).    I&#x27;d still use minoxidil in combination if you&#x27;re dealing with hair loss. The two combined might give some hope, along with using the shampoo.    The smell is great too, it&#x27;s not sticky, it absorbs into the hair/scalp very fast. You&#x27;ll have no problem styling your hair after.    Can&#x27;t say enough about this gel</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times but I can really see a difference.  A small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My hair had been shedding for over 7 years now. I tried multiple hair loss restorative and nothing helped. I was told about Hair Lush and thought smoke was being blown...but what did I have to lose? After about 5 uses my shedding has stopped about 75-80% and I haven&#x27;t finished the first bottle. It&#x27;s as amazing as it says and I would recommend to anyone to go right ahead and give it a try. Thanx ultra labs hair lush!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair lush as my little secret weapon alongside some Shea moisture products for curl and shine. It&#x27;s been tough since going natural a few months ago, I started shedding hair everywhere and noticed I had hair much much thinner in most spots. This serum has helped me build back thicker groupings of hair as well as stronger hair. I no longer lose so much hair when i comb or brush throughout the day, which used to be soooooo annoying ugh. Ever since i &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; my bf&#x27;s bottle a few times i started getting my own and strongly recommend this especially if you&#x27;re growing out your hair.</li>
    <li> It is best to start using a small amount to see how the hair will react. It helps to work the serum deep into the scalp with a nice long massage for the best results. I notice hair thickening relatively quickly. The smell is interesting, but not bad.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the size of the bottle deter you from buying it. This serum has made a huge difference with my hair. It has thickened my hair and left it both bouncy and shiny.  Your hair tends to show less breakage after a few uses. One of the best things about this serum is that it does not weigh down your hair or leave it feeling greasy/sticky. The serum doesn&#x27;t tingle or sting. It has a subtle, but nice, scent.</li>
    <li> Hi!  Wow!  This product has stimulated my hair growth!  Plus, my new hair is growing healthier and thicker than before!  I would recommend that anyone that would like thicker, healthier and faster growing hair try this product!  :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using Hair Lush with Hair Surge shampoo and the combination is doing wonders for my hair. The shedding has stopped, I don&#x27;t have hair all over my shirts anymore. I am beginning to see my hair look thicker and feel stronger. I love how Hair Lush feels. It&#x27;s not sticky or heavy in my hair. I have noticed changes in my hair since the first use of Hair Lush. Each strand of hair actually looks and feels thicker than before. I have tried so many different products, even prescriptions and nothing has worked the way Ultrax Labs Hair Lush has. I will no longer be looking for the product that works for my hair. I have finally found it. I will be using Hair Lush forever because it&#x27;s the first product that has made my hair look and feel thicker. I have been recommending Hair Lush to everyone who has been complimenting me and telling me how great my hair looks.</li>
    <li> This think is a little expensive and the amount of the product is not enough.I would say it works and the hair looks really healthy and the product has great consistency and smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;Literally is a very good product.I would recommended but i know is a lot of money.Works for me and for the type of hair i have.</li>
    <li> For years my hair was harassed by the emergence of splits ends and recently, it was bombarded by hair loss. Strands of hair were dull in color and thin in shape. I use the product after shampooing and conditioning my hair to push for better absorbency into my scalp. It is important to note that you must massage the serum into your hair and scalp to have better results. Unlike most of the other serums that I have tried, this serum completely absorbs into my hair and on my scalp and leaves no residual residues. After waiting about 20 minutes after applying the serum, I could not even remember I had put it on in the first place as it didn&#x27;t feel as if I had any product on my hair. Few weeks of usage showed tremendous results in regard to the reparation of the health of my hair. I noticed a significant decrease in the number of splits ends and tiny follicles of hair were growing in places where my hair has been falling off. Overall, this product is worth your money and try it if you are suffering from thin hairs and hair loss.</li>
    <li> I received a sample and man what a great product it is. Works for my hair and has changed rapidly!</li>
    <li> I got this product initially as a sample with the Ultrax Caffeine Hair Loss Shampoo. I tried the serum for several days as a little goes a long way. I use the serum after my shower in the morning and that really gives my hair a great feel. I do think the smell of the serum is a bit strange but it wears off quick enough. It&#x27;s a good product for me and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> As weird as it sounds to use something called a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; this is a pretty good product. My hair started getting thinner, I started getting a little depressed about it... ended up shopping around and ordering this. It actually helps! Obviously not going to thicken your hair instantly, but after a few weeks of using this my hair felt and looked noticeable thicker, much to my delight. That, and it smells pretty nice too to boot! I think I&#x27;m going to just keep using this on a permanent basis from now on.</li>
    <li> This would be the best gift for my sister having hair problem. Caffeine is FDA approved and scientifically safe, so i wouldn&#x27;t worry to my sister using this product! She has so thin hair that easily breaks and fall. This product says it would instantly thicken hair because of the advance caffeine serum and the best stimulation for the hair. It also re-activate and jump-start the hair follicles to grow healthy hair again and boost its growth. I can also use this product since this is also safe for both men and women! I will buy this product again if i see effectiveness to my sister. The price is worth the try than having a bad hair day for women!</li>
    <li> Used as directed, there was not enough in the container to last a week, so it&#x27;s impossible to tell how well it might work. And at the price, I&#x27;m not willing to buy enough of them to find out.</li>
    <li> Works really well with the shampoo...my hair is super dry, so I almost always leave my conditioner in for 30 plus minutes or longer for a soft finish.  It&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing leave-in serum that helped my brittle, dry thin, short hair become healthy, full and grow again! After using for a week I saw and felt instant results. The active ingredient, Biotin helps with hair growth and is exactly what I needed instead of taking the vitamin.  Best if used after shampoo and conditioner and apply when hair is damp before styling.</li>
    <li> I really love this company and especially love their thickening serum. The product is one of the few serums I have tried that does not leave your hair looking oily or leave a substance on your hair. After about a week I started getting compliments on the added body and bounce to my hair! I have been using it for a few weeks in conjunction with the Ultrax Labs shampoo and they have been doing wonders for my thin hair! My hair has seen some growth, added thickness, and an overall healthy feeling. I would definitely recommend this product and Ultrax Labs to anyone who needs something extra to make their hair feel and look fuller and healthier.</li>
    <li> I think the hair lush is just great. It goes on clean, clear and has a pleasant scent. My hair feels thicker and feels fuller. I am very impressed and I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I started losing my hair a few years back. I use the Ultrax Labs Shampoo, but wanted a leave in product I could put in my hair right after I get out of the shower.  It makes my hair look much thicker right away and leaves it looking silky smooth.  I&#x27;m a big fan, and will continue to use this along with their shampoo.  I have really gotten great results!</li>
    <li> This product can be used for both men and women. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of substance is in this product! It went on wet and dried my hair out! Would have sent it back but before I knew it - the entire amount was used!</li>
    <li> I am currently on my second bottle of Ultrax now and so far I&#x27;m really pleased with the results. My hair seems to be thicker, stronger, and overall healthier than it was just a few weeks ago. I use it every other day; just two pumps is all it takes for me. Could not be any easier or inconvenient. It&#x27;s definitely a good investment for my money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thicker smoother .I&#x27;m  feeling 21 again . I had my doubts .. I just been through so many brands, I was really  going to give up and let nature takes its course, be bald . There&#x27;s always a great product out there for everyone and mine is Lush!!!!</li>
    <li> This product controls my hair frizz and makes my short broken hair around the hairline appear healthy and thick. I no longer blow dry my bang area and sides as much because using the serum my hair blends well and keep smooth and shiny without the residue or oilyness some products leave behind. My hair is not breaking and i am getting compliments from friends. I recommend using Ultra Labs Hair Lush--it does a great job.</li>
    <li> Using the all 3 ultrax labs products for it to work is best.The serum will leave a slight oily feel BUT if applied to the scalp with the tips of your fingers it will instantly give you volume, as well as coating the strands of hair to aide it in the growing/thickening process.&lt;br /&gt; Dont use too much! smaller than a pea sized drop per section.&lt;br /&gt;with that being said, no one wants to waist their money on something that might or might not work, These things weren&#x27;t a waist of money for me and it has definitely worked. :)</li>
    <li> This fantastic  hair formula has done wonders for me. my ends  have been breaking  off simply by using a  hair brush! After using this t by Ultra Labs, I have noticed a complete change in the strength and thickness of my hair! I can now give my hair a  brush and it wont break off! I have never had such results  with a product like this ever!!!! I  love with this product  and recommend it to anyone who has breaking or thinning hair  . You will love it!</li>
    <li> After 4 weeks, my hair feels amazing and totally different from before. My hair used to be thin, weak, and brittle at the ends. This serum has softened that coarse feel that I used to have. It feels great! After washing my hair, I would apply the serum and style as usual. My hair never felt so soft and smooth in a long time! I also have been using the Ultrax Labs supplement and shampoo; together I feel like my hair has grown stronger, the brittle and coarseness has disappeared, and I don&#x27;t loose chunks of hair easily anymore. This product has relieved my fear of losing hair!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair will be after it keeps growing this healthy. I don&#x27;t think I will stop this routine anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed this product .The solution is not greasy on my scalp, there is barely any scent and it does not add weight to my scalp. I live the way it breathes. I can use it with my normal shampoo, and I am finding that there is new and stronger growth. I am so glad i can get this here on amazon now. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and I am quite happy.</li>
    <li> Very impressed so far. After only about a week of using this I have definitely noticed an improvement in my hair, it looks and FEELS a lot thicker and healthier. My hair is naturally very thin and whispy and I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t see major improvements but my hair is already looking better than it has in years. Also, I have noticed a decrease in hair fall in the shower. Before I would notice around 10-15 hairs in my hands after massaging my scalp with shampoo but now I&#x27;ll be lucky if I see 5 hairs so I will definitely keep using this product and hopefully the improvements keep coming!</li>
    <li> I love this company&#x27;s products, and this one is my new favorite!! The serum is so revitalizing and invigorating for damaged, thinning hair! You only need a coin-sized amount a day and the results are worth every penny! It leaves no build-up or chemical smell like other products on the market. My hair has grown in thicker and fuller and my scalp feels healthier too! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with damaged, thinning hair. Mine no longer falls out when I brush it and I&#x27;m ecstatic!</li>
    <li> This works like a charm! It smells nice and applies nicely so there isn&#x27;t much buildup. Right away you can feel it tingling a bit. Prolonged use will make your hair thick with life and energy</li>
    <li> Since I was super impressed with the Ultrax Labs shampoo for thinning hair I was anxious to get the Ultrax Lab Hair Lush Serum. I&#x27;ve always had thin hair and struggle flat, stringy, bodiless hair.  After years and money wasted on so many products I’m finally experiencing success for my thinning hair.  I&#x27;ve noticed an incredible difference in both volume and fullness.  My hair actually looks and feels thicker, healthier and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;When I purchase products I am usually disappointed in the lack of results and often give up because I haven’t seen results. Shockingly I felt a difference in my hair immediately after my first use as well as a noticeable, visible difference in just a few days.  I was extremely excited when other people started to complimenting me on my hair. That’s when I knew for sure that this product really works!  .  I&#x27;ve gain more confidence in my appearance as a result of it.&lt;br /&gt;What I found to be so unique about this serum is that it is weightless; there is absolutely no greasy residue when you apply it or even hours later.  It gives off a cooling sensation when applied which I find super relaxing and  It also has a clean refreshing sent that I really enjoy.</li>
    <li> It truly helps with hair loss, you can use it while your hair is wet or dry.the smell is great.i wouldn&#x27;t go a day without this product.</li>
    <li> After suffering with limp, wimpy locks on the top of my head for most of my life, and trying other products that left my hair a sticky mess . . . and even limper because they weighed it down . . . I approached Hair Lush with a skeptical eye. Much to my surprise, a tiny, dime-sized amount gave my hair, and my bangs in particular, a look that is so full, I can hardly believe it. Hair Lush lives up to it&#x27;s name and more, because as the weeks have gone by, my hair looks thicker, has new body and even holds a curl!  When I die, they will have to pry the bottle of Hair Lush out of my cold, dead hands.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few months and unfortunately I have not seen any results.  I continued the use based on a previous review but again I have not noticed a difference.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!  After only one use, you can notice fuller and thicker hair. This product also works very well in conjuction with the Ultrax Labs caffein shampoo. Using both of these products together helps for a healthier and more managable head of hair. This product is also easy to apply and is non-greasy which allows for a hassle-free, clean application. I stongly reccommend using this product.</li>
    <li> We all know that Ultrax Labs makes a number of hair thickening products suitable for men and women and this is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;It is a leave in formula that instantly thickens hair and added fullness and body to my thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;I really found that this product does wonders for thinning hair and I found some benefits when using it.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves no oily residue in the hair or on the scalp, making it touchable and soft, clean and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed after a few uses only that my hair had more body and looked bouncy, and I could actually see and feel that my hair was thicker. In addition, I could see new hair growth since I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair only 2 or 3 times a week, and there is no build up from this product left in my hair to weight it down or cause flaking.&lt;br /&gt;The Ultrax Labs Hair Lush will last long for me, since a small amount will do the trick. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> I just love all of the Ultrax products!&lt;br /&gt;This serum makes the hair feel full and luscious and look voluminous and SUPER glossy!&lt;br /&gt;So glad to have found it at a cheaper price on amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the natural benefits of this product. Long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only requires a VERY small amount for whole head of hair. This bottle lasts nearly forever!</li>
    <li> I just got this, used it a few times and voil&amp;agrave;, my hair appears thicker and healthier, and the best part is it has a natural bounce and body to it. The most important part for me is that it does not make my hair sticky, or gooey, and stiff like some products out there that I have used in the past. In all due reality, I  have used about five other products and nothing just quit like this one. I cannot speak for all, but it worked for my thin hair problem. Definitely worth a try for the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome! My hair is already thicker and super shiny! Plus it smells great</li>
    <li> it has a light and sweet smell to it not to overbearing it looks exactly as in the picture. all ultrax labs products are top notch.  i tested it on a friend of mine and he says it has a cooling sensation. i believe this will make a great product for substantial hair growth and thickening!</li>
    <li> I was born with &amp;#34;Baby Fine&amp;#34; hair. I&#x27;m now in my sixties and STILL had baby fine hair until I started using Ultra Labs hair lush. Thankfully, I still have a full head of hair but it has always been flat and lifeless. It only took the barber about 5 minutes to cut it. Now, I&#x27;m having fun just running my hands through my own hair. It is much fuller and thicker. And . . .a little bit goes a long way. So, it is a real bargain. My daughter also noticed the difference. This is just simply one of those products that does what it says it will and doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I highly recommend it to anyone who, like me, have been plagued with limp, fine hair all their lives.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair thickening gel for my extremely fine and thin hair. After the first use I could already tell a difference. My hair had significantly more volume and even had more shine. You don&#x27;t even need a lot since a little drop goes a long way. Just make sure to massage the gel into your scalp and roots, not your ends. I have tried it both, on dry and wet hair and it seems to work better on wet hair for me. I would definitely recommend this gel to anyone who wants more volume that looks natural, rather than over-styled.</li>
    <li> Because you leave this product in your hair, it has more potential to affect the actual appearance of you hair, and that is what it does. Further, it does it immediately, after one use! You can instantly see the difference, with your hair looking and feeling healthier, fuller, and shinier. The serum has long term effects as well, as the caffeine and other ingredients penetrate deep into the scalp in order to prevent hair loss and stimulate new hair growth. Caffeine is newer on the market of hair care products, but there is a good body of research behind it, showing that it works. This product further proves that, and at a very minimal cost! It is currently just ten dollars, and lasts quite awhile, just a dabble does it for me, though I am a male with average hair. In combination with other Ultrax Labs hair care products, this will change the look of your hair completely. Plus it feel and smells great when you put it on. With so much to gain, and so little to lose, anyone serious about their hair should try this innovative serum.</li>
    <li> this has made my hair so much thicker and healthier. my hair was very damaged and thin. gave it a natural shine and has made it way eiser to style. my split ends are practically gone.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I cut my hair, and wanted to grow it back out! I started using this product, and I can tell the difference within a week! My hair was growing, with minimal hair loss. It felt thicker. Which I love that feeling. My hair also looked healthier and fuller. This line of products does an amazing job. I will definitely be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I was shopping around for something like this and i&#x27;m glad i chose this one! I&#x27;m already seeing results! YESSSS!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this product within weeks it was giving me fuller thicker hair. If you have issues with fine hair or hair loss this is definitely a product to try!</li>
    <li> like this stuff--like the smell and texture--don&#x27;t know about the &amp;#34;growth&amp;#34; claim, but it definitely looks thicker when used!</li>
    <li> Having had baby fine thin hair my whole life... and looking into various products... I don&#x27;t like the sticky feel of most products... so, I&#x27;ve been getting the Ultrax products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need to apply a little... which is very very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the shampoo first... now this... great combo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to find this product that even smells good too! ~ What a Find!</li>
    <li> Thicker, luscious hair right away, as soon as you use it!  And at the same time the Caffeine stimulates your hair follicles making my hair actually grow as thick as it looks!  If you use this together with Ultrax Labs other products, you can&#x27;t&#x27; go wrong!  My hair stopped shedding, appeared thicker and longer and generally feels healthier!  This serum does not leave any greast residue and no one will know you used it, they&#x27;ll just compliment on how great your hair looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is thinning or balding, use the entire set daily to keep your hair and it will grow back!</li>
    <li> Hair Lush is a product I will buy again.  It does thicken your hair and it makes my hair feel fuller on my head.  I can tell it&#x27;s working because when I ride my bike with the wind blowing through my hair it feels different.  It&#x27;s thicker hair and I am excited about the results.  Also, it&#x27;s a gel so it is quite easy to apply and quick in the morning.  I have actually had compliments about me &amp;#34;changing&amp;#34; hairstyle.  I have recommended this to many of my friends.</li>
    <li> This stimulating leave in serum does the trick! My mom started using this and her thin hair now has a healthier, more luxurious and thick appearance. Her hair has more body due to the thickness and she can actually style her hair the way she likes, which she hadn&#x27;t been able to do prior to daily use of the serum. The results are noticeable to others too, as she has received compliments on her hair since using Ultrax Labs hair products. A little of the serum used daily goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Thin hair runs in my genes for men so as a young guy I needed a product paired with others to help me out.  I was skeptical of any product promising the results such as this treatment but am I glad I was desperate!  This product delivered and after only a few treatments results were evident!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much! It made my hair look great and made me feel great! I would definitely recommend to buy this product if you are looking to get fuller, thicker, and shinier healthy hair!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the results! This has worked to help thicken my thin hair, it looks and feels much fuller. I feel like I have erased years of damage from my hair. After applying it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or flakey and has a nice aroma. I definitely recommend this product to help with thinning hair!</li>
    <li> Very cool product.  It&#x27;s like a cross between a treatment serum and a hair gel.  Allows you to style hair for max volume.  It smells good too!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product to me. My hair has always been on the thin side, but recently, it feels thinner. I started using it and can immediately feel a difference in the thickness. My hair feels healthier, fuller, and the slight curls I already have seem more manageable now. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue as other products. Give it a try if you want thicker and fuller hair!</li>
    <li> Ultrax labs hair lush has been wonderful to me my hair was really thin and damaged, this product has transformed my hair completely. My sister can&#x27;t keep her hands off it!</li>
    <li> This serum delivers. My hair thickened up very quickly after using this product. I use the Ultrax Labs hair growth stimulating shampoo too and this product is a great complement to the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dollop of this nice thick serum is all it takes. Your hair is not greasy or weighed down with this product. I have very fine/thin hair that gets weighed down easily so I was actually kind of concerned to add a serum to my hair care regimen. I was pleasantly surprised. My usually stringy thin hair was full and had body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the nice familiar tingle when you apply it. I take it as a sign that it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about the Ultrax line. The one thing I will say is that it absolutely works! I&#x27;m convinced it works better when you use all products in the line.</li>
    <li> I bought this poduct after trying the Ultrax shampoo and seeing great results! While I noticed thickening at the root bed (and general fullness) after using the shampoo, the serum is actually expanding the hair strands along the shaft. Overall now I have thicker strands of hair to match my thicker growing hair. Miracles still do happen every day! I haven&#x27;t felt this confident about my hair in years!!</li>
    <li> Like many others describe, I had a horrific experience from the Ultrax Labs line of products.  I purchased the serum, conditioner, and shampoo hoping it would help my hairloss-or at worse not work.  It not only didn&#x27;t work for strengthening hair, slowing hair loss, or stimulating any new growth-it caused MASSIVE SHEDDING (as many have depicted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People, do your homework (as I apparently failed to do).  There are people complaining of massive sores on their heads, rapid shedding as I experienced, and brittle, dried out, broken hair as a result of these products.  I am not one that usually even takes the time to review things, which I know I should more often.  But, I could not resist reviewing my horrific experience with the Ultrax Labs products.  I have filed another claim with Amazon, which is being reviewed by their &amp;#34;concerns team&amp;#34;.  I am assuming like the last time, no result will come from this investigation.  I lost 12 months worth regrowth and hair loss stabilization which I attributed to Rogaine and legitimate products in a matter of weeks using these products.  The shedding was unbelievable.  Now, many weeks later after sticking to the products I used in the first place, I have once again greatly slowed the shedding to nearly what it was before Ultrax Labs products, and I have noticed new regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline, if you are going to try this-expect the worst.  Do not expect the worst to be, nothing happening.  Talk to a doctor, or thoroughly do your research before investing in hair loss products.  It will take me a long time to get that 12 months of hair back.</li>
    <li> The Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Thickening Treatment Formula Serum is phenomenal!!!  The serum leaves a beautiful sheen  without weighing your hair down. The best part of the serum is that it contains caffeine that stimulates hair growth. You only need a dime size to create a gorgeously thick, shiny and most importantly healthy head of hair. After a month of using the serum, my hair grown significantly and looks better than ever.</li>
    <li> Great use for someone who has an oily scalp (which in my case I did)</li>
    <li> I truly love this company&#x27;s products and the Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Serum does not disappoint.  My hair is thin and shoulder length so I really don&#x27;t need to use much, just a drop works really well for me.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks pretty much everyday and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily, I&#x27;ve tried other thickening serums and they always left my hair looking limp and greasy.  Since using the Ultrax Labs Serum I feel like my hair has more volume and tons of shine !! I don&#x27;t know about regrowth because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, but just in the few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using  it I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.  It&#x27;s well worth the price, a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this product and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> My hair has been falling out due to stress, my front hair line used to be full, now it is greasy and kinda fine and lifeless.I use this product every day, and I feel like I have soft, fluffy, shiny supermodel hair! All that greasy feeling on my scalp disappeared. The scent is pleasant, it&#x27;s absorbed very quickly, Not greasy whatsoever. it&#x27;s easy to carry in my bag, light and convenient bottle. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Lush gave me noticeably thicker hair after only a few uses!  Hair Lush is an impressive leave-in formula that instantly thickens hair and reactivates follicle growth.  Ultrax Labs has harnessed caffeine technology to power this incredible product, which is suitable for men or women.  Caffeine is highly effective because it increases production and growth of new hair follicles while reducing hair loss.  Ultrax Labs Hair Lush doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue, and the best part is that it has increased the fullness and body of my thinning hair.  I highly recommend this product to anyone with hair loss or thinning hair.  I read that it also works on beards!</li>
    <li> This serum is a great follow up with the shampoo. Smells nice and helps my hair feel thicker for longer periods of time. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does long term.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products because I think it&#x27;s a waste of time but I&#x27;m so impressed by this product. I&#x27;ve been losing hair for a few years now just because I got stuck with some really unfortunate genetics. As a result, I&#x27;ve tried many products to alleviate the situation to no avail. In comes Ultrax Labs Hair Lush which I found while searching on amazon since I had a gift card to use. The good reviews led me to give it a shot and I can&#x27;t say that I regret the purchase at all. Do yourselves a favor and at least try it out. It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks of my using it but I&#x27;ve already seen amazing improvements. I&#x27;m going to buy more of this magic product as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite thing to put in my hair are serums and this Ultrax Lab Hair Lush Caffeine hair loss hair growth thickening treatment formula serum as to be my favorite. I run some through my hair right after I wash it and make sure every stand has product. My hair feels and is visibly thicker. My hair is so much more voluminous and healthy. This is a light formula, so it&#x27;s not greasy at all. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used it for almost 2 month nothing happen about from the dandruff and eachy head scratch my head .</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and another one similar and had no problem with the other one at all. This one....OMG....the minute I put it on, it starting burning and I waited a few minutes to see if it was going to go away. My hair is not that bad and I wanted to keep what I had and did not dare to leave it on any longer. I washed it out. Does it work...I could not get past the burning. I washed it out several minutes ago and am still feeling a sensation on my scalp. Maybe it was suppose to do that,,,,but I did not want to risk it. Not for me.</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my hair.  Embarrassingly enough it&#x27;s been thinning out even though I&#x27;m only in my mid twenties.  luckily though I was able to find this product, and believe me, it works.  Not only that but it&#x27;s way more affordable then a lot of other options I looked at and easy to hide if you&#x27;re embarrassed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally quite critical with hair growing/ hair repairing products, since I don&#x27;t often see them working. However, this time around, Ultrax Labs Hair  Lush proved me wrong. It works! After a week of using it, I started feeling my hair become stronger, and few weeks later, I also see it become fuller. I definitely will recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money...i would have returned it but i missed the cutoff by 2 days!!!  as one other reviewer mentioned, pay attention to all the 4-5 star reviews and how similar each one is.... those reviewers must have been compensated for writing such reviews.... buyer beware..that&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works without making my hair look like limp noodles.  Back in the day I had great 80&#x27;s hair, but now, evidently, it is turning on me.  I wanted to see if I could make my hair look full and thick again without looking greasy and nasty.  This actually worked to do that.  Also, it smells good.  Always a plus for me.</li>
    <li> This product has been absolutely amazing for my hair. Almost immediately I noticed that my locks were thicker and fuller. And after a few weeks it was apparent that it was growing faster than normal. I can feel baby hairs starting to grow on my head as well as my current strands becoming stronger. This product also smells amazing and feels wonderful on my scalp. I would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this company. Their hair regrowth products are amazing. This serum is amazing, and I can definitely feel and see the difference in my hair. I use this with the shampoo. The shampoo is what is really helping the hair regrowth, and the serum really helps each hair feel thicker INSTANTLY! The smell is good, easy to use consistency, and RESULTS!! Who doesn&#x27;t love results!! :) If you are still on the fence about getting this item, DO IT!! You will not regret it!</li>
    <li> Just another good product from Ultra Labs. Want your hair grow back then try Ultra Labs products, just as this one, feel that thick feeling from the treatment you get of using this product first time, then after. Hair will grow, I know and can say there products die for , your hair loss treatments, this company sure knows how to put their time into their hair products, I believe they will be some day number one product on the market. I have more than this product of theirs, feel satisfied wit the results. One should be able, whether man/women see results eventually after using this product for sometime. Try Ultra Labs products before others, guarantee your fall love their products overtime.</li>
    <li> Minimize thinning hair by slowing down the process of losing hair.  I was a skeptic about the findings of caffeine stimulating hair follicle growth but as more test were done that proved it helps restore growth of hair, I stayed open-minded and faithfully used Ultrax labs hair lush serum.  Its been about two months of devotedly using Ultrax serum on top of using the Ultrax shampoo and my hair is much thicker and fuller.  I’m very pleased with the results.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I will reach out to family and friends and let them know about this product. In addition, I would strongly recommend this product to anyone. This is the fourth Ultrax product I have tried and I am totally sold on the companyâ€™s products. With Hair Lush I find that my hair looks and feels thicker, plus it is shinier and has more body than it has in years. I use it after I have shampooâ€™d and my hair is still wet - just like I would a styling get. Then, I dry it as usual. I love how quickly I saw a difference in my hair and will keeping using this product.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! I was really on the fence about it, but I bought it anyway and was pleasantly surprised! The results were quick!</li>
    <li> This serum makes my hair appear much shinier and way more healthy :)</li>
    <li> Ultrax Thickening Serum stimulates the root of your hair follicles to help activate hair growth. Because this thickening serum contains caffeine you will notice new growth and a healthier head of hair. This serum instantly gives you visibly thicker and fuller hair. This is the best hair thickening serum on the market!</li>
    <li> This Serum is incredibly effective! In just a few short days it has noticeably thickened my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave an icky build up when you use it. It&#x27;s easy to use and so helpful!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this product. It&#x27;s only been a few days but I use it after using the shampoo and conditioner everyday. Love the smell and it has my curls looking perfect! (I have loose curls) Hope it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. love the packaging!</li>
    <li> This serum has done wonders for my hair! This product is perfect for anyone with damaged hair or just wants to quicken growth in general. My hair has gotten softer,  longer and overall healthier. Great product for the price</li>
    <li> I love serums! This product has so many active ingredients. It&#x27;s easy to apply and it&#x27;s very effective! So happy!</li>
    <li> I am pleased to say this is a top-rated hair restoring product. .It is a bit expensive, but a little goes a long way. But the results are worth the expense. I began to see changes  by the second or third shampooing. It smells wonderful and my hair again has volume and sheen. I also appreciate the fact that this product does not leave a greasy build- up with daily use like many shampoo products. I am beginning to see the main ingredient, caffeine stimulates hair growth in my balding spots of my scalp. A good value for a product that is working for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with thinning hair issues for quite sometime now. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there and have spent hundreds trying to get some thickness and body back into my locks. I have noticed a tremendous difference in the overall thickness and fullness of my hair. I actually have no bald or thinning spots anymore. Most of the products that I have been using is very sticky and have caused me a lot of irritation when applied. But Hair Lush is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;build up&#x27; feeling on my scalp or hair follicles. I actually use it after I shower and my hair is still a bit damp and it dries quickly and is ready for other product application. It is definitely worth the price, and I can tell that it is going to last me a lot longer than the other products ever did. Don&#x27;t you just love it when you find the perfect hair product!</li>
    <li> It works well but I don&#x27;t think thickens my hair as good as some other products I use.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing. Ultrax Labs Hair Lush is definitely worth the cost, unlike many other products I&#x27;ve tried. Very quickly, I noticed results, with the individual hairs becoming thicker and returning to their original texture. I have very curly hair and the finer hair on the top of my head had been limp and did not blend at all calling even more attention to the hair loss. Ultax Labs Hair Lush corrected that. I&#x27;ve even noticed new hair growth and my crown and hairline. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased one and saw no results, so instead of giving up, I opted for a second order.  Neither worked!  After 60 days, I&#x27;m 100 lighter and not a single new strand to brag about.</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair already but I dye my ends often various colors and they seem to look limp so I tried this serum after trying multiple drugstore products. This serum is awesome it put life back into my hair and it makes me hair super soft and full and my ends don&#x27;t appear to be as damaged as they were just a few months ago!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found a hair treatment serum as effective as this, and I have tried pretty much everything. I am so grateful to the friend that has used it and pushed me to purchase! I have already noticed a big difference in the fullness, now having used the whole bottle up! I&#x27;m definitely ordering more, and recommend this above any other product I have used! It&#x27;s a horrible loss of self-esteem to deal with hair thinning issues, and I love Ultrax Labs Hair Lush for taking that issue away from me!</li>
    <li> This product was great I loved it! It&#x27;s very easy to apply and leaves no unwanted residue or scent. It foams up initially then quickly fades into your scalp and hair. After constant usage for several weeks you will begin to feel more body and volume to your hair. I highly recommend getting this for anyone whose hairline is starting to thin in order to maintain what you still have left.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing.  I have some thinning areas in the front edges due to wearing hats.  I did some research and decided to try the product.  I am so happy that I did.  I am so excited because I can see hair growing in the thinning areas!  I didn&#x27;t imagine it would happen so fast.  Now I am using it throughout my hair and my hair is lush, full bodied and gorgeous.  I also like that it is a leave in serum so I know it is always working not just when I wash my hair.  Thank you Ultrax Labs for giving me a gorgeous head of hair. One more thing, I have to order some for my husband because he thinks I will share mine with him, but I will not.</li>
    <li> Hair Lush is an amazing product for my thinning hair. I had almost given up until I tried this hair treatment. Not only did it leave my hair with an instant shine, it started showing immediate results. I had almost forgotten where my thinned spots were (and I had quite a few). The other thing that I greatly enjoy about this product was the fact that it is a leave-in treatment. So once I apply it, I go on with my regular styling routine. Oh and did I mention that it smells good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> My thinning locks, which were causing me quite a bit of concern, were instantly fortified by Hair Lush, Hair Thickening Treatment, an amazing product with an extraordinary blend of fabulous ingredients, including caffeine and B vitamins.  My hair literally jumped to life.  I noticed a thickness almost immediately, which made me very happy.  Non-gooey and non-sticky too.  This is also a reasonably priced product .  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not really significant hair growing</li>
    <li> L could tell no different, wasted my money on this;</li>
    <li> Great product! The price is definitely worth it as well! There is tons of more expensive products out there that do not work! I am loving the way this feels on my hair, and the way it feels on my hair. My hair is rather thin and using this as well as using their other Shampoo is really helping my hair to maintain healthy and also gain volume. I would recommend this product to anyone with thin hair or hair loss problems. 10/10</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple days on my fine, brittle hair and have seen added volume and fullness. Even though this is a leave in thickening treatment, it did not leave my hair weighed down or appearing oily. My hair also appears to be stronger in just a couple uses and smells great!</li>
    <li> While this is small in size, it packs quite a punch in quality. My hair has been thinning worse and worse for over 20 years now and six months ago I saw a photo of me from behind and my bald spot looks just terrible. So, I decided to do something about it! I&#x27;ve beenusing the Ultrax Labs Hair Lush for some time now and am glad I was able to find it on Amazon at a reduced price. You just massage it into your scalp and if you&#x27;re a little patient, you will start to see results in a few weeks. I&#x27;m seeing new sprouts of hair where I&#x27;ve been bald for years and the hair I do have is looking a lot fuller and a lot thicker now that I&#x27;ve been using this. 5-Stars for me!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this product! I have struggled with my hair being thin for the last few years now and nothing has worked. A friend of mine recommend this product to me. She used to use nioxin and eventually couldn&#x27;t afford it so when she came across Ultrax she switched! Ultrax labs hair lush is amazing. It has been over a month now and the difference is remarkable.</li>
    <li> Received order in 4 days!  Have used the product every day since receiving.  Product can be used on both wet and dry hair which I love because I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair everyday.  Usage makes this product very versatile!  Ultrax Labs Hair Lush gives your hair INSTANT thickness and volume!  Doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down or make it feel dirty.  U.L.Hair Lush was AWESOME because it did not &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; my hair.  Nice, clean fragrance, too.  Will definitely purchase again; and would recommend this product for anyone with thin, lifeless and aging hair.  A must have!!!!!</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this serum every day without fail and I am convinced it is working. My thin hair is getting thicker. I use the serum with biotin supplements plus hair thickening shampoo and conditioner. It’s my first time to use a gel hair growth product. Thought it will be messy and sticky but this product disproved it. The gel was easy to use and apply. It doesn’t drip from your fingers which is good because it doesn’t get wasted. The product came in a nice, easy to use dispenser. Anyone with fine or thin hair should try this. That is a lot to say after trying everything and not finding any good results.</li>
    <li> This product really works! I used it and almost instantly I could see a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is sure getting thicker,  what I like the most about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t  get your hair oily,  if you combine this and the champoo, which I have as well,  it&#x27;s a great combination, my hair is looking better than ever.  Just buy it!</li>
    <li> Horrible!&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are not something you want to put on your head</li>
    <li> This serum is almost too good to be true.  After only using it once I already see a remarkable difference in the texture of my hair.  It also feels and smells great.  I look forward to seeing the results as I continue to use this.  Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I must say this product was awesome. I am an african american woman who recently went natural (no more relaxers). I noticed that after dealing with alot of stress my edges were beginning to thin out. I stopped tying my hair back and went to natural products to no avail. So I ran across this product with almost no bad reviews. I wasn&#x27;t looking for my hair to appear thicker but more to jump start growth and stop hair fall... It has worked. I am 3 weeks in now and when I part my hair I can see a bunch of tiny new hair coming through. I am so thankful.</li>
    <li> The Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Growth Thickening Treatment Serum is the perfect finish to a 3-step process which includes the Ultrax Hair Surge Shampoo, along with a the Ultrax Labs Keratin Vitamin Supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it add body and fullness to those of us afflicted with thinning hair, it is highly effective as a growth stimulation treatment thickening hair with their proprietary serum.  Hair follicles actually begin to grow as the specialized treatment activates follicles for a more manageable and a worry-free look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Massaging the serum into the scalp is key, especially after shampooing.</li>
    <li> Why was my review deleted?  I hope this is not the reason why this product got such good review rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because it has the best review among all hair growth products on Amazon. I realized that I was fooled after reading all the 1 star reviews on ultrax labs&#x27; shampoo. There are more than a dozen of reviewers who have pointed out the same thing: You can&#x27;t trust the reviews of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By looking at the ingredients, this product is just an abridged version of Nioxin&#x27;s System Scalp Treatment but with a bloated price. It has strong smell people can smell it 10 feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, Caffeine won&#x27;t grow you hair. It will only make you lose more hair. Otherwise I should have a full head of hair since I consume so much coffee every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used most of one bottle of this.  I can&#x27;t say that I really see a visible difference.  I have been using it along my hairline in the front because it seems to be getting thin.  I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s not working, but I don&#x27;t see any major difference.  I realize that I many need to continue using a product like this for an extended period of time to really see benefits of it, but I don&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;ve had the kind of dramatic experience with it as some of the other reviewers.  For the price, I think I will look at some other more affordable alternatives and see how I make out.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU ULTRAX!  I have been using ultrax&#x60;s products for about 18 months now, starting with the shampoo to stop my hair from thinning. After those results  I had to trust that the thickening forumla would work. No surprise it&#x60;s works! Years of relaxing my hair left my hair limp and thin. After using this hair thickening formula it has become fuller and livelier than before!</li>
    <li> This serum is truly amazing! I use the tablets and the shampoo from the same brand and using the combination of products has been great! Even without using the other Ultrax products this serum is a great product to have because it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy to the point where it feels dirty but instead perfectly moisturizes it. What I do is massage the serum into my scalp after using the Ultra shampoo and my hair feels so smooth and nice. It is also great for styling your hair. You do not need to apply a lot just a couple of drops will do the trick and you will really notice the shine in your hair. I really feel my hair getting thicker and a lot healthier. My hair has stopped shedding so much and it is not nearly as thin as it once was. I am really in love with this serum and I know anyone else who gets it will feel the same way.</li>
    <li> I have very fine and limp hair, but this product simply changed that. Now my hair appear thicker , fuller, bouncier just like any healthy hair would look, and you can see the results instantly. I started with their shampoo and then pill and now the serum ,and I am very happy that I invested in them. Happy to have my hair back.:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the last week and found that my hair was falling out even more! I stopped using the past three days and the hair loss has stopped. Has anyone else experienced hair loss? Also, it turned my scalp red although it wasn&#x27;t itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I didn&#x27;t notice much improvement. I realize it was just a week but the other reviews read as though it was a miracle product.</li>
    <li> You can really feel and see the difference after using this, my hair is thicker and healthier than ever. I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
    <li> Treatment is awesome, my hair is growing, less breakage, so much thicker and manageable. I dont need alot each use, very concentrated formula. I recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! Some hair regenerative formulas have such a strong smell to them, not this one super mellow and didn&#x27;t bother me a bit. After only a few treatments I could tell that my hair had more body to it, it was like watching my hair thicken before my eyes. I am very impressed and very happy with this product...</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! Some products have an unbearable smell that help with hair regeneration and thickening, this one is very mellow and didn&#x27;t bother me at all. Only after a few uses I could tell my hair was getting more body and starting to thicken before my eyes! So impressed.</li>
    <li> After years of watching my hair thin out and having to deal with the personal insecurities and lack of self confidence you face when you know that you are not looking your best, I have finally found a complete beauty regime that works for me.  I started out using  Ultrax to stop my hair loss and once I accomplished that task I moved forward to the Ultrax Labs Hair lush product.  Now, my hair is no longer thinning and  it&#x27;s becoming thick and lustrous too.  Really starting to feel good about myself.</li>
    <li> Ultrax does it again! Simply put, Ultrax is the most consistent brand on the market right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each and every product I try, and buy... I LOVE! The results are progressive, quick, and so worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caffeine hair loss lines from this brand really gets my hair going. The fact that there is no stinging, it smells great, and it actually refreshes my scalp, will keep me using this product for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please try this, and don&#x27;t ever look back :)</li>
    <li> I am on my second tube, two months, not sure it works. these things run out pretty fast, lasted me less than a month each</li>
    <li> Snack oil!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Not worth the money..product works the same as the Nioxin diamix.</li>
    <li> This thing is great. I would recommend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> This product is already great by it self, but use it along with Ultrax&#x27;s shampoo &amp; conditioner and you&#x27;re golden! I was pleasantly surprised to see results after the first use! I&#x27;ve now been using it for a couple of weeks now and I&#x27;m very happy to say that my hair feels fuller and a bit longer. If you want a quality product, this is the one for you!</li>
    <li> I do not know if this works at all, no change in 3 weeks. I think that previous reviews are fake</li>
    <li> My hair is fuller and thicker then it has ever been using this product. I have looked everywhere and can&#x27;t  find anything that compares to this. I had patches of bald spots and noticed using this has helped so much. Definitely 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> This works very well. I have only used it a few times but my hair is thicker than it has ever been.&lt;br /&gt;It is quick and easy to apply and also smells good. I love that you leave it in and it doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy, oily or wear it down. My hair is so full of body and volume now!</li>
    <li> After using this serum, my hair is noticeably thicker/healthier and I have baby hairs that weren&#x27;t there before.  People who know how my hair was before even comment on the difference, without me telling them that I&#x27;m using a hair growth product.  I can even comb/brush my hair without losing a ball of hair each time.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday and it doesn&#x27;t  make my hair oily or flaky, or any of that other nasty build up.  Just a tiny bit on your fingers massaged in the scalp is enough and will make the bottle last longer, you&#x27;ll  know it&#x27;s working when you feel that tingly sensation.  It also smells really good. Everyone with thinning hair should give this a try.</li>
    <li> Hair Lush by Ultrax labs is definitely a miracle serum!  For a product that is seemingly very lightweight, it has a very tough consistency &amp; makes a pretty dramatic difference in the volume of your hair.  Considering the kind of work it does on your scalp it does not leave sticky build up or cause scalp irritation.  It is vital to follow the instructions on this for the best results.  When applying, massage into the scalp for a couple of minutes.  Use after regular shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a recommendation from my brother who has been experiencing great results with hair fullness.  I am now using this product and seeing the same results.  I very much think the product is contributing to making my hair fuller. This product also makes my hair pretty soft. Great product, would recommend. Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> The Hair Lush formula is definitely working! I was a bit skeptical at first, but I figured it was at least worth a try with so many positive reviews of the product.  After about a week or so of twice-a-day use, I can definitely notice, and feel, a significant difference.  The thin spots on my head are less noticeable, my hair has more volume overall, and it shines more and feels healthier to the touch.  I also noticed less dandruff since I started using Hair Lush, which I think has something to do with the minty, cool feeling on your scalp when you use Ultrax Labs products.  I&#x27;ve been using a small amount of Hair Lush after my morning shower, and then again when I get home from work for the past week, and I am pleasantly surprised at the results.  I&#x27;m not expecting to start re-growing hair, but I am definitely pleased with the increased &amp;#34;coverage&amp;#34; so to speak of the thin spots on my head -- and I like to keep my hair short, which used to draw unwanted attention to thin spots.  The formula is non-greasy which is great, and rubs in well -- the only thing I&#x27;d like to see is a bigger bottle, because I am going through the bottle quickly (but maybe I don&#x27;t need to be applying it twice a day).  Definitely worth a try if you want increased volume and coverage of thin spots</li>
    <li> Apply after washing your hair. It really adds volume. My hair is fuller and thicker. There is no more breakage. I recommend this product to anyone experiencing thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great exclamation point to my hair growth/strengthening regimen on top of the SHAMPOO -  http://www.amazon.com/Ultrax-Caffeine-Growth-Stimulating-Shampoo/dp/B007SZCG0C/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?m&#x3D;AX94L0SLJXDHN&amp;s&#x3D;merchant-items&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1422397948&amp;sr&#x3D;1-4&lt;br /&gt;With a higher concentration of the same active ingredients (delivered via breakthrough innovation technology) thicker and stronger hair can be noticed almost immediately.  Many who purchased this product have even mentioned new hair growth!&lt;br /&gt;An added (and very important) plus is that this serum leaves no residue on the scalp.  The non-oily formula leaves a fresh, clean and overall healthy feeling.  So even if you don’t wash your hair everyday, there should be no build up from this product that can leave your hair feeling heavy and cause your scalp to flake and feel irritated.</li>
    <li> Definitely seeing results! The formula is light and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky. Great product for hair thickening would recommend!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Noticed no difference. My hair loss is from a combination of age and corticosteroid use. My type of hair loss won&#x27;t apply to everyone, but if you are experiencing hair loss from these conditions you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Ultrax Labs Hair Shampoo and have been seeing improvement. Now with this thickening treatment formula serum product combined is making my hair a lot thicker and fuller, not to mention soft too! I am so glad I came across these products. Will highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use it in conjunction with Vitamin Shampoo so not sure which product is working but I do think I see some hair growth.</li>
    <li> I believe that this serum perfectly rounds out the benefits when used with their shampoo and supplement.  This is a product that can be used regularly because it’s a very light and smooth serum with a silky texture.  It’s not in any way overly oily, waxy or greasy. That alone is a definite plus because I have low porosity hair and it’s very prone to product build up. You just have to make sure that like with any other serum, you don’t use too much. After using this for several days, applying lightly and focusing on the areas that are a bit sparser than others, I have experienced no issues with product build up, especially since I only use very light, natural, clean rinsing products in my hair in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that it does give the appearance of thicker, fuller hair, especially in areas that tend to thin such as edges and temples.  The visible difference is almost instant, and is a fantastic product to use for “instant gratification” while some of the compounds in the serum and the ingredients in their other products have an opportunity to work. This serum can also give new life to over processed hair that’s been compromised due to chemicals, heat or bleach. My hair is ombred, and sometimes I put a tiny amount on my ends.  Having fine hair, I&#x27;m prone to flyaways, but this serum has given me a little extra control without weighing my hair down too much.  Overall, my hair looks thicker, bouncier and just healthier near my scalp and on my ends. Looking forward to seeing the effects in the months to come!</li>
    <li> Zero would be a good rating for this. It is full of alcohol and I don&#x27;t think alcohol is good for your hair.  Did nothing for me.  Sent it back.  I think a lot of these reviews are fake or something.  Do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed.  I tend to nerd out on new hair products, and if I find products that I like, I will literally run through their entire line trying everything until I&#x27;m disappointed.  Case-and-point: Hair Lush.  Two words: HELL YES!  This product gives my hair life ... literally.  For a while there, my hair was damaged from coloring and was dry from the weather.  It felt like it would never grow, and when it did, it became damaged so easily.  Then, I found this, and I&#x27;ll never touch my hair with another serum (unless Ultrax goes out of business, which I doubt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple weeks of using this, I felt a huge difference in my hair - it was softer, thicker, and stronger.  After  about a month, I noticed obvious growth that was super healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m a fan of this product.</li>
    <li> The Ultrax Labs Hair Brand is definitely one of best brands for hair products I&#x27;ve ever used. I haven&#x27;t tried this specific thickening treatment, but after seeing the results from the ultrax Lab Shampoo, I&#x27;m sure it will not disappoint. After a week of using this brand of shampoo my hair loss in the shower dropped dramatically. i definitely recommend this brand of hair product to anyone dealing with hair loss or thinning hair problems.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Ultrax Labs has many fantastic hair-loss products, but this is definitely my favorite. It leaves my hair smelling great and feeling great and it even gives a little boost of energy since there is caffeine in it. I have already noticed a significant improvement in the thickness of my hair. I will absolutely continue to buy and use this product and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> Make sure to have patience. These products do not work over night, but have working results. All you need is to use a little bit during each treatment and you&#x27;ll be fine. Hair will be stimulated and continue to thicken during use. I started using this product with the shampoo and found it to work nicely. It also has a decent smell to it, which is unusual with these types of products. Also leaves your hair shiny(added bonus!)</li>
</ol>
