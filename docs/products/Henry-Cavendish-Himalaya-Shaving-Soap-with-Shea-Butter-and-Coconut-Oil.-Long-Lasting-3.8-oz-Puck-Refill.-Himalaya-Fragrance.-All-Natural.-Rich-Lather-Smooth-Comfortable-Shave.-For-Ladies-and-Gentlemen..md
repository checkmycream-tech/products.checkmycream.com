<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Soap works great - thank you!</li>
    <li> This soap smells great and makes your skin extremely soft after use.</li>
    <li> I was impressed by the overwhelming favorable reviews. The vendor must have a large family. I was not impressed by the product as I have been using it for about a week. To put in one one word &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I must have tried about 50 soaps, creams, oils, sticks and what have you. To me soaps are traditionally difficult to generate a decent lather,. Either you use too much water retained in the brush and it comes up thin and foamy or you use not enough and it doesn&#x27;t lather. I&#x27;ve tried several soap bars and this ain&#x27;t one of the best. To that I nominate Mitchells Wool Fat soap - still my favorite soap bar. This one is quite average and difficult to lather. Its lubrication and glide are good but not great.&lt;br /&gt;In general I prefer the creams in a tube or in a tub. Much easier to lather and do a better job IMHO I. like the Cella in a tub and the Art of Shaving tubes. My numero uno remains Kiss My Face - Lime. To me the best shaving product ever invented for lathering, application, glide, lubrication, closeness and how it leaves your face. I like Lime you may not, there are many other scents.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would rate this one with the cheaper soaps such as Van Derhagen and Col (somebody) and all those handmade &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; soaps. Once a company touts it &amp;#34;naturalness&amp;#34; and it being free of this and free of that my consumer antenna goes up. Its almost like they&#x27;re diverting attention from what it is supposed to do. Vendor is somewhat dishonest as far as I am concerned. She offers a coupon but it never works. Back and forth and it never worked.You made your profit on me this time but never again.</li>
    <li> Nice lather and nice fragrance.  Very happy with this shaving soap and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Very smooth. The first time I used this shaving soap... I had to double check as I thought I must have put a new blade in my razor.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Lathers up great giving a close comfortable shave leaving your skin feeling smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> The shaving soap has some getting used to, again it is a personal thing, but that being said once you get the lather down to what you like, it really feels very good.  My face is quite smooth after using this soap, and feels just fine, no nicks, no blood...just great stuff.!! I will be buying it again for sure..</li>
    <li> Smooth and easy on the skin when I shave. I used to use those triple or quad blades but they just irritated my skin bad. Went to an old fashioned single safety blade and used the same shaving cream from a can, which did not help with irritation&lt;br /&gt;With this product it&#x27;s smoother and easy on the skin with a tight and close shave..</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant because this brand didn&#x27;t come up much on searches for &amp;#34;best shave soaps&amp;#34; but natural ingredients and a good lather were very important to me in choosing a shaving soap and this was one of the few that used shea butter too so I figured it would be smooth. And HOLY S**T was I happy i did. Exceeded my expectation, whipped up a lather in under a minute and felt great. I would still recommend using a pre-shave oil, but I&#x27;m very happy with this soap. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am a newly starting wet shaver and this soap whips up effortlessy into a rich, pleasant and long lasting lather.</li>
    <li> One of the best and best value shaving soaps I&#x27;ve used. I wet shave and the razor literally glides effortlessly over bumps and edges without any unintended nicks or cuts. Plus, I sometimes mix it with shaving cream and lather together with the brush. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product. Very smooth shave. Lather moisturizes face as it softens bristles.  As well as using myself give the product as Christmas presents for my sons.</li>
    <li> Very good soap, works well it has a pleasant smell</li>
    <li> This shave soap works good. It has a nice light scent and good lather. It left my face feeling soft and moisturized. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> great deal works as advertised</li>
    <li> An excellent shave cream, but pretty pricey by volume.</li>
    <li> Great shaving soap! Smells darn good too&#x3D;) I use a lot of this stuff cause....well....I&#x27;m female and have many areas to shave!! The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t fit my shaving mug real well and tends to rattle around when I lather up my brush.</li>
    <li> My husband enjoyed using it but the lather wasn&#x27;t as good as some other soaps out there and he wasn&#x27;t crazy about the fragrance.  Taylor of Bond Street and Proraso are still his favorites.</li>
    <li> Great product shaves well and smells great also made in USA what more could you ask for.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product.  It possesses everything needed to give me that barbershop close shave that I seek. The ingredients are safe and satisfying , leaving my skin smooth and healthy. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Makes a decent lather, smells pretty good.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used it I could tell a huge difference from the cream I had been using before.  Areas on my neck that usually got agitated were fine.  Zero nicks.  I was so happy I made another pass against the grain, and the result was the best shave of my life!</li>
    <li> This one smells very nice.He like it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful. It&#x27;s smell is faint but nice, which works great for my boyfriend who is sensitive to strong odors. It lathers great, and he gets a clean smooth shave which practically cured his razor burn issues. If it&#x27;s relevant he used a boar bristle shaving brush to lather with.</li>
    <li> Great product. It does everything a shaving soap should do. a wonderful scent also.</li>
    <li> Ordered 1 cake of this soap, and just finished it.  It lasted 4 months, 1 shave per day.  Here are my 2 cents worth:  PRICE:  A bit steep.  FRAGRANCE:  Vaguely soapy.  LATHER:  Works up easily but dries too quickly.  SHAVE:  Not that good, especially on neck.  Required 2 or 3 passes to get everything.  OVERALL:  Average soap, priced too high.</li>
    <li> I have used this product and love it.</li>
    <li> Great soap, smoother shave and nice smell</li>
    <li> Very good soap to use when shaving.  I normally use TOBS creams and decided to try a soap.  It lathers up really well with a small amount of water.  The Shea Butter leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft after shaving with very little irritation.  I highly recommend this soap if you&#x27;re looking for a good shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Everything worked great</li>
    <li> Good dense lather that last through the whole shave. Smell is neutral.</li>
    <li> I Love it! The Best Shave I have ever had. Incredible soapy lather. A must have for an awesome shave!</li>
    <li> Excellent natural shaving soap. It makes every shave much more enjoyable knowing that I&#x27;ll come through looking, smelling, and feeling clean without all the additives :)</li>
    <li> *Pics are with a dish purchased separately &amp; after several uses.*  I ordered this for the father of my children because he needed a replacement for his old kit. He really liked it last time and this time. The company has sent me an email after my purchase to give me tips on how to use the product and they even included a promotion code for 20% off my next purchase. Wow! Great product and an Amazing company!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and will last a long time. I am almost 8 months in and it is about halfway done. I shave about every other day.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaving soap. I am relatively new to wet shaving so have been experimenting with a number of these shaving soaps and creams. This is one of the good ones. I like a rich thick lather and need to make a couple of passes. This provides an excellent lather and the blade glides over it. If you care about aroma, I can&#x27;t help you much. I don&#x27;t have a very sensitive nose and frankly don&#x27;t detect any aroma. That is fine. I want it to give me a good shave and it does. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product. It appears to perform as advertised. Great lather for those of us preferring a wet shave.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. You should consider offering a shaving soap cup to offer with it as an add on. We just happened to have the perfect size ceramic dish. Also, consider recommending quality shaving brushes and brush holders as well.</li>
    <li> Using this with my cut-throat blade and my shaves have been great.&lt;br /&gt;Little or no scent !&lt;br /&gt;Goes on easy with my brush&lt;br /&gt;No mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great clean shave thats fantastic for my skin...no roughness or hassle.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product a few months back and wanted a  few shaves to test it !&lt;br /&gt;10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will purchase this again when the time comes</li>
    <li> Works great but It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my skin.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a comfortable, smooth shave I would highly recommend Henry&#x27;s mug soap.  I have not tried the puck but if it&#x27;s anything like the soap you can&#x27;t go wrong; I give it *****!</li>
    <li> Great soap.  I love the smell, and it formed lather quickly.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many shaving soaps. I had low expectations since my real motivation was to try a natural one. I was amazed how great this brand feels. I will buy it now because it is the best, not just because it is chemical free.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Tons of lather. No silly ingredients. Forget Proraso.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband who likes to shave the old fashion way.With a double edged razor and shaving soap as to can shaving cream . Well this product gets high praise from him he loves it , he has tried many different shaving soaps and by far he says this is truly the best he has ever tried . Now to be his absolutely and only soap he will use from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving soap easily creates rich lather: it lubricates the razor for a slick glide over your face, for a cushioned and comfortable shave. Lather is long lasting unlike many shaving cream, foams and gels which dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the  addition of Shea Butter it  leaves your  skin feeling smooth and nicely moisturized, not oily like a lot of other products . It won&#x27;t dry or irritate your skin like many shaving soaps, shaving creams and gels do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is larger in size than average mug shave soaps it will last you about an average of 3 - 6 months.It has a minimal light scent almost none which is fresh without being artificial. This is an all natural shaving soap which I&#x27;m sure is pleasing to all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will receive in this product  a 3.8 oz puck of shaving soap and an added bonus of 5 double edged razor blades.This is quite a value for your money . My husband and I highly recommend this product for all your shaving needs .</li>
    <li> I gave this soap to my husband for father&#x27;s day. He said he liked it alot, was a great buy and would reccomend to any man who shaves with the old fashion brush &amp; mug sets.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my husband and he loves it.  The lather is great, but the smell is what I like.  It&#x27;s very mild, and there is no artificial perfume-y odor.  I also really like that the seller sent an email with tips for use.  I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Have used the shaving soap twice (I have a beard and only shave 2-3 times a week). Have been using shaving soaps for years and this one is one of, if not the best. Very close and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I like to shave in the shower so the soap bar style works great for me (don&#x27;t bother with a brush, just lather the bar up on your stubble). I found this shaving soap supplied a particularly nice layer of lubricant protection to my skin while shaving and then rinsed off easily and fully. I found this surprising as I assumed it would be difficult to rinse off like so many other oil-based products. Afterwards my skin feels smooth and moisturized but not oily. A superior product overall, and one that I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a girl and I just started using this for my legs, it makes them notably smoother and I don&#x27;t get red bumps when I shave anymore. Plus there&#x27;s so much lather! :D</li>
    <li> Super great shave soap! One of the best my husband has tried! Lathers nicely &amp; not too fragrant.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy shaving with this soap.  It lathers well, maintains foaminess during my shave and moisturizes my skin. I also find the smell mild and pleasant. I would not pay the full $21.95 for this, but I bought it for 13.50 on sale and it was well worth it for that price. If you can get this on sale, I would recommend definitely give it, but wouldn&#x27;t pay much more than $14.</li>
    <li> Good product. Just started wet shaving, and i don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but is working great.</li>
    <li> Big fan!  Was looking to turn the daily routine of shaving into more of an experience and something I can enyoy, and this soap is an essential part of that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous shave soaps and this one by far is my favorite. The scent is light and it lathers very well once you find that happy medium. But what keeps this as my go to soap is the fact it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like a few of my other soaps do. If I do a second lather, it doesn&#x27;t make my face all itchy. Would recommend if you have sensitive skin and other soaps irritate it.</li>
    <li> Good but not GREAT.  Follow the instructions and get a smooth , comfortable, shave!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving soap for my husband, and although it takes a few days using it his skin looks clearer and smoother. The smell is very nice. We both are using it and we are very pleased.  The skin feels really nice.  I used it for my legs and the Shea butter leave the skin very soft.  I received this Shaving Shea Butter and Coconut soap in exchange of an honest and sincere review . If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative for your skin this soap will convince you by its softness.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and the hints for better shaving are useful.</li>
    <li> Iove it. Great lather. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Makes shaving fun and leaves my face feeling great!</li>
    <li> Shea butter has a wonderfully mild scent and works wonders on my face. No irritation after shaving.</li>
    <li> this soap lathered very nicely.</li>
    <li> Note: items I purchased were for a gift for my brother in law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to gift these to him but I would like to inform all of you potential buyers out there of the excellent customer service I received from this seller. I truly felt like my purchase mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per my sister, my brother in law loves these products &amp; he&#x27;s very picky about products he uses in his face.. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase as gifts again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple times so far since receiving it, but my skin seems to approve as it&#x27;s not dry anymore. The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming either, but still pleasant.</li>
    <li> Love the shaving soap and bowl. What impressed me the most was a tutorial on the best way to lather the brush. What a difference to what I was doing. Thanks for the follow up advice and the discount coupon. You guys rock!</li>
    <li> The y shipped fast and the product is of great quality</li>
    <li> This soap lathers well, lubricates my skin and makes shaving very smooth.</li>
    <li> Whether you buy this to use for yourself, or as a gift for someone else, you&#x27;re going to love the packaging.  It&#x27;s just very classy, elegant and beautiful.  I got a great deal on this shaving soap, and I took it to a local retailer, The Art of Shaving.  I let them do their demo on me with their soap, and then I pulled out my Henry Cavendish Soap and told them I&#x27;d like the same demo.  Let me tell you, they were amazed at the quality of this product.  It&#x27;s right around $14 here on Amazon and the soap they wanted to sell me, one I didn&#x27;t like as much as this one, was $30, plus tax, PLUS I had to drag myself to the mall.  LOVE AMAZON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Henry Cavendish will come out with a nice soap holder next, as I want to be first in line to buy that.  Thanks for a great product and for introducing me to a whole new world of shaving.</li>
    <li> I received my Henry Cavendish soap yesterday and shaved with it this morning using my Merkur 34c and an Astra blade... it was a WONDERFUL shave! Super slick during the shave and ultra smooth afterward. I am looking forward to tomorrow morning!</li>
    <li> Great soap.  Lathers great, subtle fragrance.  I already bought a back up...</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful! Lathers great, and great moisturizer.  Will order again!</li>
    <li> Upon delivery, I was really impressed with the packaging, it felt like a premium product. I was also impressed in that I could tell that it was indeed 100% natural (which I am very particular about these days due to the horrific toxins in most other products out there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathered nicely and made shaving really easy and quick compared to the soap I was using before. I highly recommend this product for not only a close, easy shave, but for the health benefits of an natural soap!</li>
    <li> One of the best shaving soaps I&#x27;ve ever used. I absolutely love it, and the customer service is awesome. They really do go above and beyond to insure you are happy with your purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Rich lather&lt;br /&gt;- All natural&lt;br /&gt;- free razor blade&lt;br /&gt;- Great light scent. Not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;- Great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;- perfect size puck.</li>
    <li> works great, smooth lather, doesn&#x27;t dry skin</li>
    <li> Excellent for my skin and gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend.  He has very sensitive skin and usually does not like to use any products on his face as most make him break out or irritate his skin.  So far it&#x27;s been easy on his skin and has had no irritation or breakouts.  It also smells great!  I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I just started wet shaving so this is the first shave soap I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It&#x27;s easy to lather up ( even for a beginner like me) and smells great.  I love this product and plan on ordering it again when I run out</li>
    <li> Good soap!  I had a wooden shaving bowl given to me by my darling bride a number of years ago, and five minutes in a double boiler rendered this puck ready to pour into it - now it&#x27;s filled to the brim and ready for another year of smooth shaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service too, I didn&#x27;t have any issues with my order but their followup emails were polite, friendly, and not obnoxious ;-)</li>
    <li> Lots of soap with a pleasant odor and good foam.  It makes for a good shave.</li>
    <li> My son who is 18 hates shaving cream. Since he has started using the shaving soap he says he gets a much cleaner and closer shave. He also never has the dry skin after. He loves this product. When my son is happy, this mom is happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave soap. Thick lather, nice smell. Good soap!</li>
    <li> Not as drying out as Porrasso Bali blades from Japan not so good</li>
    <li> I shave every other day I don&#x27;t just shave my face also I shave my head this is thebest whether I have ever had the shave is so smooth and so close and so tight it&#x27;s unbelievable it&#x27;s a comfortable shave no burning I&#x27;ll either up twice shave twice with a single blade razor lot better than buying expensive razors I will definitely be buying this shaving soap again thank you very much for your great product</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and leaves skin feeling smooth</li>
    <li> I purchased this shave cream for my husband and he is a huge fan. Just after two days he experienced healthier skin tone. The shave cream acts as a moisturizer as well and he hasn&#x27;t had to use aftershave to quell any razor burn. Simply Natural sent us 5 free blades which my husband enjoys using as well. So both products from Simply Natiral are better than the Taylor of Bond Street shave cream and Feather razors he was using before using the Henry Cavendish. Great product keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the quantity of lather and the smooth frictionless shave, especially on my neck which is quite sensitive.  Have shaved with both new and slightly used double edge razor blades with similar results.  Lather did not dry out!  Fragrance with nice and very subtle, as noted in other reviews.  I also purchased a Colonel Conk soap disk at the same time, but trashed it after 3 shaves.  Looking forward to trying other Henry Cavendish Shave Soap products.  I have used Art of Shaving products for 1 years and found the Cavendish soap to be comparable at roughly 1/2 the price.</li>
    <li> Purchase this for my  husband.  He loves it.  He tends to get rashes when he shaves but this worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Solid soap with decent lather, mild scent and very effective for moisturizing dry skin.</li>
    <li> The lather is so rich in moisture I stopped using preshave oil which was an inconceivable idea with the shaving soap I used before purchasing this one.  Also, since I rarely feel the need to use aftershave moisturizer after I use my alum bar it&#x27;s all one needs to know how delicate and moisturizing this shaving soap is.  I&#x27;m laughing because I purchased this w/two other soaps and have 0 inclination to use them even though they were much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;The hockey puck size bar was thick and generous size.  I sliced it into two so it would fit my dish.  Best part, it&#x27;s all natural so you&#x27;re minimizing daily exposure to God knows what is in other soaps. This one&#x27;s a keeper</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in exchange for a review. It&#x27;s incredible. This is the first time ny husband has used a shaving soap and he is very impressed. It lathers so nicely and he gets the best shave he has ever had. It also leaves his skin feeling amazing. It is a very large product as well so it will last a while.</li>
    <li> This is  really good stuff. I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of shave soap and this may be the best. Maybe it is the shea butter that makes it lubricate so well. Nice hard-to-define fragrance.</li>
    <li> makes for a smooth face</li>
    <li> Great smelling.  Lather is really rich.  Lasts for a long, long time.  I&#x27;ve used 4 or 5 brands of shaving soap and this is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff. I use the old double-edge blades and lather up with this. Absolutely fab, if I say so!</li>
    <li> I just started using the soap.  Unfortunately, it is thicker than my wooden soap bowl so  I can&#x27;t close the top of the bowl with the soap inside. However, the soap itself is excellent.  It lathers quickly with warm/hot water; and it smells great.</li>
    <li> I am looking forward to  using this shave soap again I was finaley able to find it and  it was easy to order and a great price for a excalent product.</li>
    <li> Great soap! I get a nice, full lather with this product. The scent is pleasing and not overpowering. I will definitely use this again.</li>
    <li> Great lather!&lt;br /&gt;Best yet and I have tried 3 other brands of the most popular shaving soaps and this is the best thus far.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a birthday gift, along with razor and other items for shaving. He loved it.</li>
    <li> Great price, good blades.</li>
    <li> I am again learning how to shave with a &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34;  I wanted to make sure that I had quality/value products to insure a safe experience. I wrote a response on amazon.com. Guess the seller was paying attention to it. The seller responded to my feedback with some very good tips to help insure it a would result in &#x27;that&#x27; better experience. This is one of those quality products and the seller is a quality seller too...</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The shave soap works well and feels &amp; smells terrific on the skin.</li>
    <li> This shaving doap is truly wonderful!  The aroma, lather and lubrication on my face is unlike any other shaving soap I ever used.  Do yourself a favor and try this product. Your face will thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, It is more like a Shaving Cream. Great lather that last and great protection to the Skin. &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Works well with all razors. It has a nice smooth feeling on your skin with the right amount of glide. Smells great with out being overpowering . With no nasty chemicals,whats not to like.........</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving soap - much better than foams and gels found at the drug store.  Very nice lather, and leavings face feeling smooth and moistened.</li>
    <li> I tried this as the first soap I have used and I didn&#x27;t like it at first as my skin was very dry afterwards and I was getting razor burn easy. But after a few days this soap works well. My synthetic bristle brush does not lather this really thick but it works ok. It is more of a slightly thicker soap suds but maybe that is the way this type of shaving is. The smell is not too strong and my skin is not dried out. I will buy more of this but I may also see what else is out there. Please keep in mind we have an iron filter and a water softener to remove the limestone we put in. Our hardness is 3.5 before the softener does its job so I do not think the hardness is a problem.</li>
    <li> I have been DE shaving for 4 years now, and this is one of the best soaps I have found.  At first I was disappointed in the lack of smell, and I put this bar aside in the drawer without trying it.  One of my other soaps finally finished, so I melted this one into my shaving bowl and added a few drops of sandlewood essential oil to give it some smell.  Wow, lathers super thick, shaves super smooth, and I feel bad for not using it sooner.  Very moisturizing.  Definately a keeper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving with soap and safety razor and this is only the third soap I have used but this product is great.  Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin and helps the razor glide better than any other soap I have tried.  Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Went from regular shaving cream to this shaving soap with a shaving brush. There&#x27;s no comparison. I get much closer and better coverage with this soap than I ever did with shaving cream. Lathers up well and it&#x27;s easy to brush on. It&#x27;s a thick bar of soap that will last a long time, but I&#x27;m sure to purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap was even better than I had expected!!&lt;br /&gt;and It arrived within a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> I loved the shave. Best feeling of my skin ever! I would recommend this product to everyone and anyone.The shipping was very&lt;br /&gt;satisfactory and the best shave ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;Bob H</li>
    <li> Perfect for me.  I have soft, oily skin and a tough beard that grows fast.  A little hot water on my badger brush and I can quickly build up a thick lather.  Goes on easily.  I shave with and without a pre-shave oil; works almost as good without oil as it does with oil.  Mild, barely there fragrance.  Badger brush cleans easily with just hot water after lathering.  Oh, and I am using a brand name 5 blade cartridge razor.  With this lather, that razor works great.  Tried the Proraso products that everyone else raves about.  Meh, not so much for me.  Lather is too thin.  I find the odor of the pre-shave and the shaving lather unpleasant and medicinal.  Razor always pulls and tugs when I use the Proraso.  Proraso doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate my beard type.  Proraso doesn&#x27;t work with my brand name 5 blade cartridge razor.</li>
    <li> It seems to dry out too fast on the face and is somewhat irritating. I had a great shave the day before using this and would like to go back a day and not use it. But it does have a good smell to it. So it&#x27;s not all that bad.</li>
    <li> Very nice shave soap.  Good, sustained lather and understated scent. Good value.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time. The lather is very rich. I use a micro blade shaver, not a straight razor, and it worked great! It didn’t dry my skin out like other shave soaps I have tried. I would totally recommend this product to guys who like to wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;Jimmy H.</li>
    <li> This smell so good!  It is a very light but clean smell, not overpowering like most of the other shaving soaps I have smelled.  The shaving soap with shea butter and coconut oil is very smooth.  I noticed that as soon as I opened the package. It lathers well, and rinsing clean easy . I plan on giving this to my friend who collects antique shaving mugs.  A little extra about this soap-it is in a very nice package ready for gift giving. It is a quality product and I think any gentleman would love to have this.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at reduced price in return for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> With a brush full of hot water and presto wonderfully fragrant and dense moisturizing shaving experience no cuts at all no grinding or scraping great soap and I would buy it again I wish it would come in sandelwood also!</li>
    <li> Outstanding shaving soap!  Mild on the skin, plenty of lather and nicely lubricates your shave.  I&#x27;ve used other more expensive soaps that quickly evaporate so that you are virtually dry shaving.  Not so here.  Also, the puck is considerably thicker than most other brands, but it&#x27;s easy to cut in half if you need it to fit into a smaller shaving bowl.  I was so impressed with the product that I sent an order to my son at college who also uses a double edge razor.  Just buy it and try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Excellent service and follow up from the seller, &amp;#34;Loretta Green LLC&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This soap is an excellent  product.  It is easy to get lots of lather and my razor glides over my face without any nicks or razor burn.  This is now my first choice when I reach for my soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shave soap a couple times now since it was delivered. It lathers ok. Not the thick lather I like and what I get from other shave soaps but it&#x27;s a pretty decent lather. The smell itself if really good and doesn&#x27;t linger very long which I like. The slickness of the soap is also decent but not as good as some of my other soaps.</li>
    <li> I found the this  product years ago on a visit to London, now that I have  rediscovered it and won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this shave soap or this company. Before I even used the soap, I got two emails and two phone calls asking me to review the product. Who calls you and asks for reviews? The whole thing felt sleazy to me and makes me question the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having now used the soap, it&#x27;s average at best. Nothing special about it. An ok lather on the first pass, but doesn&#x27;t hold up on the second pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very strong scented. My wife came home and literally asked why I smelled like perfume. This was a few hours after shaving. Not a total waste though — she&#x27;s happy to use it as a shower soap.</li>
    <li> I am new to this type of shaving soap. I like the smell and texture&#x27;s seams to have good quality&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I have been using a shaving mug and soap for about 25-30 years. Last I&lt;br /&gt;used a &#x27;cheap&#x27; soap I picked up locally. This morning was my first shave&lt;br /&gt;with this soap. It lathered up so much better than all the other soaps I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;used in all my years. It was, indeed, a pleasure. I was contacted by the&lt;br /&gt;co-founder with some tips prior to its arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful product. Wonderful customer service. Fast &#x27;turn around&lt;br /&gt;time&#x27;, and packaged well and appropriately (not a huge box or extraneous&lt;br /&gt;padding).&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 I would purchase again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  It has a gentle scent and lathers perfectly.  I highly recommend this shaving soap! The seller has had excellent customer service and I will definitely be purchasing from them again.</li>
    <li> I recently switched over to using safety razors vs Mach 3 razors and loved it.  This shaving soap is the only soap I have bought so far with my new shaving method so I don&#x27;t have very much experience with other brands but this brand is working very nicely for me.  Follow the directions and put some hot water with the soap brush for a minute, then discard.  I run hot water over the shaving brush, then squeeze it out.  You don&#x27;t want the shaving brush to be overly wet when you squirl it in the shaving mug or you won&#x27;t get a thick enough soap mix.&lt;br /&gt;I may try other brands to compare to this one later, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Although I like the product. I don&#x27;t feel the price is warranted. But then, that&#x27;s just my opinion. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I have only been using soap and a brush for a short time. I&#x27;ll never go back to a can. However, this has been my favorite soap so far. Try it, it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving and have been trying to find those very special, essential products that make my DE shaving experience not only great but unique to me. I have tried a few different soaps and razors, I have have nothing but a good experience since I made the change to wet DE shaving. I love it, my face has never felt better and shaving is actually fun now, almost my zen time of the day now. That being said, I was happy before, since I added this soap to my regime I am ecstatic. I love this soap, I have found my go to soap now along with a DE blade I love as well. Henry Cavendish paired with a Gillette silver blue was the best shave I have ever had in my entire life. This soap not only has a very light pleasant smell but it lathers up fairly quickly and is nice and creamy and leaves my face nice and slick for the razor to just glide over my face. I have a very thick beard to and this soap lifted the hairs and just made it a pleasant experience. Also, my face has never felt so moisturized and soft after a shave. I am very happy with this product and will be purchasing more in the future. I just hope you keep selling this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> My husband used it the same day it came in and said its a great product. It left his face feeling super soft and smooth with no irritations whatsoever. He loves his new soap.</li>
    <li> Love the soap. Lathers really well</li>
    <li> Good soap, lathers nicely and smells pleasant.  The razor blades are a nice bonus and are good blades.  If you like shaving &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; with a safety razor, this will help you get the job done.</li>
    <li> I have to say, there is a wide array of quality when it comes to shaving soaps. I have been using them for some 15 years now, and I have to say this is one of the best. It holds a lather on my face for a long time and is nice and slippery for my razor. I have just switched to a metal safety razor, which requires much more focus while shaving. This shaving soap is making the learning curve much smoother for a safety razor newbie. The scent is a little light, but it won&#x27;t conflict with anything else I put on so I guess that can be a good thing. I will order this soap again.</li>
    <li> Tired of taking shaving cream when I travel so this works great. Got a small plastic container and no need to take it out of my bag at security.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly as advertised. This is my first foray into shave soap.</li>
    <li> Very light scent and very slick for a close and comfortable shave. Leaves my face feeling great and I&#x27;ve noticed less irritation. Give it a try!!!</li>
    <li> Although I have only used two other brands of shaving soap in the past, this is my new favorite and I am very pleased with it.  It lathers quickly and easily, and has very little scent.  It does not irritate my skin and as with most good shaving soaps, makes for a better, cleaner shave and does not dry the skin as much as ordinary shaving cream.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful Shaving Soap with Shea Butter.  I use this every morning before i shave and it really helps to reduce my shaving bumps. It feels and looks great. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the soap. It&#x27;s larger than most soaps and the price was great and it was shipped out the day I ordered</li>
    <li> Great product. Lathers nicely and love the scent.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get what the bad reviews are saying--his stuff lathers up great with my badger shaving brush.  Smells great and I love that the ingredients are paraben free.  The only downside for me is that my shaving cup is too big for this puck, so the soap just flops around as I swirl the brush. I&#x27;ll live.  *** UPDATE: Still loving this shaving soap.  They say to melt the puck to fit the shaving mug using a microwave.  Well, my shaving mug is stainless steel, so not the best idea.    SOLUTION: I just boil about 2 inches of water in a pot. After it boils, I turn it to a low simmer and put the mug (with soap) into the water. The puck melts in a few minutes (it doesn&#x27;t have to fully melt, just reach the edges of the mug).  Pull out of the water (using tongs or a glove) and let cool to solidify the soap again. Done!</li>
    <li> Lathers well and the ladies seem to like it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. My first time buying, but not the last. It smells great, lathered up great and softens my skin. I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> Keeps your face lubricated allowing the blade to smoothly glide across your skin. I usually apply a preshave cream when using other soaps to avoid razor burn but have noticed I can skip that step now. Highly recommened</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Moisturizing, and scent is nice but not too strong. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Rating shaving soap is, of course, a highly subjective endeavor, but for my purposes, this is the stuff.  I have a relatively coarse beard and sensitive skin, so it can be difficult to chop through without some irritation, but this soap seems to hit the mark.  That it&#x27;s all natural is a major bonus.  (For reference:  I use this with a double-edge razor, have not tried it with a straight, and can&#x27;t stand cartridges.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to a shaving creams that really dry out your skin afterwards or take a while to fully rinse off. This was very easy to use and rinsed right off, and left my skin smooth with no dryness. I am part Italian and have very dark, thick facial hair so I have to use a razor in different directions on my face to get a clean shave. Sometimes this leaves small cuts. But no cuts with this! Highly recommend, great product!</li>
    <li> I have a &amp;#34;baby face&amp;#34; if you may even if I am 50 years old.  lol  I&#x27;m always looking for products for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;, but still it is very hard.  So far this is the best product I&#x27;ve come across to shave with.  It lathers easy, last a long time and doesn&#x27;t have a heavy smell to it.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal.  A larger than usual bar for a good price.  The lather was great and had a light pleasant odor.  This will last a long time!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it! He prefers this shaving soap over the other shaving creams/gels he has been using.  It has a good lather and fresh scent. It leaves his face soft and smooth too!</li>
    <li> This is my first try with shaving soap and so far it is great!  Will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> Great shaving soap! It smells wonderful....very fresh and clean.  It produces a good lather for a very close shave. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I found out my tap water had the lowest reading when comparing the refrigerator water(104), counter top filter(53) and tap water(41) TDS reading.  The refrigerator water was tested at room temperature.  Must be the Lava rocks.</li>
    <li> Bought this a few months back but just got a chance to start using it in the last week.  Excellent lather.  Clean shave.  Leaves my face feeling clean.  I would give it 5 stars but the puck is not shaped for a bowl, more of a cup.  Good product compared to others that I have used.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my husband and he loves it. I creates a nice rich lather and smells great. There was also a bonus pack of five double edged razor blades included in the shipment. The customer service has also been great with emails making sure that the order arrived and and that we were completely satisfied. We will absolutely buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> quick to lather and moisturizes the face. it us my do to shaving soap. it lasts about a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shave soaps.  This one is the best.  The lather is thick, it&#x27;s easy to create, and it smells great.  I look forward to shaving because this soap is so great.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as a gift. He seems to enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Received the Henry Cavendish Himalaya shaving soap in well within time as stated. Excellent soap with great lather and soothing on the skin. Best shave soap</li>
    <li> Love this shaving soap, it lathers great for a smooth shave and has a very subtle sent. Leaves my face smooth and moisturized. It&#x27;s a good idea to use a quality shaving brush to insure you achieve a good lather. I found that buy placing my puck in a porcelain shaving mug/bowl and carefully heating it in a microwave for around 70 seconds on DEFROST, you will find the puck will liquify and fill out the bottom of your shaving mug/bowl, allowing you to work up a good lather without the puck moving around. I recommend this product to any individual looking out there for &amp;#34;that perfect shaving soap.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> good stuff. smooth shave</li>
    <li> Lathers well, pleasing scent..</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it! It cost a little more than some others but well worth it!  A+++</li>
    <li> Mild soap, average lathering qualities, very light and pleasant scent doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  If you&#x27;re looking for a soap that is not overpowering and does the job well at a low price then this is a good soap.  If your looking for something fancy with a strong scent then look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Put this shaving soap in my husband&#x27;s christmas stocking. He has been using it everyday now and LOVES it. He has tried many different shaving soaps and says this leaves his skin feeling the smoothest.  We will definately be reordering. Great product and ordering and delivery was easy and  on time.</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizing, cushioning shave soap with a very mild pleasing scent.  It also has natural ingredients, a nice plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a short while, but so far I like it!  Lathers nicely and has a great aroma.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shave soap. It has a light fragrance my girl loves. Shaves smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I use this with preshave oil and Nivea post shave balm.</li>
    <li> My first and only shave-soap.  Can&#x27;t imagine it gets any better than this.  Leaves a luxurious lather that the blade just slides through!  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results I get with this shave soap.  What&#x27;s to dislike... All natural, great lather, smooth shave and a fragrance my wife loves.&lt;br /&gt;For me the best way to build a lather is to soak my brush in hot water for about 30 seconds.  Then I lightly shake the brush into the sink twice to release most of the water.  I swirl the brush over the soap only long enough to cover the ends of the bristles with soap.  Then I swirl the brush over my face until I develop a full lather.  Finally I squeeze the bristles between my thumb and finger to remove the remaining soap and rub it onto my face.  I&#x27;m now ready for a close and comfortable shave.  When I need to make more than one pass with my razor, I just apply a little warm water to the shaved area and make another smooth pass of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;Try one puck of this soap.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Like me, you&#x27;ll be back to order more.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the negative reviews about this soap not providing a good lather.  I use the soap every day.  I also have the hardest water you could imagine, yet I can create a great full lather using the process I described above.  Also, I have never received email asking for anything but an honest review of their products.  I was happy to give the soap and their blades 5-star reviews.  When I emailed them with a question or comment, I received a fast and courteous response.  The soap I ordered did not have the 5-pack of blades.  I emailed John and received the blades within a week.  I loved the blades so much, I ordered 100 more.  I&#x27;ve ordered enough soap and blades to have a year or more of great shaves.  I&#x27;ve also read that people complain about the price.  They offer ordering discounts for the soap and blades.  Please try the soap and blades.  Like me, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;PS.  I don&#x27;t know John or Loretta.  I just know they provide great service and products.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Ordered four more pucks of soap.  Great Christmas gift for friends and family.  These boxes had the five blade packs included.  Love the soap and the blades.  Use both every morning.  Order the soap and try the blades.  They are very close to the Derby Extry blade, but they last longer for me.ve blade packs included.  Love the soap and the blades.  Use both every morning.  Order the soap and try the blades.  They are very close to the Derby Extry blade, but they last longer for me.</li>
    <li> Have as a gift. Arrived on time and had little to no scent. My brother loved it as he has allergies.&lt;br /&gt;The follow up emails are very helpful and a nice customer service touch.</li>
    <li> great product and fast shipping thanks.</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a new safety-razor gift, I was careful to pick quality items to assure a successful shave. It was easy to melt into his soap box. I chose this soap because of its ingredients. My husband likes the rich lather and I like his soft skin ;)  We are both very happy with the quality of this moisturizing soap. Yes, we will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves. Lathers well and smells nice.</li>
    <li> Lathers well and seems to last a good while.</li>
    <li> This generous bar leaves a smooth feel after the shave. Great fresh smell and well worth the price. Nice change from my usual drug store shave soap.</li>
    <li> real old world feel to the whole shaving process now.It brings you back in time when shaving was for the rich</li>
    <li> Compared to others, this is just ok.  I use about 8 different tubs for shaving, this is toward the bottom of my options. Not a great lather! Not a great shave!</li>
    <li> I can use this soap, without my pre-shave oil. With that being said it saves me $$$. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Feel better than shaving cream and I get a close shave without razor burn.</li>
    <li> The shave soap is fine. Nothing outstanding, but it lathers well.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality shave soap and creates a rich lather when applied with a brush.  It has high lubricity and left a smooth shave.  It is a bit more expensive than my standard soaps, but it is a notch above.  My final judgement will come when I see how long the puck lasts compared to the others.</li>
    <li> Since going to DE shaving, I have always been looking for a good soap that lathers thick. I have finally found it. This soap needs to be used sparingly because it simply creates tons of lather. I tried the directions on the package. I took a hot shower and left the residual water on my face. While still damp and warm to the touch, I slid the soap puck over my face to leave a slight amount. After warming up the brush, I lathered the soap while on my face. Holy \cow did it lather, I had so much lather that I used the brush to remove it and put the excess in my shaving mug. The thin coating provided enough lather for covering my face for four passes and I still had plenty left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good smell and I like the way it leaves my face feeling after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have learned the secret, this soap should last a loooong time.</li>
    <li> Love this shave bar!!</li>
    <li> I reveived it several days ago and had my first shave yesterday.  I&#x27;m really happy with it.  It smelled nice and I had a very smooth shave.  My face feels soft and hydrated today.  The puck is too tall for my wooden shave soap keeper, but thats not your fault.  Thank you for using QUALITY ingredients -- That is what convinced me to give it a try.  SMELL: is nice, it is mild, clean, woody buttery with some other spice i cant think of right now.  Seems like a small company that really cares about the ingredients, quality, and satisfaction of its customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definetly happy with the purchase and looking forward to my next shave.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap!  Feels great and leave face smooth after shaving, lathers nicely, will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I started back shaving with the old double edge razor, like my father uses, after great dissatisfaction with the modern razors.  They became very expensive and did not last long.  I found that using regular can shave cream was not cutting it and I tried several different types of shave soap before finding Henry Cavendish.  The product was delivered on time, intact and at a very good price.  I have been using it for the last 5-6 days and I have to say this is the best shaving soap, by far, that I have tried.  It goes on great with my brush, moisturizes my skin and the razor just glides over my face, reducing nicks and cuts. I will probably be using this soap for a long time.</li>
    <li> I started using shave soap in 2011 so far this is the best shave soap I have come across (RazorRock was a close second, but it only lasts about half as long). I do have a few others that I would like to try, but my wife is pregnant and even with everything making her sick she still loves this stuff! It&#x27;s clean, it lathers well (even with a cheap brush that is 6 months over due for a replacement) and it is great on the skin. My first puck lasted me 6 months! Amazing stuff! If you&#x27;re even considering it, just stop comparing and try it. Trust me I&#x27;ve done plenary if research for the both of us and this one is at the top of the list.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my husband, and he LOVES it! An added bonus: It makes the entire medicine cabinet smell amazing.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave cream. Lathers up very well. Delivery was quick. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap lathers up nicely and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is a superior shaving experience!  The lather is terrific!  The personalized email with helpful hints from the seller was an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Great product- I like the smell not very perfumey or over powering, subtle.</li>
    <li> A thick kind of pasty cream yet rinses off the razor well. Gives good protection while shaving with my double edged blade. I tend to keep a few different brands of brushless creams and shaving soaps on hand just for a variety as I like to switch off and will continue to add this product to my collection. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Quite a large shave soap. Lathers really well, and the smell is very light and natural.</li>
    <li> First time use, it foamed instead of lathering. Switched to a synthetic brush and it lathered up nicely.</li>
    <li> easy, not too thick, feel a lot smoother after shaving.</li>
    <li> Great product works very well. Not too strong a scent makes good  lather. Very pleased overall.</li>
    <li> very smooth luxurious soap.</li>
    <li> Excellent- EXACTLY what I was looking for- perfect shave, nice but not too strong of a scent.  I prefer shaving soap so I have 1 less liquid to fly with - compact, last forever and economical, and it even passed the wife sniff test :-)</li>
    <li> It is okay. Smells fine, but the scent is masked by the lotion I use afterwards. What I didn&#x27;t appreciate was the harassing amount of e-mails that I received from the vendor. It is soap for Christ sakes.</li>
    <li> Best shaving soap I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I am 61 years old and never used shaving cream but would spend 20.00 for 4 razor blades. So I bought a new razor and this shaving cream. It was the best shave that I ever had. This product is all natural and gives you a really smooth shave. I highly recommend this product!!!! I place another order..</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells good,  lathers like crazy and last forever. Been a month and looks like its barely been touched.  Asking is have sensitive skins and it doesn&#x27;t bother it at all.</li>
    <li> Good lather and smooth shave. Shape is perfect for cup rather than shaving bowl.</li>
    <li> Nice quality shaving soap, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to lather up like cream.  Yes I&#x27;ve tried putting less water, but not as much lather. I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal, but it seems to dry up quicker than shaving cream. I&#x27;ve had other shaving soap that do similar, but this shaving soap has a nice slippery feel as the blade cuts through beard.  Nice, very clean smell.</li>
    <li> Love the soap but before each shave make sure you soak it in a dish with hot water for at least 1 minute before you start to lather. If you don&#x27;t soak it first, the soap will appear on your skin like actual soap rather than the rich lather you expect.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  Works just like it says!!!</li>
    <li> This soap is the best shaving soap I have ever used, knowing that my face is only getting the best, no toxins, or chemicals, This all natural soap leaves my face mosturized and it gives such a close shave, also builds very nice thick lather, would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Best shaving soap I have ever used. I got the best shave I had in awhile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even rubbed over face and head.  Plus the brush</li>
    <li> My first time using a shaving soap and brush so I really have no foundation to compare it to anything else. That said, after using this not going back to shaving cream, I enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> Great mild scent that persists throughout the day. Decent lather without detergents like SLS. Face feels way better than after typical shaving crea,</li>
    <li> Bought this shaving soap for my husband because he has very sensitive skin and breaks out anytime he shaves with any shaving cream. This really works for him as he has not gotten any breakouts so far and said that it is very soothing and leaves his skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> This i my new favorite shave soap.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month and it&#x27;s FANTASTIC!  it smells great but the scent is very subtle.  It lathers incredibly well!  I&#x27;ve tried it with both a Boar and Badger brush.  Both Generate a nice lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, especially around  the base of my neck (I wear a shirt and tie every day so my collar is constantly coming into contact with my skin which usually gets irritated after I&#x27;ve shaved) but I haven&#x27;t had any discomfort or shave bumps after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost as impressive as the product itself is the follow up from the company.  Over the last month they have contacted me twice.  Once to thank me for my purchase and to give me some contact information if I had any trouble (which I didn&#x27;t) and again a few days ago to make sure I was happy with the product so far.  They also threw in a 50% off coupon on the next product of theirs I purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say with absolute certainty that I will be purchasing from them again!</li>
    <li> Superb product and customer service.  Thanks very much.</li>
    <li> I bought this for our son to put in his stocking.  It arrived in perfect condition and smells heavenly!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Quality soap! Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Good lather without a strong scent.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and it meets my expectations.  Produces a rich lather and a pleasant subtle scent.  Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Very nice thick rich lather; I like this shave soap a lot!  Having used so many other brands I think this one will be one of my regulars now!! I would like a little stronger scent though.</li>
    <li> Arrived when promised. Just had first shave.  Good lather....smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This is very good shave soap.  It lathers up very nice and stays on your face until the razor takes it off.  A little bit goes a long way.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth trying. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Great soap, smells good, and lasts a good while.</li>
    <li> Outstanding! I&#x27;ve used other premium shaving soaps but this is what I&#x27;ll be using from now on! Thick lather--especially if you first add a dab of the Cavendish shave cream on your wet brush.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he has enjoyed his shaving routine every night.  The soap foams up nicely, it would work even better if you make circles with the brush clockwise then counter-clockwise, and so on.  Besides the smooth shave, the scent is pleasant without fake, artificial smell.  This is the first shaving soap he has used since switching to double edge blade razor, and we&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice soap. I have have used many soaps in the past, but this one definitely stands out. It has a nice texture and scent. Also, a problem that I have with other soaps is, they make me break out, this one thankfully does not. After shaving with this stuff, it leaves the face feeling moisturized, but without being oily. I would definitely recommend this soap to anyone,  especially to those who are prone to razor bumps or irritation.</li>
    <li> First shaving soap I have purchesed. Worked nice. Learning proper technique to building a good lather is very important. Might try a new brand to compare.</li>
    <li> Took a little bit for my skin to adjust but I use it every day and happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Favourite shaving soap thus far. Nice mild scent, pleasant, but still masculine. I use it to shave my head and face. Lasted a little over a month with that much coverage.</li>
    <li> Great shaving soap and shopping experience.</li>
    <li> showed up quickly with prime.  foams up nicely.  Shea is delightful on the skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It lathers into a very thick cream that stays on my face, doesn&#x27;t slide down my neck. My skin feels great after shaving. Very, very nice. I recommend.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  I brew up my lather in an antique shaving cup and am amazed how this stuff foams up and holds. A bit pricey or it would have gotten 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas with a custom fancy boars head shave brush, a stand, and a shave bowl.  He likes using cream when he shaves his head but when he shaves his face, this is his go to.  It gets him a close shave with less irritation.  He has coarse hair so this is a huge plus.  Also, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but when it lasts as long as this does, it&#x27;s a great value for the money.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
    <li> A great product!!! Highly recommended. Thank you for the fast shipping!!! Perfect gift</li>
    <li> Best shaving soap I have bought, very satisfied</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He has yet to use it but as a woman I&#x27;m very happy w the packaging and the smell</li>
    <li> Unquestionably the best shaving soap in my experience.</li>
    <li> This is a guy thing. Shaving with &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; on your face. Aerosol shaving creams are really convenient, but to really get a smooth shave, I&#x27;ve switched back to shaving soap and a quality boar bristle shaving brush. This is not the same as the aerosols--they&#x27;re actually dry--this is a frictionless, smooth shave--and less messy than the foaming gels.  Update, January 2017: I purchased the product again. Just as satisfied. In between, I used a glycerin based shaving soap. It is far inferior to the Henry Cavendish. Five stars again.  It takes a hair longer. You have to wet the brush with really hot water and heat up the soap with some hot water as well, but there is a visceral satisfaction of the sound of a good brush clinking the edge of the shaving mug and watching the soap foam up. Then there&#x27;s the feeling of brushing the foam onto the beard.  My razor slips easily through my beard without friction. I like the fragrance, the smoothness and the warm pleasure of using shaving soap. Many years ago, I used the soap, and in fact my mug dates back to the 70s, the bristle brush to the 90s. I think it comes down to the saying on my shaving mug, &amp;#34;When a man is tired of pleasure, he is tired of life.&amp;#34;  After trying different soaps on and off, the Henry Cavendish Shave Soap has a very Victorian ring to it. The feel is ultra chic. The  co-founder suggests skipping the brush and shaving in the shower. Nah, get a good brush. It lasts and is well worth the sensation. For the ultimate sensation, have your lover soap your face. It will be a loving shared a experience.</li>
    <li> Here is a copy of what you said in your feedback, as a reminder:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;All of those who received these (5) have told me how much they love it. I have told friends about it as well&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Has a pleasant scent. Generates a nice lather if you use a soft brush. I have used both badger and boar hair and I was able to get a nice lather with my badger brush. My boar hair brush just seemed to stiff. I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. Looks like this bar will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> After paying $40 for shaving soap the value and quality of the shave were both delights. The shaving foam is incredible. It makes my face feel better after the shave than it felt before. Recommended highly.  A  month later I am regretting my choice. I use Feather blades and the more expensive shave cream held up better and protected my face more. Great lather, but not the protection I had come to be used to</li>
    <li> Just about half way through my first puck (4 months of alternating rotation) and I&#x27;m really enjoying it. The scent is mild and pleasant, with a lot of the shea butter fragrance coming through. The lather itself is thick and rich, with a lot of moisturizing power. This has become my preferred soap in the winter months when the air is dry and my skin needs some extra care. The only reason I took off a star is that the soap can be a little unforgiving if you don&#x27;t get the water/lather ratio just right. I&#x27;ve had a few occasions where the lather was (very) slightly drier that it should have been, and the abundance of natural oils pulled and clung to the head of my razor causing some skipping and the occasional neck burn. I can usually get away with a larger margin of error with other soaps and croaps. However, when it&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s really good!</li>
    <li> This soap is remarkable. All natural, nothing artificial. Feels great on my skin and my razor just glides as I shave. In my opinion, if there are any negative words from other customers,it has to be a result of improper technique. I have been shaving for many years using a double edge razor, shaving brush and mug. The soap is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too being that this is the first time I have used a soap like this for shaving, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and does it well. It very gentle feeling and smelling, lathers well, no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best shaving soap I have used. Lathers up great. Mild scent is perfect. Great product for a great shave. A+ vendors and the price is right.</li>
    <li> smooth shave, smells great.</li>
    <li> very nice works great love the way it makes my skin feel so soft much better than another i have tried</li>
    <li> The soap has little or no smell, lathers very easy and fits a regular shave mug perfectly. I use a DE razor that is very aggressive an suffer no burn. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This soap makes shaving smooth and comfortable. Just some warm water and brush and this soap makes shaving a breeze!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and leaves my skin soft!!  Just added to this review. Out of the 4 soaps I have used this is one of the best so far. Just bought some woolfat gonna try that one soon but for the price I have NO complaints. Love this soap!!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is so picky when it comes to shave soaps. I have had him try 3 different types and he didn&#x27;t like any of them until this one came along. He LOVES it. It leaves his skin feeling nice, soft, and smooth and also well conditioned after shaving. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with this product! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> excellent soap easy to use and keeps moist.</li>
    <li> I love it! I have very sensitive skin and with this soap I don&#x27;t get any irritation. It smells great and really relaxes the skin.</li>
    <li> I like the soap, so far. It leaves a creamy type lather,and is soft to the face ( not just a foam feeling). Rather buttery !</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing, lathers great, an protects from getting cuts! It&#x27;s great for people with sensitive skin or or those who don&#x27;t want to smell like shaving product all day.</li>
    <li> Good product-I like a warm shave and this meets my needs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap as a gift for my husband.  He loves it!  It&#x27;s natural and excellent for sensitive skin.  It leaves your face nice and smooth and it makes shaving so much easier.  Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Suds up well and smells great. Takes some getting used to vs traditional shaving cream, but my boyfriend likes it and uses it often.</li>
    <li> Very good lather, nice scent. Would defiantly buy again.</li>
    <li> Produces excellent  lather and  leaves your skin silky smooth</li>
    <li> Background: I don&#x27;t shave my face. I only shave my head and neck. My neck is very sensitive and I always get irritation with a razor so I&#x27;m completely limited to electric shavers despite my enthusiasm for the results. I&#x27;ve tried everything on my head except a straight razor on my scalp, including cartridge razors, the Head Blade, the Skull Shaver, and a double edge razor. The cartridge gives me the closest shave in the quickest amount of time but leaves my skin irritated and can take forever on parts where my grain goes in a million different directions. The Head Blade is a nice concept but the cartridges are real shit IMHO. the Skull Shaver is super fast, convenience, but not very close and leaves my scalp irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I realized after looking into a number of shaving forums and sites that maybe my problem is what lather I&#x27;m using. The Head Blade brand stuff called Head Lube is slick and refreshing but does nothing to exfoliate my scalp or invigorate the hairs to not lay so flat, but other than that I&#x27;ve just used some cheap gel foam thing from Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here enters the Henry Cavendish shaving soap, which just arrived in the mail with a new badger shave brush... oh what a joy it is to shave now. I&#x27;m also waiting for a straight edge to arrive so I can try that but I&#x27;ll tell you right now, as is, this is a splendid product worlds better than the bullsh*t gel/foam in a can that I&#x27;ve been using. The scent is very light, it lubricates my cartridge razor quite well, it doesn&#x27;t dry out in seconds flat like the gel/foam, and leaves my skin nicely moisturized though not greasy. I haven&#x27;t compared it to other similar shave soaps and I really want to ding one star because I feel it&#x27;s missing a hint of menthol or something similarly refreshing which I loved about the Head Lube, but the quality of the ingredients brings this soap right back to a 5 out of 5 in my book. I honestly have no reason to explore other products since most others don&#x27;t have such nice ingredients, despite the possibility that they may feel or perform better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to using shaving soap but I&#x27;ve tried some other brands and I&#x27;m starting to settle on Henry Cavendish. It is easy on the skin, lathers great and I like that it&#x27;s all natural. It has a minimal scent  (almost none) which works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company also was diligent to make sure my order arrived on time and had no issues.</li>
    <li> The all natural product I was using is no longer made so I tried this.  It gave a very smooth shave with my straight razor, great lather and nice scent.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Lather isn&#x27;t great at all. But thats probably the price to pay for an all natural soap. Scent is not strong, but i do wonder what it is. I dislike when an all natural product hides ingredients by saying &#x27;fragrance&#x27;</li>
    <li> Lathers well and skin feels smooth after shaving. Exspensive for soap though.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based off of the rave reviews, but it does not live up to the hype. When i opened the box and took the soap out of the plastic i smelled it, and it smells fantastic. I was very excitied to use it. This soap does not lather well out all, and when it does, it dries out on your face really fast. I have used this product for about 2 weeks now, hoping it would get better, but it never has.....stay away from this product! And the reason why it gets great reviews, is because when it arrives there is a slip of paper that says, write a good review and we (The company who makes this product) will give you 100% off your next purchase of this product. I have been using amazon since its inception, and never heard or seen a company do this. This makes me think more than ever now, that some reviews, are 100% lies! DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT BASED ON THE REVIEWS!!!</li>
    <li> Just as described. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> The shaving soap has an excellent aroma, for one. The lather is extremely rich and lubricates the skin very well. One of the biggest added bonuses of the Henry Cavendish is that it treats the skin, so when you shave, your skin has actually been moisturized. You don&#x27;t get that rubbery feeling that you get with most other products.</li>
    <li> First order of this product...super shaving soap.  Nice, luxurious lather with excellent viscosity.  Highly recommended.  Typically, I purchase Geo. F. Trumper soap; nice to know there is a great company here in the U.S. that I can turn to for superior shaving soap!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Just which to a safety razor and purchased Shea butter shave soap, it was the best shave I had in years. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product, very satisfied.  Don&#x27;t forget to order a nice mug or bowl with a good brush.  Enjoy your smooth shaving.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my choice of soap. Finally got to use it when I got my soap cup. Skin feels very soft &amp;amp; refreshed after use.</li>
    <li> Great smell, nice texture, the blade glides across the face with no pull. The fact there are no crap ingredients is important to me. As a cancer RN, I do not want parabens, phthalates or other immune disruptors on my face. Chemicals on face + nicked face &#x3D; home made inoculation. The more you know, the more you will appreciate the quality of this product. My only &#x27;complaint&#x27; - scratch that - &#x27;concern&#x27;, is that I have shave soap bowls, not cups. There were no measurements for comparison so I had the minor inconvenience of cutting the bar in half, melting 1/2 of it in the microwave, and chilling it in a wide based cup so that the new size would fit into my bowl. A very minor concern consider the quality of the product.  AND speaking of quality, the customer service has been impeccable. I got the boilerplate letter that some vendors send out. I replied with my concerns. I have had two subsequent emails that were spot on to my concerns...even to the point of offering melting suggestions. (Thanks John!) Great product. Great customer service. You have a new, long-time customer and advocate when I teach cosmetic classes at local cancer centers.</li>
    <li> My wife orders this for me on her Prime account. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several months now, I&#x27;m on my second puck and I am still impressed. I took the first puck and threw the remainder of it in my travel bag and I use that while traveling. I don&#x27;t even carry a brush, I lather it up in my hands like regular soap and it works a treat that way too. Mixed with an old fashioned safety razor my face doesn&#x27;t feel so much like hamburger when finished and my face comes out smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finish shaving and have cleaned my face off I like to take a little that is left over and rub it into my skin...While I said my face doesn&#x27;t feel so much like hamburger after shaving there is still a little burn, I don&#x27;t equate it to the soap, its just how my face always has been, So with that said, the only down side I see is that they do not offer an after shave balm.:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Brian</li>
    <li> Nice lather, not too heavy or thin, very pleasant smell, not antiseptic like many other shave soaps.  I will repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks so far and I am impressed!  Keep in mind I am bald and shave my head and face every other day so it is important for me to have a good product that does not irritate my skin.  Well so far it is great!  No need to use any sort of cream after I shave.  I think I found the product I will be using for years to come!  Thank you</li>
    <li> lathers very well , nice smell , leaves skin soft</li>
    <li> A good quality soap at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Actually enjoy shaving</li>
    <li> Great Product, exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brothers birthday. Seems to be a wonderful soap. Very hard, long lasting. Builds a wonderful silky lather.</li>
    <li> Smooth and creamy. Great lubrication.  No irritation.  Excellent shave soap.  Will definitely buy again.  Good value for the price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The soap lathered up quite easily and provided a slick, cushioned shave.  It did not produce the most lather of any soap I have tried but it was sufficient enough to yield a very good shave.</li>
    <li> Works great with no skin irritation. Recommended.</li>
    <li> My father used Old Spice for decades. Can&#x27;t find them anymore (not made).  These are a good substitute.</li>
    <li> I like it so much I bought another to be sure I don&#x27;t run out.  It generates a rich fragrant lather.  I gave up on the modern 4-6 blade razors and went back to how my dad shaved.  I&#x27;ll never go back to a can of shaving cream and expensive razors.  I never got a shave as good and smooth as I do with this soap.  You will have to try it to see the difference.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> This is a great lathering shave soap with a nice fragrance...the puck seems to just keep going.&lt;br /&gt;Just moisten it with a few drops of water and&lt;br /&gt;twirl your brush for a smooth shave. I think it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;my favorite soap so far...excellent deal and it last&#x27;s longer than the others.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers up nicely and provides for a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> My husband really enjoys the shaving soap and the blades.</li>
    <li> I used and liked this soap. Good fragrance and easy lathering. The only issue I have with this purchase is that they stated plus 5 double edge blades included. I only received 1 blade.</li>
    <li> Lathers really well and has a non chemical and non offensive smell. I really enjoy this product and will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Makes your face feel real smooth after the shave.</li>
    <li> I thought this would make a nice little gift for my husband.  One of those gifts for no reason....Well,.....Too bad I&#x27;ve already staked my claim to it! OK, I guess I will share it with him.  When I first received this, we both tested it out.  It just smells so freaking amazing, I couldn&#x27;t help but to use it, and I am so glad I did!  It comes in a nice, large, 3.8 ounce bar.  The round bar is ideal for use with the shaving brush I got him a couple of months back, and to top it off, I also got a couple different kinds of old time razors.  He now has a shaving set up that reminds me of the one my grandfather had over 35 years ago.  The bonus pack of blades was a nice little surprise, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to shave my legs with it, and all I can say is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;!  My razor glides right over it, so quickly and easily, and it leaves my legs so wonderfully soft and smooth.  I am so glad I was chosen to receive this at a great, promotional price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  This Shaving Soap by Nectarine is fantastic!</li>
    <li> For the shaving newbies, here&#x27;s a little tip. :)&lt;br /&gt;Let your soap soak in a bowl for a couple of minutes. What that does is Help to get an amazing lather to help your shaving experience be absolutely beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this shave soap has no parabens. the ingredients are really nice, its made in the USA which is also absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also comes with razor blades, which is like getting a free present!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me get to this soap. The Himalaya with shea butter and soy shave soap. Please say that 10 times fast, :-). It has an aroma that is not overwhelming, not overpowering, it&#x27;s just right. It smells clean, which is exactly what I want my man to smell like.I really love when it gets into a lather. Its a nice leather that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy afterwards. There&#x27;s so many soaps that used ingredients that are just so heavy, that I can&#x27;t ever feel like I actually got clean from using it. Because of that weird greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Havent had a chance to try the blades, but the soap pleasantly surprised me. I thought it would dry my skin out, but apparently due to the shea butter, its moisturizing. Lots of lather. Nice for shaving on the go.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent - not too strong. Quality product with ingredients free of harmful chemicals. Classy packaging.    My box came with a 100% off coupon that the company honored despite the fact that this offer had changed.    Definitely recommend this company.</li>
    <li> Order came within just a few days and was well packaged.  This was my first time using this shaving soap and BOY was it pleasing. It lathered up very easily and kept my face moisturized without drying out, as some soaps and creams will do.  The shave itself was shocking in a good way, the razor seemed to flow with more ease than before and the mild manly fragrance made me feel I had at last gotten my hands on quality.  It is a pleasure to shave now, not a burden.  I highly recommend this product and will certainly order again.</li>
    <li> Lathers very well &amp; provides one if the smoothest shaves that i&#x27;ve experienced in quite a while. No razor drag or burn. Leaves the skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended over many of the others that I have tried. Economical as well.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I particularly liked the note of thanks from John,the Co Founder. Excellent product and will buy more.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
    <li> Good product. Lathers up quickly and thickly. Leaves no residue. Would recommend to all who are looking for a good value in a shaving product.</li>
    <li> Best shaving soap I have tried.  Thick, creamy lather that moisturizes your skin without being oily.  Much better that any of the expensive popular brands I have tried and even so-called &amp;#34;handmade&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;handcrafted&amp;#34; soaps. Pricing is great for such a high quality soap and with Amazon Prime shipping, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great soap but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Delivery was prompt. Soap lathers well and moisturizes the skin. This is a bit smaller puck than I thought which turned out to be great because it fits my bowl better. I really do like it.</li>
    <li> Lathers great and smells good!</li>
