### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The amount of time it has saved just with the 1st stencil is priceless.  </li>
      <li>After spending a lot of time tracing and sometimes not coming out with a really good stencil, I find this machine to be very good.</li>
      <li>Works great and saves so.much time with tattoos</li>
      <li>Item works great.</li>
      <li>For the non pro tattoo person this unit is a great value.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Using the instructions provided we could not get a good stencil to come out.  </li>
      <li>Its a good working machine.</li>
      <li>I love it great product</li>
      <li>Also, the first stencil we made was from a drawing on trace paper (vellum) and it was probably the best stencil I have seen in 2.5 years.  </li>
      <li>but i watched a tutorial on YouTube and it became very easy to use</li>
      <li>You can not put color images through it an expect it to transfer, many people seem to think that</li>
      <li>and you will be up to speed and able to use the machine like a pro.  </li>
      <li>HE LOVE IT...</li>
      <li>The reviews on this machine are mixed at best.  </li>
      <li>Make sure the copier makes reverses when you buy one.</li>
      <li>In short I think that this machine and supplier are the best.</li>
      <li>Loved it but couldn&#x27;t find directions at first ...</li>
      <li>if you are just beginning to tattoo and looking for a cheap printer this is a pretty good deal, the directions it comes with don&#x27;t teach you how to use it</li>
      <li>IT REALLY WORK!!!</li>
      <li>make sure the original print is a clear original though..</li>
      <li>They tell you to use good quality transfer paper, the normal paper you use will likely be fine, we use Spirit Thermal paper.  </li>
      <li>understand how people can get away with legal robbery,and thats all this thing is,pure robbery!!</li>
      <li>I can tell you that this is SO worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Dose not make good stencils at all, uses a whole sheet of paper for one tiny stencil.wish they had an upgraded machine.</li>
      <li>Watch the video to learn how to use it right</li>
      <li>As per the tech support they are very fast at trying to resolve the issue.</li>
      <li>If you watch the video for it you will understand very fast how to get it to work.</li>
      <li>Did not have any issues getting it to work, does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>This machine works exactly how it is designed to work.</li>
      <li>pure junk.</li>
      <li>If it breaks down in the coming months I will leave a follow up review, but right out of the box, I LOVE</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>A really dark stencil, you must wipe away excess before starting tattoo and still have a good outline.</li>
      <li>Even if you only do ONE tattoo a week, this is well worth it.</li>
      <li>I finally just took the transfer paper apart and taped the carbon to the blank paper and ran it through the machine and that works fine.</li>
      <li>Did not work at all brand new out of the box.</li>
      <li>junk, didnt work one time out of the box, it would stop in the middle of copying which left huge gaps in the stencil.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t the exact model f this machine, but the mechanics are the same: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;sR0Axp5e73c</li>
      <li>Load the actual print from the top and face down until you hear a beep.</li>
      <li>Bought this for 2 professional Tattoo artists here in Salem Oregon.  </li>
      <li>and you will find the operation is so easy a small child could do it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Stencils come out super dark and crisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I finally gave up on the instructions and loaded the paper in minus the onion skin with the yellow side up from the rear of the cover and closed the cover as the carbon started to show evenly across the top.</li>

    <li> Once you get this the directions are very complex. If you watch the video for it you will understand very fast how to get it to work. As per the tech support they are very fast at trying to resolve the issue. I would recommend this for any tattoo artist.</li>
    <li> Item works great. The supplier takes care of problems in a prompt manor. For the non pro tattoo person this unit is a great value. Make sure the copier makes reverses when you buy one. In short I think that this machine and supplier are the best. Please support amazon and supplier.[[ASIN:B003RRTUNG Tattoo Flash Thermal Copier Machine STENCIL Maker]]</li>
    <li> dont buy it. mine stopped working after 1 month. for no reason. just stopped making stencils. wont burn the image onto the paper. dont even know why. pure junk. 200 dollars down the drain.</li>
    <li> do not buy does not need to be sold!cannot understand how people can get away with legal robbery,and thats all this thing is,pure robbery!!</li>
    <li> Dose not make good stencils at all, uses a whole sheet of paper for one tiny stencil.wish they had an upgraded machine.</li>
    <li> After spending a lot of time tracing and sometimes not coming out with a really good stencil, I find this machine to be very good. A really dark stencil, you must wipe away excess before starting tattoo and still have a good outline.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son ..he do tattoo...HE LOVE IT...IT REALLY WORK!!! IT DO WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE...</li>
    <li> Its a good working machine.Took me three tries to get it goin........now I&#x27;ve got the hang of it .Works like its supposed too every time.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving my machine I promptly opened it only to find that it was warped and incapable of making stenciles. Absolute waste of $200.</li>
    <li> if you are just beginning to tattoo and looking for a cheap printer this is a pretty good deal, the directions it comes with don&#x27;t teach you how to use it that well (which i think is the reason for so many bad reviews) but i watched a tutorial on YouTube and it became very easy to use</li>
    <li> The instructions were horrible! I finally gave up on the instructions and loaded the paper in minus the onion skin with the yellow side up from the rear of the cover and closed the cover as the carbon started to show evenly across the top. Load the actual print from the top and face down until you hear a beep. press copy and voila! make sure the original print is a clear original though..</li>
    <li> Did not work at all brand new out of the box. I watched the video and read the instructions. This machine is junk and I recommend choosing a different one if you want a stencil maker. I bought this despite the negative reviews. Buyer beware it is junk.</li>
    <li> I cannot stress enough that y&#x27;all need to look at the YouTube videos before trying to use this. Ordered it Friday with one day shipping, got it on Saturday and my brother in law placed a rad tat on me Sunday - worked like a charm.  If it breaks down in the coming months I will leave a follow up review, but right out of the box, I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the exact model f this machine, but the mechanics are the same: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;sR0Axp5e73c</li>
    <li> The reviews on this machine are mixed at best.  I can tell you that this is SO worth the money.  The amount of time it has saved just with the 1st stencil is priceless.  They include a web address where you can watch a video, and I can tell you, watch the short 1 minute or so video and you will be up to speed and able to use the machine like a pro.  It does come with an instruction booklet, however, I found you may as well not read it, and throw it away.  We read the instructions and got confused and frustrated.  Again, watch the video and you will find the operation is so easy a small child could do it.  They tell you to use good quality transfer paper, the normal paper you use will likely be fine, we use Spirit Thermal paper.  Also, the first stencil we made was from a drawing on trace paper (vellum) and it was probably the best stencil I have seen in 2.5 years.  Even if you only do ONE tattoo a week, this is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Works great and saves so.much time with tattoos</li>
    <li> junk, didnt work one time out of the box, it would stop in the middle of copying which left huge gaps in the stencil. not happy at all, i returned it.</li>
    <li> It took some practice using it .learned you got to scotch tape the white sheet to the carbon or it just rolls it up in machine .good after got past that.</li>
    <li> Dont purchase  this, piece of  crap</li>
    <li> Bought this for 2 professional Tattoo artists here in Salem Oregon.  They are not tech people so had a really hard time trying to get the machine to work.  I finally had to come and figure out how to work the machine.  Using the instructions provided we could not get a good stencil to come out.  I finally just took the transfer paper apart and taped the carbon to the blank paper and ran it through the machine and that works fine.</li>
    <li> Watch the video to learn how to use it right and you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stencils come out super dark and crisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any issues with jamming or anything else that others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if some people are just having bad luck or not smart enough enough figure it out, but this thing has worked like a champ for me.</li>
    <li> Did not have any issues getting it to work, does exactly what it is supposed to do. You can not put color images through it an expect it to transfer, many people seem to think that but it doesn&#x27;t work like that. This machine works exactly how it is designed to work. Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Loved it but couldn&#x27;t find directions at first ... after that part of figuring that it I love it great product</li>
