      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair like most of brushes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I invested.</li>
      <li>I love the Ibiza EX5, because it is lightweight.  </li>
      <li>It took me two practice runs of getting used to the size of this brush, but on the third try, it was perfect!!!  </li>
      <li>was that the Ibiza has twice the bristles of the cheap one.</li>
      <li>Finish it off with a light hairspray.)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight so easier on the arm and hand.</li>
      <li>Best round brush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>Hair glides smoothly &amp; cork handle stays secure in the hand.</li>
      <li>Most definitely worth every penny if you are a person that blow</li>
      <li>Worth the $!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large, but very light weight.</li>
      <li>It is lightweight, the cork handle offers great grip, the bristles really grab and hold the hair</li>
      <li>It makes a lovely blow out and leaves hair very sleek and smooth</li>
      <li>By following his tips and brushes he uses, I hope to be as good as him.</li>
      <li>Most important, my husband&#x27;s head did a complete 180!  </li>
      <li>Received quickly.</li>
      <li>Definitely good for long hair.</li>
      <li>Both are great brushes, but I&#x27;m just learning to master this round brush technique to avoid using a curling wand or iron.</li>
      <li>Great round brush gives a lot of body.</li>
      <li>well worth it.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny and will last for years I am sure.</li>
      <li>The brush looks big, but is very light weight with the cork handle.</li>
      <li>I have fine naturally wavy hair...and a lot of it.  </li>
      <li>once I used it with the hot hair dryer every thing burned out.</li>
      <li>I never knew how much a hair brush can make a difference in styling hair!</li>
      <li>SOOOOO MUCH!</li>
      <li>First thing I noticed when I looked at it</li>
      <li>I have very fine long highlighted curly hair and a ton of it.</li>
      <li>She showed me how the brush should be full all the way around with soft bristles, and to use a very large brush...</li>
      <li>I have always loved the way my hair looks when I walk out of the salon, and over the years have gotten fairly good at round-brushing it smooth and straight,  (I have never used a flat iron as I am afraid of damaging my hair), but I could never get it to bounce like my hairstylist does.  </li>
      <li>So, if you have fine hair that needs extra volume...this is your brush!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing for bangs too, so sleek and soft and smooth until the next wash and blow dry.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really stand up.</li>
      <li>Can really tell the difference in shine and smoothness when I use this brush.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I never thought I could get so much from a hairbrush.</li>
      <li>I like my hair to be straight.  </li>
      <li>But the long bristles grip my curly/wavy hair well and leaves it smooth and with lots of body.  </li>
      <li>He is a rising star in the hair world, he has worked with top celebrity hairstylists, and has worked with a few celebrities himself.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t pull out as much as other brushes and I was able to blow-dry a larger section.  </li>
      <li>the only thing I regret is not buying the Ibiza first.</li>
      <li>large enough that my hair would not fully wrap around and then pull up and out or up and to the front when brushing.  </li>
      <li>This extra large brush works for medium-long hair</li>
      <li>My hairdresser uses the same brand and highly recommended it!</li>
      <li>BUT WOW AM</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the handle; it was to thin and especially so right</li>
      <li>I usually use a hot air brush, but while on vacation in Europe, the hot air brush stopped working</li>
      <li>I was a bit skeptical to purchase it since it was a pretty penny for a hair brush, but it was well worth it!</li>
      <li>I first towel dry or blow dry using my fingers to get the excess water out and then use [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I was very hesitant to spend $48 for a hair brush, but based on the other reviews I took a leap of faith and got it.  </li>
      <li>It makes a huge difference when you are drying long, thick and curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, dry, slightly curly hair that used to fall flat at the crown and frizz out toward the ends when styled with a standard round hairbrush from CVS.</li>
      <li>The cork on the handle completely came off in my hand after 15 minutes of blow drying on my very first use, leaving just a spindly stick behind.  </li>

    <li> The cork on the handle completely came off in my hand after 15 minutes of blow drying on my very first use, leaving just a spindly stick behind.  Not exactly what I expected after paying $48 for a hair brush.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH SOOOOO MUCH! I&#x27;VE BEEN BLOW DRYING MY HAIR FOR ALMOST 4 YEARS AND I HAVE GONE THROUGH BRUSH AFTER BRUSH AND WHEN MY STYLIST RECOMMENDED TO ME TO GET THIS BRUSH AND I LOOKED IT UP ON AMAZON I HESITATED TO BUY IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT COST A LOT BUT WOW AM I HAPPY I DID. I TRUST MY STYLIST SO I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE GREAT!!! I AM GOING TO ORDER THE MEDIUM ONE AS WELL :)</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I was a bit skeptical to purchase it since it was a pretty penny for a hair brush, but it was well worth it! I never knew how much a hair brush can make a difference in styling hair! The brush looks big, but is very light weight with the cork handle. I have thin hair and this brush makes me look like I have so much volume all day long, without the use of any hair products! My stylist recommended this brush and I&#x27;m indebted to her for it. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a brush to use for styling my fine, thin hair, not to mention that I&#x27;m not very good at blow drying my hair with a brush.  I usually use a hot air brush, but while on vacation in Europe, the hot air brush stopped working and I had to use the blow dryers in the hotels with a little brush I had and my hair looked so much better.  So, once I got home, I started looking for a REAL brush, ordered this one because of the reviews and it works perfectly every time.  I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair like most of brushes.  It&#x27;s large, but very light weight.</li>
    <li> I love the Ibiza EX5, because it is lightweight.  It makes a huge difference when you are drying long, thick and curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine long highlighted curly hair and a ton of it. I like my hair to be straight.  This brush just shaved 15mins off my blow-dry.  It didn&#x27;t pull out as much as other brushes and I was able to blow-dry a larger section.  This is a great brush.</li>
    <li> Perfect blow-out every time. This extra large brush works for medium-long hair but I&#x27;d probably get only size down next time for my shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got long long hair. I needed a good brush to flatten it out without letting the ends flip up and out. I wanted boars hair and this one has it. However, I didn&#x27;t like the price of this one. I bought a cheaper one - and that is what I got - I didn&#x27;t like the handle; it was to thin and especially so right where you hold it with your fingers. That and the smooth handle didn&#x27;t offer a good grip. It gave me hand cramps when blowing out my hair. I splurged and bought the Ibiza because of the handle. First thing I noticed when I looked at it was that the Ibiza has twice the bristles of the cheap one. I pulled the Ibiza through my hair and it was incredible - like driving an Audi L series but for your hair. Spend the extra money and get the Ibiza. You won&#x27;t regret it... the only thing I regret is not buying the Ibiza first.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It gets through my thick hair and I use it with a hairdryer to straighten my curly hair.  Works great and good quality</li>
    <li> Definitely good for long hair. Can really tell the difference in shine and smoothness when I use this brush. Especially like the cork handle for ease of handling. However, I have pretty thick hair so it doesn&#x27;t really stand up. A brush with artificial combs combined with boars hair would probably be better for suited for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Received quickly. Packaged and made well. I would recommend for anyone who blows dry their hair daily as it doesn&#x27;t pull or knot hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine naturally wavy hair...and a lot of it.  I have it at various lengths at currently in a just-below-the-chin-length swinging bob.  I have always loved the way my hair looks when I walk out of the salon, and over the years have gotten fairly good at round-brushing it smooth and straight,  (I have never used a flat iron as I am afraid of damaging my hair), but I could never get it to bounce like my hairstylist does.  So, one day I did my hair and showed her.  I asked her what I was doing wrong.  Her answer was...\\&quot;It&#x27;s all in the brush.\\&quot;  She showed me how the brush should be full all the way around with soft bristles, and to use a very large brush...large enough that my hair would not fully wrap around and then pull up and out or up and to the front when brushing.  Well I scoured the internet and read all the raving reviews of this brush.  It took me two practice runs of getting used to the size of this brush, but on the third try, it was perfect!!!  I went to work and boy did heads turn!  Most important, my husband&#x27;s head did a complete 180!  So, if you have fine hair that needs extra volume...this is your brush!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(FYI I first towel dry or blow dry using my fingers to get the excess water out and then use [[ASIN:B0002JNRCM REDKEN by Redken: GUTS VOLUME SPRAY FOAM 10.5 OZ]] or [[ASIN:B00180VW9O CATWALK by Tigi: ROOT BOOST SPRAY FOR TEXTURE 8.5 OZ]] followed by [[ASIN:B000JPM2HK Redken By Redken - Outshine 01 Anti-Frizz Polishing Milk 3.4 Oz]] or [[ASIN:B000BIUGSM Bumble and Bumble Styling Lotion (8 Ounces)]] although any volume foam and anti-frizz lotion would probably work just as well.  Finish it off with a light hairspray.)</li>
    <li> Great brush  Easy to manipulate when drying hair  Nice weight great construction</li>
    <li> I purchased this EX5 and also a medium Ibiza and prefer the medium for my medium length layered hair. Both are great brushes, but I&#x27;m just learning to master this round brush technique to avoid using a curling wand or iron. It makes a lovely blow out and leaves hair very sleek and smooth and I can create a subtle beachy wave. It&#x27;s light weight so easier on the arm and hand. It&#x27;s amazing for bangs too, so sleek and soft and smooth until the next wash and blow dry. Most definitely worth every penny if you are a person that blow dries your hair regularly. Sectioning hair off is crucial as is letting it dry about 75 to 80% before using the brush to finish off the blow dry and style.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetology student, and one of our guest speakers was telling me about the brushes he uses and why. And this was one of them. I have seen his work and follow him on instagram. He is a rising star in the hair world, he has worked with top celebrity hairstylists, and has worked with a few celebrities himself. By following his tips and brushes he uses, I hope to be as good as him.</li>
    <li> Great brush, light weight!  Shipped quickly, love the brush.</li>
    <li> Great round brush gives a lot of body.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush! My hairdresser uses the same brand and highly recommended it! I bought two for blow drying. I wish there were more sizes</li>
    <li> I love it. Gives me lots of volume.</li>
    <li> Maybe I am using this brush incorrectly, but I&#x27;m not impressed. I have long, thick, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to spend $48 for a hair brush, but based on the other reviews I took a leap of faith and got it.  This is by far the best brush I have ever used for blow drying my hair.  It is lightweight, the cork handle offers great grip, the bristles really grab and hold the hair (great when you are styling yourself) and my hair comes out super shiny.  It is worth every penny and will last for years I am sure.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful! I never thought I could get so much from a hairbrush. I have very fine, dry, slightly curly hair that used to fall flat at the crown and frizz out toward the ends when styled with a standard round hairbrush from CVS. Now I have volume, bounce, shine, and no frizz. Worth the $!</li>
    <li> This brush deserves highest rating because it smooths my hair like none other.  As an African American woman I was uncertain about this type of brush for my hair.  But, I truly like how it makes my previously unmanageable hair lay down effortlessly!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  My hair is only shoulder length, so I was concerned that this brush would be too big.  But the long bristles grip my curly/wavy hair well and leaves it smooth and with lots of body.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive compared to other brushes, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> It had a bad odor and was rough in my hair.</li>
    <li> once I used it with the hot hair dryer every thing burned out. please dont spend your money on this .</li>
    <li> Best round brush I&#x27;ve ever had. Hair glides smoothly &amp; cork handle stays secure in the hand. Will purchase another to be sure I always have a backup. A great gift too.</li>
    <li> Really lovely brush! I&#x27;m glad I invested. I have very long and thick hair, and this brush is a savior when I blow dry. Slides through like butter and leaves my hair glossy :)</li>
