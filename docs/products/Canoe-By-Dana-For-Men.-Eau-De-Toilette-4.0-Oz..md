<li> This product was a little slow getting to me</li>
<li> Repetitive, yes, but it pleases him,and that is what I like.  </li>
<li> I have you in the past.</li>

    <li> Been using Canoe since the mid 60&#x27;s and it hasn&#x27;t changed. Still my favorite fragrance and still does not last long enough. This seller was great: good price and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Just as smooth as &amp;#34;back in the day.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product was a little slow getting to me but it was posted in the shipping. Very happy with over all purchase.</li>
    <li> Been one of my favorites for over 30 years, now!</li>
    <li> Exactly the same as the last Canoe toilette I bought which I still have a small amount.</li>
    <li> they have changed the formula..used to have a definite vanilla scent on top-and through the dry down..warm and slightly musky..its gone..it was the ingredient that gave it its character..its gone..and missed</li>
    <li> OLD SCHOOL COOLNESS!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this package very quick. When I got it it was leaking. The box was crushed then wrapped for shipment. I don&#x27;t think it was Canoe. It was supposed to be spray and I received splash.  Product may have been sitting around a long time. This was purchased at Best Price Depot.</li>
    <li> I have used Canoe aftershave and cologne and liked them very much.  I have used Canoe for decades.  I ordered Eau De Toilette but was not aware that it came in a spray bottle which makes it hard to use.  The other types come in screw cap bottles so one could drip a few drops in your palm and then splash it on your face.  When I ordered the product, the description made no mention of a spray mechanism.  I assumed aftershave, cologne and eau de toilette were just different strengths of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have been using Canoe since the early 50s, believe it or not.  The blend of spicy and sweet is perfect and it lasts better than expensive scents.  I recommend it to every one</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this cologne for a long time and still Loves it but,he is also in his sixties!</li>
    <li> I don,t think the fragrance is  exactly the same as the Canoe I have you in the past. Maybe my sniffers just getting old. Service was prompt and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have been using canoe since I was 16, I am now 71. Although many say I am behind the times, and should be using something more up to date, for some strange reason, I feel attached to the product.I must say , \\&quot;it ain&#x27;t what it used to be\\&quot;. In years past, people (especially the informed women) would comment, what are you wearing, it smells wonderful and sexy. Now, I haven&#x27;t received a comment in years. The product seems watered down, and \\&quot;lacking that aroma that made it sooo famous. The price is still there, but the quality is not. What did you do to you do to this once outstanding product?</li>
    <li> Well, this is the old standby for my husbands Christmas.  Repetitive, yes, but it pleases him,and that is what I like.  Thank you, ?Dana.  He always counts on Dana as a sort of old reliable. I cannot say I really like the fragrance, but I like it because it pleases him</li>
    <li> It is just what I expected.and wanted. (I am adding in these extra key strokes because without them the &amp;#34;submit&amp;#34; button would not activate.)</li>
    <li> Not the original and doesn&#x27;t smell like it....... word aword bword cword dword eword fword gword hword iword jword kword lword</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing Canoe since high school  Love this cologne on him.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. I&#x27;ve used this most of my life and I get compliments often that I smell good.</li>
    <li> Canoe is a powerful scent with multiple layers.  There is a hint of baby powder, however, tolerable. I distinguish earthy and sweet scents as well. I use this cologne most weekdays.</li>
    <li> The real thing, great smell, I love Canoe, been wearing it since I was 18, and I am now 68. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Same great product 50 years later.</li>
    <li> loved it in the 60&#x27;s, love it now.  The smell of Canoe brings back some fabulous memories, and they are all good.</li>
    <li> Was a present for my father &amp; of course he loves it</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this men&#x27;s cologne.  My favorite guy wears it, it&#x27;s wonderful and makes me very happy!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance at a marvelous price.  Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> A bit of nostalgia from the 60&#x27;s.  It us still good stuff.</li>
