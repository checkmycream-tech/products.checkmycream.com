      <li>without re-applying; I saw many complaints about this not having staying power.</li>
      <li>I wanted to like this as much as many of you.</li>
      <li>I prefer warmer, more exotic / spicier fragrances.  </li>
      <li>Love this scent.</li>
      <li>Tankyou ok</li>
      <li>es para mi amada esposa sexy muy bueno para ocaciones</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this perfume online because it was one of my favorites, but it&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore.</li>
      <li>It seems as if the more I wear it, the more I notice it</li>
      <li>Completely satisfied..</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Yes, I do smell the fruity melon- kind of a sweet honeydew melon?</li>
      <li>I like perfumes that smell sweet.. this one smells like you haven&#x27;t shower for years!</li>
      <li>not too strong.</li>
      <li>This perfume has a nice, fresh, clean scent.</li>
      <li>so I probably smelled nice to anyone I hadn&#x27;t been spending a significant amount of time with, but that just isn&#x27;t good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>perfect for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>I thought it smelled nice, but my husband thinks I smell too much like flowers.  </li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t think this is the original</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a going out, clubbing, or on a hot date type of scent.</li>
      <li>I liked it right off the bat, thought it was a very seductive, attention grabbing, and feminine scent.</li>
      <li>smells wonderful,definately would recommend it to someone looking for a sweet scent,not a fan of paris hilton</li>
      <li>If you like smells that are sweet</li>
      <li>Also, the perfume has amazing staying power - it doesn&#x27;t fade and it actually stays relatively strong throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>And I must be one lucky girl cause perfume lasts on me</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s size makes it perfect for travel, especially if you&#x27;re flying and only with carry on luggage.</li>
      <li>Excellent, A new and different product to be used personally, highly recommended to buy again in this store.</li>
      <li>Overall, not bad, but it&#x27;s always a good idea to test it on the person that sits next to you the most.</li>
      <li>But, for the brand and for what I paid, it was worth the $13 +</li>
      <li>Very much worth the money</li>
      <li>Very pleased, thank you expected.</li>
      <li>Actually, the scent made me feel like I should be sitting in a board meeting wearing a business suit, if that makes sense, so definitely appropriate to wear in the work place.</li>
      <li>I would say the appropriate age range for this perfume is probably 20-30, definitely night time, and not for the office.</li>
      <li>(I also ordered the Heiress perfume, *blush*).  </li>
      <li>It smells almost exactly like it.  </li>
      <li>It is light and everyone at work enjoys me being near.</li>
      <li>Men come running very animalistic!</li>
      <li>This is another first time buy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smaller than I though, probably smaller than your phone, but it smells really good nonetheless.</li>
      <li>but i certainly am a fan of this perfume</li>
      <li>And much cheaper than the store, if you can even find it.</li>
      <li>something you&#x27;d expect to smell on a younger girl (maybe high school, college, and mid-20s) because it reminds me of something super candy/girly/flirtatious.  </li>
      <li>Not really my style, as I prefer sweet scents, but pleasant enough none the less.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s VERY sweet, fruity, slightly floral, and on the cooler side - a spring or summer fragrance, and</li>
      <li>This perfume is basically a much cheaper version / imitation / knock-off of Ralph Lauren RALPH COOL.  </li>
      <li>I think in general, I am attracted to sweet, floral, aquatic, and woodsy scents, and this definitely hits all of those notes.</li>
      <li>The bottle&#x27;s design does not bother me, it&#x27;s a little cheap but who cares?</li>
      <li>People are always surprised when I tell them its Paris Hilton.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, when I sniffed my wrist hours later, it still smelled the same as when it was freshly applied</li>
      <li>I have to say - for someone who is such a train wreck, she did a decent job of making perfume</li>
      <li>Last all day soft scent</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe the smell in text, but it is definitely a lovely, young, fresh scent that rivals the victoria secret line.</li>
      <li>It is weak in smell and does not last more than an hour.</li>

<li> But then again you don&#x27;t expect something cost only $20 to be concentrated and long lasting at the same time.</li>
<li> Every single time I have worn this, it smells like melon mixed with ACETONE!</li>
<li> The scent doesnt stay too long.</li>
<li> I have seen other reviewers mention the chemical-ish smell.. spot on.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s less than the 3oz.</li>
<li> but, the the bottle of perfume was less tan</li>
<li> ;( the smell is too strong, I hate it.</li>
<li> I can carry this little bottle in my purse</li>
<li> But at least it smells like watered down real perfume rather than smell of fruit and berries in this bad perfume.</li>
<li> It came in one of her gift sets of 4 small mini&#x27;s.</li>
<li> I usually wear this when I&#x27;m going out with the ladies.</li>
<li> I made a blind purchase on this perfume based off the reviews on various sites, including this one.</li>
<li> For all I know, I was walking around smelling like I went swimming in the stuff, but I could only get a very faint whiff of it when I pressed my nose to my skin, even while it was still wet!</li>
<li> I swallowed my pride and had to order this perfume because of all the ridiculous rave reviews it received.  </li>
<li> My one real complaint is that after a while, I got so used to the scent that I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore, even when I reapplied it.</li>
<li> This is no perfume, rather some weird mix to produce weird smell.</li>
<li> However, occasionally I would feel like it was boring or too musky.</li>
<li> I just hate it.</li>

    <li> Got this for my girlfriend for Valentine&#x27;s day and it smells really good. It&#x27;s smaller than I though, probably smaller than your phone, but it smells really good nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome I can carry this little bottle in my purse</li>

    <li> I made a blind purchase on this perfume based off the reviews on various sites, including this one. I liked it right off the bat, thought it was a very seductive, attention grabbing, and feminine scent. However, occasionally I would feel like it was boring or too musky. Sometimes it smelled cheap, although it has good staying power. Since it&#x27;s the only perfume I have at the moment, I wear it everytime I go out, and I get a lot of compliments on it. People are always surprised when I tell them its Paris Hilton. It seems as if the more I wear it, the more I notice it and I have to say, it is growing on me. I think in general, I am attracted to sweet, floral, aquatic, and woodsy scents, and this definitely hits all of those notes. I would say the appropriate age range for this perfume is probably 20-30, definitely night time, and not for the office. It&#x27;s more of a going out, clubbing, or on a hot date type of scent. The bottle&#x27;s design does not bother me, it&#x27;s a little cheap but who cares?</li>
    <li> nice size. perfect to just throw in ur purse. smells great. not too strong. perfect for everyday wear. love the style of the bottle</li>

Actually, the scent made me feel like I should be sitting in a board meeting wearing a business suit, if that makes sense, so definitely appropriate to wear in the work place.

On the plus side, when I sniffed my wrist hours later, it still smelled the same as when it was freshly applied so I probably smelled nice to anyone I hadn&#x27;t been spending a significant amount of time with, but that just isn&#x27;t good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came with a set \\&quot;Paris Hilton Variety 5 Piece Mini Gift Set for Women\\&quot; http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N8I10YG/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 and I plan on reviewing each scent individually as I try them out.</li>
    <li> I swallowed my pride and had to order this perfume because of all the ridiculous rave reviews it received.  I can&#x27;t stand Paris Hilton but, the the bottle of perfume was less tan $15 so I figured, WTH.  I have to say - for someone who is such a train wreck, she did a decent job of making perfume (I also ordered the Heiress perfume, *blush*).  This perfume is basically a much cheaper version / imitation / knock-off of Ralph Lauren RALPH COOL.  It smells almost exactly like it.  It&#x27;s VERY sweet, fruity, slightly floral, and on the cooler side - a spring or summer fragrance, and something you&#x27;d expect to smell on a younger girl (maybe high school, college, and mid-20s) because it reminds me of something super candy/girly/flirtatious.  It&#x27;s definitely not my cup of tea - I prefer warmer, more exotic / spicier fragrances.  But, for the brand and for what I paid, it was worth the $13 + change [I definitely would not have paid than $15 for it].  Also, the perfume has amazing staying power - it doesn&#x27;t fade and it actually stays relatively strong throughout the day.  A pleasant surprise for a cheap perfume.  :)</li>
    <li> This is another first time buy and it was a good pick. It is light and everyone at work enjoys me being near. Very much worth the money</li>
    <li> I love this beautiful sweet scent and get many compliments on it!  A couple of my friends now wear it too.  It&#x27; not overpowering or too sweet but perfect and fresh.  I hope they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> Excellent, A new and different product to be used personally, highly recommended to buy again in this store. Tankyou ok</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this perfume online because it was one of my favorites, but it&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore. It smells AMAZING and I never have to worry about someone wearing the same perfume as me. It&#x27;s size makes it perfect for travel, especially if you&#x27;re flying and only with carry on luggage. It&#x27;s less than the 3oz. limit so you don&#x27;t have to worry about TSA trashing it.</li>
    <li> A very nice and sensual cologne plus its at a great price I would definatly recommend it  to anyone who likes the brand</li>
    <li> Last all day soft scent</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think this is the original, it sorta smells like the paris hilton perfume.. The scent doesnt stay too long. you have to continue reapplying.</li>
    <li> Excellent, 100% Recomended</li>
    <li> I have no idea why people are saying this doesn&#x27;t smell like what you would buy in the store. It&#x27;s exactly same. Completely satisfied..And much cheaper than the store, if you can even find it. Arrived quickly. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, better then knock offs</li>
    <li> I thought it smelled nice, but my husband thinks I smell too much like flowers.  Overall, not bad, but it&#x27;s always a good idea to test it on the person that sits next to you the most.</li>
    <li> One of my problems with a lot of perfumes is that they smell great when you put them on, and then you and no one else can smell them the rest of the day. I get compliments on how good I smell when I wear this! It&#x27;s hard to describe the smell in text, but it is definitely a lovely, young, fresh scent that rivals the victoria secret line.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful,definately would recommend it to someone looking for a sweet scent,not a fan of paris hilton but i certainly am a fan of this perfume</li>
    <li> es para mi amada esposa sexy muy bueno para ocaciones especiales y reuniones con la familia un aroma a f</li>
    <li> Very pleased, thank you expected.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this as much as many of you. Yes, I do smell the fruity melon- kind of a sweet honeydew melon? Every single time I have worn this, it smells like melon mixed with ACETONE! Like nail polish remover! STRONGLY! I have seen other reviewers mention the chemical-ish smell.. spot on. I just hate it. And I must be one lucky girl cause perfume lasts on me ALL DAY- any kind- without re-applying; I saw many complaints about this not having staying power. Well i wish it wore off me sooner, ugh. It came in one of her gift sets of 4 small mini&#x27;s. i LOVE heiress, can can, and siren. Actually bought all of those in larger bottles. Self titled can... rot. Gross.</li>
    <li> I like perfumes that smell sweet.. this one smells like you haven&#x27;t shower for years! ;( the smell is too strong, I hate it. If you like smells that are sweet this is NOT for you.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. I buy it all the time. But this time I got it cheaper here than in the stores.</li>
    <li> Men come running very animalistic!</li>
    <li> This is no perfume, rather some weird mix to produce weird smell. Save your money for Can Can by Paris Hilton. It is weak in smell and does not last more than an hour. But then again you don&#x27;t expect something cost only $20 to be concentrated and long lasting at the same time. But at least it smells like watered down real perfume rather than smell of fruit and berries in this bad perfume. Save your money for can can and wonderstruck by Taylor Swift</li>
    <li> Nice fruity smell wife loves it</li>
