      <li>However, I can&#x27;t get it in the UK any more</li>
      <li>love this hair moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any sort of chemical</li>
      <li>Even better used on hair that&#x27;s not washed.</li>
      <li>I have just ordered more, so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>This thing makes my hair look thicker AND more manageable.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re also using the shampoo and conditioner that way you can get the most out of the product..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for awhile and the price was ok.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m allergic to scents and it leaves a nice light scent, not some stinky strong smell like some leave-in conditions do.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and it does a great job of keeping my curls soft and well-defined.</li>
      <li>is like that of aloe vera gel, so it&#x27;s easy to rinse off of my hands and out of my hair.</li>
      <li>It is a good product if u have light hair and not so much of it.</li>
      <li>This product has a strong perfume smell to it.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or feel sticky, which is awesome.  </li>
      <li>My hair look great even on third day after washing.</li>
      <li>This is no longer available at stores</li>
      <li>Now she wants her own....</li>
      <li>Wish it was available in uk/Ireland.  </li>
      <li>The best product I have ever used to tame my unruly hair.</li>
      <li>-but I&#x27;m worth it!</li>
      <li>My hair gets really dry and this product make a great difference.</li>
      <li>I still get fly aways on top, but very slightly.</li>
      <li>Most of the older reviews give this item high marks and a lot mention the nice smell.</li>
      <li>Good product and would use in the future</li>
      <li>My hair tends to mat after a night&#x27;s sleep, and this helps keep the mats at bay, a tremendous bonus.  </li>
      <li>For my fine wavy hair it just made it straight and smelly.</li>
      <li>It was for a little girl to control fly aways from a ponytail.</li>
      <li>well worth it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product not only leaves hair soft and sleek it smells great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously since high school (about 8 years), and I have nothing but good things to say about</li>
      <li>and then just fluff it out with my fingers, which results in nice defined curls.</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the smell or</li>
      <li>Watery and smells funny.</li>
      <li>I love this item, the only problem is the cost.  </li>
      <li>One thing that I&#x27;m not so sure about is the price, some suppliers charge almost double than others.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it again despite the extra cost</li>
      <li>On top of all of that, it puts moisture back into your hair.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years, It makes my naturally curly hair frizz free and helps detangle in the morning</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best use is on Towel dried hair and you don&#x27;t have to dry it.</li>
      <li>I got this for my husband and he liked it really well compared to some other products like this, he has very curly hair</li>
      <li>live in the desert and need a powerful hair moisturizer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not wrong, TIGI has discontinued this particular bottle, and is now selling http://www.amazon.com/Catwalk-Collection-Curlesque-Leave--Conditioner/dp/B003ABIDAA/</li>
      <li>My hair is straight for appx 2-3 inches from my scalp, then the curls start.</li>
      <li>I apply the leave-in moisturizer to my hair when is still wet and the curls look much better</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it would work on hair that is naturally straight.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing else quite like it for very curly hair.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend this much again.</li>
      <li>Along with the companion shampoo, this moisturizer makes my somewhat curly but very fine and thin hair keep it&#x27;s curls, stay soft, and become rather nice to live with.</li>
      <li>But this particular version of their product made my hair straight</li>
      <li>I used Curls Rock in the past and really liked it.</li>
      <li>If I ever feel my hair is frizzy, I use 1/2-1 additional pump on my dry hair to smooth it</li>
      <li>Easy to work into wet hair and defines curls as it dries.</li>
      <li>I am in Aus and Delivery is high, but</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>how sticky it was (I wasn&#x27;t a big cosmetics fan when this was recommended to me), but having grown and adapted, my reaction to it now is pretty much: &amp;#34;Meh.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use too much of the product and have my hair feel heavy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works great ! Thank You</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over 7 years. Great leaven conditioner and to styling curly, or wavy hair. I read some reviews saying it is not the same product as it use to be, maybe it was little different but I don&#x27;t recall that. It has been working for me, and continues to work as is. One thing that I&#x27;m not so sure about is the price, some suppliers charge almost double than others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before from a salon and it&#x27;s great. However, this is not the same product. It was a different color and had a bad odor to it. Definitely NOT the same product. I returned it and will not purchases again online. Save yourself the time from having to send it back.</li>
    <li> works great on my curly hair</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Not too fond of the smell either. I found that the Catwalk Mousse works/does the trick for my  hair.</li>
    <li> Along with the companion shampoo, this moisturizer makes my somewhat curly but very fine and thin hair keep it&#x27;s curls, stay soft, and become rather nice to live with. See my shampoo review for more adjectives. It&#x27;s really good stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic, does not goop up my hair or weigh down, been looking for this for years after my intial buying of one.</li>
    <li> I am always afraid to try new products, but I was super pleased with how this leaves my super curly, unruly hair. It works well as a leave in conditioner, and works really nice the next day when you want to just wet your hair and give it a little scrunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a nice job to control the frizz and I like how it helped to define my girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely going to order this product again!</li>
    <li> This is not the product I was looking for, It smelled so bad that I can&#x27;t use it. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> Been using this on curls for years, nothing tops it...not too stiff, stays feeling soft, defines and holds all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. At first I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the smell or how sticky it was (I wasn&#x27;t a big cosmetics fan when this was recommended to me), but having grown and adapted, my reaction to it now is pretty much: &amp;#34;Meh. It&#x27;s good, and it gets the job done.&amp;#34; I love the name, though.</li>
    <li> Wanted to find something that will moisturize dry, shoulder length layered grey hair with a wave in it. This product seems to do the trick and even helps my hair to hold a curl better when set on rollers. Unfortunately, I am allergic to the fragrance in many products and this one has a STRONG fragrance. I will use it sparingly when needed but will probably look for something else to replace it.</li>
    <li> Great product but still searching for the perfect one!  Works well, I just like hair to look soft not scrunchy.</li>
    <li> It works well with my hair. It keeps it bouncy. best product for my curly hair to moisturize and prevent frizz.</li>
    <li> Not especially a great product. Average quality. It is very thin and an odd blue color.&lt;br /&gt;Makes the hair a little less frizzy but I wouldn&#x27;t use it alone as a styling product.  Hair isn&#x27;t any softer.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This is the nicest leave-in moisturizer I&#x27;ve come across. I use it every day, and have relegated my other hair products to the closet. I have long, loosely curled hair, and I&#x27;ve had many compliments since I started using this.  It leaves my curls shiny and sleek. I let my hair air dry and then just fluff it out with my fingers, which results in nice defined curls. My hair tends to mat after a night&#x27;s sleep, and this helps keep the mats at bay, a tremendous bonus.  I like that it is not oily. It&#x27;s consistency is like that of aloe vera gel, so it&#x27;s easy to rinse off of my hands and out of my hair. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for my curly hair. I not only have to use a rinse out condition, I also have to have a leave in condition. My hair gets really dry and this product make a great difference. It smells good too. I definitely recommed it.</li>
    <li> I had a bottle of this for over two years and finally needed to replace it. So I ordered it on amazon, and the new bottle arrived leaking for one. It was really poorly packaged. Then 5 months later the stuff started to grow orange colored mold stuff inside the bottle. So I tossed it. My old bottle from Fred Meyer&#x27;s never did that in the years I had it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously since high school (about 8 years), and I have nothing but good things to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue in your hair. No sticky gel leftovers, so greasy feel, just the natural softness that your hair possesses. I have very long hair, and I use about 3 pumps of this after I get out of the shower. If I ever feel my hair is frizzy, I use 1/2-1 additional pump on my dry hair to smooth it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this smells wonderful. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any sort of chemical scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it! if you have shorter hair, obviously use less to prevent greasiness. If you have longer hair, make sure to focus on the ends. This doesn&#x27;t help much if you already have split ends, but it will help prevent them occurring in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very sticky and it smells a little funky, but my hair is left moisturized after I use it. I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re also using the shampoo and conditioner that way you can get the most out of the product..</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, It makes my naturally curly hair frizz free and helps detangle in the morning</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful, but I haven&#x27;t got a good one in some time. The last three that I&#x27;ve gotten from Amazon have smelled like they went bad. They worked as expected, but the smell was truly awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m not wrong, TIGI has discontinued this particular bottle, and is now selling http://www.amazon.com/Catwalk-Collection-Curlesque-Leave--Conditioner/dp/B003ABIDAA/</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters who have curly hair. I chose this product because I could get it through subscribe &amp; save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very thin and doesn&#x27;t do anything for their hair. Their hair feels dry, not moisturized.  Their hair gets a lot of knots when we use it, and we try very hard not to cause tangles when we wash their hair.</li>
    <li> Its okay but I&#x27;ve used better.  I&#x27;m going to try it again in the spring when its warmer. But if you like the curly look it will do that for you, if you already have hair prone to curl. I don&#x27;t know how it would work on hair that is naturally straight.</li>
    <li> Not great at all! I did not notice a difference:( I hate I wasted my money on this product. Does not help hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is Awesome!!!! This is no longer available at stores and I really hope cat walk brings it back! But until then I&#x27;m very glad that it&#x27;s availBle on amazon😊</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he liked it really well compared to some other products like this, he has very curly hair and it gets dry and this did the trick.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Softens curls and isn&#x27;t thick. Wish it was available in uk/Ireland.  Even better used on hair that&#x27;s not washed.</li>
    <li> This product not only leaves hair soft and sleek it smells great. Just need to use a very small amount and comb thru hair for all day extra conditioning.</li>
    <li> I would definitely suggest this product for people with curly unruly hair! Leaves hair silky and soft with out frizz- Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my hair. I have somewhat wavy hair that I usually blow dry. But this product has saved me lots of time as I can just put in some of it on my hair after I shower and not worry about frizzy hair later on throughout the day. If you hair is not too curly, you could make it extermely curly by using a combination of the leave-in moisturizer and Tigi curl amlifier. You&#x27;ll be amazed how curly your hair will get!</li>
    <li> The product is very good, I love TIGI CAT WALK!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this specific product for the first time, and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;The product helps curly hairs, to define the curly.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this on my naturally curly hair and I have found that my curls are much more defined and healthy!</li>
    <li> This is a great detangler and it holds my curl all day.  It helps keep it defined although there&#x27;s room for improvement in that area.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or feel sticky, which is awesome.  I don&#x27;t like the smell but once it&#x27;s in my hair I don&#x27;t notice it.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for awhile and the price was ok.</li>
    <li> Good product and would use in the future</li>
    <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m VERY disappointed that it&#x27;s been discontinued.  Leaves my curls soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I love this.  My curly hair is totally tamed by it.  I use it along with Loreal Professional mousse.  It took me about 9 months to use this up, using 1 pump a day, about every other day.</li>
    <li> Great for permed hair that is very fine textured.  This is not heavy and let&#x27;s me run a comb through before drying.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and have not found anything that works as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. There&#x27;s nothing else quite like it for very curly hair. However, I can&#x27;t get it in the UK any more so I have to buy it from amazon.com. I wish they&#x27;d start selling it in the UK again.</li>
    <li> waste of money -doesnt do anything</li>
    <li> UGH idk about this. It was for a little girl to control fly aways from a ponytail. Maybe I was looking for something stronger. It is a good product if u have light hair and not so much of it. Watery and smells funny.</li>
    <li> Out of the shower and towel dry and I use Curls Rock and it is perfect texture as it dries! I have always used this as it is also a moisturizer to!</li>
    <li> Pro:  Good smell&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Slimy feel, makes my neck break out, did not like the way it made my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Work great for my curly hair.  Keeps it soft and manageable all day............not dry and out of control like it used to be.</li>
    <li> Wish I had read the one star comments before purchasing this product....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased it before from salons and the product is prefect. Great smell and leave the hair light a wavy. However, after three months of having one from this supplier at home, the colour had changed and it had a horrible odor. Certainly the products being sold must have past their expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to dispose the bottle and will not purchase from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, and I love that Amazon still has it.  I do wonder however how old it is because they took it out of stores a long time ago and changed the formula.  It&#x27;s light and it does a great job of keeping my curls soft and well-defined.</li>
    <li> love this hair moisturizer. use it everyday.  live in the desert and need a powerful hair moisturizer and this is the one.</li>
    <li> Nice product, but not nice enough for the price.  I wouldn&#x27;t spend this much again.</li>
    <li> Did not live up to the reviews for helping with moisture and curl. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> I love this item, the only problem is the cost.  It curls my hair and my hair looks great.  If you don&#x27;t care about the cost, buy this item.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a Curl defining Leave In Moisturiser, AND I HAVE FOUND IT. My hair is straight for appx 2-3 inches from my scalp, then the curls start. Frizz in any weather, but as we all know particularly in cold weather. I use 3-4 pumps of this and my hair tames 85%. I still get fly aways on top, but very slightly. It&#x27;s best use is on Towel dried hair and you don&#x27;t have to dry it. It does not leave your hair looking wet. Plus you can use it on Dry hair and it tames the frizz and defines curls. On top of all of that, it puts moisture back into your hair. I haven&#x27;t had my hair cut in 2 yrs, it even help with split ends. The best product I have ever used to tame my unruly hair. My hair is fine, but I have alot of it! My 12yr old daughter tried it and was in awe. She hates having her hair brushed, I put some of this in it and the brush went straight through it. Now she wants her own.... Highly recommend. I am in Aus and Delivery is high, but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE;  I have now been using this for one month now, have coloured my hair in that time and am still delighted with it. I have just ordered more, so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> For me this product works wonders on wet or dry hair; it keeps my curls tamed, defined and feeling soft. I&#x27;m now getting compliments again! Why it was taken off the shelves has exasperated me, tried alternative products but this is the best. So glad I found it again despite the extra cost-but I&#x27;m worth it!</li>
    <li> Disappointed. I used Curls Rock in the past and really liked it. But this particular version of their product made my hair straight (I have fine thin wavy hair).  The product I used before inhanced the curl while removing the frizz. This one just made it limp and lifeless. If I used less product it didn&#x27;t really make any difference at all, still frizzy, if I use enough to remove the frizz, it&#x27;s totally straight.  The other problem is the smell. This product has a strong perfume smell to it.  Some may like that smell, but if I wanted perfume I would buy perfume not hair products.  So if you have thick REALLY curly hair, this might help relax it a little (maybe) while controlling some of the frizz,  if you don&#x27;t mind the perfume smell. For my fine wavy hair it just made it straight and smelly.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works great, I&#x27;m allergic to scents and it leaves a nice light scent, not some stinky strong smell like some leave-in conditions do.  And it has traveled all over the world with me and leaves my curls soft and managable in any weather conditions.</li>
    <li> There moisturizer had a really terrible odor to it.  Tried to get some help with customer service but was not able to find someone to talk to about it.  Won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This thing makes my hair look thicker AND more manageable. Plus a nice smell. My hair look great even on third day after washing. Never could achieve that with other products.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this item has been discontinued, which could explain why I got a rank bottle in my order. I came online to recheck the reviews and it seems as though the newest review had a similar problem. Most of the older reviews give this item high marks and a lot mention the nice smell. Mine smelled like mildew. Really disappointed because I had high hopes. I have contacted Amazon to process a return/refund.</li>
    <li> Great price; speedy delivery</li>
    <li> I love this product because it allows me to leave in the conditioner and I can use it every day.</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly and when I do not blow dry it and I want to keep the curls I apply the leave-in moisturizer to my hair when is still wet and the curls look much better</li>
    <li> The wife loves it.  Says it makes her hair look blow dried even though she air dries it. (no idea what that means but she said the women would understand)</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel so soft!,  I use it under my gel to spike my hair and just love it!</li>
    <li> Easy to work into wet hair and defines curls as it dries.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use too much of the product and have my hair feel heavy.</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner out there. This product helps tame frizz, doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue and smells reasonable.</li>
