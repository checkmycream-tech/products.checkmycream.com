      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I have a ton of very fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have very fine wavy hair.</li>
      <li>and it is easy to spray at the roots and work through for a nice lift.</li>
      <li>It gives me more volume.</li>
      <li>(most often).  </li>
      <li>I can get fabulous volume!</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>This is my favorite volumizing spary and I have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>I love the texture and volume it gives.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this root booster.</li>
      <li>As I increased the amount of product, the hold was better, but no increase in volume.  </li>
      <li>I love big sexy hair products and have FOREVER!!!</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and quite honestly, until you try other products in comparison</li>
      <li>This is a light hairspray that hold your hair in place and you can spray it and style it after.</li>
      <li>I use this on a daily basis, it provides great volume, without stiffness or stickiness.</li>
      <li>It also really helps me if I decide to backcomb my hair, it helps hold it a lot better, rather than just using hairspray....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been in love with that &#x27;big and sexy bed head look&#x27; ever since the 80&#x27;s</li>
      <li>This volumizer is even better than the Big Sexy Hair Root Pump.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay product and does pretty much what it says it will...</li>
      <li>And when you&#x27;re talking about hair in the south, big is sexy!</li>
      <li>the first day--nothing!</li>
      <li>I went to a popular grocery store, and they were selling the same exact thing, (size and everything), for 19.99!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and fluffy, and you don&#x27;t need to do a full blowout to enjoy the volume, even though it does get better with a full blowout.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like one of those cheap hairspray that is very sticky and greasy looking except this is in mousse form.</li>
      <li>it still keeps to its word &amp; is worth the price.</li>
      <li>(Popular grocery store total with tax-$21.19.  </li>
      <li>and if you are just wanting some natural healthy looking volume just use this with your blow dryer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a magic potion, but it does work better than most of the root lifters I have tried over the years.</li>
      <li>cause the bottle is that, BIG. :)</li>
      <li>and it came exactly as shown.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I think it looks even better on the second day.</li>
      <li>But the Big Sexy Hair brand is a reliable brand, so I don&#x27;t doubt this won&#x27;t do</li>
      <li>and I am ready to rock!</li>
      <li>The longest one up until now lasted a whole 5 minutes!</li>
      <li>It gave my hair a lot of volume, and held pretty well.</li>
      <li>It was a can of Big Sexy Hair Volumizer...</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this stuff is the next day.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much, however, or your hair will feel sticky!</li>
      <li>it gives your hair decent volume, but leaves it kind of sticky and wet looking.  </li>
      <li>Most of the stuff either left my hair SUPER dry or SUPER stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Fueled by desperation and the mindset of having nothing else to loose, I took the advice of my hair dresser and purchased yet another product I was sure would disappoint.  </li>
      <li>It goes directly where I want it and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>I live in the Southeast, one of the most humid areas in the US, you literally feel like there&#x27;s a film over you when you step outside!  </li>
      <li>Make sure you blow dry very well after using it.  </li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t seem to distinguish that fine line between having big hair and having BIIIIGGG hair.</li>
      <li>I have short, fine hair and this really helps give it volume.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>(really fast shipping.)</li>
      <li>I really like that I don&#x27;t have to use much of the stuff to achieve my desired results, too.</li>
      <li>The volume at my roots is visible and lasts longer than most other brands.</li>
      <li>I have extremely thin fine hair &amp; found that even with my personal use away from the magical hand of the stylist I was able to get the same effect.</li>
      <li>The hold was decent, not sticky</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Have to be careful not to overdo it though, or your hair will get sticky and gritty and you will not be able to do a thing with it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s effective in terms of giving my roots a bit of lift help, but I don&#x27;t like that even a little bit of it causes a dry look.  </li>
      <li>A friend recommended this product as my hair is very fine and thin, and I was complaining of not having much volume.</li>
      <li>Use it correctly though and blow dry hair right after to blow the roots up, this holds them</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and don&#x27;t like a heavy hair spray.</li>
      <li>I spray it directly onto the areas I need it and work it in with my fingers.</li>
      <li>I always get compliments on my hair from people I know as well as complete strangers.  </li>
      <li>Have tried other top-named products, but keep going back to Big Sexy Hair.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased this product in a salon in Ky after getting my haircut, when the woman used this to get some volume out of my otherwise limp locks.</li>
      <li>Like many other posters, I live in the Southeast, so humidity is an everyday occurence.</li>
      <li>I have blond, thin, baby fine hair and live in MN (HUMID in the summer!!).  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky (as long as you don&#x27;t use too much) or greasy on your hair.</li>
      <li>Gives me so much volume; normally my hair is straight and very limp.</li>
      <li>For the better part of my adolescence and early adulthood, life pretty much consisted of one bad hair day after another...</li>
      <li>A quick blow dry and some dry shampoo</li>
      <li>Nothing major, though, and nothing shampooing with baking soda won&#x27;t fix.</li>
      <li>A little advice: be sure to shake extremely well before applying to hair.  </li>
      <li>I spray a line in various roots &amp; comb it through my half-wet/damp hair, blow dry with a large round brush &amp; presto, straight manageable hair with just enough lift &amp; when it&#x27;s rainy or hot</li>
      <li>This product makes styling thin, silky hair a breeze as it allows more managability and shape that will stay.</li>
      <li>no heavy, dragged down flat look;)</li>
      <li>Rub, then finish blow-drying with a large round brush.</li>

    <li> I originally purchased this product in a salon in Ky after getting my haircut, when the woman used this to get some volume out of my otherwise limp locks. I have extremely thin fine hair &amp; found that even with my personal use away from the magical hand of the stylist I was able to get the same effect. I spray a line in various roots &amp; comb it through my half-wet/damp hair, blow dry with a large round brush &amp; presto, straight manageable hair with just enough lift &amp; when it&#x27;s rainy or hot it still keeps to its word &amp; is worth the price. Remember a little goes a long way too. Not sticky or gummy. I just wish they had a travel size cause the bottle is that, BIG. :)</li>
    <li> This volumizer is even better than the Big Sexy Hair Root Pump.  I live in the Southeast, one of the most humid areas in the US, you literally feel like there&#x27;s a film over you when you step outside!  This hair spray holds up quite well against the humidity, and smells really good too.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a lift.</li>
    <li> My hair is mid-back long and color treated for YEARS. I always get compliments on my hair from people I know as well as complete strangers.  Have tried other top-named products, but keep going back to Big Sexy Hair.  It goes directly where I want it and absorbs quickly.  I let it dry naturally as well as blow dry (most often).  It works either way...no heavy, dragged down flat look;)</li>
    <li> This hairspray does not hold up in the humidity.</li>
    <li> I use this on a daily basis, it provides great volume, without stiffness or stickiness. I don&#x27;t like feeling like I have a bunch of products in my hair and this mousse is very lightweight but still gets the job done, even if you have very long, heavy hair.</li>
    <li> The hold was decent, not sticky and I could still get my hands or a brush through it, but I did not see an increase in volume.  As I increased the amount of product, the hold was better, but no increase in volume.  I have blond, thin, baby fine hair and live in MN (HUMID in the summer!!).  Oh well, the search will continue....</li>
    <li> I think this product is a bit drying on the hair.  It&#x27;s effective in terms of giving my roots a bit of lift help, but I don&#x27;t like that even a little bit of it causes a dry look.  Will finish this one but will purchase something else in the future.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on...sunday, the 13. It just came today in the mail (really fast shipping.) I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I got this orginally because I wanted to create a wavy/curly hairstyle like Snooki and found out how to. I went to a popular grocery store, and they were selling the same exact thing, (size and everything), for 19.99! When you do the math, using my states sales tax (6%, or .06), I saved $6.78! (Popular grocery store total with tax-$21.19.  Online total including tax- $14.41) I gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t tried out the product. But the Big Sexy Hair brand is a reliable brand, so I don&#x27;t doubt this won&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I like how it sprays evenly on your head rather than getting a big messy clump of mousse in your hands. It gave my hair a lot of volume, and held pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky (as long as you don&#x27;t use too much) or greasy on your hair. I have used mousse that leaves kinda like a film on your hair, this doesn&#x27;t do that at all. It feels lightweight and just creates like a bouncy volume. It also really helps me if I decide to backcomb my hair, it helps hold it a lot better, rather than just using hairspray....and if you are just wanting some natural healthy looking volume just use this with your blow dryer. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried what seems like a zillion root-booting type products from sprays to mousses to lord knows what. Some of them worked-- for about 30 seconds. The longest one up until now lasted a whole 5 minutes! THIS stuff, it lasts ALL day long . . .  and all of the next day too. I can get fabulous volume! I have a ton of very fine hair. I lift the hair, spray a line at the roots, repeat until I&#x27;ve done a few lines in strategically placed areas. Rub, then finish blow-drying with a large round brush. My favorite thing about this stuff is the next day. I only shampoo every other day. I get up, I use the blow-dryer and round brush to re-style my hair and I&#x27;m done! Amazing! Sometimes I think it looks even better on the second day.</li>
    <li> This product makes styling thin, silky hair a breeze as it allows more managability and shape that will stay.</li>
    <li> Although, it does volumize the hair but this product is STICKY!!! Also, after putting this product on, it&#x27;s hard to manage/style my hair because all my hair will be stuck to one another. It&#x27;s like one of those cheap hairspray that is very sticky and greasy looking except this is in mousse form. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw I have very fine wavy hair.</li>
    <li> For the better part of my adolescence and early adulthood, life pretty much consisted of one bad hair day after another... I&#x27;ve always been in love with that &#x27;big and sexy bed head look&#x27; ever since the 80&#x27;s but I couldn&#x27;t seem to distinguish that fine line between having big hair and having BIIIIGGG hair. Granted at the time my tools were an electric crimper and about half-a-can of Aqua Net -what can I say, we&#x27;ve all had our fair share of fashion do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts!  I&#x27;ve tried every magazine recommendation, salon product, homemade solution, shampoo, spray, etc. that&#x27;s out there.  Most of the stuff either left my hair SUPER dry or SUPER stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Fueled by desperation and the mindset of having nothing else to loose, I took the advice of my hair dresser and purchased yet another product I was sure would disappoint.  It was a can of Big Sexy Hair Volumizer...my search had finally ended.  This stuff is AWESOME!  A little advice: be sure to shake extremely well before applying to hair.  Just a few sprays massaged into the scalp prior to blow drying is all it takes in order to give flat locks a little lift.  Don&#x27;t use too much, however, or your hair will feel sticky!</li>
    <li> after reading reviews seeing my roommates all using this product i gave it a try. the first day--nothing! the second day my hair was so stiff i couldn&#x27;t brush through it. i had to wash my hair immediately before leaving for work. not only that i had to use a lot of conditioner which then made my hair very very limp. i have never ever returned a product before but this will be going back tomorrow    i have thin, straight hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this root booster. It works wonders on my bleached hair. I love the texture and volume it gives. Have to be careful not to overdo it though, or your hair will get sticky and gritty and you will not be able to do a thing with it. I usually use it after I towel dry my hair. I spray it directly onto the areas I need it and work it in with my fingers. I comb it through too, because I like having some grip and texture throughout my hair. A quick blow dry and some dry shampoo and I am ready to rock! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love big sexy hair products and have FOREVER!!! they are one of the only volumizing products that I will actually dish out the money to use. My hair is thin flat and boring, this brings it to life.</li>
    <li> This is the best volumizer that&#x27;s out there! I use very little and it works very big! And when you&#x27;re talking about hair in the south, big is sexy! It also keeps volume through Houston humidity which if you&#x27;ve ever experienced it you would know its a miracle!</li>
    <li> Hard to say if it made a difference with my hair. I suppose it did add volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and don&#x27;t like a heavy hair spray. This is a light hairspray that hold your hair in place and you can spray it and style it after.</li>
    <li> Works perfect even in the hot humid summer</li>
    <li> This is my favorite volumizing spary and I have been using it for years. I couldnt find it cheaper anywhere else and it came exactly as shown. Loved it and already started using it</li>
    <li> A great product, recommended by my stylist. Like many other posters, I live in the Southeast, so humidity is an everyday occurence. With Root Pump Plus, my style stands a lot more than a fighting chance against the weather! Gives me so much volume; normally my hair is straight and very limp. I really like that I don&#x27;t have to use much of the stuff to achieve my desired results, too. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because when it dries and you run your fingers or a brush through your hair, it feels like there is a bit of build up on the scalp. Nothing major, though, and nothing shampooing with baking soda won&#x27;t fix. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought the wrong product but decided to keep it. I don&#x27;t like the smell and makes my hair very stiff.</li>
    <li> Lifts my roots up!! Without making them greasy or stiff. It gives me more volume. Use it correctly though and blow dry hair right after to blow the roots up, this holds them</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LOVES IT.....</li>
    <li> My sister told me about this and, of course, I had to try it. I have short, fine hair and this really helps give it volume. I just spray a few times, rub into the roots and blow dry. Does wonders for limp hair.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product as my hair is very fine and thin, and I was complaining of not having much volume. It&#x27;s not a magic potion, but it does work better than most of the root lifters I have tried over the years. The volume at my roots is visible and lasts longer than most other brands.</li>
    <li> Oh god absolutely loved the volume this product gave my hair. Bravo! Bravo!</li>
    <li> I like the root pump because it helps to add body without being heavy. I have longer hair and it is easy to spray at the roots and work through for a nice lift.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It&#x27;s light and fluffy, and you don&#x27;t need to do a full blowout to enjoy the volume, even though it does get better with a full blowout.  It smells wonderful and quite honestly, until you try other products in comparison, you don&#x27;t quite realize how great this  product is.  it also is big and gives you quite a bit of product.  Best of all, they don&#x27;t test on animals :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product and does pretty much what it says it will... it gives your hair decent volume, but leaves it kind of sticky and wet looking.  Make sure you blow dry very well after using it.  Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I received this item the other day. It was packaged very good so I know the damage didnt happen in the shipping . Also I received it in a timely manner. My problem is the stuff wont work. It wont pump at all. I am so upset!</li>
    <li> This product is really great! Helps to add thickness and body to my thin curly hair!  LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WILL KEEP BUYING IT!</li>
