    <li> It did take a while to get here but it was worth the wait-- and the really cool envelope from china. It was the perfect birthday gift for a teenage girl who really needed a new &amp;#34;computer&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I like it for my purse. It&#x27;s just so clever.What more can I say, it&#x27;s a mirror for heavens sake.</li>
    <li> This is cute! I have Apple everything so when I saw this, I naturally had to get it even though I didn&#x27;t need it :)</li>
    <li> for my grandaughter she loved it</li>
    <li> Love it!! It&#x27;s well made and looks authentic. Good size, slim enough to slide in pocket or purse.</li>
    <li> Item was in great condition the box it came in was in decent condition. So pretty good overall. I gave it 3 stars because it&#x27;s a gift and presentation means quite a bit for me.</li>
    <li> love it great 4 ag dolls</li>
    <li> Apple lovers would love this super cute item.......bought for my nieces that have a MacBook and they LOVED it!</li>
    <li> The mirror came detached, but it&#x27;s mendable. The paint was also a bit chipped on the keyboard. It was an ok buy.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend the seller!!!  Quickly received and love the items!!!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This design is very creative, they paid such close attention to detail they included the usb and earphone &amp;#34;hook-up&amp;#34; holes on the sides! Awesome to own just for the novelty of it!&lt;br /&gt;1 word of caution, this took over 2 months to arrive to me, keep this in mind when ordering for a particular occasion!</li>
    <li> Great little mirror.  I got it to go with my American Girl Dolls.  It&#x27;s just the right size.</li>
    <li> Great looking mirror. It&#x27;s a little small but I like the concept behind it (the crave for anything Mac). It kept my children and I laughing all day.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daughters AG Dolls and Dollhouse. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought</li>
    <li> This tiny mirror is very cute :) I couldn&#x27;t imagine that it would be so great. I Definitely recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> OMG i gave this to my sister as a gift and it is really cute</li>
    <li> It was broken and it just no it was horrifying this sucks and the bag was dirty and wet just no</li>
    <li> (This is actually a 4 star product, but I put it at one star so that when people read the reviews they will see mine.) It would be a five but the mirror has difficulty staying at a 90 degree angle, it CONSTANTLY FLIPS ALL THE WAY BACK til it&#x27;s flat. And the &amp;#34;TRACK-PAD&amp;#34; HAS the letters &amp;#34;OSA ON IT&amp;#34; instead of it being blank like the picture says.</li>
    <li> This is one of the goofiest gifts you can give. I wrapped it in a real iPad box and my family will never trust me again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this bc it&#x27;s way different  and unique. It came on time (takes 3-4 weeks) it was packaged well. Worth the wait. And my mom loved it. So 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I got one for each of my daughters, and I&#x27;ve always wanted to sneak one back because it&#x27;s so cute and so faithful a reproduction of my own laptop.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for her American Girl. Very cute! However, the mirror is not even attached!  So I guess I&#x27;ll have to super glue it back! Not worth $3 plus the $3 shipping!!! Ridiculous &amp; poor craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> 5 stars all the way love it</li>
    <li> It is as cute as your reflection! Originally purchased as an accessory for my grand daughter&#x27;s 18-inch doll, I cannot let go of it! I show it to everyone and proudly announce that &amp;#34;I bought it on Amazon.com!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these for my Granddaughter for her AG Dolls.  I was skeptical ordering from China but they arrived early and they are so cute. She is going to love them.</li>
