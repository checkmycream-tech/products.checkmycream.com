<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> too small for anyone but a child and it took forever to get here</li>
    <li> It itches my daughters head. Waist of money.</li>
    <li> Pretty and cheep! Looks good in light hair. Great for costume or fancy hair occasions. I suspect hard ware would cause the stones to come off but I haven&#x27;t had that issue.</li>
    <li> I love this -- I wore it on my wedding day.  It&#x27;s very feminine and pretty.  It&#x27;s not made the best, however.  It withheld the day on my big day, but after getting tossed around in my jewelry drawer for a few months after my wedding, it eventually came apart on the bottom (the elastic detached from the netting).</li>
    <li> Headband was way too big to stay on my head and the netting it was attached to looked cheap. Wasn&#x27;t very expensive so you get what you pay for. Just don&#x27;t expect too much quality from this item.</li>
    <li> just like picture, clear and bright rhinestones</li>
    <li> item is cheap and tacky. nothing like described on the website.when I tried it on, the rubber band was so uncomfortable</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s beautiful , but it&#x27;s too tight for me, and the rhinestone wind my hair sometimes....but it&#x27;s beautiful....really beautiful, worth to buy it</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have also stated- this is not as pictured upon arrival. Very cheaply made and the crystals do not fully cover the mesh band. They are in oval shaped clumps that allow too much of the mesh band to show and makes it look very cheap- which it is! The crystals do not extend over the edge as shown which would give a soft random look. Waste of money !</li>
    <li> Super cute. Fits well.</li>
    <li> I SAW SOME THING SIMALLAR AT A DIFFRENT WED SITE AND IT WAS 79 DOLLARS SO WHEN I SAW THIS ONE I SAID LET ME TRY ITAND SEE AND WHEN I GOT IT I WAS SO HAPPY IT WAS SO NICE</li>
    <li> I ordered this headband for some family photos next month. I ordered the one with the white ribbon. The headband is a white mesh type that stretches over your head. The rhinestones seem to be secure on it, and look really sparkly in the light! I&#x27;m super happy with the price as other places would charge you way more for something like this. The only problem I have so far is that the headband is pretty tight. It&#x27;s not too bad, better to be tight than loose and moving all around your head!</li>
    <li> cute, unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t use it for my party because it took over a month to get to me, but maybe for next time.</li>
    <li> very beautiful, used for my wedding. if you&#x27;ve looked at bridal sites, they charge $200 for similar headbands. it is not cheapy looking at all in person, very beautiful vintage appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do NOT order if non-prime -- if it comes from china, you will not get it inside of 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend cutting back the mesh for a clean look.</li>
    <li> I was not happy when I saw the headpiece.  The rhinestones were loose in the bag and the white tulle was very dirty.  Whomever made the piece did not wash their hands.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the look of having the mesh be seen as I have dark hair. I think if it look like the picture it would have been a better fit</li>
    <li> It looks a little cheaper in person than I would like. It had one missing stone when I got it, but it&#x27;s not that noticable. I like how it feels and it stays put pretty well.</li>
    <li> I thought this would look beautiful for my sisters wedding, but after waiting 3.5 weeks to get it, it was a disappointed to open it and find the mesh falling apart, the \\&quot;flowers\\&quot; were actually only big blob circles, and you can see way more mesh then the picture indicates. Do not buy! It comes from Beijing China, return is not possible!</li>
    <li> This headband was fantastic looking. I had a tiara/headband picked out for my wedding and then I saw this a few weeks before I got married. I ordered and it was exactly as described. I cut it and attached my own tulle to the ends and tied it in the back so that I could get it incorporated into my hairstyle and then had the extra tulle hang down in the back instead of having a veil. I got so many compliments on it -- I think it was a bigger hit than the dress &#x3D;) Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Beautiful for the price, two gems were missing but I&#x27;m sure they could be replaced with gems from a craft store and nobody would notice from a distance.</li>
    <li> Cute looks like it appears. The delivery is slow but it is good product to own. Goes well with my wedding dress.</li>
    <li> looks unfinshed and cheap looking</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to look less &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34;  Its just plastic stones on a plastic sheet. Was hoping for maybe at least fabric.</li>
    <li> This looks really nice and well made!</li>
    <li> My 19 yr old granddaughter loves wearing this. It is beautiful and well made. I see her with it on often.</li>
    <li> Took a lot longer to receive then expected. The head was creased in three different places and the netting the jewels are sewed into were fraying ... Not super impressed... Cute from far away tho ;)</li>
    <li> Not what I ordered at all. Very disappointed was supposed to be for prom. End up in trash sadly enough</li>
    <li> Not the best quality but perfect for the price plus it looks really nice ! Planning to wear for my wed ! Thank u</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for this, almost 2 months.... So disappointed!!!! I was really excited, but know I&#x27;m sad!!!! :-( :-(</li>
    <li> The picture is not correct, it looks even very ugly! I do not recommend it at all! I would return it, but it would cost me more than its price, it is not even worth it!</li>
    <li> Not like the picture at all. my daughter could have made what I got in the mail with her eyes closed! Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> This is extremely cheap and came missing several gems. The netting it is made of is not very sturdy and it is badly cut and frays really easily. I will never order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I got so many complements , it is really pretty in person . But the only thing is , is that it broke while trying to put it on ! But thank goodness I had a safety pin on me to fix the problem. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> This headband is uncomfortable for a grown woman&#x27;s head. It is very tight. It looks similar to the picture but that&#x27;s it, just similar. It doesn&#x27;t stay in place and one of the rhinestones fell out within an hour of me wearing it.</li>
    <li> The rhinestones are just 4 oval layouts next to each other. NOT at all like the one pictured. This is something you can make yourself with prefabricated pieces.</li>
    <li> Looks nothing like it does in picture, and when I took it out of package about 10 stones fell off immediately.</li>
    <li> Cheap product. It came folded up in a small envelope.  When I opened it the sewing was coming apart.  Not happy with the product got something else from a different company</li>
    <li> The jewels on the headband is not what is in the picture. But the headband is still beautiful. Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Wore for my wedding day in HI...very classy</li>
    <li> Stones fell out as soon as I opened the package~~ its pretty but poorly made</li>
    <li> It took forever to arrive and, when it finally did, I couldn&#x27;t even use it. So snug! Putting it on was like a tiny vice on my cranium. It tangled in my naturally curly hair immediately and was difficult to extract.  It wasn&#x27;t quite as pretty as I had hoped, either and looked cheaply made. Regretful</li>
    <li> I give this a 4/5 stars just based on realistic expectations.  For 4 dollars and some change this is a beautiful delicate sweet headband that can cute you up with a messy braid or bun.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for kids it won&#x27;t last, but it you are very careful and aren&#x27;t messing with it constantly I think It was worth the 5 dollars!</li>
    <li> The mesh the rhinestones are attached to is just ok, and the rhinestones seem to be firmly attached. I plan to wear this to a bridal shower and it sparkles nicely.</li>
    <li> Not a pretty as I thought it would be but ok</li>
    <li> This feel apart the very 1st time I tried to wear it.</li>
    <li> Its really strecthed out but pretty.</li>
    <li> Got this super fast and it&#x27;s a lot nicer than I expected. A bit Different from the pic, but really nice for the price.</li>
    <li> This is junk.... frayed all over and rhinestones are barely sewn on.</li>
    <li> Very nice headband. Bought for my wedding and really liked it. Really delicate piece, if not used with precaution it will tear.</li>
    <li> It does look somewhat like the picture-but its really cheap looking if looked at up close. Its on like a fishy-net looking mesh-but its really not put together well. It is sewn on for the jewels-but they are not as nice looking as the picture. If your taking pictures from far away-its worth the 8 bucks, but if not too cheap looking for it to be worth the money.</li>
    <li> If I could give this zero stars I would. It arrived late, the mesh is completel frayed and falling apart and it is missing a rhinestone. I bought it for my wedding but will not be using it. If it didnt cost so much to ship it back I would. It&#x27;s cheaper to throw it away.</li>
    <li> I really like the headband, but I was disappointed that it kind of started to fall apart when I first tried it on. It was made with cheap material, I dont think it was worth $5.</li>
    <li> I was so exited to have it but has a lose stone just a samall one other then that it looks gorgeous</li>
    <li> I wore this on my wedding and I loved it. I did cut the back and add ribbon because my head never fits well into headbands and it always slides off but it was beautiful and just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Beautiful!!! Using it for my wedding headpiece!</li>
    <li> very poorly made and a waste of my money, glad I didn&#x27;t pay more than I did.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely a pretty piece but the jewels were falling off the second I unwrapped it. Luckily i have tools to put them back on and I used it for a Halloween costume so I didn&#x27;t care that much but if you are buying it for everyday use I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
    <li> Horrible head band. I should have heeded the reviews but I didn&#x27;t and I&#x27;m stuck with two of them. The other reviews were spot on they do not look anything like the picture. The clunky &amp;#34;gems&amp;#34; are arranged in a leaf-like pattern. It isn&#x27;t at all elegant as pictured. As they say you get what you pay for. I haven&#x27;t even tried to wear them because the &amp;#34;gems&amp;#34; are so heavy I think they will probably tear the delicate mesh they are on.</li>
    <li> The rhinestones are placed on a hard white mesh, and although the rhinestones are pretty they are fake looking.  The big downside to this head band is the elastic portion cheapens the whole look b/c it shows on the side of your head unless you strategically cover it with your hair. (The elastic portion is white and about 2 inches thick like the kind you buy from the fabric store - you&#x27;ll notice they blur it in the picture)</li>
    <li> I ordered this headband for a bride. It wasn&#x27;t what she was looking for for the wedding but&lt;br /&gt; she loves it to wear all the time.  It is sparkly and lightweight perfect for a little added glamour.&lt;br /&gt;It came very quickly and even though she isn&#x27;t wearing for wedding we were pleased with it&lt;br /&gt;And would order from here again,  the only negative was there were a few strings&lt;br /&gt;Hanging out from where the beads are sewn in....easily snipped those off. Very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> Got here before date I&#x27;m in love it sparkles a lot :) in going to wear it for my wedding :)</li>
    <li> This headband is just gorgeous! It sparkles in every angle and it looks even better than the picture! I am giving it five stars despite one of the stones coming loose when I received it. The stone was very easy to reattach and I&#x27;ve had no other problems with it.</li>
    <li> Got for my wedding... Going to have to find a different head piece,this looks cheap and not great for half up/half down hair for weddings.. Might be ok on a normal day</li>
    <li> Love this and the price can&#x27;t beat it . I will add ribbon and use as a slash for my wedding attire.  My hunny likes it too.</li>
    <li> It is very pretty, took a little longer than expected to get here, but I received it, and it&#x27;s nice!!</li>
    <li> super nice wore it for my cousins wedding got many compliments</li>
    <li> Such beautiful headband! Very feminine and delicate with lots of bling! It dresses you up without making a big to do.</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;m changing my review. Yes it broke within the first hour but in all honesty the price is so low that I glued  it to a lace headband and it&#x27;s beautiful!  You can glue it to any headband. The quality of the rhinestones alone are worth the cost. I now have a beautiful headband that would have cost me 10x the cost.</li>
    <li> Got it in white. Very beautiful and looks expensive. Doesn&#x27;t hurt to wear it, which is usually my problem. Definitely a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Great for future Daughter-in-laws wedding</li>
    <li> I got so many compliments on this for my wedding. And it looks awesome in pictures. I originally bought it just to try and becasue the pruce was cheap so ifni didnt like it I wasnt out a lot. When I got it, It looked really cheasy and cheap with the plastic mesh around all the crystals. But it looks awesome on! No one would have guess how cheap this was, stayed in place very well when I have a hard time with other headbands. It looks amazing!</li>
    <li> Pretty but way too small</li>
    <li> Cheap and ugly. If it was in the store I would have never purchased it. It is the fabic that makes it look unappealing. The rhinestones are decent but not the fabric.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wedding and was nervous. But when it was arrived it was so sparkly and quality. It was stretchy so it didn&#x27;t squeeze my head. The rhinestones don&#x27;t look cheap at all. The quality really outdid the price.</li>
    <li> falls apart. you can see the glue and mesh when worn</li>
    <li> Very happy fast delivery  Thank you</li>
    <li> This is a very nice head band with lots of sparkles.  I am planning on wearing this for my wedding.</li>
    <li> I chose the five star rating because the shipping was super speedy, it came almost 15 days before the estimated delivery date. I also chose the high rating because the product is SO gorgeous. The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice. In real life, the headband is super sparkly and the stretch band, that holds the jewels on, is very good quality. Also, the seller made a Chinese good luck bracelet with Jade and added it to the package!!! Very sweet!! Great quality, fantastic seller!!! Love love LOVE my new headband!! I get compliments on it allll the time :)</li>
    <li> Its really pretty it looks just like in the pictures, Im glad i bought on line, the material is fine.</li>
    <li> My wife requested this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas, and absolutely loved it.  Yes, it&#x27;s bargain-priced, and its durability will likely show that over the long haul, but it&#x27;s very pretty, and the band part holds it together nicely.</li>
    <li> pulls hair but is a fun accessorie</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice headband to wear when dressing up. It&#x27;s very cute but I haven&#x27;t had the chance to wear it as of yet.</li>
    <li> Extremely too large for my head and the mesh portion gets stuck in your hair</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Goddaughter, but the band didn&#x27;t last. It broke almost instantly. It was very nice but I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> It looked better on line, but too small for a bride so we will give it to the flower girl who will feel like a princess.</li>
    <li> This was better than I expected and better than photo. The glistening stones look rich yet trendy.  I will wear to spruce up any outfit and extremely comfortable</li>
    <li> This is a cute item. However bettter for young kids as it fits very small. Rhinstones are cheaply made but cute.</li>
    <li> Many compliments, it looks great, especially for the price paid. ~(_8^(|) yup, that&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s homer. needed more words to complete. thanks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking it would look like the picture, but was very disappointed when it arrived.  It looks cheap, and the shapes of the beads and design does not actually match that shown in I picture.  Luckily it was a cheap price too, so I can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;m surprised.  It may be fun for dress-up, but I will definitely not be wearing it for my wedding.</li>
    <li> I adore this headband exactly like picture super sparkly . Favorite headband I ever owned so worth it! You won&#x27;t regret</li>
    <li> This headband is very cheaply constructed and does not look stylish at all.  I&#x27;m going to give it away to a little girl who would use it for &amp;#34;dress up&amp;#34; or doll play.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product two months ago and never got it. I contacted the seller three times and never got a response. I was going to wear this for my wedding which upsets me because I thought it&#x27;d be perfect. I honestly wouldn&#x27;t even give them 1 star</li>
    <li> The item that I received was not the same as the picture above and the quality was very very cheap.</li>
    <li> This picture isn&#x27;t accurate.  The mesh is much wider than shown in the picture and it does not look the way it does on the picture on dark hair.  I was expecting it to look transparent, but it is white.</li>
    <li> It is gorgeous.  Completed our wedding dress.  It is great alone or with the veil.  A good bargain for the money.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s very pretty and pretty good quality.</li>
    <li> This was really nothing more than a piece of cheap junk. It broke getting it out of the packaging.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the headband broke the first time I tried it on. Beading pattern is not uniform. This item is cheaply made.</li>
    <li> First, this product came from China, so be prepared to wait a while for it to show up. This headband looked really pretty in the picture, but when it came, the jewels looked really dull. It is okay for the price, but I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and snug.  Perfect for a touch of subtle 20s glam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gems will pop out with extended use, but it&#x27;s not a piece of fine jewelry, so it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, so cheap</li>
    <li> Great fit and it looks just like the picture! I would have worn it for my wedding if it came in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Express shipping as an option</li>
    <li> Pretty. It&#x27;s a bit less stones than what is pictured. The edges were frayed but I was able to fix it.</li>
    <li> Not that great diamonds fall off almost instantly and I they actually stay on the actual fabric they are on looks cheap. I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
    <li> these ringstones are on a tull band that is too thick. the tool is so obvious that minimizes the sequence of stones... Big no no.</li>
    <li> Great price. Shipped fast. So cute. Would definitely buy from seller again.</li>
