      <li>Great all natural soap for your every day!</li>

      <li>The texture is great too - not too soft, not too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Olive, coconut, shea butter and flaxseed are the main ingredients and to give it a wonderful scent it has a mixure of red thyme, lemongrass, peppermint, lavender, tea tree and coriander which give it an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t feminine</li>
      <li>First, the packaging of this soap is top notch!</li>
      <li>Upon usage, the smell is not so strong.</li>
      <li>Amazing first impression and</li>
      <li>However now, I find myself resetting into the present moment when I pick up this beautiful soap, sniffing the lavender and tapestry of aromatic oils.  </li>

      <li>I really enjoy using this soap in the shower.</li>

      <li>so my husband can enjoy using it also.</li>
      <li>This soap smells so good better than all my regular soaps.</li>
      <li>Very gentle on the skin, won&#x27;t dry you out, and has a very pleasant lemongrass and ginger scent.</li>
      <li>I received these and immediately fell in love with the simple yet chic packaging and the amazing SMELL.</li>
      <li>I love the witty puns!&lt;br /&gt;It arrives ready to gift, if you&#x27;re not selfish like me and want it all for you.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the box, and my boyfriend immediately came to investigate the smell.</li>
      <li>I was, to be honest, surprised at how well it lathered up!</li>
      <li>: I loved the packaging- the three bars come individually boxed</li>
      <li>Definitely going to buy more!</li>
      <li>bar says you can use it to clean your whole house, but who has time to clean?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll take their word for that, because this hand-crafted artisan soap is far too wonderful to waste on my kitchen counters.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received these and immediately fell in love with the simple yet chic packaging and the amazing SMELL. I am using one bar as an all-purpose soap in our kitchen. It&#x27;s done a great job tackling messy pans but also feels really soft and easy on the hands. Because the packaging is so cute, I will probably keep the second bar for myself and save the third to give as a little hostess gift this summer. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I really love this soap.  On top of it smelling great, the products are 100% organic and awesome for any type of cleaning!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to incorporate more all organic/natural products into my home and I definitely recommend these soaps for anyone looking to do the same! The highlights: I loved the packaging- the three bars come individually boxed and they are cute enough to be given as gift! The scent is very clean and fresh, and I also was surprised by how much the soaps lathered and how soft they make my hands feel. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with an all natural soap but was very happy with this purchase. I received great service from the seller and really appreciated my follow up email to ensure I was 100% satisfied with the soaps. I&#x27;m going to be keeping a bar of this soap by the kitchen sink!</li>
    <li> I want to make babies with this soap. That is how much I love it!&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are top of the line.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is off the hook with delight!&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is hilarious! I love the witty puns!&lt;br /&gt;It arrives ready to gift, if you&#x27;re not selfish like me and want it all for you.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the box, and my boyfriend immediately came to investigate the smell. He then took one of the 3 bars to put in his bathroom. He&#x27;s just a plain old gold Dial guy, and he thinks this soap is great!&lt;br /&gt;You would not believe how soft and sweet my hands feel after using this.&lt;br /&gt;The bar says you can use it to clean your whole house, but who has time to clean? I&#x27;m too busy asking strangers if they want to touch/smell my hands and hear about my new soap!!!</li>
    <li> I heard about this soap from a friend, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try……best decision of my life. My skin thanks me daily. I will continue to order this soap for the rest of my life! I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews but I had to for this soap.</li>
    <li> You feel so so FRESH. The coffee bean exfoliant was a delightful surprise and experience. A huge plus; boyfriend commenting on how great you smell when you step out of the shower, certainly made me pleased! The packaging is quite eye catching too. Great all natural soap for your every day!</li>
    <li> Amazing soap! Love how soft it makes my skin. Smells great and best of all - no animal testing!</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have used. It comes very well packaged and would be perfect as a gift, but I&#x27;m keeping my package. You get 3 beautifully crafted bars of soap. That have no chemical or foreign ingredients in it. Olive, coconut, shea butter and flaxseed are the main ingredients and to give it a wonderful scent it has a mixure of red thyme, lemongrass, peppermint, lavender, tea tree and coriander which give it an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t feminine so my husband can enjoy using it also. Lastly there is ground up coffee inside the soap I don&#x27;t notice a coffee smell which is a good thing since I&#x27;m not fond of coffee but I do notice it helps exfoliate my skin which leaves it softer. I do enjoy the amount of lather it produces and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or greasy I really am left with amazingly soft clean skin! I am completely satisfied with this soap and would recommend for others to try it. I purchased this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I was not paid or sponsored for my opinions all thoughts reflected in this review are my own.</li>
    <li> I received these and fell in love with the soap before I even open the box because of the smell. It&#x27;s AMAZING!!  I washed my hands right then and immediately felt the softness of my hands. I&#x27;m going to share one bare with a co-worker and keep the other two for my self! I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap. It feels very luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;Since I use it directly on my skin I like the way it gently scrubs it.</li>
    <li> This soap appeals to me, as a health minded person. I would rather have things that are simpler, especially skin care products. My wife tells me the descriptor word for me is &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t even know that people were called crunchy - it reminds me of Charlotte&#x27;s Web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - this soap is amazing! It&#x27;s only in the last few months that I really learned of soaps made from scratch. You can get soap that wasn&#x27;t made in a factory, soap with ingredients you can pronounce! I really enjoy using this soap in the shower. The fragrance is strong, but I&#x27;ve grown to love it. I think it&#x27;s the tea tree oil that gives it the scent punch - and also antibacterial and anti fungal properties. There are 3 bars in the package, and we&#x27;ve gone several weeks of showering on one bar. I like this soap. Try it, you might too!</li>
    <li> Gotta say, this soap is pretty legit. If you&#x27;re into all natural exfoliating action, look no further. I received the package and first impression was these guys take their soaps seriously. Three bars came nicely tucked in tissue paper made me feel like it was my birthday. I&#x27;ve used it for a few days now and it is awesome. Very gentle on the skin, won&#x27;t dry you out, and has a very pleasant lemongrass and ginger scent. The bar is hefty and really feels like it will last forever. A little bit goes a long way! And I know they&#x27;re just bar soaps, but I really appreciated the personal touch these guys added. I received a thank you email with my order and tracking information soon after I ordered. Just yesterday, after a day of use, they emailed me to check and see if I was satisfied. These guys have a strange obsession with soaps. Very strange. Whatever the case, I appreciate it. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about Bar Vivant&#x27;s All Natural Handmade Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These soaps are handmade using all natural organic vegan ingredients that include pure essential oils and organic botanicals, so I was thrilled when I was able to purchase this set at a promotional price for evaluation purposes. The natural aroma is a complex blend of the thyme, lemongrass, peppermint, lavender, tea tree, and coriander that struck me as being very pleasant without being at all overpowering.  It&#x27;s neither fruity, nor floral, and anyone could wash with this and feel clean without wondering if they smell like the opposite sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of three 4 oz. hand cut bars comes packaged in a box well suited for gift giving.  The soap isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;, but it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; either, so it won&#x27;t melt into a puddle of mush when used. The soap has little bits of coffee grounds in it, so it exfoliates as you wash. It quickly produces a great lather that cleans thoroughly and rinses away cleanly without leaving your skin feeling oily afterwards.  Rather than drying out the skin like regular store bought soaps usually do, this one left my skin feeling soothed, moisturized, and smelling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experimented with it and washed my face with it last night, then showered with it this morning and since it lathered so well I even washed my hair with it - and I never wash my hair with a bar of soap, BUT, I got to say, it amazed me. My hair felt clean, not at all oily and it&#x27;s bouncy and looks terrific after using this for shampoo. I look forward to showering with it from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients of this soap include red thyme, lemongrass, peppermint, lavender, tea tree, coriander, saponified organic olive, coconut, shea butters, flaxseed, proprietary blend of essential oils, and organic coffee grounds.  I like that Bar Vivant soap doesn&#x27;t contain any sulfates, artificial fragrances, or artificial preservatives, just healthy all natural organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer says this soap can be used for virtually anything you want to clean, your hands, as a body wash, to clean the kitchen cutting board, scrub countertops, and even as a toothpaste. I&#x27;ll take their word for that, because this hand-crafted artisan soap is far too wonderful to waste on my kitchen counters.

    <li> First, the packaging of this soap is top notch! Amazing first impression and it just keeps getting better! The soap smells awesome but not in a perfume-y way. It is all natural and you can totally tell by the scent, texture, and the cleaning power is top notch! These people really know what they are doing! So very impressed with this soap. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other soaps and doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy residue. If you are in search of a natural soap that works, you must try this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> My wife and I are loving this soap. We are not using it on the Kitchen but on the bathroom! Smells really good and we feel really refreshed after the showering with it. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I started using my soap as a body bar and it&#x27;s wonderful. My skin feels so soft and and smooth!</li>
    <li> Packaging: The item came VERY well packaged/insulated so that it wouldn&#x27;t break or melt of be altered from its original condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size: The soaps were ALOT bigger than I expected! I was thinking I would get these small puney bars but no, they were about the size of a standard bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: Yellow-esque with brown speckles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics/Branding/Design: I loved the simplistic yet elegant design of the soaps AND the packaging the soaps came in. Each soap came in its own yellow box. The company logo is very lovely and it gets the point across of whats in the box and its not too busy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Review: The soaps are of a very good quality. When you open the box, you get a first whif and its very strong. But it could be because they were just enclosed for travel purposes. Upon usage, the smell is not so strong. I used the soap to wash my hands in the bathroom. The soap leaves your hands feeling clean yet not to dry. The product is organic and contains tons of good ingredients and Im excited to try it out a few other ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small Print: I purchased this item at a discounted price and was asked to give my impartial view on the product. This review is 100% my own and the cost of the product does not reflect my review in any way. I wouldn&#x27;t give a good review if it wasn&#x27;t a good product!</li>
    <li> These organic handmade soaps are wonderful. They have some great natural ingredients in it like olive oil, flax seed and coconut oil. The packaging was adorable and secure the soaps nicely. The only reason I took one star off was because the lemongrass smell is a bit strong at times and I was little confused as to what I can use the soap on. I thought it was a body and face type soap. But the packaging is says ktichen use. I&#x27;ve been using at as a hand soap and I have been loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product at discounted price for testing purposes. My opinion is unbaised and 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap- the scent is good and earthy, a perfect kitchen or household cleaning natural smell.  (think lemon combined with rosemary)  This is not a scent I would want to use however for personal (body) cleaning, although this soap technically could be used as body soap.  In our house, I am using it to wash hands at the kitchen sink, and to make homemade laundry detergent.  (To make homemade detergent, you combine borax, washing soda, and soap flakes.  There are plenty of &amp;#34;exact&amp;#34; recipes on pinterest.)  This soap looks, smells, and preforms just like a bar of &amp;#34;kitchen soap&amp;#34; you would find at a local farmers market.  I am really impressed with the quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I was not compensated and the opinions are all my own.***</li>
    <li> Loved the soap!! the packaging was super cute and they smell amazing - I had them in my bathroom but you could smell them throughout the apartment!  Definitely going to buy more!</li>
    <li> I shower every day and normally relegate the actions to my unconscious throught while I dwell on some abstract work task I have to tackle that day.  However now, I find myself resetting into the present moment when I pick up this beautiful soap, sniffing the lavender and tapestry of aromatic oils.  My skin feels revitalized - maybe it&#x27;s the coffee grounds that are doing it?  I don&#x27;t know, but what I do know is that my whole family loves it and, as something we use every day, I don&#x27;t feel bad nurturning our skin &#x27;organ&#x27; with this kind of purity.</li>
    <li> This soap smells so good better than all my regular soaps. I&#x27;m so tired of using chemicals to clean my kitchen and bathroom. I love that this soap is all organic and made in the USA. It is handmade so you really know what you are getting. Natural organic handmade USA soap.  As soon as I got my mail I could smell the beautiful scent. I added one in my bathroom and one in my kitchen. I decided to share one with my mother because she really has sentive skin and all soaps dry her hands. This one leaves her skin soft and smooth.  I can use this soap for many things. It also lasts a long time. 3 bars is a great price and quality. Not just any soap. You are paying for the quality handmade great smelling soap. My kids love it to and I know that it will not hurt them and that they are washing their hands with organic natural soap with no toxins, no gmos and it is cruelty free. My oldest daughter loves using products that are cruelty free. I recommend your try this product.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest real opinion.</li>
    <li> If you want a non-chemical soap with all-natural, organic ingredients, then you should definitely try this soap. It smells amazing, and it lathers so well. I was, to be honest, surprised at how well it lathered up! It also leaves your skin feeling really moisturized, not dry. There is no film or residue left over at all. I keep a bar at the bathroom sink and the kitchen sink as well. It&#x27;s great for removing kitchen odors, like onions from your hands--while leaving them smelling fresh.  I really love this soap, and am so glad that I tried it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful for sensitive skin!! I&#x27;ve struggled to find a soap I can use daily without irritating my skin - and this did the trick. The texture is great too - not too soft, not too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also keep a bar at the kitchen sink, for washing hands and dishes. It smells so lovely and it definitely more durable than most mainstream soap options I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Big fan.</li>
