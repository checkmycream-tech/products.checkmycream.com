<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was not a fan. Tiny cleansing pads and stung like astringent/toner. I prefer the tea tree oil facial cleansing cloths from body shop!</li>
    <li> Aside from the smell, which I am not too fond of, this product works well for my skin.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Not sure this is the right facial cleaning pad for my skin but a good product.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  It contains a very strong scent so if you don&#x27;t like strong scents you won&#x27;t like this product.  It cleans my face really well though and my face feels nice and smooth after using this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using since I received it but not much improvement.  Product is very oily and highly fumed causing my husband to awaken</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Works well removing dirt from your face without burning and drying out your skin.  I even use this product on my daughters face which is suffering from acne and has sensitive skin, no problem.  I will definitely purchase this product again.  Trying to find out if the seller has this in a larger container.  I would recommend this facial pad to anyone look for a good facial cleanse.  Works for me and my child.</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered this product I was really grossed out by the smell but you can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality. You get used to the smell and I have recorded these.</li>
    <li> It seems to get the dirt off your face but really smelly&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend it to someone that needed a really clean face</li>
    <li> I had been searching for months for a product for my acne/rosacea. I&#x27;d spent hundreds of dollars on trying out new products. I tried this product...what did I have to loose except for a few bucks. It has totally cleared up my face! I have to admit..I mixed it with a little bit of water when I applied it to my face; I left it on for about a minute and washed it off. The burning, itching rashes have disappeared. The acne is also gone! My face is very smooth. I use this product twice a day and the results are almost immediate!</li>
    <li> These are great to remove any makeup that did not come off when you washed your face. Perfect!</li>
    <li> These have been great for my skin to reduce blemishes and remove makeup without drying out or irritating my skin.  Even my husband uses them when camping/at festivals with limited access to running water!  The box seems to keep them sufficiently moist, but I do notice a decrease in pad saturation over time.  I follow up with witch hazel and a light moisturizer. Overall, I highly recommend these as an alternative to the harsh chemicals found in other cleansing products.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s acne. It works great in clearing up her skin. I will buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t read the other reviews yet.  I use this every morning.  My skin is normal to dry and it can be sensitive.  I prefer to avoid soap on my face; it seems to dry.  This Desert Essence does the job of cleaning well and has never left my skin feeling dry.  Obviously I would not use it to remove make up.  I only use mascara and I wash that off with a wash cloth easily since I do not use waterproof mascara.  The Desert Essence smells very strong but I find it to be very gentle on my skin.  I usually cleanse my neck front and back and love that it seems to get deep into pores.  I usually steam my face with a hot towel before I use it as well.  Anyway, it works for me.  I imagine as tea tree oil is supposed to be a natural disinfectant that it kills any germs or bacteria as well.  Then I moisturize well.  No problems.  I also like it because it is economical.  Let&#x27;s face it the expensive cleansers only stay on a few seconds.  I&#x27;d rather spend on a good moisturizer.  Hope this is helpful to any one concerned.</li>
    <li> I like it but it might be too harsh for my skin as it burns a little I think it might be better suited for oily skin where I have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Also helps with rosacea...very effective.</li>
    <li> This is probably the 6th or 7th time I&#x27;ve bought these... LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> To early to tell if product works</li>
    <li> Good facial cleanser.  The only bad thing I can really say about these is that they do not smell the greatest, like my tea tree shampoo...  but other than that, they work really good!</li>
    <li> A slighter thicker pad would be better, and very strong smell, but has definately helped with with some breakout issues.</li>
    <li> I rarely get excited about a product,even if it has good reviews because half of the time the product sounds too good to be true.These are wondeful!&lt;br /&gt;Im a 30 years and I have had acne for more than half my life,the most recent months being more moderate-heavy.&lt;br /&gt;I have periodic break outs,with the worst being once a month.Lately these episodes have been explosive,with about 7-10 CYSTIC pimples going simultaneously.If you know cystic pimples,its the worst.They scar,they HURT REALLY BAD and they last forever.They are big angry red pimples.I have moderately oily skin,mostly in the t zone and on top of that,I wear foundation every day to cover the previous breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;In short,after opening my pimples Dr Oz style,I swabbed with 2-3 pads.Its been 2 days and my skin is baby soft and my skin is calming dramatically,really quickly.Ive used straight tea tree before but never got these type of results,so its definately this formula.The smell is milder tea tree and the pads have a good,rough texture-great for exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the pads are small so I need to use 2-3.They remove makeup extremely well and completely though.&lt;br /&gt;I follow these pads with my faithful aveeno cloth pads and am very,very happy with the results.As you can imagine,after years of acne,Ive used a million products.These are ranked right at the top.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I have pretty good skin, but I noticed I was starting to get clogged pores and blackheads across the bridge of my nose and on my chin. I&#x27;m spartan with my daily grooming routine, so I was looking for a facial cleanser that was low mess, low stress, and these pads definitely fit those criteria. Not only are they ridiculously easy to use and very time-efficient, they cleared up all those problems in fewer than three days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That efficiency does come at a cost though. Tea tree oil can really...open the sinuses, shall we say, and this hits so strong my eyes practically start watering, especially when I first open the container or use the pad on my cheeks. Good ventilation helps to ameliorate this problem, and I usually end up wandering from the bathroom to the hallway, where the airflow improves the overwhelming sensation the tea tree oil creates. If not washed off immediately, that sensation can translate to a tingling on the skin, which I didn&#x27;t find unpleasant but may affect people with more sensitive skin. If your skin is very picky about what you put on it, or you have any sort of chemical sensitivity, you may want to try another cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One further caution: some facial cleansers are gentle and mild enough to use as the only facial skin care. This product is not one of those cleansers. Tea tree oil can dry the skin, which is not only a little uncomfortable, but can set you up for more breakouts later on. People with normal or dry skin should use this in tandem with something that moisturizes a little bit. Adding a moisturizing component may seem to defeat my initial purpose of \\&quot;skin care regimen in under 30 sec,\\&quot; but I use it as an excuse to put on the moisturizing lotion with SPF that I should really be using anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product does exactly what I want it to and it works well for my skin type. It is definitely not all things to all people, but it&#x27;s great for someone who&#x27;s not very sensitive and wants something quick, easy, and effective.y, and effective.</li>
    <li> Currently I am 21 weeks pregnant and certain skin care products are off limits. Tree tea products are something my doctor told me is ok to use. I love these pads! They don&#x27;t dry out my skin and my acne has cleared significantly! I for sure recommend these cleansing pads.</li>
    <li> I have a horrible case of facial acne, which is one of the reasons why I bought this product. I have tried so many things that have failed product after product. However, I was pleasantly surprised from the results of these tea tree oil facial pads after using it the first day! It has a very strong smell, but it doesn&#x27;t stink. It tingles on my face and, everytime after I use it, my face feels squeaky clean; plus, you can see all of the dirt that comes off your face and right onto the pad! It hasn&#x27;t completely taken my acne away, which is something I believe will keep appearing for as long as I live. However, ever since I began using these pads (at least once a day) I have seen less acne on my face. It works great to clean off all the dirt and oil from your face, so it is definitely worth a try! Thank you Dessert Essence!</li>
    <li> I have mature skin, but occasionally I have a breakout and tea tree oil always clears it up within a few hours without drying out my skin. I also use tea tree oil for inflammation and scaling that I tend to have around the hairline during the winter. It&#x27;s easier to use this pad than essential oil from the bottle. Convenient, priced well, and effective.</li>
    <li> I use these pads as a nighttime facial cleanser. I sweep three pads over the entire surface of my face/neck. I have noticed that they help to keep my skin clean and clear without drying or harsh chemicals. I am a fan of tea tree oil&#x27;s natural astringent properties.</li>
    <li> I use the the liquid face wash made by the same people and I really like it. However, I think these pads are incredibly strong. If you&#x27;re prepared for very abrasive texture and overwhelming scent this is the cleansing pad for you. I don&#x27;t want to diminish the benefits of tea tree oil, I just think everyone has a different threshold for scent and feel. Whenever I opened the jar my eyes watered profusely. I gave them fair a try but I had to give these bad boys away.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with desert essence face wash and moisturizer. I do not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin. The texture of the pads isn&#x27;t the problem, it&#x27;s the smell. The smell is incredibly strong and can burn your eyes. BUT, it works pretty well. In the instructions, it says to rinse after using it. That was a bit hard to do because of the smell. I found myself rushing to rinse my face off. SO, i solved the problem by only cleansing small portions of my face at a time with the pad, then immediately rinsing it off with a wash cloth. This product takes a little getting used to, so i recommend getting the desert essence moisturizer(i rated it 5 stars) along with it. Actually, i recommend the desert essence thoroughly clean face wash as well (i rated it 5 stars)</li>
    <li> Desert Essence has always made great and dependable products, and these cleaning pads are no exception. They are wonderful and leave your face clean and very smooth. My face is so much softer and cleaner from when I first started using them 4 months ago December. I choose this brand because it is Crulity Free and I could not be more pleased with the results. OxKom is the company it was shipped from and it was shipped the day I bought it arrived within two days. I reordered it for myself, my aunt in Tampa, Florida, and my sister in Enterprise, Oregon and they are as pleased with the product and OxKom as I was.</li>
    <li> Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom and teenage daughter both use this natural product!</li>
    <li> When I clean my face, it stings on all the places i have pimples - i use this after i scrub my face. I love the feeling, it is very strong and use some moisturizer after. - but a great natural cleanser!</li>
    <li> been using this product for over 6 months now and I love it. My face feels and looks better. Rarely have acne. Its amazing how dirty a face can get in one day. I would recommend this product for anyone who likes to have a clean, sparkling face and if you have a acne problem, this will help</li>
    <li> For a few weeks I&#x27;ve been adding tea tree oil to my shampoo. It&#x27;s done great things for my scalp and hair so I decided to try it on my face with this product. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now and I have clearer skin, less reddness, and it feels softer. I&#x27;m a guy but I care about my skin (more guys should). This is a great product and I will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but the first 5-10 pads were basically dry pieces of cloth.</li>
    <li> I have never written any reviews in my entire life, this is the 1st time ever!!! i really wanna share this with all of you.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, i have lots of breakout all over my face. I have been trying lots of products which cost me more than $500, but none of them is works!! Because I have spent part of my saving on those useless yet expensive products, so i would like to give this \\&quot;low-price\\&quot; Cleansing pad a try... wow!! these pad work like magic!! after less than 1 month of use, my face is obviously clear... no more breakouts... trust me, give this a try n u will love it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how i use it: after cleaning my face with cleansing foam (other brand), i pat my face dry with tissue paper, then i clean my face again with 1 of this Desert Cleansing pad, let my face rest for about 10 sec, then apply toner (other brand)and desert essence moisturizer... that&#x27;s it... i&#x27;m so happy that i have found this product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this product is helping prevent more breakouts from occuring and keeping small pimples in check if caught early-on, but I don&#x27;t think it does anything to existing acne. It has a pretty strong smell, but that does go away once dry. There is a stinging sensation when used directly on acne flare-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend it, but only as a prevention product, to be used after cleansing. I would not expect it to cure acne.... at least it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I&#x27;m shocked by what this has done to my skin. I have been using this for about 2 months now and my skin has DRASTICALLY changed. I had really bad acne problems. I was breaking out for the past year and was on the verge of going to the dermatologist because I looked horrible. Even my friends were beginning to comment on my skin. Then, I went to TJ&#x27;s and bought these. Well, the smell almost knocked me over but I didn&#x27;t let it stop me. I would say it took about a month for my face to clear up. I still have acne scars (aargh!!) but I have ZERO pimples. I have been pimple-free for about a month and my skin is RADIANT! There are days when I see a pimple trying to form but this stuff makes it go away!! I&#x27;m telling you--this stuff rocks!</li>
    <li> I guess this is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be making much of a difference with my acne. I will probably not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Like a real cleanser it leaves my skin feeling clean. I have tried green tea and chamomile but prefer the smell of tea tree. I use a  moisturizer afterwards to prevent my skin from drying out.</li>
    <li> If you want clear skin... try this product! I use it everyday when I get home from work. Haven&#x27;t had a breakout in months!</li>
    <li> I also just bought this item at Trader Joe&#x27;s, and was looking around online to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a discontinued item because they are great!  I got them because we live in an area with VERY hard water, which dries my skin out.  I wanted to get something that would allow me to wash my face with no water.  I&#x27;ve used several of the mainstream brand facial towelettes and have never liked them.  This, however, from day 1 (yesterday) has left my skin feeling soft and moist even without moisturizer for the first time since we moved here.  And I know the benefits of tea tree oil--I have used it for years for many purposes.  A couple of drops in boiling water clear up a sinus headache for me, and a drop or two diluted with a splash of water on a cotton pad clears up my skin.</li>
    <li> These facial pads are very effective in cleaning the skin and prevent outbreaks without being harsh to the skin.</li>
    <li> Love these facial cleaning pad.. Soft on one side rough of the other .. Gets the job done with one pad.. Unless u have a lot of makeup on...</li>
    <li> This stuff stings my eyes and burns my skin. Not good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These are effective astringent cleansing pads - would purchase these again and recommend to friends, some folks might not appreciate the powerful smell, but I like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks like hades but it seems OK so far.</li>
    <li> Love these, bought them for my fiance to use after the gym - he has always had some acne issues and even used acutane when he was a teen. These have helped keep his face clear as can be. Also purchased the Thouroughly Clean Face Wash and love it so much. You can&#x27;t beat the quality and price point.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these cleansing pads.  I buy them at Trader Joe&#x27;s when I can, but online when I can&#x27;t get to a TJ.  The smell can be off-putting for some, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.  Go.  Wash the makeup off your face.  Now use one of these pads.  See?  You didn&#x27;t get all the make up off your face like you thought you did.  This helps my pores appear smaller and I had some weird whitehead things that I had talked to a derm dr. about removing, but after using this they didn&#x27;t quite completely disappear but they are well on the way.  They can be a bit drying but I tend to use them in my evening regime and if I put moisturizer on right away, it&#x27;s fine.  They aren&#x27;t for everybody but I would recommend you try them if you like using pads to remove make up and daily grime.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try these cleansing pads because I love tea tree oil-based products...but unfortunately, this is an alcohol-based product! The pad made my skin burn and my eyes sting, and to top it all off, it completely dried out my rather oily skin and made me break out. Avoid this product - it is no good!</li>
    <li> I am excited to say that this product actually works!  It&#x27;s hard to find products in COS with Tea Tree Oil and this one works great on my oily combination skin.</li>
    <li> I bought the facial cleansing pads to use as a quick way to wash the dirt, grime and sweat off my face when working in the garden.  They work fantastic.  The facial pads are very easy to use and leave my face feeling clean and fresh.  I really like how even though the pads are tea tree oil, my face does not feel greasy, which is great during the hot humid days of summer.  Great produce that I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25, but have suffered with acne problems since my teen years. It&#x27;s not severe, but my face is almost never completely clear. My skin is also very sensitive. I have to be very selective about what products I use; most conventional products sold in stores contain ingredients and chemicals that are much to harsh and my skin really suffers. Because of this, I&#x27;ve been trying to switch to natural products with much shorter ingredient lists. I&#x27;m also guilty of being lazy at times and like to keep products around that can help me quickly remove makeup, cleanse my face, and treat my acne at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I really like these cleansing pads. As a general rule, I try to avoid alcohol, but I&#x27;ve made an exception for this product. I feel like the rest of the ingredients help balance out the drying effect of the alcohol. My only complaint is that they are soooo strong that the smell can be overwhelming, and I have to keep my eyes closed while using them. Other than that, these pads are great on evenings that I&#x27;m much too tired to use an actual cleanser to remove my makeup. My face feels very clean after using them. When I get a large pimple under the skin, I like to take one of the pads and press it up against that area to help dry it up quicker than it normally would. This product has become one of my staples, and I really want to try some of Desert Essence&#x27;s other products.</li>
    <li> I also picked this up from Trader Joe&#x27;s after reading about tea tree oil in acne message boards.  The pads are a bit abrasive so I dab instead of dragging it across my face.  Unlike others, I enjoy the strong antiseptic scent.  It has helped the breakouts I get heal much faster.  In the past, my pimples took forever to heal but not anymore with this great product.  I am planning to buy the facial wash as well.</li>
    <li> 2 stars because it is natural and might be right for a different skin type- I have combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s interesting to note that the second ingredient in this product is alcohol. This is very apparent when you apply this product on the face. As soon as the pad got close to my face, I had difficulty breathing because of the strong alcohol AND tea tree scent. Not only that, but the fumes also irritated my eyes. I had to close my eyes to finish wiping my face with the cleansing pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your facial skin is one of the most sensitive areas on your body. Something this strong is not good for it. It left my skin parched. my t-zone more oily than before and my cheeks flaking.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months. It is a good natural alternative to all of those cleansing towelettes that are on the market. The ingredients are much better for your skin than the other cleansers out there. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my breakouts but these pads remove face makeup. The reason I only gave two stars is because of the problems that I have had with the company. I highly suggest that you buy these in a store versus buying them with [...]. I never received my order and sent many unanswered emails to ask what happened. After my fourth email within 2 months I finally received a reply saying they would look into the problem. It has been 2 weeks since that reply and I still have not heard back. If only this company had better customer service.</li>
    <li> I love these face pads! They are surprisingly gentle on my sensitive skin, despite the fact they smell like something you could take the grease stains out of parking lots with. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the occasional hormonal acne from time to time, and these face cleansing pads are *amazing* at clearing up pimples, even the nasty cystic types that are so hard to get rid of. These will also tighten your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I do need to mention, though, is that these pads are not intended for full face makeup removal. I use these either in the morning on my makeup-less face, or after I&#x27;ve washed the makeup off my face, I&#x27;ll use one on my face to cleanse away all the gunk that my other cleanser missed. But yeah, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d try scrubbing one of these babies into my eye to take off mascara. However, they work so well at dissolving dirt, oil, and evening out skintone, I cannot live without these now. If you&#x27;re looking for something to clean and freshen your face in a hurry, or if you&#x27;re looking for a great post-wash toner, I can&#x27;t recommend these enough!</li>
    <li> Love your product!!..I bought this product because I had an area that I kept getting ingrown hairs...I have been using it awhile now and no more ingrown hairs so far...also had a yeast infection between one of my toes, this cleared it right up...I have since ordered two more jars, but sorry to say it wasn&#x27;t thru Amazon, I found it cheaper thru another company.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! I have cronic hives and Rosaca.  This has cleared up my face tremendously!!!  I use them twice a day and they clean so much off your face you see it!!</li>
    <li> I am currently in pharmacy school, and I want to share a bit of information I learned recently. In my Self Care class, we went over OTC Acne products. Though benzoyl peroxide is considered the first line treatment for acne, randomized controlled trials comparing b.peroxide to tea tree oil (5%) revealed that the two are equally effective. The only differences: Tea tree oil has a SLOWER ONSET than benzoyl peroxide, but it is LESS IRRITATING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was glorious news to me, because I suffer from moderate acne, and I have yet to find an effective cleanser for my skin that does not cause horrible flaking/dryness/redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try tea tree oil face products to see if it works for me, but I just wanted to let people know that it may take longer to get the results you are looking for. Generally, you should see marked improvement after 6 weeks at the latest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps for anyone who is doing heavy research on what to buy for sensitive, acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my teenage son who has been on prescription acne medicine for three years now. Every since using these he no longer is on any of the medication he was taking to help with his acne. He only use&#x27;s these and has had better results with using these pad&#x27;s than he did using medication. They really help get rid of the oil and also help close up the size of the pore&#x27;s his acne is very mininmal. Honestly within 2 days of using these his face looks better than it ever did. He loves waking up in the morning without all the oil laying on his skin!&lt;br /&gt;So if you are suffering with acne and alot of oil on your face give these a try my sister who also was on medication in her 40&#x27;s now use&#x27;s these instead of medciation she also say they have changed the texture getting rid of the oil and overall apperance of her face, no more giant pores and red bulging bumps on her face. Really a amazing product!</li>
    <li> very good customer serviceand I am happy for this order. Will come back again once out of stock. And thanks for the warm contact by email.</li>
    <li> I tried these pads when I ran out of liquid facial cleansers and was intrigued that it was all natural. I read that tea tree oil is really good for the skin so I decided to try it. The odor is pretty strong and maybe unpleasant if you&#x27;re used to those fragrant pharmacy brands. It smells like dirt/root, mint, and ginger and is so strong that when I applied it to my cheeks, my eyes sort of stung so it&#x27;s best to close your eyes. After you rinse, the smell also sort of lingers for a few minutes but it feels very refreshing. It does have alcohol in it but it didn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards. Of course, you should always apply moisterizer afterwards anyway. Compared to the high price (double Amazon&#x27;s price) at Whole Foods, I highly recommend buying it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Refreshing and clean feeling! Low price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I read that the texture of the pads is abrasive so instead of smearing it on your face, blotting is more recommended. And I didn&#x27;t use it for acne nor do I have acne, so I cannot say if it is helpful. But through past experiences with skin care, I&#x27;m pretty sure if you add this tea tree oil into your skin care regimen and refrain from touching your face, it should help.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product cus of the reviews i seen online, must say this product has been good so far, I wash my face in the shower and use this after the face wash and it still removes a lot of dirt that my face cleaner was leaving behind even after i exfoliated .. So far so good  ! !</li>
    <li> These cleansing pads in combination with the Tea Tree Oil Face wash and the oil free moisturizer have been the only answer to my chronic acne. I&#x27;ve suffered from moderate to severe acne since I was a preteen and trust me I tried it all. From expensive harsh creams to antibiotics and washes, this line of products from Desert Essence has worked the best. My daily routine: I cleanse twice a day with the wash and apply the oil free tea tree oil moisturizer. Then I spot treat with Desert Essences tea tree oil spot treatment. In the middle of the day, I use one cleansing pad to absorb excess oil and remove all the impurities my face accumulated. I actually dont rinse it off as instructed, I find that my skin tolerates it pretty well. Once a week, I use apricot scrub followed by Lerosett clay masque to keep my complexion bright and remove deeper impurities. The results are nothing short of amazing!! I still get one or two pimples occasionally but nothing like the amount I used to get before. My old acne scars are almost faded and new pimples are gone within a day or so with no scar. If you&#x27;re suffering from moderate to sever acne please give this wonderful line a try. I also love how there are only natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals. My family and I are reducing our daily toxic load so to find a product line that not only works but contains nothing harmful is a win win. Desert Essence along with eating healthier and supplementing with vitamins has cured my acne for good. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years!  great for bee stings, bites or breakouts! .. easy to pack in a bag or store in a medicine cabinet!  This brand hasn&#x27;t failed me for years..  I make sure I never run out</li>
    <li> I am on my second container of these pads and I really like them. Even after I have washed my face, dirt and make-up often comes off on the pads, which tells me they work better than just washing my face. The tea tree oil smell sometimes burns my eyes, even though I don&#x27;t use them around my eyes. But I really like having a natural pad that deep cleans.</li>
    <li> Great cleansing pads and such a great price with this company. It makes your face feel so tingly and clean. All this line of products I have used; the tea tree oil ointment and chapstick are the best. They have a natural repellant for lice, mites,scabies etc.  We need this now that we are in the mountains and wild critters come to our door to be fed. This along with D-Earth powder and we are almost all set!</li>
    <li> This really works for people with sensitive skin like mine. It removes all dirt and oil from your faces. You&#x27;ll feel refresh after each use. I actually like the smell but its kinda strong. I will definitely buy this product again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Really happy with these pads. Use as a toner after cleanse. My face feels so clean and refreshed afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree scent not too heavy. Have only been using a couple of weeks, so far so good.</li>
    <li> These pads have saved my skin. I am prone to eczema and these skins are gentle and nourishing so that they calm my skin as they cleanse. They have never caused a breakout but have alleviated or prevented quite a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this company is part of the campaign for safe cosmetics. They have signed a pledge to use only natural pure ingredients. The pledge was organized by the environmental working group, and I only will use products that have signed.</li>
    <li> I went to Trader Joe&#x60;s and paid $3.99. Great price and quality! I used to use other brands pads that cost from $16 to $30. This stuff clears pores, and helps with blemishes, also gives a healthy glow. Smell doesn&#x60;t bother me (the other pads are also strong), I would call it a medical/herbal. If someone has combination or oily skin, and breakout from time to time or everyday those pads are very helpful. I use them after cleansing as a tonic. On the days when I feel dry or my face clears out then I don&#x27;t use them. The price is a killer. I would buy them online if I live in a states without TJ stores, even with shipping is worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over two weeks on a daily basis. I have yet to see any improvement in the severity of my acne. I will keep using until the product is gone. Hoping it&#x27;s a delayed action. I love that the ingredients are natural and then I read the main ingredient to be alcohol. Alcohol is very drying and acne doesn&#x27;t react well, from personal experience. Hopefully it works for others.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing way to cleanse your face after a work out or when it&#x27;s hot outside. I keep mine in the refrigerator.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well. I like a lot of products with tea tree oil and I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 8. If it&#x27;s too strong I would put a little virgin olive oil or water. I use to think I should never put any oil on my face because I have acne but, in my older years I&#x27;m finding out a lot of natural oils or healthy oils work good for moisture. Happy hunting!</li>
    <li> I love these pads, they leave my face feeling clean and yet not dry. I use two pads everyday and recommend them to all my friends!</li>
    <li> I love the desert essence tea tree cleansing pads! They are a bit rough and tough like other reviewers have said - but I like that about them. I use them every night to clean my face and never have acne issues. The roughness of the pads helps really scrub the dirt off and the alcohol helps fight acne. It can be drying but i&#x27;ve found if I use the pad THEN wash off any residue with water it stops the drying effect.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old asks me to get this monthly!&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> I love all the DESERT ESSENCE tea tree products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all about trying new products every time I finish a package, but these are my exception. I&#x27;ve been using these for about a year, and plan to use them for many more. Let&#x27;s just go over all the reasons these bad boys have a permanent position in my medicine cabinet/life: 1. I love the packaging--I travel a lot, and these don&#x27;t run the risk of drying out like the resealable plastic pouches do. 2. The combination of the texture and tea tree oil remove all of my makeup, have cleared up my skin a bit, and keep me mostly shine-free throughout the day. 3. My mom bought me a whole box for Christmas so I&#x27;m stocked for a while.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing the 5 star ratings and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a bit skeptical. But so far have been using this product for almost 2 months&lt;br /&gt;and its great. I don&#x27;t have severe acne but I do get flair ups once in a while&lt;br /&gt;and these pads really get the oil and dirt off of your face and so far my face looks smoother&lt;br /&gt;and my acne is less prominent and has improved. The only thing about this product is the strong alcohol smell,&lt;br /&gt;it makes my eyes tear up and I have to breath through my mouth. But other than that, I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I just received this product 3 days ago and already I notice a difference.I have had a few pimples that I have been trying to get rid of for over a week. I have been using the Proactive mask as a spot treatment (this is suppose to work \\&quot;Miracles\\&quot;) and I didn&#x27;t see a difference, maybe this is why I gave up on Proactiv. I use this product once in the morning and once at night and the pimples are gone. I have been waiting on this for years. As a teen my face was clear but once I started into my 20s I started to get acne. I have tried everything, I am so happy that I found these. I highly recommend to anyone who needs help with adult acne. They are a bit strong smelling but I am willing to deal with it to have a clear face.</li>
    <li> I love this product! i am very acne prone and am hesitant to try anything but I had no problems with this product. I leave it by my bed and it makes it for easy access and i never forget to wash my face at night.</li>
    <li> I bought this because Melaluca (formal name for Tea Tree) is an oil, so I assumed these would be a moisturizing cleansing cloth. Instead they are more like an astringent and work completely opposite of what I need. If you are oily, you will LOVE these!!! I&#x27;m sending them to my mom and will continue my search. Let me be clear to say this is no reflection on the seller, my assumption was my own!! Best of luck.</li>
    <li> Made me break or worse.  Even when only used once a day</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin that is also very sensitive. I&#x27;m oily in summer and normal/dry in winter. Using this product in conjunction with the Thoroughly Clean wash with tea tree and awapuhi has worked wonders for my skin. The pads help control oil and safely heal acne overnight. It does smell awful, but when it&#x27;s rinsed, there&#x27;s no residual smell. In the summer, when I&#x27;m really oily, I use the pads twice a day (morning and night) with each wash. In the winter, I have to reduce use to once at night. I&#x27;ve had the best results  using the two Desert Essences products to cleanse and moisturizing with Suki Moisture Serum with echinacea and chamomile.</li>
    <li> I am using these pads to clean my skin in areas where I am very prone to sweating.  The pads seem to clean very well and they do not cause my skin to burn.  My skin tingles a bit, similar to when you first put Noxema on perhaps?  The main drawback for me is the smell.  It has a very strong smell of alcohol which I presume is the witch hazel. Other than that I smell an earthy smell. Not a bad smell, just very strong.  I use the pads and shower shortly thereafter to eliminate the smell.</li>
    <li> Really good product. Works well, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Anything with Tea Tree oil is a great product for individuals with skin problems.</li>
    <li> Originally I was diagnosed with Rosacea and later with adult acne. After using many different prescription medication and seeing no real results, I began experimenting with OTC treatments. Again, nothing I used gave me any real improvement. I read a few articles about the benefits of tea tree oil for acne and thought I would give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised at the results. My face started to clear up after one use. It appears to help the pores tighten and close thereby healing the acne infection.&lt;br /&gt;However, I am of older age and my skin is fragile so I cannot use the product more than once a day. I also recommend using a creamy face wash or Dove soap to keep the skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of tea tree oil is unpleasant and strong but I would still highly recommend trying this product. I use it at night before bed and believe me you get used to the smell quickly when you see the results.</li>
    <li> Great cleansing pads.  Really removes all the leftover dirt after washing your face.</li>
    <li> These are very well made and useful facial pads. I used them to help remove makeup prior to washing my face and they did so rather well. I loved the way the Tea Tree Oil made my face feel and I particularly liked the fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;I think these pads would also do well in a facial cleanser emergency, perhaps when you did not have time to wash your face.</li>
    <li> Great facial cleanser for those like me who are always on the go&lt;br /&gt;Love this product</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t as wet as I thought they&#x27;d be. They work fairly well (I accidentally burned my skin with them though), my skin always feels clean afterwards. I use them on my facial hair where face wash doesn&#x27;t seem to dig deep enough. If you&#x27;re sensitive/dry, DO NOT USE EVERY DAY.</li>
    <li> I use this every day as a natural alternative to Oxy and have had a lot of success with it.  It works the same or better without all of the chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love these so much, I just bought more. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad considering it is tea tree oil, which is never really a &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; smell. The pads  take off makeup quickly and effectively. You can also use these on your forhead and around you nose when you have a cold and they will clear your sinuses!</li>
    <li> The product reeks of alcohol. The smell was unbearable. I don&#x27;t think I have a sensitive sense of smell but I unfortunately could only use this once. The alcohol itself is another negative, would not have purchased if I knew it contained alcohol.</li>
    <li> But I rather like the smell. Not your typical smell though. I like the strength of these pads. I&#x27;m oily skin and my husband has normal skin and works well for the both of us. It WILL clean your face if that&#x27;s what you are looking for. What I don&#x27;t like about the other pads is that I usually need to use 3-4 to get the dirt and oil off.</li>
    <li> Strong scent and strong formula, very heavy tea tree and alcohol scent. I (gently!) wipe once daily, let it sit for a moment and then rinse off and apply a moisturizing serum and have seen an improvement in breakouts and blackheads. The pad is too scratchy for my liking and would prefer an alcohol-free formula but otherwise liking it for my combination skin.</li>
    <li> HUGE help in reducing my breakouts from not showering right after my workouts. I left these in my car and would apply on my chest and back straight after sweating and I felt refreshed immediately. Highly recommend this product and company. Definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it had a great review in a magazine I often read.  I wasn&#x27;t too happy with them.  The smell is horrid.  Especially since you use this on your face.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  Thumbs down.</li>
    <li> I like these. I like the face wash better because it feels like a more thorough clean but these are good for when I&#x27;m really tired and have to just get to bed real quick. They&#x27;re real strong smelling, but the smell fades. I love desert essence products.</li>
    <li> Worked really well as a part of my acne regiment. The pads themselves are a bit rough/scratchy but I like the scrubbing quality.</li>
    <li> what else can I say..... not so bad but not good. They are small than I expected and very thin.</li>
    <li> It causes irritation to my skin. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> These facial pads are great for scrubbing off the day&#x27;s dirt and oil from your face and feeling nice and refreshed. The scent is a little overpowering (I usually have to breathe through my mouth) but it dissipates quickly, and the pads themselves can be a little rough but they are great for cleaning. I also use them on my neck and surrounding area. I do find that my face is a little dried out afterwards, but I just dab on a bit of moisturizer and things are good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these regularly for a couple years now and I have definitely noticed a decrease in acne and breakouts. I have always had a minor acne problem and had resigned myself to constantly having a couple pimples on my face for the rest of eternity but these cleansing pads have almost entirely stopped any breakouts!</li>
    <li> The smell is a little overpowering the first time you use it. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of tea tree oil, you will not like these. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, but even for me they are a little too much. But my face feels nice and soft afterwards.</li>
    <li> I just started using these pads to relieve the irritation from kinesio taping and bug bites. Tea tree oil seems to work wonders to soothe itching and irritation. The pads are a great way to apply and clean, but they are really flimsy and sometimes you pull 2 instead of 1. I&#x27;m going to try to make my own with cheap applicator pads and a bottle of tea tree oil. I haven&#x27;t tried this on my face yet, fearing it will give me acne, but I originally bought these to use as a late day easy face wash (I have really oily skin).</li>
    <li> I like this product works well and my skin looks great would tell others to use this prouct!</li>
    <li> Nice product for make-up removal. Easy on the skin. I used to use baby wipes, but like this much better.</li>
    <li> This cleansing pad makes my face feel so smooth</li>
    <li> Burns some, but I avoid having razor burn all day.</li>
    <li> This is probably a great product if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but it was very harsh on my skin and made it break out</li>
    <li> I use organic tea tree oil to treat my acne (1 drop of pure tea tree oil to 5 drops of water) and wanted a faster way to  apply tea tree oil. But these pads are way too rough,  both sides of the pads are textured and when I applied it my face, it basically just scratched it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use any strong acne treatment,  an automated cleansing push or peels/exfoliates, please stay away it is way to scratchy on skin.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about a year.  I like how it cleans my face and doesn&#x27;t leave it tight.</li>
    <li> I like everything about these. They scrub really well, it stings a bit (indication that it is in fact cleansing), and my skin feels smoother when I&#x27;m done. I just do a quick wipe down before bed every night and dab a bit of moisturizer or coconut oil on in the morning and I&#x27;m good to go. I also have been using them to scrub some raised scars and while I&#x27;m not entirely sure, I think it might be helping to ease the redness of the scars. I know for a fact that they do help with razor burn.</li>
    <li> I love these. I use them daily.They get all the dirt and oil off my face. I use them to keep my Rosacea under control.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for the tea tree oil , because I thought its easier and more convenient than mixing tea tree oil and lotion at home. But after reading the ingredients, one of the main ones is alcohol, and the bad drying type Denatured alcohol. I was surprised and very disappointed. This ingredient will cause dryness and irritation and make acne much worse. I will not be using these pads and I recommend you be careful before you do, especially if you have dry skin and fighting acne.</li>
    <li> These are by far my FAVORITE face product.  I only use Desert Essence face wash and these cleansing pads.  They smell pretty strong and sting a bit at first but that disappears very quickly.  They leave your face feeling so fresh and clean.  I have used many TV products, drug store products and other natural products to manage my breakouts/combo skin with no luck.  These clear up any breakouts fast for me &amp; they DO NOT dry my face out, actually my face feels so soft after I use these. The pads also feel a little textured which exfoliates a little.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so bad I could only use it one time, so I don&#x27;t know if it even works. Could not stand the smell.</li>
    <li> seems to be working well</li>
    <li> These have turned out to be really harsh for my oily/acneic skin. They burn, make my face itch and really red upon contact. I&#x27;ve had to put them under the fosset first before using to make it bearable. The smell is also very very strong.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product I use it at night to take of my makeup and it makes my face feel so clean.  Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> The company very graciously resolved the problem by sending me a replacement. AND it was very well packed and sealed to ensure no leaking. I am trying it now and feel pretty sure that it will work as intended. These ppl follow up on their customers. I love their products</li>
    <li> First product that actually kept my face blackhead free!!</li>
    <li> Maybe I just haven&#x27;t used tea tree oil before but I find it really hard to breathe after using these pads.  Stings and burns to breathe!</li>
    <li> As far as getting my face clean, it&#x27;s great. The pads scrub really well so it makes my face feel like it&#x27;s actually getting clean. Afterwards, my face feels really really smooth, and I love that. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the smell/sensation! It&#x27;s pretty bad! I&#x27;m familiar with tea tree oil, and know what it smells like, but this stuff is like tea tree oil on crack. It is VERY mentholated, and when cleaning my face, not only does my face burn but I have to keep my eyes closed or else the product stings my eyes. It does not last a long time, but it is still pretty bad. As far as change in skin goes, I use this every other day or so, so not too regularly, and I&#x27;ve only used about 10 pads. So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. But they do get my face clean. So I&#x27;m happy overall. I&#x27;m not too sure if I would buy these again though, simply because of its potency. Whew! Some may find the feeling refreshing, but not me.</li>
    <li> I love these pads! They leave my face feeling super clean!</li>
    <li> I tried the cleansing pads because I read about the benefits of Tea Tree Oil. These pads work great ! I also love the cleansing lotion . In fact I&#x27;ve ordered several other products from this company and have been completely satisfied with the results. The products do what they claim to do. Oh Yeah my face looks smoother and clearer and cleaner without over drying. Much better than those expensive high profile products you see on TV. Will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> A part of my daily routine, I love this product. Great on my skin type (combination skin), it cleans, soothes, and relaxes me after a day wearing makeup!</li>
    <li> My teens suffer from acne.  This works better cleaning out their pours than even the leading infomercial product!  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I was using this product along with Desert Essence Daily Essence Facial Moisturizer [...] and at first, I noticed that I felt a bit of a burn and discomfort from both products. I tried using the products separately as well as together, and thought that maybe it was normal. However, after a few days of using this product, I ended up getting a severe burn all over my face, and broke out into a very painful rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started out as just a prickly pink, then went itchy and red, and eventually broke out into a severe burn, and was extremely painful and peeled for several days. It took weeks for my skin to stop feeling sensitive and raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why my face reacted this way, but I&#x27;m really sad that it did, because I had been searching high and low for an all natural facial product, and all of my searching on Amazon pointed to this.</li>
    <li> Got for my girlfriend and she says she absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I liked them, but I could only use them as spot treatment for blemishes. It is strong and burns my sensitive skin if they use them all over. Great as natural acne medication</li>
    <li> This product is way to strong for my face.  I&#x27;ve only used a couple of pads because it burns and stings my face.  It might work for someone else but not me...</li>
    <li> Love these pads!  Some people have complained about the rough texture of the pads, but I find them to be especially great at scrubbing/exfoliating my face.  The scent isn&#x27;t too strong, and the pads are very effective at clearing up acne quickly.  Will buy these again!</li>
    <li> Really helped my face clear up, but I wish the pads were a little less &#x27;rough&#x27; feeling. I wish it was a little softer. Other than that I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Tried this on a whim as I usually use the Body Shop products, and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Product is as described.</li>
    <li> I love these. Even my husband uses them and he has sensitive skin. They get deep down dirt and oil. They smell is strong but pleasant. I have purchased several times and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> My 13-yo uses them for acne breakouts, but I like to use them a couple of times a week also to help clean my pores and reduce their size.  They do burn a little until your skin gets used to them.</li>
    <li> Very good product.. Used after cleaning after wearing like makeup like a refresher. The pad has a little scrub side excellent for light exfoliating. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Helps fight teenage acne. This product has a strong tea tree smell, but it is worth it. My 16 year old recommend I order these pads a second time. Great product, reasonably priced!Highly recommend</li>
    <li> The chemicals or oils in this stuff is strong!  when i inhaled i started choking.  That aside, I give it 5 stars for back and chest acne and only 2-3 stars for face acne because it&#x27;s sooo DRYING!  i don&#x27;t need to use this stuff often because it works on other areas great but i wanted it for my face and it&#x27;s too harsh for that.</li>
    <li> I like these. They def help get the dirt off your face. When I used these I make sure to but facial lotion on right after I rinse or my skin dries out. But I think it works well.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Strong smell but works great cleaning my face.</li>
    <li> I really like the solution in these pads; however, they feel scratchy on my face.  On my fingertips they don&#x27;t feel scratchy, just my face--I guess because the skin there is softer and more sensitive.  I would prefer a softer/smoother pad.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an all natural alternative to my Oxy routine. Paired with organic face scrub, I&#x27;d say this worked fairly. Does NOT help with acne though (I get a few pimples here and there, Oxy would clear them up, this doesnt).</li>
    <li> I really do recommend this product because it did wonders for me! I had fairly bad acne before I used this product but now my skin is super soft and smooth when i wake up after using this the night before. Not only that but the smell really is wakening though it&#x27;s something you get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do:&lt;br /&gt;In the morning I use a cleanser to open up my pores and then wash it off with warm water. I keep the warm water on my face as I use the pad so the pad isn&#x27;t as abrasive. I rinse it off (as directed) and tada, my skin is softer. Occasionally it dries my skin so I use green tea as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I heat water, put it in a cup, put a green tea bag and leave it for 3 minutes, take it out and rub the warm tea bag on my face.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night I do the same thing but I never use green tea. I just leave it alone even if it&#x27;s a bit dry and in the morning my skin is so silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t for everyone but as a 16 year old with bad acne, that&#x27;s a lot to say for such an inexpensive product such as this.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend notices the witch hazel smell for about 2 minutes after I use them, but I don&#x27;t care as this is the only thing to tame my adult acne.</li>
    <li> I kept breaking out! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. Try the cleansing pads from Say Yes To Tomatoes. They actually work!</li>
    <li> drying and smells terrible</li>
    <li> I ordered this product hoping it wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Wow!! Not only did it not irritate my skin it is the most refreshing facial product I have tried. I love the way it smells and how clean and soft my face feels after I use it. It is also working wonders for a stubborn blemish I have been trying to make disappear for a couple weeks now. I am back to order three more containers to share with family.</li>
    <li> You will not believe how much dirt &amp; oil are removed with one pad AFTER you&#x27;ve already washed your face. Good product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The tea tree oil leaves the skin feeling fresh and free of impurities.  The textured surface of the pad allows for the product to collect dirt and oil you wish your skin didn&#x27;t have.  The product has a faint scent that is, not surprisingly, like tea tree oil.  I find that I can make this product last longer by cutting the cleaning pads in half.  After washing my face thoroughly, I have found I really only need half of a cleansing pad to remove remaining dirt and oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One pitfall of this product has been that I have had my cleansing pads dry out when I&#x27;ve neared the bottom of a jar.  When this happens, I use a pure tee tree oil that is sold by Swanson Vitamins mixed with a bit of water to saturate the pads again.  Pure tea tree oil can sting badly so I have to dilute it with water.  You can also use olive oil.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other small downside is that while I find tea tree oil to be great at combating acne, it can be drying.  I already have dry skin so additional dryness is not something I want to invite.  I use [[ASIN:B000GZJITI California Baby Calendula Cream, 2 oz]] or [[ASIN:B0009ET5O4 Burt&#x27;s Bees Repair Serum, 1-Ounce Bottle]] to help with dry skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If out of stock online or if you just want to try one jar, Swanson Vitamins and iherb (you can use LEK375 for a discount there) both sell this product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the avid recyclers: This product is packaged in a plastics #5 container, which can be very difficult to recycle in most communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in the United States.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. The best facial cleaning pad around.  I had my children use them during the adolesence years to keep acne down and they work.</li>
    <li> These pads are a lifesaver. I have been looking for something like this. Gives me just the right clean without all the harmful chemicals. My face feels clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Excellent for stubborn acne for teenage boys and girl&#x27;s left behind makeup. Not what she left behind on the boy but on the girl after she washes her face. The scent is somewhat strong at first, tea tree, but then dissipates. After using these pads for a day or two, there was a dramatic clearing on acne especially around the irritated shaving area.&lt;br /&gt;Us girls used these pads as well after washing and exfoliating our faces. The pads removed a lot of excess makeup that was left behind.&lt;br /&gt;We noticed less oily skin and it was refreshing on hot days when we don&#x27;t wear makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this brand and particular Facial Pads. They definitely work and help clean and clear up young skin without harsh chemicals being used daily.</li>
    <li> The pads work, they absorb dirt off of my skin.  The thing is they SMELL so so bad lol but once you get past the smell it is great. It smells like dirt.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time use it! It too strong for me! I didn&#x27;t use so much! Because my skin doesn&#x27;t feel good with it! It is a good stuff, but not for me!</li>
    <li> These pads are excellent for cleaning face when you dont have the time to do a through cleaning. Gets the job done and the prof is in the pad after. Great price. Will buy again</li>
    <li> even though it said facial cleansing, it did nothing for my face :P but i give it four stars because it completely cleared all of my back acne! this stuff is wonderful im ordering again!</li>
    <li> Great product, great company. Not a bad price for 50 pads. This is amazing for blemishes and acne and will make your skin amazingly soft!</li>
    <li> This item works great but I did find them much cheaper on other sites would be my only complaint. other than that its great</li>
    <li> Oily skin has a product that takes clean face to a whole new level! Love this product! I have to buy often, though because I use it up so quickly! I love the way it makes my skin feel. I love that its convenient. It does smell like tea tree oil, which alot of people find offensive, but the scent isn&#x27;t as overwhelming as pure tea tree oil. Its a bit fresher. I love this product, though. I have oily skin and large pores and this product does well to make my skin feel nice after washing and to refine my pores!</li>
    <li> i love this stuff and i think that it does a great job of removing makeup/dirt/oil. the only thing i don&#x27;t like about it is that the smell is really strong.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face oil free and feeling totally clean! I wish you could order more at a time...50 goes fast.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this product. It smelled very strong like an astringent, so I was hoping that meant it would work...nope. I had no satisfying results. If anything, this made my skin worse. After cleansing my face with one of these pads, my skin would look and feel greasy instead of clean and refreshed. I will not be repurchasing this.</li>
    <li> I am 53, and have had very oily skin all of my life, but it has never been overly sensitive. When I saw alcohol in the ingredients, I wasn&#x27;t concerned, because for four decades I have been using products - from many brands - with alcohol as a main ingredient, and I&#x27;ve never experienced a problem. When I went to use it for the first time, I discovered the fumes from the alcohol were so overpowering I literally could not draw a breath, and when I did it was more of a gasp. I let the pad air out for about 30 seconds, wich helped some, and I was able to apply it to my skin. Afterwards, my skin didn&#x27;t feel cleansed, so much as stripped. I decided to give it a try anyway, since not much bothers my skin, but after a few days, my skin began to break out. I think the problem may be that the alcohol is grain alcohol, also known as moonshine, and it&#x27;s too harsh to use on skin. Maybe next time I&#x27;ll try something with witch hazel.</li>
    <li> nice and my face feels quite clean after...the smell is strong but i don&#x27;t mind. just wish the pads were biodegradable!</li>
    <li> this product is just too strong for my face… it stings.. it may be good for some, but not for me...</li>
    <li> Desert Essence make really great product! I have been using this for years.</li>
    <li> I use these pads at the end of the day to clean my face. I love the way that they make my face feel afterward, totally clean and refreshed. It softens my skin a lot and my acne is starting to clear up too. I love that it&#x27;s tea tree and not full of harsh chemicals. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with razor bumps when I shave, and tea tree oil is the only product I can find that clears them up for me.  While a bottle of tea tree oil is probably a better bargain, these pads are convenient and have enough oil in them to do my whole face/neck.</li>
    <li> Having suffered from hormonal adult acne for some time and feeling insecure, not confident, and unattractive, I have tried numerous products to help eliminate or even reduce the problem and frequency of outbreaks. I came across an article that stated that the majority of ALL acne comes from dying mites that live in your bed and sadly take up residence on your face. Further readings had suggested that Tea Tree Oil and Lavender kills this bacteria due to its anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-fungal properties. So, I purchased these pads for my face during the day. Almost instantly after using these pads, I could tell an immediate difference. I also purchased some Neutrogena Nightly Stress Control Acne pads but what I found was I would use the Neutrogena pads first, then use these pads, and because these pads are more coarse and fibrous, you could see all the oil dirt and debris that the OTHER pads left behind! I am thrilled with this product, have seen real, incredible results in a short amount of time, and they use a lot of natural ingredients, oils, and herbs. These pads are real nice and coarse, they act as a microdermabrasion without scratches and really cleans all the grit and grime from your face. In reality, no one can take a shower every time, multiple times during the day, when they feel oily and dirty, but using these at lunch and in the evening makes you feel clean and renewed. Perfect for oily skin types and acne ridden faces. I highly recommend this product and is the best I have ever used for acne treatments. The only down-side for me, personally, is I hate the smell of Tea Tree Oil, it is not a sweet feminine fragrance and I really do not want people to associate the scent with me because it is strong and earthy. But this is just a personal preference. In addition, I would consider this product uni-sex, almost favoring males however because of the earthy smell, but the results are so extreme, that this is something I can easily overcome and is wortha clean and clear complexion that bolsters my confidence and attractiveness!</li>
    <li> Love, love love these. The tea tree oil works wonders on blemishes but even when I&#x27;m not breaking out, I still use them because I love the clean way they make me feel. Ialso think they are great to use after a run if you dont have time to jump in the shower immediately.</li>
    <li> Not really what I hoped for, the texture on the pad is pretty rough against the skin, but I get the design, it probably grabs onto makeup and grime better that way. It&#x27;s also pretty strong smelling and the recommendation to rinse off your face with water afterwards, kind of defeats the purpose of a &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34; face cleansing process, I might as well just use the traditional soap and water then. I will keep the item since I&#x27;ve used several pads and it&#x27;s NOT terrible, but I would probably not reorder it.</li>
    <li> Item arrived timely and as described. Packaging as pictured. The pads themselves have a waffled impression for scrubbing texture and are thoroughly moistened from the ones on top to the ones on the bottom.There is a scent to them, the menthol-like tea tree scent. This product does contain alcohol so it has a slight alcohol-y smell as well- but it&#x27;s not terribly bothersome. And being sensitive to fragrance this product does not cause any headaches or other adverse reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product a couple weeks now and I have noticed overall improvement to my skins texture. Meaning, less little bumps (clogged pores) and I&#x27;ve noticed my pores shrinking a bit (around my nose where they can sometimes enlarge when oily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with the product and would generally recommend it to others- though I would not recommend it for those with sensitive skin because of the alcohol content.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a quality product.  Is just like a brand name acne pad except that the active ingredients are essential oils.</li>
    <li> these are the only cleaner/toner my daughter will use on her face- even through the teen years- they work great!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really help my acne</li>
    <li> Funny smell, I threw them away.</li>
    <li> Dessert Essence skin care is my absolute favorite.  Will not use anything else on my face.  Helps with my oily skin.</li>
    <li> Clean scent, lightly exfoliating, very kind to even the delicate regions of my combination skin.</li>
    <li> Love these pads, makes your face feel like very cleansed.</li>
    <li> I bought these pads because I wanted something to clean my face at night before I went to bed, but I wanted it to be easy to do.  Also, I sometimes break out if I do not get enough sun or go to the tanning beds, so I was hopeful the green tea would help.  Since I&#x27;ve been using these, I have noticed that my skin is clearer, the skin tone is evening out, and also, when I use them, there is a STRONG scent, however, my face truly feels like it is breathing after I use them.  My skin is much cleaner now, and I can definitely tell a difference.  I&#x27;ve already ordered 3 more of them so I know I will not run out soon.  I use these in the evening.  My regimine is:  use the pad, wipe off with a cold washcloth, and then put on a night cream.  In the mornings, I use the green tea facial cleanser and then the green tea facial toner by The Body Shop followed by the mattifying green tea moisturizer by Body Shop as well.  It&#x27;s really controlling the oil and dirt, and my face is not shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a low-maintenance type of girl or guy and want to have cleaner skin without doing all sorts of things, I highly recommend these.  And, hey, the price is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had problems with acne, but I do have combination skin.  I use a tea tree oil pad every night before I go to bed, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out &amp; leaves it extremely clean- and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old container had a flat bottom, the new container has a rounded bottom causing the pads to dry out before you can use them all (at least before I can use them all).  Bring back the old packaging and I&#x27;d happily give 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging aside, I still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Strong scent but these are awesome cleansing pads. They remove dirt and oil that my cleanser misses. Doesn&#x27;t burn or dry out my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> really effective for me.  I&#x27;ve battled acne for a long while as an adult and this has made a huge difference...amazing.</li>
    <li> Use this stuff after shaving to heal small unnoticeable cuts, it definitely feels like its burning at first but it soothes shortly after. It does have a vinegary smell as well so if you can&#x27;t stand the strong smell then don&#x27;t buy. My skin looks so much clearer and smoother after two weeks. Tea Tree is expensive I&#x27;ve found out.</li>
    <li> as a person with very sensitive skin, i found that these cleansing pads worked wonders for me. in conjunction with omega-3 suppliments (flax seed oil) i found that my skin cleared up before i was even halfway done with the pads! i use it once a day before bed. generally my skin breaks out from most other face wipes, but these left my face feeling fresh every time i used them.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy pleasant transaction! Highly Recommend!! Great value for the money! Tea tree oil is an awesome ingredient and has so many benefits!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it has tea tree oil in it. I applied it on my face since i have blemishes. And since i have back pain, it&#x27;s hard to was my face. I bought this, thinking, all i&#x27;ll have to do is wipe my face (sitting down).But oh my goodness! The smell is so strong! I couldn&#x27;t even open my eyes (Of course, i didn&#x27;t apply it on my eyes!!!). I just threw the whole thing out! All i have to say is buyers, beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I started breaking out before I would workout and realized that it was because of my makeup. I needed a quick fix that would remove it, so I started using this before my workouts and it greatly reduced my acne. The smell is a bit intense but the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It does wonders for my skin!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used one or two of these so far, but they seem to work pretty well.  They don&#x27;t have the astringent smell associated with many cleansing pads and leave my face feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> These wipes are great! You can see all the grime they pull out. The only problem is... they stink. Like, really, really stink. It reminds me of an ammonia scent, but since they&#x27;re cleansing and organic, I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> None of the leading brand name face pads have anything on these tea tree oil pads. These things are STRONG and they leave no weird residue. In fairness, I do have to mention that the smell may take a little getting used to (my wife still doesn&#x27;t like it). The smell may linger for about ten minutes. I, however, feel that is a small price to pay for the best-cleaning face pads I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this originally because of my acne. I heard tea tree oil is very good for it so I didn&#x27;t want pure tea tree oil so I got this. It feels interesting and the tea tree oil sorta smells but other than that it&#x27;s been helping me out a little more. So I like it. :)</li>
    <li> Perfect for my (aging) female skin, as well as for my 12-year-old son&#x27;s changing complexion.  They travel well and work wonders.</li>
    <li> Most amazing stuff! Cannot live a day without it!</li>
    <li> I thought this product was amazing! It really helped with keeping my skin clean and free of breakouts! The smell is a little strong, but of course it is, its tea tree oil. I usually only put it on after I was my face in the morning and my skin feels clean for hours. Overall, it&#x27;s amazing and I order some every two months! It become a skin treatment I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses these and really likes them. Dries up any blemish and makes them go away faster. Have purchased repeatedly.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Prevents pimples and exfoliates blackheads. I cannot say enough about this product and it&#x27;s extremely affordable! Texture of my skin has completely changed! LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I use these for everything from cleaning off my face to wiping up under &amp;#34;the girls&amp;#34; when I need to freshen up, to cleaning my pug&#x27;s wrinkly folds on her face.</li>
    <li> I now wash my face then use these pads on my face and neck. I am really amazed at how much dirt they get up after I have already washed. They get rid of oils and don&#x27;t leave skin too dry as long as I splash with water immediately afterwards. I also have been having fewer break outs.</li>
    <li> I have used the tea tree oil cleansing pads and fell in love! My skin was never as clear as it was while using this amazing product! When it came time to reorder, I ordered 2 knowing that I would definitely use them all up.  The problem is, when the product arrived, it was in a new package.  This jar was white whereas my old trusted product came in a brown jar with brown lid and green label.  I figured that it must be the same product only in a different packaging.....WRONG!!!!!!!! The pads were dried out, the smell was different, and there was no tingle on my face telling me it was working.  I compared the ingredients from the old packaging, and found slight variations but the end product is completely different in my opinion.  I need to find the old product again in the old packaging.  I will be contacting the seller.</li>
    <li> I really like these. They smell good and they clean my face well. I wash my makeup off and then use one of these and I&#x27;m amazed how much makeup was still on my face. There are a lot of negative comments about how scratchy these pads are. They ARE scratchy but I like it. They aren&#x27;t any more scratchy then using clearasil or noxema face cleansing pads. I will reorder these when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Priced right; shipped quickly; and packaged well.  Highly recommend product and seller.</li>
    <li> I have been using bare minerals for a long time.  It seemed to stop being effective, my skin felt dry and I had break out spots.  This product absolutely helped clear up my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to know how I didn&#x27;t hear about Desert Essence until now. All of the products I&#x27;ve used from them have worked wonders for me. I design, sew, and wear costumes along with lots of makeup. For those of you with skin like mine, you probably cringe at the thought of wearing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Before I started using their products, I was embarrassed of my oily skin and how foundation seemed to drip off of my face after an hour or two after application. My huge pores sucked some of it up, and my goodness it wasn&#x27;t pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many facial cleansers, masks, ect. Nothing worked as well as these guys. These facial pads are great for a quick clean if you don&#x27;t have time to properly wash your face, and if you work outside and sweat, then this product is definitely a must.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with these cleansing pads.  They clean without drying my skin, unlike others that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love natural over chemical and I have long known the benefits of tea tree oil, so this is an excellent buy for any one of any age!!!</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying 100% tea tree oil but this has other essential oils in it. It hasn&#x27;t really done much for my acne.</li>
    <li> Great Cleaning Pads!  Just know that they are a little strong, but they lift the dirt for sure.  The smell is not pleasant but if you can get past that it works well.</li>
    <li> I have been using Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil Facial Wash for awhile now so when I came across these cleansing pads I figure I&#x27;d try em out. Shipping was quick and I like how compact the container is and looking forward to using these pads</li>
    <li> I should have read the description more closely. . . this is definitely NOT a replacement for makeup wipes that can be used on your whole face.  I don&#x27;t think I have sensitive skin (at least, I&#x27;ve never thought that before), but this definitely burns the more delicate areas of my face.  Good for removing oil, but not something I want to use regularly.</li>
    <li> I think it works wonders.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think it had alcohol in it but it does. :(  Nonetheless a little gentler than other similar products.</li>
    <li> Although I have read up on tea tree oil and it is very good for your skin, a lot less harsh than using alcohol to clean your face!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my boyfriend for acne on his cheeks. He has been using these with the Biore wipes and his acne is clearing right up. He said they do not dry out his face, but they sting a little bit at first. They do have an earthy scent due to the tea tree oil, but if you can get past that they are great!</li>
    <li> My teen daughter loves the way it makes her skin feel and I love it that it doesn&#x27;t have loads of synthetic chemicals.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Love the exfoliating scrub pads, the smell is something you have to adjust to, but other than that, works great on acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Works great and great for acne breakouts</li>
    <li> I love this product and you shipped it to me promptly as well.  Thanks for sending out my Desert Essence face product!</li>
    <li> Good product. I use it for cleaning my face as well as deodorant since I have extremely sensitive armpits. Docked off a star because my order got delayed for some strange reason and came a week later than it had originally guaranteed.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product. It does remove dirt from your face but over time, it became harsh on my skin,it BURNS a great deal so I don&#x27;t use it too often, The BURNING may be a combination of The Neutrogena Blackhead Scrub I use. Maybe using both products is a bit much. It does have a STRONG ODOR.</li>
    <li> I was lured in by the low price.  I admit it!  But pads are rough and they dried out pretty quickly.  I had to toss 75% of the jar.  I would recommend finding another brand.</li>
    <li> I love tea tree oil so I love this. I like that it can exfoliate dead/peeling skin off too.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I use it in the evening after cleansing as a clarifier. After using it for over a month, my skin is smoother with less breakouts. Occasionally I get redness after using it, but it is gone by the next day, and my skin is clearer. I use it only in the evening as twice a day would be too hard on my skin, but once a day is the ticket!</li>
    <li> Love the product will purchase again</li>
    <li> I was not aware that the product contained alcohol. The smell is very strong. This product really dried out my skin and made my skin peel. I am not please with this product at all and will not be purchasing again. I was told that I could add more green tea if I chose to, but I preferred not to. The product should be able to preform the task its suppose to without add ins.</li>
    <li> I use these a couple times a day and they are great! I have sensitive skin too. The only downside is that my significant other doesn&#x27;t like the scent eight after, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and it fades in a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Came within a week. I live in PA. For a brand I haven&#x27;t heard off not bad. Leaves my face, completely clean and soft. Strong smell but worth it. Very nice will be ordering more.</li>
