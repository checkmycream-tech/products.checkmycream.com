      <li>Quick application and very good coverage</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>Absolutely the BEST mascara ever!</li>
      <li>I have tried bargain brands (Maybelline Great Lash) but never get the same flawless results.</li>
      <li>Really the best!!</li>
      <li>I apply mascara every day, and wash it off at night with warm water and Dove body soap.  </li>
      <li>It was worth every penny!!!</li>
      <li>Great definition and lengthening of lashes in just two quick coats.</li>
      <li>I have been using Dior Diorshow Iconic Mascara Noir for several years and have always been very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t even closely resemble my favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best, and I&#x27;ve tried many different brands-</li>
      <li>I LOVE this mascara.</li>
      <li>Iconic does it what it promises</li>
      <li>I have been using CD Iconic Mascara for years</li>
      <li>I love that.</li>
      <li>And my favorite, I dont have sensitivity to the ingredients.</li>
      <li>(Not so, the iconic curling mascara for some reason.)</li>
      <li>but none can top this.</li>
      <li>You can buy much better mascara for way cheaper.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Putting it in the best light possible, it gives a much more natural-looking lash.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product, and I feel that the main difference between Iconic and the original is the wand.</li>
      <li>Very good！&lt;br /&gt;A good Mascara</li>
      <li>I never wore mascara, except on special occasions, now i wear it every day!</li>
      <li>It is also easy to take off with makeup remover - easier than Dior Show in my experience.</li>
      <li>I liked the color and consistency of this mascara, but didn&#x27;t notice it to be any better than those I could buy much cheaper in a drugstore.</li>
      <li>which is a HUGE plus for me-</li>
      <li>If I want something like that I&#x27;d go out and buy a cheap mascara at the drugstore.  </li>
      <li>if I&#x27;m in a rush, I can skip curling my eyelashes first since this mascara does a pretty good job all by itself.  </li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the original DiorShow mascara, and I love trying new things, so I gave the DiorShow Iconic Mascara Noir a try.  </li>
      <li>Never clumps and gives your lashes a clean coating.  </li>
      <li>brush is thick with a lot of bristles which does a great job of catching your lashes.  </li>
      <li>When I try separating them using a clean mascara brush (a trick I learned from a makeup artist), it flakes off</li>
      <li>Also, the regular Iconic used to put a really nice curl in my lashes.  </li>
      <li>Despite long staying power easy to remove with good quality remover.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>Does NOT flake, smear or or even run too much if you happen to cry :-)</li>
      <li>The reason that I haven&#x27;t given it the full five stars, however, is because of the fact that it dries really quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also better than Dior&#x27;s other mascaras, which are thicker and have spindly brushes, as opposed to a nice full one.</li>
      <li>I was using Dior Show for a while, and even wrote a review about it, but after trying Iconic, I think I like Iconic a little better.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>I gotta give this product credit, though, because after several coats it looks pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It is nicer than a drugstore mascara, and worth the price.</li>
      <li>Worth the money</li>
      <li>This mascara is well worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I have to put on several coats before I can tell that I&#x27;m even wearing anything.  </li>
      <li>I typically purchase the dior show mascara and wondered if the iconic would be better than the show.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Dior mascara and used DiorShow for a long time.</li>
      <li>Iconic has a smaller, more pliable plastic brush, whereas the original Diorshow has a giant wand with lots of large bristles.    </li>
      <li>I really liked the classic Diorshow mascara, as it lengthened my pathetically short eyelashes and gave them volume as well.    </li>
      <li>The price for this mascara is on the higher end of the scale</li>
      <li>and it was the first time I ordered it online.</li>
      <li>I should admit - and the last time :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Will most definitely by again and again.</li>
      <li>Funny because the paper wrapped around it didn&#x27;t show any signs of damage.  </li>
      <li>While it is a nice product; it is harder to wash off than the show.  </li>
      <li>I prefer a more natural (not thick or clumpy)</li>
      <li>was my first time purchasing this mascara from this site.</li>
      <li>which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>stays on all day long and comes off easily with make up remover, so it won&#x27;t damage your eyelashes!</li>
      <li>The price point is high, but IMO worth it.</li>
      <li>Other than that- a great product overall</li>
      <li>and I dont have to put a large amount of coats on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all there is a new Brush available in the stores and its&#x27; a really old version.</li>
      <li>,I would not recommend it for short and fine lashes</li>
      <li>This mascara seems a little lighter in texture and the brush is nice for separating lashes.  </li>
      <li>I like a mascara that really emphasizes the lashes without having to put on a lot of coats.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t make that much difference</li>
      <li>When I use it it goes on very clumpy.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump as much as Dior Show Blackout because the brush is plastic.</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>But the shipper was very timely just not a fan of the product.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump over time or with multiple coats, it thickens and lengthens, it feels so smooth going on.</li>
      <li>and I still checked many other products</li>
      <li>It looks amazing on its own, but after using an eyelash curler, it definitely does make me look like I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes.</li>
      <li>My lashes are long, but light, and this mascara makes them stand out.  </li>
      <li>But other wise it does curl the lashes a bit and makes them long.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really good mascara.  Never clumps and gives your lashes a clean coating.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to give much of a dramatic effect though, so I&#x27;d think this would work better for daytime use.</li>
    <li> Best mascara every! Long defined lapses just as I&#x27;ve heard and the reason for me ordering. No clumps either. I love that. This is the perfect mascara, and I have tried a LOT of them too but none can top this. Will most definitely by again and again. Best price from this seller as well! :)</li>
    <li> Worth the cost, you will never go back to your old mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It outshines, outlashes and outlasts the rest of the competition.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mascara based upon some reviews that I had read in online magazines, but I am so disappointed with it.  I like a mascara that really emphasizes the lashes without having to put on a lot of coats.  This is not one of those mascaras.  Putting it in the best light possible, it gives a much more natural-looking lash.  Honestly, I have to put on several coats before I can tell that I&#x27;m even wearing anything.  If I want something like that I&#x27;d go out and buy a cheap mascara at the drugstore.  Actually, I take that back because the cheap drugstore mascaras that I&#x27;ve tried in the past were better than this mascara coverage-wise.  I gotta give this product credit, though, because after several coats it looks pretty good.  It doesn&#x27;t get too clumpy and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it smudging, which is why I gave it 3 stars and not 2 or 1.  Oh and the actual brush itself is gigantic.  It takes some practice to get used to it.  I would not waste my money on this mascara again.    Oh and on a side note, I purchased this mascara from Sephora through Amazon.  Shipping took forever and the box was damaged upon arrival.  Funny because the paper wrapped around it didn&#x27;t show any signs of damage.  Like they sent me a damaged box thinking I would blame it on the shipping.  No big deal because the product in the box was not damaged.  But kinda annoying.</li>
    <li> I was using Dior Show for a while, and even wrote a review about it, but after trying Iconic, I think I like Iconic a little better.  I have been using it for about 8 months now.  It lengthens my lashes, curls and defines them.  It doesn&#x27;t clump as much as Dior Show Blackout because the brush is plastic. I apply mascara every day, and wash it off at night with warm water and Dove body soap.  it doesn&#x27;t run off or give me raccoon eyes.  Never pump the mascara brush in and out of the bottle! This introduces air inside and dries out the mascara faster.  Instead, just lift the wand out slightly and twirl it around inside the bottle.  Also, what I do that I find helpful is that while I&#x27;m applying the mascara, I take a small piece of aluminum foil and cover the opening of the mascara bottle to help it not dry out.  My lashes are long, but light, and this mascara makes them stand out.  People have asked me several times if my lashes are fake.</li>
    <li> I typically purchase the dior show mascara and wondered if the iconic would be better than the show. While it is a nice product; it is harder to wash off than the show.  But other wise it does curl the lashes a bit and makes them long. If you want to add another coat to it; make sure and do it while it&#x27;s still wet, it does tend to clup up a little.</li>
    <li> As an asian female, I haven&#x27;t been fortunate enough to be born with long eyelashes. Without mascara, my eyelashes are short, sad and stubby. Enter Diorshow. I really liked the classic Diorshow mascara, as it lengthened my pathetically short eyelashes and gave them volume as well.    When I heard that Iconic was around, I jumped at the opportunity and got a tube and haven&#x27;t really been disappointed. It&#x27;s a great product, and I feel that the main difference between Iconic and the original is the wand. Iconic has a smaller, more pliable plastic brush, whereas the original Diorshow has a giant wand with lots of large bristles.    Iconic does it what it promises, it curls my rod-straight lashes and it doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake. It looks amazing on its own, but after using an eyelash curler, it definitely does make me look like I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes. Lovely!    The reason that I haven&#x27;t given it the full five stars, however, is because of the fact that it dries really quickly. I can put on maybe two or three coats before it dries, and after it dries I get those horrible spider legs that no one wants.    In summary, it&#x27;s a great product, just stick with a coat or two, not too much more than that.</li>
    <li> This mascara rivals falsies when combined with eyeliner on the upper lid. It is also easy to take off with makeup remover - easier than Dior Show in my experience.</li>
    <li> For the price the mascara is horrible. It clumps and rubs off. You can buy much better mascara for way cheaper. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this choice. But the shipper was very timely just not a fan of the product.</li>
    <li> I am always on the hunt for the perfect mascara and this one is my favorite.  I have tried several mascaras in the Dior line and I think this is the best one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is thick with a lot of bristles which does a great job of catching your lashes.  I usually use 2-3 coats and this mascara does not leave lumps behind or make your lashes clump together.  An added benefit is if I&#x27;m in a rush, I can skip curling my eyelashes first since this mascara does a pretty good job all by itself.  The color is dark black and makes my thin lashes appear thicker without overdoing it.  The best part - no smudges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use mascara for 6-7 months and despite heavy usage, I have never run out. The price for this mascara is on the higher end of the scale but you do get what you pay for.  I have tried bargain brands (Maybelline Great Lash) but never get the same flawless results.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara a couple weeks ago.  When I use it it goes on very clumpy.  When I take it off, it does not all come off!  It take about 2 days for all of the mascara to come off.  It does not say waterproof but acts as a waterproof mascara.  I would buy a different mascara, this one is not good and the company I bought if from does not get back to you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even feel like I need to say anything else. I&#x27;m on my 2nd tube. It&#x27;s amazing. It doesn&#x27;t clump over time or with multiple coats, it thickens and lengthens, it feels so smooth going on. It&#x27;s luxurious. It LASTS. It&#x27;s also better than Dior&#x27;s other mascaras, which are thicker and have spindly brushes, as opposed to a nice full one. This is my most expensive makeup item, but I&#x27;m never buying another drugstore mascara - and almost all my products are from the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the original DiorShow mascara, and I love trying new things, so I gave the DiorShow Iconic Mascara Noir a try.  I am not happy with it.  Despite the different techniques I use to apply it, it leaves my lashes in clumps.  When I try separating them using a clean mascara brush (a trick I learned from a makeup artist), it flakes off and I lose any lengthening effects.  I will be going back to the DiorShow mascara.</li>
    <li> This mascara is well worth the price.  It&#x27;s the best, and I&#x27;ve tried many different brands- no clumping, no smearing, doesn&#x27;t make lashes feel stiff, etc.  Really the best!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if Dior changed its formula, but what I got was a sticky, clumpy mess.  Also, the regular Iconic used to put a really nice curl in my lashes.  (Not so, the iconic curling mascara for some reason.)</li>
    <li> Very good！&lt;br /&gt;A good Mascara</li>
    <li> the most amazing mascara I&#x27;ve ever had! stays on all day long and comes off easily with make up remover, so it won&#x27;t damage your eyelashes!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy! Very disappointed! After few weeks of using the brush went completely flat! I mean flat!!! No spikes! Will never buy again!</li>
    <li> This was gross te seal was broken, and its the wrong color I ordered. I ordered black and got a blue purple color..I threw it right away in the trash...obviously been open before...GROSS!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST mascara ever! I never wore mascara, except on special occasions, now i wear it every day! It doesn&#x27;t give you &#x27;raccoon eyes&#x27; if you don&#x27;t take it off before bed and it looks very natural, but dramatic at the same time. I LOVE this mascara. It was worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> Love the look but when applying I experienced excess mascara on the brush causing clumping on my eyelashes.  Need to \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; it off before applying then looks great.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Doesn&#x27;t flake or clump. Must use eye makeup remover to take off. A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> love the way it applys and looks a friend told me about it and her lashes are so luscious thxs!</li>
    <li> Most amazing mascara ever!!! Hard to wash off but makes your eyelashes look AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> Quick application and very good coverage which is exactly what I was looking for. Worth the money and I  will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I tried many different brands and this one makes your lashes long and thick without destroying them! I have been using this for the past 3 years and I still checked many other products but I always come back to Dior.</li>
    <li> My go-to mascara these days.  I&#x27;ve always liked Dior mascara and used DiorShow for a long time. This mascara seems a little lighter in texture and the brush is nice for separating lashes.  I prefer a more natural (not thick or clumpy) look these days and this mascara and brush work well for me.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. It goes on great- thick enough without looking THICK and I dont have to put a large amount of coats on. It doesnt flake off like my other mascaras have- which is a HUGE plus for me- that was so irritating finding flakes on my face all the time. The only small issue for me is that it is a little hard to get off- so sometimes I have to wash my eyes twice when removing my makeup. Other than that- a great product overall and I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used Dior; my previous experience with the brand was with Diorshow Blackout.  I&#x27;m still unsure of which one I prefer.  Regardless, they both are awesome!  Diorshow mascara doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love, Love,Love it!!! Makes your lashes super long AND super thick. Does NOT flake, smear or or even run too much if you happen to cry :-) The PERFECT mascara!!!!</li>
    <li> The brush design makes this the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve never had this mascara flake off either.</li>
    <li> Love it. After trying just about every brand there is in the drugstore I finally found one that doesn&#x27;t clump, flake or feel too heavy on my lashes.</li>
    <li> My new favorite mascara. Not sure i will ever go back to anything else! If you try it you will definitely be addicted.</li>
    <li> I have been using CD Iconic Mascara for years and it was the first time I ordered it online. I should admit - and the last time :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all there is a new Brush available in the stores and its&#x27; a really old version. Second - I am not sure it was real CD. It looked different on my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not the worst part. It was very dry. So I could use it for 3-4 weeks only. At the end of those weeks it already looked terrible. I usually can use it for 3 months.</li>
    <li> I liked the color and consistency of this mascara, but didn&#x27;t notice it to be any better than those I could buy much cheaper in a drugstore. One downside for me which may actually be a plus for others, was that it stayed on too well. Meaning, when I used makeup remover, it still clung to my lashes and I woke up with black circles under my eyes from residual product. But if you have a problem with your mascara coming off too soon, this will definitely remedy that for you!</li>
    <li> I have been using Dior Diorshow Iconic Mascara Noir for several years and have always been very happy with the product. The brush head has row after row of tiny combs that coats and defines every lash.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time purchasing this mascara from this site. What arrived was not the same product I last purchased 5 months ago at my local mall. It didn&#x27;t even closely resemble my favorite mascara. One star off for having to return it.</li>
    <li> I had to see what all the excitement was about. It is nicer than a drugstore mascara, and worth the price. But for someone with not a whole lot of lashes, and who doesn&#x27;t wear mascara often, the extra large brush is a bit unwieldy. (Think brushing your teeth with a hairbrush!) I&#x27;m ready to try the Dior mascara with the narrow wand, which might be easier for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product specifically for the &amp;#34;curling&amp;#34; factor.  I didn&#x27;t want to use my eyelash curler.  The product covers well but does not curl my lashes.  A much less expensive mascara can cover well.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. I have ten dollar mascaras that work just as well. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 so have tried a gazillion brands. I just tried this for the first time a few months ago, and am now an evangelistic convert. Why? No flaking. Great definition and lengthening of lashes in just two quick coats. Long staying power, through the day and night without smudging. Despite long staying power easy to remove with good quality remover. And my favorite, I dont have sensitivity to the ingredients. I notice this product is less waxy than some brands, and my lashes dont clump as a result. Lashes also dont feel stiff. The price point is high, but IMO worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! The item arrives promptly and I have since ordered it for two of my best friend&#x27;s birthday gifts!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t show at all, bad brush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does dry fast and doesn&#x27;t clump, but water does so much too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting some covering from DIOR...bad choice,I would not recommend it for short and fine lashes</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t make that much difference</li>
</ol>
