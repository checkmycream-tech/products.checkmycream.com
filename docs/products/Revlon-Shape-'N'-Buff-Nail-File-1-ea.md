### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are wonderful!  </li>
      <li>I consider it &amp;#34;one of the best things in the world&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>They would be perfect, if they were not all falling apart.</li>
      <li>great product-hard to find in stores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this product</li>
      <li>Great nail file, versatile.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good weight and fits great in my hand when I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
      <li>Good price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and they are still my favorite!</li>
      <li>So glad Amazon still carries them!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s nice for travel.</li>
      <li>The item is handy to hold during the shaping and buffing.</li>
      <li>The foam pad around the sides has a very fine filing capability, for creating the nail edge I need for guitar.</li>
      <li>This product would be much better if it did not include the two emery board surfaces.  </li>
      <li>Better ones in Walmart.</li>
      <li>Glad to find on Amazon-hard to locate in a lot of stores.  </li>
      <li>I love the six separate areas of varying textures.</li>
      <li>Really like this product and great for travel.    </li>
      <li>pleased with result.</li>
      <li>Easy to use &amp; keep those nails in line.  </li>
      <li>I am a classical guitarist, and this tool is perfect for keeping nails at the right length and shaping them for playing.</li>
      <li>There is some issue with the glue that holds on the outer buff and fine filing pads which are wrapped around the side edges.</li>
      <li>finally i have many of these and glad i could find it online!</li>
      <li>I tried using some super glue, and it didn&#x27;t work with these foam pads.</li>
      <li>Result is very shiny glassy smooth nails.    </li>
      <li>I play classical guitar and these are my favorite finger nail files.</li>
      <li>Exactly as shown.</li>
      <li>but I could see how the Speed Buff product would be nice to have because it doesn&#x27;t have a rough surface.  </li>
      <li>I bought my first Shape-N-Buff at the local drug store and since then have recommended it to friends and have purchased more for family members.</li>
      <li>These are wonderful, long lasting, and terrific.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to slip and hit the surface of your nail with the rough surfaces.</li>
      <li>The black side is a coarse grit that rapidly reduces the length of nails and is perfect for filing tough toenails; the white side is a very fine grit that is good for daily maintenance of nail tips.</li>
      <li>And this side pad also has 4 different levels of sanding/ filing... from fine to polishing.</li>
      <li>Other than this quality issue, I love these files and would have given them 5 stars.</li>
      <li>This buffer works very well to shape, buff, and shine natural nails, and holds up much better than other buffers I have tried.</li>
      <li>6 high quality shape and buffers...</li>
      <li>Difficult and not even great results for all the effort.  </li>
      <li>The sides of the tool are divided into four colored sections that are numbered sequentially for smoothing the surfaces of nails and progressing to the final polishing step that makes nails look freshly polished.</li>
      <li>One side helps smooth out ridges while the other buffs and shines.   </li>
      <li>However, it lasted longer and gave a better shine than the several other buffers I have tried.</li>
      <li>When I bought the first Revlon Shape-N-Buff, I expected it to wear out quickly, because the surfaces are not very big.</li>
      <li>As a professional finger style guitarist I depend on these things.</li>
      <li>Got one over a year ago at a store-it&#x27;s still very useful (used every few days).</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used clear nail polish or remover since my initial use of this tool.</li>
      <li>so i&#x27;ve been using my old one for so long.</li>
      <li>These work very well on wet or dry nails.</li>

<li> I have used Revlon Shape-N-Buff for a long time, but had a problem getting replacements.  </li>
<li> I purchased the pack of 6 and when I received them, one side of the nail file did not have any markings--the color was pink and blue, but no markings.  </li>
<li> They are complete trash and a waste of money.  </li>
<li> Also, one of the wrap arounds was coming loose.  </li>
<li> They did not come in retail packaging, as advertised by the photos, but were instead loose inside a plastic bag.</li>
<li> One coarse side for filing down nails or for callouses   </li>
<li> One side for shaping nails and smoothing rough spots     </li>
<li> My last few orders have arrived with the buffing surfaces already falling off without me having even used them.  </li>
<li> However the central portion of the buffer is rather weak and may break after several uses.</li>
<li> The description said &amp;#34;Pack of 6&amp;#34;, and, after asking to other buyers, I was convinced that the order came with 6 items, not just one.</li>
<li> The other two sides are divided into two sections:   </li>
<li> it is too wide to work with and really does a lousy job.</li>
<li> I buy these all the time but have a hard time finding them locally.</li>
<li> Other brands fall apart in no time, but not this one!</li>
<li> the drug stores are now carrying the cheap imitation ones, and I hate them.</li>
<li> Now, the Shape-N-Buff have gotten hard to find</li>
<li> It has been increasingly hard to find, so I latched on to the chance to order a six-pack from Amazon.</li>
<li> Very poor quality control.</li>
<li> Too expensive!</li>
<li> Needless to say, I was disappointed.</li>

    <li> I play classical guitar and these are my favorite finger nail files.</li>
    <li> Really like this product and great for travel.    4 sided (divided into four buffing sections and two shaping)   One coarse side for filing down nails or for callouses   One side for shaping nails and smoothing rough spots     The other two sides are divided into two sections:   One side helps smooth out ridges while the other buffs and shines.   Result is very shiny glassy smooth nails.    Only downside is that your nails could potentially hit the rough side while your buffing.  This hasn&#x27;t happened to me but I could see how the Speed Buff product would be nice to have because it doesn&#x27;t have a rough surface.  I&#x27;m really happy with this product and it&#x27;s nice for travel.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my niece.  She gave me one and I stopped biting my nails!  Been using them ever since.  Even hooked my mother on them.</li>
    <li> They did not come in retail packaging, as advertised by the photos, but were instead loose inside a plastic bag. And all of them have been falling apart. There is some issue with the glue that holds on the outer buff and fine filing pads which are wrapped around the side edges. Very poor quality control. I tried using some super glue, and it didn&#x27;t work with these foam pads. Other than this quality issue, I love these files and would have given them 5 stars. I am a classical guitarist, and this tool is perfect for keeping nails at the right length and shaping them for playing. The foam pad around the sides has a very fine filing capability, for creating the nail edge I need for guitar. And this side pad also has 4 different levels of sanding/ filing... from fine to polishing. They would be perfect, if they were not all falling apart.</li>
    <li> Great nail file, versatile.  Easy to use &amp; keep those nails in line.  Buff &amp; shine as well with no toxic lacquer! 4 sides: 1-2-3-4 to file &amp; make them pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need for those potentially injurious manicure tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with result. Got one over a year ago at a store-it&#x27;s still very useful (used every few days). Glad to find on Amazon-hard to locate in a lot of stores.  Good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Exactly as shown. 6 high quality shape and buffers... the drug stores are now carrying the cheap imitation ones, and I hate them. These are wonderful, long lasting, and terrific.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful!  I use them all the time to reshape my nails, fix/prevent breakage and buff them.  It&#x27;s a good weight and fits great in my hand when I&#x27;m using it.  I bought the pack of 6 and I think they will last me a very long time (if I can keep my friends from stealing them!).</li>
    <li> The description said &amp;#34;Pack of 6&amp;#34;, and, after asking to other buyers, I was convinced that the order came with 6 items, not just one.</li>
    <li> used once and threw away the rest. Better ones in Walmart. it is too wide to work with and really does a lousy job.</li>
    <li> When I bought the first Revlon Shape-N-Buff, I expected it to wear out quickly, because the surfaces are not very big. However, it lasted longer and gave a better shine than the several other buffers I have tried. Now, the Shape-N-Buff have gotten hard to find so I bought a 6-pack.</li>
    <li> I have found nothing else that compares to these! So glad Amazon still carries them! I would recommend them to anyone looking for a file!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they are still my favorite! Other brands fall apart in no time, but not this one!</li>
    <li> could not find at target so i&#x27;ve been using my old one for so long. finally i have many of these and glad i could find it online!</li>
    <li> This buffer works very well to shape, buff, and shine natural nails, and holds up much better than other buffers I have tried.</li>
    <li> These work very well on wet or dry nails. However, the nails seem to grow back quicker (I find myself having to use it once a week vs every 10 to 14 days with clippers) and the corner of the nail is pointier.</li>
    <li> I buy these all the time but have a hard time finding them locally. I love the six separate areas of varying textures.</li>
    <li> This product would be much better if it did not include the two emery board surfaces.  It is very easy to slip and hit the surface of your nail with the rough surfaces. My nails, though shiny and better shaped, look worse than before because now I have bunch of scratches on them!  Not only this, but already the surface of the white emery is peeling off in a couple spots where I hit it while buffing.  Difficult and not even great results for all the effort.  Too expensive! Would give it a zero if I could have.</li>
    <li> As a professional finger style guitarist I depend on these things. I use to swear by them and order them by the dozen.  My last few orders have arrived with the buffing surfaces already falling off without me having even used them.  They are complete trash and a waste of money.  I&#x27;ve switched to graded wood polishing cloth and buffer blocks.</li>
    <li> great product-hard to find in stores.</li>

I haven&#x27;t used clear nail polish or remover since my initial use of this tool. I consider it &amp;#34;one of the best things in the world&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> They were not individually wrapped.  Came in bulk of six individual .  The edge strip was coming off on all of them.  Not as advertised.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used Revlon Shape-N-Buff for a long time, but had a problem getting replacements.  I purchased the pack of 6 and when I received them, one side of the nail file did not have any markings--the color was pink and blue, but no markings.

    <li> The item is handy to hold during the shaping and buffing. However the central portion of the buffer is rather weak and may break after several uses. My is already bent after using it thrixe</li>
