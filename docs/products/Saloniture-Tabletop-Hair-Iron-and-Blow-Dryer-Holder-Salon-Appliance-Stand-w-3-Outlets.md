<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is such a life saver. Makes doing my hair a breeze. Great when clients come over too!</li>
    <li> This works amazing for my salon.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve had this item for a couple of weeks now and I really love it!  It helps make my vanity table look organized!  The item is pretty heavy duty.  I have my hairdryer and my flat iron in it and there are no problems.  I really can&#x27;t say anything about the curling iron spots since I don&#x27;t have any curling irons to put in there.  I have a larger flat iron, so my flat iron uses both slots for the flat iron.  I have not had any issues with any melting.  My flat iron has sit in the holder while on at a temperature of 400 degrees and there hasn&#x27;t been any melting.  I&#x27;m very glad that I spent a few extra dollars to get the one with the plugs on the front, that allows me to have extra reach with my hair dryer and flat iron when using them.</li>
    <li> This item is not what I expected.  I am a hair stylist and needed something to put my hot tools in and keep the tools in there while still on...so while I was working and curling someone&#x27;s hair, my curling iron burnt a hole in the plastic and the plastic melted all over my expensive curling iron!!!  I immediately came to Amazon to return the item and of course I am 2 days late to return it, so now I am out my $25 and now I have to buy another curling iron and have a custom hot tool holder made!!!  It is sturdy and it has rubber feet to stay where you put it, but I don&#x27;t know why they didn&#x27;t make it with metal inserts!!!  Also, it would be nice if it was bigger and had enough outlets to house all the appliances that it can hold, to me this was not thought out very well.  Booooo!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and needed! I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I don&#x27;t like a lot of clutter on my station so this is a way for me to have only what I need at hand. Only negative thing is that I thought the curling iron slots were slightly larger but they do the job too</li>
    <li> Such a good buy. I&#x27;m very organized so this was perfect for me. Great price. The only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the fact that the spot for the hair dryer is a little small for my hair dryer to stay put. It likes to fall out. Not going to be the case for everyone. Would recommend this if you&#x27;re a little ocd like me and want a place for everything.</li>
    <li> Works great, nice and heavy duty</li>
    <li> Helps keep me organized and fits all of my tools!</li>
    <li> This is a quality product. For me personally, I wish it were larger and could store more, but yet the compactness of the product is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely enhances my restroom area...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Company shipped FAST and item was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Love it keep everything organized. 5 stars</li>
    <li> Best thing ever. Wish the curling iron/wand openings came a little larger.</li>
    <li> Got this for my gf because her blow dryers, flat irons, and curling irons are everywhere.  Was looking for something to organize them and found this, which was perfect.  It&#x27;s a heavy material to keep everything upright and the included outlet is helpful. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter but had to return it as her blow dryer and curling iron were too big for the holes. Too bad, this is a great product but can be better if the holes were slightly bigger.</li>
    <li> Wonderful station to have at home.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Works great! Love it!</li>
    <li> Just what me and my daughters needed. I&#x27;m so happy and pleased with this product. It came I&#x27;m handy and is so convenient to have on the dresser to do our hair. Don&#x27;t like hair in my bathroom so in their room we do our hair. Everything is right there turned on and hot ready to be used when you get ready and don&#x27;t have to worry about the cords being to short because you can plug your curlers, flat irons and blow dryer all at once. Love it!_!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe they would make a metal holder with plastic inserts!  What&#x27;s the point?  I want to have my irons hot and ready to use  This was a gift that now I will have to ask for a receipt to return.  I will look pretty foolish since I was the one who looked on line and said this was the one I wanted.  Please either state that the holder is not all metal or rethink your design.  What a waste of my time</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  She set it up in her work station doing professional hair styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a well made piece of equipment, and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> The one I recently bought is a Christmas gift.  I have owned one myself for 2 years and absolutely love it. I read the other comments about the iron melting the plastic.  I store brushes(handles down)in the small circular holes and my blow dryer in the large hole, so have never placed a hot curling iron in the holes.  I leave my hot iron turned on in the holder (and have accidently left on all day) and have never had the plastic melt. I would recommend this item if used as I do.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s small and makes everything convenient. Gives me so much more room on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Its great and heavy enough to stay put, altho&#x27; I did put screws thru the holes to secure it.  I wish there was just one larger flat-iron hole, I can&#x27;t use either of these small ones, but it is still a very handy holder.</li>
    <li> Great piece of Salon equipment. Unfortunately it did not fit with all of the curling irons I had. If you have mostly smaller irons, this will work great.</li>
    <li> Works just as promised!</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it. I wish there was something that could allow congruency of different utensils regardless of brand, but its still pretty nice.</li>
    <li> Just what we were looking for. This holder is solid and well made and love the fact that the outlets are right on it.</li>
    <li> I was actually very surprised at the quality of this product after reading some reviews of this. but I took a chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did! It&#x27;s really very sturdy. I thought it would be wobbly, but it isn&#x27;t at all! I put my Paul Mitchell straightener in it and it fits snug (won&#x27;t fit bigger that 1&amp;#34;) I have my Paul Mitchell neuron dryer in it, fits great, I just have to take the concentrator off the end of the dryer. And I put my Paul Mitchell neuron wand curler with its other 2 attachments in the holes. Perfect! When I set it up at my station the other girls were raving over it! And I had my straightener on inside and it didn&#x27;t melt. It&#x27;s composite, not regular plastic. A real winner! Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> Even sturdier than I thought it would be. Works perfect</li>
    <li> very strurdy and convenient</li>
    <li> Love it! It keeps my stuff organized nicely on my vanity and I love that it has extra plugs!</li>
    <li> Review from a licensed hairdresser working from home: Two positives: Heavy weight, yet easy to tote from room to room and the price was low. Two negatives: The hairdryer hole is not large enough to accommodate most attachment nozzles, which is irritating. I wish the item had a storage area for wide combs, but that&#x27;s my personal preference and was not advertised as part of the deal. Worth the money! The day before the item arrived, I managed to burn my countertop with a curling iron and wished I&#x27;d ordered the thing a day earlier!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that the multiple barrel size options for the curling irons would accommodate the large barreled curling irons I use - 1&amp;#34;, 1.5&amp;#34;, 1.75&amp;#34;. None of my curling irons fit into the barrels. I don&#x27;t use flat irons, so I put my brushes in the spaces next to where the blow-dryer sits. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s useful for holding my blow-dryer, it works well enough to house my brushes, and I really like the 3 electrical cord outlet on the front to save wall outlet space.</li>
    <li> Product is a described...heavy metal...I&#x27;m sending back because too large for my bathroom counter top and too heavy for the wall.&lt;br /&gt;I am considering giveing it to my hairdresser as a gift...You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This is such a great idea for organize all the styling tools that I use often.  It is sturdy and my bathroom counter has remained organized since I&#x27;ve had it.  I love it!</li>
    <li> The holes are too little to fit any blow dryer or flat irons in. I have to send it back for a refund. :(</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of this unit to organize my many style options.  This is heavy enough and it&#x27;s great to have the extra plugs but that is where my positives end.  The holes for the flat irons are not big enough or deep enough, my hair dryer didn&#x27;t fit in the main hole and only one of my curling irons fit but the holes are not long enough so every time i move one thing the other things fall right out. Its a good start on an idea but needs lots of improvements to fit my needs,</li>
    <li> The holes for the curling irons are not quite large enough, other than that, this is a great piece for storing and using your hair accessories, especially with the plug on the front.</li>
    <li> Love it. and having the outlets right on it are wonderful! Will definitely tell friends and family about this product!</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for a 13yr old niece and she loves it and appreciates the gift so much!</li>
    <li> There is not much to say about it, you get exactly what is pictured. I thought it to be a little expensive, however, considering you can plug in additional items (a blow dryer, straightener and Ott-lite natural mirror) it was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Item just as described and arrived super fast!!</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I expected which was a good thing! They used to be big bulky boxes ....and with the plugs on the front makes everything easily accessible!</li>
    <li> This is a very heavy duty/sturdy holder.  I would have liked the blow dryer area to be a little bit larger so it would fit with my attachments on, but besides that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I like the set up, but I have no idea why they made the inserts platic. I&#x27;m afraid to use them with hot tools, which is the entire reason for buying it.</li>
    <li> It fits my tools perfectly! Just wish there was a place for the cords to go. Nice size.</li>
    <li> Very nice and well built. The only thing is the flat iron slots are not large enough for a thick flat iron but do well with the thinner ones</li>
    <li> I purchased this to keep the girlfriend from melting anymore of my counter space.  I don&#x27;t have granite counters so everytime she forgets to unplug her straightener or curler my counters melt, this thing does the trick, I also got one of those ten dollar 60 minute timed outlet plugs that I plugged this thing into, that way, even if she doesn&#x27;t re-holster her hair tools the timer will hopefully keep the house from burning down.</li>
    <li> The blow dryer cannot rest in its designated place. Also the largest of the 3 holes on the side is too small for our largest curling iron</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly and exactly as it was advertised.  I immediately set it up and it is perfect!  Takes up little room but does the job intended!  Love this product and would recommend this to others to purchase!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great organizer for the shop or in home use.</li>
    <li> This little holder is great! It&#x27;s small, which is perfect for my vanity. It&#x27;s also heavy and sturdy.  I love having the plugs on top of my vanity instead of below on the floor. I wish it had a spot for a 2 inch curler, but the hairdryer area can be used for that if needed. Definitely a great product and worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love the additional power outlets on the front.</li>
    <li> Very nice, heavy duty. Bought this for my teen daughter to help her organize her dressing table.  The 3 outlets are very helpful since she has a straightener, blow dryer, and a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I love it. It keeps my straightener and 2 curling irons (1 1/4&amp;#34; &amp; 1&amp;#34;)  off my dresser. It does not fit my blow dryer, so I am looking into getting a new dryer.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Helped clean up my bathroom counter.  I don&#x27;t use a flat iron so for that part I place my different combs and picks.  Would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Holds appliances well. Wish it had a place for cords.</li>
    <li> I use this in my station for all my haircuts and it does just what I need it to.  Love the plugs on the front.</li>
    <li> Meets every expectation.  Very helpful with several hair appliances.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous way to keep hair tools handy and ready.  It&#x27;s sturdy and relatively heavy so holds in place great.  It also plugs into the wall outlet and allows you to plug in all your items in the front which keeps it handy.  Yes, the inserts are plastic, but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue at all.  The only complaint I have is that the cords get all over the place and can rest on the hot elements if you&#x27;re not careful. Would be nice to have some kind of gadget on it to organize the cords or better if they plugged in in the back.</li>
    <li> Openings are a bit too small. Blow dryer won&#x27;t fit with small attachment on  and won&#x27;t fit on it&#x27;s butt either. Concept is great and so is outlet on front. I&#x27;m still using it, even though it&#x27;s an awkward fit, but I would love if the company engineered one with larger openings for todays appliance sizes. I would definitely buy it.</li>
    <li> works great!  Perfect fit inside my upper bathroom cabinet.Good quality and value for the price.</li>
    <li> Wanted to put on wall but tools would not stay in holder so I put it on my dresser.</li>
    <li> Best thing since apple pie! Would highly recommend! Makes life so much easier.  I have to blow dry and straighten my hair.Makes easy availability and having the outlets is such an added bonus . Bought a vanity and sit and do my hair!  Buy it ladies ! You will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> Oh, this thing. The description states the largest hole is 2 5/8&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a two-inch hole. I have a Conair IonShine which is a really standard hair dryer and it does NOT fit. Whattawaste.</li>
    <li> Curling iron holes are not big enough to hold 1 1/2 irons</li>
    <li> Great concept, bad follow through.  All the holes are too small.  They are only made for 1 1/2 in curling iron or smaller and they catch on each other if you have more than one.  Blow dryer fits as long as you remove all attachments.  Flat iron doesn&#x27;t fit anywhere.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I like the way it help organized the counter.</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of this product....but the holes for marcels are not deep enough and I&#x27;m not sure of the hole for the hair dryer yet, but it looks mighty small. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be returning this item.</li>
    <li> This item works well for keeping my hot irons off the countertop.  It is VERY heavy, so won&#x27;t tip over.  There are plugs in the front to keep everything plugged in and ready to go.  I wish the plugs were on the side, but it&#x27;s really not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> Holes need to be larger to accommodate large barrel brush irons. Like outlets on front but need to be farther spaced and 5 instead of 3</li>
    <li> Wife loves it! Sturdy, heavy enough that it doesn&#x27;t topple over. Arrived timely!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who lives out of state. She just called me to say how wonderful it is, very heavy duty and professional lt looks.</li>
    <li> This item is really small. Fits my blow dryer and that&#x27;s about it. I don&#x27;t use very many 1/8 or 1/4 inch curling irons so the iron holders do me no good. It&#x27;s sturdy and the electrical part is great but not economical for a fast paced environment where you need lots of versatility.</li>
    <li> I am not pleased with the size of the curling irons holes.  I didn&#x27;t dig far enough to see the sizes, but my smallest curling iron(~1/2&amp;#34;) fits into the largest hole in the three on the right side. I don&#x27;t even know if they sell curling irons small enough to fit into the other two holes?!! I tried to return it, but it was going to cost me almost the same amount that I paid for it to send it back...so I was forced to keep it.  The electrical outlet function is great.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, works well. I use one of the flat iron holders to hold my blow dryer diffuser.</li>
    <li> This Item came quickly and undamaged.  The hair dryer hole could be a bit deeper, but it still works.  I put a comb and a brush in the curling iron holes since I only have one iron which works great.  This organizer does help keep the counter less cluttered although you still have many cords to deal with; however, I tucked them behind the back.  This unit cost much less than some of the other appliance organizers, so I am happy.</li>
    <li> A pro flat iron doesn&#x27;t fit securely. It keeps on falling out which is annoying and a safety hazard. I like that it has the plugs and I still use it for the smaller curling iron but a 2&amp;#34; barrel can&#x27;t fit either. Wish it would have been a bit more effective.</li>
    <li> i love this! it is much sturdier than it looks in this photo. it makes my vanity look ultra organized. i have in mine: 2 flatirons, hair dryer, curling wand and curling iron. some of the comments said that it was made of plastic, but it almost feels like metal, not plastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only getting 3 stars because I like it! It works well but the Flatiron keeps falling off the blow dryer fits well but not curling irons and flat irons fall off</li>
    <li> Received timely and it was just what I expected!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted, fits perfectly and keeps my appliances organized.  The front panel electrical outlet is great for additional power for all my accessories; they can be left plugged in and ready to use.</li>
    <li> A girl from school liked mine so much she had me order her one. Our outlets are way under the counter so this makes it much more convenient to plug in our irons and blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mobile Bridal Hairstylist and I highly recommend this table top holder. It&#x27;s made well and is quite sturdy. Having the electrical built in is awesome.. Beats having to carry around the extension cord. Lol&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Bought it for my sister as a Christmas gift. She is a cosmetologist and she absolutely loved it! It was shipped and receive fast! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is such a great concept, frees up counter space , and provides an electrical outlet as a plus.</li>
    <li> As pictured, good price, fast delivery however i couldnt use it for what i needed due to sleeves being plastic. If used for storage i would recommend.</li>
    <li> I read the previous comments but didn&#x27;t believe that it would surely have a &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; size opening for the blow-dryer.  The rest of the openings for the Curling Iron and hair Flat Iron were fine, but what&#x27;s the point if you can&#x27;t have it all!  I tried 3 different Blow dryers to no avail.  Good concept, poor development.</li>
    <li> This item works perfectly. I designed me cabinet to be deep enough and had an electrical outlet added inside so I could keep my hair tools out of sight. I usually let the flat iron cool a bit before putting away because the insert is plastic. So far so good even when it goes in hot.</li>
    <li> These is good to keep your counters safe from marring. Keeps all hot irons in a safe place.</li>
    <li> I have a place for all my electric hair accessories now (hair dryer, straightener, curling iron), so much more room on my bathroom counter and I love the fact that it has 3 outlets as I only have one outlet in my bathroom.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that there is no place to put all the cords when you are not using them.  A great buy tho.</li>
    <li> As seen and described when ordered. Can&#x27;t use more than one hair appliance if with large GFC plug which makes it useless to plug more than one in. Good for storage but not use.</li>
    <li> Its really handy i love it</li>
    <li> Great quality. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Sturdy design, baked on powder coated finish. Wish they came in more colors.</li>
    <li> I love this. I needed a hot tools holder. This was cheap, and I liked the power outlets feature. Received quickly. It has a good, sturdy weight to it. There are mounting holes on the bottom, but I have yet to need them. I have a blow dryer and two flat irons in it. Plastic sleeves haven&#x27;t melted or warped due to heat, and I forget to turn off my flat iron all the time. Give me piece of mind. Also, the power extension cord from the built in outlets is fairly long. I thought I&#x27;d need to plug this into a surge strip, but it reaches just where I needed it to. I love this, absolutely love this.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be extremely durable.  I am pleased with the price and I&#x27;m very happy to have ordered it.  I don&#x27;t understand why my previous review was not allowed.  I didn&#x27;t do or say anything off.  I&#x27;m a little annoyed that my previous review was refused thus it was 5 stars and now 4 stars because I had to do another review.  Next time this happens I will not do another review.</li>
    <li> The product works great, and made of good material. I would recommend this to anyone who needs the storage space.</li>
    <li> I love how I can plug my tools in it. The grip pads on the bottom really helps keep it in place on my station and/or roll about cart. Adds a professional look to my station as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, well made, very sturdy. I was very pleased with the looks and quality of this product. However, my appliances did not fit it so I had to return them (I purchased 2 of them). I was very pleased with customer service. They were very polite and it was a pleasure doing business with them.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for organizing my stuff in the bathroom.  It doesn&#x27;t take up too much space and it adds extra outlets for all my curling irons.  My only critique is that the curling iron holes are too small.  My smallest diameter iron fits in the biggest hole, so I will have to make use of the other holes for something else.  My flat iron does fit in the long slot and I use the other one for hairbrushes.  I would definitely recommend this item!!  (Posted by Dave&#x27;s wife :))</li>
    <li> Smaller than anticipated but works great.</li>
    <li> I have not personally had any dealings with the item, but my girlfriend said it is awesome. Seems to be keeping the mess to a minimum. Mission accomplished.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stand along curling iron holder with built-in electrical outlets for 3 devices.  Sits firmly on my countertop and does not tip over.  Purchased it to replace a similar fiberglass stand which began to crack after a few years.  Yes - I definitely recommend if you don&#x27;t have a place to mount electrical utensils.</li>
    <li> It is fantastic! Got my bathroom counter top back! Great quality as well!</li>
    <li> I had not read the full description of this product and was so thrilled to see the outlets.  I love it!  I placed it on my vanity on a non-skid/grip drawer liner that I cut down to size.  It stays put while I&#x27;m wildly drying my hair.  What a net product!</li>
    <li> Works well and fits the purpose it implies. Takes up a bit of room, but not nearly as much as each single appliance would. Great for my dorm!</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would have been a little bigger  but I really like it. Good product.</li>
    <li> This item is much smaller than I expected. The only items that fit in any of the compartments were my blow dryer but only if I took the diffuser off and the smallest 1&amp;#34; flat iron I own. Most of the round parts on the side are useless because they are too small. I have a mini 1/2&amp;#34; curling iron that fit in the largest compartment.  I suppose if you use the smallest curling iron is available it might fit. I will say that it is heavy and made of good Solid materials. I am returning this item.</li>
    <li> No issues with heat transferring from hair tools. Outlet works on it. Keeps everything very organized.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I need it for. Compact, travels well, and the outlet is a fantastic addition.</li>
    <li> I like the product for my station at my suite salon work  it is perfect for the blow dry but the flat iron do not stay in place</li>
    <li> My bathroom countertop was a wreck...hair-styling tools, brushes and combs...now it&#x27;s neatly organized with Saloniture&#x27;s Tabletop organizer...what I really like about this product, compared to others, is that it&#x27;s metal and has the triple outlet for my hairdryer, flatiron, and curling brush.  Others I&#x27;ve seen were plastic or metal organizers that hang on the cabinet door or towel rack.  It&#x27;s definitely a quality made product and solved my problem!!</li>
    <li> This looks really stylish in my room and all of my siblings want to buy one. Leaves more room for other stuff on my dresser.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I purchased this. Now my irons and dryer are now organized. I also like the safety of no accidental burns because I can put my hot iron back into the holder while I&#x27;m styling. I also am very happy to have 3 outlets on the organizer. The only recommendation I have is that it would be nice to have options regarding the flat iron space. I don&#x27;t use flat irons so I would have like to have that space with a cup for holding hair spray or brushes/combs, etc. Maybe even the option of different size containers for that same area that could hold bobbi pins or hair clips. It is just wasted space for me and those that do not use flat irons. Ultimately, I do love this and recommend it!</li>
    <li> It is as described. Small. Plastic inserts are not an issue (I read someone thought this was an issue) they are made for heat. It is heavy, sturdy, made well. Just wish the outlets allowed room for larger plug ins.</li>
    <li> EXACTLY what I needed! I ordered this for home use. I live in a rent house so didn&#x27;t want to damage walls from hanging anything too heavy that might take some abuse from using it so often. My bathroom also has one, just ONE electrical outlet, so those 3 added plug-ins have saved me a ton of grief. I have it sitting on a side table against the wall where I get ready. Its just sitting there guys! It has holes underneath for mounting, but it&#x27;s made of such heavy, quality material, I never even had to mount it. That sucker doesn&#x27;t go anywhere! Price was great too, definitely got more than my moneys worth. And that doesn&#x27;t happen much these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to remember to go back and at least rate the products I get from Amazon, cuz I&#x27;m a huge fan of the reviews posted. They&#x27;re extremely helpful since they&#x27;re coming from the ones that actually USE the product. Who&#x27;d know better than the consumer? So yes, I rate the products, but I only take the time to actually write a review when I end up with something that&#x27;s either one extreme or the other........piece of crap OR somethin that I truly believe in, somethin that&#x27;s really blown my dress up! This product is definitely a great one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a bunch guys, love it!</li>
    <li> I love this, I don&#x27;t worry about the heat from my curling iron burning my table. Everything is in it&#x27;s place.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I wasn&#x27;t sure it would hold, thinking it might tip over. But I am pleased, it is very reliable and sturdy. I really like the plug in as well. So easy.</li>
    <li> it is really small. My babyliss iron falls out of it all the time. the holes on the right side suit very small curling irons fairly well. unless you hang this off the end of your station the blow dryer hole isn&#x27;t deep enough to hold a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This is great, however I guess I should have read the description. The holes for the curling irons are very small. I use 1 1/4-1 1/2&amp;#34;+ and they do not fit. The slots on the left, do not hold my hair straighteners either. I will keep it for the three plugs in the front.</li>
    <li> Works well!  It&#x27;s a great addition to my vanity.  The outlet I have is pretty low towards the floor and I had to crouch down every time to plug my blower in.  I&#x27;m glad that now I just had to plug this one in ONCE and I don&#x27;t have to worry about bending down to plug it in every time.  3 plugs directly on the vanity is so convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used my flat iron and blower on this, and use one of the curling iron holes to hold my round brush.  The only thing that I noticed is that the nozzle to my blower does not fit in the blower hole, so I have to take it off each time before putting the blower back in its place, but that is minor compared to the convenience of having it organized in one spot.</li>
    <li> Love this! Very convenient for my irons!</li>
    <li> Came on time and as advertised - thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality! Haven&#x27;t used it yet but very pleased!</li>
    <li> Product was as described. Made a neat presentation with extra outlets.</li>
    <li> This transformed my daughter&#x27;s bathroom from a corded mess to an organized hair station.  Before this organizer my daughter&#x27;s 4 electric hair gadgets had one plug available, were all over the counters,  and cords everywhere.  Now they are all sitting in this nice unit and there&#x27;s one plug to the wall and 3 of the 4 are plugged into the unit and stored nicely.  Its not made for attractiveness only in black but the metal is durable and its the function that really counts.  I&#x27;m not sure if the plastic receptacles are heat proof so I&#x27;ve told her to make sure things are cool before returning them to the slots.  The only negative comment I have is that the smallest circular receptacle doesn&#x27;t&#x27; fit any of her plug in hair irons but she just used one of the side slots instead.  She puts brushes or gadgets handle side down in the unused portions so its all still very useful.  Very happy with this.  I&#x27;ve seen others but this one has the electrical outlets on it and that&#x27;s one of the best features, wouldn&#x27;t buy it without this.</li>
    <li> The item was smaller then what I expected.  Also, the way the outlets are I have a hard time plugging more than 1 item in.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for the powder room</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s well constructed but the holds didn&#x27;t fit any of my devices.  I needed three of the large holes for my hair dryer and my rolling styler and rolling brush.  I was hoping at least one of them would fit in the side compartment but it didn&#x27;t.  If you have lots of small devices, definitely a value for the money.  Just not for me.</li>
