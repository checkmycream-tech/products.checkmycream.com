      <li>Maybe you&#x27;ll have a better experience, or maybe you&#x27;ll get a defective one like me.</li>
      <li>I found nothing good about this cheap and cheaply made trimmer.</li>
      <li>Better quality checks suggested.</li>
      <li>so I was okay with that</li>
      <li>and I am looking for something better.</li>
      <li>It does somewhat of the job, but you can get something much better for just a bit more.</li>
      <li>This thing seems to work, which is better than one can expect I suppose.    </li>
      <li>I have to whack it against the counter top to get it to run</li>
      <li>Love this thing.  </li>
      <li>This time I&#x27;ll shop for something in the $20 dollar range. :)</li>
      <li>It had a wider head and stuck out more.  </li>
      <li>ok for travel</li>

      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>so it is easy to keep working.</li>
      <li>I had the previous model of the Remington battery operated trimmer and it was great!  </li>
      <li>Ist works fine, but the battery life ends quickly!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut close as the skin is, and I have to use it more frequently, but waxing and threading really irritate my face with bumps for almost a week!!!!!</li>
      <li>This is a cheap model.</li>
      <li>I use it for my facial hair, and it works great</li>
      <li>I use it for my mustache primarily but it works well for the nose &amp; ears.</li>
      <li>Also, it feels a bit on the cheap side.</li>
      <li>Cheap and practical.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cheap product.</li>
      <li>Bottom line is: While they last they are really great</li>
      <li>just do not use old battery&#x27;s it is not as good.</li>
      <li>I have bought just about every detailer/trimmer/nose hair clipper in the free world over the last ten years, but this is EASILY THE BEST I HAVE EVER FOUND!</li>
      <li>Plus, forget getting a clean trim line on your sideburns (or wherever you&#x27;re grooming) with this.  </li>
      <li>I liked it better than a larger Remington I had before.</li>
      <li>does the job, keeps things clean.  </li>
      <li>I need to return it for a full refund</li>

      <li>Battery life is good but doesn&#x27;t trim well enough for 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Quiet and good for close cut.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>wish it would cut closer but not bad.  </li>
      <li>It runs on 2 AAA batteries so it runs through those fairly quickly</li>
      <li>I bought this at a local TJ Maxx store for the same price (plus sales tax, so Amazon&#x27;s cheaper) and am very happy with the purchase.  </li>
      <li>I had read reviews that it wears batteries out quickly.  </li>
      <li>good and good for fine trimming, but useless because&lt;</li>
      <li>I really prefer them for the simple reason that their small size makes them very agile - perfect for trimming a beard and mustache.</li>
      <li>This little shaver is great</li>
      <li>I used the trimmer for a couple months without the guard and was pleased with it for some edging, but now the trimmer is completely fried and doesn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
      <li>, there is not enough power to cut and trim effectively.</li>
      <li>I TURNED IT ON AFTER PUTTING IN FRESH BATTERIES</li>
      <li>I bought this at a Marshall&#x27;s for like $12, but right after I bought it</li>
      <li>Right out of the box, the guard for the bear trimmer cracked, making that unusable.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve tried several different battery changes and battery types but he has not been able to use it as he would have liked as it is not reliable.</li>
      <li>Simple, basic works great</li>
      <li>It cuts pretty close but not to the point where you can no longer see or feel your hair.</li>
      <li>First use it kept dying and restarting.</li>
      <li>After many years it finally died.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, it pulled and tugged and did not trim.  </li>
      <li>I bought this one to replace it, it broke the first time I took it off.</li>
      <li>Im still on the first batteries.  </li>
      <li>it works, it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>I most definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND it.  </li>
      <li>Good for short term use, but it you expect it to last a couple months don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
      <li>This is the same razor but has replaceable batteries and the attachments from the old groomer fit and function just fine.  </li>
      <li>The razor is sharp and works great for detailing, touchups, and when you miss a spot after your regular shaving.  </li>
      <li>t expect to cut too good on one small batery&lt;</li>
      <li>The blade on this trimmer is too small for good trimming.</li>
      <li>Some accesories doesnt Work but in general is Very useful</li>
      <li>Some groomers have bigger blades so they can cut you, but this one&#x27;s blades are really fine, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about cuts.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this at a local TJ Maxx store for the same price (plus sales tax, so Amazon&#x27;s cheaper) and am very happy with the purchase.  I had purchased a Conair blade trimmer which was basically junk and fell apart everytime you used it.... this is a sturdy unit and the various attachments make it well-suited for basic grooming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> perfect for edging along the bottom of moustache</li>
    <li> Does everything as claimed. I use it for my mustache primarily but it works well for the nose &amp; ears. It even works well to trim the back of my hair.</li>
    <li> This little groomer does a great job on small projects - eyebrows, ears, etc. Don&#x27;t expect to give yourself a full haircut with it, but it&#x27;s great for trimming and tidying. It runs on 2 AAA batteries so it runs through those fairly quickly but, remember, this is just a trimmer. It comes with a comb-like device that clips over the blades so you can control the length of the cut should that need arise (but why would you do that?). It also has a clip-on shield to protect the blades when not in use and a little draw-string bag. Nice li&#x27;l clipper at an unbeatable price!</li>
    <li> Cheap and practical. Convenient for travel. Small size. A very good purchase! I liked it better than a larger Remington I had before.</li>
    <li> Best bang for the Buck! As to the batteries others are reporting it&#x27;s as the saying goes, \\&quot;With batteries, you get what you pay for.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> lightweight and comfortable--works as expected</li>
    <li> I ordered three numbers and one of them is not working. Better quality checks suggested. And other two are working fine</li>
    <li> I bought this at a Marshall&#x27;s for like $12, but right after I bought it I found something five times as nicer for only $20. Go for something else!!! This is a cheap model. It does somewhat of the job, but you can get something much better for just a bit more.</li>
    <li> It does not provide very close shave that I can get with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Of course there is always a risk of cuts with razors so I opted to try this product.  It is a compromise for safety.</li>
    <li> Great electric razor! I use this everyday. I have sensitive skin so i can&#x27;t use a straight razor on my face or I will get razor bumps. This AAA battery operated model works great on me, I use it every day!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver actually to keep my cat well groomed.  She has very thick hair and even though I brush her daily, she occasionally needs some trimming.  This little item performs exactly as I hoped it would and is quiet enough that it does not frighten her.  As well as it works on my cat, I would think it would work just as well on humans.</li>
    <li> This thing seems to work, which is better than one can expect I suppose.    Note that it WILL NOT run using re-chargeable batteries, not even a groan, so that&#x27;s probably why others have noted the short regular battery life as well.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very good for the price.  The razor is sharp and works great for detailing, touchups, and when you miss a spot after your regular shaving.  The only issue I have with it is putting in the batteries and securing the bottom.  The batteries don&#x27;t stay in easily after being put in and the battery cover is difficult to secure on.</li>
    <li> I must have got a bad one because mine doesn&#x27;t work at all. That&#x27;s $10 down the drain. Maybe you&#x27;ll have a better experience, or maybe you&#x27;ll get a defective one like me.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for what I wanted it for.  Used to trim the hairs above my upper lip and other areas of my goatee.  Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say how long a battery will last, but not worried.  I&#x27;d recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up review 3-22-2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting to slow down despite new batteries.  Sometimes won&#x27;t start.  Turns out this is a poorly engineered device not worthy of another purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered a Remington Pg165 Battery Operated Travel Personal Groomer for my husband as one of his Christmas presents. I had given him a similar one roughly eight years ago(it was a different brand name) and he loved it&#x27;s size, simplicity, convenience and ease of storage and travel. An additional bonus was not having to deal with long,entangled cords by having it battery operated. Anyway I ordered it but it wasn&#x27;t opened until a couple of days after this past Christmas 2011. Much to his disappointment and my embarrassment; the switch to turn it off and on is defective. Once you get it to run it doesn&#x27;t stay running. We&#x27;ve tried several different battery changes and battery types but he has not been able to use it as he would have liked as it is not reliable. I need to return it for a full refund please.</li>
    <li> what you would expect. does the job, keeps things clean.  wish it would cut closer but not bad.  sometimes i have to hit it to work but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> No complaints... the trimmer and accessories work as described and are a valuable addition to any grooming kit. I use it every day and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> It does a good job when it works.  One day it didn&#x27;t start, so I thought it was out of battery.  So I put a new set of batteries in and it still would not start.  I was surprise to see that it failed after just 8 months of use. You get what you pay for, so a $10 trimmer will not last you long.  This time I&#x27;ll shop for something in the $20 dollar range. :)</li>
    <li> Bought this mainly to cut my nose hair, but can be used for different purposes also. I do use it to touch up my hairline occasionally.</li>
    <li> works very well&lt;br /&gt;batteries last a long time for me&lt;br /&gt;sometimes I have to whack it against the counter top to get it to run</li>
    <li> Simple, basic works great I am very happy with it.  I had one of these for several years and the plastic cover broke so I ordered the newer model.  It is great</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. It is very weak. Even when I replaced the battery, it&#x27;s still weak. (We bought it based on the Remington company name. Oops.)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut well. Not worth purchasing. I would suggest you do not buy this product. Waste of hard earned money.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a personal trimmer for the bikini line.  I thought the small head and single line of the blades would be good for cleaning up the bikini area.  The first time I used it, it pulled and tugged and did not trim.  Since it failed down below, I&#x27;ve put it in my boyfriends trimmer basket and use it to clean up his neck :)</li>
    <li> These well made products are just what I was looking for. This is well made and arrived in short order. Thank You!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for trimming the boys, but there needs to be a shorter guard length. You cannot use this shaver without a guard when working in delicate areas, or else you may nick yourself. This wasn&#x27;t a problem with the older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One AAA battery seems to last for awhile. Not sure why it says you need two?</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for $10. It doesn&#x27;t cut close as the skin is, and I have to use it more frequently, but waxing and threading really irritate my face with bumps for almost a week!!!!! This is a great option for sensitive skin. I doubt it would go too far in the bikini line, but I only have used the tiny attachment for like nose hair, on my face.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer for the money. Easy to use and it is cordless. If I was trimming a beard I would probably choose different trimmer. I use it to trim side burns only.</li>
    <li> Good product, and great size also.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer. It does a really nice job of cutting my thick hair. The only complaint I have about this is that the part that adjusts the cutting length does not stay on the trimmer and falls off all the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a previous Remington I had, which was worked very well for a long time.  I figured the power with this new power would be comparable, given both operated from a single AA battery.  No suck luck.  Plus, forget getting a clean trim line on your sideburns (or wherever you&#x27;re grooming) with this.  This is a very disappointing product.</li>
    <li> The blade on this trimmer is too small for good trimming. It&#x27;s also totally not powerful. I also had a hard time getting the battery door to open. I found nothing good about this cheap and cheaply made trimmer.</li>
    <li> got it to trim my little dogs hair/fur around her eyes, wouldn&#x27;t cut it. It was a waste of my money</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this one. Cheap construction, very weak motor.</li>
    <li> Perfect for men or women&#x27;s grooming and great size for traveling.</li>
    <li> The product power is low and doesn&#x27;t work for bikini area. The blade trimmer is really short and not sharp. Would not recommend for others to purchase.</li>
    <li> It took going through 6 brands/types of batteries before I found one that works. Rechargeable batteries don&#x27;t work, which is common with some items, but even new Energizer, Duracell and CVS batteries wouldn&#x27;t work. What finally worked for me were Rayovac batteries from the 99-cent store, but even with those I need to keep opening/closing the battery compartment to get it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it works, it works pretty well. Not very strong, but it cuts cleanly and is pretty comfortable, even around sensitive parts, like ear lobes.</li>
    <li> It arrived soon and in perfect condition to the house. Battery life is good but doesn&#x27;t trim well enough for 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband to trim his mustache.  He loves the small tip for getting detailed closeness.  And it is a compact size, great for travel!</li>
    <li> I bought this during a sale for a daily steal on another site, but it has been a pain since I got it a few weeks ago. The batteries do wear out fast and it worked briefly with rechargeable batteries , but now it wont even start with regular batteries inside. I have spent enough time to try to find proper batteries or to get this to work, that it is going in the trash and I am looking for something better.</li>
    <li> First use it kept dying and restarting. Hair was not even long, trimmed it as close as I could with scissors, but just plain cheap product. Would not recommend to any one ... I would give it a zero star if I had the option. Won&#x27;t even bother returning it..</li>
    <li> I had the rechargeable version of this groomer and the batteries didn&#x27;t hold up after a year. This is the same razor but has replaceable batteries and the attachments from the old groomer fit and function just fine.  It stores into the same recharge holder that the old one did.</li>
    <li> This has worked much better for me than more expensive ones and I wanted a battery operated device so I don&#x27;t have yet another charger sitting around. This is the second of these that I have bought the past few years.</li>
    <li> Not sharp.  Don&#x27;t really use.</li>
    <li> Horrible. I threw it away. It pulled and yanked. I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three versions of this battery-powered trimmer, including a rechargeable model and a previous version with replaceable batteries. They all appear to be identical in shape, controls, etc. I really prefer them for the simple reason that their small size makes them very agile - perfect for trimming a beard and mustache. I&#x27;ve never gotten the hang of larger and more powerful trimmers that just don&#x27;t seem to fit on your upper lip or in facial contours. The rechargeable model gave up the ghost a while back and I won&#x27;t replace it.  I have come to appreciate the replaceable batteries.They last for a very long time and you can leave this in a travel kit for months and pull it out on the road and it immediately works, where the rechargeable battery would have long since drained, forcing you to carry the charger as well and plug it in for a good while before it&#x27;s usable. That being said, the clip-on shoes or guides break very easily at the attachment point and I wind up holding them on with my hand. I just purchased this one to have an extra for travel and was disappointed to find that the trimmer motor runs noticeably slower on the new version which really reduces the cutting action. The results are the same but the process is disappointing. Maybe I got a defective unit, but I&#x27;m inclined to think the unit is just inferior to the same model made 4 or 5 years ago. If I knew of another unit of similar size that ran on replaceable batteries, I&#x27;d buy it. Until then, this is functional.</li>
    <li> Terrible, horrible. Remington replaced the rechargeable version&lt;br /&gt;with this POS that eats batteries, and WILL NOT run on 1.2v&lt;br /&gt;rechargeable NiCad or NiMH AAA batteries.  The stock head&lt;br /&gt;is good and good for fine trimming, but useless because&lt;br /&gt;of its power requirement.  Even with expensive non rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;AAA, there is not enough power to cut and trim effectively.</li>
    <li> I stick to this model because it doesn&#x27;t cut the skin at all even when you accidentally rub it against your skin.  Some groomers have bigger blades so they can cut you, but this one&#x27;s blades are really fine, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about cuts.</li>
    <li> Works well but battery dies after 1-2 weeks. The blades are not cheap blades, they are super strong blades. Nice traveling pouch, and easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box, the guard for the bear trimmer cracked, making that unusable. I used the trimmer for a couple months without the guard and was pleased with it for some edging, but now the trimmer is completely fried and doesn&#x27;t even turn on. Unfortunate.</li>
    <li> I had the previous model of the Remington battery operated trimmer and it was great!  It had a wider head and stuck out more.  I used it for family hair trimming of eyebrows and neck hair. After many years it finally died. This model that replaces it is a joke.  It kind if beats at the hair, but doesn&#x27;t cut well at all. I most definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND it.  I would not even have given it one star if I could have had the choice.</li>
    <li> trimmer is powerful enough to do the job i bought it for,portable without having to plug it in electrical outlet.</li>
    <li> . i owned a rechargeable one that was also a remington which lasted for 8 yrs. i was hoping i&#x27;d get the same quality as the last one but did&#x27;nt . it does&#x27;nt seem to have any power .look for a differant product and bypass this one .</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve purchased trimmers (primarily for nose &amp; ear hair--I know it sounds gross, but if only the hair on my head grew as fast).  None have been any good--including one that sort of looked like this one.  I tried the manually operated kind that you find in stores like Brookstones.  A lot of manual action, but little results. I only took a flyer on this one because it was recommended by the MenInBlazers.com website.  Bottom line: it&#x27;s great.  It actually works and works efficiently.  I had been using scissors and a magnifying mirror for the job with OK results (as well as a few cuts here and there).  It&#x27;s no contest with this trimmer. I won&#x27;t be using the two attachments that come with the device for beards, mustaches and whatever.  At this price, it&#x27;s a steal.  And the fabric bag that comes with it stores everything.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is good while it lasts. I knew this about it when I bought it so I was okay with that but if you are looking for a long term product this clipper will only last about three or four months and you should know that. The gaurd that has to be removed to clean these is very fragile and my lasy one finaly broke. I bought this one to replace it, it broke the first time I took it off. I repaired it but you should know what you are getting into with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for three stars instead of two or one though is because they cut very well. You can get hard to reach places and small delicate areas very close to the skin and they don&#x27;t pinch or grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom line is: While they last they are really great but they only last for a short time and are dedlicate.</li>
    <li> Nice product, allows me to trim my beard without any problem. The only thing is that the batteries don&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Requires 1 AA Battery and uses them rapidly.  Don&#x27;t even think about trying to use dollar store batteries on this - No Way.  Other than that it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> for the money u pay on it is ok&lt;br /&gt;don t expect to cut too good on one small batery&lt;br /&gt;is ok for travel and that s all</li>
    <li> Does a very good job. I just needed something small for occasional use. It fills the bill. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works just fine, not amazing but no issues after 1 year. So cheap ($) that I expected worse, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s lasting performance.</li>
    <li> Love this thing.  I had read reviews that it wears batteries out quickly.  Im still on the first batteries.  Seems to go and go.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for cutting hair and trimming.  Hate to cut without it!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It works very well and I would recomend it for it&#x27;s intended use.</li>
    <li> what can i say ...don&#x27;t know how it works...because IT DOESN&#x27;T !! It looks VERY cheaply made...the on off button is VERY flimsy ....i don&#x27;t not recommend you wast EVEN $10 on this !!</li>
    <li> I TURNED IT ON AFTER PUTTING IN FRESH BATTERIES 5 MINUTES LATER IT DIED! WASTE OF MONEY I FEEL CHEATED!!</li>
    <li> Terrible, broke right away. It fell apart and does not work. It&#x27;s a cheap product. Do not buy this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my old one disappeared. This is not the same model as my old one and this one did not hold up as long nor did it trim as well. It broke after a couple of uses. I will be looking for a different brand/model in the future to replace this one with.</li>
    <li> It appeared heavy duty and sturdy when I was shopping for a trimmer to replace the cheap one I had had for several years. But in fact is not dependable at all. I believe there is a problem with the switch. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Replacing the battery made no difference. Is difficult to use since it has to be held in an uncomfortable position when trimming neck, sideburns and etc. in the process of finishing up a hair cut. I don&#x27;t have the paper work and etc. so can&#x27;t send it back or else I would definitely return the thing.</li>
    <li> Does the job but doesn&#x27;t have enough power with an Eneloop rechargeable battery.  Also, it feels a bit on the cheap side.</li>
    <li> While it worked, it was excellent - a close trim with no pulling.  Unfortunately, it stopped working within a few months.</li>
    <li> finally a good trimmer. it uses a AA battery so it is easy to keep working.</li>
    <li> My husband broke his last shaver and this is just the right size for him.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;VERY POOR QUALITY CONSTRUCTION.&lt;br /&gt;WORKED FOR ONLY A FEW MONTHS EVEN THOUGH IT WAS USED INFREQUENTLY.&lt;br /&gt;TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO TRY TO RETURN.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S GOING IN THE GARBAGE WHERE IT BELONGS.!</li>
    <li> Honestly I only use this to trim my eyebrows.  I put in batteries a year ago and they are still operational.  There is sufficient power even though this is battery operated to not get bogged down.  I don&#x27;t know if it would work on dog hair but on human hair it has plenty of power.</li>
    <li> This thing is ok but not great. It cuts pretty close but not to the point where you can no longer see or feel your hair. Another con is it will stop working at times then cut back on. Good for short term use, but it you expect it to last a couple months don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this unit works.  It trims my mustache extremely well.</li>
    <li> Some accesories doesnt Work but in general is Very useful</li>
    <li> This little shaver is great I use it for my facial hair, and it works great just do not use old battery&#x27;s it is not as good.</li>
    <li> Was wanting the razor in the package but received the one in the stand alone picture. I&#x27;m sure it will work just fine but pictures should match.</li>
    <li> Quiet and good for close cut.&lt;br /&gt;Note a small head means it is not good for thick growth or large area.</li>
    <li> This does not work well on facial hair. It gets caught alot, even on short hair. Def will not recommend.</li>
    <li> Ist works fine, but the battery life ends quickly! ist a great trimmer for me works perfectly for detail on my face!</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work, simple as that. Very disappointed in Remington.</li>
    <li> I have bought just about every detailer/trimmer/nose hair clipper in the free world over the last ten years, but this is EASILY THE BEST I HAVE EVER FOUND! Feels solid in your hand! Tbe only caveat is that if you are only trimming beards and mustaches for length, this wont work, you need something more heavy duty with more trimmer head length options. But for around the beard, ear and nose hair, eyebrows, and other assorted body hair, you wont be disaplointed</li>
    <li> Husband does not really like it. I pulls hair.</li>
    <li> Purchsed this item as replacement for similar item by Remington. Have not had to unpack as yet, however Remington, for me, has the best construction and versatility of any trimmers available. I have a moustace and beard which I keep short and trim weekly. I need one appliance that will trim my beard, any stray eyebrow hairs and also trim my moustache above my upper lip. This one does it quite well. And, of course, at Amazon, the price was by far the best.</li>
    <li> Since this is a gift, it looks great to me. I&#x27;d have to ask my brother once he had a chance to use it.</li>
