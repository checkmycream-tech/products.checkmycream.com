<li> I apply a little bit on towel dried hair and the style it the way I want it.</li>
<li> My hair is stronger and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky.  </li>

    <li> Another great, great product from Living Proof. I find it works better when applied to my hair after I&#x27;ve dried it with a blow dryer as opposed to applying it on damp hair prior to blow drying.</li>
    <li> I have to use quite a bit more product than it recommends to get the desired result</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! Thats all I can say. Its great and smells good too!</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product for my hair. I replaced a leave-in conditioner and balm with this one product. I can let my hair air dry now without it looking a frizzy mess after a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great to tame my wavy, unruly hair. I apply a little bit on towel dried hair and the style it the way I want it. I got it as a free sample and really loved it.</li>
    <li> I have red hair that I dye about every 5 weeks, heat style, etc. this product actually transformed my dry frizzy hair to soft manageable hair I haven&#x27;t had since I was an early teen. Using this for life. It&#x27;s is expensive, but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I had received a sample of this instant repair and loved it.  This is an excellent product and from this seller, an excellent price.  I would definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product at a fantastic price. Sephora charges double for the very same thing! Everyone will love it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I had a sample first. Makes my hair look so good.</li>
    <li> I am a blonde with highlights and this helps soften my hair for when blowing it dry straight. Really easy to use and lasts awhile (I only use it on my ends.) Huge fan of all Living Proof products but this is one of my favorites - really great smelling too!</li>
    <li> I love this product. However, when I bought it I thought it was a rinse-out type of condition. It is a LEAVE IN conditioner. It untangles well too.</li>
    <li> My hair is damaged and this product helps it to looks healthy</li>
    <li> Makes hair shiny &amp; soft without weighing it down</li>
    <li> Makes a huge difference in my hair. I use it almost daily. No build up. Light weight. Smells great.</li>
    <li> An amazing product! This thing works. I didn&#x27;t think anything was possible with my dry curly hair. But a little goes a long way. I would give it 10 starts if I could. Just great!!!</li>
    <li> A great product . I think it works very well with thin hair does not weigh the hair down . I have only used it a short while but hoping it will help to repair my damage hair from all the chemicals.</li>
    <li> Just ok! Nothing like the mask from this line of product!</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel and I feel like it would work if I used it more</li>
    <li> I use this daily, along with the Restore shampoo &amp; conditioner, and also bought the Restore Mask Treatment, which I use once a week.  Maybe using the entire product line at once has been the key to this success.  I apply this (takes about four pumps to do my medium length hair) on wet hair before using any other styling products.  If I flat iron my hair a little pump of this applied to a fried strand of hair will smooth it and not look greasy.  I&#x27;ve seen a significant difference in my hair&#x27;s texture, softness and sheen. I&#x27;ve also noticed less breakage and I flat iron my hair almost every day.  I just ordered the Restore Instant Protection spray so I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;ll improve things even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought all of these Living Proof Restore products here on Amazon and they arrived quickly, within a day of one another so I was able to get started right away.  Plus, it was cheaper on Amazon rather than directly from the company.  The packaging was done with care so nothing leaked out.  Overall, thumbs up all around.  I am a lifetime fan of this line and plan to be a loyal user.  It&#x27;s helped my hair better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! It&#x27;s a very good leave-in conditioner.  I&#x27;ve used other Living Proof products, and haven&#x27;t liked many of them (other than Straight). This one is a staple.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. The more I use it the better it works. A very small amount goes a long way. Really has made a difference in my over processed hair.</li>
    <li> I use more than the package recommends to make my fine hair fuller and thicker.  My hair is stronger and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky.  Living Proof is a good name for this product.</li>
