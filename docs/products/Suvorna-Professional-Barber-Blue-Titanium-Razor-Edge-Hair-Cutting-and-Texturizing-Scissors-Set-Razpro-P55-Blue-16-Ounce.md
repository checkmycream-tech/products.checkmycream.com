      <li>really bad.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>

      <li>light and sharp.</li>
      <li>These scissors are sharp and comfortable to use.  </li>
      <li>In comparing different scissors, I found there were two general categories: the dirt-cheap ones (anywhere from 5 to 20 dollars) and the high-quality, professional kind (upwards of $100 and sometimes even up to $150 for a SINGLE PAIR.)  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend to the professional.</li>
      <li>The thinners work really well enough</li>
      <li>I am a professional stylist, and bought these shears to use at home</li>
      <li>The regular shears work lovely but the thinning shears had all types of knicks along the blade and it SHREDS my hair and pulls so harshly if I use them.</li>
      <li>and they feel just as sharp as the first time she used them on me.  </li>
      <li>that I purchases a separate pair for myself when I just need to thin out my top.  </li>
      <li>(And according to other reviews, even professional hairstylists call this set high quality.  </li>
      <li>and since I&#x27;ve been wearing the same style for decades, I can do a  fair job of cutting it myself.</li>

    <li> I purchased these over a year ago and I am still in love with them.  The scissors, shears and the case are all HIGH QUALITY and are all WORTH THE PRICE.  I purchased this set to use at home becuase I like to put my hairs fate into my own hands and these worked great for me.  The shears are nice for when you want to trim or layer the hair a little without taking too much off.  I Recomend this product to Beginners and Professionals : )</li>
    <li> These were purchased for home use.  All of the haircuts in my family are done within the family—it&#x27;s been years since anyone bought a haircut.  In comparing different scissors, I found there were two general categories: the dirt-cheap ones (anywhere from 5 to 20 dollars) and the high-quality, professional kind (upwards of $100 and sometimes even up to $150 for a SINGLE PAIR.)  I went to a beauty salon supply store also to verify these were the actual sorts of prices.  There I found moderately nice scissors (no titanium edge) for $20-$50, no case, just one pair of scissors.  The high end ones were $80 to $130, some with a case, some without.  There were also some sets of thinning AND cutting scissors, for roughly the same price as this set or a bit cheaper, but much lower quality and definitely no cheaper sets that came with a case or that looked comparable in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find anything that could compare to this set both in quality and in price.  So we went ahead and got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve done 2 or 3 haircuts since then and both pairs of scissors are very functional, very nicely designed and a pleasure to use.  They are sharp, cut well and are easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is quite nice and protects the scissors well; it is a classy dark gray and snaps shut with a concealed magnet clasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this set is a good investment if you&#x27;re looking to do haircutting at home.  I plan to still be using mine in 20 years.  (And according to other reviews, even professional hairstylists call this set high quality.  I believe it.)</li>
    <li> The Shear set was in awesome condition and work amazing now the case it comes with was broken doesnt hold my shears so my overall review is bad i will never buy from here again</li>
    <li> I am finishing beauty school and have used them in real clients and love the shape and color....not to mention they cut very well......I recommended to anybody looking to get inexpensive yet good shears....</li>
    <li> I have been trying to grow my hair out and every time I go to get it cut, the stylist leaves split ends.  These scissors are sharp and comfortable to use.  There is a great instructional guide as well.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are not for professional use; the blades are too thick and the tong kept falling off the scissor.  So disappointed!</li>
    <li> I am a professional stylist, and bought these shears to use at home so I don&#x27;t have to keep bringing my work shears home with me. When I saw all the good reviews, I figured \\&quot;what the hay, why not?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was quick, and was delivered on time. When I opened the box, I noticed there were dents and scratch marks all over the case. When I opened the case and looked at the shears, I noticed MANY inconsistencies. First, there was a nick in the blade of the cutting shears. Secondly, the metal was scratched up in a few places, and was missing is coating in 1 or 2 places as well.&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto how they cut. Absolutely terrible. They were DULL! While cutting my dad&#x27;s hair, I noticed the cutting shears cut like I was using kindergarten scissors. It was loud, and has the same sound as if I were dry cutting with a razor. It definitely did not have that butter feel. And when using the thinning shears to blend his sides, he kept saying \\&quot;ow, that&#x27;s pulling my hair really bad.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, the $80.00 I spent on this set was a waste of money. There is no way I will ever use these again, not even to cut paper. These crappy \\&quot;scissors\\&quot; are going back!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter who is a cosmotologist. I asked her if she was pleased with them and she said that she is.</li>
    <li> I m a fan of KIll Bill and I could def cut my way through and army of crazy 88&#x27;s hair cuts with these shears.  They look great and are razor sharp and make cutting hair very quick and easy even for an experienced stylist.  I love these scissors.</li>
    <li> The regular shears work lovely but the thinning shears had all types of knicks along the blade and it SHREDS my hair and pulls so harshly if I use them. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchase these as a gift for a friend who was an upcoming stylist.  She love them, and her customers are quite satisfied with the results.  I&#x27;ve had her cut my hair a few times over the years and they feel just as sharp as the first time she used them on me.  The thinners work really well enough that I purchases a separate pair for myself when I just need to thin out my top.  The design is comfortable to handle and the quality thus far have held up quite well.</li>
    <li> between these easy-to-use pro scissors &amp; my oster clipper I&#x27;m now doing my own short, funky haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the thinning shears, especially, is a great tool for blending &amp; texturizing. (just remember not to close the jaws all the way when using the shears.)</li>
    <li> Great scissors for my grandaughter who is in cosmetology school. She is thrilled with their quality and the fact that they are less expensive than most hair cutting scissors.</li>
    <li> My son is just starting to cut hair and I bought these for him as a beginning set.  The blue inserts come out to make the holes bigger if needed, so it was great for him.</li>
    <li> is sharp and I cut my finger</li>
    <li> Scissors are awesome. I bought $299 scissors and they don&#x27;t compare to these! Well worth the money!!! Highly recommend to the professional.</li>
    <li> My daughter who works in a salon asked for new cutting sheers for Christmas.  She gave me some qualities to look for and I bought these.  She loves them!</li>
    <li> Definitely should have bought it long time ago.  My wife just gave me the best haircut ever, and it a shorter time.  Very comfortable grip and cuts very well.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful. Even better than the $2000 Shears we got at Hairschool from Aveda (I&#x27;ll graduate next month). I don&#x27;t know why but they glide along the hair so much better. All the girls at school like these better, though we are required to cut with the ones we purchased from school, when I give haircuts at home ( I give a lot of haircuts), I always use these. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> great scissors and thinning shears</li>
    <li> The scissors are good. light and sharp. I never cut my hair by myself before. I tried the first time when I received them. It turned out to be not bad. With this scissor, I think I can say goodbye to barbers....</li>
    <li> I hate going to a salon to get my hair cut and since I&#x27;ve been wearing the same style for decades, I can do a  fair job of cutting it myself. I&#x27;d been using salon scissors I purchased decades ago. Could not believe the difference in feel, and sharpness of these scissors. I&#x27;m very glad I got them since it doesn&#x27;t seem that I&#x27;ll be changing my habit of cutting my own hair (really it doesn&#x27;t look that bad) anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I really like these and found them worth every dollar compared to the rest. They were very high quality and came in a cool box with a magnetic lid. And everyone loves magnets. :]</li>
    <li> My wife loves them and she gets many compliments on them.. She says they do a great job! Came very quickly and packaged nicely!! A+ seller.</li>
    <li> Great for butchers! Quality, if one is skilled.</li>
