<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair but once it gets longer than an inch it falls flat. I really like this shampoo and conditioner duo because it fluffs up my flat lifeless hair into a thick vibrant masterpiece! I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s male line in the past and was unimpressed. This stuff is great and at this price it&#x27;s such a bargain I feel like I stole it.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product.  It had a weird smell to it and left my hair feeling greasy</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Used both shampoo and conditioner but they left my hair feeling dry and tangled. will not use again</li>
    <li> Light scented and leaves my hair very soft. I was tempted to over-use it as it does not foam up. Makes my hair look thicker.</li>
    <li> this product is really good, and definitely worth its price. My hair gets more smooth with the product and more shinning!</li>
    <li> Shampoo is a bit &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; but smells good and gives hair volume</li>
    <li> Great smelling shampoo and conditioner and I noticed a significant difference to the smoothness of my hair when I used both. I really liked the fact that this did not have any sulfate inside of it. With that said, though, I sometimes used maybe more shampoo than necessary (the lack of visible suds threw me off a bit and sometimes I added more thinking I&#x27;d need it!). Overall, I loved the gentleness of the shampoo and it smelled AMAZING - like candy! I loved it! I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I like this product because  it is suflate free. I dont like to apply the chemical product on my hair since it will create the damage in the long term. the result is good and clean. Feel peace to use this product.</li>
    <li> I receive it as product tester, and I tried today. Helps my hair smooth a little, I have fizzy problem. I will update later as I use longer</li>
    <li> This product was very good and made my hair smell great and made it feel wonderful</li>
    <li> I love the brand Triple Thread! As usual they did not disappoint! I love how my hair feels afterwards and how it smells. I really recommend to anyone! plus is sulfate free!!</li>
    <li> For many years I have struggled with very thin fine hair and try every morning to set my hair just right so not a lot of scalp showing. I have tried a ton of very expensive products to help the issue and get my confidence back. I tried this volume shampoo and conditioner and felt immediately a fullness to my hair. I feel like I have gained a lot of feel good attitude back with using this product and will be purchasing again and again. I also love that the product is sulfate and paraben free. Only con is I wish it was bigger bottles so I don&#x27;t have to order often.</li>
    <li> Shampoo didn&#x27;t have much of a smell and was difficult to lather through hair.  Shampoo did not leave my hair feeling clean and was still oily after shower and had to use a dry shampoo with the product.  I have used the product for about 2 weeks but am not noticing an improvement and have switched back to my usual shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair, and have been looking for a product to help with volume. I always use hair products that are sulfate and parable free, and this fit that requirememt. I like the fragrance, and noticed increased volume after one use. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Product purchased with promotional discount, it wasn&#x27;t extreme, but it gave me a good price so I could try the product in order to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is runny and it took a lot to get sufficient suds to wash my waist length hair.  It did clean well though, and it smells good.  It&#x27;s orange.  By itself I&#x27;d probably give the shampoo a 3.  It cleans ok, and it has formula consistent with its claims, but it is just ok.  This one works, it&#x27;s a good clarifier, but I didn&#x27;t find it all that impressive or special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner though - it is great- a total *5*.  It&#x27;s thick, and a lot goes a long way.  It is the real star of this product combination. It is really nice for detangling long hair while wet, and I think they should sell it by itself.  It has wheat germ in it and is highly fragrant.  I love the fragrance. It&#x27;s smells just a bit like an oriental vanilla, with some amber base and a touch of musk, and a light floral top note that isn&#x27;t too sweet.  It&#x27;s actually a hard scent for me to place, or describe, but that&#x27;s my best shot.  It is a warm, delicious fragrance that lingers after hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave my hair extremely soft, with lots of body and very shiny.  I would not say it is the most volumizing set ever, but it performs fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is easy to use, a bit plain and it is rather hard to read the instructions.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how long to leave the conditioner on, so I left it on for 5 minutes.  I did not find that it dried my scalp out at all, personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large size is the best deal I think, and I&#x27;d buy the conditioner again, but I prefer other shampoos.</li>
    <li> Adds volume. Fun packaging, didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size. They&#x27;re only 8oz bottles.</li>
    <li> My hair is usually fairly flat, but this shampoo has given it more life and volume. Very happy with the results, and I would also love to try their smoothing shampoo!</li>
    <li> Triple Thread paraben free and sulfate free shampoo and conditioner has truly transformed my hair. Let&#x27;s face it, no one wants flat, dull, lifeless hair, and it is so hard to find the right combination for your hair. Triple Thread has found the perfect solution to fixing your lifeless hair. My hair has so much volume now unlike before. This product is made with the best quality ingredients that can be found for hair care. I love using products that are healthy, natural, and nourishes. Because of its rich ingredients, it is great for hair that is thinning and oily. I suffer from oily hair, and I can honestly say that this product has changed that. I used to wash my hair everyday, and now I am able to wash it every other day. Although it does not mention this as one of the benefits, I found that my hair is much smoother and no longer frizzy. I have only cut my hair once in my lifetime about 4 years ago so you can imagine just how frizzy my hair can be. This item has really helped my hair. I find that it is because of all the natural ingredients, and the fact that it does not contain any harsh chemicals. In addition to all of it&#x27;s great healthy benefits, it smells amazing! It will truly leave your hair smelling amazing until you wash it. My husband has even been complimenting me on how good my hair smells!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo and conditioner which I got at a reduced price to facilitate a review. First off let me start by saying I prefer natural products that do not contain all those harmful ingredients! I do color my hair and so I stay away from sulfates. I also have very thin hair and I am getting into my 40&#x27;s so my hair is thinning.&lt;br /&gt;I found this shampoo and conditioner to be excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is nice. Summery for sure. Not as intense as suntan oil or lotion, but close enough. I like the light scent and you can even slightly smell the vitamins in it.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does lather up but probably not as much as most people are used to. The stuff in shampoo that makes it suds up is the stuff that is not good for your hair and actually does nothing for your hair. Its just something our society has got used to.&lt;br /&gt;Either way the conditioner is dreamy, rich, and makes your hair feel so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I found my hair when dry to be somewhat fuller however the real results are when I styled it, I found that the styling made it fuller than usual.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this brand of shampoo and conditioner before but really wanted to give it a try as it has no sulfate or parabens. I was surprised how quickly these showed up at my porch and were packaged together in a way to prevent damage or leaking. I like the consistency, scent, and how this worked on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;  The top of the bottle almost looks like the top of a water bottle because there is a clear cap that prevents leakage. I removed the cap and the nozzle is like a water bottle in that you pull up on it to dispense the shampoo. The shampoo come in 8.4 oz. black bottles with white labels that have the design you see in the picture. As soon as I opened the nozzle on each of these I noticed the scent and really liked it.  It smells fresh, clean, and a bit on the tropical side (I could smell some coconut and other scents in there) but not overpowering. The shampoo is a nice consistency, not too watery, just right.  It&#x27;s an opaque shampoo with a hint of orange/pink coloring and the conditioner is thicker than the shampoo and a similar color. Next, I went on to scrubbing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;  I gotta say I really like the scent even though I&#x27;m not huge into tropical scents but still really like it.  Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lathering effect.  I wear a ton of hairspray and had no issue getting it all out with the shampoo and no hairspray left behind after the wash.  The conditioner is thick and coats my hair well.  I usually leave conditioner on the rest of the shower and wash it off at the end to leave it on there for extra conditioning.  I have sensitive skin and had no breakouts or reactions. All in all the shampoo and conditioner did a good job washing and conditioning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;  After washing and conditioning, I dried and styled my hair as usual.  I have thin, fine hair that I can wear either straight or curly.  This did add volume to my limp hair and left my hair soft and not frizzy, which is a common occurrence with my hair type. I did receive a discount to give this a try and give my honest opinion.  Overall, I am really glad I tried this out and I love the smell and was pleased with how my hair looked after styling.  I usually use whatever I find at the grocery store and this did a better job than the regular stuff I use.  My hair is also color treated dark brown to cover up a few greys and I had no issue with that either and my color hasn&#x27;t seemed to fade with quite a few washes.  I would recommend these products.d receive a discount to give this a try and give my honest opinion.

    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan, when these bottle came to me they had exploded in the mail. The label design looks cheap (despite a good logo) and the actual shampoo left my hair feeling weighted down.I received this as an Amazon review deal and an not impressed.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this shampoo and conditioner set. I have to say that the scent for of each of them was very, very pleasing. I especially liked since I have color treated hair that they both were color safe, made in the USA and paraben free. The shampoo did a nice job of leaving my hair clean and fresh smelling and the conditioner added a nice softness that was easy to comb through after my shower. I must admit that I didn&#x27;t experience a lot of &amp;#34;extra volume&amp;#34; once my hair dried, but it also wasn&#x27;t weighed down and felt nice to the touch. The set is a bit pricey for me, but I like supporting made in the USA products when and where I can.</li>
    <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling clean light and fluffy. I am ordering more.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how my hair responds!!!  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I rarely leave negative reviews, but on this shampoo, I feel compelled. I am giving 2 stars. One for scent, which I do like. Two for the conditioner, which is ok. The scent reminds me of Hawaiian Tropic suntan lotion. I don&#x27;t find it overpowering. Just a light, fresh, summery scent. I have very fine hair which started thinning about 10 years ago. I am 36.  My once kinky, curly hair now has only a slight wave and frizzes like nobody&#x27;s business. I went from 3B/C to 2A, for those who are familiar with hair types. It was always fine, but I had a very full head of hair. For whatever reason, my hair texture significantly changed and has never grown back. My docs haven&#x27;t been able to find a medical cause. My worst areas of thinning are at the crown and sides. My hair parts in the back, which is a double whammy. I struggle to cover my scalp. I also find I have to cleanse my hair near daily. After a day or two, it can look very oily, which makes it look even thinner. I&#x27;m sure there are many who can relate to how upsetting and frustrating this can be. Folks like us are always looking for the latest and greatest hair loss treatments. I work very hard to preserve and maintain the health of the hair I have left. I use Ion demi-permanent red hair color (7IR), which I brighten/freshen every 2 weeks with either Manic Panic or Pravana. I am also an avid Wen user. It has done wonders for my hair over the past year. Those products combined help keep my hair shiny, full, and free of split ends/breakage and frizz. All that said, I do use a regular shampoo a few times a month to remove any product residue from my scalp and/or silicone build-up on my hair. The only shampoo(s) that typically touch my hair are Nioxin and Paul Mitchell Tea Tree. Neither of which are particularly “red-color” friendly, but they do help keep my scalp clean and exfoliated and deep clean my hair. I avoid other &amp;#34;shampoos,&amp;#34; but this one had so many great reviews, I just had to give it a try. I wish I hadn&#x27;t. I lost more hair after 3 uses of this shampoo than I have over the past few months. I watched my red color POUR down the drain. It always runs red, but I haven&#x27;t colored in 6 weeks. I literally cried. With Wen and my regular shampoos, the red doesn&#x27;t run after this amount of time. This shampoo is sulfate free, so it doesn&#x27;t have a high lather, but you may find you have to use more product/water than normal to cover your hair. I have used many sulfate-free shampoos. In comparison, this one is sub-par, at best. You will go through a lot of product. When you first apply the shampoo, it has a lot of slip and feels very smooth. Unfortunately, after about 20 seconds, it works like a vacuum; sucking every last bit of moisture out and turning your hair to straw. When I rinsed my hair it felt like a matted mess. I am sorry to say, this shampoo is horrible. If you have hair like mine, or color red, I STRONGLY suggest you steer clear. Now, on to the conditioner. This product was surprisingly pretty good. It is thick and emollient. A little goes a long way. The shampoo seems to significantly rough up your cuticle. I found the conditioner quickly smoothed and detangled my hair. It has the same scent as the shampoo. I air dry my hair. After using these products, my hair looked dry and dull. As nice as the conditioner is, it&#x27;s not good enough to undo the damage the shampoo causes. My hair looked greasy by the end of the day. I had noticeable hair breakage and visible split ends after 3 uses. Highly UNimpressed. The ingredients listed on the labels are hard to read, but I’ll do my best. SHAMPOO: Water, sodium cocoyl isethionate, cocamidopropylamine oxide, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine (Watch this one. It’s known to cause over-drying and allergic reactions. It’s synthetic surfactant), disodium laureth sulfosuccinate (While not technically a “sulfate,” it’s a surfactant works in the same fashion. Common ingredient in most shampoos. Just as an FYI, this stuff is also used in industrial cleaners in higher concentrations.), sodium lauryl sulfoacetate (Not at all environmentally friendly. Toxic to fish and aquatic life.), glycerin, PEG-150 stearate, benzophenone-4 (Known allergen. FDA approved for use in sunscreen. Assuming this provides some protection for the hair.), citric acid, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, polysorbate 20 (This one is potentially dangerous. Treated with 20 parts ethylene oxide, which is a known carcinogen.), methylchloroisothiazolinone (anti-bacterial/anti-fungal), fragrance, Red 40, Yellow 6, linalool (Not sure on the spelling here. I can’t read the label. Could be a fragrance). CONDITIONER: Water, cetearyl alcohol (Alcohol, enough said), stearyl alcohol (Again, alcohol), behentrimonium chloride (Known human/environmental toxin.), sodium pca, sodium lactate, arginine, aspartic acid pca, glycine, alanine, serine, valine, proline, threonine, isoleucine, histidine, phenylalanine, hydrolyzed wheat protein (Careful if you have wheat allergies.), hydrolyzed wheat starch, aloe barbadensis juice (aloe leaf), mangifera indica seed butter (mango), theobroma cacao seed butter (cocoa), cetrimonium chloride (topical antiseptic), benzophenone-4, glycerin, phenoxyethanol, benzoic acid (Draw your own conclusions. From the CDC website: The substance irritates the eyes, the skin and the respiratory tract. The substance may cause a non-allergic rash on contact.; The solution in water is a weak acid. Reacts with oxidants.; Dust explosion possible if in powder or granular form, mixed with air.), dehydroacetic acid, fragrance, Red 40, Yellow 6, and again linalool? Overall, thumbs down on the shampoo. Thumbs up on the conditioner. This conditioner may work well for those who need more intense hydration or have thicker/coarser hair they like to co-wash. If you want to risk it, go for it, but my bottles have gone in the trash. These 4-5 star reviews have me baffled. I, like several others, received these products at a discount in return for my honest review.

    <li> I recently moved to the desert and my hair has been a mess. I wanted a product that would give my hair some volume while not killing it with chemicals since I recently lifted and dyed it a bright raspberry red.  I found this product while doing some research and was able to obtain a promotion where I received a discount if I tested it and gave honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was super fast, I got it within 48 hours to be exact.  However, once I received the product it had leaked/spilled a little and was sticky and somewhat messy.  The leak wasn&#x27;t horrible and the product loss was minimal, so a quick wipe down fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice, it&#x27;s not overly strong, and even without any chemicals to offer a fancy scent it was nice and clean smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have used the product 3 times.  The shampoo lathers nicely, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like straw, and it definitely gets it clean.  The conditioner is good as well. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but manages the tangles. (I use another conditioner on my ends because of the color treatment and lifting.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for volume adding- I have definitely been able to tell a difference. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the lack of sulfate and paraben that does it, or some other magic trick,but my roots and overall volume have been much greater.  Even after straightening my hair seems fuller and bouncier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are a little smaller than I would like because I have super long hair and tend to go through a lot of product, but it is definitely something I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I was excited when I received this sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, (being I have coloured hair), until I opened it. It was surrounded by big bubble wrap which I liked, but, the products themselves were wrapped very tightly together. After cutting the plastic, I  immediately  noticed a huge mess. The shampoo bottle leaked a lot, because the cap was very loose. I&#x27;ll admit, it was a bad start for me.After cleaning both bottles and myself, I gave them a try. The smell is a little odd to me for a shampoo, they smell like those little hotel sample soaps in hotel rooms. I really didn&#x27;t find anything spectacular about either the shampoo, or the conditioner, but I will finish them out. I doubt I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> My friend uses this shampoo and conditioner and her hair always looks so healthy. When I had the opportunity to try this product at her house, I absolutely loved it!! I bought my own and I have been using it for almost 2 weeks. My hair is softer and less frizzy, and the color hasn&#x27;t faded like it does with the harsh shampoos I have used in the past. I have tried a lot of shampoos and conditioners over the years, this one is a keeper!!</li>
    <li> Received this product in the mail a month ago. The first time I used it made my hair larger!! It smells great too!! :) I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in hopes to get help with my fine limp hair.  I found just what I was looking for.  I saw a difference the very first use.  I am 51 years old and u have never had an affordable shampoo and conditioner do this well for me before.&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy it is free of sulphates and parabin, but that causes the lack of lathering, which takes a bit to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product and will be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase this product at a reduced cost to give my honest and fair review.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo and conditioner but it was the first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo I tried and did have some itchy scalp issues.</li>
