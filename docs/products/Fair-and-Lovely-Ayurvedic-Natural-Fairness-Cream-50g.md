      <li>I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>it takes a while to see fairness and remember u will not be able to notice the fairness yourself.</li>
      <li>but I will not order again because I found a better product</li>
      <li>n0 comment be satisfied with my rating.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it during the day with a sunscreen to be safe.</li>
      <li>Perhaps over time this might work better</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>It is an awesome Unilever product (maker of Sunsilk and many other items).</li>
      <li>I am always looking for the best in face creams and have spent a LOT (Creme de la Mer, e.g.).</li>
      <li>For me that&#x27;s a good thing, because I tend to have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t imagine to live without my Fair &amp; Lovely.</li>
      <li>which I think is pretty effective in smoothing out the blemishes.</li>
      <li>I have darker skin, and this made my skin feel smooth, improved my acne, and evened my skin tone.</li>
      <li>this product chemical free, preservative free or ayurvedic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>mark free.  </li>
      <li>But don&#x27;t think this is a replacement for a rich, creamy emollient.</li>
      <li>I did weeks of reading ingredients, researching brands, and trying to find both a safe and effective solution for the brown patches that have surfaced on my face over the last year or so.  </li>
      <li>I usually use the regular Fair &amp; Lovely and I&#x27;ve always loved it.</li>
      <li>I thought this \\&quot;Fair and Lovely\\&quot; fairness cream would be the long term answer.  </li>
      <li>This product was as described and pictured; it smells nice, not overpowering and very light and absorbent on skin; not greasy at all; it does protect the skin from sun/heat and after regular use, it tends to lighten the skin, make it more even; it keeps the skin from being dry.</li>
      <li>I was waiting to see the results on my skin, so I could write and useful review</li>
      <li>I used to have age spots and uneven skin tone and tried many over-the-counter pricey lotions including Estee Lauder, Elizabeth Arden, Olay &amp; neutragena products, numerous fading and pearl creams etc, then I came across fair &amp; lovely which a Pakistani friend of mine suggested.</li>
      <li>It makes ur skin clear of all acne/marks and makes it very clean.</li>
      <li>but I only saw a very light difference.  </li>
      <li>It was the first time seeing The ayurdic one</li>
      <li>so i return back to this product again.i saw more than 4 different version (i love the 1st</li>
      <li>product.this is latest but less effective the previous one but still its far better than rest skin cream.</li>
      <li>My skin is in good shape, not many wrinkles.</li>
      <li>From there the smell was so strong I could not take using it daily...</li>
      <li>I knew there were two formulas and specifically wanted to first (older) one, not the updated (newer) one.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully I did not lack too much wisdom by using it anyway.  </li>
      <li>and it had to much &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Ehhhhh.... have not seen much of an improvement.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a lightening of my skin at all...</li>
      <li>It really helped fade this scar I had on my foot.</li>
      <li>i want in the real need of this product........</li>
      <li>I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The newer formula is reported to be far less effective.  </li>
      <li>I stopped using it for about four days, and almost immediately all my blemishes and pimples came back with full force.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This cream is, I think, both drying and fading but that has been okay for my uneven, summer complexion.</li>
      <li>It dries very quickly which seems to dry out my skin a little, but it does leave my skin feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive acne prone skin</li>
      <li>First of all, the product I was sent was different that what was shown on the site.  </li>
      <li>I first opened the product I was surprised how little there was, but I soon discovered you really don&#x27;t need very much to apply to your face.</li>
      <li>but I will continue to use it to keep my skin clear.</li>
      <li>But I was pleasantly surprised because within a week of using this product, 2 of the darkest scars on my skin that I had been struggling with for over 2 months became noticeably lighter.</li>
      <li>I like it so far.</li>
      <li>I am a 44 year old,</li>
      <li>So far I think it is working.</li>
      <li>my skin is totally acne free and it improve my skin complexion and make it beautiful.i tried other product in between for a change</li>
      <li>africian american woman and have just decided to learn to live with my skin changes.  </li>
      <li>It enhances your skin&#x27;s natural glow after about 2 weeks of use :) However, i would not reccommend for people with acne because if would just make it worse.</li>
      <li>It also helped clear up some blemishes that I constantly get.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been using it for five months, and I just got through half of the first tube.</li>
      <li>I was a little apprehensive at first, because I thought it would lead to breakouts on my skin.</li>
      <li>And the wrong product, its not the same cream as the picture its different kind and expired.</li>
      <li>I bought two tubes right from the start thinking that they were small, and they were</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got the different product,the picture is not the same at all plus I don&#x27;t understand why they always send an expired stuff</li>
    <li> I used to have age spots and uneven skin tone and tried many over-the-counter pricey lotions including Estee Lauder, Elizabeth Arden, Olay &amp; neutragena products, numerous fading and pearl creams etc, then I came across fair &amp; lovely which a Pakistani friend of mine suggested. I used it twice a day for a week and there was big difference in overall skin tone. I got amazing results when I used it for facials and nothing I have ever used could compare that. It does not contain Hydroquinonne(causes Cancer), it contains Vitamin A, C &amp; E and sunscreen so there is no need for a sunblock lotion. I still use it now &amp; then to boost the skin tone and always keep one in my vanity. Can&#x27;t imagine to live without my Fair &amp; Lovely. No matter if used by itself or for the most amazing facials, it&#x27;s just wonderful. It is an awesome Unilever product (maker of Sunsilk and many other items).</li>
    <li> I just received this item in the mail. I liked the price so I thought I would give it a try. The product took a long time to get here. Although it did arrive before it was supposed to, waiting a month to get it is a bit ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the product I was surprised how little there was, but I soon discovered you really don&#x27;t need very much to apply to your face. Just a small dot in the morning and a small dot in the evening. It goes on as a darker tinted lotion. It has a pleasant smell and feel to it. So far I think it is working. My complexion looks more even. I think its a good product and I am going to continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This is simply amazing! I bought two tubes right from the start thinking that they were small, and they were but I&#x27;ve been using it for five months, and I just got through half of the first tube. It has no smell to me, which is a definite plus. It dries very quickly which seems to dry out my skin a little, but it does leave my skin feeling smooth. It also helped clear up some blemishes that I constantly get. I stopped using it for about four days, and almost immediately all my blemishes and pimples came back with full force. I restarted my regimen with it, and in three days, they were all gone again, and my skin is completely fair and lovely. I just LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I am not sure that I would order this product again.  I have only been using it for a week, so I have not seen any results yet.  It appears as if my product had the expiration date scratched off and the tube had been handled before (tube was bent).  Hopefully I did not lack too much wisdom by using it anyway.  I will follow-up in a month with any results that I may/may not see.</li>
    <li> I am still testing this product out but I have seen some of my dark marks start to fade. It smells great! It feels good,but it is sorta thick or hard to rub in. I guess you have to get used to it.</li>
    <li> Hi    I am using this product Since last 21 years(i am 28 now), this is excellent product from india because of this my skin is totally acne free and it improve my skin complexion and make it beautiful.i tried other product in between for a change but my face saw acne in 2-3 days so i return back to this product again.i saw more than 4 different version (i love the 1st one)of same product.this is latest but less effective the previous one but still its far better than rest skin cream.Price is excellent too but shipping charge is painful.but because of this excellent product i need to buy .you can see effect in 1 week if you apply twice a day.i tried other product like multivitamin etc but they did not work for me.   I must say this excellent product i ever use.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my spot</li>
    <li> I am really happy with my purchase.I was a little apprehensive at first, because I thought it would lead to breakouts on my skin. But I was pleasantly surprised because within a week of using this product, 2 of the darkest scars on my skin that I had been struggling with for over 2 months became noticeably lighter. It also serves as a great base for my powder foundation and does&#x27;nt cause streaking or make the skin look patchy..and no breakouts!! All in all a great purchase!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Fair and lovely ayurvedic is the best face cream I have ever bought in my life. It makes ur skin clear of all acne/marks and makes it very clean. I used it regularly and I could see the results in 1 1/2 weeks. And since this product is ayurvedic, I am not scared of the after effects which it might cause.</li>
    <li> What I&#x27;ve noticed about this product after applying it every night for about 3 weeks is that, upon appliance, it immediately lightens my skin tone as a foundation or base would, but once it&#x27;s off, my skin is back to its normal color. Perhaps I have not been using this product long enough, but to me the results seem temporary. Also, this product tends to dry out skin. For me that&#x27;s a good thing, because I tend to have very oily skin. However, if your skin is naturally dry, then maybe not. Though the tube is small, it can be used sparingly as a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> They sent a wrong product that is very different from what is shown here. Amazon should ban them immediately. The item is too expensive.</li>
    <li> Bought one tube of the cream and really liked it because I think it helped my complexion. I don&#x27;t really notice a lightening of my skin at all...but I will continue to use it to keep my skin clear.</li>
    <li> I did weeks of reading ingredients, researching brands, and trying to find both a safe and effective solution for the brown patches that have surfaced on my face over the last year or so.  I thought this \\&quot;Fair and Lovely\\&quot; fairness cream would be the long term answer.  I was wrong.    First of all, the product I was sent was different that what was shown on the site.  I knew there were two formulas and specifically wanted to first (older) one, not the updated (newer) one.  The newer formula is reported to be far less effective.  From there the smell was so strong I could not take using it daily...so now it just sit on my vanity unused.  I am very disappointed and just too frustrated to ask for a refund.    I am a 44 year old, africian american woman and have just decided to learn to live with my skin changes.  The only reason I gave it two instead on one stars is because in all fairness I did not really use the product long enough because of the smell.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I have combination skin and I applied this over night and it didnt make me greasy. I use it during the day with a sunscreen to be safe. Im sticking with it. Smells great, blends in easily...I like it so far.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin and so far this cream has not broken me out and my previous dark marks are gradually getting lighter and fading. But the box did say it could take a few weeks so I am being patient.</li>
    <li> This should be illegal for promoting colorism and furthering racism.</li>
    <li> i want in the real need of this product........but they Supplied me an Expired Product.........i hate it......Cheaters.. Dont purchased this product.waste of money</li>
    <li> I ordered 4 face creams. One can last say about a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;Now, all 4 of them are about to be expired in a week or two, or have become expired. I couldn&#x27;t read the Mfg fully, because it seems to have faded. There is a blue dye look around the mfg area.. somethings up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I asked for a refund, let&#x27;s see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pain, to get a print out and go to the post office and post this package back. If I have to pay for the postage well..there is no point in doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like they&#x27;ve pulled this on another person here, cheeky fellas these people.</li>
    <li> send me an expired product! very disappointing. And the wrong product, its not the same cream as the picture its different kind and expired.</li>
    <li> I usually use the regular Fair &amp; Lovely and I&#x27;ve always loved it. It was the first time seeing The ayurdic one so I decided to try it. Big mistake!! After about a week of using it my face broke out in rash- like acne. I stopper using it then and it took over a month for the acne to go away. I had to throw a away the rest of the tube. Definitely not buying this again. I will just stick to the regular one</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, but I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin getting any whiter.</li>
    <li> I am a fair-skinned, Irish, 50+yo woman.  My cheeks tends toward ruddy and every blemish leaves a mark on my skin. This cream is, I think, both drying and fading but that has been okay for my uneven, summer complexion. I am always looking for the best in face creams and have spent a LOT (Creme de la Mer, e.g.). But don&#x27;t think this is a replacement for a rich, creamy emollient. It is, however, a piece of the puzzle in that it has helped my summer (sweaty) skin that still blemishes to \\&quot;calm\\&quot; and look great. Please note I am not a sun-worshipper, never was. My skin is in good shape, not many wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Greasy, but good for making scarred skin appear smoother and lighter. It enhances your skin&#x27;s natural glow after about 2 weeks of use :) However, i would not reccommend for people with acne because if would just make it worse. Also, it came with an added extra: a dinner mint. Of course nothing exclusive, but it was a nice additive !</li>
    <li> The product I recieved looks completey different than the picture. But, even though I recieved the wrong product I love it. It really helped fade this scar I had on my foot.</li>
    <li> I have darker skin, and this made my skin feel smooth, improved my acne, and evened my skin tone. I highly recommend.</li>

    <li> Here is the list of ingredients for your reference:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Palmitic acid &amp; stearic acid, octyl methoxycinnamate, glycerin, butyl methoxydbenzoylmethane, isopropyl myristate, potassium hydroxide, cetyl alcohol, dimethicone, titanium dioxide &amp; aluminium hydroxide &amp; staric acid, zinc oxide, allantoin, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, disodium edta, polypropylparaben, BHT, Perfume ci 17200, LAC,&lt;br /&gt;wheat germ oil +12 herbal extracts and milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see this product is not paraben free!! While fair and lovely marketing this as ayurvedic just because they added 12 herbs do not make this product chemical free, preservative free or ayurvedic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for 2 weeks and I think there has been very minimal difference. I had 2 recent blemishes on my face that I was hoping to fade but I only saw a very light difference.  Perhaps over time this might work better but I will not order again because I found a better product and I have also been trying just cleansing with lemon which I think is pretty effective in smoothing out the blemishes.</li>
    <li> F&amp;W always works well.&lt;br /&gt;i sometimes use it as a lotion after shave.&lt;br /&gt;it helps reduce the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;works great. it takes a while to see fairness and remember u will not be able to notice the fairness yourself. (obviously).&lt;br /&gt;unless u meet someone after a few months then they will be the only 1s to notice</li>
    <li> This product was as described and pictured; it smells nice, not overpowering and very light and absorbent on skin; not greasy at all; it does protect the skin from sun/heat and after regular use, it tends to lighten the skin, make it more even; it keeps the skin from being dry.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  In fact, I love all the fair and lovely creams. They are the best at keeping your face even toned and acne mark free.  It feels good on the skin.  It is not greasy, smells good, and has sunscreen.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> for some reason this product made my skin darker. especially on the nose and around the nose area. i am very disappointed with the results. besides, it left my skin very dry and it had to much &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; in it, that would give the illusion of instant brightening, like make up can. i have purchased this product elsewhere before, and it gave me a completely different experience.&lt;br /&gt;this one is either fake or unsuitable for my skin, anyway it is disappointing. i will never bye it from here again</li>
    <li> Great customer service, arrived promptly!  I asked a question and the company responded the next day with an email to me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was waiting to see the results on my skin, so I could write and useful review. I have oily skin and this cream is really good, my face feels smooth and the tone of it changes when you put the cream on. I absolutely love it, because I hate have oily face, but it does not happen with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have dark spots from acne, and It seems to fade away. I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I already ordered an multivitamin from the same brand. We will see if its good too.</li>
