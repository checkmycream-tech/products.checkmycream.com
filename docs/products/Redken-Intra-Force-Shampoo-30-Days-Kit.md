### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome.</li>
      <li>This was a good deal though compared to salon prices.</li>
      <li>I could do nothing with it to make it look good except wash it with another shampoo.</li>
      <li>, I am very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Good and somewhat effective</li>
      <li>Avon works better!</li>
      <li>Seems to have had a noticeable on the health of my hair, and it feels nice.</li>
      <li>The first wash with Intra Force was great, it made my scalp tingly</li>
      <li>The amount of hair breakage has reduced MORE than 50%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but then once I started using these products my hair started falling out more and more in the shower</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>Every time I looked in the mirror my hair seemed to be thinning more.</li>
      <li>Made my scalp tingle bit nothing more.</li>
      <li>My hair feels much thicker and looks great</li>
      <li>and i have chin length fine hair.</li>
      <li>Fabulous work</li>
      <li>Still waiting for the magic of new hair growth!!!</li>
      <li>and it felt so clean.</li>
      <li>But my hair is in pretty good shape just trying maintain as some thinning starting to take place on top.</li>
      <li>My hair was in much better condition, and certainly looked fuller.</li>
      <li>Cool.</li>
      <li>This kit is cheaper than in most salons, but to be honest, you can probably achieve the same results using Rogaine, which is much cheaper than this kit.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser recommended Intra Force 3 step treatment as my hair was thinning, and I was very aware of it, and very worried.</li>
      <li>This product is helping me very much with the thickest as it claims.</li>
      <li>I did read that you may lose some hair at first</li>
      <li>My hair was starting to get better after just stopping the medications I had taken that caused orginal hari loss and taking vitamins</li>
      <li>first of July I purchased this product to help with the breakage and the thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it advertised.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference in my hair after the first use.  </li>
      <li>The real deal, just a whole lot cheaper!</li>
      <li>My husband has not used this Redken Intra Force 30 day kit for his thinning hair for very long but is sure it is working.</li>
      <li>After towel drying and applying the spray leave in treatment, my hair had so much volume</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find hair so much tangled in my fingers if I touch it throughout the day or find hair on my shirts like I use to.  </li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>Works ok nothing spectacular,no better or worse than Nioxin.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this product as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>If you are simply looking to achieve volume, I recommend trying the Redken Body Full product line.</li>
      <li>I hope it will be available for a long time to come!</li>
      <li>The lost of hair on a daily basis was tremendous and none of the store shampoo/conditioners were helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for any guy who has thin/thinning hair.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with thinning hair.</li>
      <li>I ought a full set of supplies ..will try that before making my final decision but so far nothing beyond a tingle</li>
      <li>In 3 weeks the fallout had stopped and now, after a month i see fuzzy new growth coming in all over my scalp.</li>
      <li>but I am noticing some new sprouts - again</li>
      <li>Yes I still have the spots; no I don&#x27;t see new growth.  </li>
      <li>Bottle #3 treatment made my scalp itch and did not start new growth that I could see.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using for almost 3 months faithfully and she has noticed new hair coming in.</li>
      <li>My hair loss issue has stopped completely and I now have new hair regrowth.</li>
      <li>But this might be because my hair is not used to having the same products applied to it daily; for the last 2 years I have been alternating hair care products between biotin, protein and moisture to give my hair the balance it needed which seemed to work just fine</li>
      <li>I still have breakage, but nowhere near what I was losing.  </li>
      <li>but so far I have given the kit a try for about 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>So far I like the product but as the saying goes the proof is in the pudding.</li>
      <li>I have always had very fine thin hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff is ok, but I have always had thin hair, and I guess I always will.</li>
      <li>I had heard quite a few success stories on this product and had to try it.  </li>
      <li>My hair felt dirty and gross, and although it normally has nice bounce and body, with this product</li>
      <li>but the supply provided is hardly 30 days worth.</li>

<li> My hair felt dirty and gross, and although it normally has nice bounce and body, with this product</li>
<li> but the supply provided is hardly 30 days worth.</li>
<li> Its actually starting to feel greasy and flat.</li>
<li> I now have a full thick head of hair again!</li>
<li> It just hung flat.</li>
<li> However, my hairdresser tol me today she thinks she can see a little new growth coming.</li>
<li> It did absolutely nothing to stem the hair loss, and it made my hair dry, limp and dull (without its normal shine).</li>
<li> I even tried using a real conditioner after the toner, but my hair was so tangled and dirty-feeling, it was still hard to comb out.</li>
<li> A little expensive to justify when generic propecia from Costco is more of a bargain.</li>
<li> It is expensive, but worth the money.</li>
<li> I ordered the Redken Intra Force Shampoo 30 Day Kit from Amazon but received it packed with other items that I ordered, and it caused one of the bottles in this kit to leak</li>
<li> product is very expensive, especially the daily scalp treatment, but I went ahead and bought what I hope to last me several months.  </li>
<li> so I imagine I will need to use it likely for at least 2 months before deciding whether or not to keep using this product line.</li>
<li> I had horribly dry, thin hair with split ends constantly.</li>
<li> I am in my early 30s and for the last 5 to 10 years I have small areas of baldness, putting my hair in a pony tail has always been difficult.  </li>
<li> It does cost less at Amazon than where I get my hair cut.</li>
<li> I have been using the 3 items for about a week and a half.  </li>
<li> But looking at the hair it does look a LITTLE fuller without adding any styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have been using Intra Force for a few months now, and I will continue to use it.</li>
<li> Very expensive product and not sure if it really works.</li>
<li> so I am not sure if I will continue using this product line or not</li>
<li> This products leave you hair so hard they might break while untangling them</li>
<li> I am late 50s with hair loss from hormonal/menopause changes</li>
<li> I was beginning to get desperate, especially after my husband started noticing, and commenting on it.</li>
<li> my hair is thin but the product has allowed it to not get any thinner, and in some ways i think its grown a tad thicker.</li>
<li> The stuff you spray on afterwards is even worse.</li>
<li> That just made me feel worse, and I was also beginning to lose confidence.  </li>
<li> My hair started falling out even worse than before.</li>
<li> I did not perceived a dramatic result.</li>
<li> Expensive and made zero difference.</li>
<li> I was shedding like crazy.</li>
<li> but it got so bad</li>
<li> Absolutely terrible!!</li>
<li> This product is the WORST hair product I have ever used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The real deal, just a whole lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> I did not perceived a dramatic result.</li>
    <li> Seems to have had a noticeable on the health of my hair, and it feels nice. I only wish that it came in larger quantities.</li>
    <li> Expensive and made zero difference. Avon works better!</li>
    <li> This stuff is ok, but I have always had thin hair, and I guess I always will. This was a good deal though compared to salon prices.</li>
    <li> This product is helping me very much with the thickest as it claims.I have been using it now for about a month and there has been some improvement in my hair thickness.</li>
    <li> Shampoo and toner did make hari fuller. Bottle #3 treatment made my scalp itch and did not start new growth that I could see. However, my hairdresser tol me today she thinks she can see a little new growth coming.</li>
    <li> It does work, but don&#x27;t expect results overnight. My friend who cuts my hair told me my hair was thinning and to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using for almost 3 months faithfully and she has noticed new hair coming in. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I used this because the beauty school I attended used Redken hair products. We used this on clients and sold this from the school. It is a terrific product, I use it. It makes my hair visibly fuller. Highly recommend for any guy who has thin/thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This products leave you hair so hard they might break while untangling them</li>
    <li> Made my scalp tingle bit nothing more. I ought a full set of supplies ..will try that before making my final decision but so far nothing beyond a tingle</li>
    <li> I have always had very fine thin hair. I am in my early 30s and for the last 5 to 10 years I have small areas of baldness, putting my hair in a pony tail has always been difficult.  Recently I have lost hair and daily the amount would fill the palm of my hand.  For the last several months I tried different shampoo products to help with my breakage.  The lost of hair on a daily basis was tremendous and none of the store shampoo/conditioners were helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first of July I purchased this product to help with the breakage and the thinning hair.  I have been using the 3 items for about a week and a half.  I still have breakage, but nowhere near what I was losing.  I don&#x27;t find hair so much tangled in my fingers if I touch it throughout the day or find hair on my shirts like I use to.  The amount of hair breakage has reduced MORE than 50%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the fullness, it has been a lot easier to put my hair up in a pony tail without showing the bald spots.  Yes I still have the spots; no I don&#x27;t see new growth.  But looking at the hair it does look a LITTLE fuller without adding any styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very expensive, especially the daily scalp treatment, but I went ahead and bought what I hope to last me several months.  I hope this product continues to help with my breakage...that alone will help with the fullness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for awhile and won&#x27;t use anything else for my hair. my hair is thin but the product has allowed it to not get any thinner, and in some ways i think its grown a tad thicker.</li>
    <li> I have been using Redken intra force hair products (for thinning hair) for about a year now. I noticed a difference in my hair after the first use.  I feel I am not losing hair like I was before.  The product seems to add fullness to my hair.  It is expensive, but worth the money. It does cost less at Amazon than where I get my hair cut. I will continue to use this product as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I am late 50s with hair loss from hormonal/menopause changes and i have chin length fine hair. I was shedding like crazy. This product is the WORST hair product I have ever used. It did absolutely nothing to stem the hair loss, and it made my hair dry, limp and dull (without its normal shine). The toner is not a conditioner at all. It does not detangle the hair at all. I even tried using a real conditioner after the toner, but my hair was so tangled and dirty-feeling, it was still hard to comb out. My hair felt dirty and gross, and although it normally has nice bounce and body, with this product It just hung flat. I could do nothing with it to make it look good except wash it with another shampoo. The stuff you spray on afterwards is even worse. I finally went to a dermatologist who specializes in hair loss. He prescribed 200 mg of spironolactone (aka Aldactone) and 1 mg of finasteride (aka Proscar) per day. He said I would hopefully see results in a month or so. I did, too. In 3 weeks the fallout had stopped and now, after a month i see fuzzy new growth coming in all over my scalp. No side effects, either. Just my hair coming back.</li>
    <li> Works ok nothing spectacular,no better or worse than Nioxin. But my hair is in pretty good shape just trying maintain as some thinning starting to take place on top.</li>
    <li> My hair feels thicker but sometimes feels oily. I do not use the serum for this reason, only the shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Awesome. Cool. Fabulous work It works really well, I am very pleased with it.  My hair feels much thicker and looks great</li>
    <li> Very expensive product and not sure if it really works.</li>
    <li> Good and somewhat effective but the supply provided is hardly 30 days worth. A little expensive to justify when generic propecia from Costco is more of a bargain.</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible!! My hair started falling out even worse than before. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this at all.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it advertised. My hair loss issue has stopped completely and I now have new hair regrowth. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had heard quite a few success stories on this product and had to try it.  Jury is still out as I have been using it for only a couple of weeks but my hair appears fuller.  Still waiting for the magic of new hair growth!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Redken Intra Force Shampoo 30 Day Kit from Amazon but received it packed with other items that I ordered, and it caused one of the bottles in this kit to leak so I could not use the kit until I purchased it locally. I have tried a lot of different hair thinning and hair loss products over the last 2 years because of hair shedding related to hormonal changes, and all I can say is this is not the best product line I have tried nor is it the worst product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has not been 30 days yet so I am not sure if I will continue using this product line or not but so far I have given the kit a try for about 2 weeks. The first wash with Intra Force was great, it made my scalp tingly and it felt so clean. After towel drying and applying the spray leave in treatment, my hair had so much volume, I thought to myself, THIS IS THE ONE; however, after using it daily for two weeks, it does not give my hair volume, daily. Its actually starting to feel greasy and flat. But this might be because my hair is not used to having the same products applied to it daily; for the last 2 years I have been alternating hair care products between biotin, protein and moisture to give my hair the balance it needed which seemed to work just fine but the combination never stopped my hair from dropping. My hair is still shedding while using the Intra Force but I am noticing some new sprouts - again, it has not been 30 days so I imagine I will need to use it likely for at least 2 months before deciding whether or not to keep using this product line. This kit is cheaper than in most salons, but to be honest, you can probably achieve the same results using Rogaine, which is much cheaper than this kit. If you are simply looking to achieve volume, I recommend trying the Redken Body Full product line.</li>
    <li> My hair was starting to get better after just stopping the medications I had taken that caused orginal hari loss and taking vitamins but then once I started using these products my hair started falling out more and more in the shower and I didn&#x27;t like how it felt after using it. I did read that you may lose some hair at first but it got so bad I just couldn&#x27;t take the chance and keep using it!</li>
    <li> I was recommended to use this product by my hairdresser. I had horribly dry, thin hair with split ends constantly. This product restored the hair, and stopped the fallout in its tracks. I now have a full thick head of hair again! I would highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with thinning hair. One word of advice is to stick it out through several washings. You will not see immediate results, and it will take some time for you to get used to styling your hair (because it&#x27;s healthier).</li>
    <li> Seems to work....still in the trial period.</li>
    <li> My husband has not used this Redken Intra Force 30 day kit for his thinning hair for very long but is sure it is working.</li>
    <li> So far I like the product but as the saying goes the proof is in the pudding. I will know if it works once my hair starts getting thicker. Item came on time and as Seller decribed!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended Intra Force 3 step treatment as my hair was thinning, and I was very aware of it, and very worried. My mother had thinning hair and I did not want to be the same. Every time I looked in the mirror my hair seemed to be thinning more. I was beginning to get desperate, especially after my husband started noticing, and commenting on it. That just made me feel worse, and I was also beginning to lose confidence.  Not good!&lt;br /&gt;Once I tried the Intra Force treatment though I saw an improvement within weeks. My hair was in much better condition, and certainly looked fuller. It was stronger, and the hair loss was dramatically slowed, and in fact it now seems to have stopped. I have been using Intra Force for a few months now, and I will continue to use it. Would I recommend to others? Yes,without a doubt! Yes,it is expensive,but it does last quite a while, and for me, it is the only product that has made improvement to the strength and thickness of my hair.  I hope it will be available for a long time to come!</li>
