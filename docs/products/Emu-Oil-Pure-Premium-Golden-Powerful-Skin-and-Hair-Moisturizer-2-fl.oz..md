<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this before and was skeptical about all the rave reviews but after some recomendations from family I decided to try it and am very glad I did. This stuff is truly amazing! It really does help my arthritis and muscle pain. It doesn&#x27;t take it away completely but it sure helps more than any of those over the counter creams for pain! It also seems to last so much longer without the smell! I also tried it on my face and the next morning my complexion looks so good and my wrinkles were plumped up. I have oily skin but this did not aggravate that at all or clog my pores. It helps lighten up brown spots from old pimples. It also helps heal scratches quicker. I decided to try it on my hair and it does leave my hair soft. I think I just need to buy a big vat of this stuff and dunk my whole body in it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it gets the job done. Although for me personally it takes a while to see some results.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. Smooths out wrinkles and good for hair. I even used it on my dogs dry spot it helps and is safe.</li>
    <li> Amazing product thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like this oil makes my hair soft and make it make my granddaughter hair look good.</li>
    <li> Really like this oil.  Seems to be the only thing that works on my extremely dry skin. Also helping my edges grow back on my hairline.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m incredibly impressed, because I have been trying so so many products to moisturize my skin, and this is the only one that gives me the moisture that my skin has been craving. I am very prone to dry face skin, and my skin is extremely sensitive too. This is the only thing that I can use on my face that does not irritate my skin, even squalanecwas causing me to itch. I tried Argan oil, coconut oil, none of the plant oils come anywhere close except for Avocado Oil which i use also, however, I get mild irritation from that if I have exfoliated and for a day or two after. I can use this after exfoliating and I absolutely have to moisturize well after exfoliating and it gives my skin the moisture it needs. This is amazing stuff, and I am extremely picky according to myself and my husband. I also really really love that it actually absorbs completely. My husband will not touch my face if there is even a minuscule amount of oil on it. He&#x27;s extremely touch sensitive. With this he will touch my face because it sinks in so beautifully, plus it makes my skin silky to the touch which he likes. Also we are planning on getting pregnant so it&#x27;s great to know that my moisturizer is all natural.  Thank you so much Koru Naturals this stuff has saved my face! For people who have issues with the fact this is an animal by product that you are slathering on your skin, think about how you are actually consuming this product through your skin. You are nourishing your skin with animals just as you do if you are not a vegetarian when you eat to nourish your body.</li>
    <li> I bought this Emu oil for my hair and face when I use my infrared dry sauna.  I dispense a few drops in my hands and rub it through my hair, wrap in a towel and then do the same for my face.  I have my sauna set for 145 degrees and thirty minutes later I&#x27;m rewarded with glossy hair and glowing, moisturized skin.  I think its important to cover your hair up with a towel and also to protect facial skin with emu oil, and this is the best I&#x27;ve used, has minimal scent which disappears in seconds, spreads very finely and evenly and the bottle has a small hole allowing a drop at a time, no wasteful glops.  I also use this oil for scars that are left after mountainbike crashes, lessens the redness after the scab comes off, and then fades it completely away.  Another thing I use emu oil for is my eyelashes and eyebrows, just a really good all around product.  The vendor, Koru Naturals,  is excellent, I usually don&#x27;t comment on shipping/packaging because I have prime, but was impressed by the box, of all things (great to use for bolts, nuts, screws...so recycle !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my navel pierced twice, once without using emu oil as an aftercare product, and once with (I&#x27;m my own control group! :D), and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was honestly a little doubtful in the beginning. My first piercing attempt had rejected after a long and tedious 8-month healing process, but I had my heart set on the shiny, so I waited a year and got it again. (I believe the second attempt was also better placed, so it wasn&#x27;t all just the emu oil, but it did play a significant part.) Other than the oil and the placement, my aftercare regimen was more or less the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week or two into the second piercing, I began to get worried about seeing the thing begin to dry out, itch and get all winter-flaky. I&#x27;d heard of emu oil, and though I was a little skeptical, I bought a little bottle and slathered it on. And it worked! Amazingly, instantly, it worked! The dryness disappeared, the skin got all supple, and the speed of healing sped up like a son of a gun. I&#x27;ve been a convert ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a little less than two months since I started using the stuff, and this piercing is kind of at the same stage as my previous one was after four or five months. The first time around, I had all sorts of issues - it was dry, it was gross, it got all yucky and oozy, it took forever to heal... this second time I&#x27;ve had no problems. No. Problems. It&#x27;s been awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This turned into a comparative essay, but oh well. Nowadays, I&#x27;ve even given up using sea salt because it dried out my skin - I just use hot water and emu oil. The scar from my previous rejection is also fading, which I hadn&#x27;t expected to happen - is there no end to the greatness? :D</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have been so stressed this year and lost most of my hair. I rubbed it in at night. I had two skin cancer spots on my head. One in front and one in the back, the back is gone! and the one in the front is almost all gone too. I am so happy about that. That alone has saved my a huge bill from my dermatologist.  Its on been two weeks so I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in my hair waiting for that. Also I have something on my foot that itches like crazy. I have had it for about a year and tried everything. Put this on it and its almost gone but not quite. I love this oil, and will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing for healing piercings. I swear by it. It reduces irritation, inflammation, and itchy dryness. I lather it onto my ear piercings every night.</li>
    <li> This is my first Emu oil purchase.  This is a little more greasy and almost serum like then I expected. That&#x27;s not a bad remark, it&#x27;s just that it truly sits on your face for hours afterwords. I use this before bed and it sinks in for soft skin in the morning. I had a breakout due to medications and while this didn&#x27;t  make it go away, it definitely made the redness less noticeable I think.  Someone suggested on here to use it on your feet. I have horribly dry hands in the winter so I used this based on that suggestion and then put gloves over top while I slept. It worked very well.  This is a great addition to any medication cabinet!  Update: it&#x27;s been two months of consistent use and I have to say, this is the best things I&#x27;ve purchased for my skin in years. Lines have faded but the effect on an old scar has been remarkable. I never thought that would be less noticeable! I can&#x27;t wait for more time using this oil.</li>
    <li> I purchased the smaller bottle to make sure I liked it, and it was worth the hype. It is. I just ordered the larger size.  Magic stuff! My 3 year old gets painfully dry hands, and this worked great for him. I&#x27;m also using ony stomach for stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Arrived immediately and packaged well.</li>
    <li> I love it! I heard this is a better alternative than using castor oil which has a thicker consistency.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my scalp hoping it would soothe the burning sensation and hairloss that I am experiencing. I put this on my scalp and noticed that it made my scalp burn even more. I decided to give it 3 stars because I did use it on my face and noticed that my skin was very soft. I also liked how it made my makeup go on smoothly. Btw this is my husbands account.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, packaged well. Purchased to try and prevent skin irritation on my pets after having this oil recommended by an acqaintance. No noticeable odor, pet tolerates application of oil with no problem. Have only been using this a few days so can&#x27;t tell yet if it is helping. Will update review once I have a better idea of results...</li>
    <li> Emu oil is not like hand cream or moisturizer -- you don&#x27;t slather it on and revel in the pretty scent. It&#x27;s an odorless natural oil with no added chemicals. Use a drop or two and it is quickly absorbed into skin. The result is not as though you had moisturized your skin, but as though it is so naturally youthful and moist that you don&#x27;t need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family includes rock climbers and machinists who&#x27;ve been amazed by the effectiveness of the oil. I&#x27;m a writer, and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that lets me treat painfully dry hands and get right back to the computer -- with hand creams, I have to wait if I don&#x27;t want a greasy keyboard. The guys in the family also like it as a hair product, running just a drop through their hair for softness and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Koru Naturals emu oil is 100% emu oil. I&#x27;ve used it in handmade soaps and lotion bars, substituting a smaller quantity for coconut or almond oil, and I&#x27;m delighted with it. Real healing for dry, chapped skin without oily residue is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a miracle oil? We didn&#x27;t need any miracles, so I can&#x27;t report on that. I was interested to see that it has been found in clinical trials to promote healing of wounds and burns, so I plan to keep it on hand for that purpose, as well as for a super-effective hand and body moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any effects so far :(</li>
    <li> I started using this for a rash on my chin and I apply it twice a day and the rash after a few days is gone.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen any results with this oil, however my sister has been using it and said it&#x27;s working for her.</li>
    <li> The first emu oil I tried was Dr. Emu serum. I loved it, but it us expensive! So when I saw thus product on Amazon I thought I would try it. I don&#x27;t like the smell, it almost smells bad or rancid. And I find it&#x27;s greasy too, at least greasier than the one other product I&#x27;ve tried. I will try a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> During the past 10 years, I&#x27;ve used Emu Oil for Arthritis, Leg Cramps, Bruises, Burns, Dry Skin, and more. Emu Oil Pure Premium Golden is an exceptional product. It isn&#x27;t gritty and absorbs quickly into the skin. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t have believed if I didn&#x27;t try it, but this oil really helped clear dark spots on my face and its doing a great job with scrapes I got on my shins. By the way, I have dark brown skin and I have very oily facial skin. I tried it on my face at night instead of my usual night cream and it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t fee like I suffocating. I think my complexion has improved too. Will keep using for sure.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Makes skin smooth and soft. Not sure about the scar and marks. Its not as oily as one would think. The skin absorbs it very quick.</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonders on my dry hair. I am African-American and transitioning from relaxed to natural. After two years of transitioning, my hair is finally full, thick, and growing. However my edges are still dry and brittle. For the last two weeks I have been massaging the emu oil on my temples and edges and the change has been remarkable. For the first time in years, my edges now retain moisture all day and actually feel supple. I&#x27;m looking forward to experiencing the long term benefits others have discussed regarding hair growth. Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the results. I didn&#x27;t knw Emu oil was so heavy, so be careful of the amount you use. Smells wonderful. Looking forward to the positive results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and i think its working! i haven&#x27;t had any breakouts. on my face or my back. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll help with scars.... time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is i have to clip my hair back with i sleep so it doesn&#x27;t get oily.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading about it on a body mod website. It said it was good fro healing streached ears. I gauged up too fast and had painful micro tears. Rubbing this into my rationed helped it heal quicker. Also, its good for dry skin and hair. A little bit of everything product!</li>
    <li> Will definitely order more when needed. Great on dry problem skin areas.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected,  waste of money</li>
    <li> Ontime and what was expected as far as the product</li>
    <li> This emu oil has a great consistency and we have had great results with healing possible scars.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, excellent quality, great buy!!! Thanx</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for my dry rough feet!  I got this tip from an article about the world&#x27;s &amp;#34; most expensive pedicure&amp;#34; ( 1250.00 a foot!!!! Don&#x27;t ask me why it&#x27;s per foot. Lol.) The pedicurist said the secret was a crystal file and emu oil! I tried it and it worked!  I put the oil on my feet and put cotton socks on. In record time my feet are soft and crack free! This little bottle may seem expensive but after buying tons of other ineffective foot softener, I&#x27;m hooked. Besides, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is my second order and once again I am very pleased. Super moisturizing! A little goes a long way. I currently use it as a facial moisturizer, adding 1-2 drops in my hand then rubbing in my face. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is the best oil..we use it for so much! Love it!</li>
    <li> Super oil.  Absorbs into skin will without giving a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I think this work on bole spots</li>
    <li> Ok so I bought this mostly to try on my hair but with the secret hope that it would be the miracle oil that many claim it to be.  I got it yesterday, so obviously I can&#x27;t really tell about my hair, but I had to write a review today because I woke up with new hands.  While that might not sound that great, let me explain how bad they were.  My skin has always been prone to dryness--every winter when I was a kid my hands would get so dry that they would crack and bleed.  While I&#x27;ve managed to pretty much prevent that from happening in my adult life by applying moisturizer numerous times a day/night, I could never get them to really look normal.  For some reason this past winter they got waaaay worse.  I work in retail, and the machine that we use to clock in has a fingerprint reader.  A couple of months ago, it just stopped reading my fingers no matter how many times I tried.  It got to the point where my manager deleted my old data and so that we could reinput it to see if that worked.  It wouldn&#x27;t even let me input data.  It kept saying &amp;#34;no finger detected&amp;#34;.  We tried all of my fingers, and tried on about 3 different occasions.  It&#x27;s gotten really embarrassing.  When I showed my hands to my manager so he could help me pick a good finger, he actually gasped.&lt;br /&gt;I tried so many things- lotions, oils, aquaphor, all of the above in different combinations, sleeping with gloves.  Nothing made a significant difference.  I got this stuff yesterday and applied it probably 3 times before going to sleep (maybe that sounds like a lot, but that&#x27;s how often I normally moisturize my hands if not more frequently).  The most success I&#x27;ve had prior to this product was with a combination of argan oil and vitamin E oil, so the last time that I applied it before going to sleep I added a bit of vitamin E oil just for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;I really wish that I&#x27;d taken a before pic, because I woke up and almost cried they look so good.  I&#x27;m 25 years old and had the hands of someone in their 60s probably.  I&#x27;d be lying if I said that there was no more room for improvement--my fingers are still a bit lined, but the reduction in lines is dramatic!!!  Like if it keeps going at this rate, I&#x27;m pretty confident that I&#x27;ll actually be able to get the machine to read my fingerprint during my next shift on Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention that I&#x27;m very very pale and have a rather feisty little cat, whom I love but who has absolutely ruined the backs of my hands.  They were covered in red marks from scratches.  I woke up today only being able to faintly see one particularly bad scratch.  Seriously.  All the small marks are gone and the big one went from dark red to pale pink (it&#x27;s been there for weeks? months? I stopped counting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never be without this stuff for the rest of my life.  I&#x27;m a skeptic, and I read plenty of articles talking about how great emu oil was and plenty saying that it was no better than any other, and I was pretty much expecting the latter to be true.  But it&#x27;s not.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and I&#x27;ve bought several other things over the years that were &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; for others but not for me.  I&#x27;m so happy that I&#x27;ve finally found my miracle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay on my skin but did not work well on my hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this Emu Oil. It makes my face soft and I can really tell a difference in my complection! No scent, which is good and a little goes a long way! I also use it in my beard oils for my customers and they love it!</li>
    <li> I think it is fine, not used it long enough to tell.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil because my hair is thinning on top of my head, and it was highly recommended.  And as a female the last thing you want to see is your thick hair thinning, any where.  But, ironically, I decided to put a tiny bit of this oil on a scar that I had on my wrist.  I had ran into a nail months ago, and it left a keloidal type scar, that was a bit ugly.  But I started putting this oil on it, and low and behold, the scar started to flatten out and change colors.  I am still putting it on, daily, and hope the scar completely disappears.</li>
    <li> Works SO well on dry and rashy skin!  Very soothing and odor free!</li>
    <li> shipping was fast. I like this, a little heavy for my hair, but love to rub on my feet. The smell is not overwhelming</li>
    <li> Purchased to use on a tough read spot on my ankle, that prescription steroids didn&#x27;t totally reduce, this Emu oil has reduce it more, and taken the inflammation/red out.</li>
    <li> I saw Emu Oil on the Dr. Oz show. He recommended it for back pain. I bought this product for my mother &amp; she can&#x27;t believe the relief. She has since let other friends &amp; family use it on various joints with aches &amp; pains. Everyone has been a fan so far. I can&#x27;t vouch for other uses, but it has helped my mother with her back pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the seller goes, the product arrived quickly, and was as described.</li>
    <li> 1st let me say the shipping was super fast and packaging was good. The oil came with a tamper proof seal which tells me it hadn&#x27;t been tampered with prior to my getting it. This oil is odorless and very moisturizing, only used it a few times. SO ..YEAH SO FAR SO GOOD</li>
    <li> Great for reducing the appearance of stretch marks and scars!</li>
    <li> Great for joint pain as well as skin and hair!</li>
    <li> This is. Wonderful natural oil.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  If you are a natural purest this is for you.  A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This stuff has helped my nails grow like crazy and made my hands look better.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and it feels great to my tendons and muscles. My husband and I both use it and it is great to take on the plane in my quart size baggie. Gave soothing relief</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I over processed my hair and started to develop bald spots and nothing I was using worked. I am a certified product junkie so I started looking up natural remedies for this issue and emu oil popped up again and again. So I decided to give it a try and then came the task of which one to purchase . So after my research on what the product should look and feel like I started to read customer reviews because I don&#x27;t like to waste money . I ordered this product 7/1/14 and it arrived 7/3/14 which I was very pleased to receive it before the holiday and just so happens I suffered a burn to my scalp 7/4/14 and lost a little hair also it was a second degree burn that happened during the fireworks. Well I started using this product right away and the burn healed in a week and I started to see the hair growing back in two weeks . I could not believe it and the hair from my other bald spots have started to fill in also , I rub a small amount in every night and do a quick message the oil is  milky white in color and very light its like nothing I have ever used and IT REALLY WORKS .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; it is worth every penny and then some , I am getting ready purchase an 8oz bottle to make sure I do not run out . I purchased a 2oz bottle used it every day and after two months I still have half a bottle. I also used it on my face and I have oily skin and the next day I had this glowing skin I couldn&#x27;t believe after one use . And the people who run this company are the nicest people I have had the pleasure of dealing with , this is the only emu oil I will ever use . Try it you will not regret it while every product does not work the same for everyone with the same results , I can only say it worked wonderful for me and you have nothing to lose by giving it a try it was one of my best decisions in a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a good oil. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, for my hair. Works really well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any improvement for hyperpigmentation, but product is very greasy so less is more.  Delivered extremely fast. If you&#x27;re having skin problems I advise you to try raw industries apple cider vinegar with &amp;#34;the mother&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  been using it for about a month for my hair and now my edges are growing in.</li>
    <li> Wonderful packaging.  Just like it looked on line. Very happy with my purchase.Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been stretching my ears for some time using only unscented lotion to fight dryness that I face in the desert. I wanted to stretch bigger but wanted to keep my lobes healthy so I researched what I should buy to help with stretching and dryness. This lead me to emu oil which is basically a miracle ointment. If you&#x27;re vegan, pass on this because it does use actual oil from a gland on a real emu. I&#x27;ve been using this on my lobes twice a day for massage. They&#x27;re definitely happier and don&#x27;t get inflamed at all. I also used this on my industrial piercing that was taking forever to heal and had hypertrophic scarring. Completely got rid of the bumps and redness and my industrial hasn&#x27;t acted up since! I also use it on my face because I have very dry skin and have noticed vast improvements as emu oil has natural anti inflammatory properties.</li>
    <li> Sorry for the long Review.. I depend on reviews when I&#x27;m about to purchase and appreciate the honesty so here we go..I Love this emu oil, it&#x27;s the best.. I had ordered another brand previous to this but it was a little to clarified and thin.. You want it refined grade A but not clarified. So I used brand x first and thought ehh it&#x27;s just okay since I had never used the oil before, then I thought I should do a comparison before giving up so quickly. I then ordered this one and WOW!!! This worked right away and results are phenomenal and I&#x27;m in my late forties.. This brand of EMU OIL is like natural Botox because it is believed that all the essential fatty acids lift the wrinkles and loose skin by forming fat underneath like when we were young.. Everyone thinks I had work done.. HA HA, Oh and another thing I had brown pigmentation on my face that is now about 80% gone, this oil is no joke(; put it on as much as possible especially at night instead of your night cream. Probably not during the day or under your makeup, it is oil after all. It really nourishes your skin with it&#x27;s natural occuring vitamins and minerals and the Essential Fatty acids of course, So treat yourself &amp;lt;3.. Beauty Dreams</li>
    <li> Makes my hair and skin so soft. I bought the small bottle to try. Will definitely buy the bigger bottle when I&#x27;m running out.</li>
    <li> Definitely experienced hair growth and thicker hair!</li>
    <li> Only used a couple of times, so far so good</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Use for any skin abrasion or sugary scars. Way better then Vitamin E alone and absorbs very nicely. Lots of uses.</li>
    <li> Still finding new uses to this little bottle of oil.  Really great for re-growing hair if you have thinning spots.  My cuticles are looking great, a little drop provides wonderful moisture to my face.</li>
    <li> Great product! My little one has a eczema and I started to use it after her bath and it all cleared out. We continue to use it. It makes the skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I like this emu oil because it is pure emu with nothing added. It&#x27;s great as a moisturizer and is also good for cuts and bruises.</li>
    <li> Great product of multiple usage.  My wife uses to treat nail splitting.  I use for rough skin.</li>
    <li> Overall this Emu Oil has done wonders for the texture of my hair.  I use it on my face as well and noticed the winter is not drying out my skin as it usually has in the past.  I have had knee pain in the past, and after massaging Emu oil on my knees in the evening, I&#x27;ve had no aches upon waking.  I rub oil on knees before heading to work and feel fine throughout the workday.  Looking forward to finding out &#x27;new&#x27;  uses, but for now- face, skin, hair and joints are doing much better than I expected.  P.S. Love the oil so much I buy it for myself AND add it to my wish list for friends to &#x27;see&#x27; what I want for Birthday or Christmas. Can&#x27;t get enough of this!!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I personally, didn&#x27;t notice anything, and I used it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I liked this product very much, very silky.&lt;br /&gt;Foolishly I wish a product would magically make my lines and wrinkles disappear. My skin looked better and felt better. I will try it on my hair next!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re not using this and you&#x27;re over the age of 40, you&#x27;re missing out on a good, deep moisturizer. Absolutely love it. Plumps up all my creases and drags anything you put over it through seven layers of skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my dog&#x27;s skin when his allergies were just driving him nuts.  It quickly gave him relief and now his skin is all cleared up and he&#x27;s once again a happy boy!  Great product, and no odor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ecstatic that this is available from Amazon Prime for half the cost of an alternate brand from my local specialty shop! The quality is absolutely the same: same color, viscosity, smell (so slight you can&#x27;t smell anything until you almost inhale it, but distinctive...like..&#x27;Oh. Emu. huh&#x27;). I&#x27;m applying it to a gigantic third degree burn on my arm that I&#x27;ll be treating for the rest of my life, so I&#x27;m really relieved to find a better cost for this stuff. THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I use this on my bunion when it starts to ache. The oil will not make the bunion go away but it will help with any pain. I&#x27;ve also used in on my heels to soften skin and my knee for minor pain.</li>
    <li> I love this Emu Oil. I received it as a gift and have been using it for about 2 weeks and here&#x27;s how I use this odorless oil. In very small quantities, say 1-3 drops, I apply it to my pixie little hair to put the unruly strands in place in the mornings, and I also started applying it to a sunspot on my face and I swear, it is looking slightly better - I was and still am totally skeptical that this actually helps with dark spots but I am applying it regularly now. I also like to apply it to the my feet as it gets so dry in the winters here. So far, I can only say that not only do I love the feel and odorless nature of this oil, and the price is so reasonable I&#x27;d order a next one when this runs out but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that it may just help that stubborn sunspot. Thank you Naturals NZ, great work on this product.</li>
    <li> I have used emu oil for 15 years and when my other brand changed suppliers I needed a replacement.  This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. No odor, silky texture, absorbs fast.</li>
    <li> As told by a friend received temporarily pain relief quickly which is good.</li>
    <li> So far it is doing all that was expected - my facial skin feels great - will purchase again</li>
    <li> This small bottle lasted me a log time. And I saw results in my edges within a month. I recommend this for hair growth</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product twice and absolutely love it.  Not too greasy and works wonders.  Love It!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my aunt mentioned it was great for wrinkles. I looked up other uses, and read it&#x27;s great for thinning hair. I have rubbed it on my nearly balding receding hairline and I already have a patch of new hair! Amazing. I have tried endless other products, including Rogaine, and have not seen results like this.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for hair growth.</li>
    <li> Enjoying the emu oil-alittle goes a long way, my hair looks and feel alot healthier will be reordering in the future</li>
    <li> Was looking for something a bit more moisturizing than just facial lotion during the dry months.  Whatever else it does, I don&#x27;t know.  But, it seems to absorbed easily into my skin and feels nice.  I actually skipped the lotion and used just this one night.  My face felt supple when I woke up in the morning.  Like it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for moisturizing my skin or scalp</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says. It relieved my itching within a few minutes and helped heal my skin.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> this is great for anything, hands,legs,hair.</li>
    <li> I liked it. It came very fast</li>
    <li> It is amazing how fast this product ships out i have heard great things i cant wait to see the resulrs</li>
    <li> Great product. I had a spot on my face removed where a bad mole was. Within a month I could tell a difference.</li>
    <li> It works for my winter dry hands and feet but I do not consider it to be a miracle product as of yet. Quality seems okay, and I would reorder it in the future from this seller. It is a cloudy white liquid (oil) with not much scent at all. A little goes a long way for sure . . .  Recently, I started to add a drop or two to my facial moisturizer and my face is glowing, looks really well-nourished. When my knee was hurting after weeks of ice-skating with my daughter, I put some on for days and I would say that it defiantly gave relief from pain too.</li>
    <li> Best kept secret for fine lines and wrinkles</li>
    <li> i am sure what this product is suppose to do, but i&#x27;ve not seen anything different happen. what else am I suppose to do?</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people love this and there are tons of good/great reviews for it, but I do not care for it.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference after using it as a moisturizer; it just sits on the skin and looks greasy.  Will not buy again .. the only good thing I can say is that I bought a small bottle to try ... I&#x27;d hate to be stuck with any more of this.</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful product.  It keeps my skin soft and smooth which is sometimes difficult with eczema.  It also brings me relief as well.</li>
    <li> I use it head to toe &amp; am completely addicted.  A little goes a long long long way, especially for hair. Dog loves it too, put it on her gums.</li>
    <li> Product is great.  I put it on my knees to help them with my workouts and skin. I notice the difference.</li>
    <li> Great product that works wonders for the skin.</li>
    <li> Love the emu oil. Love the 2oz size. Works excellent on my skin. Perfect buy.</li>
    <li> I use this emu oil after doing acid peels on my face and it is wonderful. It does not burn or irritate my skin in anyway, unlike some of the post peel creams that are sold specifically for that purpose. It does not seem to cause me any break outs, however I do use it primarily after face peel not everyday. This is best for moisturizing at night because it does sink into the skin slowly and can look greasy on the face. Your make up would probably slide off. Hey that would make it good for removing make up! I think I will try this for removing eye make up. Oh, I also use this in my hair conditioning in the shower, I  mix a few drops with conditioner and let it steam in for a while before rinsing out. I use a touch of it for hair frizzies sometimes, it might be too heavy for very fine hair, I have thick curly hair and it adds a nice sheen. I think this emu oil probably has a ton of great uses I don&#x27;t know about.</li>
    <li> This product has no smell and it only takes a drop but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a difference yet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over two weeks and I can say that it has not only started refilling in my edges, it has removed the dark spots from my face.  And the product makes my skin and hair so so so very SOFT!!!!  I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I mix in a few drops with my moisturizer both AM and PM and it really makes my skin soft and plump (i am over 40). No greasiness either! This stuff is great!!!!</li>
    <li> I order this oil monthly because I use it on my face and hair. My skin is smooth, blemish and wrinkle free. I&#x27;m almost 49 so that&#x27;s great for me. I use it on my lashes and eyebrows too and have noticed growth. This is something that I refuse to be without. My husband is a mechanic and he is always getting banged, burned and bruised. He came in with a 3 inch burn on his forearm. After washing I applied this emu oil daily and the burn was healed within the week . I kid you not! I even put it between his toes because he has a problem with the skin peeling and it&#x27;s healing that issue.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this for me after doing some research online to help my navel piercing heal. I was amazed by how quickly this oil worked, immediately making my piercing look so much better. I was definitely skeptical when I put it on my finger as it just reminded me of white-ish vegetable oil, but the results are quite impressive. I also started putting some on some small stretch marks I have and my face, and already my face feels softer, though I haven&#x27;t seen any change in the stretch marks yet. I highly recommend this product as a general moisturizer as well as a great addition to my healing routine for my piercings. Don&#x27;t be deceived by the small bottle, a little bit goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I got this to help with scalp psoriasis. I would not call it a miracle cure, but in conjunction with prescription creams and shampoos this really does help by keeping my skin moisturized and healthy. I find I need to use the steroid cream less if I use this every night before bed, which makes a big difference in the long run.</li>
    <li> Slippery so good for massage. Provides relief for muscle aches and sunburn--really works. Absorbs slowly leaving skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> This is excellent for hair growth and it works wonders on the skin. You mix this with a carrier oil and rub on the scalp for hair growth. It can also be rubbed directly on the skin. It heals sores and cuts fast and it smooth scars.</li>
</ol>
