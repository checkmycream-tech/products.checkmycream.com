      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, especially since Mary Kay occasionally and eventually changes the shapes of their eyeshadows that eventually won&#x27;t even fit it, causing you to buy yet another Compact pro for even more money.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For how much money I have to spend to fill this thing up, it should really be FREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see why they can sell it for $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>It came better than expected.</li>
      <li>You might as well just buy the small one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compact, even though it looks nice, is still just made of plastic.</li>
      <li>Check that one out if you want a lower priced, high quality compact.</li>
      <li>High quality cosmetic travel case</li>

      <li>The only con I can come up with, is that the spaces in the front aren&#x27;t deep enough for more lipsticks or lip glosses.</li>

      <li>, Mary Kay has a tendency to change the shapes of their products every once in a while, so that you would have to buy a whole new set of compact and makeup in a few years.</li>
      <li>After a few months, the mirror fell off and I had to super glue it back and still won&#x27;t stay.</li>
      <li>Magnetic holding places re probably my favorite part, especially since I had a ton of the little eye color buggers floating about, and this makes my area look neater and cleaner (certainly less powder-y).</li>
      <li>It is a little difficult to open when its empty which is weird but filled it is perfect.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After weeks of hesitation and obsession, I finally purchased this compact on Ebay. I really love the presentation of this compact. It is made of high quality material, and the design is very classy. It feels expensive in my hands. I love the way the logo is printed on there, very smooth and pleasing to the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big mirror. I love this mirror. It is clear and bright and lets me see my whole face when I need a touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customization. I get to pick my own colors of what goes inside. I can combine different colors to create different looks for occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It carries EVERYTHING. All you need for a complete make up session. It even carries mascara and lip gloss. Very few other classy compacts allow you to do that. The only other one I know of is the Victoria Secret Makeup kit. Check that one out if you want a lower priced, high quality compact. But you cannot customize anything in that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For how much money I have to spend to fill this thing up, it should really be FREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It costs around $130-170 to buy all the makeup to fill everything in this compact!! That means with everything in the compact and the compact itself, you have to spend close to $200. That is A LOT to pay for makeup, to me.&lt;br /&gt;And, if you don&#x27;t want to fill it up all the way, then there&#x27;s no point in buying it. You might as well just buy the small one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compact, even though it looks nice, is still just made of plastic. I really don&#x27;t see why they can sell it for $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Mary Kay has a tendency to change the shapes of their products every once in a while, so that you would have to buy a whole new set of compact and makeup in a few years. I don&#x27;t know when they will do that for this one, but I hope not too soon...  So if you are thinking of investing in this as a long term compact that you can use forever, forget about it &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Innovative design, great quality product. Can be customized to your individual needs. But too pricey to fill up, and possibly will be discontinued in the future. In general, I would only recommend this if you are a hard core Mary Kay fan! It is a beautiful piece.&lt;br /&gt;But if you are just looking for a good compact that carries everything, there are plenty of other options.

    <li> This compact will be very useful when I travel.  You can build it with eye shadow/blush/makeup to your indivdual taste. I used it on a recent trip, and didn&#x27;t have to pack additional makeup items.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and is exactly what I expected. Fits my MK blushes, bronzer, mascara etc</li>
    <li> Great product as advertised. It was a great value.  I love Mary Kay.  It was a very quick delivery.  I am still trying to fill it up.</li>
    <li> I love Mary kay and this compact is a great way to keep my makeup all together! Product arrived on time with no damages.</li>
    <li> I know some arrived with a broken mirror or whatever but mine came exactly as it was meant to, perfect condition. I think it&#x27;s a seller thing, check your seller people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still had mirror film and original box, nice and clean... Magnetic holding places re probably my favorite part, especially since I had a ton of the little eye color buggers floating about, and this makes my area look neater and cleaner (certainly less powder-y).</li>
    <li> This compact is awesome! Love the HUGE mirror. Also, it&#x27;s great for customization (I don&#x27;t wear pressed powder, so I have more room for blushes, highlighters and eye shadows). The only con I can come up with, is that the spaces in the front aren&#x27;t deep enough for more lipsticks or lip glosses. Other than that- I think it&#x27;s great for storage and travel.</li>
    <li> I loved it and it was at a great price and I have already utilized mine.  I will do more business with you.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Quick transaction and got exactly as described!</li>
    <li> This compact is the perfect size for what I need. I am so happy that I went with the larger options. It is a little difficult to open when its empty which is weird but filled it is perfect.</li>
    <li> High quality cosmetic travel case</li>
    <li> I always wanted one of these unfilled and could not justify paying thirty five dollars for it. I am so pleased that I found this seller. It came better than expected. Now all I have to do is fill it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> they sent me just the mirror which sells for about $15 less. nice mirror but cannot put make-up in this</li>
    <li> Ah, now I see that what I ordered was actually for 2 cases. My mistake. I will just need to utilize it - that won&#x27;t be a problem.  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a terrific product.  Although, I had thought I was purchasing one Mary Kay Compact Pro Unfilled case but received two of them.  I will be returning one of them.  I do wonder how sending back 1/2 of an order works.  Just a heads up.  Thank you for the other one I can wait to use it as my original is broken.  Love Mary Kay</li>
    <li> Works great, brand new</li>
    <li> The product I recieved came in a Mary Kay box with russian words. After a few months, the mirror fell off and I had to super glue it back and still won&#x27;t stay. Whoever sold this, sold me a broken MK Compact that they probably got from another country for a lot cheaper, and are selling it on here trying to make profit. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, especially since Mary Kay occasionally and eventually changes the shapes of their eyeshadows that eventually won&#x27;t even fit it, causing you to buy yet another Compact pro for even more money. It would be a great product if it was easier to open, and the mirror won&#x27;t stop falling off.</li>
    <li> The large compact is great for at home.  I carry the smaller compact in my purse.  Easy to switch and swap.</li>
    <li> The compact was in perfect condition.  I was able to use it with the Mary Kay eyeshadow, blush, and foundation items I had on hand.  The compartments are magnetized and it is easy to insert the Mary Kay makeup.</li>
    <li> Love Mary Kay products and this case. I use them and give them as gifts and everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> Holds all my Mary Kay blush and eyeshadow.  It has room for a lip color and some liners.  Everything is in one place.</li>
    <li> The reason I stopped buying Mary Kay was the compacts/ containers were not included when you purchased the products! It doesn&#x27;t make sense to sell the \\&quot;holder\\&quot; of the product separately, especially since they regularly change the size of the \\&quot;pans\\&quot; of make-up, making your compact obsolete.</li>
    <li> This compact holds a lot of color! And the magnetic design is genious. I wish it held lipstick AND eyeliner AND mascara. For how large t is, I think it should be able to hold more. I could also do without the space to hold the mini brushes. I think the mini brushes are terrible compared to the real ones. I would rather they give me that space to put more makeup and I would happily bring my full sized brushes along with me.</li>
