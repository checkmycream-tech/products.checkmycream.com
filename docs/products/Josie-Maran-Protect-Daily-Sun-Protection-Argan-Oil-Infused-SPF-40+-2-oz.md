      <li>Best of all?</li>

      <li>SPF is great!</li>
      <li>Josie Maran Argan oil-its the best product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>It is luxurious and has a delicious feeling.  </li>
      <li>Until I find something that makes me feel as good as this does, I&#x27;d buy another bottle!</li>
      <li>It is a great product.  </li>
      <li>do know however that Josie Maran has a lot of great products</li>
      <li>I use mineral powder makeup, and this acts as a great primer for it.</li>
      <li>product is great.  </li>
      <li>I even like the smell which is pleasant and not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>:) I know !</li>
      <li>It has an SPF of 40, even better!</li>
      <li>I am really enjoying it!  </li>
      <li>Finally a high number SPF (40) combined with the Argan oil is the perfect product.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and it is very light.</li>
      <li>This by far is the best I have ever used!</li>
      <li>I use all Josie Maran&#x27;s products and I love them-</li>
      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>I think this is the best NON CHEMICAL daily moisturizer I have ever used!</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have to worry about any of the hype about chemical sunscreens and whether it is safe or not because it&#x27;s not in there.</li>
      <li>It does not get any better than this.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m sure others will find it satisfactory.</li>
      <li>After a few hours, my oily nose got incredibly shiny, so Boscia and Bliss win over this formula as they are more mattifying.</li>
      <li>, the moisturizer wtih teh argan oil just sat on top of my face</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I am protecting my skin from the Florida sun without having to put chemicals in my body.</li>
      <li>so if you have relatively normal healthy and happy skin I&#x27;d say give it a try</li>
      <li>However, I am pregnant, and have had to find alternative skin care products since most of what I use contains retinol and this is an ingredient to avoid during pregnancy.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>so this is an important consideration for me when selecting any skin care product),  3)</li>
      <li>Comparable to Boscia Oil Free Moisturizer with SPF and Bliss Fabulous Face Lotion with spf.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and light and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>: Contains argan oil, which I have heard fantastic things about.</li>
      <li>Light, inoffensive scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I just bought this product last week and have had amazing results!</li>
      <li>I do love argan oil or marajucia oil , it really helps deminish (not eliminate) fine wrinkles</li>
      <li>I appreciate the fact that he will buy me something that I never would and that I then fall in love with it because he has such amazing taste.</li>
      <li>This is a good sunscreen with physical blockers, however, if you&#x27;re looking for a sunscreen/moisturizer combo</li>
      <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>very hot, humid climates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been searching and searching for a good mineral daily sunscreen for the face - something that is smooth and doesn&#x27;t need to be rubbed in really well and can go under makeup.</li>
      <li>What a great combination of antioxidants and moisturizers and with a decent concentration of physical sun blocking ingredients!</li>
      <li>As a product - this is a nice sunscreen with hard to find ingredients and feels nice on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>does not make my skin look greasy,  4) does not use chemical sunblocks (I&#x27;m avoiding these because I want something more natural for pregnancy)  5)</li>
      <li>In the end I decided to exchange it for an acne product that was pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>right when I started using this product.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t think this is the right pick.</li>
      <li>for reference, i have combination, sensitive, acneic skin and spend most of the year in hot, humid climates.  </li>
      <li>The smell is too much for me - like they tried to overpower the medicinal scent of spf by adding a sickeningly sweet smell to it.</li>
      <li>if it didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout, i think i would like it very much</li>
      <li>still i&#x27;ve yet to find a light, natural sunscreen for</li>
      <li>Unlike most SPFs that I&#x27;ve tried, Josie Maran&#x27;s product:  1) does not leave a chalky white residue,  2) does not cause break outs</li>
      <li>Better yet get your significant other to splurge on you.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
      <li>I do not detect that natural sunscreen ingredients in the smell at all; just a hint of a light citrus note.</li>
      <li>, acne prone skin responded beautifully to this product), perhaps they might want to examine other potential triggers for their break out.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product because I like Josie Maran products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
      <li>It is also supposedly a good-for-you product as it is formulated without the chemicals in traditional sunblock and is paba free  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I try the very inexpensive sample packets til I find what I like.</li>
      <li>I really like this cream.</li>
      <li>I had been breaking out for the first 4 months of this pregnancy, and since using this moisturizer for the last week, my skin is already clearing up and looks refreshed and dewy for the first time!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to continue my search for a higher SPF day lotion that contains natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>My skin has become much more dry with this pregnancy, and the Boscia products that I used in my first pregnancy just didn&#x27;t offer enough moisture to relieve my dryness this time around.</li>
      <li>Who knows, this may become my new moisturizer/spf after this pregnancy, too!</li>
      <li>So, I have been searching far and wide for a safe moisturizer sans retinol and parabens, with spf.</li>
      <li>a scent I didn&#x27;t particularly like.</li>
      <li>High SPF factor (40).</li>
      <li>I used it for awhile and while it didn&#x27;t do anything wrong, it didn&#x27;t do anything great either.</li>
      <li>The product is light and minimally greasy, and the 40</li>
      <li>Did they apply the product to clean skin or did they make the mistake of reapplying it mid-day where it most likely sat on top of stale makeup and the sweat, bacteria, and grime from daily pollutants?  </li>
      <li>I do have to say I did try out the new foundation also, from an online and tv website advertisement that I could not yet find here on amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great having the SPF at 40 and this goes on without making me look a little pale.</li>
      <li>I have had rosacea for many years and some products are just not gentle enough.</li>
      <li>(I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve seen people reapply sunscreen or moisturizer on top of dirty skin and then express surprise when they break out).  </li>
      <li>When not pregnant, I have combination skin and use Oil of Olay Total Effects w/ spf and love it.</li>
      <li>but if you have sensitive or acne prone skin I would skip it.</li>
      <li>It gives my skin a soft dewy glow.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a natural mineral sunscreen</li>
      <li>So, beware all you with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t believe that expensive means superior); however, it does do dual duty as an anti-aging moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
      <li>In short, before assuming that a product is the cause of your break out, make sure you have examined other potential variables.</li>
      <li>Its a light, thin cream that soaks in very well.</li>
      <li>because it sinks in well, it doesn&#x27;t melt off as much.  </li>
      <li>I wandered into a big cosmetics store knowing nothing and came out with this as suggested by a salesclerk who was into natural skincare.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad product if you can get past the smell.</li>
      <li>I was previously using the Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day Lotion (http://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Radiance-Lotion-2-Ounce/dp/B002DMK0LW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1355845917&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;burt%27s+bees+day+lotion), but I wanted something that had a higher SPF.</li>
      <li>I have porcelain skin that is really sensitive and prone to breakouts yet is also dry and this sunscreen caused numerous zits.  </li>

    <li> First off I try to use mainly organic skincare products but unfortunately this sunscreen did nothing for my complexion. I have porcelain skin that is really sensitive and prone to breakouts yet is also dry and this sunscreen caused numerous zits.  A few things you may like to know: the product has a sunscreeny smell, slightly grape like too- a scent I didn&#x27;t particularly like. Also, the sunscreen provides enough moisture that you don&#x27;t need any added lotion- which is a plus. The ingrediants are pretty virtuous which is hard to find in a sunscreen- another plus. Before purchasing, I read reviews for the product on sephora and numerous people raved about it so if you have relatively normal healthy and happy skin I&#x27;d say give it a try but if you have sensitive or acne prone skin I would skip it.</li>
    <li> As an Esthetician I recommend everyone wear an SPF of at least 30 EVERY DAY! I tell all my clients to get this sunscreen. It feels like a lightweight moisturizer, not a thick, heavy sunscreen. It&#x27;s a natural mineral sunscreen so you don&#x27;t have to worry about any of the hype about chemical sunscreens and whether it is safe or not because it&#x27;s not in there. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Josie Maran Argan oil-its the best product I have ever used. Finally a high number SPF (40) combined with the Argan oil is the perfect product. Goes on smooth and light and lasts all day. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I think the price on this is outrageous. That being said I got it as a gift.  Now that I have been using this product for two summers I will never and I do mean NEVER use any other sunscreen on my face. It does not get any better than this. Its not greasy. It smells fantastic. It never gets in my eyes when Im hiking and sweating. No its not considered sweat proof but somehow for me it manages to be anyway. I dont feel like i want to wash my hands after I have applied it. Everyone who borrows some loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies buy this. Better yet get your significant other to splurge on you. Im spoiled by mine. I appreciate the fact that he will buy me something that I never would and that I then fall in love with it because he has such amazing taste.</li>
    <li> When not pregnant, I have combination skin and use Oil of Olay Total Effects w/ spf and love it. However, I am pregnant, and have had to find alternative skin care products since most of what I use contains retinol and this is an ingredient to avoid during pregnancy. My skin has become much more dry with this pregnancy, and the Boscia products that I used in my first pregnancy just didn&#x27;t offer enough moisture to relieve my dryness this time around. So, I have been searching far and wide for a safe moisturizer sans retinol and parabens, with spf. I have tried moisturizers in all price ranges and haven&#x27;t found the results I have needed. Well, this moisturizer is it! I just bought this product last week and have had amazing results! I had been breaking out for the first 4 months of this pregnancy, and since using this moisturizer for the last week, my skin is already clearing up and looks refreshed and dewy for the first time! I use mineral powder makeup, and this acts as a great primer for it. I am so relieved to finally have a product that meshes so well with my current needs. Who knows, this may become my new moisturizer/spf after this pregnancy, too!</li>
    <li> Unlike most SPFs that I&#x27;ve tried, Josie Maran&#x27;s product:  1) does not leave a chalky white residue,  2) does not cause break outs (I have combination, acne prone skin so this is an important consideration for me when selecting any skin care product),  3) does not make my skin look greasy,  4) does not use chemical sunblocks (I&#x27;m avoiding these because I want something more natural for pregnancy)  5) does protect my skin from sunburn and freckling  6) does moisturize....  Best of all? It gives my skin a soft dewy glow. I have tried tons and tons of sunscreens over the years (a must for my pale Irish skin). This by far is the best I have ever used! Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Finally, for those claiming that this product causes pimples (I find this highly doubtful since my own troubled, acne prone skin responded beautifully to this product), perhaps they might want to examine other potential triggers for their break out.  For example, were there changes in their diet, exercise, travel, sun exposure, stress levels and/or skin care regimen?  Did they apply the product to clean skin or did they make the mistake of reapplying it mid-day where it most likely sat on top of stale makeup and the sweat, bacteria, and grime from daily pollutants?  (I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve seen people reapply sunscreen or moisturizer on top of dirty skin and then express surprise when they break out).  Regarding diet, have they checked to see if they had a food allergy? (there have been studies showing a link between dairy allergies and acne).  In short, before assuming that a product is the cause of your break out, make sure you have examined other potential variables.</li>
    <li> sunscreens make me breakout but i was hoping this would not. regrettably it caused me to break out so i will only use it when i know i&#x27;ll be out in the sun and need a substantial sunscreen. it won&#x27;t be an every day moisturizer for me. i don&#x27;t care for the fragrance but it goes away quickly. i do like how it goes on the skin. it sinks in quickly, not greasy or sticky. i also like that it&#x27;s a physical screen and has argon oil in it. if it didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout, i think i would like it very much and i&#x27;m sure others will find it satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This is a good sunscreen with physical blockers, however, if you&#x27;re looking for a sunscreen/moisturizer combo like I was, I don&#x27;t think this is the right pick. This works well in combination with a separate moisturizer, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it by itself if you have dry skin. The product is light and minimally greasy, and the 40+ SPF is great!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. It&#x27;s great having the SPF at 40 and this goes on without making me look a little pale. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I gave this item 2 stars only because my daughter-in-law loves it. I had to give it to her when my face broke out in a red rash. Not pretty. I think the argan oil was the culprit. I have had rosacea for many years and some products are just not gentle enough. So, beware all you with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but this product deserves it. It has made my skin glow!!! Definitely recomend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Pros: Contains argan oil, which I have heard fantastic things about. High SPF factor (40). Light, inoffensive scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Stings my eyes a bit. Leaves an oily sheen at first, which means I have to wait a few minutes for it to soak in before applying makeup (not a huge deal, just a little inconvenient). Expensive. Also, not sure if this was coincidence or due to other variables, but my skin went through a period where it became EXTREMELY dry -- so dry that it would crinkle up like crepe paper, which I had NEVER seen before -- right when I started using this product. It was a little alarming and disheartening, since it made me look old. There were other things going on that that could have been attributed to (pregnancy hormones, transition to winter), but I still wonder if my skin struggled to get used to the ingredients in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I purchase this again? No. I was previously using the Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day Lotion (http://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Radiance-Lotion-2-Ounce/dp/B002DMK0LW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1355845917&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;burt%27s+bees+day+lotion), but I wanted something that had a higher SPF. Burt&#x27;s Bees never stung my eyes, was not oily upon application, costs much less, and never aggravated my skin. I&#x27;m going to continue my search for a higher SPF day lotion that contains natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried them all: drugstore, department store and luxury sunscreens.  for reference, i have combination, sensitive, acneic skin and spend most of the year in hot, humid climates.  sunscreens melt off my face usually... and then i think \\&quot;what&#x27;s the point?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hate sunscreen.  why?  it feels heavy on my face.  my pores feel clogged.  so much so that i don&#x27;t wear it, despite purchasing tons of expensive sunscreens to encourage me to protect myself from the sun.  (mind you, i&#x27;ll put some on when i go to the beach, but not for daily wear.)  this sunscreen, on the other hand, i don&#x27;t mind.  it still feels like i have something on, but it sinks in well.  it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, though i still get my usual acne breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for the \\&quot;melt off factor\\&quot; this product is an improvement, but not full solution.  because it sinks in well, it doesn&#x27;t melt off as much.  still i&#x27;ve yet to find a light, natural sunscreen for very hot, humid climates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I have been searching and searching for a good mineral daily sunscreen for the face - something that is smooth and doesn&#x27;t need to be rubbed in really well and can go under makeup. This is perfect!!!! One look at the ingredients list and I was sold... What a great combination of antioxidants and moisturizers and with a decent concentration of physical sun blocking ingredients!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with frequent breakouts and few lines, am 49. I really wanted to like this product because I like Josie Maran products. For me this lotion was a little heavy. I had to be careful not to get it too close to my eyes or else they would water all day. I used it for awhile and while it didn&#x27;t do anything wrong, it didn&#x27;t do anything great either. In the end I decided to exchange it for an acne product that was pricey but worth it. For SPF, I use AVON product that I sell. I try the very inexpensive sample packets til I find what I like.</li>
    <li> As a product - this is a nice sunscreen with hard to find ingredients and feels nice on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;But customers - beware - this product is almost 1.5 more expensive on Amazon (plus shipping) than at Sephora stores.</li>
    <li> Its unfortunate they aren&#x27;t bringing this brand back.  People are gouging online.  It is a great product.  It smells amazing and it is very light.</li>
    <li> I used argan oil by itself before , and in comparisment to that for my skin, keep in mind everyones skin is differnt! , the moisturizer wtih teh argan oil just sat on top of my face and I just had this oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;For me it simply did not work, as I could not imagine wearing my foundation over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do know however that Josie Maran has a lot of great products so I would say give it a try. I do have to say I did try out the new foundation also, from an online and tv website advertisement that I could not yet find here on amazon. The foundation goes on white and matches your skin, but only comes in 3 or 4 shades, and is supposed to match  your skin color, for me it was definitely not a match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the company as well as amazon have an awesome return policy so unless you can try it in stores, give it a try , as i said everyones skin is differnent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall I do love argan oil or marajucia oil , it really helps deminish (not eliminate) fine wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;i have dry skin, mid 40th, hormonal acne flare, yikes :) I know ! and both oils definitely helped heal&lt;br /&gt;better then any dr. prescribed harsh cremes</li>
    <li> There is nothing worse then using a sunscreen on your face and it gets in the eyes or messes up your complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great.  It makes my skin feel soft and silky, doesn&#x27;t melt and run into my eyes, or make my skin break out by being too oily or get dried out by not being moist enough.  It works under make up and it works alone.  An excellent way to protect your face from the sun.  the ingredients Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide are what my dermatologist recommends to me to look for in getting the best protection.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I am protecting my skin from the Florida sun without having to put chemicals in my body.I think this is the best NON CHEMICAL daily moisturizer I have ever used! It has an SPF of 40, even better! I do not detect that natural sunscreen ingredients in the smell at all; just a hint of a light citrus note. I use all Josie Maran&#x27;s products and I love them-I do not get any breakouts either.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product if you can get past the smell. Its a light, thin cream that soaks in very well. Comparable to Boscia Oil Free Moisturizer with SPF and Bliss Fabulous Face Lotion with spf. After a few hours, my oily nose got incredibly shiny, so Boscia and Bliss win over this formula as they are more mattifying. The smell is too much for me - like they tried to overpower the medicinal scent of spf by adding a sickeningly sweet smell to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally decided to pay some attention to my skin.  I wandered into a big cosmetics store knowing nothing and came out with this as suggested by a salesclerk who was into natural skincare.  I am really enjoying it!  It is luxurious and has a delicious feeling.  I apply this moisturizer in the morning after washing my face and putting on some collagen serum.  A little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s thick enough so you can see where you are rubbing it in, but doesn&#x27;t leave a whitish film.  It gives my skin a dewy finish (I&#x27;m guessing from the infusion of Argan oil in the product that helps to moisturize the skin).  It has an SPF of 40+ which is awesome too!  I even like the smell which is pleasant and not overpowering.  It is also supposedly a good-for-you product as it is formulated without the chemicals in traditional sunblock and is paba free  The only thing I would change is the price which is a little steep (I don&#x27;t believe that expensive means superior); however, it does do dual duty as an anti-aging moisturizer and sunscreen. Until I find something that makes me feel as good as this does, I&#x27;d buy another bottle!</li>
