<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Besides the fact that it got here late I was still able to remove my keloids!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my daughter&#x27;s acne spots. Great stuff. Great for scrapes and scratches, too.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. I use it to calm my itchy, irritated scalp in the winter. I put a few drops into the palm of my hand, rub my hands together and massage it into my scalp. I also add a few drops to my shampoo. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it smells like turpentine!</li>
    <li> Love it, quick shipping, great price</li>
    <li> I put a few drops in my shampoo and I love it! Great price</li>
    <li> I just started using for skin, hair and aromatherapy.  So far its working well</li>
    <li> This is my first time of getting this product. I plan to also use it for pains.</li>
    <li> I am new to the Essential oil fun BUT I love these oils/bottles. Very high quality for the money and also comes with a pamphlet for those people (like me) who are just learning things. Great Find!</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I mix a drop with my facial moisturizer and put it on everyday. I has really made a difference with my acne. I would have 5-6 new zits everyday, always on my chin. After using this it was down to maybe 1 a day, if that and they were never as bad. I&#x27;m not going to lie, it smells like Pine-Sol... but if you can get over the smell it really is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Use this for a lot. I like to put a few drops in my humidifier when I&#x27;m feeling sick and it definitely helps me get better faster.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use around the house. I use it to clean my face and I have heard it is great for a disinfectant. Do NOT use around cats ( not sure about dogs )</li>
    <li> Well aside from the smell it seems to be working great for my acne. I use it with rice flour, honey and water. I mix it all up for a mask and keep it on for 20 min and i really see results.</li>
    <li> Works on cuts and bruises so much faster then commercial cut salve.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using it, I like the smell</li>
    <li> Was great just a little pricy for the size</li>
    <li> I love tea tree oil.  It can be used for a number of things. From your body to household cleanser.  I make sure I keep a bottle around the house at all times, especially in the summer months for mosquitos.</li>
    <li> I found this oil to be a good bargain.  I use it in my Fuzzibunz diaper bag to mask the odor of dirty diapers.  It&#x27;s pretty strong at first and has a medicinal scent (it&#x27;s supposed to) but it wears down pretty quickly to just diminishing the diaper odor without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love tea tree oil and this one it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
    <li> I love this! I was so excited to use this, because it has so many good uses. I will definitely be buying more essential oils from Edens Garden.</li>
    <li> First, I would like to say that the buying experience from Edens Garden is great.  I specifically ordered the Tea Tree oil for a bath salt recipe I tailored into a foot-soak.  I was asked to make this for a friend of mine, who has really bad foot odor!  Tea Tree oil has anti-fungal properties, and also smells great.  This oil is great quality, true to its %100 pure label, and blended well in my recipe.</li>
    <li> I really like this Tree Oil! first of the price is great! and I would like to mention that I use it as Deodorant!(I saw that on the DR. OZ show) I use a few drops on fingers and use it Instead of deodorant! It has a great smell and No breakouts! I also use some drops on my toe nails which helps keep them looking not so yellow..The Tree Oil is like an antiseptic as well and have used it on other parts of the body! This stuff is the Best!!!! I would really recommend everyone give this a try! I have even used a couple drops in my car for a nice fresh smell!! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!  I am not a paid spokesperson just a happy customer who has used this oil for some time and always finding new ways of using it..I have to order more already!</li>
    <li> This is not a review of this specific product, but a warning to those out there planning to use it for break outs. Yes, if you dab a little bit of undiluted tea tree oil onto break-outs (I used a Q-tip), they will disappear within a day or two. HOWEVER, you may end up with hyper-pigmentation on that spot, as it happened to me. Now, I&#x27;m trying to get rid of all the dark spots on my face.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil saved my skin. It cleared me up so well!! That being said I still have scars and acne but tea tree oil really does work wonders. Also in not sure if it&#x27;s because of my carelessness that I keep on breaking out. Like from waxing my face/ eating certain things/ etc. I do NOT break out nearly as much as I used to though. It&#x27;s like a few pimples I just have a lot of redness. If you can&#x27;t take the sting then I would dilute it but I usually just put in on my skin directly. If it RLLY burns I put a thin layer of coconut oil on top of it. But it&#x27;s good for ur hair too so there are so many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But instead of buying from here just go to Walgreens you can get 1 fl of bottle for 10 bucks which is a better deal for me because I payed $6 in total (including shipping) for a third of the product.</li>
    <li> I used this during a time I had an upper respiratory type cold...........it was a comfort</li>
    <li> Love it, great product, will buy again from them in the future</li>
    <li> Best spot treatment for acne prone skin by far</li>
    <li> Item was as described,  fast shipping!! Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this in everything - good EO</li>
    <li> Product is exactly what I expected.  Shipped fast and great prices.  I would order from here again.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this particular Tea Tree.  I have purchased Aura Cacia brand prior and I liked this type better. I had bug bites all over my feet and ankles and this has helped with the itch and the healing process had been shorter.  Didnt even mind using because aroma was nice.</li>
    <li> I have been using TTO on my skin in the evening and I have noticed a huge difference! I mix 1-5 drops into my evening moisturizer and also use it as a spot treatment during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try for your skin -- has a wonderful herbal smell and feels so therapeutic and relaxing!</li>
    <li> This oil doesn&#x27;t give me the tingling feeling on my scalp like I was expecting</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and I use this old school remedy to clean and quickly dry up my monthly hormonal blemishes. I recommend doing this at night, on a freshly cleaned face, before moisturizing. Dab a small amount directly on the breakout and let it air dry. Leave the blemish alone. (Don&#x27;t be tempted to pick!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Not recommended for severely broken out faces.</li>
    <li> well the product shipped fast and it was intact when it shipped. It shipped so fast it was before the ETA stated by amazon. I dunno how they did it but it was probably because the seller has a facility near my house. About the quality of the product it is tea tree oil all right. I was hoping it would help me with my dandruff but it didnt work as well as others described it to be. Not because it is dilluted or anything. I think tea tree doesnt work for me and my itchies hahahaha! I use it as an additional cleaning agent for my dreads along with lavender essential oil. I would be buying a bigger bottle soon. Reasonably priced and good quality.    *dandruff*  although it didnt work as a magical oil removing all the dandruff like a magic potion or anything it kept it at bay i guess. Cause I had less flaking and itchies when i used the essential oil. Dont get me wrong it does help but in the end its just an essential oil.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled. I think I&#x27;ll stick with my other brand.</li>
    <li> I got the product in a quick fast manner, i have no complaints! awesome product cannot wait to get more!</li>
    <li> Love it, love edens garden!</li>
    <li> Not sure what this is suppose to do.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to heal my bruise nor my scars.  All it does is smell up the place.</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly amazing. It does wonders for healing.</li>
    <li> really didnt work on the skin tags</li>
    <li> I got into essential oils about a year ago and while there are a lot of them out there, Tea Tree Oil is by far my favorite as it&#x27;s the fastest working Anti-Viral, Anti-Bacterial, and Anti-Fungal I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some reviews of people who have purchased this and complain about burning or pain while using it. You need to remember that Tea Tree Oil is potent at 100% concentration and WILL irritate most peoples skin. Figuring prescription medications that include Tea Tree Oil contain 20% or less you can make your own concentration. For everyday use on cuts and scrapes I use a 5% mixture, for stronger uses like athletes foot I use a 10% mixture, and for nail fungus I&#x27;ve used a 20% mixture however I generally use 2 drops of 100% concentration directly on the nail.</li>
    <li> Works well for any fungus on toes and many other maladies that plague us at any age.  I would recommend that we all have this&lt;br /&gt;on hand.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I bought this product to treat a toe fungus that had basically took over the nail and turned it black while killing all the good nail- I was treating a family member. The tea tree oil has a very strong smell but it works very well. After 2 applications a day- night and morning, and a little over 3 months the toe nail fungus is almost completely gone! I was a little surprised how little 10mL is but it can last a long time if you use it right.  **When treating something with tea tree oil you don&#x27;t need a lot- a saturated q-tip will do the job. Please consult your doctor if you wish to treat injuries or any other bodily functions with therapeutic oils due to the possibility of greatly harming yourself or allergic reaction.  4 stars because:  -Harsh smell  -Works great  -Small amount</li>
    <li> Great item at good price helps to take away the pain of illness and injury.</li>
    <li> I am happy that I tried this product! I have had horrible acne, the big under the skin sore ones, due to some hormone therapy. I have tried everything. Bought a pricy Clairesonic, Dermalogica products, Acnefree, have dermatologist prescribe rx&#x27;s and nothing working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews that this is good for acne and lo and behold it works! Maybe I was doing too much to my skin and causing it to worsen. All I use now is the Neutrogena basic bar (the gold one) and tea tree oil! I use it like a toner, put a drop or two on a cottonball with witch hazel at night. I dont use it during the day b/c it has a really strong smell. But hey it works and was really cheap!</li>
    <li> Ordered it for my boyfriend he loves it</li>
    <li> I bought this tea tree oil and was pleased overall -- the oil was well-packaged, a quality product delivered on time. It&#x27;s got great soothing qualities for skin and hair, and can also be used homeopathically and very effectively as an insect repellent in nooks and crannies under cabinets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, please BE WARNED. Tea tree oil is also VERY toxic, a fact I wish I&#x27;d known before purchase, because I was spraying it liberally on sleep pillows with lavender, all sorts of stuff, simply thinking it would add a pleasant scent (which it did). However, recent articles I found floored me because I quickly realized tea tree oil is highly toxic to children and animals, ESPECIALLY cats, who evidently need only a small topical exposure in some cases to lead directly liver failure and death!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be warned -- it&#x27;s a great essential oil and offers many proven homeopathic remedies, but if you are a cat owner, use with extreme caution, and never in ways that will result in direct contact with your cat. NEVER use it as a pet shampoo additive, and keep it away from pets and children. Use cautiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s pleasant, more than fairly priced, and mixes well with lavender and rosemary for pleasant scents in linen closets or under cabinets. Just use it carefully!</li>
    <li> I love Tea Tree Oil and this of course is the highest quality oil I&#x27;ve found. I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything less than perfection in a bottle from Eden&#x27;s Garden, they never disappoint!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I discovered tee tree oil, it has to be the most beneficial oil i ever owned. It is the best product for hair and has multiple uses for the skin and body. I know I will always have a bottle in my household.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this oil. It worked PHENOMINALLY well when I used it for my skin to clear up acne that I had (I&#x27;d been dealing with breakouts since middle school). I did mildly dilute it before applying it with a q tip and when I did have blemishes, they were completely gone by the next day. I really suggest this oil to anyone who is looking to add an &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; solution to their skin care routine and is wanting to include tea tree in their treatment. I&#x27;ve since stopped using it, but only because I no longer have any issues with acne and this little bottle did WONDERS to get me to this point! Definitely pick this up!</li>
    <li> Excellent , amazing product.  I&#x27;m loving it ;)</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Seems to be pure and works well to keep small wounds disinfected and healed up.</li>
    <li> Good product and good company</li>
    <li> Good product for the money</li>
    <li> Works great for keloids from piercings.</li>
    <li> Did what I bought it for - to remove some skin tags.  But it does stink to high heaven!! So plan to use it when you are not going any where and wear old clothes in case you spill any on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for everything. From adding it to shampoo even had an eye infection. Just so happened to find out it was good for that. Used it on the outter perimeter of my eye. Immediate relief. Infection and swelling cleared in 1 day</li>
    <li> Works great!  Great price!!</li>
    <li> Using it for a toenail fungus so not sure if it will work or how long it takes to start working if successful.  Using it twice a day though.  Does not have a pleasant smell but if it works....who cares about the smell.</li>
    <li> Very good price for this oil. Usually expensive everywhere else. 10+ dollars.  Great natural antiseptic for minor cuts and scratches.</li>
    <li> Great product and scent.  Has multiple applications.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible but it does work well on acne</li>
    <li> One effective ingredients in a topical application.  So far, after a few weeks usage, the results are promising! I am pleased and hopeful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real stuff...and the price was fair, imo.</li>
    <li> Very strong smell. I love mixing this into my beard oil recipes.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF BURNS LIKE HELL......I PUT ALITTLE ON A CUT,OMG!!!!   I HAD TO WIPE IT OFFF ASAP!!!! DO NOT BUT THIS ITEM!!!!! WILL BURN,AND TRUNED MY SKIN RED ALSO!!!</li>
    <li> This oil works great for my acne and reduces the scarring I have from previous breakouts. This oil can also be used for many other things but my purchase purpose was for my scars.</li>
    <li> I love Edens garden oils! why spend 3 times more on oils from home based businesses. good quality</li>
    <li> I never have any issues with ordering. I never had to return anything yet.</li>
    <li> I found this oil to be most satisfying.  It&#x27;s strong and effective, has a nice smile that isn&#x27;t terribly pharmacuetical, and it&#x27;s a great bargain with this price.  It&#x27;s a good liquidy consistency and it&#x27;s been mixing well with even water. I also find the bottle and labeling to be quite charming, and it&#x27;s looks nice on my shelf with my other oils.</li>
    <li> Perfect for skin issue.I used this diluted 1:1 with olive oil on my grand son crate cap at birth, as well as some other scaly dry area on his body it was gone is 2-3 days. He is now 14 month and it has never returned</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this off and on for a few months now for a nail fungus issue. I have seen good results so far. It takes a loooooong time for the nail to grow out and you constantly have to use it. It is very potent.</li>
    <li> this oil smells VERY strong and not so sweet and flowery - to me its like camphor, but its GOOD therapeutic oil! Been using on feet for me and kids and it works GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;Also I read somewhere that these type of oils should not be used directly on skin, but instead combined with carrier oils (almond, apricot, olive, avocado, etc)&lt;br /&gt;I love this Tea Tree oil and its been helping our family fight fungus, bacteria, etc</li>
    <li> I love the oils. There very therapeutic and calming. I use these as homeopathic cures in many instances. I&#x27;ve purchased my mom a full line. She swears peppermint oil keeps spiders at bay.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of organix brand tea tree and mint shampoo and conditioner, however I don&#x27;t like the way the brand makes my hair feel so I ordered the peppermint and tea tree essential oils to add to my regular brand of shampoo and conditioner, dove intensive repair, and now it smells exactly like the organix brand. I also used a few drops in my lea e in conditioner and now I smell like a giant thin mint. Yay!</li>
    <li> I received my oil exactly on time, exceeded my expectations! The product was wrapped with bubble wrap and in perfect condition. I was very pleased with my purchase. I plan to use it with Rosemary oil and coconut oil for a scalp rub and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Best essential oils out there.</li>
    <li> I use to use tea tree oil before to help reduce acne.  I was happy that Amazon carried tea tree oil.  I used this on my pimple for 2 days, and it has really helped die it down.  For me, tea tree oil works the best for pimples.</li>
    <li> i use this for infections for minor cuts</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil to help with acne and it works great for cleansing and soothing the scalp when washing hair. I add a few drops to my toner or apply it directly to troubled acne spots. Also works well for cuts and burns. Great product and many natural uses.</li>
    <li> Quality oil for great price!</li>
    <li> Do not spread this around your face because it can make you breakout! that&#x27;s the only negative thing about this product. I bought this for spot treatment on my acne and it works OK. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. In my experience, its best use to calm down an inflamed or swollen popped pimple almost instantly, but it only works sometimes. I would probably buy this again if needed.</li>
    <li> i use this for everything antiseptic, ear infections, aromatherapy. I just cant get enough of tea tree oil. thank you</li>
    <li> I received the tea tree oil and placed a few drops in my shea butter mix and oil mix that I used for my scalp. It&#x27;s helping with my itchy scalp. I&#x27;ve tried other tea tree oil products, but all of them either had petroleum or other ingredients in it, which made the tea tree not so potent. I wish I had tried this a long time ago.  FYI: I have 3c/4a natural hair.</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil is great for skin problems and it&#x27;s a holistic too!</li>
    <li> Highly Recommended! Service and shipping was fast! I would definitely buy from Edens Garden again!</li>
    <li> So far I am happy with the Edens Garden line. I have a few different EO&#x27;s and like them all.</li>
    <li> great product, use daily</li>
    <li> Item was delivered fast, exactly as described</li>
    <li> I ordered a 10ml bottle of tea tree oil and I love it. I use it as part of my homemade hair rinse and to treat dandruff on occasion. Smells and works great! Product arrived in a timely manner and shipped safely to prevent the bottle from breaking.</li>
    <li> I have ordered from Eden&#x27;s Garden three times, and all three times they have messed up my order. The oils are good, maybe not quite as good as the really high cost stuff, but good enough for the price. Unfortunately whomever fulfills the orders does an absolutely terrible job... each time we&#x27;ve ordered quite a few, and every time we&#x27;ve received the wrong ones. The first two times they ended up shipping us the ones that we were missing. Well, the last time I ordered, I filed the same missing product report, and nothing ever received. Even if a replacement was received the last time around, it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to fulfill an order properly, the first time around. It really bothers me when a customer is treated this way. Word of warning to those looking to purchase from this seller!</li>
    <li> I bought the Tea Tree oil because I got my belly pierced a few months back. My friend recommended that this tea tree oil will really help heal it up. For some reason my piercing was a little irritated and would have a little puss. I received the product very fast. It is a bit strong but i put it on every night before bed. It doesn&#x27;t stain my cloths either witch I love! I love how the bottle tells you what it was usually used for it said it was used for healing/ cleaning cuts and infections. After I bought it a few weeks later my sister who got dermal piercings, one of her piercing then started to get irritated and I then cleaned hers with saltwater and then applied the tea tree oil twice a day. The next day it went back to normal. I would defiantly use this product and this seller. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I have been aware of tea tree oil for some time now and have used it in the past for minor skin irritations as well as for healthy nails. More recently I read that tea tree oil could be useful for moles and skin tags so I decided to try it. I have had a mole on my forehead for years and thought I&#x27;d like to remove it but didn&#x27;t want to have surgery or use the more powerful topical choices that are supposed to remove moles in a matter of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tea tree oil takes longer but is natural and less likely to leave scarring. After using the tea tree oil for a couple of months I have noticed the color of the mole has become lighter and the size has decreased. It requires patience and dedicated use but I am noticing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this seller as they provide a variety of 100% pure essential oils properly packaged in amber bottles to keep light from affecting purity. Their prices are excellent in comparison to other sellers and shipping is fast and consistent. If you want to try one of the many uses for tea tree oil I recommend this seller.[[ASIN:B002RSILIG Tea Tree 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil- 30 ml]]</li>
    <li> I looked all over for 100% pure essential oil and found a great product here.  It is very reasonably priced (about the best I found).  I plan on using it in my homemade cleaning supplies and even deodorant!  Excited that I found this brand that is good and easy accessible.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle but a little goes a long way! I love the clean smell of it too. I use it to clean my piercings and nothing works better than this.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality tea tree/melalucca oil.  My kids don&#x27;t like thesmell, but it isn&#x27;t bad, just distinctly melalucca oil smell.  Excellent for acne and/or eczema.  Other uses, too, but that is what WE use it for.  Also, tasted terrible when I did this, but I was desperate and didn&#x27;t have any clove oil, so I put just a drop of tea tree oil on the roof of my mouth the other day when I badly burned my mouth on hot pizza.  The pain was too bad, and the whole roof was blistered, so I gave tea tree oil a try by applying a drop to my finger and gently spreading it on the roof of my mouth.  Still hurt, but next morning burn was almost entirely gone, when usually a burn like that takes a week or more to heal.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as others I have tried.</li>
    <li> It does all it saids it does.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> We purchased this after our oldest daughter got head lice.  I mixed this into everything that I could to help prevent future outbreaks.  I need to order more.</li>
    <li> This was one of my first purchases with essential oils and I love it. I have had a flea problem in my home, leaving me with lots of bug bites on my feet. This oil not only helped clean the bites but soothed and cooled them. I also found a ton of other uses for this including cleansing my pores. This is a great price and so effective. I will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of tea tree oil until I got a suspected &amp;#34;keloid&amp;#34; on my nose piercing. These are often times common for nose piercings as well as cartilage piercings. At first I googled how to get rid of this bump, and I came across solutions to buy at the piercing parlor, though I didn&#x27;t want to spend $20 on a spray. So I mixed sea salt and warm water, and that helped reduce the redness a bit, but not so much with resolving the size. So I googled some more and found that many people use tea tree oil. Now, the smell isn&#x27;t the best, but if you aren&#x27;t super sensitive to smell, it should be fine. This is toxic to humans and animals, so I advise you keep it away from pets and children. I started applying this oil to the bump on my nose twice a day, and after 5 days, the bump was nearly gone. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I used the sea salt mixture for 2 or 3 weeks and barely got any results, and this tea tree oil got rid of my bump within a week. I was super amazed and happy. There are other uses for this oil, though this was my reason for purchasing it. My friend also had a keloid on her nose piercing and hers went away in about the same time. Highly recommend for any piercing keloids!</li>
    <li> Always high quality. Prices are beyond fair. Use the tea tree oil in oily skin soap and the peppermint in foot lotion. A little goes a LONG WAY.</li>
    <li> Really love this brand of oils. Just started getting into essential oils, but the info  they send with their products are very helpful.</li>
    <li> Works great on red ant bites</li>
    <li> This is REAL Tea tree oil. I have purchased &amp;#34;Tea Tree&amp;#34; oil and been very disappointed in the quality. I used to buy this oil from a  company and this is EXACTLY the same. The difference is that this is a FRACTION of the cost. It makes me want to buy MORE of their products! It came with a brochure of their products and I feel good about buying from them. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I was just at my favorite Health Food Store. They are running it through a diffuser.</li>
    <li> Worked as I expected it too, and was the perfect size, not to big and not to small either. Glad I purchased it</li>
    <li> I like the product , but it did not last it comes in a very small container.</li>
    <li> This stuff has a really really strong smell but seems to work great. I got my tragus pierced a month ago but it has still been swollen and irritated, so I put this stuff on it and literally the next morning my swelling was gone and has been since. I used it on a few stubborn pimples but no results yet. Something else to be noted, someone else on here mentioned that it is really toxic to animals so please keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but still love it. Will order again.</li>
    <li> LOVE i use this stuff all the time in so many different things from cleaning to bug bites!</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend for the price and it works good. smells fragrant and has lasted me a long time. no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I use Tree Tea Oil on myself &amp; my dogs.  I put it on their paws &amp; they don,t like the taste so they won&amp;#34;t lick it off...It heals naturally &amp; is antiseptic as well.  Have used this product for years w/ excellent results on cuts, scratches &amp; scrapes.  The price was right &amp; I saved on gas &amp; time ordering on line.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a treatment for ingrown hair and kept seeing tea tree oil as a treatment vut i believe that this particular type is more for aromatherapy use, although im not quite sure. I however used it topically on my skin and used olive oil as a carrier oil to blend it with and applied it to the areas i was having problems with and even used it on my toenails because i had read about people using it to treat a nail fungus and although i didnt have that problem i had very weak and brittle nails and they just ovsrall did not look the way i felt a healthy nail would. Beliebe it or not, some time aftee applying it i was able to see the ingrown hairs coms roto the surface enough to either remove or gently work out and after only two nights of applyibg it to my toes they were significantly stronger than they were before i had applied the oil. I still use tea tree oil although i bought a different brand after this one but even if it actually intended for aromatherapy, when i used it on my skin i still saw improvement. Beware, the smell is a little strong and depending on whaf you plan on using it for you will most likely have to dilute it. Great natural oil though and it is a natural way to treat bacteria on the skin.</li>
    <li> First off, very satisfied with the seller as the product came swiftly, and well packaged in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews about how strong the smell of the oil was, and.. they weren&#x27;t exaggerating. However, it is not all bad as the smell does dissipate as the oil is absorbed. Personally, I don&#x27;t mind it. I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks for pimples and so far I&#x27;ve gotten positive results. Don&#x27;t let the warnings about the smell scare you off!</li>
    <li> This oil is much runnier than other oils that I&#x27;ve tried.  My only assumption is that these oils are more diluted.  So yes, while they are all natural and therapeutic grade, they have &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; of the powerful oil and more water.</li>
    <li> great oil but smell might be strong but i use it at night and it works its wonders</li>
    <li> I am someone who cannot stand the sight of a blemish, and can&#x27;t stop myself from picking it right away and causing it to inflame even more. This particular tea tree oil is pure, and works wonders. I poured several drops into my Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel toner, and give it a good shake before every use (since the oil is hydrophobic), and it is keeping my skin blemish-free. I also use a little drop with a Q-tip for spot treatment if needed, and any eruptions are gone over-night. I am dealing with exam stress at the moment, and this is keeping my skin clear, so thank God for that! Shipping was a little slow for me, but I can&#x27;t complain...this is just too good!</li>
    <li> Love this Tea Tree/Melaleuca oil. I use this oil in home-made cleaning supplies, insect sprays/deterrent, facial cleansing, laundry, diffusing, the list goes on and on. I feel this oil compares side by side to many other brands. I like the access to Eden&#x27;s Garden products and the great pricing, without negotiating the MLM companies. Tea Tree is a staple in our home as it has such plethora of usages. Would definitely recommend to a friend and will purchase again as needed.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell, greasy and really I had no purpose for it .. This is the worst and most ineffective tree oil</li>
    <li> This has helped my skin more than a lot of other things I&#x27;ve used. The smell isn&#x27;t so bad after a while, though it takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for dry and cracked heels.  I use it for many different ailments.</li>
    <li> Great for cuts and fungus</li>
    <li> I bought this for my drandruff doesnt seem to be working for my certain problem.  But it came fast and intact with a little pamphlet,  would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> So many uses for this for mold and other things will come in handy when I need it good product</li>
    <li> This oil is potent and great for diffusing when you need to clear the air. We use it for homemade deodorant as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product line. Always quick to arrive. Great customer service. The scents are nice and my clients love them.</li>
    <li> It cleared up my acne slightly but the smell is just awful. I honestly felt like I was getting high off of it. I was sitting there drinking water to be able to breathe lol. Since I usually have a stuffed up nose though, it fixed that as well. Great product!</li>
    <li> My new favorite Therapeutic oil Co. Edens Garden.</li>
    <li> It was not as effective as described for fighting fungi. I recommend trying Thyme oil. Also the product might not be 100% undiluted. It did come in time and with a nice pamphlet though!</li>
    <li> HELPS CURE NAIL FUNGUS</li>
    <li> This is good and strong, and can be used in many concoctions. Great for adding to shampoo. Strong pure Tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Great Product, good price.</li>
    <li> Really good in soaps for acne!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the quality of tea tree oil, especially for the price compared to other essential oil companies. The bottle quickly shipped to me in great condition - it was packaged well and not broken. This tea tree is great for skin care (just always make sure to dilute it as it is strong) and it really helps to keep my face clear as it is very antibacterial. Do beware that tea tree does have a strong distinct smell. If you don&#x27;t like strong smells then you may want to find a different essential oil.</li>
    <li> good deal decent price small bottle but more than you think all you will need most don&#x27;t use much because of strength of smell</li>
    <li> I AM ENJOYING THIS PRODUCT.  GOOD FOR FUNGUS AND HEALING.</li>
    <li> Works like tea tree, smells like tree...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your postage purchasing the smaller bottles because it&#x27;ll run out and you&#x27;ll be reordering. This is a wonderful, medicinal smelling oil; plus, it works in healing infected skin areas.</li>
    <li> Aways Love tea tree oil</li>
    <li> I have a dry spot on my elbow. I didn&#x27;t see where it helped, but nothing seems to work. You have to get use to the smell, which isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> This product is much more expensive through most other online retailers. It was a good value and very effective. Well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> works as expected - but i really like this brand. less of a fuss with advertising and more of a simple focus on quality. i have never been disappointed with any of eden&#x27;s garden oils!</li>
    <li> tee Treee Oil is a hosehold must have. i use it for cuts, sores athletes foot ( as recommended by my foot Dr). Don&#x27;t know why i didn&#x27;t start using it 20 yrs ago!</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. The smell reminds me of eucalyptus, it is earthy and woodsy too. I have been mixing this with coconut oil and putting on my skin. very nice.</li>
    <li> I used this for my acne, used different stuff and even saw 3 doctors for my skin, spent couple of hundreds dollars for my face problem. Finally got this product because one of my patients recommend it. After I bought this, I used it quick, so my friend bought me a bigger size. Now my face is so clean and smooth, I gave mine to a friend, she is using it and she felt better for her face now...</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil in many ways.  This product is of very high quality for any use from hot baths to dandruff!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> good product &amp; a very good price also  This is a very good product to have on hand for a variety of reasons</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the results that came from direct application on itchy patches on my scalp. I keep it on my nightstand.</li>
    <li> Works wonders, highly recommend this product. used it as suggested on cuts, burns, scrapes and by a day or two, HEALED!</li>
    <li> The smell was rather abrasive when I first smelt it, but i have gotten used to it and have actually grown quite fond of it. I use it on my skin and it works wonders. I am obsessed with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Why pay more? I used to buy from Doterra, but this oil is every bit as good for a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> Lovely smell! We purchased this essential oil (among others) for DIY sprays and oil diffuser.</li>
    <li> It seems like a great product so far and much like the more expensive ones purchased from marketing networks. Try it.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because not only have I been a fan of Tea Tree Oil for many years, I felt that this is a good quality product. The catalog that was sent with my order included LOTS of helpful information about the uses of other essential oils and other helpful information. The reason I buy tea tree oil is to clear up breakouts on my face, and within 2 to 3 days I can see a drastic difference and this product did just as I had hoped it would. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for use as an anti bacterial.  Works great!!!  I tried it on a spot of psoriosis, twice a day for a week and it completely cleared up the spot.  I will use this product again and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had this stubborn spot on my scalp that would shed skin. It might have been eczema. I rubbed this in for a few days and it&#x27;s gone. Love it!</li>
    <li> i bought this because a bunch of recipesi have found for homemade baby wipes call for tree tea oil and im not sure if its just my sons bumm or what but it is leaving a rash so i had to dis continue use of it. plus its hard to measure how much is coming out.</li>
    <li> I started using this in a last ditch effort to clear up some thumbnail fungus I have been battling for seven years.  After two weeks it appeared to be making a difference so I stopped using the cocktail of other expensive and ineffective remedies.  It has almost completely cleared up the problem after five weeks.  I was at the point of using internal medicines that event the doctors are leery of using (because the medicines have really bad side effects).  The tea tree oil did the job without negative side effects.  I am buying more to use on a toe fungus next, and for any infections in the future.  I originally read about this as a recommendation on WebMD or I would have dismissed it as something of an urban legend, but I am really pleased with the results.  This stuff is a strong toxin and should not be taken internally (spit it out if using in your mouth) - so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend its use on small children.  It is interesting reading what other people are using it on.  I wish I had heard about it when I was young (I am in my sixties and acne is not a concern at my age..).  It should work on any infections from what I&#x27;ve read, so I&#x27;ll keep some around.</li>
    <li> Very strong smell but it works</li>
    <li> I use it in face masks and face wash to better clean my pores.</li>
    <li> I heard that Tea Tree oil was good for atheletes foot. It seems to be working, but not as quickly as I had read it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is really strong.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. a little goes long way. I mix it with other oils. very strong. the real deal. will and have purchased many times from this brand.</li>
    <li> I got this to heal my keliod on my cartilage piercing. However, I never kept my routine so it didn&#x27;t work for me. It does smell pretty strong though. But it&#x27;s not unbearable.</li>
    <li> So happy when I got it.</li>
    <li> It got rid of my keloid on my nose piercing AND it&#x27;s a great acne reducer. I am so glad I found this. It arrived very quickly as well.</li>
    <li> Great addition to my homemade scalp moisturizing recipe! Flake-free these days now</li>
    <li> Love Eden&#x27;s Garden Products!!! Great prices and product!</li>
    <li> I use this as health oil but also in homemade products especially homemade soaps of various kinds. Product as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this product because you can use it for many different uses. From acne, dry skin, to bug bites. Smell is a bit strong but it is something you can get used to.</li>
    <li> Very natural product that is good to use for the skin. It works for what it is intended to work for.Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I use this in my DIY Whipped Shea Butter  for my natural hair.  This product is really good to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help maintain my acne and redness after I read so many great reviews. I was using it for a month and I hadn&#x27;t noticed any huge change with my face but it wasn&#x27;t getting any worse so I was happy with that. I&#x27;ve started using it for other purposes and I find it works great for razor burn. Although I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my face, I still enjoy the product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> We use this Tea Tree oil to sooth nerve damaged itchy skin. It is a relief that helps heal. Shipped fast arrived safe</li>
    <li> The only thing I can say about this product ,it is real pure essential oil. Also i liked the paper with some recipes for home and personal using.</li>
    <li> It works awesome for athletes foot. It has a strong smell but it is good. I definatly recommend it for atheletes foot.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of some oils but there&#x27;s one that&#x27;s got a first place in my heart. Tea tree oil is one that has gotten me out of some potential bad situation s because of its desinfecting powers. This is the real thing, I&#x27;d be able to tell otherwise.</li>
    <li> Love it this stops the bug itch</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are equal to doTerra, or Young Living. For most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that Edens Garden is not as good. Edens Garden in my opinion is the best in quality and purity for the price.</li>
    <li> Lasts for a long time and the quality is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I use this in my diffuser with lavender oil and it works wonders helping me breath at night.</li>
    <li> I use this tea tree oil often, it is my go to oil for cuts, scratches, blisters, bug bites, and cold sores. If I&#x27;m using it on a sensitive area I dilute it in some lotion, if not it goes on straight. Works like a miracle, much faster relief and  healing than any over the counter remedies I&#x27;ve ever used. Have been a faithful user of tea tree oil for about 15 years. Have been using Eden&#x27;s garden for over a year now and very happy with all of their oils, especially love their blends.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of essential oils out there and some are VERY pricy.  This company makes a wonderful high quality product and their selection of other oils is amazing</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This has worked wonders on my skin. I apply it to clean skin, concentrating on problem areas. I then use pure vitamin e oil as moisturizer. I definitely recommend this to anyone who has issues with clogged pores or acne scars.</li>
    <li> I use this in homemade hair concoctions and love it. I am not a huge fan of the scent of tea tree oil so i mix it with either my grapefruit or orange oil to help with that.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I got this to pair with face toner for acne and it actually works great!  If you can stand the strong smell, it really does help to disinfect acne problems.  I brought this with me on a plane trip, and since I only brought carry on, I wanted tiny bottles of stuff....so this was my only acne medicine.  My grandma complained about the smell....but my face improved by the end of the week!</li>
    <li> good product . I got instructions on how to use it and it was in nice packaging. But the smell isn&#x27;t all that great . i didnt know it was gonna smell like that . it smells like a mans bad cologne</li>
    <li> This goes a long way for its size. Its a great natural antibiotic, antifungal that is safe to use on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love having tea tree oil on hand for it&#x27;s several uses. This bottle is the perfect size for my needs.</li>
    <li> After having cold sores on my chin for YEARS and being disappointed with dermatologists not knowing how to help, I tried Tea Tree Oil. Within a couple of hours, the sore was down by 50%. After regular use, my husband said my chin hasn&#x27;t looked so good in years. I am loving Edens Garden&#x27;s oils. I bought both cheaper as well popular expensive essential oils and keep going back to Edens Garden. The price is great and quality is amazing.</li>
    <li> Good quality and has many uses</li>
    <li> Product very versatile and effective.  Can use on cuts &amp; sores; very effective astringent.  I also use to help drain my sinuses by dabbing a tiny bit at the end of my nose....</li>
    <li> I purchased this originally as an ingredient in my concoction for combating my mosquito and biting fly problem. YES! In combination with the other essential oils I purchased, the medium, and a simple diffuser, my patio is mosquito and biting fly free and I am back to being able to use it. This product arrived quickly and smelled really good (no idea what tea tree is supposed to smell like!). It is strong, and I blended it with the other essential oils and my medium and placed it in a diffuser. This company combines shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have psoriatic arthritis and there is little that actually helps except opiate medications. I was looking online for essential oils to blend for my mosquito problem and decided that I should give this a try for my joints. Back to google! I found a number of useful &amp;#34;hints&amp;#34; and some not so useful, like &amp;#34;buy my product,&amp;#34; not useful. Once I had a good-sized list of a few oils to blend together, back to amazon for the purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later, I was desperate for pain relief, and I grabbed the diffuser. I poured some directly onto my knees and legs and rubbed. I went to bed. When I woke up in the morning, for the first time in 4 months I woke up without any pain at all in my legs and hips. No meds!</li>
    <li> I bought this because a lot of people said that it helps heal infections. I have a nose piercing infection and used peroxide. But \\&quot;tea tree oil really works.\\&quot; I got it on time and it came with a book. If I hadn&#x27;t read the book and other reviews I wouldn&#x27;t have know that I had to delute the oil with water. It smells really bad, but that&#x27;s not my complaint. I used it every day in the morning and by my fourth time using it my infection became more red then it was when I starting using the oil. I had two people ask me if it was bleeding in and hour and then my mom asked me where I got the scab from. However, it did make the infection go down a little by the second time I used it. I won&#x27;t buy anymore tea tree oil for infections, I will stick to peroxide. I have not used it on acne.</li>
    <li> This product provides deep cleansing for faster and safer healing.  A drop on cotton clears blemishes and impurities safely and quickly.</li>
    <li> AMAZING.  I literally use this product for everything--&amp;#62; acne, cuts, itchy scalp, nail treatment, you name it I use it for.  And it does an amazing job.  For acne it&#x27;s truly incredible, as someone who used to use acne washes and products that would simply dry my skin out which would then cause me to become more oily this product dries the affect area (overnight) and does not make my skin super dry and nasty.  If your skin does that after using this product I would say use a moisturizer with it.  I like to use coconut oil.  It&#x27;s light and very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptic getting this but it works miracles. I have random terrible breakouts on my forehead this cleared it right up in a little over a week. It was incredible.</li>
    <li> Very very strong smell.  Not sure I like it and not sure it&#x27;s giving me the results I was hoping for.  I am a strong believer in oil, so I haven&#x27;t given up yet.  If I see results that are impressive I&amp;#34;ll come back and write another review.  I wish this had more of a dropper top like I was expecting.  It&#x27;s nothing that you can squeeze, but they call it a dropper.  You just lift it out and hope it drops where you want it I guess.</li>
    <li> Great on cuts and also great after shaving.</li>
    <li> I have to say right off this is a very strong smelling oil but one that seems to be packed with good outcomes. I have had a fungus on my one nail for a while now, everything I have tried did not kill it until I tried Tea Tree Oil. I used some every night, not a lot because of the strong smell, but enough and after a few weeks the fungus was gone. What a relief. This is good for many things but again it is very strong, at least to me it is so use with caution if you have sensitivity to smells as I do. Other than that a very useful product that I received for a honest review.</li>
    <li> Has helped clear up serious skin allergies on my dog</li>
    <li> It smells nice and I have used it a couple times. Nice packaging, well protected. So far so good. I got five different oils. They are all good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item along with other essential oils for my natural hair care.  I mixed this along with other oils like Rosemary and Peppermint along with megatek and M-T-G and it soothes the scalp! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I would buy again. Tea Tree is a fantastic oil.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this product and received it a few days ago. I have heard great things about the healing and anti bacterial properties so I was excited to try it out. I can&#x27;t even tell you if it worked after the first use because I just cannot get over the smell. Man it is SO STRONG. it really just is not a pleasant smell and it is extremely potent. I am going to try diluting it with water and then applying. As I am putting this on at night, I don&#x27;t want the smell seeping into my pillows and other bedding. If you are sensitive to strong odors, don&#x27;t even think about buying this.</li>
    <li> This is my first review of anything on Amazon. I purchased this after getting into oils and all things natural. Also after reading many reviews. I must admit I suffer from dandruff A LOT and needed something to soothe my dry itchy scalp. Once I used this with honey and apple cider vinegar it was wonderful. My scalp began to tingle , man o man I thought I had lost my mind. It was so soothing and relaxing but I really dont like the smell. I can get over that though.</li>
    <li> I just received my tea tree oil and I&#x27;m very impressed already!  My oil was well protected in its wrapping. It also came with a book of other essential oils and their uses. I&#x27;m really excited to try their other oils. I do wish there was a specific warning regarding the tea tree oil and children.</li>
    <li> Well it was ok it has a smell I ran out of it fast. I will buy more</li>
    <li> This worked really well in my face wash that I made. I LOVE Eden&#x27;s Garden!!! Their prices are way better than other companies I have researched. I Love the website too. I Love what the company stands for . Thank You Edens Garden</li>
    <li> I use this for acne when something is creeping up after a stressful week at work...always seems to do the trick.  From the other reviews it seems to have a ton of other uses but I simply haven&#x27;t explored them just yet.</li>
    <li> Having a hard time with the scent. Reminds me of pinesol which I don&#x27;t like so b/c of that I don&#x27;t know if it would help with what I need it for like my nails, hair and vapor for oils.</li>
    <li> It is not the miracle cure I had expected it to be, and you smell like a varished piece of furniture after applying it.</li>
    <li> This was my last hope on combating my acne. I thought I&#x27;d try this before heading to the dermatologist for Accutane. I broke out horribly on my cheek, 10 pimples all clustered in the same area. Never have I been more embarrassed. :-( They were the most painful I have ever experienced. I decided to apply 1 drop (yes, 1 drop) of TTO w/ 5 drops of jojoba oil, and applied it on my face at night after cleansing. After 2-3 days all of my 10+ bumps had subsided. My breakouts became less painful and my skin is so smooth. I cannot believe it. I also apply 2 drops w/ jojoba oil &amp; moisturizer on my back since I have acne there as well. My back has never looked better!!! After trying countless products, my miracle was there the whole time. Please, please do not hesitate to try this stuff. I have high hopes for this in the long-run!</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that controls my cystic acne. Will definitely be purchasing again. I was on monocycline and clindamycin for months... and now I just use this oil before I go to bed. Highly recommend for those with acne issues.</li>
    <li> Can;&#x27;t get enough of the melaleuca&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> So many uses and it works and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I got this for my nose ring because it had scaring around it and everyone on YouTube said to use tea tree oil. So I bought this an applied it to my nose and the scaring went away. I hated the smell, but it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
    <li> This stuffs great will kill any common wart.</li>
    <li> I love it. I put it on my skin at night and my breakouts have cleared in a day or 2. My skin has been pretty bad lately and I even had a &amp;#34;cystic&amp;#34; pimple that I put it on and it was completely gone in less than 3 days! I&#x27;ve made a custom Coconut Oil face lotion which I added this (among others) to and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I use this 100% for break outs. It takes my hard(never surface) zits. The one&#x27;s that just come up on your chin or something and just hurt and are hard, but nothing ever comes to head. I use them for any break outs, but mainly for these type of pimples. It helps very much in getting theses suckers down! I for sure recommend a more natural way to treat pimples. This works! It really does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used tea tree oil many times before and this doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong or effective to past brands I&#x27;ve purchased. With others when using for acne a pimple would be significantly smaller after one use, with this it takes several day. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This works well.  I use this to put on blemishes and acne and to heal it very quick.  Normally an infected blemish will clear in a day with this!</li>
    <li> I love it. This is perfect. Now I know where to get my oils from.</li>
    <li> My husband has been dealing with a skin disorder for years, causing extreme pruritus.  My sister in law recommended Tea Tree oil as she had used it successfully and faithfully to treat a nail fungus.  We tried applying the oil topically to the irritated areas and the irritation is gone.</li>
    <li> This is a must have e o.  I love it and use it for many things.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for breakouts. I also sensed a yeast infection from an antibiotic I was taking and I cleansed with this oil and the itch went away.</li>
    <li> I lie it for my scalp itchies, but it did nothing for my acne. Even though I diluted it heavily it made a patch of my skin turn leathery and peel off. Probably not the sellers fault, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Arrived on time. Exactly as listed. Very happy with this purchase and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great tea tree oil!  Came right on time, no problems!  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Make sure you have this one in your medicine cabinet! Works wonders for a natural bacteria cleanser. Very good price!</li>
    <li> Love Eden&#x27;s Garden products!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to treat acne. I put just a small amount on my blemishes at night and in the morning after washing my face and there is a noticeable decrease in the inflammation the same day!</li>
    <li> This works well but it stinks.  I need to use it for a rash around my mouth.  While it does clear it up, it tastes terrible if you accidentally touch on it</li>
    <li> This is a very good price! They shipped same day which was awesome because I needed it to clear up nail fungus and tea tree oil is the best thing for that!</li>
    <li> not doing anything for me</li>
    <li> I used this on my acne while pregnant and didn&#x27;t see much of a change.  I think it did help a bit to dry out the acne but didn&#x27;t get rid of it completely.</li>
    <li> Just adding my opinion of five happy stars for this well-priced and effective tea tree oil.  I knew a bit about this essential oil, and so decided to get some along with some others (Good Night and Four Thieves blends) as part of learning about essential oils and their health benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this already, topically, as recommended and can say it is an amazing antiseptic and has definite healing effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan of essential oils now, for sure, and I love that Edens Garden makes them affordable while maintain the best quality.  Price had been a factor in me not trying such products, but Edens has make it possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this in a blend for scarring and I also use it as a face wash. Haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I&#x27;ve switched to natural products. This is great for pimples and black heads.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product for small breakouts on the face and has good healing properties for cuts. I&#x27;m loving it. A little bit goes a long way</li>
    <li> I am going to purchase the double pack next time. This is an oil I use multiple times a day. I especially love to put a couple drops in a shot of water and use it as a mouth rinse instead of harsh chemical mouth washes.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product. Will Buy again.</li>
    <li> I actually love this particular essential oil but could only give it four stars because I love a few others more such as lavender and peppermint, but still this is very nice. It is one you have to develop a taste for as it&#x27;s so unusual and does smell like medicine somehow.&lt;br /&gt;I mix this one with a few drops of basil and lemon and it is beautiful in a very exotic woodsy way. This is calming and healing. It&#x27;s a turpentine scent to my nose which I happen to love. It&#x27;s the deep dark forest after a rainstorm. It smells lovely but as I say it&#x27;s one you need to learn to appreciate.</li>
    <li> tea tree oil works wonders! I had many breakouts and they all virtually disappeared within days. It feels soothing on my skin and is very easy to use. Put it in your cart RIGHT NOW</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. It has a strong sent though. The best thing about this product is it&#x27;s advertising for their other products, they send a booklet advertising their other debts they had. I found it funny.</li>
    <li> Normally I use NOW oils, but this price jumped out so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I use tea tree for thousands of things, but mostly as part of my hair rinse. I don&#x27;t know what it is about this oil that would make it any different, but it strips my hair making it feel dry and gross and the scent is more subtle than I&#x27;m used to. I give 4 stars because it still serves it&#x27;s purpose for other things but its just not the same.</li>
    <li> Very strong but I think it is much better than using acne medications. Doesn&#x27;t dry my sensitive skin up and isn&#x27;t harsh.</li>
    <li> Thank you! Perfect! I like it!</li>
    <li> I have dropped my bottles on tile floor many, many times and it has not even cracked! It&#x27;s a little difficult to get the oil out, but that&#x27;s just the nature of such products. It isn&#x27;t too harsh for my skin either. This is my go-to product now.</li>
    <li> My acne seems to improved while using this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this for my blemishes and pimples.so far working,happy with the results.(its not going to happen over night) better than any other product i have tried.but the only thing is the smell can be over welming. i put it on an hour or two before bedtime. i do feel a tingling feeling, knowing its working to get rid of the toxins on my face.i def will buy more!!</li>
    <li> This oil has a very strong smell. I mix a few drops with my black Jamaican castor oil to apply on my scalp and hair. Seems to be of a good quality.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is probably one of the best things for preventing staff infection. Put a couple drops in warm water and wash the area and takes care of infections.</li>
    <li> Love using it as a deterrent for mosquitoes.</li>
    <li> Good value.  Good product.  I have bought several other oils from this brand and they are all good.</li>
    <li> They sent the wrong oil, not tea tree oil, they sent fir needle&amp;#60; I was very disappointed,  But I used what they sent as a room defuser  for the Holidays so it all turned out good. But I was sad , I really needed tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> High potency-High quality astringent I use it to tighten pores open sinus and on little skin ailments, strong love the little burn.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. I use it for my back acne and it actually help.&lt;br /&gt;My back continues to have less acne and dark spot.</li>
    <li> I have to research this oil usage again, because I really haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Tea Tree oil and Eucalyptus oil of the same brand to make my own cloth wipe solution. I gave it a 5 star because it smells great, it has been useful and functional as far as I can tell. I cannot say for the quality as I don&#x27;t have any way to test its quality or if it truly is &amp;#34;pure.&amp;#34;  Tea tree oil is supposed to have anti-fungal properties, so that is why I bought it. Before I bought this, I was just mixing water with coconut oil and baby soap for my solution and within 24 hours of it sitting in the wipe warmer, it started to smell like mildew. I was so frustrated, so I wanted to try an Tea Tree oil. Mixing with water and baby soap for the cloth wipe solution and the last 3 batches have been great. It smells great, and so far no smell of mildew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised of the tea tree oil smell, did not know what to expect, as this was my first time ever using tea tree oil. I think it reminds me a bit of menthol rubs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I was a bit disappointed by, but not enough to lower to a 4 star, is the dropper. I was hoping it was those squeeze pipette style dropper, but it is not. It&#x27;s not their fault, it was my misunderstanding of what &amp;#34;euro style dropper cap&amp;#34; meant. I&#x27;ve attached a picture. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this style is that you have to &amp;#34;shake&amp;#34; the bottle to get a drop in, and thus, it is not an accurate measurement. I only want to put 2 drops per solution batch, but often I get more than that. Not a huge deal, and also it seems like every essential oil comes with this type anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great, and I think it will last me a while, but once I&#x27;m done with it, will certainly be ordering another!</li>
    <li> I must need more practice</li>
    <li> Trying to figure out other ways to use it</li>
    <li> The price was amazing. It met my expectations. I would recommend this product to any one who is into essential oils, Thank you.</li>
    <li> works wonderful as a preshave oil. smells great</li>
    <li> I love these oils. I order different ones all the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my scalp. I have a problem with itching and dandruff. It worked great. Plus the little spout made it easy applying directly to my scalp. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it spilling.</li>
    <li> The tea tree oil is great. It works well for acne, and I like the smell. My only complaint is the bottle; the dropper is on the inside of the bottle, and it&#x27;s hard to control how much oil comes out at once. Sometimes I flip the bottle over and three drops come out, other times I get nothing.</li>
    <li> Works on lots of things naturally - I like that. Get some for whatever you are thinking you need it for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it! Smell so bed! But I know it smell just like this! So.....&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use it too along!</li>
    <li> I like being able to smell lots of different smells at a fairly affordable price.  If you have pets you should be careful using these oils around them.  I try to use them when my cat is not around. I like Eden&#x27;s garden products and intend to build up a collection of them.</li>
    <li> Bought two bottles of Tea Tree to apply to a huge skin tag that was on the side of my neck. Applied it every day for about two months. The skin tag dried up and I itched it off. Also put it on a few other small skin tags that I had. Same results. Still have half of the first bottle I opened. I was looking at wart removing stuff that cost $50+ with iffy reviews. This Tea Tree is cheap and it works.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that it had any beneficial value.</li>
    <li> Smells good and I have been using it to heal small cuts and my son uses it for acne. It works great and has so many uses, this is a no-brainer to have around the house.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 2 pack of this item under advice from my sister in law. I did some research on tea tree oil at seriouslynatural.com, and this is what the author has to say about it: \\&quot;Tea tree oil is particularly effective against fungus, bacteria and viruses and can help with many ailments from sore throats to acne to toenail fungus.  The uses of this oil are vast but please note it&#x27;s not for human consumption.\\&quot; With that in mind, I purchased this product and put 5 drops in my husband&#x27;s hair while washing it last night. Not only did it make his hair tingle more than usual, but it also cleared out the dandruff! Really impressed with this product. Will be trying 5 drops in my shampoo when I wash my hair tonight. :o)</li>
    <li> Did exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Tea tree smells to botanical for me, I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as strong, but certainly it isn&#x27;t to pleasant to smell for long.</li>
    <li> I bought this to freshen up my daughter&#x27;s diaper pail. She&#x27;s breast feed and not on solids yet, but that doesn&#x27;t mean her diaper pail (a $7 IKEA can)  can smell kind of funky after a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tea tree oil has a nice, clean aroma that lasts. I drop a couple drops in the new trashbag and it works to ward off the stink (I&#x27;ll update this too once she starts eating solids and her poo&#x27;s get a little worse lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I&#x27;m super happy at is.... IT KEEPS ANTS AWAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not normally a homeopathic bug killer kind of person. I grew up with Raid in my household. But with a little one around, I&#x27;m way more apprehensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in a house that the bug guy told us ants like coming up through the foundation and there&#x27;s nothing that we can do about it other than put out traps. It was driving me nuts because they were in my kitchen. I&#x27;m not a neat freak by any stretch, but I like my kitchen clean and bug-free, because EWW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read online that tea tree oil can ward off ants, so I loaded up a cotton ball with it and rubbed it all over where I saw the ants, and THEY WENT AWAY. I soaked a few more cotton balls and put them in strategic places to keep the scent. I&#x27;d rather have random cotton balls than bug traps any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there&#x27;s a gazillion more uses for this stuff, but these two reasons work for me!</li>
    <li> I love Eden&#x27;s Garden. This oil is perfect for skin issues. Has great healing properties. I use it on my piercings whenever they get irritated, inflamed, or even infected. I also use it for acne, and psoriasis.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with an applicator. It came in a timely fashion and in good condition. I think I will use local sources because I can get larger bottles that way. I would use this supplier for other purchases.</li>
    <li> Strong smell, but is good.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great but it is a bit runny coming out of the bottle compared to other more expensive brands like YL; if you don&#x27;t mind wasting a few extra drops, this line is a great alternative to spending $40/bottle!</li>
    <li> I love it.... I got it for my face acne and with a recipe my friend gave me  it did the job.</li>
    <li> Good oils. Good value.</li>
    <li> Very pleased! I&#x27;m not exactly a fan of the smell but I purchased it since I am pregnant acne medications cannot be used as they can cross the placenta and harm the baby. I use this oil by dabbing drops onto q-tips then directly onto pimples. I also dropped a few drops into my facial cleanser. You can also place a few drops into your moisturizer as well for those suffering acne. Tea tree oil has such long known great benefits in the treatment of acne. Also use this by mixing with witch hazel as an acne/toning astringent. This oil is also very potent, good quality.</li>
    <li> Oil has good benefits therapeutically not the greatest of smells. but can mix with other oils to make more pleasant. happy with bottle size and price!</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered the tea tree oil from Eden&#x27;s Garden I loved it.  It smelled good and worked fantastic (I used it as an acne medicine).  I decided to order another bottle because I liked the first one so much and have had a different experience.  It has a different smell that isn&#x27;t very pleasant and hasn&#x27;t seemed to work as well on my breakouts.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will order this product again and I&#x27;m not sure why the bottles smelled so different and have had different results.</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil for my acne, and it always helps. I focus on the break out, but it makes my skin smooth and brighter. This has a VERY strong smell, but I don&#x27;t mind since this was less expensive than other brands, but it does the same work.</li>
    <li> I use this as a part of a homemade facial moisturizer and I love the smell it gives what would otherwise be a somewhat unpleasant concoction. I also think it has helped improve the overall condition of my skin, in combination with other products.</li>
    <li> Did the job of getting rid of an ugly toenail fungus.  I&#x27;d had other products that never worked at all.&lt;br /&gt;After using this just a few times, my nail is healthy again and is growing nicely.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when I was first getting into essential oils. I have a couple of different brands and Eden&#x27;s Garden seems to be on par with the better quality oils that I have but at a lower price. I like to use tea tree oil in my scalp treatments for dry scalp. Be sure to dilute in a base oil.</li>
    <li> We will see if it does the job!</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good quality product but didn&#x27;t do anything for skin tags. Used it faithfully for two weeks but didn&#x27;t touch it.</li>
    <li> have been using tea tree oil for lots of things for years</li>
    <li> The amount in this bottle was EXTREMELY small. Only last a few days and it was already empty. Your better off buying a different brand with a bigger size. Overall, the other brands will save you more money since there is more oil in the bottle, which could be good for long term use.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for healing sores of any kind!</li>
    <li> I love using tea tree oil to make my own homemade products.  I learned that tea tree oil is naturally antibacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral.  So, it works great in shampoo, hand soap, dishwasher detergent, and a lot of other products.  It so easy to make your own products and this oil is truly essential.</li>
    <li> Superior quality. Delivered earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> As a ballet dancer, I find this effective in eliminating toenail fungus, rather than using a prescribed medication which can possibly cause liver damage. If you have under-the-nail toenail fungus, daily use of this product (diluted with water) and applied on the nail and at the cuticle will clear  up the situation within a couple of months.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oil! We use it for many things, but most frequently put it in with our baby wipes to keep them clean and mold free. We use a wipe warmer and just a few drops of this in our wipe mix and we haven&#x27;t had any issues since. No musty smells, no mold, just nice clean wipes. This has also been great for Acne and bug bites. This is my go to oil in many cases and Eden is quick and a great price for something we love.</li>
    <li> Quick arrival in good condition.  I have been very pleased with the product and have had a good experience.  This stuff rocks. Great price</li>
    <li> I order a different brand when my first bottle ran out. That brand smelled like cheap lysol cleaner. This brand smells great!</li>
    <li> I love to use tea tree oil to care for scrapes and bumps on my dogs. Good product and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Used it and the dry skin around my toes improved instantly!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery exactly as described</li>
    <li> I use a few drop in my shampoo and my hair feels super clean and dandruff-free. I also use a dab on major acne breakouts and I find their life-span decreases significantly. I&#x27;m looking for more uses for this product in my daily routine as this seems to be good quality tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Edens Garden is a good company that is willing to make it&#x27;s customer happy. I wasn&#x27;t completely happy with the first tea tree oil bottle I received and they paid for me to return it and sent me a new one. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my new bottle! Thank You so much Edens Garden!</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically to treat my eczema and psoriasis however I did not see any improvement. It was disappointing since nothing else has seemed to work on these conditions either. I plan on keeping the oil because I just received an emails about 70 other conditions Tea Tree Oil can help. Hoping for better results in the future. Edens Garden Oils are still amazing!</li>
    <li> Works well for what I am using it for</li>
    <li> I know that tea tree oil has multiple uses, but I primarily use it for acne. It has helped so much that I&#x27;ve quit using the prescriptions that my dermatologist prescribed. I was hesitant to put &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on my face, but you only need a very small amount &amp; it&#x27;s not like regular oil. It works great!</li>
    <li> One of the very best oils!</li>
    <li> Awesome! if you have feet that sweat a lot this will neutralize the bacteria causing the smell on your feet. best use it after showers</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil in my coconut hair oil to help combat dandruff, I also anoint my brushes with it, and rub it on my toes to prevent nail fungus (especially because I love going to nail shops for pedicures--one can never be too careful.) I love the quality of this seller&#x27;s oils. They are medicinal grade without the price tag of aura cassia or doterra, and they work just the same. I love that the seller does combination shipping too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awsome. I use it to get rid of these little bumps on my new piercing. I don&#x27;t mind the smell, I actually like it. It works great. Just don&#x27;t use it everyday because it will dry out your piercing in a couple of days. Just use it twice a week, you should be good to go.</li>
    <li> This oil was just fabulous I use it in my hair products and i love it!</li>
    <li> Great for acne sufferers. I use it every night on my face AFTER moisturizing to prevent pimples...tip from my aesthetician. I use it on my nails after a mani/pedi to prevent infections.  I mix it in a medicine dropper along with Jamaican black castor oil, eucalyptus oil and lavender oil. I apply it directly to my scalp. Great for natural hair that is dry. This oil has so many uses!</li>
    <li> It works when I use it :). So far so good.</li>
    <li> great tea tree oil. very pure and strong</li>
    <li> I like a lot. Non greasy formula. Drys quickly with all the benefits.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Bought this and many other oils for the wife.  I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of Edens Gardens Essential Oils.  They seem to utilize excellent extraction procedures as well as quality control in the manufacture of their products.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone interested in essential oils.</li>
    <li> The tea tree oil is pretty good. It made my skin soft &amp; smoothe. It has a strong powerful smell to it</li>
    <li> You only need a few drops and this is quite a large amount of tea tree oil for the price.</li>
    <li> great scent..economically priced</li>
    <li> i sturggle with HS and its an autoimmune disease. THIS HELPS TRAUMATICALLY. i feel instantly better taking baths of this because my skin clears up</li>
    <li> I love Tea Tree and I&#x27;m very pleased with this sellers product. It&#x27;s very high quality.  I use it as part of my skincare routine but also mix it with jojoba and use o my scalp when it gets dry.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work :( we tried many times on small or big the skin tag doesn&#x27;t &#x27; t go away at all</li>
    <li> I like the price of Eden Farms and the speedy delivery I purchased this for my daughter. I use Tea Tree oil for cleaning as well as in lotions or for rubs for joints.</li>
    <li> I use this as a facial cleanser. It has worked tremendously with getting rid of my redness problem around my nose.</li>
    <li> Love this... I use it for acne blemishes, it actually helps dry them up overnight!! Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth!!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate it at a five, but I have seen some improvment. I also know someone who used this product and said it was great.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I would recommend this essential oil as a staple in your arsenal.  Helpful at treating bruises and hair/scalp in general.</li>
    <li> Bought this to treat toe nail fungus.  Happy to report that the nail is halfway grown out after a month and a half and the new nail growing in looks great!!!</li>
    <li> Great for your scalp, and many other uses.</li>
    <li> IT IS A VERY GOOD QUALITY OIL</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this one.  I add a few drops to my night cream (I also add frankincense &amp; lemon) &amp; it keeps my face clear and pores shrunk.  Also, for occasionall monthly break outs, dab a bit of this directly on the blemish &amp; it&#x27;s GONE the next day.</li>
    <li> Used it on my dog to treat some spots he had and it worked! and the item came in when it said it would be in! Also helps heal minor wounds. I still have not had a chance to use it on my face i heard it helps with your acne :)</li>
    <li> It works on my pimples! I love this product it is so effective :)</li>
    <li> Really enjoy the essential oils from Edens Garden.</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> We have young kids and we use this any time we take them to public places where their heads will be near other kids heads. Movie theaters, sports or any other activities that would require close contact. This item has helped our kids remain lice free while other kids got lice. Also, I&#x27;ve used it on a small pimple/ingrown hair on my head and made it go away after a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I used this after I showered and dried my toe nails, then I would apply tree tea oil and it helped out allot.</li>
    <li> Great for so many anti-bacterial applications.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Great product , and I enjoyed their booklet , will buy from them when I need anything else!!!</li>
    <li> A bit expensive, but nice product.  Would have given 5 stars if it was a little cheaper.  I used just a couple of drops in a saline rinse when my kids got colds.</li>
    <li> Hate the smell, but love what it does</li>
    <li> Stinks bad but when applied neat to a cold sore it heals within 2 days. Your results may vary. Just remember to apply it first to a cotton swab before putting some on your face so you don&#x27;t cause cross contamination. This is an anti everything: viral, fungal, and bacterial so the uses for tea tree oil are endless. This is a strong good quality product. Please be sure to keep it away from children and pets because even the fumes can be toxic! Would recommend and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this essential oil along with the lemon eucalyptus and citronella to help with a spider issue in my house. Mixing these oils individually with witch hazel and putting them in spray bottles to spray around windows and doors has helped keep some of the more adventurous and aggressive spiders at bay. I have also used each one individually around the house. The oils are strong and pure, the scents are beautiful and aromatic.</li>
    <li> I order the tea tree oil in order to replace the tea bags in my hairdrenaline potion! I don&#x27;t really like the burning smell of my previous potion, therefore I get this pure tea tree which make the same work as the regular black tea. just few drops for 48 bags.</li>
    <li> nice essential oil, it works well and it is as described.  i would definitely order again, great value for oil.</li>
    <li> I used this to clear up and clean my bell button piercing.&lt;br /&gt;Worked like a charm</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a believer,  has healed all my cuts and minor infections. Also use a couple of drops with thimble full of ky jell for  nose as a preventative against MRSA infections.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember order it, but yes, after I see that it is the Meleluca one, then I do remember ordering it.  Then again, The shipping was suppose to be FREE when i HAD TO PAY THE SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Absolutely horrible! Rancid in smell and the texture is not right either! It&#x27;s cheap for a reason. Stay away!</li>
    <li> I use this Tea Tree oil for disinfecting hairbrushes ,Tooth brush holder and in my hair i add a few drops to my shampoo and conditioner and massage through my scalp i have noticed my hair has grown a little since using this along with Rosemary.Edens Garden is the best and i will always buy their oils.</li>
    <li> Completely removed a subcutaneous keratosis I had on my ear. Options were to have taken off with C02 in the MD office or to try oils. No pain, no mess, no big expense! Love Edens Garden oils!</li>
    <li> My mom has toe fungus and it&#x27;s been curing it but idk if it nessasirly is curing any of the acne I have currently. This stuff ships fast so I suggest ordering this if you KNOW its working for you, and it even came w a little packet talking about other oils and what theyre for and why you should try em. thanks edens garden :)</li>
    <li> was informed this mixed with water in spray will help with woodticks</li>
    <li> Wow! My purchase from Eden&#x27;s Garden was my first time buying Tea Tree Oil. After reading of it&#x27;s many benefits, I was very excited to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is packaged in a small amber bottle. It has a strange dropper inside that I don&#x27;t quite understand, so I just shake out a drop through the top as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drop is usually all that I need. While having many benefits, Tea Tree Oil has a very strong scent. I add one drop to my shampoo to knock out dandruff, and it works excellently for that purpose. It can dry the hair out a bit, so I will run a touch of conditioner over my scalp after. This was an amazing benefit for me since I don&#x27;t want to use any sulfate and silicone-laden dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I also add a drop to my face wash about once a week and wash my entire face with the mixture. It is cooling and refreshing while clearing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite uses for this oil is an acne spot treatment. After applying this a few times, pimples stop in their tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I love this oil! It is so useful to me, and even the small bottle will last me a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I can buy from Eden&#x27;s Garden with confidence, knowing that their EOs are of good quality, quantity, and have so many uses.&lt;br /&gt;Attached is a picture of the three oils I have purchased with a tape measure for scale.</li>
    <li> Oil was good. I would never buy from Edens Garden again until they got their ducks in a row and educate themselves on the oily business.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister because she had a nail fungus. This product cleared it up immediately. I definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I read about this product online and it said it was great for wounds, etc.  I tried it and really works!!</li>
    <li> Tea Tree oil is good for many things, and I can not imagine living without it in my home. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> works well for acne! smell isn&#x27;t bad.. just not too pleasant. strong smell</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> The tea tree oil helped my blemishes go way pretty quickly, a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I used this as a spot treatment for acne. I have been using it about a week and it seems to be working just fine. I would do a spot treatment before applying too much because it did cause some drying on my face. Overall I feel like it was a wonderful addition to my skincare regimen.</li>
    <li> prompt service, will have to purchase more in bulk next time...if you like tea tree oil you will be satisfied</li>
    <li> i think this product sells itself.  I love how it makes my scalp feel and its healing properties as well.  didnt take long to arrive either</li>
    <li> works to reduce the size, color and soreness of pimples! love it! the smell isn&#x27;t the best but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I buy from Edens Garden a lot and haven&#x27;t been disappointed with an oil from them. I liked the Tea Tree fragrance a lot and burn it often at home. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, good shipping! True to color &amp; size too. Seems to be well made &amp; natural. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Great! Smells perfect but when making lotions/ChapStick&#x27;s not very strong. Need a lot. Love the smell so fresh smells even better mixed with grapefruit</li>
    <li> I use this in a recipe with shea butter and coconut oil to make a night time facial moisturizer.  It works great!</li>
    <li> This is a little smaller than I was expecting, but it still smells great and does the job. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil has helped my toe nails in just 3 days no longer in pain ! It is well worth a try I was amazed and very happy at the results so far.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do what I intended it to do but it works on many other things that I now use it for.</li>
    <li> its ok!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer because of the quality and speed of Eden&#x27;s Garden and their products.  Will Definitely buy in the future!</li>
    <li> I think this is a very decent grade oil, I have used it in a manner consistent to some recipes I have dug up on the internet and it worked as I expected it to.</li>
    <li> You can make a paste of baking soda and water, then add a drop or two of tea tree oil, and use this as a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good quality oil. It has a strong scent, but it&#x27;s quite pleasant after you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil works well on my acne.. I mix it with evoo since tea tree can be a bit drying and mix it in a bottle and put it on everynight and my skin looks smoother and clearer. A few drops are needed as a little goes a long way it is very potent and has a strong odor. I actually like using it but my family has complained about the smell smelling like gasoline so I had to stop using tea tree :/ .  But I still use it occasionally on my acne prone face if I&#x27;m home alone and it still works wonderfully....as for this seller I am happy as I was sent the wrong oil but they sent me the right one very fast and free of chare :) the oils are of good quality and the DO work ..I would give it five  stars but because of the strong odor I took one star off</li>
    <li> Works well when added to hand soap to naturally kill germs without harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Has a strong odor. Watch out. But if mixed right it smells great</li>
    <li> I got what I ordered...Tea Tree Oil.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with essential oils.  I read online recommendations about adding Tea Tree oil to my shampoo to remove styling product buildup and to balance my oily scalp.  Unfortunately, I added a few too many drops to a 30 fl. oz. bottle of shampoo and now I&#x27;m paying for it.  The shampoo stinks and so does my scalp and hair.  That being said, my scalp isn&#x27;t oily as it usually is just a few hours after washing.  I guess, nothing a little perfume can&#x27;t cover up since this stuff apparently works.</li>
    <li> I recently went natural in Feb 2012 and I have been having problems with itching and dry scalp. I bought this product and mixed it with shea butter, castor oil, jojoba oil and olive oil and I love it. I now have no more itching or dry scalp. I also mix this product with Jamaican castor oil and oil my scalp, it works wonders.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase from this brand. I purchased the tea tree oil and cedarwood oil. I have used other brands of these oils in the past and enjoyed them. The ones from eden brand have a bad petroleum- like smell. Perhaps they are rancid.The scent gives me an instant headache.</li>
    <li> Company philosophy, cutting out the middleman and providing a pure product has made me a loyal customer with my first order.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s put it this way my dog loved it, stopped her itching I put it on the brush and then brushed her.</li>
    <li> love this- put in into coconut oil and use as a face wash- really helps keep the blemishes away</li>
    <li> I really am blown away by this. I added half the bottle to my current gel cleanser I&#x27;m using and my skin has cleared of blemishes in a matter of days. I&#x27;ve been using the rest of it as spot treatment for blemishes and it works better then an expensive La Roche Posay spot cream I purchased. Its gentle doesn&#x27;t burn my dissolves into my skin just fine. I am definitely buying this regularly now, I&#x27;m a believer in natural oils because of this product!</li>
    <li> Purchase this for skin tag removal works great. Put on twice a day for a few days and there gone.</li>
    <li> Decent amount for the price. Comes with a booklet of all other oils from this company and what they can be used for (very helpful) I use this for zits. If you dab a bit on your problem areas an hour before you need them gone, there will be much less redness in the area and reduced size in the zit. But of course it doesn&#x27;t make them completely disappear nor is this an everyday use for fear of drying out your skin. Very good if you have a night on the town or special occasion!</li>
    <li> I just want to start off by saying that this is seriously a miracle in a bottle. When you have lost all hope with acne, bacterial infections, fungal infections, or simply don&#x27;t know what the heck is wrong with your skin, give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I was at the end of my rope with my face. I made it all the way through high school without a single blemish, and when I turned 23-years-old, I was battling a full on face of them. I guess it could be attributed to stress, but whatever the case may be, my acne sent me into a depression.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it all. Every acne product out there has been slathered on my face in a desperate attempt to get my clear skin back. Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;I started to do some research on tea tree oil, and the success rates seemed high enough to give it a shot. I figured if this didn&#x27;t work then it was time for me to go to the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;I am currently into a week of having my oil, and I kid you not, my skin is near FLAWLESS. I wish I could post a before and after picture, that is how dramatic the difference is.&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of people post about having to dilute this solution, however, I never did. My skin may not be as sensitive as it is to others, but I just dabbed it on with a q-tip after I put on my moisturizer. A little goes a long way, but I have already ordered my second bottle because I am going to use it for spot treatments for the rest of my existence.&lt;br /&gt;So please, give this a try. Grab your self-esteem out of the gutter. Get your confidence back. Be comfortable in your own skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, tea tree oil!</li>
    <li> I use this oil for my mosquito bites - it calms down the reaction super fast!!! Highly recommend this brand!</li>
    <li> Smells great and is helping a little with my feet</li>
    <li> I will buy again. Real good tea tree oil. A little goes a long ways. Overall a good product to buy.</li>
    <li> I love this product and this company. I have now made multiple purchases from them and each time I have been satisfied. I mainly use this product as a mixture with a few other oils for my hair and my fiance uses it for his toe nails and puts a few drops in a foot bath after long days of work and playing basketball to help prevent athletes foot.</li>
    <li> Everything I was hoping for--I finally made the purchase after reading MANY good posts/blogs.  I will be purchasing tea tree, again.</li>
    <li> I loved it but I used up the entire bottle!! Need to buy again. I recommend mixing with something for a toner because it works wonders for clearing pores and preventing break outs! Definitely has a burning feeling if u use the product direct on your skin so be warned not too close to your eyes. I thought it was cool that when I put near my nose it cleared my sinus!!! Very awesome product and will buy again - this was my first time using tea tree oil</li>
    <li> I got the tea tree oil because I heard it was suppose to help with the removal of skin tags. I love tea tree oil but it didn&#x27;t work for my skin tags. But, it does work for other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to others</li>
    <li> Did not care for the smell, reminded me of mildew. Was not impressed with anti-bacterial features.</li>
    <li> Did not receive a Tea Tree, just a bottle of liquid.</li>
    <li> This broke me out but it might work for you idk!</li>
    <li> Mix it with Shea butter, lavender oil, rosemary  and apply to my skin. So far so good. Sometimes it&#x27;s dry up your skin. I believe it&#x27;s the effect of Shea butter not the oil. Shea butter alone dried up your skin. Delivery was fast. Very satisfy</li>
    <li> This oil has been around for years. I feel as though it still works just as good as ever. I bought this for my daughter who has muluscum. It has cleared the bumps as long as you apply it twice a day. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best multi purpose oils around. I use it for my hair, skin, and cleaning solutions. Very good value and quality.</li>
    <li> Great smell, worked awesome in the lotion I made</li>
    <li> I realy like the oil it work for me, I would recommend Tree oil to everyone who uses any kind of oils.</li>
    <li> The odor is so offensive that I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> I have always like the tea tree oil scent.  Use it in my diffuser!</li>
    <li> Nice organic Melaleuca oil!</li>
    <li> I use this as part of my hair treatment routine as well as in my coconut oil lotions. It is good quality and the price is fantastic. I still haven&#x27;t gone through the whole bottle yet!</li>
    <li> Oil arrived on time and was packaged securely. It was a reasonable price &amp; therefore, I will be shopping there again for this and other oils.</li>
    <li> Love having this to have that clean home, hospital smell.  This def is something to also have in your basic essential oil collection.  It literally makes even the air smell like its been disinfected or cleared.  I like to have this around as it makes me feel like the unnecessary microbes are in control lol.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works in mysterious ways. The odor is not the best (a turn off most of the time),but the results after using it for a day is EXCELLENT. Its worth the price....Will recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Worked well for its intended purpose, but stinks like heck. Use in a well ventilated area or you&#x27;ll get high from the fumes.</li>
    <li> Really great quality oil!</li>
    <li> These definitely are not as high quality as YL but I thought I would try them (bought tea tree oil, geranium, and ylang ylang) for the price. If you just want to diffuse them for the smell they will do.</li>
    <li> high quality and awesome price! fast shipping! highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> So nice n pure to my face but super small</li>
    <li> I mostly use this tea tree oil on my face for pimples, it helps to dry them up and heal faster. I also use this tea tree oil for cold sores, it also helps to dry them up and they heal faster that way. My father used this tea tree oil, a slight dab, on his canker sores inside his mouth, which seemed to help.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil and lavender for home use.  I put the oil directly on my skin as it has healing properties.  Tea tree is a natural flea repellent (for animals) and safe to use.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Wonderful product I full love it and highly suggest anyone to buy essential oils from this brand!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to help save my dermals from migrating and even after a few uses its doing the job well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month and haven&#x27;t seen huge results but have seen some.</li>
    <li> This oil is excellent.  It has many uses.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone.  The&lt;br /&gt;price was good and it arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Bought this for toenail fungus and after one week it already seems to be working! Great stuff and a great price!!</li>
    <li> I bought the tea tree oil as a natural way to tame mild acne.  It feels fresh on my skin.  The smell is a little strong at first but it wears off pretty quickly</li>
    <li> I did not have previous experience with this products, I talked with a friend of mine that is an expert on this kind products and she recommended me this product.</li>
    <li> Great oil at a great price &amp; fast shipping. Plus, I love the pamphlet enclosed &amp; the Bible references made about some of the oils! I will probably order from them again.</li>
    <li> Love this product I only by from them. Love to clean with these oils great fragrances and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference in my acne... It works</li>
    <li> Used it for yellowing toe nails and worked within a few uses. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected in secure packaging. Smells very strong. Use with caution but I use it for the antibacterial properties. Works great. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a refill order. Love the benefits of this  awesome oil! For an earache I apply this neat on my ear lobes for excellent pain relief. It clears up athlete&#x27;s foot for my husband and is a spot treat for my daughters acne flare ups. Eden&#x27;s Garden oils are THE best.</li>
    <li> Helped a lot with my sisters lice , and I use it in my hair regularly , in a spray bottle mixed with war meter , and honestly since I&#x27;ve been doing this , my hair is healthier and it just looks better !</li>
    <li> i suffer from psoriasis and some moron told me to mix it with cream etc..... Blah blah yada yada guess what didnt work for nothing i used 2 bottles already oh and for pimples it only works a little overall dont fall for reviews well on my case u want magic for psoriasis try tea tree manuca rosalina and trust me youll see results u dont believe me call me 956-279-1174 ill send u pix before and after</li>
    <li> I am an essential oil user. I use tea tree oil in the wash with my daughters cloth diapers. I am happy with Edens Garden brand.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this for a lot of cosmetic and cleaning applications.  It&#x27;s good for face wash (with baking soda and coconut oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I use the Tea Tree essential oil as an alternative in my diffuser, or an additive to other essential oils. I like to try different mixtures.</li>
    <li> I use the Tea Tree oil for small scrapes and cuts, it helps heal quicker.</li>
    <li> Literally, my tea tree oil came in the mail like two days ago and I love it already. I originally bought it for a keloid I had around a nipple piercing. I applied it once &amp; seriously like the keloid was almost nonexistent the next day. Now im gonna use it for acne treatment &amp; well see how it goes. The smell is strong but I like the clean smell of it. If you use it on your face, put moistrizer on afterwards as the oul can make your skin a bit dry. Definitely buying the bigger bottle next time.</li>
    <li> Works great I need more</li>
    <li> Came quickly and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I received my shipment in a timely manner (less than 2 weeks) and it was packed very secure and had a nice presentation. The oils were potent and I am very satisfied with my purchase. I look forward to do more business with this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life, NO MAN cometh to the Father, but by him, John 14:6, the King James Bible, Gods perfect word. You must be BORN AGAIN to enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:3), and NOT of works but by the grace of God through faith and NOT of yourselves, it is the gift of God (Ephesians 2), for sinners like you and I. If you are NOT born again, you are not saved and you will be cast into hell the moment you die. Please take heed, get a 1769 edition (1611) King James Bible and start in the book of John, it will show you Jesus was not just a man with another &amp;#34;religion&amp;#34; but indeed God in the flesh, who reconciled the world to himself (2 Corinthians 5:18-19).</li>
    <li> Great, need to be more presestent with use though.</li>
    <li> It is tea tree oil. Who does not love this stuff? Ok if you don&#x27;t know where or what to use it for let me tell you. You can use this on rashes ANYWHERE ON YOUR BODY!!! I was in the desert over seas and I had dermatitis from washing my clothes in the washing machines over there. My t-shirts left a rash on my body. My BDU shirt did not leave a rash but my under t-shirt did. I used the tea tree oil and BAM it was gone over night and no more problems. I also used it on my BUM. I don&#x27;t know if it was from sand or what but I used it and I have never ever years later had a problem. I have had my teenager use it for acne and it cleared 90% of it completely up! Don&#x27;t use it close to your eyes because it is as potent as peppermint around your eyes. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like peppermint though. My son said it makes him feel fresh after using it on his face. He was 16 when he first used it and now he is 18. I bought this for a fertilizer and when he saw it come in he made about 50 excuses to take it away from me. I finally said well you know all you have to do is ask and you can have it. He said &amp;#34;CAN I PLEASE HAVE IT?&amp;#34; Ok so I hope this helps everyone. You can use this on rashes, cuts, burns (not the ones that require hospitalization). Don&#x27;t use this if you know you should go to the hospital. This is just better than peroxide or alcohol!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone who may have a dry scalp. I bought this exceptional quality oil and added a little to my shampoo &amp; conditioner and after washing my hair my scalp felt amazing. The delivery time was very fast, I actually had it in my mail box sooner than I expected.</li>
    <li> This product is very toxic have to be careful about putting it directly on the skin ... arrived on time and intact</li>
    <li> Love my Tea Tree Oil! Highly Recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> Price and quality seem good enough.</li>
    <li> good stuff. It has the cap that I prefer.</li>
    <li> If you are using this product to get rid of toe nail fungus, it didn&#x27;t work for me, but try Vicks mentholated ointment, so far I&#x27;ve seen results. My doctor told me his diabetic patients swear by it for getting rid of toe nail fungus.</li>
    <li> A bit strong and I think it will keep mosquitoes away in the summer.</li>
    <li> If your seeking the highest quality Tea Tree oil, than this brand will be your choice. I also like its easy application of dispensing drops, just by simply tuning the bottle upside down. I&#x27;ve saved the bottle after use, for other liquid products because it dispenses so well.</li>
