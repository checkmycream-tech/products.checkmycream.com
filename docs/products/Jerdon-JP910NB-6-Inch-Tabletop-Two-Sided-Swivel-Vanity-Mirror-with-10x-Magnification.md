<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I saw myself therefore it worked!</li>
    <li> It is so great! And it is exactly what I wanted in the first place. And it is also well-designed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!</li>
    <li> It would be perfect if it were a little bigger, but it does what it was meant to do and looks nice too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the optics are very good in the mirror there is some distortion. Put it into a vacation rental, I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a daily.</li>
    <li> great mirror and good price thru amazon.  I&#x27;ve had for about 5 years now, looks good on my vanity, matches the hardware very well.</li>
    <li> This made my vanity table complete. The design was what really got me in the first place and now I&#x27;m really obsessed about it. Although it was quite small from the photo in here, it doesn&#x27;t really matter. I got what I want.</li>
    <li> As long as you have a stable top to put this mirror on, it can be your best friend!  This particular model does not require a lot of space or hardware to place on a wall--it simply can be scooted into a counter corner away from traffic (children and husband).  It is most useful when applying make up or shaping the finest brows to the milli-hair that it out of place.  I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Some magnifying mirrors distort, this one doesn&#x27;t! Also an attractive design, which is nice, since it&#x27;s not something that fits into a drawer to get it out of sight. Good value, for price paid.</li>
    <li> Completely pleased with the quality and appearance of this mirror.  It is sturdy, well-made and attractive for every day use.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. Had it for over a year now. Used it very frequently. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Small footprint for my small makeup table. It&#x27;s actually nicer looking than in the photo. When you tilt it, it stays tilted. 10X magnification a bit startling at first, but it&#x27;s brilliant for perfect eye-makeup application. Am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror about a month ago.  I thought I needed a lighted one, but couldn&#x27;t find one, so bought this.  Sit in front of a window, and you&#x27;ll have all the (natural) light you need, with super-great 10X vision.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Just recently got contacts and needed a mirror to help me get them in and out.  This one is great.  Simple and does exactly what I need it to do.  Has paid for itself since I messed up a few lenses before I got it and now I&#x27;m able to put in and remove my contacts easily, without damaging them.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror and even though it&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s ok because i literally put the mirror 5 inches away from my face because I don&#x27;t have my contacts on</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. Good for seeing up close, no reading glasses required. I couldn&#x27;t live without this mirror.</li>
    <li> Good sturdy mirror.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be larger and much greater magnification than it turned out to be. I would not have bought it, had I known. It would also be a service, if sellers would include a sense of scale in their photos--like a pen, soda can, hair brush-- anything to relay an accurate sense of the size of their products.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted!  I especially like the 10X magnification and nickel finish.  Great price and excellent deal!</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but very attractive and 10x magnification excellent</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these, one for each daughter in college.  The girls love these mirrors!  Great quality!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because it seemed to be a very good mirror (which it is) and looks terrific on my bathroom vanity.  I think it adds class and style to any room.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great.  It&#x27;s clear and heavy. Very high quality for the price.  I&#x27;m happy I purchased this item :)</li>
    <li> Nthis is exactly as advertised. A sturdy super magnifying mirror!  No problems with it. But you should make sure that you have good lighting, as there is no light.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror. Good clarity. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Great price and looks nice on the vanity.  Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, clear mirror.  I like the sturdy construction.  The 10x side is not distorted, even to the edges of the mirror.  It&#x27;s just the right size. If you&#x27;re not using a very bright light with this mirror, it is quite dark (like all 10x mirrors are).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, but I wish I would have gotten one with a built-in light.</li>
    <li> I ordered these as Christmas gifts because of the large magnification (for us older folks).  I bet they will be well received!</li>
    <li> I  have blond hair which is hard to see when plucking my eye brows,  this really helps me see them blond ones.</li>
    <li> The mirror was exactly as described.  It has great magnification on one side and is a normal mirror on the other side.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this so I could see every hair when I tweeze my eyebrows. This mirror is great but it would be even better if it lit up.</li>
    <li> This is an attractive mirrow that compliments my vanity.  I wanted/needed more magnification than my previous mirrors, and this 10x certainly provides that.</li>
    <li> Simple, sturdy design. Tilt stays where you place it. Nice finish. Size is good - doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the counter and is large enough to see what you need to.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a pleasant surprise and surpassed my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 11\\&quot; inches high. The foot has a diameter of 3.5\\&quot; inches and is covered with a soft material at the bottom so you don&#x27;t scratch the surface of your dresser or counter. The mirror surface is 5.5\\&quot; inches across, just the right size so that you can see your face about from eye brows to chin (your mileage may vary) on the 10x magnified side of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror also has quite a substantial weight and doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap in any way. It seems well constructed with attention to detail. When you tilt the mirror, it stays that way. The tension seems perfectly adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no distortion to the regular mirror. I&#x27;m no expert, but it seems to be a real mirror (not metal). As is normal, the magnification side of the mirror is curved, as are all magnification mirrors. It doesn&#x27;t effect your close-up view. 10x is a perfect size for cosmetic purposes or eye treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and consider the mirror an extraordinary value compared to similar products.</li>
    <li> Jerdon is known for it&#x27;s high quality mirrors. This mirror meets that reputation at an affordable price level.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is clear, the metal stand and frame is firm and stable.&lt;br /&gt;10X magnification is perfect for those with near vision issues. Putting in contacts, eye make up, tweezing are all accomplished with ease.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, she loves this mirror.  Great price got it fast</li>
    <li> The mirror looked pretty good online but it looks even better in person.  Nice!</li>
    <li> although the ad says the mirror is 6\\&quot;, the actual diameter of the 10x side mirror is only 5.25\\&quot; which is a little small, 6.5\\&quot; would be perfect especially when used to pluck out  facial hair with tweezers. on the other mirror side which is the 1x side the actual mirror diameter is 5.75\\&quot; which is just the right size, not too big or too small. on the 10x side despite   being a little small at 5.25\\&quot;, it&#x27;s still pretty good for plucking out facial hairs as the 10x magnification really exposes hard to see thin hairs. mirror is not lighted, but that problem  can easily be solved if used in sunlight or with lamp or flashlight. base is weighted which makes it stable and padding on bottom prevents scratching and the mirror and finish both  look professional.</li>
    <li> What I received was a 3X mirror, not a 10X. I have two 10X mirrors and know what to expect.  I&#x27;m not happy about this, I expected better quality control from Amazon.  I wasn&#x27;t given an option to replace, only to return, but I won&#x27;t re-order even though it looks like most of the other buyers got what they expected.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 of these mirrors, one for myself and my daughters.  The mirror was much nicer than the picture depicted it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is nice.  I can see clearly using it. No problems, product is as described.</li>
    <li> Had this for about a year already.  Still in good condition.  I thought I would be okay with the mirror size, but having it for about a year I&#x27;m realizing I should of gotten a bigger mirror.</li>
    <li> The magnifying mirror is amazing. However, when light is reflected on it, it like... feels wierd when it flashes on my eye! Haha, but duhh.. that&#x27;s magnifying glasses for you. Anyway, it&#x27;s SMALLER than I expected, but it was accurate 6-inches. I thought it would be bigger! I wish it had the lights thing that my friend has her&#x27;s lights up and is bigger, but I wanted to buy this one cause it&#x27;s cheap and had great reviews. Anyway, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far, tried it tonight and got it this morning. It has great mirrors, can see all your little eyebrow hairs and little stubbles or extra hairs on your face or whatever hah x)</li>
    <li> Works great. What I really like about this mirror is that you can adjust the angle to suit yourself. Also, since I wear glasses, I can take my glasses off and move closer or farther away from the mirror and find a distance where everything is in focus without my glasses. Highly recommend it for folks using contacts. You can see what you are doing without glasses and see if you are having a problem putting them in or taking them out.</li>
    <li> It took me about a week to get use to it, but I am very pleased with the quality of the glass in this mirror.  It is heavy enough not to topple over and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Very well made and fancy looking, I use it everyday on my dressing table so I have a close up mirror for putting make up on with also great magnification for tweezing eye brows........</li>
    <li> was as described, just would rather have a larger mirror.  Will keep for now.  It does really, really magnify to do my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this mirror.  It is heavy enough to feel like it is made of quality materials, and the mirror itself provides an undistorted reflection.  The base is small enough to fit on a windowsill so that I can see the back of my hair, and the magnification side is just right.</li>
    <li> This is a slightly cheap mirror, not very good quality, but it does the job. Don&#x27;t expect something amazing for this price though, it&#x27;s a bit feeble and won&#x27;t hold up for long. The base of mine was already peeling off and stuck on wonky when it arrived. The mirror is a little like those plastic warped ones, so not great as it distorts your face.</li>
    <li> Great Mirror and sturdy!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best cosmetic mirrors I have ever owned.  The magnification is great. I use it to put on my makeup, and to pluck my eyebrows.  It is nice to look at also.</li>
    <li> This tabletop mirror is definitely worth the price! The view is clear and the mirror is delicate. It looks like a princess&#x27;s mirror.</li>
    <li> Mirror is good quality and very solid. The hinge is stable and the magnification shows you all the little details (whether you like them or not).  I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> High quality. Has survived several falls without breaking.</li>
    <li> I purchased several of these for an Artistry Skin Care Party I was hosting.  They worked out perfectly!  Perfect size!</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Beautiful finish.  Solid, heavy base gives it good stability.  I bought this to replace an old vanity mirror that finally broke and I wish I would have gotten this one sooner.  It&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great little mirror! Excellent at magnifying</li>
    <li> I really love this mirror. I bought one for myself, and then bought 2 more as gifts for my sister and my mom. It&#x27;s very classy to look at, and I love the look of the nickel finish. I also just really love the mirror. It magnifies 10X on the one side, and I love that I can see my face and eyebrows so clearly and close up. So glad that I found this mirror.</li>
    <li> 10x magnification can be a bit overwhelming if you are not used to seeing your face that up close and personal, but this is a tweezer girls dream mirror!  You can see everything! And, the mirror is a nice size, looks good on your dresser, nightstand, or bathroom counter top... although, I probably would have bought the rubbed bronze one if I had saw that one first I am quite satisfied with this purchase.  If you are like me and like to see what&#x27;s really going on with those eyebrows or with your pores, this is a must buy!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my makeup station!! Perfect size, and it looks great!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price</li>
    <li> This is an attractive mirror. I haven&#x27;t seen one locally that looks as nice.</li>
    <li> I accidentally broke my old mirror and needed a replacement. Finally I found this one on Amazon and decided to order it.  The magnification is much better than my older mirror and it looks good in my bathroom.  Definitely would recommend this to anyone needing a mirror as a replacement or first time purchase.  Makeup application is much easier now.</li>
    <li> The mirror is great. The magnifying quality is clear and zooms in enough to do my eyebrows. I do hate that it doesn&#x27;t have a light but it&#x27;s still a good buy. I would definitely recommend this to anyone needing a mirror to zoom in.</li>
    <li> Nice quality product!  I am glad I purchased this product. Worth the price!  The item is exactly as described and I do recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely mirror and does a nice job of magnifying. But I did not realize that it was so small.</li>
    <li> This mirror is wonderful -- just what I wanted but could not find in stores locally.  I didn&#x27;t want lights with bulbs and batteries to replace so I chose this mirror.  The base is weighted which gives it a nice feel when you pick it up.  The tension is set so the mirror stays in place when you get it at the angle you want.  The 10x magnification is wonderful -- I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!!  When I&#x27;m not using the mirror, it sits there and looks pretty!</li>
    <li> This mirror works well for me when I&#x27;m getting myself ready for the day - makeup application, checking hairstyling, etc.  It has a good \\&quot;solid\\&quot; feel, not cheap or flimsy like some similar items some other retailers offer.  Glad I chose this mirror.</li>
    <li> 1st off this mirror is small and the viewing angle is horrible. For the best viewing angle you need to hold this to your face with one hand while using your other hang to pluck hair etc and it&#x27;s very uncomfortable. Even with plenty of light you will have a hard time using this mirror as its small. Its nice looking but not practical.</li>
    <li> I thought the mirror would be much taller (like the ones you see at Target or Ulta. That was my fault as they gave the measurements). The mirror is sturdy and nice looking in spite of its small size. The regular side is OK: I can see my whole face and the picture is clear and sharp. However, the magnifying side is almost useless as the image is very blurry and very much out of focus, as a picture you zoom too many times on the computer. If I wanted to pluck my eyebrows I would need to place my nose directly against the mirror in order to see the individual hairs (No I do not have a long nose:)).</li>
    <li> After many years of cheap mirrors with cheap stands, I finally decided to get something more substantial. I had two Conair mirrors with plastic stands. I had to replace one with the other because I dropped the first one and the stand snapped off. There was no way to fix it. After it happened again to the second mirror, I was fed up. Fed up with the cheap quality of the mirrors. Plus the whole thing was just way too short. I always had to put the mirror in my hands, put it up close to my face and apply my makeup. That&#x27;s extremely inconvenient having only one hand to do my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is finally what I needed! It&#x27;s the perfect height on my desk. I don&#x27;t have to pick it up, it&#x27;s at a perfect eye level for me, I have both my hands available to do my makeup and the stand is not cheap. I&#x27;m not going to test it, but I think it can withstand a lot of beating to it. I really don&#x27;t think the stand will snap off if you drop it. The stand seems securely bolted to the mirror. The mirror size is perfect. I can see my whole face and then some in the normal magnification. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll really use the 10X side. It&#x27;s really magnified! You have to go really up close to see your reflection. I feel like I can see molecules with this magnification strength! I might use it from time to time, but I&#x27;ll be using the normal side most often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At such a great price, I couldn&#x27;t pass this up. I&#x27;ve seen mirrors that were over 50 dollars and I don&#x27;t know why. This mirror is cheap but it&#x27;s AMAZING. I highly recommend it. No more mirrors with plastic stands EVER AGAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: I recently knocked the mirror off my desk. It landed on my hardwood floor. So what happened? Nothing! It didn&#x27;t break! The mirror was intact, the stand didn&#x27;t break off, it was fine! I freaked out and thought I had to buy a new mirror. Thank goodness it didn&#x27;t break!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/9/13: I dropped the mirror on my rug with hardwood flooring underneath. The normal magnification side shattered. Three years later and it died. :( So sad. What&#x27;s interesting is that on the back of the magnified mirror, it has \\&quot;8X\\&quot; stamped on it. So does that mean it&#x27;s only 8X magnification? Nevertheless, I&#x27;m definitely going to repurchase. I don&#x27;t use the magnified side very often anyway. I&#x27;m currently using a mirror as a temporary replacement that&#x27;s significantly shorter and it&#x27;s annoying me like crazy. I need the height that this Jerdon mirror gave me. It&#x27;s at perfect eye level for me on my desk. I still highly recommend this mirror after three years. I don&#x27;t know why people have said that my review wasn&#x27;t helpful, but whatever. I love this mirror and I will continue to buy it if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/28/13: I actually decided to get the 8-inch Jerdon mirror instead and it&#x27;s significantly bigger. This 6-inch mirror looks very small compared to the 8-inch mirror. I posted a picture in the 8-inch mirror page, so check it out if you&#x27;re curious. While the 8-inch one only has 5x magnification, I do like how big it is. Plus, it cost just a tiny bit more. It takes up more space on my desk, but the mirror is huge! I still think the 6-inch one is a good mirror if you don&#x27;t have that much space or you don&#x27;t need such a big mirror. I&#x27;ve even taken it with me while travelling because of its size. I still recommend this mirror, but I do suggest you check out the bigger 8-inch mirror as well.fication side shattered. Three years later and it died. :( So sad.

    <li> I bought this for the magnification side mainly - it shows every little nook and cranny - just what I wanted ( I think )- love the fact you can hold it or set it down on surface - very happy with it - others I looked at did not have the magnification I was looking for :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she could not be happier!!! Great Mirror .( Makes my nose look huge! lol)</li>
    <li> With fading vision, I needed a mirror with magnification...so this Jerdon JP910NB mirror has filled the bill. The nickel finish looks lovely in my bathroom and I especially like the smaller base.  The table-top mirror I had before had a large base which took too much space. The beading around the edge of the magnifying side is attractive, too. I am so glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for me! Looks good quality.  I&#x27;m near-sighted so the 10x works well when I do make up without glasses. Love it.</li>
    <li> I was originally looking for a table top mirror that would fit on top of my vanity so that I could have a free standing mirror close enough to the edge of the counter so that I could do my eyeliner and this is the perfect size to do that!  It doesn&#x27;t take up very much counter space and I love the fact that it has a side with just a regular mirror and another side with the 10x magnification.  I don&#x27;t particularly like the magnification side though because I don&#x27;t particularly like seeing my pores the size of craters, but I can see where it would be useful.  The main thing is to not have the magnification side facing the window because you don&#x27;t know what kind of fire you may start.  Anyways, it is true to the size description, if you want a 6 inch diameter mirror, you will get one, but if you want something larger, look elsewhere.  Also... it looks really cute on my vanity.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a low price.  Heavyweight, expensive-looking, brushed nickel finish.  Mirrors on both side are clear and blemish-free.  I saw one in a retail store recently at almost double the price that didn&#x27;t come close to the quality of this item.</li>
    <li> I had a similar mirror on my vanity for many years and I was very upset when I knocked it off the counter and it broke. Nothing in stores came close so I looked at ebay and Amazon.  I found this right away and it was priced the same as the one I had. It&#x27;s not exactly the same, but it&#x27;s close enough and I&#x27;m happy again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom to match the rest of her bathroom items. She uses it all the time. She loves it.</li>
    <li> i got this for my mom, we were not sure whether to get 10x or 15x...should have gotten the 15x.&lt;br /&gt;the mirror is great looking, nice finish and it&#x27;s got some weight to it so it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to fall over.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re looking for a 10x</li>
    <li> There are a lot of these types of mirrors out there, so it&#x27;s hard to know which is best. Not only is this one attractive, it is well made.  I am very happy with the magnification side (10 x), it is not warped at all.  This product is excellent value for the money.</li>
    <li> This is very useful. I get tired of holding up a small magnifying mirror while tweezing, so the tiltable mirror on a stand is great!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite frightening to see your complexion magnified. Useful, but creepy.  Warning: the magnification can easily lead one to over-tweeze brows...</li>
    <li> I think this mirror works well for what it is.  I bought this mirror to pluck hairs on my neck and chin.  It has been rather helpful for the chin, but not helpful for the neck as if I position the mirror to point to my neck, my eyes cannot see in the mirror - perhaps a larger mirror might have worked better for my needs.</li>
    <li> The price is great! I wish there was internal lighting built in. Magnification isn&#x27;t bad either. I&#x27;ll have to pay a little more, but this mirror will definitely be utilized.</li>
    <li> A great vanity mirror with a nice finish. Fits your entire face in the mirror&#x27;s perimeter and has a great balance in the distribution of the weight at the bottom. Very satisfied with my buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this mirror to anyone who has problems putting on eye makeup. The mirror is very sturdy and it travels well cause its the appropriate size. I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mirror.  One side magnifies, the other is normal.  It functions as it should, what else is there to say?</li>
    <li> I gave this mirror to my wife for her birthday. She loves it. She really likes how it rotates 360 degrees, where the one she had did not.</li>
    <li> Nice magnifying mirror at a great price. Stand has nice finish. This is a great mirror for those up close make-up and grooming needs, especially for eyeglass wearers.</li>
    <li> Too small for me!  Should have paid attention to the size.</li>
    <li> This mirror was just what I needed.  It magnifies 10x and you are able to see everything..unfortunately...wrinkles..etc.  It is very sturdy and use it about everyday. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> What can I say...it works and it is the perfect size for a sit down makeup job...works perfectly for me.. small in size but is exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Big face is easy to make up! Nice and elegant.</li>
    <li> Very good Mirror I rally would say buy it great for putting on make up and you can take it from one room to another..</li>
    <li> Wonderful,... Was Plesantly Surprised.  VERY HAPPY. This is a Brushed Nickel Finish,.. the 10X Magnifier is a Big help putting Make up on as I wear Glasses and it allows me to look in the mirror and apply my Make up without my Glasses on. I am Very Happy, Came Boxed nicely.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror. It looks expensive and it&#x27;s functional. The only downfall is it does not have a light.</li>
    <li> This is great. I&#x27;d never had a vanity mirror before, but I bought it because I like to apply my makeup sitting at my desk rather than standing in my bathroom. The magnification is GREAT for tweezing - my eyebrows have never looked better. And the mirror itself is pretty elegant. This is a must for makeup/tweezing.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful mirror.  The brushed nickel is quality and looks beautiful in my bathroom.  I leave it sitting out on the counter since it matches all of my other fixtures perfectly.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to have it handy to grab for make-up or hair uses and I like that my female guests have access to the same. I recommend it as a quality display and functional item.</li>
    <li> I use this mirror everyday. Great sturdy mirror and good quality for the price. I use the regular side most often, the zoom side is a little intense for my liking but great for eye brow tweezing and finding blemishes on my face :)</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a 10 X magnify mirror for awhile. They are always so expensive. I&#x27;m so pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> This mirror was a great find.  It is not too bulky, quite attractive, and does what it is supposed to do.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> i agree with the favorable reviews. happy to have this, wanted something like what you find in most hotels. my bathroom lights are bright and if i really want to get down to business i shine my iPhone flashlight on my tweezable area.  wish so many other people would groom this well.</li>
    <li> I needed a simple and understated mirror for my vanity.  You can&#x27;t beat the price on this one!  It looks nice, though a little small, but worth it!</li>
    <li> I like this mirror.  The magnification is almost scary.  It shows every pore (and clogged pore!).  Just what I needed with my close-up vision getting worse with age. It&#x27;s easy to keep my brows groomed now. I checked out CVS and Target and for a similar product it was a little more expensive.  With the free shipping (over $25) it was a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> The larger 10x mirror is so much easier to use than the little travel size mirror.  It fits neatly on the vanity and looks very elegant.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this table-top mirror! I was looking for something to sit on my vanity table so I can do my makeup and this is perfect!! I wanted it small enough to not take up a lot of room but a good sized mirror so that I can see my entire face to do my makeup/ hair.&lt;br /&gt;The diameter of the base is 3.5\\&quot; (and has foam bottom), The mirror diameter is approximately 5.75\\&quot; and overall it stands 11\\&quot; high.&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty and feminine and has a weighted bottom so that it will be stable on the table/desk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has two sides- a &#x27;regular&#x27; mirror and then a &#x27;10X magnification&#x27; side.  I wasn&#x27;t really looking for magnification, just a regular mirror and I&#x27;ve noticed that when looking at the magnification side I need to move to be much closer to the mirror (which is standard) -but I mainly use the regular mirror side and it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Also, important to note that it turns from each side easily AND even better, it stays at the ANGLE you place it!! No drooping down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this mirror cannot be beat!! I am very happy with this mirror!!&lt;br /&gt;* Only disappointment with my specific mirror sent to me:  There is a small area in the front/bottom of the base that looks like it was scratched along asphalt or something.  It looks bad and like someone has scraped it - however, it&#x27;s not a big enough problem for me to go through the hassle of return/exchanging it. But it is a minor disappointment and blemish.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I totally recommend this table top mirror!!</li>
    <li> love the mirror, looks nice. only complaint is that the magnification side is very strong and can only be used close to the face, otherwise its blurry.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great, love the 10x! But, it&#x27;s really small compare to other table top mirrors. It&#x27;s great to take it and travel with you.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought but seems to be good quality, thanks!</li>
    <li> This item shipped very quickly and it was exact in description. I love this little mirror. It is perfect for makeup application and close ups of the face. Love that it is two sided.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mirror, but the mirrored surfaces could be a little  larger.  I like the 10x magnification for the fine work, but it&#x27;s when I&#x27;m using the regular magnification that I wish the mirror were larger.  The stand has an attractive light brushed silver finish.  I received a damaged stand with my first order, but that was quickly remedied by Amazon.  The packaging is not very secure for a product of this type.  Overall, I recommend this mirror, but it&#x27;s not an attractive gift as packaged.</li>
    <li> I just got my new mirror! Read the description before buying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting something else, even though it looks beautiful, it is so small. Just like 11-inches high and glides with a smooth rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt really like it</li>
    <li> As we age sometimes we cant see up close so good, this mirror is great for makeup, a must have and great quality.</li>
    <li> This IS the perfect mirror for make up. Nicely balanced/weighted, and  magnification.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I bought this one!  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> . . . buy this mirror!  But beware; are you sure you can handle seeing your face magnified ten times?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re right --- it&#x27;s better to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a frenzy of spring cleaning, I recently broke the 7X mirror I had bought in London ten years ago and depended on every day.  I was afraid that the Jerdon, at such a comparitively low price, couldnt possibly live up to it.  But one of the reviewers here said it was distortion-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were right; this mirror IS distortion free.  It is optically amazing.  Worth twice the money.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I originally got this magnifying mirror for applying makeup.  Since then, I have found it to be invaluable when tweezing my eyebrows.  I have NEVER done such a thorough, great job flossing my teeth until I got this mirror!  Even my dentist commented!   I love this mirror so much that I miss it when we are on vacation.  WARNING...It works so great that you can see every pore on your face and will get a lot fussier about applying and removing makeup.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror back in May and it is great.  The size is just right for displaying in the bathroom...not too big.  The magnified side is very clear.  The mirror is well made, base is heavy so it does not easily flip over, the frame is solid and well made, the mirror itself is strong.  My kids actually silently took it to play and ended up sleeping with it under their pillow.  When I found it the next day, I was glad to see that neither side had even a scratch on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have purchased at least 6 different magnifying mirrors over the years, they were OK but this mirror is the perfect height, perfect strength (for tweezing all those hairs that people over 40 can&#x27;t see) and it&#x27;s quite attractive. Of course the regular strength side is great too. The quality is excellent, very substantial, it has weight at the bottom so it won&#x27;t tip over.</li>
    <li> The mirror came in great condition. It was a little shorter than I preferred and 10x was a little much.   I returned it because I wanted a taller mirror &amp; changed my mind on 10x magnification. Other than that I recommend it! It was also too easy to return through Amazon, no problems there!</li>
    <li> It is good with both normal and magnificaiton sides</li>
    <li> very cute and good mirror. also very good quality. two sides,one is normal, another one can make make your face bigger....it is very clear to see my pore on it.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a magnification mirror that would help me see when I&#x27;d pluck my eyebrows and do my own lash extensions. I ordered this and their mini 15x mirror (for travel and extra magnification). This mirror fits perfectly. It sits nicely on my desk, sturdy, well made, and aside from having to adjust my chair for the right height I&#x27;m really happy with it. It takes a little time for my eyes to become familiar with the 10x but it&#x27;s well worth it to me. And, if you&#x27;re creative you can hang that little 15x from the top of the 10x rim or set it at the top of the base under the mirror rim. Bonus!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone who requested a table top mirror that had good magnification. This certainly fits the bill. It&#x27;s not the best quality. I mean, it&#x27;s not heavy metal or anything. But for the price, it does a great job. It is portable and does exactly what it says. Magnification is really good too.</li>
    <li> Use it daily. It is heavy and wouldn&#x27;t just topple over. Great to put on table and it looks elegant.</li>
    <li> Bought one and one more for my sister as a gift and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;This mirror doesn&#x27;t look cheap and I use every second since it&#x27;s on my desk.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror. It&#x27;s really good for the price and it&#x27;s not like a cheap product. Definitely worth it~</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is just beginning to experiment with makeup and loves this mirror. It&#x27;s sturdy and attractive and does the job!</li>
    <li> This is a great little mirror and the ten power mag side makes for real close up viewing of whatever you are looking at</li>
    <li> 10X is too much magnification. It is very blurry and does not help me. It is attractive and sturdy, I can use the regular mirror.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this mirror, it&#x27;s not cheaply made, nice and sturdy, and swivels easily if you want the magnified side.  At my age I need help seeing to put my makeup on.  The magnifier mirror is perfect, nice and clear.  I&#x27;ve priced these mirrors at a few stores and this is, indeed, a terrific price.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone wanting a nice two-sided tabletop mirror.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for contact lens removal. It was clear and worked out very well. If you need a close up mirror this ones for you.</li>
    <li> I researched a long time before getting this mirror for the bathroom.  The price is right and it&#x27;s the perfect size for doing my hair and tweezing eyebrows.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup but if it comes down to it I&#x27;ll just get a little lamp to use now and then when I need extra light.  The reflection is high quality and I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Wife who needed a replacement makeup mirror. We were both pleased with the quality.  It seems well made, with a nice finish and the optical quality of the mirrors is quite good.  I asked my Wife to help me with this review by telling me something she didn&#x27;t like about the mirror - and she couldn&#x27;t think of anything bad.  For under fifteen bucks on Amazon (and free shipping) you&#x27;d be hard pressed to beat this deal.</li>
    <li> This is a great looking table top hand mirror in a classy nickle finish.  It tilts for easy use and has a 10X magnification side that really makes your pores look like craters on the surface of the moon!  While I&#x27;m sure some might find this to be ideal, I find it distracting when I&#x27;m trying to use it to apply or fix eye makeup.  It would likely be great for those searching for fine hairs to pluck.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not spectacular like other reviews may lead you to believe, but it is very nice. The metal at the bottom is heavy and feels very sturdy. That said, it&#x27;s a 15 dollar mirror, so don&#x27;t expect anything too fancy. Which I wasn&#x27;t, so I was happy!</li>
    <li> I had originally been searching for a lighted magnifying mirror and actually bought this one by mistake. BUT I&#x27;m glad I did make that mistake! After already having bought this mirror and reading 50/50 reviews on lighted mirros, I changed the light bulbs in my bathroom - waa laa no need for lighted mirror anymore!. But the mirror itself is wonderful! It has 10x magnification which I was very happy about since I&#x27;m always doing facial treatments and like the magnification of seeing my pores. I&#x27;m near-sighted so doing my makeup from 2.5 ft away is still blurry without my glasses but the regular side is perfect for sitting it on the vanity and using my toilet as a chair and doing my makeup up close without leaning into the sink and straining my back. It&#x27;s also VERY lightweight which I was surprised about but still sturdy! I priced other vanity mirrors that were only 5x and they were in the $25 range so I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! It&#x27;s also very nice looking and looks great on my vanity!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a sturdy magnifying mirror at a great price, buy this one. I&#x27;ve spent so much time trying to figure out which one was the best.  I&#x27;ve read all reviews, both positive and negative.  I don&#x27;t have a negative thing to say about this mirror. Just go for it and don&#x27;t waste any more time. Seriously, it&#x27;s well worth the investment of $18. You can also adjust the angle of the mirror for hands free make-up application, plucking, etc. Unless you are the pickiest person on the planet, this will do just fine. It&#x27;s 10x magnifying appears to be spot on.  In fact,  I&#x27;ve been missing eyebrow hairs and am in need some serious plucking. I thought I had them all until I just looked in to this mirror.</li>
    <li> I have been using a lighted mirror bought from a cable shopping network for years.  It&#x27;s okay, but only has a mirror on one side and because it has an electric cord, it is not convenient to move from one room to another.  I read the positive reviews for this mirror and the price seemed very reasonable.  It arrived yesterday and I love it!  It&#x27;s is visually very attractive and it is nicely weighted (if you have a cat you will appreciate that aspect :).  I decided to put it on my desk in my home next to the window...maybe not a good idea!  The 10X mirror made me realize I need to pay more attention to my makeup routine!!  The other side also has wonderful clarity.  I am VERY pleased with this purchase and am going to buy another one to put in a guest bathroom. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Good price, well made product, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Can now see when I am plucking my eyebrows.  Sits nicely on my bathroom counter and looks good!</li>
    <li> I use this mirror every day to put on makeup, and I am very happy with its quality. I often flip from one side to the other and it holds its position no matter how it is turned or angled. The quality of reflection is very good.</li>
    <li> 5x mirror seemed like it was just like our regular bathroom mirror and the 10x mirror you had to get right in your face to focus.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror.  It&#x27;s the perfect size, well constructed.  It&#x27;s a shock to look into that 10x side!  But it really helps you see where the hairs are.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror.  Doesn&#x27;t wobble, and looks like a quality mirror. The magnification is good enough to see the details when putting on make up and such.</li>
    <li> I like the magnifying end of it real good. The build is solid too. It is not like some crummy ones I had used before.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see my face up close, now that I need reading glasses for everything.  Great for tweezing, and makeup.  Nicely made, and it just happens to match the finish of our bathroom fixtures.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself. But my mother has fallen in love with it and confiscated it! The 10x is amazing. We don&#x27;t have to worry about waiting for a sunny day to see if we missed a hair when plunking eyebrows. It also works great for spot concealing and eyelining just inside the lashes for that flawless line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only wish they would have continued the framework&#x27;s detailing along the 1x side of the mirror. It&#x27;s at present only on the 10x side and the base of the stand. It causes the mirror to look backwards when left on the 1x side after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still because of the 10x mirror and the love my mother has for the product I&#x27;m rating this with 5 stars! For those with 20/20 vision I&#x27;d say the 10x is a bit much. I personally have no problem with 8x, but don&#x27;t mind the 10x once my eyes adjust.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this mirror! I was looking for a mirror just like this to  put into my makeup room because the other small one that I did use just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me anymore.So I&#x27;m going to give my old mirror away to a friend that can use it.</li>
    <li> I was happy yesterday.  Then I used the Jerdon JP910NB mirror.  Why would anyone look into a 10x mirror!  The horrifying things I saw!  Stunned.  Shocked.  There should be a warning label!  No one should ever be subjected to such horrors.  I will now be purchasing facial scrubs, pore cleansers and wrinkle cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With age come bad eyes.  I suppose it&#x27;s nature&#x27;s way of preventing us from seeing how horrible old wrinkly skin is.  But,  I needed to put make-up on without my glasses and I was able to do so.  The mirror was small enough to put in my briefcase.  It seems sturdy enough.  It looks like it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I have the courage to ever look into it again though.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mirror for traveling.  It folds up and has a nice pouch to store it in.  The weight is not too heavy and easy to pack.  I like that it has two sides.  One regular mirror so I can hold up to another mirror to see the back of my head.  I have a really bad cowlick that I like to cover up.  The other side is great for putting on my make up.  I can&#x27;t see anything up close without readers.</li>
    <li> great mirror, good price, handy for travel.  the best thing is you can also buy the replacement bulbs on line.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product which is exactly as described.  I bought it to check portraits and head torso sculpts to looking for a pleasing asymmetric design.  I actually ended up buying two, since they are so reasonable and gave one to an artist friend.  The base is very heavy and the hardware very solid and tight.</li>
    <li> Great mirror with good quality!! I love it. I put it on my desk the only problem is that I can&#x27;t help but look at myself!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I see things on my face that I didn&#x27;t notice before! (Lol)  the magnification is very clear and precise.  In addition $20 bucks is a great price for beauty!</li>
    <li> It is well-built and works great on the table. You can tilt it and adjust to whatever angle you want and it stays perfectly. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Good quality throughout.  The 10 times magnification is perfect for really close up work.  If there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;d change, I&#x27;d get one slightly larger.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror specifically for the combination of 10x magnification in a larger size (can&#x27;t see close up any more after lasik correction to improve distance vision). This mirror fit the bill perfectly. Like the 10x magnification better than my 4x magnification even though the 4x is a lighted mirror. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It looks very cute standing on my dressing table! I really like the nickel finish and the detailed decorations on the base of this mirror. The adjustable angle of it helps a lot when I put on my makeup. Love it!</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought it would be.Not the best, but good price...Smaller than expected. I would look for a product similar to this in person.</li>
    <li> This mirror is hefty, all metal, and conveys a sense of durability.  After messing around with cheaper mirrors that were flimsy out of the box and ready to break, this is like finding something made in the &#x27;olden days&#x27; before everything turned into Chinese garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will prove worthy of my praise and still be in my life many years from now.</li>
    <li> Perfect for difficult vision. I can see up close now to do eyebrows easily. I wish a 12 inch mirror like this was available. I&#x27;d buy it.</li>
    <li> Nice little mirror. The magnified side is curved and the other inside is flat. The magnified side has a beaded trim around the mirror edge.  Works well and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room or look bad left on bathroom counter. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very sturdy and that&#x27;s the main thing I like about it.  My old mirror was always getting loose and I had to tighten it all the time.  This mirror is very well built and worth the money.</li>
    <li> It magnifies so large it&#x27;s scary to look at yourself.  Handy stand leaves both your hands free to work on whatever you magnify.</li>
    <li> I broke my last magnifying mirror. After a long search, I decided on this one. The size is good because it fits anywhere. The magnification is awesome.</li>
    <li> The item was shipped and arrived as scheduled!  It was exactly as it was stated.  It is the perfect size.  Just wish the magnifying mirror was more powerful but it will work.  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> uMMM...WHAT CAN I SAY, ITS A MIRROR. ITS VERY CUTE. I WOULD HAVE GAVE IT 5 STARS BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BIGGER. ITS QUITE SMALL, BUT OH WELL IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after seeing the other great reviews.  They didn&#x27;t lie!  This mirror is pretty awesome.  It&#x27;s sturdy, pretty large (considering I want it for makeup purposes), and has a really really clear image.  I am ecstatic about this purchase.  I may buy a second one for work!</li>
    <li> Finally can see ll the little hairs. I admit I have a slight obsession with getting them all now! Perfect for dark haired women looking to get rid of unwanted facial hair without waxing.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the exact same mirror 5 or so years ago.  My space called for a smaller base and this one fit the bill perfectly.  Did not know after breaking the first one that this one was a duplicate but what a happy surprise.</li>
    <li> The silver matches my other bathroom fixtures perfect.  The mirror work as I needed.  Don&#x27;t always like what I see but the mirror is good.</li>
    <li> This is just right for my dressing area to put on my makeup.  I recommend it.  Easy to pack for trips.</li>
    <li> Rusted all over. After just 45 day in a dry California home this Jerdon mirror rusted over. It must be poor quality steel that is painted a shiny finish, no choice but to throw it away as it also has a bad rust smell. Amazon should really refund and stop selling this.</li>
    <li> Works real well when you can&#x27;t see to put on makeup without your glasses. Also great to pluck those unwanted hairs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to be used mainly for plucking my eyebrows. But for several times I used the magnified side, I felt dizzy so I just used the standard side.</li>
    <li> I purchase this little mirror before, but when I moved, it went into storage.  I travel a great deal because of work and recently moved again.  I needed a mirror and with mine in storage, well, I decided to get this once again.  It&#x27;s a great vanity piece.  It&#x27;s well made, quality is great, felt at the bottom to protect your surfaces, and the magnified side ensures I get every single pesky stray brow hair out!  At under 20 bucks, the price is excellent, and in my mind, definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Mirror was much smaller in diameter than I expected.  Should&#x27;ve measured.  Otherwise, good quality and powerful mirror.  Perfect for tweezing eyebrows.</li>
    <li> The mirror was too small for me to be able to fully utilize it, otherwise, it was as expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> It was better than I thought. Probably too good. I see things I didn&#x27;t to see. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I like it. I would go for the next size up (8-inch) next time.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror my mom had one that lit up but the cord was annoying this is easy to move around and has the regular and the magnified side works great for plucky my eyebrows</li>
    <li> You can find these mirrors at lots of places for 2 to 3 times the price. This is an excellent value, the image quality of 10X is great, it has a nice appearance and finish, and you can move it around anywhere. I&#x27;d buy one again and I can recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror to use when putting on my make-up in our travel trailer.  I absolutely love it.  It is clear and weighted well so it does not tip easily.  The mirror slants so I can adjust it to suite my needs and it takes up little space.  With a 10X magnification, it really helps in the application of make-up.  Very good price, too.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror a lot. It is very clear and very practical for makeup application. I use it everyday for 2 years! One side of the mirror is really zoomed in and I can see everything! Both sides are very clear. I would recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> It looks nice but when I looked at my face in the mirror, it&#x27;s obviously shorter and wider compared with other mirrors and cameras! I wonder if it&#x27;s still available to return it now. Why do I need a mirror which can&#x27;t reflect the real shape of my face?! It&#x27;s so weird every time I look into it!</li>
    <li> Well made and sturdy mirror. The regular side as well as the magnification side are both of quality glass. I love using both side as I take care of my personal grooming and the clear reflection in the mirror is much appreciated. This is NOT made of cheap materials.</li>
    <li> Spent far too long \\&quot;researching\\&quot; which mirror to buy; this one was comparatively inexpensive and it works great. 10x magnification is not so intense as it sounds.</li>
    <li> I received the mirror and i was a little disappointed not good i guess at judging sizes wanted it taller and the pretty side with design is on the mag side, think it should show on the regular mirror, just ok</li>
    <li> Excellent product and very inexpensive !&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this mirror for a long time now and is still like the first day I got it.&lt;br /&gt;Incredible quality at an unbelievable price. I have been shopping the prices in stores and nothing comes even close.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it with no fear.</li>
    <li> Nicely made, no distortion.</li>
    <li> I expected more from this mirror.  It wasn&#x27;t as large as I expected (yes, I know I read the dimensions, but it seemed smaller still).  Also, the large magnifying side was too big- you can&#x27;t focus on it.</li>
    <li> This was a bit of a let down buy. The base is small and is easily tipped over and the 10x magnifier is too strong to see unless you hold it right up to your face. Also the mirrors are a little loose in the frame casing so I am worried about it breaking. I wish I would have sent it back. My mistake.</li>
    <li> i am in love with this mirror. i would recommend this to anybody who hate to go into the bathroom and look really close to do their eyeliner lml. ever since i got this mirror i do my makeup right in my room and the best part about it is the 10x magnification . now i can do my eye brows perfect . loveeee this</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror and true to description.</li>
    <li> The base of the mirror has a tear in it.  There is red marker lines on the top of the base.  I ordered it, thinking I would be getting a perfect mirror, not a damaged one.  I wrote a note and sent a picture of the damaged bottom last week, but as yet, have had no response.  I would return it, for one in new condition, but I&#x27;m not able to get to the post office. The mirror itself is great.  Please advise.  Thank You.  Beth</li>
    <li> Same type of mirror I remember my mom having as a kid.  Great for closeups of putting on makeup or for checking facial blemishes.</li>
    <li> Magnifies beautifully</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the magnification but this is a great mirror, and my mother loves hers just as I do!</li>
    <li> This is a substantial well weighted good looking very functional mirror.  I would recommend to anyone looking for such a critter.</li>
    <li> I bought a dressing table and mirror and needed a small mirror for the table for detailed makeup applications. This mirror aides in my mission but I wish for the price it was lighted.</li>
    <li> I had a tall, flexible neck two-sided mirror for years, but it was falling apart.  I bought this one and am very pleased. It is wide enough (6 or 7 inches) in diameter to see well for makeup.  It has a very solid, quality feel.  The mirrors are very clear, no distortion.  Even though it is one of the taller models, it is not tall enough when I put on makeup.  I have a paper towel holder with a flat top and set it on that when using it, then set it on the counter when not.  (Don&#x27;t want to knock it off.)  I didn&#x27;t want to use it for travel due to weight and not wanting to chance damage to it.  I bought the Rucci Clear Vanity Mirror for travel and am happy with both purchases.</li>
    <li> Looks very high quality. Has been good but started to show signs of rust around the base close to a year after we got it.This is just from being in the bathroom and being subject to steam.</li>
    <li> Great mirror.  Small enough for bathroom vanity and it packs a great magnifying side for those of us who can&#x27;t see close up so well.&lt;br /&gt;You will love it.</li>
    <li> I dont think the other side of the mirror is 10x but still its a very good deal! I do suggest.</li>
    <li> It says it is 10X maginifying, but maybe they just don&#x27;t make them powerful enough.  My mother gave me a mirror similar to this, in the 60&#x27;s.  Over the years the frame fell apart, it was plastic.  I only kept the magnifying side, and it is more powerful than any I have seen.</li>
    <li> Sent with girls off to college. They&#x27;re very happy with it. Perfect for make up and putting earring in. Not too tippy.</li>
    <li> Works well for me. I am disabled so I needed something that I could use at a table while I sat. This is ideal for my needs.</li>
    <li> I noticed that only one side of the mirror is functional. Normal view works fine; but the magnified side is unusable. It has a warped view and is impossible to use. I didn&#x27;t notice this item was defective since I purchased the item b/c i don&#x27;t normally use the magnified view. If I&#x27;ve known this sooner and still had the box, i would have returned the item.</li>
    <li> The 10X side was so blurry that neither myself or my mother could make out much in it.  Would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror at BB&amp;B loved it, then dropped it. Thank goodness Amazon had a replacement. Love this mirror</li>
    <li> Needed to be able to sit and do make up. I don&#x27;t have much time to use it, but it is convenient thing to have.</li>
    <li> Ok, the Mirror is fine, the X&#x27;s 10 is great but the stand I&#x27;m not happy with. When I opened the box, the bottom that is glued to the base wasn&#x27;t glued well. ALSO the main problem is that the base has a place that looks rusted. The base is sturdy and looks fine until I turned it around and there is a place on the round part at the bottom base that has a place on the silver that is about 1/2 by 2 inches long. I thought it was glue, but found it is rust, to the point that it is slightly pitted. I am not sending it back but this would have gotten 5 stars had the base been in good condition.</li>
    <li> The mirror is very good quality and is just what I expected.  I&#x27;m giving another one as a gift.  I would recommend this mirror to others.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, lovely design, especially for the price. It works very well - good quality magnification. But, I do miss being able to adjust the height of the mirror to my head/counter height as I did in my last mirror (which cost 2x as much :)).</li>
    <li> I HATE DOING THIS SURVEY AND RESENT IT BEING SENT. iF I WERE NOT HAPPY WITH THEM i WOULD HAVE LET YOU KNOW.</li>
    <li> I thought this is the kind hat has lights, but its a smaller version&lt;br /&gt;its easier to store, and the mirror is super clear, but i just have to clean it very often&lt;br /&gt;its movable, and goes very well with my busy dorm life!</li>
    <li> It is a very nice looking mirror and I love the height would buy another one in a minute maybe for another gift.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a great inexpensive 10x and regular mirror. Great for traveling or getting ready outside of a bathroom or room with loads of mirrors.</li>
    <li> My wife returned this one for a number of reasons. 1) The magnification was far too intense. 2) There is a warpage in the glass--an exaggerated curvature--that makes actually seeing yourself an aggravation. Our reaction was that, although well built, this mirror could not have been tested on real humans before being released for sale. Avoid it unless you can try in person first.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as it appears in the pictures.  It is attractive, sturdy and stable and provides the required magnification.  The mirror tilts and holds its position as placed.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed it was not quite as pictured, and I know it&#x27;s extremely picky of me, but I expected the beveled nickel finish on both sides and it&#x27;s only on the 10x magnifying side. It would look so nice on the other as well. Not a big enough deal to return it, but it doesn&#x27;t show that in the pictures.</li>
    <li> This one is my fault.  It is frustrating when you search for &#x27;lighted&#x27; mirror you get other mirrors also.  I was looking for a large magnification which this one has but it is not lighted.  I will not be able to use it.</li>
    <li> I had a brass-toned mirror just like it, with  6X magnification, which I liked.  Unfortunately, my 3 1/2 year old mirror deteriorated at the base and I had to throw it out.  I do not like the 10X magnification. Otherwise, I am satisfied with the mirror.</li>
    <li> Its 10x magnification mirror is perfect to assist with eyebrow plucking and shaping, and I have also found myself regularly checking my blemishes for any sign of change. This is a solid and sturdy mirror but is also lightweight enough to be able to hold it for lengthy amounts of time (I use it to reflect against another mirror to assist with trimming my hair).</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE 10X TO MAKE IT EASIER TO SEE EVERYTHING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to handle, and carry!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> A little small but good magnification without distortion. Brushed nickle. Pretty base and detail.  A good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror, although I should&#x27;ve taken more time to read that it was only 6&amp;#34; in diameter. Although I would&#x27;ve preferred at least an 8&amp;#34; diameter, this mirror does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars only because the 10X magnification is just too much. It&#x27;s like trying to watch TV with your face pressed up against the screen. Ended up returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design quality is great...feels well-made. Base is solid and won&#x27;t tip over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might like it better than we did. Nice mirror, but just not right for our casa.</li>
    <li> This was gift and it was just as described. It came in its original box and was just the right amount of magnification. It&#x27;s pretty much being used to pluck brows and do intricate make up. It also matches the decor in the bathroom just right!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and sturdy and serves my purposes perfectly.  It has a nice heavy bottom so it doesn&#x27;t tip over .</li>
    <li> The price is OK, the quality is high, you want it, get it.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it and got what I expected, thanks</li>
    <li> Other than the fact mine arrived cracked and I can&#x27;t be bothered to go through the return/exchange process (not the product&#x27;s fault!), this is a nice mirror. It&#x27;s your standard regular/magnified makeup table mirror and it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for doing my make-up in the mornings.  I have terrible light in my bathroom so I do my make-up in my dining room, hah.  This mirror is a nice size and seems very durable.  It is perfect for my purposes and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror at a great price!   I would buy this again</li>
    <li> I knocked my old mirror off the vanity with my elbow onto a tile floor, and that was the end of it!  I had no idea what strength the magnification was, so I didn&#x27;t know what to replace it with! I wear reading glasses so I was having a terrible time putting on makeup. Every woman knows you can&#x27;t wear glasses to put on eye makeup!! I searched through the inventory of stores like Target and Walmart, but the best I could find was a 5x or 7x at a cost of $30-$75. I still couldn&#x27;t see well enough out of any of them for eyebrow plucking. I read a helpful review that was encouraging about getting a 10x, so I hope this helps someone else choose this product.  I wanted to share that this mirror is exactly what I needed! I can SEE clearly! It&#x27;s great in bathroom light and in natural light too. I was hesitant because this was the lowest priced mirror I found online, and I was afraid the quality wouldn&#x27;t be there. This is the best quality mirror at any price, and there are no distortions.  It&#x27;s much better and actually bigger than my old mirror. It turns easily without being stiff, but stays at the angle where you put it...No loose swiveling. I actually had a metal clamp that I used as a weight on my old mirror to keep it in place!  Duh, besides fracturing it, ya think I needed a new mirror? No need to hesitate on this one...It&#x27;s a great buy, looks good, and you&#x27;ll see every pore on your face. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, this is a 10 star mirror!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror as a gift for my sister who recently turned fifty (kind of a joke thing) but seriously, I use this 10x mirror myself to see what young ppl see that I can&#x27;t anymore. Ha! This is a fantastic value for $20.00, I paid $40.00 at Ulta for the same product while I was still in my 40 somethings and quickly realized that a 8x didn&#x27;t any longer cut it. 10x mirrors are hard to find especially for this price AND my makeup looks perfect.</li>
    <li> Need to get very close to prevent blur.  A little stong for a distance away from mirror, may consider 7X as 5X is not quite right and 10X too strong.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my wife to replace an older worn out model. She has complimented on the 10X power many times and is so pleased with this new mirror.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on reviews alone....I am very grateful I did...Was going to purchase a cheaply made off brand....You get what you pay for with one....QUALITY....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you fellow reviewers....Thank you seller!!!</li>
    <li> Even though this is a nice mirror, it looks pretty on my vanity, for those of us who need to help seeing, this is not a true 10X mirror.  More like a 3x.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product, sturdy and well-built, but a bit smaller than I would have liked. The 10x side definitely gives you all the close up action you could possibly need, though. Over all it&#x27;s a good mirror, but wouldn&#x27;t mind it being a bit bigger as I planned on using it as my primary mirror to do my grooming in.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, she loves it. Uses it all the time. She does her makeup with it and likes how magnifying one side is.</li>
    <li> I can no longer see fine details, so I use this daily to apply make up and contacts. It is also attractive. The 10 x magnification is more than I expected. I think I may go with something a little less next time.</li>
    <li> great little mirror for the money.  the mirror was clear without flaws and the finish on the mirror is very nice!</li>
    <li> My wife really likes the mirror for doing her makeup fast and easy.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I am looking for.  Very sturdy.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very nice. Heavy metal (not cheaply made), with a good mirror and a nice size. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for to keep on top of my desk for quick, easy makeup refreshing.</li>
    <li> great magnification.  Good value for the price.  Nice compact size that sits on the counter without taking up much space</li>
    <li> This mirror worked well initially, but overtime the bottom started to distort, causing it to wobble. The stem also started to loosen quite a bit so now it leans to one side. I replaced it with a bigger one that is more durable and less expensive. I would not recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> My husband had purchased another mirror which I did not like so I went online to find another one...this is very nice - good size, easy to flip, cleans quickly, and does the job.  Nice detailing for the price!</li>
    <li> The mirror I received was very nicely made and had none of the issues noted by other reviewers.  It was attractive with no defects right out of the box.  No rust, and put together perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both sides of the mirror are crystal clear.  Any magnifying mirror will seem blurry until you are at the right distance, which will vary from person to person.  At the right point, the magnified side was perfectly clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beaded border is very pretty around the edges of the mirror.  My only suggestion would be to put the beads on both sides of the mirror.  Currently, the beads are only on the magnified side.  When leaving the mirror on display, the magnified side looks blurry from a distance.  It would look much prettier to leave the regular side on display, but that side doesn&#x27;t have the beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 10x magnification may actually be too strong for some people.  Unless your eyes are very weak,  3x magnification actually works better for most purposes.  10 x is best for serious examination of a single area.  3 x is better for general viewing.</li>
    <li> Hands down this it the best I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure to own.  Lightweight, good quality and looks lovely to boot.</li>
    <li> I like that it does not have a light to plug in which makes it easy to use any where</li>
    <li> Purchased this mirror for my mother-in-law and she loves it. Excellent quality at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> My wife and niece both have one of these.  They are very happy with it and it&#x27;s sturdy, a nice size, and well made.    Remember to heed the included warning to NOT face the 10x side out where it might reflect the sunlight coming in as it could start a fire somewhere.

    <li> While vanity mirrors can be pricy, this one is decently priced for good quality. Is heavier and seems sturdier. Accidentally dropped it when I first got it, but didn&#x27;t break. Overall Happy.</li>
    <li> I am so surprised and happy with the quality of this mirror that I am in the process of buying a couple more as gifts for my mother and best friend.  This is a really good mirror, additionally, please know that although it only 6\\&quot; in circumference, you can see your entire face at one time making makeup application easy and flawless.  Also, the 10X magnification side is awesome for plucking eyebrows and for eyeliner &amp; mascara application.      I hope all makeup wearers have a mirror like this one.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I wanted a good magnification mirror, at least 10X ~ and did not want to spend a small fortune on one. Locally, these have been nearly impossible to find with anything even half acceptable going for $40-$50 and up.    I have had others with plastic holders, the most recent one with a small plastic base and light (the light which was useless and which we never used) by Floxite that had a maddening concave shape, was also top heavy and finally bit the dust (and I had paid $30 for that one!). So I had also hoped to find one which was hands-free and yet one which I did not have to hook to the wall ~ or use suction cups on my regular mirror. I had fully expected to pay $50 or more for any type of decent one!    This mirror is fantastic and especially for the price. I read all the reviews here and it is indeed a Five-Star purchase. It&#x27;s base is heavy enough that there is no fear of toppling, it does not need \\&quot;installed\\&quot; or \\&quot;suction cupped\\&quot; anywhere. Portability is a plus as I like regular sunlight to see what I am doing. And yes, despite the size, you can easily see your entire face in it. When you adjust it, it stays where you put it and does not slip at all.    There is no distortion in the mirror at all, something I have found you really have to watch in mirrors which are less expensive. The base has a non-scratch surface so it can be placed anywhere without fear of damage.     And it is eligible for Free SuperSaver Shipping, which makes a great deal an even better one! Amazon had it here on the day they fisrt estimated it would ship. It also comes in a nice box, great for transporting and which I saved as we will be moving in the next month or so ~ and I will not have to worry about it being broken. You can purchase a more expensive mirror, but in the 10X maginification, you cannot get a better quality mirror in this size. I am considering purchasing a second one as well.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this cosmetics mirror.  Although it&#x27;s not lighted, it is very portable.  That comes in handy since we have a little girl and my wife often needs to take this mirror into another room.</li>
    <li> I must say that I was not expecting a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; mirror, but I got one!  The mag 10X IS worth the price.  I am grateful to have a mirror that is actually useful!</li>
    <li> All in all, it serves its purpose and does what it was intended to do - help locate chin whiskers and crumbs in my mustache. It serves its purpose but can be hard to navigate sometimes due to the distortion around the edges. This creates a little bit of an issue for me personally because it&#x27;s embarrassing to go out with hair from the previous nights encounters still stuck to my face.     I would recommend looking for one with lights because sometimes it can be hard to see to pop my huge pimples that I get due to \\&quot;the change\\&quot;. My condition usually leaves me feeling a little cantankerous and standing in my bathroom trying to pop a pimple for hours only makes it worse. I might still have a good relationship with my family and my now ex-husband had I bought one with lights.     I would reccomend this one to anyone on a fixed income or ballin on a budget and can&#x27;t afford to spend dollars on a fancier one with lights. If you are going through \\&quot;the change\\&quot; and still want to be married in 6 months, this one is not for you. If your husband is a jerk though, this will definitely aid in speeding up the divorce and will MUCH cheaper than having to go to counseling.</li>
    <li> Excellent product..EXCELLENT PRICE</li>
    <li> I searched several discount retail stores and most mirrors similar to this one was between $30 - $50.  When I saw this one on Amazon I ordered it immediately!  It&#x27;s a nice mirror, not too heavy, and smaller so it fits well in the bathroom without taking up too much space.</li>
    <li> Very loverly, works great.</li>
    <li> Good quality exactly like description.  Its a sturdy mirror and the magnifying side is just perfect for applying makeup and tweezing eyebrows</li>
    <li> It reflects. It looks like it does in the picture. It shipped quickly. It&#x27;s a mirror. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This mirror is small! I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as tiny as it is. I can&#x27;t see my entire face at once when looking in it close up, which is of course, its purpose. Nevertheless, it looks nice and has a fine finish. The magnifier side, is too harsh so I only use the regular side when putting on make up or plucking my eyebrows. I wish I had gotten a bigger mirror.</li>
    <li> It does the job well as a mirror. but the built quality is just a little poor. you can see gaps and etc.</li>
    <li> It is nice to be able to see up close.</li>
    <li> it works great, highly  usable it is nice great stand etc ,love it!!!!! great great great, wow wow wow,A plus</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured.  This is a very nice table top mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror is adequate - nothing special to rave about.  I need another one that&#x27;s not quite so magnified for make up application.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister.</li>
    <li> My husband broke my mirror. It was this identical mirror. I am buying the same one because I like the magnification. It is great for doing my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> The mirror looks nice, but it&#x27;s not as strong as some of my 5X mirrors.  I have 2 small 10X mirrors, &amp; about 5,  5X mirrors, 4 out of 5 were stronger than this one. I would send it back, but I broke up the box before I checked it.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect dressing table mirror. I have a big mirror on the wall at my dressing table but have found as I get older that it is not so easy to see my makeup application well using it.  This mirror is a great aid. Light but stable, simple clean design, and good mirror.  The 10x magnification is a LOT, and I find I use the non-magnified side mostly - possibly I could have selected a mirror with less magnification.  I searched locally for such a mirror and did not find anything this nice and simple for any price.</li>
    <li> Good quality mirror. Magnification is clear.</li>
    <li> I use this for make up and it is good size for traveling, too. It is large enough to see plenty of my face for make up, not so small that i can only see 1 eye.</li>
    <li> Looks nice on my bathroom sink, perfect size, sturdy good quality. I would recommend it, not very much more to say</li>
    <li> Great magnifying mirror!!</li>
    <li> Really great quality mirror I&#x27;ve had it for a while no wear.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a small mirror to help with shaving for over a year. I did not want one that was big and bulky - my counters in the bathroom are small enough is it is. I also wanted one that had an elegant look, did not hook up to power (no need for it myself) and was light weight. I looked at ones at Costco that had 10x mag that had blurry images; however, this Jerdon model has very clear 10x mag that allows for a perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also came in handy to remove a stuck contact lens. This is a wonderful mirror that I am very glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> Very good mirror for the price.  Stands well, good weight and the magnification is very helpful.</li>
    <li> the only reason it does not get the fifth star is that i can&#x27;t travel with it- too heavy for travel.  but otherwise i love it.</li>
    <li> This 10x mirror has no distortion. Quality viewing of mirrors five times the price....I will be buying this product as &#x27;girl gifts&#x27; too. Very reasonably priced for quality.</li>
    <li> The 10x side was impossible to use. Also, for myself, I was imagining a larger mirror - I should have checked the dimensions. I want to be able to see my face as well as hair etc when using it. Having to hunch over to see what I am doing is not what I want. Regular side of mirror is ok.</li>
    <li> such a wonderful mirror</li>
    <li> It has a swivel, with a regular mirror on one side and a magnifying mirror on the other    I use it for plucking, mostly, and it&#x27;s great for this!  The ability to swivel is important because I like to see how I look in natural daylight, but the darn sun moves around, so it&#x27;s great to be able to position the mirror so that the shadows are minimized!    It&#x27;s heavy - not too heavy - but it has a nice, solid feel -- well made!    Updating my review -- I still like the mirror, but I want to warn people not to leave it by a sunny window!      I left it on a table by a window, with the magnifying side facing the window and my cat was sitting between the mirror and the window while I was chatting on the phone and, all of a sudden, thick white smoke started coming off my cat(!!!) Apparently the sun bounced off the magnifying glass, hit my cat, and started a fire!      She&#x27;s totally fine - as soon as I saw it, I patted out the fire and, aside from being really pissed off, the cat was fine :)  But... I can only imagine that if it could set my cat on fire, it could do the same to drapes, tablecloths, etc, so please don&#x27;t leave this mirror in sunlight!!</li>
    <li> For tweezing. How I ever got away without it I shudder to think. It&#x27;s a good mirror. Seems to be quality.</li>
    <li> Perfect size.  Doesn&#x27;t over whelm my bathroom vanity.  I got this one to replace a bigger magnifying mirror.  Bottom has felt on it, so it won&#x27;t scratch the counter surface or rust.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this mirror....just the right height for makeup, curling hair, and 10x is perfect for the 60+ generation who don&#x27;t see very well any more....even with glasses.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great, or is it, as you see things on your face you never saw before using it. I&#x27;m glad we purchased it, as i am more confident after putting on make-up. You see hair growing in areas on your face and chin you could not see before lol!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Jerdon for your good product, and price!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror so that I can have a small mirror for pageants and dressing rooms that are sometimes crowded.</li>
    <li> This mirror really needs light--plain and simple.  THe magnification is fine, but it needs to be lighted.  It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is great for close-up (I use it for my eyebrows). High quality and looks nice sitting on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> This is great.  Magnification is good.  Fits well on bathroom sink, doesn&#x27;t take up much room.  Cleans up well and is all I could ask for.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> loved, still have it in my bathroom</li>
    <li> Nice little mirror for my morning.</li>
    <li> It gets dusty very easily but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the product&#x27;s fault. I use it everyday on my desk and it does exactly what it needs to do which is show my reflection.</li>
    <li> Great product for daily use.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. I have to get the light just right t see the magnification without blurring but it&#x27;s lovely and works well for plucking chin hairs, flossing, etc.</li>
    <li> Has a nice heavy base and good quality mirrors.</li>
    <li> its very small! AND ITS CROOKED!!! IT MAKE THINGS LOOK WIDER THAN THEY ACTUALLY ARE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;it has a lot of good reviews and thats why i got it but tbh its not worth it!</li>
    <li> Heavy...good quality and exactly what I needed to do my makeup on my vanity!</li>
    <li> I think I would have liked a little stronger magnification and larger mirror. But this is OK. Sturdy...</li>
    <li> I thought it had a light, but I was wrong.  Even though I really wanted the light, this mirror was too nice to send back.  I really like it.  Simply, feminine and does the job!</li>
    <li> First of all, This product came within the exspected delivery date, which is a plus for me. Second, the product was exactly like the picture and was everything positive like the other reviews I read. It&#x27;s not so bulky or big which I am very happy about since my makeup vanity is not big. The size is 6&amp;#34; Diameter and the mirror swivels 360 degrees. I love the nickel beaded finished. I also love the 10x magnification for when I pluck my eyebrow. Great price for this mirror as well! I&#x27;m Very Happy!</li>
    <li> This is a nice nickel-look mirror. It is adjustable and has protection on the bottom that prevents from sliding or scratching furniture surface.</li>
    <li> I took the measurements into account when I ordered it, but it turned out to be smaller than ideal size. The six inch magnifying side gives about 2&amp;#34; of clear usable viewing area, due to the extreme curvature of the glass that distorts the reflection except in the very center. It&#x27;s also too short to use comfortably while seated without hunching over. I still have to prop it up on something. But it is heavy and sturdy and of good construction.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom, she is enjoying using it very much.  It is very nice.</li>
    <li> Did the job extremely well.  No light but works well.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a piece of junk - do not buy it.  The foam pad is only attached to the mirror base for about an eighth of the circumference.  The rest of the foam pad is popped out of the base and cannot be pushed back in.  The regular side of the mirror is okay but the reflection from the 10X magnifying side is horribly distorted unless you get to within 3 inches of the mirror, which would make it somewhat impractical for any use I can imagine for a magnifying mirror. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great.  Magnification on one side and regular mirror on the other.  Base is nice and heavy so it doesn&#x27;t tip over like cheaper models.  Looks nice sitting on the bathroom counter.  Would suggest this to anyone looking for a pretty looking makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> I put off having a good vanity mirror for so long and not that I have one I can&#x27;t understand why I hesitated.  This mirror is free of distortion (wish it wasn&#x27;t ;-) ) and the 10x magnifier is wayyyy to honest. Good choice, good looking in the nickle finish and good price.</li>
    <li> I had my sister buy this for me for my birthday. I&#x27;m amazed at how much I like it. The magnification is terrific (which can be good or bad!). I can&#x27;t see a thing without my glasses so putting on makeup, doing my eyebrows, etc. is difficult without a magnifying mirror. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my make-up area.  I have a large mirror but this is perfect for up close and fits pefect on the table.  No light though.</li>
    <li> I returned this mirror as I found that 10X magnification was just too intense.  It seems like nice quality, but when I ordered it, I didn&#x27;t know how much 10X actually showed.  I wish it was offered in a 5X magnification which should be perfect.</li>
    <li> Love it very much, especially the amplifying mirror, clear and useful ! This mirror is also very strong and not easy to be broken.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very pretty and looks nice sitting on the vanity.  I half way wish that I had gotten one with a light but this one works fine in a room with a good overhead or over the sink light!</li>
    <li> I like the mirror but it seems awfully big. For someone who wants it to sit on a counter and use it without lifting it will work well for you. I like lifting a mirror closer for some make-up applications and this feels big and heavy in my hand.</li>
    <li> This mirror lasted me a good year before one of the sides gave out, it&#x27;s not completely broken it just pops out than I have to be real careful the move it or else it pops right back out. I just bought a new one it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle. The magnification is great to see your pores and to pluck your eyebrows. Pretty good mirror for the price. Did survive a couple falls too without shattering.</li>
    <li> I know that sounds unusual but it&#x27;s true.  With my 7x magnifying mirror... I could see most of my face in the mirror.  This mirror magnifies so much that you can barely see your whole eye... so not good for makeup.  But it does work great for tweezing!!</li>
    <li> It is a great mirror I use to pluck my eyebrows and look at something more closely. I also use it as a regular mirroras well as the magnified mirror. I&#x27;m suprised and happy it didn&#x27;t crack when I dropped it. I was sure it was going to break.</li>
    <li> I WISH IT WAS BIGGER BUT IT WORKS,   MAKES GETTING CONTACTS IN MUCH EASIER OR SEEING THOSE HUGE EYEBROWS YOU MISSED IN A REGULAR MIRROR</li>
    <li> The size is a little small, but perfectly acceptable for me.  The construction is solid and it feels well made.  The mirror itself is clear and has a nice finish.  My only complaint is that the magnifying side isn&#x27;t perfectly shaped.  There is a sort of large bubble or dent that causes the reflection to be distorted in one spot in the upper right portion of the mirror.  It&#x27;s not too bad, so I won&#x27;t return it, but I&#x27;m sure some people would consider it unacceptable and demand a replacement.</li>
    <li> This mirror came and my first thought was that it was smaller than I had imagined....then I looked at the 10x side and, voila! I saw EVERY pore as clear as day - without any cheater-peeper glasses!!! I quickly got over the smallness and took it right up to the bathroom where I saw it took up much LESS counter space than my other hand one but the mirror was the same size as the one I had....nice beading details on the edges too. I am ordering another one for my south home....Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am happy to have made this purchase. The mirror stand has a heavy bottom and the magnifying side is that sometimes difficult to find \\&quot;10x\\&quot; which I require. It&#x27;s the only mirror I need to do my hair, make-up and whatever. It also comes in a sturdy enough box that can and should be used for storage. (the manufacturer even reminds you that a mirror sitting out can cause a fire under certain unlucky conditions). It does come from China unfortunately, but is well made and a good value.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it very much</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.  It is not lighted and hard to use.  Purchase the Floxite 10x Daylight Cosmetic mirror instead !!</li>
    <li> 1 star.... because it came broken... 4 Stars because I fixed it......&lt;br /&gt;Its small than what I expected. Gives little cheap look. But 10X magnification is really good.</li>
    <li> Other side upside down. But it still works.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. EXCELLENT. !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the mirror, good for putting on makeup and plucking those unwanted hairs. I wish I would have gotten a 15 or 20x. I might be buying another one in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good size and sits perfectly on the counter without taking up too much room.  The 10x magnification works great...but you definitely see all of those wrinkles!</li>
    <li> bought for my mom and she loves it. she just started a face routine and could not believe the size of her pores. I told her people dont look at you through a 10 x&#x27;s magnifying glass...but its good to see where your face needs work!</li>
    <li> This mirror does very well at filling the need it was purchased for but were we to order again we would purchase 1 with a light.</li>
    <li> Luv this mirror for putting on my makeup and grooming my eyebrows. Only mirror i use now.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, heavy duty.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was dissappointed when I received this after reading such great reviews.  I find it hard to see in, you really need to get your face close to the mirror in order to see, otherwise it&#x27;s distorted. Also, the mirror itself is not 6 inches, it&#x27;s 6 inches end to end so the mirror is really only 5.5 inches, pretty small.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift - my mom was happy.</li>
    <li> The mirror arrived quickly and unbroken.  The 10x magnification is very good, although some new face features appear (more wrinkles visible).  Originally my wife (primary user) thought it was too small (old one was 10\\&quot; but got broken on 1 side).  Now she says it is fine and easy to handle for doing eye makeup.  I ordered it without her knowledge, so I am also happy also.</li>
    <li> a little disappointed--thought the mirror would be larger.  zoom side is great tho</li>
    <li> Mirror exactly as described. Only returned as I realized I wanted one with lights.</li>
    <li> A great purchase for my college dormitory. I see my face in HD, lol! It is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I needed another mirror, preferably a free standing and well-balanced one, and this one met my needs. It&#x27;s 6 inches across the frame, but the actual mirror viewing surface is only 5 ¼ inches with a total height of 11 inches. Due to the narrow base, it&#x27;s not as heavy as some standing mirrors, but with the adequate weight, I can pick it up by the stem and use as a hand mirror without any balance issues. The nickel finish is nice, the design is no frills, but an attractive replacement for my big plastic framed mirror that has seen better days. The magnification side is much stronger than my old mirror, which is a perfect upgrade for my aging eyesight.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m ordering more for my other bathrooms. The price and quality allows for a confident purchase.</li>
    <li> It was as described but unfortunately for someone who is nearsighted it is not the best so passed it on to another person.</li>
    <li> wife like it to put her make up on</li>
    <li> I use this mirror as my daylight makeup sanity check. (you know, when you put your makeup on in the bathroom under inside lighting, sometimes you step outside into bright natural light and end up unintentionally looking like a painted whore). So far, so good. I look awesome every day thanks to this handy mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror was just as described and is actually sturdier than I anticipated.  It was an excellent for a mirror that cost twice as much of a different brand.  Hopefully this one will work better, and I absolutely love the 10x side of the mirror, nothing like being able to view my wrinkles like they were deep canyons on a map.</li>
    <li> This is a very solid extra heavy mirror and is just as lisited it has 10 × magnification it realy brings everything into veiw good product</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t regret this purchase. Excellent design, balance, and finish. Its durable and will last years if not a lifetime with proper care.</li>
    <li> Huge fan of Amazon, but they really screwed up this one. I expect more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a completely damaged box (one side was caved in). There was a sticker on it that said \\&quot;Warehouse Deals.\\&quot; I opened it up to find the mirror part intact (surprisingly), but the one of the two screws on the side had fallen off the glue and the mirror was not affixed to the stand in any way. The actual shipping (plain cardboard) box was completely fine, mind you, as well as the other items inside the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is also MUCH shorter than the posting leads you to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could return this, but it&#x27;s probably more hassle (and lost money) than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> This mirror will absolutely exceed your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 11 inches tall, 6 inches across, and has a sturdy base that is approximately 3.5 inches in diameter. Mirror itself is clear-- no distortions, no problems with clarity.It is substantial and very well made-- looks and feels FAR more expensive than the 14$ price tag!</li>
    <li> I received this mirror promptly and I really like the size and look. I bought it for my dorm and it&#x27;s super convenient to have around. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product and would recommend it for anyone who&#x27;s interested in keeping around a useful and good quality table top mirror.</li>
    <li> No more mustache. Ha. Even over 60, I now can see up close again. I can go out in public without the fear of stray hairs on my upper lip or chin.</li>
    <li> Beautiful finish and excellent magnification without distortion.  I purchased this for a guest bathroom and have had excellent compliments from my guests.  I tried it out a few days myself before putting in a guest bath and I was pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Love the 10x, perfect to use, wished the stand was shorter, but still a great buy!</li>
    <li> Nice mirror to supplement the sink mirror.  Does fog up but can&#x27;t have everything.  Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> broke after a few months but still use the handheld part</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, looks great in my bathroom. pretty pedestal, magnification is slightly large for me</li>
    <li> The 10X magnigication and clarity is quite inferior to similar other 10X magnification mirrors. Compared with other mirror/s, holding mirrors at same length will show you different results/magnification.</li>
    <li> Very Heavy. Good Quality</li>
    <li> I really needed this mirror as I am wheelchair bound and can&#x27;t stand to see myself in the bathroom mirror to get ready in the morning.  I really like this mirror.</li>
    <li> This is the smartest purchase I have made in years.  Frees up my hands to apply make-up with accuracy so I don&#x27;t look like a raggedy anne doll.  Shipped fast with great packing.  Mirror arrived perfectly.</li>
    <li> Perfect vanity mirror and looks nice too.  I love being able to switch the magnetization. It makes it easy to get my eyebrows plucked perfectly.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very pretty, looks well made. I bought it to put on my desk at work and it looks terrific. The silver base / handle / etc. is not that super silvery color that looks cheap. Rather this mirror has a nice look to it. The 10x magnification on the opposite side is a little much for me, so I just use the regular side of the mirror. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  It looks good on the vanity and has the magnification power I wanted.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> 10 x magnification and big enough to see my whole face.</li>
    <li> It is not what I expected.  I was scared to buy a stronger one with higher magnifying, from other reviews.  I wish now I had bought a 12x.  It&#x27;s ok to use for makeup.</li>
    <li> cool mirror....well made</li>
    <li> The stand was loose upon arrival.</li>
    <li> I wanted a mirror to use for plucking a few facial hairs and getting around corners that my small mirror won&#x27;t work good in the house on.  This is perfect.  It magnifies so large my facial hair looks huge and trying to use it around the corners to look at something, wow, super huge sight  now.  First one I bought thru warehouse deals came cracked; had to buy one at full price and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> Mirror, mirror, on a stand. Who&#x27;s the fairest in the land?&lt;br /&gt;(I couldn&#x27;t resist!)  After breaking three lighted makeup mirrors by knocking them off of my small vanity I decided to go low tech.  This mirror is the perfect size!  The magnification is excellent!  It fits nicely on the vanity and the brushed metal is really attractive. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> The mirror is much smaller than i expected.  It looks nice and work to travel with but if you are looking for something to keep for a long term basis i would recommend a larger mirror.</li>
    <li> I broke my wife&#x27;s makeup mirror whiel doing a voluntary household repair.  Remember that no good deed goes unpunished.  Needed replacement and this is fine.  Strong product at the right price point.  Buy w/confidence.</li>
    <li> For the price... cant beat it. It is a lil thing but it does the job.... magnifying ur face... it was scary seeing my face that close lol</li>
    <li> looks great on the counter. just as described.  Could be helpful to be a little taller, but it works for what I need.</li>
    <li> Great mirror - great price - i would not take this for traveling because it is not really portable but perfect for home use</li>
    <li> I paid 14.99 for this mirror.  About 9.99 would be my sweet spot.  It is a little small, but well-made enough; feels pretty sturdy.  It is the perfect size for a face.  It can be used for doing makeup if you lean over the table to use it (not very tall stand).  On the plus side, it is extremely portable.  One side is normal magnification; the other side is 10x, good for eyebrows and eye make up.  Overall, a nice purchase and certainly useful.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror to get rid of a blemish near my eye and the magnification on it was PERFECT! I also like the finish and the size of the mirror.</li>
    <li> I really liked this mirror. It was the perfect size for my desk, it has great magnification on one side. The only thing that I wish it had was a light, but not everybody needs that. Overall great value</li>
    <li> This mirror is small, but big enough for make-up and other things.  It has a really cute beaded design around the bottom and the edge of the magnified side that matched my other bathroom fixtures perfectly</li>
    <li> Perfect size mirror - and perfect price. Came on time and now I won&#x27;t miss a single hair while plucking my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I love the size of this mirror, and the 10x magnifying effect is just nice. A nice tough will be to add lights around the ream.</li>
    <li> As a new student from a different country who is obsessed with makeup and just set up shop in the school&#x27;s dormitory it was a struggle to do my morning preparations using the meagre mirror they provided or my own compacts. I needed something light-ish and easy to move around, not too big to handle, with normal AND magnified mirrors...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this was precisely what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is sleek, beautiful with a clean finish. Something straight out of a Hollywood 1980s movie if you ask me. The magnification is perfect for those minute eyebrow hairs and perfect mascara applications whilst the normal is just the right diameter to see the whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing buy, and I will not hesitate to recommend it to anyone, nor replace it if required. Good price too!</li>
    <li> This is a very good mirror.  If you don&#x27;t mind seeing the \\&quot;real you\\&quot;, you will like it.  It is not overly big and has a good, sturdy base so it won&#x27;t tip over easily.  I don&#x27;t see well without my glasses so this is just what I needed for applying make-up.  The magnification is very good and the nickel finish is very nice.  Get one; you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Whos the smartest shopper of them all? I am.. this mirror is awesome for applying makeup and u can really see up close to remove ur eyebrows completely without missing any.</li>
    <li> I wanted a table top mirror to apply my make up.  This is a perfect size and is very attractive and sturdy as well.  It&#x27;s just what I was looking for at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great Mirror, very good value for the money. Note: this mirror is very small, I throw it in my suitcase on trips. Check size on website.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror - pictures do not do it justice</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this small makeup mirror because it does the job and well.  It looks pretty and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space in my bathroom.  I really wanted one with a light, but didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money.  I am not disappointed that I opted for no light, the mirror is great.</li>
    <li> This mirror does its job fine but there are some cons to it along with the pros. It is way too short for my vanity table, the 10x magnification is hard to use because you have to get up really close to it, also it moves around too easily. The mirror itself is also kind of small. Other than all of that I would say its an ok mirror.</li>
    <li> If you are presently using this type of mirror, be sure you measure your old one.  This one was much smaller than my old one and the mirror does not come off for travel.  I am keeping it because it looks nice in my remodeled bathroom.  Well made, just kind of small.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected ,&lt;br /&gt;Great size and well made . I&#x27;m very satisfied&lt;br /&gt;In my purchase . 10x magnification  is great for tweezing .</li>
    <li> Its smaller than expected, its not the same size as the ones at Target or Walmart. It&#x27;s still a great mirror. I use it for my makeup up and to pluck my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> It was a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> Finally got a tabletop mirror instead of bending my body over the sink to see myself in the mirror. Mirror is very clear. Reflection is not distorted or anything. The magnified side makes tweezing so much easier.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror, sturdy.  Big enough but doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of counter space.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for eyes that are not quite as sharp as they used to be.  The magnification side works great to help out.&lt;br /&gt;Nice finish and design.</li>
    <li> The mirro is nice , I have one for my daughter, she loves it. The price and quality ratio is nice</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Glad I purchased this mirror.  The 10X magnification is extreme!  I ordered this mirror first and because the quality was so good, I ordered the 5X magnification.</li>
    <li> Its a good little vanity mirror, very simple but works fine. Its also pretty sturdy because I dropped it on hard floor the other day and thought for sure it broke..but it was perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror it is sturdy and not cheap looking its quality is awesome , I only wish it was a little bit bigger and it did have a few scratches on the sides of it but ver all pretty good, recommend :)</li>
    <li> This is a great little makeup mirror (especially for my older eyes) at a very good price!  Quick shipping, too.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  Both my wife and I like this mirror.  I thought it might to be too small but it is large enough and it looks nice in our remodeled bathroom.</li>
    <li> I got one of these for my daughter when she first started wearing makeup. One side is normal and one side is magnified. I found myself using it more than she did, however, so I got one for myself. It&#x27;s great for anyone whose vision is starting to go with age!</li>
    <li> 10x gives you a really good close up view of all your imperfections&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little getting used to, but seems to be pretty well made (no distortion)&lt;br /&gt;and a much better price than Bed Bath and Beyond</li>
    <li> This mirror is very well made and heavy duty. Also the 10X magnification is perfect for someone with astigmatism like me whilst applying makeup, etc.</li>
    <li> i got this when my husband finally put my vanity table up and i couldn&#x27;t put a mirror up i love it and am very happy with it would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> As an old fogey with deteriorating eyesight, I need every bit of magnification I can get to see the anomalies of my appearance that require much needed attention!  This mirror gives me the magnified insight I need!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice looking mirror that I can leave on my bathroom counter. I like the fact that it has a magnified side to it.</li>
    <li> Just the right size and looks very nice on my bathroom vanity.  The magnification side is really good for me. Since my up close vision can be a problem I appreciate the clear image.  All in all a very good buy, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my wife. However, it is too small to be sitting on a bathroom counter for makeup application. So she found a wall mount mirror similar to this for that purpose. The Jerdon mirror is heavy and well made, but did not meet her needs.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror for my wife. She loves it. Very sturdy and solidly made and arrived damage-free. She uses it daily.</li>
    <li> good mirror- maybe should have gotten one with a light. Still does the trick. Two sided: one regular mirror and one magnified</li>
    <li> Although this mirror is smaller than I expected, it does the trick.  My eyesight isn&#x27;t what it used to be and I can see every little detail on my face for applying makeup or grooming.  It magnifies very strongly so unless you need that I&#x27;d suggest you get one that is 8X instead of 10X.  However for me it&#x27;s perfect and made very nicely.  Definitely made for someone who needs a lot of magnification.</li>
    <li> This mirror is downright gorgeous. When I got it in the mail yesterday I was really worried by the box size that the mirror would be smaller than it appeared but NOPE! Just as the description tells you. It&#x27;s beautiful, the mirror is clear and crisp and I am super happy that I now have a nice mirror for my vanity.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Seems to be a silver colored plastic. Mine is crooked. Completely leaning sideways from the base. The mirrors seem to work fine. I will be returning this item.</li>
    <li> Very handy mirror to have with its magnified side</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mirror to assist me with putting in and taking out my contact lenses as I am new to contacts and needed to SEE what I was doing.  I purchased this mirror, received it 2 days ago and it is PERFECT.  That means it works, is compact and is priced right...bought another today for my office.  When I opened the package and put the mirror on the kitchen table my 17 year old daughter commented: WOW I can use this to pluck my eyebrows; when did I get that zit; I can see everything!  That pretty much says it all. You will be happy with this mirror!</li>
    <li> The magnifying part was so intense, I think I saw into my soul.  I didn&#x27;t like what was in there.</li>
    <li> I flip this mirror upside down and lay it on the top of my couch (the back support part, not the seat) to do my makeup. It is more comfortable than sitting in a chair for a long time. Then angle the mirror downward so I can see better. Then I use the flashlight app on my cell phone and prop that on top to give some light. That light is great for extracting blackheads and plucking hairs. I never use the magnifying side, just the normal one, since I&#x27;m near sighted and before I put my contacts in I can see really super close up without the magnifying glass.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I am thinking of buying one for my mother. It is small but zooms into all your facial needs.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror. It&#x27;s the perfect size to travel with, and I keep it in my bathroom all the time</li>
    <li> My daughter brought this Jerdon mirror home with her from college and I am fairly impressed with her choice. This is a well made and good looking mirror that matches our main bathroom fixtures quite well. The mirror parts work a expected, with the 10x side being surprising clear and leaving nothing to imagination as every pore is significantly magnified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> Very good mirror, I love the two sides with different magnitutes. Only compliant wish it had a light.</li>
    <li> So, I bought this item for myself, but the family has taken it over (especially hubby) Needless to say it has its pros and cons. The pros is that you can see everything so close and the cons is you can see everything &amp;#34;soooooo&amp;#34; close.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It is rust resistant and just the right magnification for my use!</li>
    <li> If you like to have fancy perfect eyebrows and you pluck them then no need to say more lol this is greaaaaaaattttt! I can see much better now what I&#x27;m doing :P</li>
    <li> very nice wife likes it.</li>
    <li> This mirror was just what I needed. It magnifies 10x and you are able to see everything..unfortunately...wrinkles..etc. It is very sturdy and use it about everyday. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for the money! Easy to carry around, I am going to buy many of these  for my other bathrooms.</li>
    <li> This is just the right size.  It has super magnification and looks fantastic.  I spect $14.99 on this mirror.  I think this is an extraordinary deal!  Similar mirrors in stores cost double and they have a brass finish.  So far, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> The description of the product is exactly what I received.  The base is very stable and the swivel mirror holds the position you move it to.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Best mirror I&#x27;ve ever had. I can see to pluck hairs without my glasses; and that is really saying something!!</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t impress me, nothing special about this mirror, got rust in 6 months after staying in a bathroom. i hardly use it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 13 yr old daughter and she loves it, she really likes the 10x she says it makes it really easy to put her makeup on in the morning.  Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product! it has a very good zoom! I&#x60;m very happy with this product! The sell has a very good comunication!</li>
    <li> This item is nice size to sit on my sink. I like the magnification side too. A great product. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> need to see up close and this does the trick. I use it all the time, love the shape. not to big and not to small.</li>
    <li> My daughter was thrilled to get this for Christmas.  She has a vanity mirror, but needed something to see up close when she&#x27;s doing her eyebrows and eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror! The base is heavy enough to keep it in place, the swivel feature is great, and the magnified side is perfect for eye makeup. I love it!</li>
    <li> Magnification was not strong enough and mirror somewhat distorted.  Returned for a 15x mirror.</li>
    <li> perfect mirror, just right for everything, makeup, hair, etc. Love It.</li>
    <li> Nice and works great.</li>
    <li> A little bit pricey since it is not electrified, but a solidly constructed, well designed two-faced mirror.  The quality of both the structure and the mirrors is far better than most, so the price is worth it.  It is heavy enough so that tipping is not an issue, and small enough to save space on the vanity.  I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great magnifying mirror!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a morror that I could take when I travel. This does the trick. It is small and does not take up a lot of room</li>
    <li> This mirror not only looks great it&#x27;s just the right size.  Love the magnafier for applying eye make-up. Shipped very quickly &amp; packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> i love it. it is just perfect to me. but the magnifying side is useless to me because it 10x is just TOO MUCH to look at.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror well, because getting older I need a stronger mirror for my eye makeup.  This works perfectly, especially the magnifier side.  Nice heavy weight feel to this and stylish enough to leave on the vanity.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect standing vanity mirror. It&#x27;s weighted bottom doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room. Pretty metal finish. Perfect size mirror for makeup. Not too heavy to pick up if I want to hold it with one hand.  Very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> Love the option of regular mirror and 10X magnified, can now see what my makeup looks like.  It&#x27;s nice looking &amp; doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> This is a very sturdy, well-made mirror and a great price! This could be handed down through generations, that well-made. Does it help my 56-year-old butt in putting on my eye makeup? YOU BET! But dang girls, you want to feel REALLY old? But a magnifying mirror!!!!! LOL!</li>
    <li> Very attractive, useful glass mirror. 10x magnification perfect for tweezing eyebrows, the mirror stays in the position you put it in. If you don&#x27;t want to get that up close and personal, flip it over and the other side is a normal mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size for sitting on bathroom counter. Seems to be very well made- it&#x27;s sturdier and heavier than I expected (in a good way). Definitely looks more expensive than it actually is. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> THE FIRST ONE I RECIVED WAS PACAGED DEFECTIVE .  THIS ONESEEMS TO BE OK . HOPEFULY IT WILL LAST.</li>
    <li> Love it. Nice quality</li>
    <li> Because the mirror swivels, it can be set to any angle so that regardless of your height or the height of the table, you can find an angle that is comfortable for you. I really like that it&#x27;s somewhat heavy so I won&#x27;t accidentally knock it over when I&#x27;m reaching for something next to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dimensions are exactly as described and it looks like a nice, expensive mirror! I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the quality of the mirror.  It&#x27;s a perfect size and love that its a regular mirror and a 10X magnifying mirror in one.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice weight to it.  Should last for years. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Finally a mirror I can use.I have bought several different mirrors over the course of several years to replcace a small 10x mirror. They just could never do the job. I am so happy with this mirror. I would highly recommend this mirror</li>
    <li> Excellent magnification</li>
    <li> I wanted a mirror to use to put in my contac lens and it provides enough magnification that I can easily see where to place the lens.  It makes the job much easier and less stressful.  The magnification is good and it is a nice looking mirror.  I would have liked one like it that lit up but I couldn&#x27;t locate one with a light that was the smaller size that this one is.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> Although these mirrors arrived pre-assembled, they appear to lean. The assembly seems sturdy, but the stem holding the mirror is not situated in the stand so that it&#x27;s perpendicular to the table. The mirror is use-able, but there&#x27;s no apparently easy way to fix the problem (e.g., unscrew from the bottom and re-assemble.) Now I see why these were discount priced.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the mirror. The magnification is great for tweezing. The mirror stays put when it is swiveled into different positions. Cleans nicely.</li>
    <li> Received this today and couldn&#x27;t wait to get it open. Enough magnification to locate all those pesky stray eyebrow hairs, but not too much magnification to see right through to the cell level. It looks clean, isn&#x27;t bulky and sits on the bathroom countertop nicely.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for the vanity we added to our master bathroom during a recent remodel.  It has the right weight, is a good size, and complements the new brushed nickel sink faucets and sconces--and the price was right.  It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Quality of mirror is good.&lt;br /&gt;Reflection after magnification is also clear.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product. This is exactly as they have written in the description.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife for Christmas, as she has poor vision in her 1 eye and needs the extra magnification. She has used it quite a few times to apply make up and says that she loves it</li>
    <li> This is the leader in Vanity mirror for people.  Jerdon has the right amount of magifying for finding small hairs and more on face and putting on makeup etc.  I highly recommend it.  No scratch high quality materials used and everything.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put makeup on and i really like this mirror. I would buy it again or recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror. The quality is great. The purchase is worth it. The silver finish is nice. Good buy.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great, great the weighted bottom is nice. It&#x27;s good quality too, my 1 year old has dropped it a couple times and its still standing. The magnified side is great for tweezing hairs.</li>
    <li> Mirror is perfect on both sides. Easy to use anywhere I need it. Easy to pack. I just love it.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror, sturdy, good size and pretty silver color, I use it during my jewelry parties and vendor events. I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and I like it that it&#x27;s heavy and holds its position. It a little scary to look into though !</li>
    <li> nice brushed metal, good mirror, swivels well. Now I just need better lighting in my bathroom to get the full potential!</li>
    <li> Loving the product although it is bit small than I expected. But, the price is right for the size and working fine.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mirror for the price it is of good quality although I think 10 times magnification is a bit too much, given the chance to do over again I would prefer maybe five times magnification.</li>
    <li> It is a nice mirror with high quality and looks great on my desk.  I would like to recommend it to my friends without hesitation.</li>
    <li> My old mirror was much bigger and took up a lot of space.  This one looks good and is great for makeup application.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this mirror.  I have a hand held one, but this one is dual sided which is much better for doing make up.  It arrived as scheduled and thank you!</li>
    <li> Yep it works.  Looks just like picture and magnifies the heck out of your face. Not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad lol...but it&#x27;s what I ordered.</li>
    <li> This is a very useful little mirror to have in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen other magnification mirrors that are hard to focus. This one is very easy and magnifies the image excellently. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> Lightening speed delivery. Felt was a little loose on the bottom but I fixed it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Its so small and it doesn&#x27;t have a light so its hard to see in for 20$ I was expecting something a lot better then this crap</li>
    <li> Beautiful and sturdy.</li>
    <li> The mirror is high quality, but I would have liked the base to be taller. Still, it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror! Made well!</li>
    <li> I misread the description and thought I was ordering a lighted mirror.  Other than that oversight the mirror will do the job satisfactorily.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! I use it in my dorm and it is the perfect size. I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Finally I am able to tweeze my eyebrows comfortablywithout having to hold a magnifying mirror with one hand. I also just bought a very stylish mahogany vanity which blends well with my bedroom furniture. This was a great purchase for me as it makes my life easier.The mirror is perfect to see small details</li>
    <li> This is a nice mirror with good magnification.  It came fast and was in good condition. The only thing I wish it had would have been a light.  But that would be much costlier.</li>
    <li> Got it today (LOVE LOVE LOVE Prime) and this is a great mirror. I had an 8x magnification and it broke so I thought, why not get a 10x. It was a smart choice. No more fine eyebrow hairs or chin hairs getting away from me!</li>
    <li> A really nice mirror.</li>
    <li> Wonderful mirror!!!  Very convenient for my desk, and it&#x27;s perfect for putting on makeup, or just combing your hair!!  It&#x27;s a GREAT mirror!!!  I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Nice product,  great price,  fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Perfect for putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> the mirror is not totally flat...</li>
    <li> Magnify mirror sucks.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror very much.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my aging eyes.  It&#x27;s lightweight and compact but makes applying makeup in the morning so much easier now with the magnifying feature.</li>
    <li> Sturdy design, and attractive. However the 10x magnification side is too much for me. I always end up using the 1x. I&#x27;d suggest maybe a 3x-6x.</li>
    <li> This is a solid piece &#x3D; no wobble - no sharp ends.  It is something I will be proud to display.</li>
    <li> My mother have one like this. Decided to get one for myself. Now I can pluck my eyebrows without glasses. I should have bought one years ago. Amazon sure makes it easy to do research on products. I spend a lot of money on Amazon buying for family. Purchasing the Prime membership in December was the best choice I have ever made. It have more than paid for itself.</li>
    <li> absolutely no complaints on this mirror.  Good clear magnification, stable stand and a wonderful price.  Highly recommend this especially if you are looking for a stronger magnification like the 10x.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror and well built.  This is a solid mirror and glass is real.  I recommend this purchase if you are looking for a dual purpose device.</li>
    <li> Good mirror for the money and I can see my makeup without having to wear my glasses, fits on small vanity nicely. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this mirror since the price is so reasonable. Just got the mirror today and I am very pleased! It is good quality, a good weight, and doesn&#x27;t look cheap. I bought this mirror to sit at a table next to my window to do my makeup in natural light. This will be just perfect. It&#x27;s the right size and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really heavy, and awkward to use-  I wish I had bought a different mirror with a light.  The magnification is also not as good as I hoped for, although that&#x27;s not the fault of the product.</li>
    <li> Super handy, I take it everywhere. Even when we travel.</li>
    <li> Wanted a mirror to keep on my bathroom countertop. Feels quality, good price for what it is. Really magnifies the face so I don&#x27;t mess up my eyebrows while plucking. Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several over the years and I really like this one because it is easy to handle, not heavy yet very sturdy and I move mine around a lot but this one stays in one piece and not flimsy at all - the magnification is very good no distortion - easy to clean and portable.</li>
    <li> I received 2 of these my mistake.  The order process did not cancel out one so I got a duplicate.  Sent one back,  Still had not received the credit.  Its been 2 weeks so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this mirror is exactly what I was hoping for.  It&#x27;s a good size and the magnification is what I need.  It&#x27;s nice looking, the weight is good and does not fall over, and it&#x27;s a real mirror, not one of those cheepo&#x27;s you find at Walmart or the dollar stores.</li>
    <li> The best combination table and hand held mirror which I&#x27;ve seen to date with the dual magnification which I require.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. Quality seemed good. The size is nice--not too tiny and not too large. I chose this over the lighted ones as many of those reviews raised questions. She is happy with it.</li>
    <li> When I got this, I was really pleased with the quality. I seems like it should cost a lot more. It feels like it will last a long time and it looks really pretty on my shelf.</li>
    <li> This mirror is awesome! I&#x27;ve had it for about two weeks and I love it already! It&#x27;s the perfect size and height. It has a regular size and also a 10x magnified side!</li>
    <li> So the mirror works, no question. But realize that the actual mirror is concave, and therefore has a more specific focal point. In short, you have to get close to the mirror to resolve anything, and by the time you&#x27;re that close, it&#x27;s harder to make out anything on your body the further that &#x27;thing&#x27; is from your eyes. I bought the mirror to try and spot and pull out ingrown hairs, but viewing past my chin is a bit of a chore. For that reason, I&#x27;d recommend getting one of these that you can mount on the wall, and swivel so you can you the reflection of a normal, bigger mirror to see things like ingrowns. Otherwise, a great mirror, definitely gets you close in.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift, but you have to get too close to the mirror to use it. The 6-inch is a little small. Next time I&#x27;ll go for less magnification and an 8-inch mirror.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it was so inexpensive!  I have priced these in stores for much more.  It looks nice, it moves easy.  I only wish it had lights!</li>
    <li> buy a mirror, thinking that it illuminated. But it is my fault in English. Loved it increases! For correction of eyebrows super thing. Makeup is also perfect, we see all the pores of the face and even the hairs on the face) also make up this mirror to be perfect!</li>
    <li> Great help for women who need sturdy stands for plucking hair.  Love the magnification. Love both sides of the mirror.</li>
    <li> Perfect size - no assembly required and with the magnifcation it is perfect.  Would recommend this item to anyone looking for the perfect mirror.</li>
    <li> Though others stated that the mirror was small I took a chance and purchased it. It is the perfect size to travel with. I use this mirror to look at my pores and tweeze stray hairs. I love the fact that it has a sturdy solid feel to it and a beautiful silver polished finish. This mirror would be an extra on the vanity. Not what you would get if your looking for something to complete your makeup routine just to admire up close when finished.</li>
    <li> This is heavy and well put together. It looks great on my dresser and does not seem flimsy at all. Made of metal, not plastic. I expect it to hold up well. If it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;ll update the review</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and i use it. Boom</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great value! Very good price for high quality and nice looking. It doesn&#x27;t wobble and actually heavy (good thing!) Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I brought this mirror for my vanity. I&#x27;ve recently gotten into eye makeup and needed this mirror to help me put my makeup on without my glasses on. I&#x27;m young but I have very blurry vision without my glasses on but I can see myself pretty good in this mirror! It makes putting on makeup a bit easier. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This mirror is great. It lets me see terrible things about myself that would otherwise go unnoticed due to my failing eye sight. It has a solid, relatively heavy base and seems extremely sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also came with an instruction and maintenance booklet explaining the functionality of the mirror. The booklet is extremely useful if you are unclear on the concept of mirrors and their reflective properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a mirror that not only magnifies your reflection, but helps you see tiny things on your face, this one certainly works well. Bear in mind that it does not include a light - if you intend to hold it up very close to your face, you may need an additional light source.</li>
    <li> I got this for some who had broken theirs, When she received it she loved the side the magnifies 10x. She says buy it, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror on my shopping list for over a year.  I considered it a luxury purchase that could wait.  I was very excited to see it now priced under $12.00.  It is beautiful.  It is large enough to see my whole face.  On the magnified side, I can see hairs that I didn&#x27;t even know I had.  It&#x27;s sturdy and weighty and I just love it.  I feel good that I was able to treat myself to something so nice for only $12.00.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror - stable, looks nice, big and so inexpensive! It&#x27;s great when you look for a mirror to properly put on make-up</li>
    <li> The nickel finish on this product is beautiful and is mirror feels sturdy in hand and on table. It does what it is suppose to do and I am satisfied with purchase given high price of similar products in retail shops. The 10x magnification is awesome! Liked the fact it has a warranty attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it is described as 6 inches in diameter, the mirror surface is only 5.25 inches. The magnifying side is also slightly concave hence  the edges of one&#x27;s face would go out of focus when you move ever so slightly. For the face to be in total focus, you would have to be between 4-5 inches away from the mirror and you have to be absolutely still ie not move your head forwards or backwards. This is a little too close for my comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, I should have gone for a bigger mirror like the the first one I had and misplaced while moving. About 8 inches in diameter would be perfect and a lower magnification x8 times would suffice as x10  times magnification is unnecessary for just a normal make-up routine.  A mirror with lower magnification would cost less too.</li>
    <li> This magnification side of this mirror is terrific.  I can actually see my face very close-up and clearly - for example I can now see all the teeny pesky stray eyebrow hairs that I missed by trusting my old &amp;#34;magnification&amp;#34; mirror. It is nice and compact and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space (plus no messy cords to deal with as you would with a light-up magnification mirror).  The brushed metal finish is of good quality.  The mirror has a good weight to it also.  The only drawback is that it is fairly low - about 12 inches high -  you will need to pick it up to look closely at your face.  I would have liked to see this offered in a taller version also which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.  Otherwise I am very happy with this mirror for the price!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide whether I wanted a mirror with lights or not. After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase this one. I need glasses to see things close up but the 10x magnification allows me to put on make-up without using my glasses. My room is lit enough that I don&#x27;t require the mirror to be lighted. It appears to be a sturdy product and the mirror stays at the angle that I tilt it. It&#x27;s a basic mirror but it works very well for my needs.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this mirror, especially the price. It is small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room and is great for putting on makeup</li>
    <li> I looked at similar mirrors at stores in the area and this one is nicer and less expensive than those that I saw. I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Great to see stuff up close.</li>
    <li> Really nice mirror. I thought the size and shape are really good and just what I needed. HOWEVER the only side that has the decorative edge is the side that is magnified. They should have it on both sides (or at least the normal side of the mirror). If I&#x27;m looking close to my face using the 10x side, I&#x27;m not paying attention to the edge of the mirror. But if I&#x27;m looking at my whole face, the edge comes into view and it would have been nice to have it  on that side. The only reason I could think of as to why they did it like that is to have a bigger mirror, but they could have at least put that in the discription!</li>
    <li> Really good quality of material used.  would recommend.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY NICE MIRROR AND NICE QUALITY. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE INTERESTED. IF I HAD IT TO DO OVER AGAIN IT WOULD BE ONE THAT ATTACHED TO THE WALL</li>
    <li> My vision isn&#x27;t quite what it used to be, so this mirror helps.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a mirror that I accidentally knocked over and then I accidentally knocked this one off my counter within two weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It is so useful for applying makeup and lets you see very detailed images especially on the magnified side.</li>
    <li> This is a good little mirror. Get to see everything with this little sucker. Glad that I decided to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this mirror.  I use it daily and it has become a part of my daily beauty regimen.  I do not have to wear my glasses to apply my make-up, and this is great.  It helps me to tend to minute details iin the application of my make-up.</li>
    <li> it was ripped from the bottom of the mirror but other then that i really liked it. i liked the color of the mirror too!</li>
    <li> This mirror looks great and works well.  It arrived fast and safely.  I think for the money it was a bargain.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say? It&#x27;s a mirror. I can see myself in it! LOL It is attractive. On a funnier note, I thought it was hilarious it came with &#x27;.How To Use&#x27;  instructions and a diagram identifying which part is the mirror and which is the stand. In three languages. LOL</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It looks classy in my bathroom and the magnification on this mirror shows me everything that I need to see. I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> this is what i order the right size easy to clean not to big just right  worth the money.thank you.</li>
    <li> NO MISTAKE AT ALL IF YOU USE THIS MAGNIFYING DOUBLE SIDE MIRROR!!! THE ONLY THING IS VERY SMALL.6INCHS.GOOD QUALITY .</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mirror.  The 10x&#x27;s works perfectly for eyebrow pencil, mascara, etc.  Very lightweight.  I bought it to replace a stupid lighted mirror.  I did not care for that mirror, love this one!</li>
    <li> A piece of junk! The image turns upside down at times! My bathroom mirror does a better job of magnifying!</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect. Shipped really fast!</li>
    <li> great size mirror, works as expected, ordered one for a friend after she used and liked mine!</li>
    <li> very nice.  difficult finding strong 10x</li>
    <li> It fits on the dresser and looks like it belongs with the other items on the dresser. The magnification was exactly what I wanted for finding eye lashes in my eyes as well as stray hairs that needed plucked.</li>
    <li> Looks great on my bathroom vanity, and I love that it is double-sided. Regular and 10x! If you cant see what you need to with the 10x side, you&#x27;re blind! The clarity on both sides is a lot better than my old mirrors. Its awesomely-vivid! Now I can see I look a lot worse than I thought! LOL!</li>
    <li> My fault!  I didn&#x27;t read the description well and ended up with a short vanity mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well... will be more careful in the future!</li>
    <li> this is the perfect size to do my makeup and very nice designed. The 10x side is okay, I barely use it.</li>
    <li> but it is too small.  Definitely couldn&#x27;t use as makeup mirror, is distorted so aeven hard to see to brush teeth.</li>
    <li> Good mirror with good reproduction.</li>
    <li> Have no complaints here, It serves its purpose. It&#x27;s easy to maneuver and works well in my bathroom. And it looks nice.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom because now that she&#x27;s older she has a harder time seeing when she takes off her makeup and stuff. She loves it so it gets five stars</li>
    <li> I use it for putting in my contacts and this is super super handy. I love it because it has a regular side and the 10x magnification</li>
    <li> Looks good, came quickly. Fits into decor. Not to large, so doesn&#x27;t take to much counter room. Needed a mirror for close up, this works. Happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> It is the perfect size and has an attractiive finish.  I like that it has a magnifying mirror on one side</li>
    <li> Wife says it&#x27;s a little on the small side...this replaced the one that broke which was about an inch bigger in diameter but it does the job for her...built very well.</li>
    <li> Good quality... Good price.</li>
    <li> We love it. We found it in a Best Western Hotel. Took the name off the bottom and look it up on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. It is sturdy and the perfect size for applying makeup, plucking eyebrows, etc.</li>
    <li> Its difficult to see sometimes at the max zoom side it gets a little blurry until you get the perfect angle but its works fine specially for the price.</li>
    <li> Great price and fills an empty space in my master bath. Handy to have around.</li>
    <li> This is a good mirror, 6\\&quot; in diameter, on a solid base, with excellent magnification, but would be better if it was larger (maybe 8\\&quot; diameter).</li>
    <li> Good price for a good mirror and a very good quality I saw many in stores worse and more expensive</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this kind of mirror for years, at this price!! I love it! My mom saw it, and she liked it also so much, I ordered another one!</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive counter top mirror. It works and it wasn&#x27;t too pricey. I bought it to use when I access my Power Port (a medical port in my chest) since I do it myself and needed a mirror I could move closer. The problem with this mirror is that unless it is held at just the right angle, the image is distorted and useless. If you hold it straight on, then it is fine. But I needed it to work no matter what. So now I just use it for other things (like plucking my eyebrows and obsessing over my complexion). It works fine for that stuff.</li>
    <li> I was hesitating between a lighted mirror or not, and decided that the lighted mirrors were overpriced, not bright enough, and looked ugly on a table. So I decided on a free standing mirror plus a brood light with a day spectrum halogen flood light, which is VERY bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this mirror because it was cheap and looked elegant. I was not disappointed. I had previously been using a small Conair plastic mirror and hadn&#x27;t realized how much more difficult it was to apply makeup with. This is at a great height and looks elegant on my table. It looks like it should be there rather than like I accidentally forgot to put it away.</li>
    <li> This table mirror is great for working up close (if your table is high enough).  The mirror swivels nicely.  I think this may last a good long time with some level of care and good luck.  (With glass, you can never be entirely certain).  Also, when I compared the cost with something similar in the store, this one was less expensive.  Now I can retire the little 3\\&quot; mirror I&#x27;ve been struggling with until now.</li>
    <li> I was really afraid I was going to end up with one of those cheap mirrors with the fake chrome that chip off.  That is most certainly NOT the case with this mirror.  This mirror had decent weight and a really beautiful (and not fake) finish.  It&#x27;s solid metal. The bottom has a felt cover that ensures you won&#x27;t scratch your surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday.  I carry it from the bathroom to the living room (dear husband, buy me a vanity, please!) and then my two toddlers grab ahold of it and have their way with it too.  I like nice things.  If I had ANY inclination they even COULD break this, I wouldn&#x27;t allow them to touch it.  I&#x27;m quite certain it can withstand toddlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is about 11 inches high and the face of the mirror is actually 5 1/2 inches.  I&#x27;ve had it for just under a year now and it&#x27;s still completely gorgeous.  I will say though that in real life I don&#x27;t notice as much of a tan hue to the nickel as I see in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I went with this and not something more expensive.  When I started looking, this would have been exactly what I wanted anyways!</li>
    <li> Bought two of these for vanities in two bathrooms. They&#x27;re perfect. Well-built and good-looking. Heavy. Look good on the sink counter.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive this mirror is! Yes, it is small, but it is beautifully constructed. It has very nice detailing and both sides of the mirror are very clear. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very good mirror, good for putting on make-up,</li>
    <li> I had to return this mirror.  The 10X magnification was too much, and coupled with the small 6 inch diameter of the mirror, it was difficult to see things clearly.......you had to get too close to the mirror (about 3 inches) to focus and then your eyes were off line.  I&#x27;m going to try the 5X mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very pretty and looks like it costs more than it does!</li>
    <li> Love it. It also is an added decoration for the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Too much magnification for me but was my fault I knew it was 10X</li>
    <li> The quality of the mirror is pretty good, but the 10x magnification is to much, as is almost useless.  I should have purchased a 6x magnification.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with mirror but the stand was too short.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble seeing to shape my eyebrows without my glasses...no more!! The 10x magnification side is as clear and undistorted as the regular side.  I can see to keep my brows in top shape.  The 10x side is also wonderful for applying eyelash enhancers in strip or individual sections.  It helps me to have them even and natural looking, just flip to the regular side to see how you will look to others.  The size is perfect for leaving on the vanity or even slipping into a drawer if you have a clumsy cat as I do. The base is weighted nicely and the finish stays pretty.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs, as it has the option to unscrew the top for travel. It&#x27;s an elegant design and well made.</li>
    <li> Waste of money honestly. the side of my mirror snapped after 2 days and now i need to snap it back everytime i want to use it or super glue it and not be able to move it at all.</li>
    <li> Bought this product a few months ago. Satisfied with this product except for the 10x magnification. It would have been better even it was a 5x. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this mirror.  I wanted this size, I didn&#x27;t want lighted, and I am not traveling with it,  (it is on the heavy side)  The 10x is perfect.  Maybe too good, some things are probably left unseen.  ;)</li>
    <li> This two sided mirror makes it easier to shave and the magnification is awesome.  An excellent product.</li>
    <li> Well made and love the 10X magnification</li>
    <li> I love this mirror, it&#x27;s the correct size and very sturdy with a nice heavy base...HOWEVER - the magnification side is just AWFUL - it is so blurred and out of focus it&#x27;s pretty bad.....I won&#x27;t be able to use the magnify side at ALL-and that was the reason for a 2 sided mirror.Maybe I should have read more reviews???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t know who would really be able to use that side.  If it was a one sided mirror-I would REALLY love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after discovering how bad my vision has gotten.  We were staying with a relative on a recent trip who had a small magnifying mirror adhered to his medicine cabinet mirror.  Naturally, I looked into it and discovered a lot of missed eyebrow hairs that I hadn&#x27;t seen at all without magnification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we returned home, I decided to purchase a magnifying mirror and wanted something that could serve dual purpose and sit on the vanity in our main bathroom.  The nickel finish on this mirror matches the finishes in the bathroom and the flip feature allows for use as a regular mirror or magnified mirror.  It&#x27;s light enough to lift and hold to check the back of your hair.  You can tilt the mirror to whatever angle works best for applying makeup.  The bottom is weighted and covered to sit securely and not damage your counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, the price was terrific and the mirror looks more expensive than it is.  I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this mirror I read the reviews and many people said it was to small.  I think it is the perfect size for those who are tweezer happy like myself. It&#x27;s kinda scary seeing your face this up close!  Beware! LOL!</li>
    <li> a durable and classy looking product standing on my bathroom counter. use it daily to apply make up. easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror. Its the perfect size for my vanity and is high quality for the price. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I really do love this mirror.  I use it everyday to put on my makeup.  The size is perfect as it the magnification.  I don&#x27;t know what I did before.</li>
    <li> Perfect for makeup and doing my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and have bad eyesight this mirror is great.  I have a hard time seeing well enough to pluck my eyebrows and this mirror made it so much easier for me.  My daughter used it and decided she wanted one so I gave her mine and ordered another.</li>
    <li> The product is good and what we had expected. The magnification is like...WOW!  Good product, good price, good product to buy.</li>
    <li> Product same as described. Excellent product</li>
    <li> I love it and fast chipping...</li>
    <li> Does its job well and feels sturdy to the touch</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this mirror at all.  The closer you get, the more distorted the view.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like waves of magnification, and not the whole mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a really well-built mirror. The magnification is perfect, and the finish is high quality. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> After being disappointed at what some stores had to offer in the way of two-sided swivel mirrors, I discovered Amazon and tried to find one that was affordable and of good quality. This mirror is just what I was looking for. Its 10x magnification mirror is perfect to assist with eyebrow plucking and shaping, and I have also found myself regularly checking my blemishes for any sign of change. This is a solid and sturdy mirror but is also lightweight enough to be able to hold it for lengthy amounts of time (I use it to reflect against another mirror to assist with trimming my hair). I have accidentally dropped this mirror from about a half a metre, directly onto a benchtop, and it has survived without even a scratch. This mirror is great value.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, Thanks</li>
    <li> I can not use both sides as the &#x27;magnification&#x27; side makes me feel dizzy (?) who knows why...but the &#x27;normal&#x27; side works properly and definitely a big help in the morning make-up:-)</li>
    <li> I like to have a really strong magnifying mirror when I apply makeup.  As you get older it is good to be able to see every application flaw.  With this mirror you can do a perfect job every time.  It is also wonderful should you need to do any extra work around the eyes.  Can&#x27;t miss with eyedrops when you can actually see what you are doing.</li>
    <li> This is a great looking mirror and the magnification is sufficient, however, after a few months of ownership it became rusty.  I keep it on a shelf in the bathroom so it&#x27;s probably from the humidity in the room, but I was hoping it would last longer than a few months.</li>
    <li> Worst purchase I ever made, turns out I never wanted to see myself this up close and I have developed an unnatural obsession with my eyebrows.  Seriously though it&#x27;s a good little mirror.  I would have liked it to be a bit taller and you need to be quite close to see the magnifying effect - that might just be my very old wrinkly eyes though :-(</li>
    <li> For those of you over 55, this is your product.  The magnification is fantastic and the light helps you to see the minute details when plucking eyebrows, etc.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  The price was very good.  It could have stronger strength but for the price does the trick.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my wife so that she could put on makeup at her desk.  She uses it everyday with no complaints.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife. She likes this mirror. Nice stand. Looks good and she likes the 10x.</li>
    <li> Really pleased with this purchase. I&#x27;ve had it for a month and use it everyday and so far so good!</li>
    <li> just want i wanted fantastic service, Mirror 10 out of 10</li>
    <li> Love the mirror.  Just don&#x27;t let yourself be bothered by all the things you see when it&#x27;s in 10X mode!</li>
    <li> I love my mirror!!  I use it every morning when it is especially hard to see my face clearly.  Also, since I wear glasses it is like having my glasses on to put my makeup on without having my glasses on. If that makes sense to anyone! I definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a close up of their face anytime of the day.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror. The magnification is just what I was looking for. The finish is very nice and the base is sturdy.</li>
    <li> I received this and it was defective.  The piece holding up the mirror was wobbly.  There was no place to tighten it so I am returning it.  The item itself was nice and functional but after doing more shopping, I found similar items that cost less.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very durable, however the side that magnifies is hard to use at times.</li>
    <li> I have impaired vision, and the magnification is sufficient for the purposes of using tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;The base is wide enough to make it stable on my bathroom vanity.</li>
    <li> The 1x side of the mirror is good, no defects or problems there. The 10x magnification side is something I don&#x27;t like. It is slightly caved in so you have to basically hold the mirror 1inch from your face to see anything, otherwise it is very distorted and blurry. Also I don&#x27;t like that the neck of the mirror does not go up at all.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror.  I gave it to my daughter for Xmas and she was thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> yep...looks like me but bigger</li>
    <li> This is THE answer to perfect eye makeup.  No more messy mascara or eyeliner gone wrong.  Affordable and looks great, too.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than most vanity mirrors but works for what I need it for, sturdy and good quality.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001DKQ3O8 Jerdon JP910NB 6-Inch Table Top Mirror, 10X Magnification, Nickel Finish]]&lt;br /&gt;This item is exactly as stated. Nice clean look.&lt;br /&gt;Not cheap looking either. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror when I knocked my old makeup mirror in the sink and cracked it.  This new mirror arrived in a timely manner and is very easy to pick up, set down, and adjust in general -- certainly more so than the one I was using.  Moreover, it looks quite stylish on my counter.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It looks big in the picture. That was the reason, I ordered, but realized after receiving package.&lt;br /&gt;It did not like what I exprected, actually it is small. Whoever buying it, first check the size.</li>
    <li> The mirror has distortion &amp; is much smaller then I expected it to be. The description says that you can use the wall adapter as an option instead of batteries but that&#x27;s not the case. I have returned it &amp; purchased a different Jerdon mirror that I love.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a jewelry display mirror.  Nice and solid, heavy, but not so heavy it&#x27;s hard to lift.  Tension is great for tilting mirror.  Stays put.  Finish is very nice.</li>
    <li> This mirror is solid and made with quality. I have it on top of my dresser and it has the regular view and the magnified view that I apparently need with my newly aging eyes. I can see my pores again!</li>
    <li> Great quality beautiful mirror. I didn&#x27;t give a five star because the little decorations around the normal morrow are absent</li>
    <li> Perfectly fit the decor in my bathroom.  My wife loves it.  Very strong magnification also.  The base is quite heavy for its size.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Sits on vanity or bathroom counter. Magnification is great. Need plenty of light to see. My daughter loved it and kept borrowing it so I had to buy a second one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mirror...not a whole lot else to say.  Durable, attractive and reflective, it does the job! :) No complaints.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a mirror like this and searched stores but the ones I liked were almost $30 and I thought that was too much. This mirror is really well priced and a good quality. I wish I had gotten one with 12x or 15x magnification but that&#x27;s probably my finickiness and has nothing to do with this product. Overall I would recommend this. It is sturdy and I like how it is two sided. I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a little more magnified than what it is, not exactly what I was looking for as far as magniflying.&lt;br /&gt;Good strong base, just not what I had percieved. Good solid made mirrior.</li>
    <li> Nice quality product - I bought two for the new makeup wearers in my house and they were a big hit.  The mirror and stand seem very sturdy and look nice on their dressers.  The magnification side is perfect for my daughter that wears glasses.</li>
    <li> This is just excellent for my needs. We use it to reflect the woodstove from the dining room to see how the fire is doing from the livingroom. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> The mirror has a sturdy base and the mirror has sharp vision for putting on makeup. Love the 10x magnification. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> great travel size,not to big for every day use but great to pack in luggage,see very well,for those needing lil help without the glasses!</li>
    <li> My eyes are not as good as they used to be.  I was wondering which of the 5x, 10x or 15x I would need.  I went to a local store and found all sizes and realized that 10x is the perfect magnification. I found this and the price is right and it matched my bathroom since it is on my counter that was a must.</li>
    <li> It is a good quality mirror and meets my needs.  It is also very well built--dropped it a few times and it has stayed together.</li>
    <li> Ugh, this mirror sucks - don&#x27;t buy it. I bought it for the magnifying side which doesn&#x27;t work - it&#x27;s very blurry and you have to be very close to see clearly - and even then only the immediate center is of any use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product primarily because of the reviews. It is a decent quality mirror with nice magnification at a fair price. It is weighted nicely as well and has a good finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my eyes getting worse over the years, I appreciate being able to see well enough to give my face some needed attention.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase.  Mirror exactly as described.  Mirror is a good buy compared to similar mirrors of other manufacturers.</li>
    <li> its a really nice quality mirror, i am satisfy with my order. I love that its two side and the other side is a 10x Magnification which you can see ur skin so clearly</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror last year and I really do love it. I use it every day to apply make-up. The magnification is not distorted. The mirror is portable and quite sturdy - in fact, I dropped it twice onto tile and it never broke!  I bought another for my daughter and she loves hers, too. The mirror stand is classy looking on a bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> I thought the six inch diameter would be enough, but it&#x27;s really quite small.  The magnification has made it so much easier to pluck my eyebrows and apply eye makeup; it would have been nice to have a larger viewing space.</li>
