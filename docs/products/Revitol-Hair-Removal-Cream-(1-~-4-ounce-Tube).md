### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product worked, for me, wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Wanted to give it my best shot</li>
      <li>You may need to use two applications for best results.</li>
      <li>Would love to find something that would remove hair and keep the hair off for weeks!!!!</li>
      <li>I love this cream!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Tried it then, and wasn&#x27;t overly happy with the results.</li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>but this one seems to be as good as any.</li>
      <li>This product had received really good reviews, but for me, I am not finding that it works any better that NAIR at 1/5th the cost!</li>
      <li>Rinse with warm water, do not use soap.    </li>
      <li>and it was effective at removing the hair.  </li>
      <li>and i used it again during that time, it does get rid of hair nicely and NO hair bumps at all</li>
      <li>it is very strong and as soon as it starts burning u have to wash it off even if hair wasnt removed because it will leave scar and literally burn your skin off</li>
      <li>When I read the fine print, I found that there was a 10 dollar charge for each bottle!  </li>
      <li>It worked but the results I&#x27;d give a C+ at most.</li>
      <li>At $20 a tube, I would expect better results.</li>
      <li>I believe that this company is deceptively advertising a product that does not work any better than store products...</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Was hoping for so much more from this product.  </li>
      <li>Even tried giving more time than it says is required.</li>
      <li>that much better tan</li>
      <li>Unless I eventually have better luck, I will never buy again.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t impressed after the first use, but after second go very pleased.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and easy on the skin.</li>
      <li>The cons are it does have a strong odor</li>
      <li>I strongly urge you to re-consider buying this product.</li>
      <li>but it works exactly as advertised..... painless and effective.</li>
      <li>But when used on my arms &amp; legs, it&#x27;s always fine.</li>
      <li>The reviews couldn&#x27;t have been accurate.</li>
      <li>you think the ingredients on this listing sound</li>
      <li>I tried it today after getting it so far so good.  </li>
      <li>I asked for a full refund five days ago</li>
      <li>Tried five times using nearly a full tube each time.</li>
      <li>I use much cheaper hair removal creams with better results.</li>
      <li>The hope was that it would be effective and not burn her sensitive skin in that area</li>
      <li>Be sure to leave it on for the whole 15 minutes or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Do NOT order Revitol, check your local stores for a much cheaper and more effective product.</li>
      <li>ok in first place is pricey and i left it for 20 minutes just to make sure that it disolves everyting and at the end when i wipped out almost all the hair is still intact.</li>
      <li>I not unhappy</li>
      <li>I figured this would be a nice alternative to the pharmacy products such as Nair, etc...  </li>
      <li>I have tried different suggestions I have read like apply warm water to the skin first, etc.  </li>
      <li>It had a smell like nair, but it was pain free, removed all the hair, and left my skin smooth without the hair stubs.  </li>
      <li>Exfoliate the area and rinse with warm water, dry off  3)</li>
      <li>I first used it like directed on the bottle</li>
      <li>Revitol is good,the first time i used it</li>
      <li>Removed most of hair, no irritation although some was still left.</li>
      <li>This was exactly as described on the tube.</li>
      <li>I purchased the multiple tube deal since the reviews were so convincing on their web sites.</li>
      <li>The pros are that it was definitely pain-free for me, it did remove hair and it was easy clean-up.</li>
      <li>but i use it anyway because no hair bumps,its really gud else where too,</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t even burn the whole time I had it on, just gave me a sensation like mint would.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because it was billed as gentle to the skin.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t imagine that they bill this product as gentle.</li>
      <li>Heard much of the \\&quot;propaganda\\&quot; about this</li>
      <li>you really have to do a patch test ..</li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>one tube is enough for legs two times, full brazillian, and some minor touch on facials :)</li>
      <li>but I didnt mind them so much and still bought it</li>
      <li>Could be gentler, but didn&#x27;t really try it to compare.</li>
      <li>This item doesn&#x27;t smell good, but that&#x27;s the least of my worries.</li>
      <li>Apply a good layer of cream (~3mm thick), DAB IT ON,</li>
      <li>I do recommend that you try it for yourself, products have various results since every person is unique.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product with the hope that it would work better than other hair removal creams I have used.  </li>
      <li>When I got my two bottles, I was excited but that was short lived.</li>
      <li>It did remove hair, but the cost was much too high.</li>
      <li>This will be a short and sweet review.  </li>
      <li>so I figured that I would leave it on the full leg for the entire 7 minutes indicated as a max.</li>
      <li>(products like Nair appear to really burn those sensitive regions).  </li>
      <li>but my chin is sligthly different hair was removed well the first time</li>
      <li>Wiped product off as described, what was left was exactly what I started with.  </li>
      <li>I think I got some old hair removal cream or something because mine will not even come out the container!</li>
      <li>In contrast, the Sally Hanson product that I purchase in the local drug store works like a charm - and is much cheaper!</li>
      <li>Hair seems slightly thinner than original.</li>
      <li>I had no trouble with this at all.</li>
      <li>I tried a test area as the directions called for and I seem to be sensitive to the product.  </li>
      <li>I read most of the negative reviews</li>
      <li>I was surprised when I read that the cream needed to be on for 20 minutes.  </li>
      <li>I contacted \\&quot;The Natural Health</li>
      <li>Never tried Nair and never will considering how sensitive my skin is.</li>
      <li>I truly believe this product is a complete scam.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this for all sensitive areas.</li>
      <li>It removed the hair in a sensitive area in about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>I thought I would try this because the Nair and Veet burn even when I use the sensitive skin formulas.  </li>
      <li>I am definately going to buy another bottle and continue use until hair hopefully stops completely.   </li>
      <li>I truely wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my money.  </li>
      <li>but even then it would not be worth it because half the tub would be gone in one use just for your legs and its costly.</li>
      <li>This item works better than any other hair removal cream I have tried I would recommend , I have some coarse dark hair and it does remove it.</li>
      <li>As the other review rightly says, it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair even when it is left on the skin for 20 mins.</li>
      <li>It barely took out any hair</li>
      <li>So now not only won&#x27;t I ever purchase another \\&quot;Revitol\\&quot; product, but \\&quot;The Natural Health</li>
      <li>but it doesnt remove the hair properly after my second use hair grows back fast</li>
      <li>The hairs appeared weak and limp and they were, so they broke where the hair sticks out of the skin, leaving a good amount of stubble.</li>
      <li>I tried this product with so much hope for my stubborn chin hairs that create ingrowns and dark spots.  </li>
      <li>I continued to use it anyway and used the whole two tubes with no success.</li>
      <li>I then read the ingredients and found that this overpriced revitol contained the same active ingredients as \\&quot;much cheaper\\&quot; hair removal products.  </li>
      <li>, there are limited hair growth on my upper lips and only used it 3 times so far, hair is barely there</li>
      <li>I got the same results the second time, not a single hair was removed.</li>

<li> The but is, that \\&quot;some hair\\&quot; will not grow back each time you use it, but it takes a long long time to stop every hair from growing back.</li>
<li> Now, if you leave it on your private area too long, it will burn.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this product to remove unwanted hair the only problem is I didn&#x27;t follow the precautions and as a result caused me some burning otherwise the product did what it was meant to do.</li>
    <li> I did a test patch as per instructions and nothing happened. I tried again and still no hair was removed. I have no idea why it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I tried this product three times on my legs - which have coarse hair. With this product I could never see a noticeable difference, and they still needed shaving. At $20 a tube, I would expect better results. In contrast, the Sally Hanson product that I purchase in the local drug store works like a charm - and is much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Never tried Nair and never will considering how sensitive my skin is. So opted for the Revitol Hair Remov. Cream instead. The cons are it does have a strong odor and it doesn&#x27;t remove hair like it says it does at the root, plus it&#x27;s pricey. Bottle does state that the claims they make have not been approved by the FDA, which they conveniently hide. The pros are that it was definitely pain-free for me, it did remove hair and it was easy clean-up. How I used it, followed someone else&#x27;s review which is not available anymore:    1) Trim the area so that the hairs are 3-5mm long, or shave and wait for regrowth  2) Exfoliate the area and rinse with warm water, dry off  3) Apply a good layer of cream (~3mm thick), DAB IT ON, DO NOT RUB  4) I waited for about 15 min, bottle says no longer than 20 min  5) Wipe off with a dry towel (comes off easier than using a wet towel)   6) Rinse with warm water, do not use soap.    The hairs appeared weak and limp and they were, so they broke where the hair sticks out of the skin, leaving a good amount of stubble. Hair seems slightly thinner than original. Tried this on a test area in the bikini region. It worked but the results I&#x27;d give a C+ at most. I do recommend that you try it for yourself, products have various results since every person is unique.</li>
    <li> I purchased a tube of this 2 months ago. Tried it then, and wasn&#x27;t overly happy with the results. I thought I would give it another try yesterday. It did absolutely nothing. Checking the tube closer, I felt a crackling inside. The contents had separated and crystallized on the inside of the tube. As I squeezed the tube to break up the crystals, a few slivers broke through the tube. I contacted \\&quot;The Natural Health Shoppe\\&quot; and was told I couldn&#x27;t return it. I guess this stuff has a shelf life of about a week. So now not only won&#x27;t I ever purchase another \\&quot;Revitol\\&quot; product, but \\&quot;The Natural Health Shoppe\\&quot; will see no more business from me either.</li>
    <li> Male user. Used on hair on ear.  Used as instructed.   Absolutely no hair removal.  Unless I eventually have better luck, I will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on some reviews I saw on the internet.  I now believe those were plants.  I have used two tubes of this product and no results either time.  I have tried different suggestions I have read like apply warm water to the skin first, etc.  I left it on for up to 25 minutes.  Wipe it off and the hair is still there.  Wanted to give it my best shot so I used both tubes I purchased.  I thought I would try this because the Nair and Veet burn even when I use the sensitive skin formulas.  I&#x27;d rather do that.  At least it removes the hair and it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> On the website it tells you, you only need to put this on for a few minutes, but when you get it says about 15 minutes.  Even when you leave it on longer, it still does work!</li>
    <li> This product worked, for me, wonderfully. It removed the hair in a sensitive area in about 5 minutes. Easy to apply and easy on the skin. I had no trouble with this at all. You may need to use two applications for best results. This was exactly as described on the tube. I recommend this for all sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> not one hair was removed, it burned my skin, and it smelled bad.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
    <li> Tried five times using nearly a full tube each time. I purchased the multiple tube deal since the reviews were so convincing on their web sites. Very hard to remove the last half or product from the tube.  Totally worthless. The reviews couldn&#x27;t have been accurate. I left it on for the max time of 30 minutes my last and final try. Didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Beware, if you are knowledgeable about toxic ingredients,&lt;br /&gt;and you think the ingredients on this listing sound&lt;br /&gt;pleasing, visit the revitol website before purchasing,&lt;br /&gt;even though on their website, they show an image including&lt;br /&gt;the ingredients and the print may be hard to read, I definitely&lt;br /&gt;can read \\&quot;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, tried it and found that it is complete waste of money. What a disappointment. I&#x27;ll never buy again or recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use much cheaper hair removal creams with better results. When I got my two bottles, I was excited but that was short lived. They had some grainy stuff in there and I&#x27;m still not sure if it was just expired or hardening. It barely took out any hair and I had to use shaving sticks (which I was trying to avoid) to remove the hair. I continued to use it anyway and used the whole two tubes with no success. I left it on longer the second time and it worked a little bit but I still needed a second method. I tried it on my hands, on my feet and on my underarm and it just did not work. It is a complete waste of money! Use Veet or Nair instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a joint present for my wife and I to remove hair from her nether region.  The hope was that it would be effective and not burn her sensitive skin in that area (products like Nair appear to really burn those sensitive regions).  As advertised it did not burn AT ALL and it was effective at removing the hair.  It does smell and it does take 15 to 20 minutes but it works exactly as advertised..... painless and effective.</li>
    <li> There were a few comparisons and complaints on here about revitol&#x27;s effectiveness and it&#x27;s comparibility to nair.  I have used nair and it works but it can leave quite a bit of irritation and does not remove the hair all the way down. I chose revitol in hopes of having to do hair removal less over time.  It had a smell like nair, but it was pain free, removed all the hair, and left my skin smooth without the hair stubs.  Not only that but the hair didn&#x27;t grow back for weeks, and was alot less and thinner!! I am definately going to buy another bottle and continue use until hair hopefully stops completely.   Hope this helps!!!  :)</li>
    <li> This product had received really good reviews, but for me, I am not finding that it works any better that NAIR at 1/5th the cost! Will not purchase again, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!!!!!!!!!!!! It works just like promised. one tube is enough for legs two times, full brazillian, and some minor touch on facials :)</li>
    <li> I truly believe this product is a complete scam.  I have never felt so taken for money in my life. too bad i got 4 bottles. lesson learned... research the reviews for a product BEFORE you buy always!</li>
    <li> This stuff was over price and didn&#x27;t work!!! Would love to find something that would remove hair and keep the hair off for weeks!!!!</li>
    <li> I think I got some old hair removal cream or something because mine will not even come out the container!</li>
    <li> I not unhappy but it is really not that much better tan any other hair remover so if you like the price buy it...</li>
    <li> Not good for the private area. Can&#x27;t use it there. It gave me chemical burns. Then before I fully healed, hair started growing back again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with the hope that it would work better than other hair removal creams I have used.  When I received it, it had a broken bottle and cream was all over my package.  I was surprised when I read that the cream needed to be on for 20 minutes.  Nair only takes 3.  I tried it for 20 minutes and only a few hairs were removed!  I was shocked.  I then put on Nair and 3 minutes later, the hair was off.  I then read the ingredients and found that this overpriced revitol contained the same active ingredients as \\&quot;much cheaper\\&quot; hair removal products.  I was disappointed and wanted to get the full refund as the advertising for revitol has stated.  When I read the fine print, I found that there was a 10 dollar charge for each bottle!  That is a rediculous return policy.  I believe that this company is deceptively advertising a product that does not work any better than store products...in fact it is probably worse!</li>
    <li> ok in first place is pricey and i left it for 20 minutes just to make sure that it disolves everyting and at the end when i wipped out almost all the hair is still intact. As for now I stay with Olay Duo hair removal medium to corse hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hope of not having to wax anymore. I first used it like directed on the bottle and it did nothing at all, not even a single hair was removed. I thought the hair might have just been too thick, so i trimmed the area and tried again. I got the same results the second time, not a single hair was removed. I beleive this product is an expensive scam because it does not work.</li>
    <li> It left my skin stubbly, and if you leave it on too long it creates a rash&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> Heard much of the \\&quot;propaganda\\&quot; about this so I gave it a try.    Followed all the instructions. Even tried giving more time than it says is required. Nothing.        Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I am unable to use this product.  I tried a test area as the directions called for and I seem to be sensitive to the product.  It caused me to feel as though I had been burned and I needed to remove it prior to it removing any hair.</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t smell good, but that&#x27;s the least of my worries. Some of the cream was crystallized in the bottle, but it didn&#x27;t effect its use. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all like some other hair removal creams do, and left no rashes or red skin after I used it. It didn&#x27;t even burn the whole time I had it on, just gave me a sensation like mint would. Be sure to leave it on for the whole 15 minutes or it won&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve even left it on for 20+ without any bad reactions.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed after the first use, but after second go very pleased. Removed most of hair, no irritation although some was still left. Would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This will be a short and sweet review.  I tried this product three times starting at 13 minutes, then 18 then 23 and it did not remove a single strand of hair.  Other than smelling horrible and slightly irritating my skin I could find no discernable effect.  I was using it on my legs.  Back to the trusty razor!</li>
    <li> read the heading im not going to go into further detail. it stinks to, so dont expect flowers when you apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m unable to use other hair removal creams. My skin immediately burns every time. I just Revitol on my face for 3 minutes and it removed ever hair and didn&#x27;t burn my skin at all!!!</li>
    <li> I bought 6 bottles and three bottles have broken pumps and the creme is crystalized inside. I couldn&#x27;t test all the remaining bottles because of their ridiculous refund policy. If you put the crystalized creme on your skin, it ends up scratching your body. As the other review rightly says, it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair even when it is left on the skin for 20 mins. I asked for a full refund five days ago and I still haven&#x27;t received a response. I strongly urge you to re-consider buying this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once and was not impressed.  I used it on my legs and have course thick hair.  It did not remove all of the hair, in fact perhaps only about 30% of it over an extended amt of time...25min.  Perhaps, I need to use a larger quantity of it, but then this bottle will be done in about 4 applications.</li>
    <li> I have thin blonde hair and store brands never worked for me, but this does! Its stinks somethin awful and sometimes you get bottles with cyrstalized shards in them but it will work. The but is, that \\&quot;some hair\\&quot; will not grow back each time you use it, but it takes a long long time to stop every hair from growing back. If I had known it takes so long, I would&#x27;ve gotten an epilator sooner. I can&#x27;t use an epilator on my under arms nor private area so I use Revitol on them. Now, if you leave it on your private area too long, it will burn. At least, it does for me.  They changed the formulation about 4-5 months ago, and now I can&#x27;t use it on my face, or it will leave red marks, that look &amp; feel like burns, which I have to treat with neosporin. But when used on my arms &amp; legs, it&#x27;s always fine. So it seems like some of these hair removers will work on some, but not others. Give it a try, but use caution!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was billed as gentle to the skin. I have used nair cream for the face before and had a slight irritation, but NOTHING like this product caused. I felt like I needed to hide for a few days. Literally burned my skin in patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this product. It did remove hair, but the cost was much too high. Can&#x27;t imagine that they bill this product as gentle.</li>
    <li> The product was somewhat difficult to wipe off.  Directions claim you should use a paper towel and I have resorted to using a towel because it is rougher and will actually rub the cream off.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after doing alot of research about hair removal products. I have sensitive skin and it is difficult for me to shave constantly and I am not really into waxing or have the funds for laser hair removal. I figured this would be a nice alternative to the pharmacy products such as Nair, etc...  I was wrong, I did the patch test as indicated and waited 5 minutes as per the bottle, I still had some hair so I figured that I would leave it on the full leg for the entire 7 minutes indicated as a max. when I went to rub the creme off you cannot simply use a towel because the cream is dry so I wet my legs and did as instructed and a bit of the hair was removed small patches here and there but I wound up having to pick up the razor to finish off because as the product indicates you have to wait 24hrs before applying again.  I put one coat of the cream, I will try it again applying a heavy dosage as to coat my leg like you would a cupcake to see if that works but even then it would not be worth it because half the tub would be gone in one use just for your legs and its costly. So I will try the pharmacy brand hair removers at least its less expensive. Hope this helps someone else.</li>
    <li> This item works better than any other hair removal cream I have tried I would recommend , I have some coarse dark hair and it does remove it.</li>
    <li> this hair removal cream does what its intended to do with no hassle or mess makes shaving or not shaving &amp;#34;hahaha&amp;#34; of course no razor a snap</li>
    <li> I read most of the negative reviews but I didnt mind them so much and still bought it and it does NOT work.</li>
    <li> I tried it today after getting it so far so good.  If I don&#x27;t break out will use this for life!!!!</li>
    <li> Same active ingredient as over the counter products.  Counldn&#x27;t see the need for this specialized one.  Could be gentler, but didn&#x27;t really try it to compare.</li>
    <li> Results are no better than any other products I have tried. Disappointed.  Will stick with drug store brands in the future.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for so much more from this product.  I was hugely disappointed with the end result.  The end result being absolutely NO hair removal whatsoever. Applied product to one underarm to test.  Left product on the maximum allowed time.  Wiped product off as described, what was left was exactly what I started with.  I truely wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my money.  Went out and bought Veet at my local CVS.  Followed the package directions and wala my hair was removed.  It did burn a bit but I did get the end results I was hoping for.  Do NOT order Revitol, check your local stores for a much cheaper and more effective product.</li>
    <li> I am not big on using removal cream but this one seems to be as good as any. I still get the rash that I was hoping to avoid.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works great. This is my second bottle. I would recommend this product to anyone. I have tried others and none work like Revitol.</li>
    <li> do not buy from this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. they have a no cancel policy. if you mistakenly order something , you cant remove it.&lt;br /&gt;2. they add insurance and a ridiculous shipping charge to the order. (8 bucks for one tube)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t know (and now don&#x27;t care) how well the product works. when the company treats you that way, you go in the other direction.</li>
    <li> THIS REVIEW IS STRICTLY ONLY FOR THE ONE&#x27;S ASSOCIATED WITH MAKING THE HAIR REMOVAL CREAM AND NOT THE SELLER.NOT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SELLER BUT YES WITH THE PRODUCT.PLEASE DO A THOROUGH RESEARCH AND THEN BUY A PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I tried this product with so much hope for my stubborn chin hairs that create ingrowns and dark spots.  I followed the directions to the T and the stubborn hairs remained while my skin rubbed off creating little scraped sores  I was soooo suprised because I thought that the product was supposed to weaken the hair follicle to create less hair hair growth overall. ):</li>
    <li> Revitol is good,the first time i used it it was painful you really have to do a patch test ..it burnt my skin badly but was my fault it is very strong and as soon as it starts burning u have to wash it off even if hair wasnt removed because it will leave scar and literally burn your skin off but scars do go away after a while for me was a month after and i used it again during that time, it does get rid of hair nicely and NO hair bumps at all and im a very hairy person with coarse hair that was always troubled by hair bumps, there are limited hair growth on my upper lips and only used it 3 times so far, hair is barely there but my chin is sligthly different hair was removed well the first time but it doesnt remove the hair properly after my second use hair grows back fast but i use it anyway because no hair bumps,its really gud else where too,oh and it doesnt burn anymore</li>
