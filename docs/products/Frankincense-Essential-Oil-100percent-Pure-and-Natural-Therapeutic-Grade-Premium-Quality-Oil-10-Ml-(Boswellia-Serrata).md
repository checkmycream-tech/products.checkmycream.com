<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. Side by side with other, similar brands, I can tell the difference in the strong Frankincense fragrance! I&#x27;ve already added it to my home made skin cream.</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  I&#x27;ve gone through two bottles and am on my third. My mother has also started using it.  I dilute and apply it to my face and also take a drop or two in a glass of water.</li>
    <li> Really good price and wonderful product</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED MY FRANKY OIL QUICKLY AND ON TIME.&lt;br /&gt;i am new to the oil products.  i never had frankincense before.  i like the smell of franky.  i have found that some oils have&lt;br /&gt;a multi use for them which is interesting.  MEMO:  asmwmr thank you..//..//..//</li>
    <li> Love this oil in my diffuser.</li>
    <li> I received the oils very fast, and my husband has been using the Frankincense,  I have used the Eucalyptus in my diffuser and the Tea tree on a burn I got from my curling iron.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Does&#x27;nt smell as good as other frankincense oils :( but ok.</li>
    <li> to me it smells a bit like rosemary.  I was expecting something more earthy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell right to me. But I&#x27;ve only used doterra oil.</li>
    <li> still confused as to WHY this product is so cheap compared to its expensive counterparts... will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> So I love the company and their oils I have the lavender oil and book and it works wonderfully. I got frankincense because it&#x27;supposed to be a healing oil. The book though doesn&#x27;t explain how to use it because it has to be diluted which I find kind of odd because other frankincense oil can be used by themselves.  I&#x27;m new to the oils so I&#x27;m having a hard time using this one but besides that I&#x27;ve had a great experience with this company. Not sure how to access all my free ebooks on the website either.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, smells great,  works well in my atomizer and I got a free oil ebook with it! It arrived quickly also!</li>
    <li> Yet another awesome oil from WellnessScent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma of this oil is very well balanced... its soothing and very uplifting!&lt;br /&gt;Diffuse at night to help relax and go to sleep and than use it diffused on your face in the morning to feel vibrant and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil does wonders for your skin! You simply have to see it for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;Its a true royal experience when introduced into your spa day! :)</li>
    <li> First class service. Great product, so far. I am new to using EO but what I do know is the importance of buying a quality product that is unadulterated and is as close to the natural plant sans chemicals.</li>
    <li> The oil is good quality and a great value.</li>
    <li> True to its scent. Shipped out immediately, so I didn&#x27;t even have to wait!</li>
    <li> I love the frankincense oil ; this oil seemed to be more potent. So I reduced the number of drops I used to apply to my facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I just received the oils and must have ebook before use.</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner. Love the product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is very thin, so I blend it with a few carrier oils like, Argan, Jojoba and Emu for everything from acne to sore joints. Package arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent and never even smelled Frankincense before. Too bad my diffuser quit working (lights) after only 6 days. Now, Amazon is stating it cannot be returned. The diffuser cost $50.00. So small and not effective. Please read my review on the diffuser. This oil is wonderful and glad I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I like using this for deodorant. Works 4 me.</li>
    <li> Pure scent...exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Yeaaaiii I have received my Frankensence oil and it is absolutely wonderful. Packaged securely and arrived on time. In purchasing this wonderfully scented oil I was/am also privy to an essential oil E-book and I am excited about them both. I look forward to ordering more oils from WellnesScent.</li>
    <li> Great service and product.</li>
    <li> It is a very high quality oil.  It works very well with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I use this certified organic  Frankincense Essential Oil for my stiffness caused by arthritis &amp; fibromyalgia.&lt;br /&gt;I put three or four drops into a GLASS drinking cup with water &amp; drink it 2x A day.&lt;br /&gt;This has helped my morning stiffness go from a ten to a two unless I forget to take it for several days.&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: you cannot ingest any essential oil that is not certified Organic!  This oil is certified organic.</li>
    <li> The oil is exactly what I wanted and I have alread noticed a difference.  I whipped it up with some coconut oil to make a night cream and my skin has never looked better.  It smells and performs just like the Young Living oil that I have used before and was a fraction of the price.  The shipping was fast and this is a seller who goes the extra mile.</li>
    <li> I have another brand of frankincense and it does not smell like this one.  This has a slight urine smell to it.  I am only using it topically.  I use the other brand in water.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  One of the benefits of Frankincense Essential Oil is it is good to rub on if you have cancer.  It can help the cancer not to spread.  I started using it when I got esophageal cancer.  I use it in a diffuser also.</li>
    <li> The best Frankincense!</li>
    <li> This frank has a nice deep scent, one of the best I&#x27;ve used. My only issue is the reducer! It practically pours out instead of drop by drop. I ended up popping it off and replacing it with an old one I had from an empty bottle.</li>
    <li> Just got it today and WOW, very potent, smells lovely.  Haven&#x27;t used it in anything yet, mostly because I&#x27;m enjoying popping it open and sniffing it every five minutes.  If you are looking for Frankincense EO, look no further.</li>
    <li> A good value for this type of oil. This is generally a very expensive oil. I have seen this oil do some pretty miraculous things!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this for acne. She gets pretty upset when she runs out... She says it works. I like it for my face for a anti aging serum before my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Product arrived timely.  Product as advertised.  Using it to diffuse for a Border Collie currently fighting cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only comment would be a smaller mailing box.  For one bottle of oil -- maybe a smaller box -- less resource use.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance !!  Enjoying!!</li>
    <li> If you are a bicyclist, this works great for saddle sores, blisters, boils.</li>
    <li> I love the light fragrance and have purchased two more bottles. I rub the oil on my feet once or twice a day to handle internal infection and candida overgrowth. It&#x27;s made an amazing difference. My bloating symptoms are greatly reduced! I&#x27;ll definitely continue to buy this product since it has a worked so well on my issues.</li>
    <li> I give it an A+.  This Frankincense smells a little different than the two brands I normally use, and it makes a nice cologne.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Quick on delivery.</li>
    <li> Just got my order today and did a smell test between Doterra oil and your Wellness Scent brand. Your Frankincense has a stronger scent and I really like that. Thanks I will be ordering from you again for sure.</li>
    <li> This came in a timely fashion. My only concern is it pours out of the bottle instead of one drop at a time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughters ganglion cyst.  Honestly did not see a difference after using it a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Bought this oil extremely pleased with quality</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised well packaged and smells like the uber expensive MLM company oils I have on hand. Cost was so much less.</li>
    <li> My life is very stressful.  I suffer from depression, insomni and often get anxiety attacks that have sent me to the emergency room on numerous occasions?  First, I&#x27;d like to say that the shipping was super fast.  Secondly, I received this oil, went to dr. mercola&#x27;s website which gives so many uses for this oil.  I applied a couple of drops into my hands with organic coconut oil and inhaled it.  I also proceeded to apply one drop behind my ears.  After about 10 min. My body relaxed to the point that made me fall asleep.  It has been weeks since I relaxed so much.  The only draw back is that while pouring the oil, it comes out too fast, however, I gave it 5 stars because it&#x27;s the inside that counts.  I&#x27;d like to thank my awesome God, Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for leaving us the wonderful gift of nature.</li>
    <li> help with daily feelings,  just gives a calm affect over my house...jul</li>
    <li> The product seems fine, it is me who has a hard time with the odor of this botanical.</li>
    <li> Received item fast and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I received my order just fine. Do you make it in a larger bottle? I use it on my face and hand that was injured and it helpse releave the pain I thank-you for  your concern and my God bless your business and I pray He is the Lord over all your life.  &amp;#34;If He&#x27;s not Lord of all He&#x27;s not Lord at  all!&amp;#34;  God Bless Bonnie</li>
    <li> Amazing customer service and great product, the oil arrived perfectly packed and right on time. Can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
    <li> never had a bad expierence</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Delivered very quickly, and I&#x27;ve never had better customer service.</li>
    <li> Has a nice smell! Seems like a nice quality oil for a fraction of the price I have been paying.  I will be ordering this item again. Company is very good to work with and great about making sure you receive your product!</li>
    <li> I have yet to use it for all of the purposes for which I bought it but i use it on my skin daily and it is amazing.  I do mix it with a carrier oil on my face. I  used to use the carrier oil on my face but it left my face feeling a bit oily and i had to wait to put my makeup on.  When I add the Frankincense to it now it blends right in and softens my skin after the first use.  My mother uses it in her Greenair Spa Mist Therapy unit and it helps her relax and go into a deeper meditation.  We both love it!  I just wish it came in bigger bottles but after seeing how they harvest it, I am surprised we are able to get as much as we do.</li>
    <li> Got my Frankincense and I love it. Great product. Will definitely buy more from your company.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and was quality oil!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd order from this company, the first time I ordered tea tree oil. My package came fast like before. I am very impressed by this company. They answer any questions you have and are great. Even if I found oils from different sellers, I would stick to this company for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my oil arrived yesterday I was sick in bed so I didn&#x27;t open it until this morning. The smell is wonderful! I had a pounding headache this morning from allergies so I thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try this oil on my temples. I just dabbed a little on my finger and rubbed my temples deep. Within minutes my headache is lifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not say enough great things about these oils and this company, I am a forever customer and can not wait to build my collection of essential oils through them. Many thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> not too mild, not too strong, yay for organic, good price on sale, dispenser works fine, yay glass bottle--thanks!</li>
    <li> It aided in healing some sores on my arm</li>
    <li> This essential oil meets up to my expectations as a pure product. Its a beautiful oil that all aroma lovers should have. It arrived in a timely manner and I will definitely be using this seller again.</li>
    <li> Just received it. Thank you</li>
    <li> This was a great experience and customer services was also wonderful</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this oil.  It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like DoTERRA Frankincense, but I was willing to give it a chance.  Either the bottle wasn&#x27;t filled all the way, or the oil evaporates.  But after only trying it one night, and then pouring some in a 2ml bottle for a friend to try, I only had enough to dab on once more, and then the bottle was completely empty.  Amazon did give me a refund, but save the headache and don&#x27;t order in the first place.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and wonderful</li>
    <li> Awesome, flawless transaction</li>
    <li> Got here fast and I love it will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This Frankincense oil does not smell as pleasing as the one I purchased from a different company.  I do like it.  I simply liked the other one better.  However, I do realize that this depends on the location it is harvested and the time.  I can tell that it does a great job on facial skin issues already.  I would recommend it.  The service from this company is excellent.  I ordered several things a got them all quickly and accurately.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase.  The frankincense oil looks and smells pure,  beer than another brand I purchased at a much higher cost.  I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Yes I received my frankincense oil.  It arrived in perfect condition.  I no your not asking about my argan oil but I received it a couple of days later the bottle was damp like it had a small leak.  I keep the top tight and keep it in a zip lock bag.</li>
    <li> Thank you! Just got it. Can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
    <li> Have been very pleased with the quality of this oil..will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful and it works great for my severe, chronic joint and muscle pain. This is the best frankincense essential oil I have found and it&#x27;s organic, too!</li>
    <li> Really good product as far as I can tell. I&#x27;ve never used Frankincense before. This has a nice scent and seems strong. Arrived on Time.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> This has really helped my scare by my nose, love it</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. The product is excellent. I use it with my skin regimen. So pure I can even use it with my eye cream. My skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> I just received this product and hope it is as amazing as all the reviews listed on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised. Well packaged.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to help fade some dark pigmentation on my face.  I add a couple of drops of oil to my moisturizer. The oil absorbs readily when applied in this manner and has a pleasant herbal scent. I&#x27;ve been using the oil for a couple of weeks and I have noticed a subtle fading of the dark pigmentation.  I have also noticed that my skins feels more hydrated since I started using it.</li>
    <li> First time and enjoy it</li>
    <li> This oil is by far one of the best I&#x27;ve used. I received my order the second day after ordering....The e-books are very informative....I am one happy customer!</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I purchase Frankincense and I am glad I did.  I want you to know that my knowledge about essential oils is very minimal so I am only writing this review based on my humble experience with it.  I use the oil mainly for meditation (grounding and purpose), which I practice twice a day for 30 minutes.  Before I set my practice, I take the little bottle and I bring it right to my nostrils.  Then, I deeply inhale the aroma and I exhale through my mouth (I repeat this 3 times).  If I need to interpret the aroma, I will say that it has a sweet and woodsy feeling to it.  It almost reminds me of the smell of pines in a warm summer night...but not quite.  I truly enjoy my experience of the Frankincense oil during meditation.  Now that I have fallen in love with its charming and mysterious scent, I know I will buy more.  By the way,  I have to say that the seller&#x27;s customer care was stellar from the very beginning.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that most essential oils on Amazon kinda make me nervous.  They&#x27;re sold in huge bottles for prices so cheap that a reputable EO company couldn&#x27;t possibly stay in business if they&#x27;re harvesting quality oils and not adulterating them with carrier oils or synthetics.  If you look up the Blue Tansy FB group, it has a lot of helpful information and independent third-party test results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the purity of WellnesScent&#x27;s products, as I am not a chemist.  However, a couple things give me more confidence in this product than most of the others from Amazon that I&#x27;ve received to evaluate &amp; review.&lt;br /&gt;  1. The product page actually states the country AND region where their plants are farmed/cultivated - they&#x27;re not buying from some shady source in China or India that can&#x27;t even tell them where the oil comes from.  The bottle also tells you not only the method of extraction, but what part(s) of the plant was used!&lt;br /&gt;  2. The price per ounce is actually a reasonable one that could allow them to make a living off it.  For example, Plant Therapy is another Amazon brand that HAS been shown through third-party testing to have quality pure oils.  The WellnesScent product is comparable to that.  And oils that cost more to produce (e.g. Frankincense) are priced higher accordingly, unlike some other brands on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not entirely convinced, however.  This Frankincense smells very close to pure frankincense, very woody and rich and piney.  However it&#x27;s a little off, and has a faint chemical/artificial scent to it, as if it&#x27;s had a synthetic fragrance added, or been mixed with other oils such as tea tree oil.  This raises the concern of what else might have been added too!  (The other oil I&#x27;ve received from WellnesScent, Lavender, likewise has a faint chemical/artificial scent to it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I can&#x27;t vouch for their purity, I do feel more confident using these oils than most others.  These are probably fine for aromatherapy, but I would be careful with topical use, and NO internal use!!  I am giving them three stars for being better than most but not beyond all doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes: they come in the typical amber bottle with euro dropper, which properly dispenses only a drop at a time (instead of pouring out like some lids I&#x27;ve tried).  They were securely packaged in bubble wrap and come with a free eBook, which is always nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product in exchange for testing, inspecting and reviewing it.  I received no other compensation for my review and always give my honest and unbiased opinion of each product.  I welcome your questions &amp; comments on my experience.al use, and NO internal use!!

    <li> I love this essential oil.  I just put a few drops in a warm bath and was able to feel the stress melting away.  This is a great essential oil and I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I had been using another brand of Frankincense prior to buying this product, and although I saw some evidence it was working on a suspicious-looking growth that appeared on my arm, it was a slow process. When I purchased this one and began applying it, the difference in quality was very evident. This certified organic Boswellia Serrata (Frankincense) is head and shoulders above any other Boswellia essential oil I have used. It is extracted from the resin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It emits a wonderful, and strong aroma when diffused, unlike the other brand. This moderately priced product is worth much more than the expensive brands on the market. I will stick with this brand for my future Frankincense essential oil needs.  I HIGHLY recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to add that if you are in a hurry for this product, shipping is very slow. I reordered and both times I would have completely run out if I did not have a backup bottle of Frankincense to continue my treatment uninterrupted. If you can wait 10 days for your shipment then it is worth it.</li>
    <li> The product is great, smells wonderful, great customer service. Unfortunately the plastic dropper inside the bottle was malfunctioning, when I went to drop a few drops a whole bunch poured out. It&#x27;s a very strong oil so 1 drop is enough for an entire bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent Service.  Item arrived quickly!!!  I can definitely tell the difference between this brand and other non organic brands!!!  It has a very warm and earthy scent. Very nice.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> great Frankincense essential oil. I use this particular essential oil a lot and find this particular brand to work well with good scent and outcome.  I am a massage therapist and use this oil with my massage and love it so far, good recommendation from me.</li>
    <li> Lovely - like the frankincense I had in Oman.</li>
    <li> smells pungent very unpleasant</li>
    <li> Just got it.  Friend of mine recently tried Frankincense from another company.  She said the smell was so offensive that she would only be able to use it if she combined it with other essential oils.  I found the Organic Frankincense from your company has a lovely aroma.  It has a pleasant aroma and  I can easily use it all by itself.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I received a card for a free ebook with info about my new oil.  was not able to locate it on the website given.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in a timely manner and was what I expected.  It smells wonderful and cut with another oil, really works for arthritis pain in my hands and knees!</li>
    <li> WellnesScent did an excellent job with on-time delivery in a size-appropriate box! They followed through with a friendly, personal email and an offer for some free online books about essential oils. I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and will order from WelnesScent again in the future. Thanks for a super experience!</li>
    <li> I received it! I need to find a carrier oil now!!!</li>
    <li> It smells good and seems to be working on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil, I love it. Received  it so fast , it&#x27;s  an  awesome  oil and company.  They always check on you to make sure your happy and satisfied with  your  purchase  and delivery.</li>
    <li> My frankincense oil order, was perfect, perfect time and perfect product, thank you !!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this line. Pure, organic and inexpensive! Why pay $93 when you can get the same for a fraction of the price? Love it and about to download my free eBook.</li>
    <li> High quality at an excellent price! Arrived on time and in perfect condition. Will definitely be a return customer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Frankincense Essential Oil from WellnesScent because I have heard good things about this oil. I have been using it in a diffuser to help relieve anxiety and stress. It has a kind of spicy, woody smell that is a little bit sweet. It is calming and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;It pours a bit quickly when you tip the bottle to release some oil. Most of the dispensers on my other brands of oils are not like this. So, I have to remind myself before I use it so I don&#x27;t waste it.&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense seems to alleviate my sinus pressure from my allergies. I have only been using this for a few days, but I haven&#x27;t had nearly the pressure in that time. Over all, I like this oil and feel like it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this Frankincense Essential Oil at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I love the oils  I haven&#x27;t been able to log in to read how to use but I rub it on my temples and neck  sometime on my knees  thank you  I have been fighting cancer since 2008  any other info you might have would be appreciated</li>
    <li> Quick shipment.  Quality scent</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for diffusion and topical application</li>
    <li> Pretty good oil but the container it comes in is a huge problem. When you tip it upside down to release some oil, it comes pouring out. Most of the dispensers companies use for these pure oils, or for any kind of essential oil, are made to release the oil slowly so it doesn&#x27;t all come out at once. Not so with this brand. I&#x27;ve already wasted about 1/4 of the product having used it two times because of this design flaw. And it&#x27;s nearly impossible to remember this issue when you pour it because it just isn&#x27;t something you would expect. Company needs to fix this. You might save money on the price compared to other oils, but you will waste more oil due to this issue.</li>
    <li> I wasted no time putting my Frankincense in my diffuser and I love it! My home smells wonderful and it&#x27;s so calming. By far better then other companies I&#x27;ve tried. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My favorite scent. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my oil. Thank you for the e-books so informative. I did receive my oil in a timely matter. Thank!</li>
    <li> Good and potent.  Helps with my moods and skin.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I received my Frankincense oil in a timely manor and I am very pleased with the oil. I started using it as soon as I got it and like it as much as the ones that are much more money. Thank you for this quality oil.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and the oil was great</li>
    <li> Excellent company A++++++</li>
    <li> very good oil like it very much</li>
    <li> Great product! I will buy from Wellness scent again for sure!</li>
    <li> very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> this oil arrived over 1/2 empty &amp; there was no sign of spillage in the packaging. It also smells off. I&#x27;ve just this brand a lot &amp; this opened bottle smells really off. Prob because who knows how long this been opened. :(</li>
    <li> Love this essential oil! Top quality! Just started using it I will update later on how it works for me.</li>
    <li> I had to order this oil after i saw what it is doing for my Granddaughter&#x27;s scars.  They seem to be disappearing quicker than anything that I have ever tried on scars.  I&#x27;m hoping that it will do the same for me and a few of my scars!</li>
    <li> FAST DELIVERY!!&#x27; Wow, I was impressed. I used my prime benefit for delivery in 2-days...It arrived at my house in 1-day....I&#x27;m very happy about that and can&#x27;t wait to try the product. It&#x27;s 100% pure &amp; organic just as was advertised. 😄&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My update this review later after I&#x27;ve tried the product.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me.I had a bottle given to me I put a little dab on every night and in 3days I had no pain.Cheaper does not work for this product You have to have the real thing.I am sure it is a good product it just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like other frankincense</li>
    <li> I am trying this on a skin cancer and it&#x27;s actually shrinking!  I do have a dermatologist also I have had many skin cancers on my face.</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic for skin. I love the way my skin looks and feels after using Frankincense with my moisturizer. Evens out any discoloration and brightens my overall appearance. Would never be without this oil again.</li>
    <li> Great product, fair price, fast service!</li>
    <li> The oils arrived perfectly packaged and are as good as advertised. Thank you WellnesScent</li>
    <li> love the smell of this oil! it is very relaxing oil to defuse in the house.</li>
    <li> only leaving 4 star because of the short amount of time I have has this product : So far it seems a very good product , has good aroma , blends well and has been working on my brown spots  , Frankincense is my go to oil</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality oil and heals cuts and scrapes expertly.</li>
    <li> I love Frankincense Essential Oil.  First I love the smell and second I love that it helps with acne and boils. I get boils sometimes and they are painful and annoying using this oil really helps. I put the oil on when I first feel something coming on and it shortens the length of the boil and calms it down so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much. I like that the oil doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film on my cloths. I would recommend this product. I was given a slight discount to review this product.</li>
    <li> enjoying this product - good price.</li>
    <li> I use it with wintergreen oil for my cervical cancer. Hope it will shrink as I heard from a friend. I am trying everything.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I mix a few drops in coconut oil and use it as a moisturizer for my face and then to remove my make up at night.  Put a tiny bit in my hand, then mix in my foundation and it goes on so smooth.  It smells wonderful and is way less than expensive than the brands that are really MLM which is why they charge so much.</li>
    <li> Perfect oil! I got it for my face and have been pleased with its excellent performance firming up my &amp;quot;mature&amp;quot; skin (it&#x27;s really old skin!). A big bonus is the way it healed both a cat scratch that had become slightly infected and a torn, bleeding cuticle that responded to nothing.  Less than 24 hours after I applied it to the scratch the redness was gone and the scratch was closing; the cuticle took a day and a half before it healed, but heal it did. I will be keeping this in my bathroom for first aid and beauty needs.</li>
    <li> It shipped very quickly and I love it!  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but the free ebook explained many ways to use the oil which I will be trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Received oil very quickly. Enjoying it as this is my 4th or 5th bottle. Just wish bottles were larger.</li>
    <li> Certified Organic Frankincense Essential Oil at a super price, item shipped quickly and smells great!</li>
    <li> I love the anti-inflammatory properties of Frankincense and use it on many of my massage therapy clients.</li>
    <li> I just received this, but have not used it yet.  While it smells good, it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as my other doTerra brand.  I really like that product, but I will use this one and give it a good try.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wonderful !  Hoping it does the trick of fading my dark spots......</li>
    <li> Great product and very good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping it would get rid of the ganglion cyst in my wrist, and although it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of the cyst after a few days of use, I still love the oil and all the other awesome uses for it. And I&#x27;ll keep putting it on the cyst and hopefully it will still help with that.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, smells great and works wonders alone or in my lotions.</li>
    <li> The very first week after using the oil my skin changed 100% for the better. I use 2 drops organic jojoba oil, 2 drops organic aloe vera gel, and 1 drop of frankincense, all mixed together as a moisturizer before bed. By the end of the first bottle, most of my acne scars have diminished, super smooth texture, and it even prevented me from getting more acne breakouts. I don&#x27;t think that I could live without this oil. The quality is superior, the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Even the company behind the oil is great. I received a call shortly after getting my first bottle asking how I was enjoying the product and they let me know of a free e book on the website. The e book was quite helpful for a beginner such as myself.</li>
    <li> all set .nice product</li>
    <li> Great item, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner.  Just recently received &amp; have only used once so cannot comment other than to say... no issues or concerns so far!</li>
    <li> This item is not 100% pure frankincense . The label is misleading and allowed. The young living or doterra are pure oil go with those companies. The inferior product just a waste of money:(</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, just started using for skin tags we will see how it works.</li>
    <li> Received this product nice and quick!!!</li>
    <li> I dont like reviews but the seller seemed very concerned that I got what I ordered and that I was satisfied, which I did and am. I also took a look at the &amp;#34;ebook&amp;#34; link included and learned a few things. Ill keep this source for future oil needs</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product. High quality for money.</li>
    <li> I have read there is a difference between Pure oils and Essential oils. I thought I was buying Essential oils but it says no where on the bottle  Essential oil. Was a bit disappointed and can&#x27;t use this for what I wanted it for. Otherwise I love the smell and will use it in other ways .</li>
    <li> I received my oil..was in great shape.</li>
    <li> It arrive on time and so far it&#x27;s good I would recommend it to everyone good product</li>
    <li> High quality and great price. I have used many more expensive brands and this one works just as good as the more expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;Rose</li>
    <li> Item arrived very quickly as described - no complaints!</li>
    <li> Worked out very well.  Great clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is the dropper dispenser is a little crude, so measuring is a bit tough.</li>
    <li> Not as diluted as other oils I have used &amp; I only have to use 1/2 the amount as normal/</li>
    <li> I have been using and purchasing frankincense oil from many different suppliers and brands as I have been teaching aromatherapy for over 15 years. Fantastic product quality for a reasonable price- organic and undiluted.  I plan to refer all my students and clients to Wellness Scent.</li>
    <li> Great company and great product.  I will use them again and again.  Trustworthy and highly recommended. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Good product.  I have found a better price since ordering this one</li>
    <li> It appears to be an excellent product.  Have just used it for a few days.</li>
    <li> To use the words from WellnesScent &amp;#34;There are lots of types of Frankincense oil, maybe you are used to boswellia carteri or maybe a mix like some brands sell, this oil is 100% pure Boswellia serrata.&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t realize this distinction and was surprised by the scent of the oil because it wasn&#x27;t the same as the one I just emptied. After contacting the company they gave me a full refund with less than a day. I am SOOOO impressed with their &amp;#34;5 Star&amp;#34; Customer Service!</li>
    <li> I love this. Compares with YL and Doterra. I am back to order another while extremely awesome sale price is still good. I love YL and don&#x27;t often go anywhere outside of the trusted name, so glad I tried this.  It&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> Just received my order</li>
    <li> Boswellia serrata is a plant that produces Indian frankincense, Salai, referred to in Sanskrit as shallaki and in Latin as Olibanum Indicum.The plant is native to much of India and the Punjab region that extends into Pakistan. Frankincense is tapped from the scraggy but hardy trees by slashing the bark, which is called striping, and allowing the exuded resin to bleed out and harden. These hardened resins are called tears. There are several species and varieties of frankincense trees, each producing a slightly different type of resin. Differences in soil and climate create even more diversity of the resin, even within the same species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense serrata essential oil is made from resin of Boswellia serrata and hydro-distilled by an old traditional technique from distillers in India.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What You Get: (1) 10 ml Boswellia Serrata Essential Oil in a Dark Amber Bottle, with Black Plastic Cap.

This frankincense has very astringent qualities, juniper was one of the main notes, I found there to be some very striking smoky overtones as well.  Such a contrast from Boswellia Carteri (African Frankincense) - which has a more well rounded, spicy with ginger-like profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ &#x27;100% USDA Certified. Pesticide free.

    <li> I am a new user of essential oils, but I did research a lot of different products and chose this one from WellnesScent, I have only had them a few days and have used it in a diffuser and in a carrier oil for topical use, so far they are proving to  be excellent. I recommend this product, I feel I can trust this oil to be as it was written up to be. Very happy with my purchase. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I purchases this for some Ganglion Cysts on my body also for age spots and my face, not to mention all my arthritic  only used it a few days nothing has happened so far but I have high hope did receive my E- book complements of the company thank you for that ..It smell very therapeutic and relaxing, not sure what Frankincense suppose to smell like because I have never purchased before looking forward to the future with it I have arthritis all over my body so I have big hope for it .</li>
    <li> Dripper top was broken and it didn&#x27;t smell good. It also irritated my skin, it took a while for me start feeling it but by then it was to late to really wash it all off. Even if the dripper worked, I would still return it base on smell.</li>
    <li> Everything has been as advertised, I like the aroma and the price was great! I&#x27;ll have to use it for a while to see how much it benefits me though.</li>
    <li> Using for sleep and wrinkles. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I have been using it nightly a few drops massaged into the soles of my feet, then lotion over it. The peeling and eczema on my feet have disappeared. That was why I bought the Frankincense. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good uplifting oil for the spirit.Thank you.</li>
    <li> used it with emu oil and my basal cell carcinoma disappeared</li>

    <li> 100% organic grade excellent product very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Received product very quickly from seller. Very pleased. Can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> I use many of the essential oils from Wellness Scent and they&#x27;ve never let me down. Frankincense, which most people only know because of its reference around Christmas, is actually an amazing e-oil for relaxing, de-stressing and clearing your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with every other purchase I&#x27;ve made from this company I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this oil.  It&#x27;s organic of course, incredibly potent and will absolutely be one of your favorites if you get it.  I&#x27;m very pleased, as usual, and will certainly be back for more in the future.  Highly recommended product and company from a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Love what it&#x27;s done on blemish. You can&#x27;t assume same effect for yourself as everyone is different.</li>
    <li> This essential oil is frankincense boswellia serrata from India 100% pure organic. I bought it at a great price buy one get one free during this december month. The oil is very aromatic by itself. If you decide to apply it to your skin it blends really good with a carrier oil such as 100% avocado oil. It is truly relaxing and mystical. I did not give the five stars to this item because I have tried Nature own essential oil and doterra which I consider excellent oils. I buy most of my Frankincense and other essential oils from nature&#x27;s own. tried to buy this oil again a few days after the promotion and it was back to its regular price which is very affordable.</li>
    <li> This is the best quality frankincense I&#x27;ve found at this price.</li>
    <li> love this oil and love this company. Fast delivery and an excellent price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time. Safely packed, no leaking. Very nice product. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Smells very similar to my YL living oil.  Still not sure if it is the same quality, but I&#x27;m excited to give it a try.  I use Frankincense for tag removal and it works great.  So I&#x27;m hoping this brand works for that.</li>
    <li> Great essential oil with a historical results recorded back in biblical time and it works for me!</li>
    <li> Its o.k . it IS essential oil , not mixed with a carrier oil , so that is truth .  the grade of essential oil is o.k.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it is Organic. This is the first time I have purchased Frankincense Essential Oil. It does smell a bit woodsy. I was going to try this for some inflammation that I am having. I have no problems smelling it right out of the bottle. I do not know much about essential oils except I love how they smell. I will have to get back to you on how it works out for me.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a cheaper alternative to DoTerra Frankincense that I have been using and enjoying.  Although this is labeled as 100% pure and organic, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the DoTerra Frankincense.  It has an unpleasant, sharp note that is not present in the DoTerra (which I guess I am using as the gold standard).  The scent is off-putting and I would not repurchase.  I think you really get what you pay for with essential oils.  The other brand is a LOT pricier but the two are very different.  I really don&#x27;t even see how they can be the same thing.</li>
    <li> Works on fire ant bites, as well as mosquito bites for my little one.</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF, GREAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> Great pungency, works wonders. On 2 separate occasions now, I&#x27;ve applied frankincense directly to my skin to remove warts. Takes time, but the &amp;#34;no side-effects&amp;#34; method is the way to go :)&lt;br /&gt; Also, works great for meditation/prayer as well</li>
    <li> First time ordering from WellnesScent. First time purchasing this type of Frankincense (Serrata). I prefer the scent of Boswellia Carteri that I have purchased from another company. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again, but if someone gave it to me, I&#x27;d be happy to take it.</li>
    <li> I have only been using essential oils for a few weeks now so I am still learning.  I do know after a very stressful day I put a few drops of frankincense oil with a few drops of lavender oil in my diffuser and I do seem to relax and sleep really well.  I also position the diffuser close to my bed and let the cool mist blow on my face.  It smells wonderful and hydrates my skin.  I wish I had started using oils years ago</li>
    <li> Came in perfect condition, was effective for my uses, and was delivered quickly. No problems!</li>
    <li> Great company to work with.  Very happy with customer service and quick delivery.  I ordered an oil that I was not crazy about the scent, it just did not smell like other brands, so I wrote them and they were so accommodating.  Ordered the peppermint oil instead, and love it!!  Works great on headaches so I always carry a bottle with me.  Recommend this company for those who like me love their oils!</li>
    <li> good value for the price</li>
    <li> Got this recently to correct some skin problems. Already have a mole so much smaller!  Love the aroma but it disappears quickly so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my usual scent.</li>
    <li> Recommend it to anyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this essential oil for it&#x27;s antifungal properties. I mix it with a carrier oil (jojoba); which should always be done. I&#x27;ve had good success using it.</li>
    <li> Quick Shipping, Smells amazing. I will order again! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Smell is not very strong compared to other essential oils Ive used. The price is good but I think it&#x27;s with spending more for a higher quality oil</li>
    <li> Everything arrived quickly and I love the scent!</li>
    <li> I like the oil and the price is right. It also smells great</li>
    <li> Great product and it arrived quickly. They also sent a free e-book that I can down load to learn more about it&#x27;s many uses. I am impressed with WellnessScent. They go the extra mile for their customers</li>
    <li> What a great brand, scent, oil, well all around product. It is not going to last long. It definitely gives you peace.</li>
    <li> great product, my SO loves it, will byagain</li>
    <li> Pungent and woodsy scent.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this oil.</li>
    <li> As I stated in my reviews of other Frankincense oils - they are all a bit different, but they all work. I liked the clean, fresh scent of this one, and am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> love love love this oil</li>
    <li> Superior product at a great price.  Also valuable information about the product once received.</li>
    <li> The oil came in today and I plan to use it to make some beard balm for my self, I will be looking for some lavender oil as well. the box arrived with a few other items and the box had been dented quite a bit but nothing was damaged. Thank you. Roger.</li>
    <li> great quality and shipped fast.  Looking forward to good results</li>
    <li> I just love the smell of this product! It&#x27;s Earthy and woodsy. The quality is amazing and it exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Top and excellent price! Can&#x27;t do without this one!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, awesome distributor.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this oil yet but it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Organic and smells wonderful.  This bottle was well packaged and required a signature for UPS to deliver.  I plan on using putting a few drops in my night time facial moisturizer and a few drop in the massage lotion for my feet every night.</li>
    <li> My order was delivered in a timely manner and I am well pleased with this Frankincense Essential Oil.</li>
    <li> this is a truly pure essential oil in a sea of Amazon fakes. I tested it with a drop test, along with other oils that claim to be pure, and this one evaporated without a stain within the hour, indicating that is is pure. Others left an oily residue, meaning they were cut with a carrier oil. I&#x27;ve been using this one in my anti-acne mix my skin looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I love organic frankincense oil and the shipping was smooth!</li>
    <li> Used daily it gets rid of moles!! But burns the skin if you use it right after a shower.  When applying it I would wait until the pores are closed.</li>
    <li> My favorite oil.  Smells fantastic.  Great for the skin. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Has really helped me with the swelling in my legs.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell Im glad I got it when it was on sale anyone who buys this at regular price consider spending 30.00 more and get it from another company this one is like applying olive oil it does nothing for you except leave you a lil oily. I read reviews before buying it and people said it works as great as other companies well I use young living and they&#x27;re not at all the same Im not promoting Young living go with a different brand doterra idk but don&#x27;t waste money on this one it does nothing.. The company it self is very nice though they sent several follow up emails to make sure I recived my oil and that they were pleased to have my business, maybe their other oils are good? But the frankincense oil isn&#x27;t any good, may be Im comparing it to my YL frank idk but i really think it does nothing. I wish it at least had a smell Id use it as a air freshener in my diffuser</li>
    <li> Thanks everything  was great!</li>
    <li> Incredibly fast shipping and product is high quality.  Highly recommend this company.</li>
    <li> excellent oil! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> excellent healing oil for surface skin problems.  Satisfied.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and customer service. Thank you! Will definitely do business with again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few weeks only, but  I really do like this Essential oil so much I am ordering more of it. I have a very serious Health condition and am applying it topically, and take that really expensive brand internally. I really do not know how well it will work since I have to use it for a few months to be able to report more. It smells as good as the more expensive brands, any way to me. Once I know more I hope to leave an update.  I have also bought some Now Frankincense oil, which brand I like and I usually have a lot of confidence in and it does have a weaker scent then this. It dissipates too quickly. Maybe it is because they are different types, this being Serrata and the Now oil being Carterri? I am no expert, so this is just my take on this.The Now oil is a much better price though. As an update after using this for about 6 weeks I have not noticed skin tags falling of as some other uses of Frankincense oil report. I have noticed a  dime-sized brown skin discoloration is now about 1/8 inch. This might be due to some other things I am doing such as the flax seed oil /cottage cheese mixture I have been faithfully eating every day.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service and shipping. I&#x27;d been recommended this oil for helping with a tumour and related pain. Too soon to say if it helps but it smells so good.</li>
    <li> It seems to relieve my depression symptoms. Although I am not completely certain that applying this is what relieves my symptoms as my symptoms aren&#x27;t severe, this is what apply on my body when I get the symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;I personally didn&#x27;t enjoy the way it smelled, but I usually apply it on the back of my neck so it doesn&#x27;t really matter and also it is diluted with almond oil.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil and will be purchasing on a regular basis!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and service</li>
    <li> I decided to try this brand of frankincense, since DoTerra&#x27;s is so expensive.  I liked that it is purportedly organic, and crafted from all over the world.  I happened to have a small sample from Doterra and was able to compare the scents of Wellscent&#x27;s and Doterra.  Each smells similar to the other, with Doterra seeming a little lighter.  Because frankincense is not a particularly pleasing fragrance, comparing the two brands confirmed that ths Wellscent product is presumably honest.  I will buy from thm again.  Great customer support as well!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for a few days now and so far I love it! The smell is strong but its a good smell! I put a few drops in my face lotion at night and it has been working great!</li>
    <li> Way to small for price</li>
    <li> Great product! Took my shoulder pain away!</li>
    <li> I very much like that it is certified organic</li>
