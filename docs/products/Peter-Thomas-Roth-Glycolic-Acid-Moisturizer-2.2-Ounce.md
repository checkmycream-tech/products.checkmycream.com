      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>Many of my clients really loved this moisturizer and this is one that I use for myself.</li>
      <li>The product itself feels nice on my skin, especially right out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>It has a great texture, and when I applied it to my face, it absorbed so nicely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Purchased this again, something told me I should give it one more try</li>
      <li>It is mostly fragrance-free, unlike the DDF.</li>
      <li>Love all of his products.</li>
      <li>LOVE it, repeat purchase</li>
      <li>It feels more like a moisturizer not like Noxzema that smells like medicine and burns on contact.</li>
      <li>Arrived on top.</li>
      <li>I wanted to give this more time</li>
      <li>May be better for those with oiler skin.</li>
      <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Although glycolic acid is great for acne, this product feels very oily on my skin.</li>
      <li>Most Glycolic acid with 10% or more</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>but it looks pretty good at the moment</li>
      <li>This product is especially wonderful for dry, aging skin.</li>
      <li>(Maybe this works better for wrinkle reductio and fine lines...</li>
      <li>This was my first time using any glycolic products and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful lotion for those with brown spots and those who want to look dead sexy.</li>
      <li>but the smell is too strong for me.</li>
      <li>I think there&#x27;s silicone in it because it has a somewhat smooth, primer-like consistency.  </li>
      <li>Very useful purchase.  </li>
      <li>once I received a fresh tube!</li>
      <li>Is it the original peter thomas roth?</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s wonderful to use as an exfoliant a few times a week!</li>
      <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it online because it is significantly cheaper!</li>
      <li>Its also great for wrinkles, acne and very dry, chapped skin.</li>
      <li>nothing really special about this item, but it&#x27;s not bad neither.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a Hugh change in my skin primarily around my eyes and smile.</li>
      <li>Plus, there is a little more product, which is always a good thing.</li>
      <li>Love this and alternate it with my retin-a to keep my face and decolletage smooth and sunspot free.</li>
      <li>:) skin is super soft!</li>
      <li>I am a fan of the entire line now, and looking forward to trying more products as my pocket book allows!</li>
      <li>Love the old one thou.</li>
      <li>and I used it right away.</li>
      <li>It is great if you wear makeup or tend to get blockages like small blackheads etc, you can feel the acid going to work to reveal smoother, hydrated skin.</li>
      <li>Once I stopped using so much hair product, the acne wasn&#x27;t going away on its own, so I needed to try something different.  </li>
      <li>Love this moisturizer, helps with acne, and moisturizes at same time.</li>
      <li>I like that it is an unbuffered glycolic acid with a moisturizer in one, and no weird scents.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This is more of treatment than an all-around daily moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It works really well as guys don&#x27;t like their skin feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; and my son is most please that it makes his skin tone clearer and properly moisturized.</li>
      <li>I bought this because of all the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>and it is a much superior product than the one I usually use.</li>
      <li>I have mild adult acne and after a couple of uses of this product I found an increase in breakouts.</li>
      <li>I experienced some dry patches and a little peeling at first, but that just meant it was working!</li>
      <li>I was really sad to see that DDF had restructured their product line, and didn&#x27;t continue with the glycolic moisturizer that I was using, but I have found this is an excellent replacement, and it works a little better for me.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product with my daily skin care, primary at night.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t work well to put on makeup over this after a whole day.  </li>
      <li>This works really well.</li>
      <li>Was bigger size before and different kind shape of tube.</li>
      <li>In fact, those said tiny bumps on my forehead had miraculously disappeared almost as soon as I started using the brush with my tried and true cleanser.  </li>
      <li>It moisturizes well any time you apply it, but there&#x27;s a slight burn if you use it right out of the shower (I enjoy it).  </li>
      <li>Within a couple more days, I had tiny red zits on my cheeks as well.  </li>
      <li>Really helped clear up my skin!</li>
      <li>I find that it is less harsh, and more refreshing than the DDF was.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received lots of comments on how fresh my face looks the next day.</li>
      <li>other two was fine.</li>
      <li>One thing I can say to younger women who have oily or combination skin is - when you get older, you will most likely have barely any wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to pick up a new one every 2-3 months.</li>
      <li>I have an oily t-zone that I&#x27;ve learned to live with, but my skin&#x27;s been improving ever since I started using an exfoliating brush as part of my routine.  </li>
      <li>, first I&#x27;ve ever used that actually did something.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product because I needed to try something new to clear up my skin.  </li>
      <li>I prefer a more silky feeling texture that is less likely to clog pores.</li>
      <li>My skin is soft, clear and shiny.  </li>
      <li>My face just glows, and it is as soft a a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was previously using a 15% AHA which was too strong to use on a daily basis, so this 10% is</li>
      <li>I noticed that some of my old acne scars had faded a little, but thanks to the new zits new ones have also formed.  </li>
      <li>Nothing negative, just same old non results as most moisturizers.</li>
      <li>Took the laugh wrinkle out of my nose by over half when I use it.  </li>
      <li>Does not feel greasy or leave skin red or sensitive .</li>
      <li>but it seems it might do the job in the near future!</li>
      <li>So while it can be a lifetime of frustration (trying to find something that gets rid of acne, but doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin), when you get older, there is that perk that comes along.</li>
      <li>After one month my skin is smooth, my breakouts are minimal, and my wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
      <li>Slight burn at first, especially if you&#x27;ve recently picked or scratched at something, other than that, fresh not overpowering scent, lightweight, not oily at all.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice anything one way or the other with this product.</li>
      <li>I use it every day or every other day because the glycolic acid can leave the new skin sensitive to sun.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product with my daily skin care, primary at night. This is the last thing I put on my face. I&#x27;ve noticed a Hugh change in my skin primarily around my eyes and smile.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the positive reviews. I&#x27;m 62, dark skinned and I have spots on my face. I have been using the product for a month now and I don&#x27;t notice any improvement. I will try the stronger version next, but I I am not satisfied with this Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great product but the smell is too strong for me. My husband even mentioned it.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream, I use 3-4 times a week, at night. I&#x27;ve received lots of comments on how fresh my face looks the next day. I like that it is an unbuffered glycolic acid with a moisturizer in one, and no weird scents. I tell all my mid-30&#x27;s girlfriends to get into using this as a daily night-time ritual.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I needed to try something new to clear up my skin.  I started getting cystic acne in my chin area, around the age of 23/24 when I started wearing my hair curly all the time.  My hair products (gel, curl creams, etc.) were probably getting all over my hands/face and in my pores.  Once I stopped using so much hair product, the acne wasn&#x27;t going away on its own, so I needed to try something different.  I have always used face wash with salicylic acid.  I can&#x27;t use benzoyl peroxide because it makes my skin red and itchy.  But salicylic acid just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  I decided my skin needed faster exfoliation/turnover to get rid of the current acne and keep it from coming back.  I started researching other acids since I knew my skin could handle salicylic... which led me to want to try glycolic and lactic acid.  I used REN products which were good, but they didn&#x27;t tell you the percent of the ingredients in the products.  I like PTR products because you know what you&#x27;re getting, and you know they use the max allowable over-the-counter percentage of the active ingredients.  I used this moisturizer (daily) in combination with the glycolic/salicylic acid acne clearing gel (1-2X per week), and I literally forgot how bad my skin used to be.  It&#x27;s not even on my mind or an issue anymore.  I still get a random pimple once in a while, but my new regimen has made a huge difference.  The product itself feels nice on my skin, especially right out of the shower.  It moisturizes well any time you apply it, but there&#x27;s a slight burn if you use it right out of the shower (I enjoy it).  There&#x27;s no noticeable smell.  I think there&#x27;s silicone in it because it has a somewhat smooth, primer-like consistency.  It works well under makeup.  However, if I use just this moisturizer in the morning and go all day without makeup, then have a date at night, I do like to re-wash and re-apply.  It just doesn&#x27;t work well to put on makeup over this after a whole day.  A little goes a long way, but my one complaint is that I wish the package was bigger.  I&#x27;d like an 8 ounce bottle so I don&#x27;t have to pick up a new one every 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> Great product. I will be ordering this again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the description explained that it shouldn&#x27;t be worn by people with sensitive skin but it makes my skin tingle,  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel overly moist after applying it but it looks pretty good at the moment so I think it&#x27;s doing something good!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Glycolic Acid moisturizer to me because of Milia. They look like very small white heads that you cant pop (sorry to those faint of heart). Glycolic acid works like a charm and I havent had a problem since using it. Its also great for wrinkles, acne and very dry, chapped skin. I have never tried this product until now and it is a much superior product than the one I usually use. It feels more like a moisturizer not like Noxzema that smells like medicine and burns on contact. There is a sting when you put it on but I noticed it wasnt as bad with this one. I would definitely buy it again and recommend to friends.TY</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it that long but it seems it might do the job in the near future!</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this product at Ulta. This was the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it online because it is significantly cheaper! It arrived promptly and I used it right away. The consistency of this product as well as the fragrance is different from the product I purchased at Ulta. It is not as thick and it smells like Jergen lotion. Very strange... I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this product thru this seller anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read many favorable reviews of this moisturizer on other sites and was hopeful that this is what I&#x27;ve been looking for to smooth out my uneven skin tone, minor acne scars, and those annoying tiny bumps I get on my forehead.  I have an oily t-zone that I&#x27;ve learned to live with, but my skin&#x27;s been improving ever since I started using an exfoliating brush as part of my routine.  In fact, those said tiny bumps on my forehead had miraculously disappeared almost as soon as I started using the brush with my tried and true cleanser.  But then I introduced PTR Glycolic Acid 10% moisturizer into my routine.  Literally the following morning after I applied the product, the bumps had returned  ALL OVER my forehead to my horror!  I read that some people experience skin purging, so I thought I must be one of those unfortunate people.  Within a couple more days, I had tiny red zits on my cheeks as well.  My skin started to feel even more oily than usual, and I knew this was not a good sign.  I tolerated the stinging and itchiness after each and every application, but I just didn&#x27;t want to go down this path any longer.  I noticed that some of my old acne scars had faded a little, but thanks to the new zits new ones have also formed.  I wanted to give this more time (I&#x27;ve used it for a little over two weeks) but I think I&#x27;ll go back to what was working for me before-- and that is to NOT use this product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful lotion for those with brown spots and those who want to look dead sexy. Love this! I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments on my face since using this</li>
    <li> I use this nightly with Peter Thomas Roth glycolic cleanser. This was my first time using any glycolic products and I am very pleased with the results. My skin had broken out pretty bad over the last year and there was no end in sight until I started this routine. I experienced some dry patches and a little peeling at first, but that just meant it was working! After one month my skin is smooth, my breakouts are minimal, and my wrinkles are less noticeable. I wish I had heard of glycolic products years ago!!</li>
    <li> I dont think I will ever buy another moisturiser again, for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin, especially through the t-zone. But after using this for a few days, I notices the difference in texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously using a 15% AHA which was too strong to use on a daily basis, so this 10% is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product, I haven&#x27;t had to blend moisturising into my foundation to stop it from drying out through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a week now, as a substitute for the DDF moisturizer. I really like it. It is mostly fragrance-free, unlike the DDF. It has a great texture, and when I applied it to my face, it absorbed so nicely. My face just glows, and it is as soft a a baby&#x27;s bottom. I was really sad to see that DDF had restructured their product line, and didn&#x27;t continue with the glycolic moisturizer that I was using, but I have found this is an excellent replacement, and it works a little better for me. I find that it is less harsh, and more refreshing than the DDF was. Plus, there is a little more product, which is always a good thing. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer, helps with acne, and moisturizes at same time. Slight burn at first, especially if you&#x27;ve recently picked or scratched at something, other than that, fresh not overpowering scent, lightweight, not oily at all. LOVE it, repeat purchase</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t heard of Peter Thomas Roth yet...Its about time you did.  The products have been around for quite some time. They are reasonability priced and get the job done.  Most Glycolic acid with 10% or more, you need a doctors perscription.  You can feel it working.</li>
    <li> I have used it for over a month and I don&#x27;t feel this product works for me.  Although it comes from Peter Thomas Roth, it&#x27;s not for everyone.  I have never seen any result whatsoever.  It&#x27;s a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> Peter Thomas Roth is a great skin care line, and is very effective in making a nice difference in your skin.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t feel like the Peter Thomas Roth from sephora for some reason. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin as well. Is it the original peter thomas roth?</li>
    <li> I thought that the glycolic acid would gradually &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; the skin on the areas of my face that I had applied it to.  It hasn&#x27;t so far, and the dark spots that are on my cheek, have not faded.</li>
    <li> Love this and alternate it with my retin-a to keep my face and decolletage smooth and sunspot free. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This can help clear up minor breakouts and clear dead skin cell layers. I use it every day or every other day because the glycolic acid can leave the new skin sensitive to sun. It is great if you wear makeup or tend to get blockages like small blackheads etc, you can feel the acid going to work to reveal smoother, hydrated skin. I would recommend getting a regular moisturizer with SPF to supplement, for the reasons stated above. This is more of treatment than an all-around daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Really helped clear up my skin! LOVE!</li>
    <li> Great product, I am seeing a deference!</li>
    <li> Does not feel greasy or leave skin red or sensitive . I also use their face wash... Went to beautipedia to research product before buying .</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 5 years. Love all of his products.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I have mild adult acne and after a couple of uses of this product I found an increase in breakouts. Although glycolic acid is great for acne, this product feels very oily on my skin. I would not recommend this product for those who are breakout prone like me. (Maybe this works better for wrinkle reductio and fine lines...I don&#x27;t know).</li>
    <li> I bought this with the glycolic wash, and they work great together.  I have \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin, and it has been looking dry, and well, mature.  So I thought I would try  something with Glycolic Acid in it and see if that made a difference.  And I have to say, after only 3 DAYS I see a difference.  My skin is soft, clear and shiny.  I just bought the Peter Thomas Un-wrinkle foundation as well.  I am a fan of the entire line now, and looking forward to trying more products as my pocket book allows!</li>
    <li> Tingly feeling,luv it</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m still looking somewhere in the age I am, and not twenty, I gave this four stars. :)  It is a great product though, first I&#x27;ve ever used that actually did something.  Took the laugh wrinkle out of my nose by over half when I use it.  Its been about a month now and have seen obvious improvement.  Would recommend to try.  I&#x27;m very happy and will continue to use this and the  Peter Roth Makeup.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice anything one way or the other with this product. It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel moisturized and I always felt as if I needed to put on another layer of moisterizer.</li>
    <li> nothing really special about this item, but it&#x27;s not bad neither. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any smell to it which is good cuz i prefer my moisturizer without perfume.</li>
    <li> Peter Thomas Roth - You cannot go wrong when you purchase any of hid products. Use them over and over. Prices on Amazon are awesome.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this works yet after three weeks, my skin is dry with fine pimples which was not there before the moisterizer, so I will give it another 2 weeks to see the results</li>
    <li> I am 34 year old African American woman who has had acne all her life. I&#x27;ve used a bajillion products over the years. This works really well. It is moisturizing and clearing. It&#x27;s also helped with oil control and improved the tone and clarity of my skin in addition to fighting my acne. I use it in the evenings after I&#x27;ve washed. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Meh. It definitely delivers on the AHA&#x27;s, but the texture of this cream is not great....a bit waxy. I prefer a more silky feeling texture that is less likely to clog pores. I will continue to use it sparingly under other preferred skin products a few times a week until it&#x27;s gone, but will not repurchase. May be better for those with oiler skin. I have Dry/Combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE****&lt;br /&gt;January, 2016&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Upgrading from 3 Stars to 5 stars***&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this again, something told me I should give it one more try and I&#x27;m glad I did! Totally different experience once I received a fresh tube! The texture was due to old stale outdated product....this is an excellent product when seller, ToysNGamesEtc in this case, ensures the product is not expired and safety seals are in place. Had I used the product before I would have realized it was not a problem with the product</li>
    <li> As an Aesthetician, I find this moisturizer a very top quality product. This product is especially wonderful for dry, aging skin. Many of my clients really loved this moisturizer and this is one that I use for myself.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son and he loves it.  It works really well as guys don&#x27;t like their skin feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; and my son is most please that it makes his skin tone clearer and properly moisturized.</li>
    <li> One of the three we purchased has a different cap on it and wife said it did not meet the expectation.&lt;br /&gt;the other two was fine.</li>
    <li> Arrived on top. This product is the best.</li>
    <li> Just o.k., probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Nothing negative, just same old non results as most moisturizers. Maybe it would work for you?</li>
    <li> improves and brightens complexion, evens my skin out, makes my pores look smaller. I feel that my skin is tighter. I&#x27;m on my second tube and I use it nightly. It never irritated or dried out my combination skin. I also use PTR 20% glycol pads every morning and I think they work synergistically.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it&#x27;s wonderful to use as an exfoliant a few times a week! Thank you Peter Thomas Roth!</li>
    <li> My skin is so bi-polar (oily and dry at the same time) that I had been using a multitude of other products on it, with not great results.  One thing I can say to younger women who have oily or combination skin is - when you get older, you will most likely have barely any wrinkles.  So while it can be a lifetime of frustration (trying to find something that gets rid of acne, but doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin), when you get older, there is that perk that comes along. Now I use all of the products in this line and my skin (though still not perfect) gives me much less problems (and looks a Lot better).</li>
    <li> I have used this produce for two months and I don&#x27;t see my improvement on my face. It does not change anything. I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great :) skin is super soft!</li>
    <li> Good product. I always change my moisturizer but after using this product  I was convince! Used it ever since. Was bigger size before and different kind shape of tube. Love the old one thou.</li>
    <li> The item was just as decribed and it arrived on time.  Very useful purchase.  The item is very expensive otherwise.</li>
