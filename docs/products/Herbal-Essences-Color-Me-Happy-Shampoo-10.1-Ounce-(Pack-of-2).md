      <li>Fantastic online prices and great for the subscribe and save option!</li>
      <li>Good for keeping your color bright, mine has never faded, but for someone with oily hair this just doesn&#x27;t do the job</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells so good, I wish they&#x27;d make a body</li>
      <li>It works well to help preserve my hair color and is a good compliment to the [[ASIN:B006L21PQY</li>

      <li>I love the smell of this shampoo!</li>
      <li>Love the smell!</li>
      <li>This shampoo is gentle and has a great scent too!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Preserves hair color nicely</li>
      <li>I think the best strategy for keeping highlights looking fresh is to use color-safe shampoos and conditioners which temporarily deposit color onto hair each time you use them and to keep your hair healthy by laying off the heat and salon-visits.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it lathers well, smells good, and leaves hair feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>Smells great and the price was right!</li>
      <li>This shampoo has a really strong scent!  </li>
      <li>I bought it on sale for very cheap but would not recommend it otherwise.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since read many accounts saying this caused flakes.</li>
      <li>It can be overwhelming at times.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>It was ok.........</li>
      <li>I must say that I do use the Color Me Happy Color Safe Conditioner too, which absolutely helps out in the softness department.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this shampoo unless I find something better.</li>
      <li>I am purchasing more of this shampoo and love that it is part of the subscribe and save program.</li>

      <li>I love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
      <li>However, I think the conditioner is okay.</li>
      <li>So anyway, I love this shampoo, and I also love Redken&#x27;s color extend which also has sulfate with alternative color-protection strategies (</li>
      <li>As much as I love this, it does clog my pores if I don&#x27;t wash off any residual shampoo with a bath soap.</li>
      <li>On top of that, the smell is too purfumey for my liking.</li>
      <li>but my mom and neice both love this one.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend that you go with the Happy Go Lather Body Wash by Herbal Essences as well.</li>

      <li>My hair fades very quickly with this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m strong shampoo over this one</li>
      <li>Scent is amazing, suds are clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>When I ourchased it here in 2012 the fragrance is fine but the shampoo didn&#x27;t lather</li>
      <li>While the fragrance of it can be overwhelming while washing your hair, I find it&#x27;s worth it to get the light lingering scent that stays in your hair the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to be back with Herbal Essence ColorMeHappy shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>clean-</li>
      <li>It works to clean your hair though, I guess.</li>
      <li>(the scent is very strong though, if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong smells</li>
      <li>Either be ready with a gas mask unless you enjoyed you Grandma&#x27;s roses drawer</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this shampoo and that it is color safe so my gray hairs stay covered longer then with just a regular shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I like the smell alot and have notcied how my color has not seemed to fade as quickly as before.</li>
      <li>and they say this is there new favorite shampoo.</li>

      <li>I also only blow-dry on warm.  </li>
      <li>this)&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair very clean and soft</li>
      <li>My hair color faded pretty quickly from a beautiful brown, to a dull and lifeless brown.</li>
      <li>though this was just the first time to try [[ASIN:B006L21OU6</li>
      <li>My hair does not hold on to red dye for more than a week, this product changed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but fit my budget... and the itching after washing my hair has completely stopped after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my favorite shampoo, and one of the only kinds that works well with my hair.</li>
      <li>Let me just say, this shampoo never, in the least, made me happy.</li>
      <li>Most likely because it was at a time when we were preparing to move</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping!  </li>

    <li> I absolutely love the smell. Great price. Great product. Will be getting more.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and cleans my hair well!</li>
    <li> Good smelling shampoo</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t color my hair but use this shampoo. It makes my hair feel so clean and smells great!!!</li>
    <li> Smells incredible, wish this scent was for more than the color safe. As much as I love this, it does clog my pores if I don&#x27;t wash off any residual shampoo with a bath soap.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo, and one of the only kinds that works well with my hair. I&#x27;ve tried a few of the other varieties of Herbal Essences but this is one of the only ones that doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily, like so many other brands do. Plus, i think the color me happy smells the best!</li>
    <li> Smells great and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I try to use color safe shampoos and need shampoos and conditioners that do not strip the color from my hair and does not strip my hair as it tends to be dry.  This shampoo is gentle and has a great scent too!  I am purchasing more of this shampoo and love that it is part of the subscribe and save program.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! It smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> Left a fresh clean feeling</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this shampoo and how smooth my hair feels when I use it.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair shiny and soft but takes the color right out.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo! I always use this one when dying my hair to have the color last longer!</li>
    <li> Great deal on this shampoo. I like the smell alot and have notcied how my color has not seemed to fade as quickly as before.</li>
    <li> Great deal.. doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair feel clean- almost leaves a build up... not sure if I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I like it but it is not my favorite. I have came to favor the herbal essence honey I&#x27;m strong shampoo over this one but my mom and neice both love this one. It&#x27;s smells very good and it lathers and goes on great. My mom and neice have long, thick hair and they say this is there new favorite shampoo. So all in all its a great shampoo</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years for my color-treated hair. I think it does a great job at a fraction of the price of salon products.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and felt it helped preserve my red dye extremely well. So I&#x27;d feel wrong giving too low of a review. However, this shampoo also dries out the scalp -- a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually believed that it was a psoriasis flare-up causing my head to itch so intensely after I washed my hair, and I just dealt with it for a long while. As in, this has been my shampoo of choice for years. When the store didn&#x27;t have this shampoo in stock, I bought something else that doesn&#x27;t preserve colour at all but fit my budget... and the itching after washing my hair has completely stopped after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never would have believed that a shampoo could cause dry scalp (my dandruff problem is much more manageable now that I&#x27;ve switched shampoos) or itchiness, but it would seem that&#x27;s exactly the case.</li>
    <li> Keeps your hair color lasting a little longer. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> Lathers very good, nice smell. No complaints</li>
    <li> Love products and price</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo and that it is color safe so my gray hairs stay covered longer then with just a regular shampoo.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this, will be reordering!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used anything else since I found it 5 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells so good, I wish they&#x27;d make a body spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they &amp;#34;don&#x27;t take suggestions from consumers&amp;#34; is what I was told when I e-mailed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silly buggers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They could make a LOT of money.</li>
    <li> I think this stuff really works. I was using other regular shampoo and I noticed my color would fade faster, but since using this my color stays longer. I thought it was just a coincidence, but I used the other shampoo (suave morrocan) and my color faded. The only thing I wish this shampoo had was a little oil or softener because it seems to dry out my hair. I must say that I do use the Color Me Happy Color Safe Conditioner too, which absolutely helps out in the softness department. I will continue to use this shampoo unless I find something better. But, for now I&#x27;m definitely happy with this.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair smells after my shower. This shampoo leaves my hair feeling shiny, clean and healthy. I get my hair colored every 3 months and I have noticed since I started using this shampoo, my color is lasting longer. Definitely give it two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> this product is poor.when shipped leaked all over the bag.do not buy this product.last time i will.better off buying it in the stores</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any benefits as far as this extended the life of my color treated hair. If anything, it makes it seem more faded and dry instead of sleek and shiny. It works to clean your hair though, I guess. Nothing that dollar store shampoo couldn&#x27;t accomplish though.</li>
    <li> great product for the colored hair.great product for the colored hair.great product for the colored hair.great product for the colored hair.</li>
    <li> Great deal!  Fast Shipping!  Good Product!  Love the smell!</li>
    <li> I was extremely displeased with this product, so I hopped onto Amazon to write a review to warn anyone who&#x27;s thinking of buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;  So, I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about two months now, since I dyed my hair, twice. I heavily dyed my virgin black hair to brown the first time, and a few weeks later, to a lighter brown. Let me just say, this shampoo never, in the least, made me happy. My hair color faded pretty quickly from a beautiful brown, to a dull and lifeless brown. In addition, I also noticed from the very first use that the product is EXTREMELY DRYING. I cannot stress this enough! But, I continued to use the product despite the fact that it makes my scalp extremely itchy. Why? Well, I thought if I just finished the product up, I&#x27;d be able to purchase a different product. This was definitely NOT a smart idea. I wash my hair about once to twice a week, since I have dry, colored hair. I didn&#x27;t expect the stuff to be THAT damaging to my hair, now, but I was definitely wrong. THIS SHAMPOO DRIED OUT MY SCALP SO BAD, IT MADE MY SCALP FLAKE!!!&lt;br /&gt;  I cannot explain to you how much I hate this product! My scalp itches, and now I suffer from dandruff! On top of that, the smell is too purfumey for my liking. I&#x27;ve read a few reviews elsewhere about the smell being &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;, but I just don&#x27;t get the hype. It smells awfully like roses and chemicals and some sort of rotten berry, to be honest. And I know I didn&#x27;t just get a bad batch or something, because I sniffed some others in the drugstore I went to, and they all had this displeasing smell.&lt;br /&gt;  To sum it all up, there is NOTHING I like about this product! I absolutely HATE this shampoo, and do not recommend it to anyone! However, I think the conditioner is okay.</li>
    <li> Love natural products.</li>
    <li> expensive but only type my daughter likes</li>
    <li> Great cheap shampoo, it smells decent too.</li>
    <li> I buy all kinds of expensive shampoos to try and I still go back to Herbal Essences Color Me Happy Color Safe Shampoo.  You can&#x27;t beat the price and I love how my hair feels.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the price and the recommendations of other reviewers. When I ourchased it here in 2012 the fragrance is fine but the shampoo didn&#x27;t lather and I find that disatisfying.</li>
    <li> My hair does not hold on to red dye for more than a week, this product changed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for close to a month and my hair has barely faded (this is an incredible feat for my hair)&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful (the scent is very strong though, if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong smells you may not want this)&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair very clean and soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using it, my hair gets dirty feeling/looking more quickly and I have to wash it daily to keep it looking decent</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo smells great and doesnt take color out</li>
    <li> Great product.  Definitely happy.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the price was right!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy to find a shampoo for color treated hair that has sulfate in it! Yes, there are countless beauty articles written by self-appointed experts that claim you shouldn&#x27;t have sulfate in your shampoo for dyed hair.  But I&#x27;ve found that sulfate-free shampoos are incapable of washing my hair.  They leave my hair flat and oily.   If you wash with luke-warm water versus hot and wash it no more than every-other-day, your hair color&#x27;s even more protected.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews saying their ends are dry.  I haven&#x27;t found this myself, but usually I dry my hair with a blow dryer on top and let the ends air-dry.  This may help them out??? So anyway, I love this shampoo, and I also love Redken&#x27;s color extend which also has sulfate with alternative color-protection strategies (although Redken doesn&#x27;t give me the same hair-body-on-top as Herbal Essences).  I dye my hair blonde, so I like to combine this shampoo with John Freida&#x27;s sheer blonde highlight-activating conditioner which leaves my hair completely bronze-free because it temporarily deposits a little color on the bottom each time.  Hair professionals claim you should go to the salon to get your hair dyed professional every 4 months and blow-dry your hair on the hot-setting daily.  If I did that, I wouldn&#x27;t have any hair left because it would all be fried away LOL I dye my hair myself and only go like once or twice a year to the salon so my hair isn&#x27;t completely damaged.  I also only blow-dry on warm.  I think the best strategy for keeping highlights looking fresh is to use color-safe shampoos and conditioners which temporarily deposit color onto hair each time you use them and to keep your hair healthy by laying off the heat and salon-visits.</li>
    <li> It was ok.........got this shampoo on sale, so,not too bad.  Left hair flat, but clean</li>
    <li> Good shampoo for the money.</li>
    <li> Used for years. After a while, noticed my scalp was getting really flaky. I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve not switched by now. I&#x27;ve since read many accounts saying this caused flakes. Otherwise, it lathers well, smells good, and leaves hair feeling very clean. Not amazing at color protecting, however. My hair fades very quickly with this. On to something that can get my scalp back to normal.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a really strong scent!  Either be ready with a gas mask unless you enjoyed you Grandma&#x27;s roses drawer sachet!&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Left everyone&#x27;s hair a complete mess. Hopefully I will remember to cancel my subscribe and save to this product.</li>
    <li> Affordable shampoo for colored hair with a pleasant scent. Buying a 2-pack was definitely a saving.</li>
    <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t lather enough. It also caused a little bit of dandruff on my hair. I bought it on sale for very cheap but would not recommend it otherwise.</li>
    <li> Since I have recently colored my hair with a product that actually looks natural afterwards and not a brassy or coppery look to it, I want to keep the color for as long as possible.  I looked online for a good inexpensive shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair.  There were several rave reviews for the Herbal Essence Color Me Happy collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased mine at the Dollar General Store and they happened to be on sale that day.  Already there&#x27;s a benefit.  I tried their product, and was instantly satisfied with how my hair felt soft, silky and appears shiny.  This is especially important, since I had just tried a shampoo product which I felt stripped away all the shine.  Besides that, it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this was just the first time to try [[ASIN:B006L21OU6 Herbal Essences Color Me Happy Hair Shampoo For Color-Treated Hair 10.1 Fl Oz (Pack of 2)]] and [[ASIN:B006L21OU6 Herbal Essences Color Me Happy Hair Shampoo For Color-Treated Hair 10.1 Fl Oz (Pack of 2)]] after this color treatment, I had used these same products years ago and was extremely satisfied with how much longer my hair color actually lasted.  So why did I stop using them?  Most likely because it was at a time when we were preparing to move and it just seemed like everything got put on hold, especially when you are trying to condense and know you can&#x27;t move everything.  I&#x27;m happy to be back with Herbal Essence ColorMeHappy shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Scent is amazing, suds are clean and fresh. No allergic negative reactions and we all have sensitive skin here. I use this in conjunction with the Dove Body Wash Sensitive Skin and after the shower it feels like I&#x27;ve been to an expensive spa for a luxury treatment. I highly recommend that you go with the Happy Go Lather Body Wash by Herbal Essences as well. Fantastic online prices and great for the subscribe and save option!</li>
    <li> Good for keeping your color bright, mine has never faded, but for someone with oily hair this just doesn&#x27;t do the job</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;Lathers extremely well&lt;br /&gt;Washes out easily and cleanly&lt;br /&gt;Preserves hair color nicely&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo fragrance makes your bathroom smell great&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance also ever so slightly stays in your hair, which often results in your significant other commenting on how great your hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not-so-good:&lt;br /&gt;To get the slight lingering scent in your hair, the shampoo itself has to have very strong fragrance. It can be overwhelming at times.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t give hair any shine or silkiness. Just solely preserves hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this shampoo. While the fragrance of it can be overwhelming while washing your hair, I find it&#x27;s worth it to get the light lingering scent that stays in your hair the rest of the day. It works well to help preserve my hair color and is a good compliment to the [[ASIN:B006L21PQY Herbal Essences Color Me Happy Hair Conditioner For Color-Treated Hair]]</li>
