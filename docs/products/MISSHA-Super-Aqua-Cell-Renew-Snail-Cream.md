      <li>I have very sensitive, rosy skin that&#x27;s also breakout-prone.</li>
      <li>I love this product because I feel like it gives back the moisture to my skin that is naturally lost, and it is not creamy and heavy-</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve been using alone for almosts 20 years) for sensitive skin that contains Shea Butter and the very essential SPF these Korean products lack.  </li>
      <li>so this was my first experiment with something a little higher-end.</li>
      <li>This tones down the redness, moisturizes without any grease or stickiness, and really helps rejuvenate skin also.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a little over a month on a daily basis as part of my morning routine in conjunction with vitamin C serum (which goes on first).  </li>

    <li> Had a really awful chemical smell - almost like gasoline! I was afraid to use it so it went right in the trash.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing.  It goes on sticky but once my face sucks it in, my face gets so soft.  I love this cream.</li>
    <li> Great product worked as advertise just have to let the skin get used to it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Within a few days I notice smoother skin and fewer lines around my eyes. I just placed a second order. Love this product.</li>
    <li> This cream absolutely works! It claims to be a wrinkle and redness reducer and it CERTAINLY does all that. I&#x27;m 48 y/o and had a lot of redness and the texture of my face was&#x27;t at all great. This cream improved all of that for me over time of course and it is worth the patience needed to apply it daily.. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! In fact this is the only line I use and friends have been asking me what I&#x27;m using... They can&#x27;t believe how much younger I look and neither can I!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all and it burn my face</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Seems to be doing a great job hydrating my face. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing cream- this works better than any department store expensive brands!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have told my friends and now they are all using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for 4 days. And I can feel the difference my skin feels more supple, bouncy &amp; I can see some of my wrinkles receding or their filling up my laugh lines &amp; under eye.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I&#x27;m usually a walgreens beauty product buyer so this was my first experiment with something a little higher-end.

    <li> Soft skin and easy to use</li>
    <li> This gel type cream is so moist!  I like it very much. Skin feels very soft after you put it on your face.</li>
    <li> This cream is very cooling, calming &amp; moisturizing without clogging your pores. My acne-prone skin has been doing great with this so far. A little bit goes a long way.

    <li> I waited a few months before writing this review because I really wanted to be accurate.

I find these products low maintenance and very effective- good for my sensitive and aging skin.  Economical for what it is and how far it goes!!!!  I truly recommend.</li>
    <li> Feels Soft, refreshing, moisturizing and smells great.  Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I really like it  lot.</li>
    <li> Goes on beautifully. Smells nice and really seems to hydrate.</li>
    <li> I only comment on products that I feel are worthy of it. This is worth it weight in gold for a skin aficionados like myself who has been using products for the past 32 years. This is sublime for it leaves your skin moist and refreshed with out the shine that some products leave. As the winter draws upon us it is the ideallic product for the weather.  This has now been added to my Christmas gift list to be passed on to treasured friends for it was a treasured friend that into diced me to it. I in tune have to pass this treasure along.</li>
    <li> For over-50 skin that tends to be dry, this is a great product.  I have been using it for a little over a month on a daily basis as part of my morning routine in conjunction with vitamin C serum (which goes on first).  My skin has definitely become more hydrated, feels firmer and looks smoother.</li>
    <li> I like the cream. After adding into my skincare regime, I have noticed improvements.</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle product, but it does what it says it will. I have very sensitive, rosy skin that&#x27;s also breakout-prone. This tones down the redness, moisturizes without any grease or stickiness, and really helps rejuvenate skin also. No breakouts since I&#x27;ve been using it (several weeks). I&#x27;ve tried several snail gel products and this is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This gel goes on super smooth (a tiny bit goes a long way). Over time, smoothes out your skin. Makeup goes on like silk. I&#x27;ve used this product for about three years and can say that my skin has definitely improved in it&#x27;s texture and appearance.</li>
    <li> This product is more gel than cream, but I love the consistency. I know the idea of putting snail mucin on your face is sort of gross, but this cream is awesome. It really moisturizes my face. I put it on at night and wake up with super soft and hydrated skin. I like the sort of citrusy smell and don&#x27;t find its fragrance too overwhelming. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> My mom loves how her skin feels!</li>
    <li> One word.....FABULOUS....my skin looks and feels great ;)</li>
    <li> Will buy it again.  Does what it says</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping with prime came as described thank you</li>
