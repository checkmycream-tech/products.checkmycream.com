      <li>but...i don&#x27;t think that this product is as good as its advertised to be...</li>

      <li>Again, if all you want is a great smelling lip gloss, this is the one for you but don&#x27;t expect a lot more.</li>

      <li>The glosses are packaged very cute.  </li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>I love anything that smells or tastes like desserts!  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
      <li>I find the colour sticks around (because Slip is very bright) but the glossiness disappears quickly although some of the scent will remain.</li>
      <li>However, the color and substance of the product are amazing.</li>
      <li>The color is indeed nice, but thats all I like about it...</li>
      <li>It wore nicely, wasn&#x27;t sticky at all and felt really nice on.</li>
      <li>I own the \\&quot;juicy\\&quot; gloss.  </li>
      <li>Both my guy friends and my boyfriend love it and always comment on how good I taste.</li>
      <li>I love wearing it as it feels good on my lips</li>
      <li>color is nice, but the taste is...questionable.</li>
      <li>This gloss has a plumping agent in it as well, which is nice.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think that i would buy this if it wasn&#x27;t because of jessica simpson.  </li>
      <li>so i thought it would be great, and because i wanted to see if the product really did taste great.  </li>
      <li>lips are full by nature), but it is a great product.  </li>
      <li>You can get great chocolate flavored lipglosses at discount stores that are much more comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sort of a Dessert junkie, and these glosses are by far the best of the line.</li>
      <li>Dessert&#x27;s lipglosses are delicious, they smell amazing, and they are the ultimate lip gloss.</li>
      <li>I gave this product 5 stars because it stays on long, looks great, smells great,</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>However, this is one of the most drying lip glosses I have ever worn in my life.  </li>
      <li>well all of the line is so cute.</li>
      <li>but the more and more you lick your lips</li>
      <li>I have Creamy, Slip, Slide and Taste, and I love them all.</li>
      <li>you will be pleased</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my lips any more plump looking.  </li>
      <li>My favorite is Creamy</li>
      <li>I find it&#x27;s more of a burning sensation on my lips than tingling</li>
      <li>so make sure you have another lip balm on hand.  </li>
      <li>I HOPE TO SEE MORE PRODUCTS SOON AT A LOWER PRICE.</li>
      <li>There are PLENTY of drug store brands that are better than this.</li>
      <li>The treats are marketed more towards teens and kids and tend to be cheaper.  </li>
      <li>but what isn&#x27;t so adorable is the price.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>Well I got the slide flavored one, I LOVE the taste</li>
      <li>THE PRICE WOULD BRING MORE BUYERS.</li>
      <li>I was able to purchase this on clearance through Sephora.com and I was quite pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, I love it!!-This is also a great gift to teen girls like me! ;-)</li>
      <li>nice thing is that the fragrance is so nice, that you can smell the whole time you have it one.  </li>
      <li>They also taste good to and smell really yummy</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thankfully I bought this gloss at the $10 price and not at full price!</li>
      <li>I have delicious, lucious, and one other that I can&#x27;t remember.</li>
      <li>When I got mine, I was so floored by the powerful and delicious scent that I showed it to my friends and every last one of them ran out to buy it too!</li>
      <li>I give this product a 4 star rating because it easily gets stuck in the hair</li>
      <li>I love the whole Dessert line, I own all the Lip Gloss, except for Dreamy and Slip.  </li>
      <li>(It does tingle), &amp; the colour isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
      <li>because I love it so much!!</li>
      <li>the taste and smell is absolutely fabulous, but you have to keep reapplying it.  </li>
      <li>So that&#x27;s fun.  :)</li>
      <li>Fantastic.  </li>
      <li>So I decided to buy the dreamy lipgloss on dessertbeauty.com and get the bunny lipgloss free of charge even though i was still paying $21 for the dreamy not to menchain a $10 shipping fee...</li>
      <li>The color has tons of glitter in it which i would have loved at 13,but at 17, i like to look mature, not with a ton of glitter all over my face.  </li>
      <li>over all, good product if you are willing to spend the money, except that it doesn&#x27;t plump much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I agree with the review below... the taste and smell is absolutely fabulous, but you have to keep reapplying it.  For a great plumping balm, I prefer &amp;quot;The Balm&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;DuWop&amp;quot; brands.  They may not taste quite as good as the Dessert line, but they are less expensive and last much longer.</li>
    <li> The scent is exactly as described, and the taste is about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the color to be very light, but it works perfectly over lipstick and will last a long time when applied in pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing is that the fragrance is so nice, that you can smell the whole time you have it one.  I have trouble not licking my lips constantly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it exactly as I expected based on the advertisements, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d find it the same!</li>
    <li> I love the lip gloss dreamy!! You can smell it the whole time it&#x27;s on and I have a hard time not constantly re-applying it, not beucase it wears off, but because I love it so much!! It is my new must-have lip gloss in my purse!! People notice the delicious smell when they are close by and it makes your breath smell really nice, too. I love the brozey-gold shimmer it left on my lips and the nice tingle it gave me. The only thing is, I wish it costs less(I recieved it as a gift)and was in a bigger size. It only lasts  about a month, though I always re-apply it!! I will definatly buy again!!!!:o)</li>
    <li> I bought this lip gloss, because the color looks nice in the tube, it was expensive so i thought it would be great, and because i wanted to see if the product really did taste great.  i was very dissappointed.  The color has tons of glitter in it which i would have loved at 13,but at 17, i like to look mature, not with a ton of glitter all over my face.  The color lasts for about 10 minutes and then your just left with the gross taste and faded glitter on your lips.  i guess it makes sense that the product is made for 13 year olds, because that is who it is really marketed to.  If you want to wear actual make-up that lasts, you&#x27;re better off with Addict by Dior for that price.</li>
    <li> I never thought i would give this gloss 5 stars!    Yesterday i was at Sephora and i saw the pillow talk sampler and underneath it a tag reading 13euros!I immediately bought it!    It was a real burgain,since the original price was 37euros(about $42,i think or more).    Mmmmm...These smell GREAT!    O.k,these don&#x27;t plump your lips but they will make them tingle.    All the colours are neat and glossy,with small glitter flakes in them that will bring your lips out,but they&#x27;re subtle so you can wear them everyday at school or at work.    The tubes are big,half the size of the original ones with metal caps.    My favorites are dreamy and luscious.    Give them a try,especially now that they only cost $10 each!</li>
    <li> For Christmas last year, I decided to try both the Dessert Treats and Dessert Beauty line because of the fact that you got a free lip gloss with your orders blah blah blah.  The treats are marketed more towards teens and kids and tend to be cheaper.  However, the treats (lipgloss) was not as good as the beauty.  So I decided to buy the dreamy lipgloss on dessertbeauty.com and get the bunny lipgloss free of charge even though i was still paying $21 for the dreamy not to menchain a $10 shipping fee...yikes.  Well i guess you could say i expected too much for the price.  I had read other reviews hearing about how the gloss didn&#x27;t really plump but smelled great.  I didn&#x27;t care much about the plumping factor, I just wanted a yummy lipgloss so that when you kiss someone on the lips, they won&#x27;t taste lipstick.  The glosses are packaged very cute.  They come in a slender tube and smell delicious.  They will tingle your lips after a minute or two but don&#x27;t really plump.  I find that the glosses seem to just absorb into my lips after like 5 minutes...maybe dry lips could be a factor?  But I do find them to be drying which might go away with the application of chapstick.  You have to reapply constantly just so that your lips don&#x27;t dry out.  But now since their selling for $10 a tube, why not try it out for yourself, there seem to be so many mixed opinions about this gloss on here.  My overall suggestion is to go with the beauty line if you want to try something made by jessica.  Pay the few extra bucks for the better quality.  I&#x27;m hearing now that the line is being discontinued which wouldn&#x27;t suprise me from everything made by Jessica Simpson going on sale and selling out with no comeback date.  I probably but the gloss again, for only $10 but just as a cute accessory.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I have the &amp;quot;juicy&amp;quot; flavored lipgloss. When it first arrived in the mail I was a little suprised at how bright the pink is, but it doesn&#x27;t look nearly as bright on your lips- it is a nice (sheer) pink. It really is pretty. It smells great and tastes nice too. I just wish it lasted longer and I think it is a bit expensive.  I might try one of the other flavors sometime, but I prefer the Clinique glosswear lip glosses. I think they are just as pretty, last longer and are about 1/2 the price.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this item at Sephora and I absolutly adore it!  I got Luscious which is a wonderful choice.  The scent of buttercream is beautiful, kind of like you are in a bakery.  The colors are very pretty.  They aren&#x27;t dark and nasty looking, but are light and shimmery.  I gave this product 5 stars because it stays on long, looks great, smells great, oh yes, and it tastes great!  Combinations of the Dessert cosmetics work very well. I also have the Juicy blushing cream, and together with the Luscious Lip gloss is a very sexy and tasty scent. This is a great product, I love it!!-This is also a great gift to teen girls like me! ;-)</li>
    <li> I bought this gloss in Bunny, because I was dying to try something from the Dessert line and I loved the color.  The color is indeed nice, but thats all I like about it... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I didn&#x27;t like: &lt;br /&gt;1. It was WAY over-priced (I think I paid $19)  &lt;br /&gt;2. It didn&#x27;t \\&quot;plump\\&quot; my lips whatsoever... thats totally false advertising &lt;br /&gt;3. It has a gross sticky texture &lt;br /&gt;4. It lasts for about two seconds &lt;br /&gt;5. It doesn&#x27;t even taste good... It tastes like nasty fake banana flavoring and sweet-n-low &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If it was less than $5 it might be worth it, but for now, save your money!!!</li>
    <li> I think that these products are wonderful.They also taste good to and smell really yummy it last so long like 6-7 hours I love it and it taste Yummy to. The packaging for Treats or well all of the line is so cute. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hope you enjoy dessert as much as I do!! &lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Jessica Simpson and Randi Schedeir</li>
    <li> I purchased the Pillow Talk sampler on QVC.  I was so excited to get it in the mail.  The packaging is so adorable and the tiny tubes are adorable for any girl but what isn&#x27;t so adorable is the price.  The flavors are yummy especially the rich caramelness of SLIDE.  The &#x27;plumping&#x27; ingredient does make your lips tingle just a little bit.  But the results aren&#x27;t noticeable.  Thankfully I do have decent size lips. [...]  My only compaint is that they are way too pricey.</li>
    <li> I bought luscious because of the beautiful pink color. I love wearing it as it feels good on my lips and it lasts. &lt;br /&gt;My only objection is that is marketed as a plumping product, which it really isn&#x27;t. The tingly sensation lasts few seconds and does not plump your lips. However, the color and substance of the product are amazing. I like to use it with a darker lip liner and matte type gloss, for shine and \\&quot;wet look\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4 Stars for the misleading Plumping idea</li>
    <li> I have BUNNY lipgloss, sheer frosted pink but goes on clear with lost of shine. It smells awesome and tastes just as good. Both my guy friends and my boyfriend love it and always comment on how good I taste. The smell is also very enticing and strong enough for people to notice when I put it on. It doesn&#x27;t do much for plumping (that I&#x27;ve noticed) but it is a great lipgloss -- especially for $10.00!! You&#x27;ll love it. On taste alone, I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Well I got the slide flavored one, I LOVE the taste but this product DOES NOT plump what so ever, it stung My lips but other then the sting no other reaction.  TOO high priced even tho it taste good, if it had actuall done its job to plump lips I would of bought again, but now I wont waste money on it!!</li>
    <li> I love the whole Dessert line, I own all the Lip Gloss, except for Dreamy and Slip.  They all look great and taste great.  The only thing I would change is that they are a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I just purchased the pillow talk set from sephora.  I like taste of juicy and luscious the best.  This is a good way to sample them if you don&#x27;t want just one flavor for $21.00!  You get six mini tubes that are 3.5 ml each (more than half the full size).  It is $42.00, which is still a little pricey.  The taste lasts a long time, but I find myself reapplying for the gloss and plumping pretty often.  The tingle is very mild, nothing like duwop lip venom, and I don&#x27;t really notice much plumping.  If that is what you are looking for, don&#x27;t buy these.  I like the fact that they aren&#x27;t sticky and thick (your hair doesn&#x27;t stick to your mouth), and nice colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So over all, good product if you are willing to spend the money, except that it doesn&#x27;t plump much.</li>
    <li> Jessica Simpson, once again, has out done herself. Not only is she a chart-topping recording artist, she is now a makeup creator. Dessert&#x27;s lipglosses are delicious, they smell amazing, and they are the ultimate lip gloss. Nonetheless, there are some downfalls. I give this product a 4 star rating because it easily gets stuck in the hair and it is a little bit expensive but is worth it. If money is not an issue for you, go ahead and buy it. You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I have a few of these lip glosses and of all of them I have to say that Slip is my favorite. When I got mine, I was so floored by the powerful and delicious scent that I showed it to my friends and every last one of them ran out to buy it too! I&#x27;m telling you, it&#x27;s amazing!! The colour is bright, but I use a very small amount on my lips because they are already naturally pink and very full so I don&#x27;t need to slather it on in an attempt to get the benefit of \\&quot;pluming\\&quot;, and from my experience it doesn&#x27;t plump your lips anyway but it WILL make them tingle with a minty sensation. The glosses aren&#x27;t sticky or heavy which is a must for glosses that I buy, but my one dislike is that they don&#x27;t last very long. I find the colour sticks around (because Slip is very bright) but the glossiness disappears quickly although some of the scent will remain. This was my first Dessert Beauty purchase, and from that I&#x27;ve bought many of the perfumes and products from the Dessert Treats line (Cupcake perfume is to die for and the lolipop flavor of products are yummy)! Some people complain about the price, but have you priced out other \\&quot;designer\\&quot; cosmetics lately? If you&#x27;re not willing to invest in yourself, who will? And if price really IS a big factor for you, try eBay, I&#x27;ve found tons of these full sized gloss lots for super cheap prices! Just a warning though, you&#x27;ll be hooked^_-</li>
    <li> I gave in to temptation and bought the duo (Bunny &amp; Dreamy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both smell &amp; taste delicious. BUT this gloss doesn&#x27;t make my lips appear noticely plumper (It does tingle), &amp; the colour isn&#x27;t that strong. But it is non-drying &amp; shimmery, with both colours suiting all skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All in all it&#x27;s a nice product which gives a light, more natural look, but they&#x27;re not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUNNY:  The scent of banana ice-cream. Looks pale pink in the tube, gives a clear, yet slightly shimmery result on lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DREAMY: Scent of chocolate &amp; coconut. Looks brown in tube, gives a shimmery bronze look to lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Lancôme &#x60;Juicy Tubes&#x27; are cheaper with bigger tubes &amp; stronger colours.</li>
    <li> I was tempted by the flavors of this lip gloss - I love anything that smells or tastes like desserts!  I especially love chocolately flavored or colored glosses, so I chose \\&quot;Dreamy.\\&quot;  I thought that at this price, this stuff was gonna be incredible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t.  Yes, it did smell good. It smelled wonderful. Fantastic.  Delicious. (That&#x27;s what the 2 stars are for - the smell).  However, this is one of the most drying lip glosses I have ever worn in my life.  I tried it alone and over various lipsticks, and it just dries out my lips.  I do notice a \\&quot;burning\\&quot; (NOT a tingling) when I first apply it.  It doesn&#x27;t make my lips any more plump looking.  It does make me want to reapply the product numerous times because of the dryness.  In fact, with just the initial application, I have to use more of this product than most lip glosses to actually make my lips appear shiny.  Even if it didn&#x27;t burn when applying it or dry my lips out, it&#x27;s just not worth the money.  You can get great chocolate flavored lipglosses at discount stores that are much more comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> I bought the pillow talk sampler since I did want to try them all without paying $21 a pop. My personal favorite is Slide (I&#x27;m a big caramel junkie) but I did like them all. For the price, however, it&#x27;s not THAT different from other similar glosses. It does tingle a bit and I did notice a slight plumping but nothing really significant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The texture is light and nonsticky at all which is appreciated. Yet, this makes it a little less durable than one would like it to be. Some more staying power would be nice since they come in such little and expensive tubes! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The flavor, which is the big perk of Dessert Beauty, is really good. Every flavor does smell and taste like what it claims to be. Creamy&#x27;s definitely a cake, Juicy smells like a popsicle, and the potent cherry smell of Slip is remarkable, among all the other flavors. No complaints at all there. Really good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because even though it&#x27;s a really good product, it&#x27;s way too pricey. Not that much (kissable, plumply delicous) bang for your buck...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sort of a Dessert junkie, and these glosses are by far the best of the line. I have Creamy, Slip, Slide and Taste, and I love them all. Beautiful colors, super yummy flavors, great for mixing and matching. What&#x27;s not to like? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Best color: Taste &lt;br /&gt;Best flavor: Slide</li>
    <li> I own the \\&quot;juicy\\&quot; gloss.  It is pretty, and goes on much lighter than it looks in the tube--a nice, sheer pink.  But no, it doesn&#x27;t last long, and I think it is a bit expensive for what you get.  It does taste sweet, though, and makes your lips tingly.  So that&#x27;s fun.  :)</li>
    <li> I was able to purchase this on clearance through Sephora.com and I was quite pleased with this product. I bought the color \\&quot;slip\\&quot;, which has a wonderful cherry scent to it. It is a bright pink color, very vibrant. It goes on vibrant too. The gloss has shimmer to it as well. This gloss has a plumping agent in it as well, which is nice. It gave a slight tingly feeling when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite impressed by this gloss. It wore nicely, wasn&#x27;t sticky at all and felt really nice on.</li>
    <li> If you want a great smelling and tasting lip gloss, try this line. My favorite is Creamy which is french vanilla and caramel and is nude in color. It is very shiny but it does not plump your lips like it&#x27;s suppose to. I find it&#x27;s more of a burning sensation on my lips than tingling and it only lasts for a few minutes when first applied. It is a little drying after an hour or two so make sure you have another lip balm on hand.  &lt;br /&gt;(or just keep reapplying) Again, if all you want is a great smelling lip gloss, this is the one for you but don&#x27;t expect a lot more.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Color is eh non existent to say the least. The shine is good. The lasting power is none, and the plumping I was skeptical from the get go - it doesn&#x27;t plump. It gives a weird tingly sensation that tastes slightly minty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I bought this gloss at the $10 price and not at full price! There are PLENTY of drug store brands that are better than this. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I JUST GOT MY KISSABLE LIP GLOSS IN THE MAIL AND I LOVE IT I REALLY DO THINK IT IS A LITTLE MUCH IN PRICE I THINK TO LOWER THE PRICE WOULD BRING MORE BUYERS. I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT YOUR DESSERT LINE. I HOPE TO SEE MORE PRODUCTS SOON AT A LOWER PRICE. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.&lt;br /&gt;STEFFANY</li>
    <li> Oh dear Jess what were you thinking? &lt;br /&gt;in short this gloss doesnt PLUMP your lips! &lt;br /&gt;NOR does it have a different colour for each gloss, i have 3 and i find them all to be the same! i have to apply tonnes of it which ends up looking like i have a coat of thick gooey stuff on my lips and it sticks in your hair, the colour is poor, one thing is the scent is nice for the 1st 2 uses then it goes bad and it tastes SICK!  &lt;br /&gt;i wish i could get my $60 back! &lt;br /&gt;please try something else, ie MAC Prrr.  you will be pleased and it&#x27;s cheaper!</li>
    <li> I received a tube of lucious for my birthday...and i have to say that i thought it was cool that i had a part of jessica simpson&#x27;s line of beauty products, but i almost had a heart attack when i found out how much it cost.  I love lipglosses, and i bought M.A.C lipglass in Prrr which i though was really expensive, but it was only like $18.50.  I have to admit the smell of lucious is sooo good, as soon as i smelt it i thought of candy.  I think that this lipgloss is a little sticky, but i don&#x27;t think that there is a lipgloss that isn&#x27;t, no matter how much you&#x27;d like to believe it.  I gave this item 2 out of five stars because it smells good and its by jessica simpson.  Those are the only good things about it.  There are bad things about it, like the taste, the cost. I have put this lipgloss on, right this second as I&#x27;m typing to give you a step by step recollection of my thoughts...first of all...i just licked it....and it tastes horrible.  It&#x27;s like a mixture of bad chemical candy, and ughh i don&#x27;t know...i can&#x27;t stand it...hold on a moment while i take it off...eww...okai...srry but i&#x27;m not a big fan of the taste...but anyways, i hate to say it but...i don&#x27;t think that this product is as good as its advertised to be...i don&#x27;t think that it should cost this much, it cost about $40.00 and i just don&#x27;t think its worth it.  I honestly don&#x27;t think that i would buy this if it wasn&#x27;t because of jessica simpson.  If you have some money to spare, go ahead and buy it, but other than that, i&#x27;ll stick to my smackers watermelon lipgoss thank-you.</li>
    <li> I got this lip gloss from my friend who is a Jessica Simpson addict and I figured, because of its OUTRAGEOUS cost, it would have be atleast half-way decent. The first time i tasted it, i thought it was alright but the more and more you lick your lips, the more you realize: It&#x27;s not that different from other lip glosses.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The color is nice, but the taste is...questionable. The appeal of this product is that it is \\&quot;deliciously kissable\\&quot; but the fact is, it&#x27;s not. LIP GLOSS is mainly used to appeal to others; to accentuate the lips. This lip gloss tastes GROSS, and synethetic; not the least \\&quot;delicious\\&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t have the natural taste and its a disappointment.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If the \\&quot;taste\\&quot; is what appeals you to buy it, DONT. &lt;br /&gt;It the fact that its Jessica Simpson&#x27;s product appeals you to buy it, DONT. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the best flavor there is. There are other lipglosses - actual LIP GLOSSES - that taste and smell alright for this cost that are WAAAAY better.  &lt;br /&gt;Victoria&#x27;s Secrets, Estee Lauder, etc. etc.  &lt;br /&gt;The label says that it is \\&quot;kissable\\&quot; and \\&quot;edible\\&quot; but I say to you, its not very different from other lip glosses for its outrageous price. Its not that great of a lipgloss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They are just using Jessica Simpson to sell the product, not by the actual quality this lip gloss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I give it a one.  &lt;br /&gt;Instead of buying this product, buy something that is an actual lipgloss.</li>
    <li> OMG  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I loooooove this lip gloss!!!!!!!!!!!! It smells good, tastes incredible and is perfect for people who want shiny lips. It doesn&#x27;t plump, but it does give it a great shine! I have delicious, lucious, and one other that I can&#x27;t remember. I love these lip glosses!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I will never use another lip gloss other than this one!  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make my lips look fuller(my lips are full by nature), but it is a great product.  It&#x27;s sheer and nice.  The colors are soft and sheen.  Not sticky or gooey.  I love it!  Creamy, Sunny, and Taste (Delicious) are the best.</li>
