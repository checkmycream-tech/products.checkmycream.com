<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good product I love the fact that it is so light weight and makes my foundation look great! Definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> was cosplaying outside and it sprinkled almost the whole time i was out there at the fall festival i went to. used this before i put on my body paint and it stayed on all day. my clothes were soaked my wig was damp but my makeup was spot on and flawless the whole time even though i was there for a couple hours with no umbrella. i swear by this stuff.</li>
    <li> This quickly sets my Mehron tattoo cover makeup so it won&#x27;t rub off on my clothes. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. My face becomes chalky as if i m putting talcum powder. Feels like ordinary baby powder. Could not return as free return was not there.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be a lot bigger but definitely a bang for your buck works amazingly</li>
    <li> Worked well for my Halloween make up - lasted all day.  Kept my make up on and kept it from smudging.</li>
    <li> Best translucent powder I have ever used. I used to use Bare Minerals translucent powder, and this even exceeds that. I use this with Mehron Celebre foundation. Gives you a beautiful matte finish that lasts all day. Good to set lipstick with too.</li>
    <li> I received this product on 5-1-15 and used it on 5-4-15 I love it!!! My makeup has been flawless allday a must buy product!!!!</li>
    <li> this is extremely sheer and helps set makeup extremely well.</li>
    <li> it itches to put on my shin. it is very uncomfortable as well</li>
    <li> I even used it to set my lipstick! Lips felt super dry but it worked like a charm! I never needed to reapply! I&#x27;ve even worn it working out, it works like a champ cancelling out all perspiration on my face!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It does what it says!</li>
    <li> I love Mehron. I love it. LOVE IT. Doesn&#x27;t change the color or texture of your makeup, helps to set it quickly, and its loose so you can apply with a kabuki brush (I&#x27;d absolutely reccomend this) or puff as you prefer. I used this first for a production of &amp;#34;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&amp;#34;, and it covered a variety of vibrant colors as well as shimmer and sparkle, and it didn&#x27;t dull any of the color or sheen while it helped to keep my actors&#x27; faces from melting off while they bounced around the stage.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this powder, i use it for regular makeup application. I tend to be a heavy sweater in the warmer months and these really helps to keep my make up flawless a bit longer without a huge white cast</li>
    <li> The best setting powder I&#x27;ve ever used..leaves your face perfectly matte. Gonna buy more.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff... helps my eyeshadow set great and I cannot wait to use it with my Geisha photo shoot in the future!</li>
    <li> Works about as well as any normal face powder would. Not really worth the price in my opinion. and it smells awful!</li>
    <li> This was our first time using something like this and from what I could tell, it worked well.  I had to use more than I expected but it did work well.</li>
    <li> This product is good, its my first time using it and it works good. The container is a little small.</li>
    <li> love. i use it underneath my eyes to set my councilor and on my nose and t zone to avoid shine. I am a woman of color (NW40/ NW45) and it brightens but doesn&#x27;t ash out or look white. Used in my head shots, perfect powder.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> This instantly mattes my face out and takes the shine from my forehead and nose away when I apply this. I only apply 1 time per day. I notice that my skin is alot less shiny and oily thorughout the day. Even though I have darker asian skin, this powder doesn&#x27;t leave a white tint on my face because the powder is so fine. Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> I use this daily!!!!!! Simply amazing product, a little goes a long way! I used this during theater and live dance performances and it last for hours. If you don&#x27;t want your face to be oily and cant a perfect powder this is it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff</li>
    <li> Used this for my beach wedding in mexico! It contains antiperspirant so i felt it would definitely come in handy. It worked wonders! I had all my girls use some to set their makeup and it stayed in place throughout the 90+ degree heat and dancing all night. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. It works very well and I can recommend it to be used in a beauty salon. Very good product.</li>
    <li> It works really well and is translucent so it doesn&#x27;t show over the top of the makeup. It didn&#x27;t make the makeup gummy or feel sticky.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect setting powder. i am not going to lie i was worried about it when i first saw it because it is white. when i saw white i mean paper white white. when i put it on it goes on the skin flawlessly and it is really the most translucent powder ever. normally powders of any kind give me an ashy look. this makes me look natural and flawless. i have medium olive skin according to Mehron. the container is small but i can see it lasting me a year a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> A bit messy to apply.</li>
    <li> Very versatile and blends easily. Great price. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love using this over my foundation it makes my skin so soft and helps with my oily skin</li>
    <li> It is kind of hard to see, but it has an anti-perspirant in the powder which is great for all day wear - it helps to reduce my end of day shine. I have very pale skin though so it is compatible with my tone - if I were any darker, might look like a vampire make up job.</li>
    <li> It works as expected. Sweating  lots will cause it to wear out faster. I think oily skin will work against it also.</li>
    <li> I am a huge makeup junkie and have tried many translucent powders. It arrived pretty quickly for me. I&#x27;ve always liked translucent powders because of the sheer coverage. I thought this one might even be too opaque, but it blends nicely and even helped minimize the appearance of my pores. With one application using a flat top kabuki brush my face was absolutely matte for hours even in 80 degree fahrenheit weather with NO TOUCH UPS! If you&#x27;re considering purchasing this as part of your makeup routine or for costume makeup I highly recommend. Will definitely purchase again, however It would be nice to have a compact setting powder a well!</li>
    <li> I was Sith Pureblood for Halloween. For those who don&#x27;t know, that means I had wax ridges, dark red skin, and lots and lots of grease paint and oil. This setting powder did not substantially change the color of the makeup I used, though it did of course take the shine off. I was actually really quite impressed by how -well- the make up was set. I wore the make up all day, and no few children and adults wanted to touch my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started getting smudges at around the 10 hour mark, when I just went and reapplied. I had very little rub off of the makeup on my clothing, and miracles of miracles, my lipstick stayed in place all day. I&#x27;ll be using this again. :D</li>
    <li> Now, this product totally makes my makeup waterproof...but I actually have dark skin, so when I put too much of the powder on my makeup it kind of lightens it!</li>
    <li> It work fine for my needs at this time. Haven&#x27;t really used it like I intended yet . Will really work on it this coming week, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist and I don&#x27;t do or apply theatrical makeup (I mention that since the Mehron brand tends to be for those uses) BUT this stuff is amazing for everyday makeup, too! I apply my foundation and under eye brightener as usual then finish the rest of my makeup. I use this powder under the eyes in the area where most setting powders fall short. Many setting powders I&#x27;ve used have settled into the fine lines below my eyes or it becomes &#x27;cakey&#x27; which is definitely not a good look for anyone. Somedays I use this just for the under eye area, but it works just as well as an all over setting powder, too! The jar is small but don&#x27;t let that worry you, you use so little that it will last a very long time. This was a lucky find on Amazon and I&#x27;m glad to have stumbled across it! Its definitely a 5+ star beauty product ✮✮✮✮✮</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I used it mostly on my lips after applying lipstick, to get it to last throughout the day. It absolutley works, wether it&#x27;s on my face or my lips, gives me that matte finish and doesn&#x27;t cause breakeouts. Awesome!</li>
    <li> Love love LOVE this! Great for contouring</li>
    <li> I like this powder a lot. It&#x27;s great for setting your stage make up and you only need a small amount.</li>
    <li> This is a great setting powder - used this on my sons face (he was a clown)..even after many hours and drizzling rain, his face looked as good as new!</li>
    <li> Love the anti-persistent in this. it stops you from getting oily and wet looking.</li>
    <li> The product did as promised. It held up the make up job I did quite well!  I thought this worked great to keep Halloween makeup from running.</li>
    <li> Good, not great.  Maybe I wasn&#x27;t very generous with the application but this product did an OK job at setting my makeup and preventing sweating.  It works well enough for what it is, and it&#x27;s always good to have. Not for every day wear, maybe for a night out on the town or a party.</li>
    <li> I really like this setting powder, of course white powder is always intimidating but it really leaves no cast of white. It sets my foundation/contour beautifully. I sometimes have to re apply it during the day, but I have oily skin and live in Texas( I am constantly sweating). But it really holds up great and is a happy addition to my make up routine!</li>
    <li> Great for setting face paintings. Bought this for my daughter and she is looking forward to using it when she needs the makeup to last for hours. Also bought brushes and Mehron face paint.</li>
    <li> It contains talc, which I didn&#x27;t know before the purchase. I thought I was buying a product that was made by the same company that makes Cinema Secrets powder, but I was wrong. Disappointing as talc tends to clog my pores - no repeat purchase.</li>
    <li> Not too sure about this setting powder. Will have to try it again. The first time, it left me looking like my face was painted white, in the hot Florida weather.</li>
    <li> great product, will buy again</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in a timely fashion and was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this! Let&#x27;s see how it works in hot weather.</li>
    <li> Used it 3 or 4 times during halloween and barely made a dent in it! Little bit goes a loooong way!</li>
    <li> Love it...it set make up really well and it dies what it says..</li>
    <li> This powder does well at matting liquid and cake foundation, and although it&#x27;s white in color, it goes on translucent, but I haven&#x27;t been able to tell the difference in my facial perspiration at all while wearing it. It does, however, react better to sweat than regular pressed powder, in that it doesn&#x27;t leave weird streaks where the sweat evaporated.</li>
    <li> This powder is awesome! I use this to set my &amp;#34;highlight&amp;#34; and nose! I have a very oily nose but when using this powder, it isn&#x27;t oily at the end of the day!</li>
    <li> I bought this powder to set my normal foundation for special occasions when I need to control perspiration on my face. This product exceeded my expectations. I use a velour puff to apply this translucent powder all over then apply the rest of my make up. This powder holds longer than any brand of foundation setting powder I have ever purchased. One note this powder does contain aluminum so it can&#x27;t be used everyday but when you need your face to look your best for something special its my go to powder. I highly recommend this product not just for grease make up but for beauty make up as well!!! Amazing!</li>
    <li> I have tried and  tried to find a setting powder that goes on easily, isn&#x27;t chalky, lasts all day and helps control shine.  I&#x27;ve bought everything I can think of, including the much talked about Makeup Forever hi-def. Most everything I&#x27;ve tried are all quite expensive and good, but there always tends to be one or two things I don&#x27;t love about it.  I&#x27;ve stuck with the Makeup Forever for a couple of years, as I need a good setting powder especially when I&#x27;m modeling.  It&#x27;s worked fine, but I do need to touch up halfway through a photo shoot.  I came across the Mehron ultrafine setting powder, read the reviews, was a bit skeptical because the price is so low, but I loved that it also has an element that helps control sweat! There are more times I can think of that I&#x27;ve been shooting outside in the summer heat, or in a very hot studio under the lights and I start to perspire a bit on my face.  As soon as I got it, I tried it on my face to see the texture, if it was truly translucent and met the other reviews I&#x27;d read about it.  I immediately loved it, and use it every day I wear makeup, even on days where I just wear a BB cream to set it .  My makeup stays all day, doesn&#x27;t budge even with a really creamy foundation or BB cream, and once tested on a photo shoot, I was HOOKED! Not only did it perfectly set my makeup, it really is translucent..it will not lighten the color of foundation, I didn&#x27;t need a single touch up, and under the hot studio lights I stayed nice and shine free.  If you&#x27;re even on the fence about buying this, just do it.  You will not be disappointed! I&#x27;ve also got many of my makeup artist friends to switch from everything they&#x27;ve ever used.  This is a MUST have in your beauty routine!</li>
    <li> this is Really good powder. It sets my every day makeup like a charm. Even when i sweat on hot days, it wont run. really good and a good price!!</li>
    <li> It was super small but you actually didn&#x27;t need too much of it I love the top part so all the powder won&#x27;t spill out and it did the job! It is a white powder though so it will make the make up paler where actually worked for my homestuck cosplay will buy more when I run out :)</li>
    <li> Makeup still came off on clothes. I didn&#x27;t look sweaty but did not seal makeup.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! i am a freelance MUA and my friends and i decided to go out for my birthday. i did everyones makeup (6 people including myself) and used this setting powder. we went to a club and we all sweat it up dancing! everything was a hot sweaty mess EXCEPT our faces! this powder is a miracle worker! i will be using it for every bride i do makeup for from now on!</li>
    <li> ...enough said.  Shot for ten hours, and only had to touch it up once.  Minimal product required to set Kryolan products.  Wasn&#x27;t ashy on my Afr-Amer skin.  (think Regina King&#x27;s shade)</li>
    <li> this packaging can make a bit of a mess. the shine did break through after a short time. not a bad product but not all that either</li>
    <li> very fast ship; worked perfectly with my holloween make up, added to the over all effect of the make up</li>
    <li> This stuff was great for hours with Halloween makeup.</li>
    <li> i am veryyyy oily as well and this helps a great deal!</li>
    <li> Nice and light! It is pure white but disappears. Nice and smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;Helps to keep the shine down with the antiperspirant which is probably just the talc.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it came in a compact!!</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was. Bit hesitant on this product when I placed the order but I absolutely love this stuff. It keeps my extremely oily face shine free for hours. I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even color a super old tattoo. The colors are exactly as shown, so if there is any warmth, or red tones to your skin, this won&#x27;t even blend. I used it with the M505T Tattoo Cover and barrier spray, and after numerous tries, couldn&#x27;t even get it close to matching my skin, or covering. There is a video on youtube to watch how to cover a tattoo, and I followed the directions as closely as I could and was left with a blob of makeup on my arm that was obviously just masking a tattoo. It rubbed off on my white shirt (and I would be very disappointed if it rubbed off on my white wedding gown), only lasted about an hour, and then splintered and cracked to leave my arm looking like a desert floor. Of course, this is just my experience, but it wasn&#x27;t a good one. Thank goodness for Amazon and their return policy!</li>
    <li> Best setting powder I have tried thus far. I used it with a very cheap countour pallete and this setting powder made the make up look flawless and expensive. Works wonders on oily faces :)</li>
    <li> The color i recieved was white. It didn&#x27;t make me look white, just a TAD bit more pale. It does go away over time. Its my go to setting powder now. i really notice the difference in how long my face stays matte for. I like that it doesn&#x27;t enhance my blush or foundation color. some setting powders change the appearance or shade of my colors. Great for the price. I use a kabuki brush to put it on by pouring some onto the cap &amp; then using a stripple type motion apply to my face.</li>
    <li> Arrived in less than 3 days. However the product does not blend well. You can see the white powder caked on top of my make up.</li>
    <li> I use this for my makeup powder, and it works better than my NARS setting powder. It lasts for hours, and my makeup looks flawless. I would suggest this only for people with oily skin, though.</li>
    <li> This is very similar to my Ben Nye Neutral Set powder, but I like that it keeps my foundation firmly in place without looking too matte.  I apply by pressing it into my face with a brush, then dusting off the excess, and it really extends the longevity of my liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> This will certainly work well, thanks!</li>
    <li> I use this as my everyday powder to set my liquid foundation. It doesn&#x27;t change the color at all and leaves a perfect matte finish. It also seems to keep oil at bay longer than regular powders.</li>
    <li> Im an oil skin kinda gal but i have noticed when i use this power it extends the time before i have to worry about shining under the light :)</li>
    <li> Great powder for covering prosthetics. I am going to try their paint kits next.</li>
    <li> Item as described, fast shipping, very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this powder! Even on dark skin tone is very blend able! Keeps you matte!</li>
    <li> excellent product, brushes ino base well, recc of ciotume professional worked very we&#x27;ll for two weeks of a shakespeare production.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work too well for me. I walk to work though so I tend to sweat a little more. Maybe I should use more?</li>
    <li> Great powder for setting costume makeup, easy to apply, goes on clear and reduces smudging.</li>
    <li> Works great with the clown white cream makeup.</li>
    <li> Wonderful powder. Can be used on darker complexions and will not leave you looking ashy. also affordable alternative to other powders.</li>
    <li> used it at Halloween time....love it</li>
