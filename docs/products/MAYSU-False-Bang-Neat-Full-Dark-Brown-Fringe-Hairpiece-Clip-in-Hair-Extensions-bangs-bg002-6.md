      <li>Very cute for change up.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still very convincing unless you&#x27;re up close.  </li>
      <li>Kind of wish they had the combs all the way across the piece even though one will hold it well.</li>
      <li>so if you order it order a shade or two darker than your own hair, but remember there is a difinate line where it clips on</li>
      <li>This is so  nice.</li>
      <li>Liked this hair piece.  </li>
      <li>The band that connects all the hairs were nicely put together.  </li>

      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>I just wished it matched my hair color a bit better.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product with a very affordable price.</li>
      <li>so I gave it an OK</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I bought as a &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; piece, i would have returned for refund, but shipping was more than the cost of item</li>
      <li>so they&#x27;re more fringed or wispy.  </li>
      <li>Love it, love how it lays, love how it&#x27;s styled.  </li>
      <li>, it makes them look much better.</li>
      <li>Super cute to play with!</li>
      <li>since its so perfect you need the rest of you to look the part as well otherwise you will look like a weave wearer not a natural looking bang</li>
      <li>This product is best when you have bobby pins to secure it, as the included clips do not work that well for wearing it as actual bangs.  </li>
      <li>Great coverage and natural looking.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and stays put.</li>
      <li>And it easily clips in to your hair...</li>
      <li>Easy to put in.  </li>
      <li>Quick ship though and color seemed pretty good.</li>
      <li>My daughter loves it and it&#x27;s the exact colour of her own hair.</li>
      <li>The original color I ordered was too light, but I contacted the seller and they were so nice to send another one in the right color...</li>
      <li>A great piece for a low price.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so excited I get to show them off.</li>
      <li>Ok, the first thing to keep in mind here is: You&#x27;re paying $6.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased when I received and tried on the false bangs; they look very convincing!  </li>
      <li>I have curly hair, but I think it still looks cool.</li>
      <li>After moving them forward and trimming they look much more real, though.</li>
      <li>These are cool to use to change up your look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and the color is pretty.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for daily use the more you care for it the better</li>
      <li>It was a lot of fun to play around with it.</li>
      <li>Although it is not the right color for me.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t look very real, but they are fun to use.</li>
      <li>IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT USUALLY IS ...  M Roberts</li>
      <li>But looks very real.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t going to be a super high quality, wearable right out of the box hair piece.</li>
      <li>My daughter absolutely LOVES this item!</li>
      <li>It looks exactly as in the picture.</li>
      <li>the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; started to fall out the first day.</li>
      <li>She wore it to school for the first time today...</li>
      <li>The only way I will be able to where them is if I cut them</li>
      <li>The dark brown is really more medium to light brown.</li>
      <li>You should be aware of this before purchasing, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Was ready to use right out of the envelope.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not detracting a star for this because I actually think its better to have them a bit long then trimmed to fit your face</li>
      <li>so I really just wanted it to get an idea of what I would look lie with bangs before I take the plunge.</li>
      <li>And buy some shine spray for your hair the piece very shiney.</li>
      <li>The color is very specific and too light for my hair.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t stay in place very well.</li>
      <li>it looks like real hair</li>
      <li>Also the price really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>But then again for the price can&#x27;t really say much .Only</li>
      <li>that really made me happy!&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really imagine wearing them with your hair up, though.</li>
      <li>But on the other hand, for $6, this is MUCH better quality than what you would expect.</li>
      <li>but I dusted them with some dry shampoo, and it now looks a lot more natural.</li>
      <li>Very soft, shiny and looks real.</li>
      <li>The hair is very soft, feels real, and falls well.</li>
      <li>These are as described, but are hard to wear on there own.</li>
      <li>The hair feels soft and real...</li>
      <li>only gave 4 stars because no the right color.</li>
      <li>Color was not dark brown - much lighter.</li>
      <li>I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t match my hair color well enough, and although they don&#x27;t match it EXACTLY</li>
      <li>I ordered dark brown and was medium to light brown.</li>
      <li>The length makes it hard to pin and look believable.</li>
      <li>Just too much bang, too long and too high on the head--also</li>
      <li>It looks so natural.</li>
      <li>I gave them to my 3 year old to play dress up with.</li>
      <li>It does look shiny, so it doesn&#x27;t look as natural as I would like it to.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t blend with natural hair...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think they could look natural that way.</li>
      <li>Good fake hair, but the color was completely off.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good fake hair, but the color was completely off. It just hard to know the true color through a picture online.</li>
    <li> I like it.  The quality was alright.  The band that connects all the hairs were nicely put together.  Much nicer quality than the other fringe I got.  I just wished it matched my hair color a bit better.  I also didn&#x27;t want to return because it would have cost almost double to return the product.  So instead I just kept it maybe I might color my hair one day and this could work.</li>
    <li> It definitely looks like fake hair  and the color didn&#x27;t match as well as I thought it was going to but if you don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s a great product</li>
    <li> Love the bang ..it looks like real hair</li>
    <li> Looks really fake has too much shinny  than others bangs so I don&#x27;t like at all.&lt;br /&gt;Soooo I hate it!</li>
    <li> This is a great piece. I wear it under a bandana or hat when I&#x27;m going for the &amp;#34;bang&amp;#34; look. It does look shiny, so it doesn&#x27;t look as natural as I would like it to.</li>
    <li> Love it, love how it lays, love how it&#x27;s styled.  A great piece for a low price.  Colors are a bit darker than advertised, though (as opposed to their other products), and dark brown turned out more black than brown.  So, not perfect, but at 5-6 dollars, I&#x27;m not looking for perfection.  Reordering a lighter color and hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> Great for a change when you don&#x27;t want to cut your own hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for daily use the more you care for it the better your look will be .</li>
    <li> Was the wrong color and was extremely uneven haven&#x27;t used them once ! I don&#x27;t usually like leaving bad reviews but it was needed! But then again for the price can&#x27;t really say much .Only good thing was that it did come on time . fast delivery, not so good quality:(</li>
    <li> Impossible to match to your hair color. There is no standard color guide listed. Everybody knows 1 is jet black, 2 is off black and so on......save your money.</li>
    <li> I loved these bangs...The original color I ordered was too light, but I contacted the seller and they were so nice to send another one in the right color...The hair feels soft and real...And it easily clips in to your hair...Super cute to play with!</li>
    <li> Terribly poor quality</li>
    <li> The dark brown is really more medium to light brown. doesn&#x27;t stay in place very well. have to wear it with a wide head band.</li>
    <li> I love the product. It looks so natural. It looks like my own hair. I am loving the option to have bangs or not. The whole processing of buying it was perfect as well.</li>
    <li> These bangs are actually pretty great, considering the price. I think the color is just a bit lighter than shown in the picture, but they matched my hair well. They do come a bit shiny but I dusted them with some dry shampoo, and it now looks a lot more natural. I give it a 4 on quality but it is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However- not everyone&#x27;s forehead is the same size. You may have to have someone trim these bangs for you, or do it yourself. Personally, if I place the bangs so far back that they fall at my brow, they look fake. After moving them forward and trimming they look much more real, though. I&#x27;m not detracting a star for this because I actually think its better to have them a bit long then trimmed to fit your face, it makes them look much better. You should be aware of this before purchasing, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little playing with the clips to make them lay flat, but with some practice I think these look fairly natural. I can&#x27;t really imagine wearing them with your hair up, though. I don&#x27;t think they could look natural that way.</li>
    <li> This is a great product with a very affordable price. Although it is not the right color for me. But looks very real.</li>
    <li> since its so perfect you need the rest of you to look the part as well otherwise you will look like a weave wearer not a natural looking bang just a perfect one and no one is perfect so I gave it an OK</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely LOVES this item! She wore it to school for the first time today... only one person noticed it was a clip b/c it was &#x27;too shiny&#x27;. It matched her hair color perfectly! It is easy to use and stays put. She wears a wide headband to cover the &#x27;mark&#x27; or &#x27;bump&#x27; that the clip leaves.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased when I received and tried on the false bangs; they look very convincing!  I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t match my hair color well enough, and although they don&#x27;t match it EXACTLY it&#x27;s still very convincing unless you&#x27;re up close.  I plan to use these for cosplay and if I feel like having bangs without cutting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for cosplayers and people who like to change up their hairstyle without anything being permanent.</li>
    <li> These do not blend with the hair, the blunt line makes it nearly impossible and the texture is very off.</li>
    <li> DISAPPOINTED IN THE COLOR AND QUALITY; AND, I CAN&#x27;T KEEP IT ON WITH THE CLIPS THAT ARE ATTACHED ...HYSTERICALLY FUNNY STORY, THOUGH, WHEN IT POPPED OFF AND FELL IN MY SALAD, WHILE HAVING A ROMANTIC DINNER WITH MY HUSBAND, AT AN UPSCALE MEMPHIS RESTAURANT!  IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO &amp;#34;LUCY&amp;#34; ... I SHOULD&#x27;VE KNOWN BETTER ... YOU KNOW ... IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT USUALLY IS ...  M Roberts</li>
    <li> Meh. Looks fake. I want to cut bangs so I really just wanted it to get an idea of what I would look lie with bangs before I take the plunge. The color is very specific and too light for my hair.</li>
    <li> Worked well and arrived in a timely manner. A bit confused about the coloring so ended up reordering.</li>
    <li> Items received in a timely matter.</li>
    <li> It looks to fake and the dark brown wasn&#x27;t dark enough.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on and the color is pretty.</li>
    <li> I bought this just to play around with my hair style.&lt;br /&gt;The price was ok-I got it within a week-that really made me happy!&lt;br /&gt; So I&#x27;ve been wearing it every so often-and I do get complimented on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is-there&#x27;s a slight part in my bangs that doesn&#x27;t wanna blend-but that is ok.</li>
    <li> quality of product is great. only gave 4 stars because no the right color. But for the pice, i am not complaining.</li>
    <li> There ok not took me awhiletntt t tttTHtten&amp;&amp;ehto get a ha</li>
    <li> total waste of money!!! Took a month to receive and it did not even come close to matching my hair I ordered dark brown but it was a light to medium brown and totally fake looking.  Thank goodness it was only 5.99 so if you order it order a shade or two darker than your own hair, but remember there is a difinate line where it clips on so you will need to wear a hairband with it.</li>
    <li> Different color from what was described. The dark brown was way lighter than expected.</li>
    <li> This is so  nice. My daughter loves it and it&#x27;s the exact colour of her own hair. Very soft, shiny and looks real. OBVIOUSLY as everyone has a different shaped head (my daughter has a low forehead whereas mine is high) so she just gave it a little trim and it&#x27;s perfect. Very happy and satisfied,  The service was excellent and the price just can&#x27;t be beat. My daughter is very happy :O)</li>
    <li> These are cool to use to change up your look. They don&#x27;t look very real, but they are fun to use.</li>
    <li> These are as described, but are hard to wear on there own. The length makes it hard to pin and look believable. I gave them to my 3 year old to play dress up with.</li>
    <li> I got it way sooner than expected. I&#x27;m going on vacation next week and I&#x27;m so excited I get to show them off. Ty Ty Ty!</li>
    <li> This product is best when you have bobby pins to secure it, as the included clips do not work that well for wearing it as actual bangs.  I found them hard to close.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing...ordered dark brown.. Got medium ash blonde kinda bangs.. Doesn&#x27;t blend with natural hair... Not worth the money..</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t horrible but they just look very unnatural. The only way I will be able to where them is if I cut them so they&#x27;re more fringed or wispy.  I also feel I can only where if I pull my hair back with headband. Quick ship though and color seemed pretty good.</li>
    <li> Ok, the first thing to keep in mind here is: You&#x27;re paying $6. This isn&#x27;t going to be a super high quality, wearable right out of the box hair piece. But on the other hand, for $6, this is MUCH better quality than what you would expect. With a little bit of working, a little hairspray, some bobby pins, this is totally cute, and very wearable. Please check out my pictures for a better idea of what you are getting.</li>
    <li> Just too much bang, too long and too high on the head--also the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; started to fall out the first day.</li>
    <li> Hairs started falling out as I took it out the package.</li>
    <li> Color was not dark brown - much lighter.</li>
    <li> I thought I brought the black one, however, the one I received is a blond one...Can&#x27;t use</li>
    <li> Dissapointed. The color was off, the clip to hold in place was too small, would not stay in hair.  I bought as a &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; piece, i would have returned for refund, but shipping was more than the cost of item and I wasn&#x27;t paying S&amp;H twice.</li>
    <li> The hair is very soft, feels real, and falls well. Brown is actually dark brown. It looks exactly as in the picture. It also came with 2 extra replacement clips. It was a lot of fun to play around with it. Also the price really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, but I think it still looks cool. It is a little darker than my natural color, but I&#x27;ve heard you can color them as long as you don&#x27;t bleach it. Kind of wish they had the combs all the way across the piece even though one will hold it well. Great coverage and natural looking. Wish there was a tutorial with it though. I love it.</li>
    <li> Does not look Caucasian hair. Too shinny and so it is obvious that it is a clip in.</li>
    <li> Not as fringed in front as expected. Very thick and heavy look - Not what I expected. Because the bangs are so thick its hard to hide the clip in. For the record I have VERY thick hair!</li>
    <li> looks really fake unless you have a ton of hair to blend it with. And buy some shine spray for your hair the piece very shiney. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> wrong color. I ordered dark brown and was medium to light brown. Can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Liked this hair piece.  Was ready to use right out of the envelope.  Unfortunately it was lighter then my hair color so I will try to dye to match.  Easy to put in.  Very cute for change up.</li>
