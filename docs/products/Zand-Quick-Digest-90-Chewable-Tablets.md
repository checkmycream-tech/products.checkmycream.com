HOWEVER unless I got a bad batch or something &amp; I can usually take things others think taste bad too, These are god awful tasting! Citrus great taste my A** lol.

    <li> Best product on the market. Taken before or after a meal and whenever you need relief. Better than any antacids I have tried. Good for bloating issues too.</li>
    <li> These really work I eat one everytime I&#x27;m about to eat and I eat another after a meal and it keeps me from being bloated no lie try it especially when I eat greasy foods and whenever you eat greasy foods always remember to drink warm to hot water with your food never cold the grease freeze up making it harder to digest I got that off of dr oz show</li>
    <li> After attaining the magical age of 50, I find that the nurtionists are right. Digestion does slow down with age....but these enzyme based supplements appear to be magic. Gone are the stomach bubbles, noises and gurgles and it seems as though digestion is enhanced by chewing one of these either before or after meals. I started out with one before dinner and never once did I get a grumbly stomach....I even could eat ice cream with no stomach bloating. Now I take them with dinner and at lunch as well. Very effective and a sweet, but not too sweet, pleasant taste.</li>
    <li> I dropped a star because it contains sweeteners. I just hope I can find this digestive aid in capsule form. Otherwise, it works great.</li>
    <li> This helps my stomach so much, love this stuff</li>
    <li> These natural tablets always soothe and settle my digestion, they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> I make sure I carry Quick Digest with me when travelling to calm indigestion.  I have difficulty with pepper which is added to many foods as well as wheat sensitivities.  Works quickly and I carry them in my bag or car.</li>
    <li> These work quickly and the taste is citrus, not bad. It also comes in a travel tube.</li>
    <li> Great for people with digestive problems or just big meals.</li>
    <li> Great supplementation for digestion issues. Most frequently we suffer from indigestion, bloating, upset stomach just from eating the wrong foods that taste so good! And these Zand chewables give quick relief with no side effects. I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> A great help when my stomach isn&#x27;t feeling right.</li>
    <li> I honestly think this works well along with probiotics.</li>
    <li> These tablets are amazing...  Ate dinner at my sister in laws house and had severe stomach ache and bloating issues...Lots of gas coming out as belches and couldn&#x27;t stand straight because the gas was so extreme.  Passed a Whole Foods and looked for some probiotics.  Found these instead and have been hooked ever since.  I will say I&#x27;m a life long fan now!!!</li>
    <li> These are great to help support digestion.  I usually take one after dinner and it has made a huge difference for me.  It has a nice flavor and you chew it like a piece of candy.</li>
