      <li>I love the texture of this lipstick but the colors are very, very light.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re a nice light wash of color.</li>
      <li>I truly Love this Product....</li>
      <li>But thank you NYX, I&#x27;m impressed and will be shopping from you more in the future!</li>
      <li>These are pretty awesome if you&#x27;r really into PINKS!</li>
      <li>They have an overwhelming sunscreen-like scent and they sting my lips.</li>
      <li>My FAVORITE color is &amp;#34;strawberry milk&amp;#34; .</li>
      <li>They go on so creamy and smooth, I love them.</li>
      <li>super creamy!</li>
      <li>others are too light to apply on my skin tone</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re creamy and smooth.</li>
      <li>beautiful shades of pink.</li>
      <li>I just love this round lipstick collection from nyx, they have this nice and soft covering and beautiful colors, I recommend.</li>
      <li>its a beautiful Barbie pink!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it was quick and neat</li>
      <li>But overall it was pretty  good.</li>
      <li>I like the colors and the price was right</li>
      <li>/&gt;they&#x27;re pretty okay with the lasting power.</li>
      <li>strawberry milk is a little too creamy and light for my taste but is still easy to work with.</li>
      <li>Light enough for every day</li>
      <li>again texture is really creamy and not drying...</li>
      <li>They smell and taste very waxy.</li>
      <li>These lipsticks are very moisturizing and pigmented.  </li>
      <li>Very creamy, even application.</li>
      <li>Lipstick was very moisturizing but still stayed on for quite a while.</li>
      <li>So be aware they are soft.</li>
      <li>As a very good customer of Sephora and all its very expensive brands, I decided to give this NYX company a try to see if I&#x27;m really getting what I&#x27;m paying for.</li>
      <li>the color payoff is great the only thing that sucked was that 3 of them came broken</li>
      <li>I would say they are not for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I think they last on lips fairly decent...</li>
      <li>The first time I tried on the purpley pink  </li>
      <li>very professional formula for the low price.</li>
      <li>I like the variety of colors however, the quality isn&#x27;t really what I expected.  </li>
      <li>Nice array of colors that go with formal as well as casual look.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave four stars as opposed to five for this particular review is because I would have wished just a little more variation in color choices within the pink spectrum, like maybe an orangey pink.</li>
      <li>I was a little dissapointed that the colors looked very similar,but you can tell their not.</li>

<li> Very weird look to them.</li>
<li> 2 of my lipsticks came In a bad condition.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The nyx Rround lipsticks are great.. if you don&#x27;t want a boom in your face lipstick they&#x27;re a nice light wash of color.</li>
    <li> I like the variety of colors however, the quality isn&#x27;t really what I expected.  It seems like it&#x27;s sitting ON your lips instead of blending into the skin if that makes sense.  I like the colors and the price was right but I probably won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> the colors are different and lighter than what they appear on the picture..i just like 3 out of 6...others are too light to apply on my skin tone</li>
    <li> Love these nyx lipsticks! so creamy and decently last long! My FAVORITE color is &amp;#34;strawberry milk&amp;#34; . its a beautiful Barbie pink! Light enough for every day</li>
    <li> I just love this round lipstick collection from nyx, they have this nice and soft covering and beautiful colors, I recommend.</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are incredibly creamy in texture and the colors available are beautiful....wear them alone or mix the shades when using a lipbrush. I think they last on lips fairly decent...may need to touch up after eating or drinking...again texture is really creamy and not drying...very professional formula for the low price.</li>
    <li> All the colors are beautiful I especially loved the nude and the Lilly purple ones the color payoff is great the only thing that sucked was that 3 of them came broken</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and the colors look great.</li>
    <li> Nice array of colors that go with formal as well as casual look.</li>
    <li> Surprise! As a very good customer of Sephora and all its very expensive brands, I decided to give this NYX company a try to see if I&#x27;m really getting what I&#x27;m paying for. I ordered this lipstick set and some of their lip liners. For the price, I&#x27;m delighted with the quality of these lipsticks. Very creamy, even application. The quality of the lipstick as well as the lip liners I bought is nearly on par or on par with the very expensive stuff I&#x27;ve been buying from Sephora. The only reason I gave four stars as opposed to five for this particular review is because I would have wished just a little more variation in color choices within the pink spectrum, like maybe an orangey pink. But thank you NYX, I&#x27;m impressed and will be shopping from you more in the future!</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are very moisturizing and pigmented.  My lips are naturally red and these lipsticks cover them without a primer.  I am displeased with the scent though. They have an overwhelming sunscreen-like scent and they sting my lips. I would say they are not for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Half the lipsticks were melting or are in very odd condition, as if they&#x27;re broken and falling apart. They smell and taste very waxy. The colors are not like the picture, these are very pale and half I can&#x27;t use because of my olive skin tone. Not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> 2 of my lipsticks came In a bad condition.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this lipstick but the colors are very, very light. I don&#x27;t like the look of lips that are lighter than the rest of your face.</li>
    <li> These are pretty awesome if you&#x27;r really into PINKS! When I opened them and tried them  on  I was a little dissapointed that the colors looked very similar,but you can tell their not.The first time I tried on the purpley pink  it boke and now I stuck using a lipstick brush to use it.So be aware they are soft.But overall it was pretty  good.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite lip sticks! They go on so creamy and smooth, I love them.</li>
    <li> I truly Love this Product.... 😍😍😍😍😘😘</li>
    <li> A  great  lipstick  set.  This  lipstick  set  is  great  as it  comes in a variety of  colors. IT is  great  .</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re great lipsticks I was just really sad when one of the shades broke :(&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still in the tube but it&#x27;s upsetting that I cannot roll it out .... all the others are&lt;br /&gt;great. they&#x27;re creamy and smooth. they do not last too long if you&#x27;re eating and drinking ... but&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re pretty okay with the lasting power.</li>
    <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
    <li> Got two repeated color.. looks like i bought only 3 colors</li>
    <li> i like the colors alot&lt;br /&gt;the packaging and everything was perfect and sent right away&lt;br /&gt;it was quick and neat</li>
    <li> I cant get over all the amazing colors!</li>
    <li> comes off in  minutes</li>
    <li> Loved the colors. Lipstick was very moisturizing but still stayed on for quite a while.</li>
    <li> and this is no exception. beautiful shades of pink. super creamy! strawberry milk is a little too creamy and light for my taste but is still easy to work with.</li>
    <li> These lipsticks went on like crayons. Very weird look to them. They were creamy though, but went on like a matte but crayon-like. I do not like the way they look at all.</li>
    <li> Nice pices for my Grand daughter to go with the kit purchased!</li>
