      <li>It smoothed the lines around my eyes and made the concealer work better.</li>

      <li>No joke, after one use my eyes looked better.  </li>
      <li>have used many things, including prescriptions, for my skin...</li>
      <li>I love - just yet.  </li>
      <li>It feels refreshing on your skin too.</li>
      <li>Have used many eye creams and they always end up having that tacky feeling.</li>
      <li>Glad I found this on Amazon ..</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any of Peter Thomas Roth products that I didn&#x27;t absolutely love.  </li>
      <li>Anything will work better than this stuff.</li>
      <li>i wanted to love it</li>
      <li>just wanting to do their part to prevent any fine lines from forming.</li>
      <li>Has helped with fine lines and smoothing my eyelids.</li>
      <li>I think its made a huge difference in the texture of my skin</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of PTR products.</li>
      <li>-I started with the sample kit (its a great buy) and now have moved on to the larger sizes.</li>
      <li>B00B649JPQ Peter Thomas Roth - Laser-Free Resurfacing Kit (4pcs)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the laser free line of products</li>
      <li>and I thank God, my Heavenly Father, that this product is available to me.  </li>
      <li>Well, I got this product as part of a set that I got free at Sephora because I had a lot of points.</li>
      <li>My eyelids look and feel rejuvenated and smooth.</li>
      <li>This serum has softened my lines and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>the product goes smooth</li>
      <li>I bought the Laser Free Rurfacing eye serum.</li>
      <li>I got it 3 days ago and have been using it in the am and pm and so far so good.</li>
      <li>After reading so many great reviews, I had to try this product to treat the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It moisturizes and the colored cream gives my face a pretty healthy look.</li>
      <li>HOPE IT CAN KEEP ON USEFUL !</li>
      <li>However, I use other Peter Thomas Roth products and if this one is as good as the others, I know I will be supremely pleased.</li>
      <li>the AMAZING unexpected thing happened.</li>
      <li>I have to make sure that the serum can&#x27;t come close to my eyes, otherwise it will really stink my eyes...</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see the full benefit in a month.</li>
      <li>HE IS A TRUE TALENT</li>
      <li>Had to return because I got rash on my face, apparently it was old, but I wish I got to try it better since it did get good reviews</li>
      <li>For many years I had suffered from Chalazions that would last for 1/2 year or more.</li>
      <li>and they would pop up and then disappear many, many months later.</li>
      <li>Having lived 60 years in the south and spending many hours in the hot afternoon summer sun, now at 66 I&#x27;ve come to understand the effects of sun damage and of course am now very distressed about the look of my skin.  </li>
      <li>My skin became very pretty, feels soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t think it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Easily absorbed and skin looks smoother.</li>
      <li>It, as well as all of the Roth products that I have used, gives my skin a dewy, moist, fresh looking appearance.  </li>
      <li>Being an older lady, I have experienced dry eye syndrome, and almost every eye product causes flaking in the corners of my eyes.  </li>
      <li>and I feel that I have to put cheaper moisturizer on top of Camu for my face to look and feel natural.</li>
      <li>So, right there alone I would recommend it</li>
      <li>After one month of use, the fine lines around my eyes are completely removed.</li>
      <li>I noticed results right away and received positive comments.  </li>
      <li>Wow, just 2 days I seen a huge difference.</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend it for use at night, but I would beware of putting makeup over it until you can be sure they don&#x27;t react.</li>
      <li>I love Peter Thomas Roth products especially the Camu Camu and this eye serum.</li>
      <li>I am so excited about being able to use this without the flaking that I forgot to mention the other benefits from the product.  </li>
      <li>Not 1/2 way through the first bottle.  </li>
      <li>FINALLY- a product that delivers on it&#x27;s promises and more.  </li>
      <li>and it really helps!</li>
      <li>but this product is the first thing on my lids morning and night.</li>
      <li>Love this product especially at this price.</li>
      <li>the area around my eyes soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any results as of yet but feels good and isn&#x27;t heavy</li>
      <li>Was very excited to find this product on Amazon after having looked at it first at Macy&#x27;s for double the price.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a large vein under the right eye that is the main contributor to the darkness under the skin.</li>
      <li>Instead of my face feeling more moisture after applying this product it feels dry</li>
      <li>This product does little smooth and absolutely will not lessen wrinkles or fine lines.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like the product so far.  Time will tell how well  it works</li>
    <li> I saw all of the good reviews on Camu Camu complex and I thought I could not go wrong, however, so far after trying the product for a couple of days now I think this purchase was a waste of money. Instead of my face feeling more moisture after applying this product it feels dry and I feel that I have to put cheaper moisturizer on top of Camu for my face to look and feel natural. Upon applying Camu Camu it feels as if I have a tight, dry mask on that focuses on my wrinkles even more. Take my advice and purchase a tried and true product such as Olay Total effects. Anything will work better than this stuff. I cannot even give one star as I  am really disapointed in the results of this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Easily absorbed and skin looks smoother.</li>
    <li> After reading so many great reviews, I had to try this product to treat the dark circles under my eyes.  After just 2 weeks (using am &amp; pm), the dark circles under my eyes are nearly gone!  I no longer use concealer.  I now just use my foundation or BB cream for my eye area.</li>
    <li> Good price for a good product</li>
    <li> Peter Thomas products are amazing; this product is a miracle worker on my eyes!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  If you have wrinkles, this is the product for you!  I have been amazed at the results!</li>
    <li> love the way this feels on my eyes.  like is so much I am going to order the face resurfacer as well.</li>
    <li> Does work, but it is very strong.  I have had a few issues where my eyelids have gotten burned from it and have had considerable swelling.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to pair well with the IT under eye concealer, which is where I was having problems.  Now, I just apply at bedtime, and don&#x27;t wear it during the day with makeup.  Definitely recommend it for use at night, but I would beware of putting makeup over it until you can be sure they don&#x27;t react.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any of Peter Thomas Roth products that I didn&#x27;t absolutely love.  This product is no exception, just great.  Being an older lady, I have experienced dry eye syndrome, and almost every eye product causes flaking in the corners of my eyes.  I assume it is the product and the running of my eyes mixing together.  It is very irritating to deal with this.  But this product doesn&#x27;t do that.  So enough said to say I am absolutely sold on this product.  I am so excited about being able to use this without the flaking that I forgot to mention the other benefits from the product.  It, as well as all of the Roth products that I have used, gives my skin a dewy, moist, fresh looking appearance.  It gives this older skin a youthful renewal.</li>
    <li> i being using this product for a month i do not see any difference , i will not buy it again , i just turn 40 , no significant lines around my eyes but i have dark circles (family) the product goes smooth i wanted to love it but i do not see any difference</li>
    <li> Having lived 60 years in the south and spending many hours in the hot afternoon summer sun, now at 66 I&#x27;ve come to understand the effects of sun damage and of course am now very distressed about the look of my skin.  And I&#x27;m thinking now that I&#x27;m up north in the dry cold I&#x27;m paying double fold for the follies of my youth.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the Peter Thomas Roth Retinol Fusion PM, in conjunction with the Peter Thomas Roth Laser-free Resurfacing eye serum AND the Laser-free Regenerator moisturizing gel-cream have totally transformed my skin from horrible lines and wrinkles  I hated to see in the mirror to a much smoother complexion.  Each morning I now see myself in the mirror I am totally amazed and ever so thankful that I&#x27;ve come across this product that has made the world of difference to my face.  I think its made a huge difference in the texture of my skin and I think I&#x27;m looking at least 10 years younger.  No more cross-hatch marks or fine lines visible and other wrinkles also have been diminished.  And I also think those marionette lines from the corner of the nose to mouth are also less obvious if not almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;Gotta tell ya, I get up each morning to check out my new complexion in the &#x27;sunlight&#x27; and I thank God, my Heavenly Father, that this product is available to me.  And thank you, Peter Thomas Roth.</li>
    <li> It have dry skin and it really helps! It moisturizes and the colored cream gives my face a pretty healthy look. I always thought I can&#x27;t find something that fits my needs but this cream is awesome! My skin became very pretty, feels soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> This hardly lives up to the manufacturer&#x27;s claims and yet the price remains high.  This product does little smooth and absolutely will not lessen wrinkles or fine lines.  A waste of money!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of PTR products. But with this particular product, I ended up with an under eye irritation. I thought it was my skin just getting use to the product but unfortunately, after a few attempts it still made them red and itchy.</li>
    <li> I began using this product about a year and a half ago. I&#x27;m 73, male and I inherited my mother&#x27;s dark shadows under my eyes. The promos on QVC touted the effectiveness for my kind of problem. I have noticed a visible difference under my left eye; however I&#x27;ve seen almost no improvement under my right eye. There&#x27;s a large vein under the right eye that is the main contributor to the darkness under the skin. Under my right eye there&#x27;s no large vein. I continue to apply the &amp;#34;red stuff&amp;#34; every morning and just before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;I just started buying the product from Amazon. It is about $15 less than ordering from QVC. I don&#x27;t begrudge QVC their profit as they have to sell their products on live TV and Amazon does not.</li>
    <li> noticeable difference after just a few weeks, and a little bit goes a long way.  dark circles are diminishing and fine lines are les visible.  price on amazon much better than qvc or other websites.  highly recommend, very good quality as with all peter thomas roth products.</li>
    <li> I have used this product now for a month.  It has smoothed the crows feet around my eyes and the dark circles seem a bit diminished.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed to learn this serum contains carmine (crushed cochineal bugs). I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s necessary for manufacturers to add bugs for pigment and would prefer items be a natural color.</li>
    <li> Really love this eye cream! It is a gel formula so a little goes a long way. I have noticed a difference in my eye area. Have used many eye creams and they always end up having that tacky feeling. This will not disappoint!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about eye creams as I have dark circles (not bad ones, but they&#x27;re there) and I&#x27;m constantly searching the internet for reviews on products. I found some glowing reviews on this particular eye serum so I decided to order it. I got it 3 days ago and have been using it in the am and pm and so far so good. The consistency of this is like gel like and it&#x27;s a cranberry color. So far I&#x27;ve noticed that my dark circles are fading a little. It feels refreshing on your skin too. I don&#x27;t think anything is a miracle for dark circles but so far this eye serum is working pretty well....keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet how it works, because i&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time. But, any other eye cream I have used stings my  eye if I cry or my allergies act up and this one does not. So, right there alone I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Not sure if I like it or I love - just yet.  Not 1/2 way through the first bottle.  Has helped with fine lines and smoothing my eyelids.</li>
    <li> Great stuff-I started with the sample kit (its a great buy) and now have moved on to the larger sizes. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I noticed results right away and received positive comments.  I have purchased several from this supplier. Great price  I cannot see me without it</li>
    <li> After one month of use, the fine lines around my eyes are completely removed. Darkened under eye color and puffiness is dramatically reduced. I am hooked!</li>
    <li> The product is effective for under eye depuffing! I used very little and you do have to keep using it every day!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;Makes the area around my eyes soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> The product and the service met my expectations. I would use this source again in the future. Product Met Expectations.</li>
    <li> this is the best product ever.  It keeps my skin soft.  I have used this product for about 3 months and I can see a big difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product especially at this price. I bought two!</li>
    <li> Found this to be absolutely great. Saw a big difference within two days. My eyelids look and feel rejuvenated and smooth. It seems like they are firmer. Much easier now to use eyeliner.</li>
    <li> so far I love this stuff only thing that seems to work</li>
    <li> As will all PTR products - this eye serum is great. I love it. I would highly reccomend it to anyone (I&#x27;m early 30&#x27;s) just wanting to do their part to prevent any fine lines from forming. I have no eye puffiness or dark circles so I&#x27;m not sure how it would have affected those, however, the skin around my eyes look dewy and healthy and fresh so I truly cannot complain...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this, the red color, the ugly smell and it does nothing for my undereye area.  This is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am 33 and the cold weather was taking a toll on my already puffy and incoming crows feet.  I&#x27;ve been using various eye serums and none have left me satisfied.  This serum has softened my lines and leaves my skin feeling smooth. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have to make sure that the serum can&#x27;t come close to my eyes, otherwise it will really stink my eyes...</li>
    <li> Was very excited to find this product on Amazon after having looked at it first at Macy&#x27;s for double the price. Used the product for about 3 weeks and the results were as if I had been using nothing at all. The serum itself is a blood red color so it was very strange at first when I would apply it under my eyes. Forgot where I had put my receipt and the box it came in so I just ended up using it on the tops of my hands till it was gone.</li>
    <li> For many years I had suffered from Chalazions that would last for 1/2 year or more. I would get them once every year or two and they would pop up and then disappear many, many months later. Well, I got this product as part of a set that I got free at Sephora because I had a lot of points. I used the products as directed and immediately noticed a major improvement to my skin.but the AMAZING unexpected thing happened. Within a few weeks my NEWLY popped up Chalazion disappeared. I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT... So I researched the product and it&#x27;s ingredients and learned about dragons blood. After the eye serum was gone I replaced it with a different one and several months later noticed that a chalaza returned. So I promptly repurchased this eye serum again and the problem resolved in about 4 weeks.  So, I will always use this product and add others on top...but this product is the first thing on my lids morning and night.</li>
    <li> I was using Dermadoctor Red Light eye serum for 5 weeks and saw no significant improvement.  I received a PTR sample from Sephora and decided to apply PTR to one eye and Dermadoctor to my other eye.  Wow!!!, saw an immediate result within one day using PTR!  I would estimate over the past 3 weeks that I have experienced a 40% improvement in puffiness, dark circles and fine wrinkles.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my eye area either as one should apply PTR over the upper lid, along the crows feet and undereye area - amazing because I am usually quite sensitive to products.  Amazon had the better price for the PTR serum compared to Sephora and Ulta salon.</li>
    <li> I love Peter Thomas Roth products especially the Camu Camu and this eye serum. My skin looks brighter and younger and the results are instant!!!</li>
    <li> Clearly the product had been opened and tampered with -  parts of the pump assembly were completely missing, to the point that the product could not be dispensed using the pump nozzle.  Furthermore the box appeared to be sealed on the bottom using a printable address label as a retail sticker, I can only assume for the purpose of concealing signs of tampering.</li>
    <li> I can only give this product 4 stars for now, since I have been using it for less than a month. However, I use other Peter Thomas Roth products and if this one is as good as the others, I know I will be supremely pleased.</li>
    <li> Great product, fabulous seller! I am 55; have always taken stellar care of my skin but was really noticing bags which I hate, lol! I honestly was considering surgery to remove them.  This serum is nothing less that  a miracle worker; no one can believe I&#x27;m 55 with 10 grandchildren, and my bags  are gone. I&#x27;ve always been very careful with my skin to avoid being &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34;....I just hated the idea, but the bags made me feel old and tired all the time; no more.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, but I have only been using the product for two weeks, I cannot say that I have noticed a difference yet.  I am giving it a couple of months before I pass judgement.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00B649JPQ Peter Thomas Roth - Laser-Free Resurfacing Kit (4pcs)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the laser free line of products 2x daily for one week and my skin is noticeably different.  I can&#x27;t say I know if it&#x27;s one product or all four combined, but my lines are softer, my blemishes are gone, the bumps beneath the surface are GONE.  Really.&lt;br /&gt;I have adult cystic acne, I am scarred from 40+ years of acne and sun damage.  The improvement is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I have had one or two blemishes since starting, which I attribute to purification, but they weren&#x27;t angry, painful or terribly inflamed, which is my norm.  They are easily concealed with make-up and the rapid healing is nothing like I&#x27;ve ever experienced before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many things, including prescriptions, for my skin...this by far is showing wonderful progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some products have not held up in the long term for me, I really hope I still feel this way in six months because this may be my miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly urge people to try and will share this information with anyone who asks (my daughter already noticed the difference!)</li>
    <li> Miracle worker!  I can&#x27;t believe what this product has done for my eyes.  It took about 3 weeks to notice a change.  I have now been using for about 2 months now, and my eye area continues to improve.  The bags are almost gone and the wrinkles are nonexistent.  My allergies have been terrible lately, but on a good allergy day no under eye circles are present.  I can not say enough positive things about this product!  I have tried so many eye creams and serums, this is they best one I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This product was absolutely wonderful I will highly recommended. It has began to diminish find lines and age spots under the eyes . I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Used this product recently... it is great.  Glad I found this on Amazon ..</li>
    <li> Love Peter Thomas Roth products, love this price!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day for about 3 months. I don&#x27;t see any difference and don&#x27;t think I will order it again.</li>
    <li> It was when I stopped using it, that I realized how much it worked. It smoothed the lines around my eyes and made the concealer work better.</li>
    <li> At least I don&#x27;t notice anything getting worse, though, either. For the price, I don&#x27;t think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I was a philosophy girl for years and did some research on Sephora on a good anti-aging serum. I bought the Laser Free Rurfacing eye serum. Wow, just 2 days I seen a huge difference.Even getting compliments at work. I was literally days from trying Botox but after trying Peter Thomas Roth I canceled my appt. Best skin line in the world</li>
    <li> Ordered this after research online. Haven&#x27;t seen any results as of yet but feels good and isn&#x27;t heavy and I&#x27;m very sensitive to things and it didn&#x27;t hurt or give me a rash which is a plus :)</li>
    <li> VERY USEFUL SKIN SERUM, HELP ME REDUCE LITTLE WRINKLES!!! I LOVE IT ! HOPE IT CAN KEEP ON USEFUL !</li>
    <li> I HAD ENTERTAINED THE THOUGHT OF GIVING UP ON THESE BAGS UNDER MY EYES (  A HERD OF CATTLE COULD FEED FROM THE THINGS!!!  ) AND PUFFINESS TO BOOT!!!!  BUT ENTER PTR&#x27;S LASER FREE RESURFACING EYE SERUM ON A SHOPPING CHANNEL ON TV, ALONG WITH PTR , LIVE AND IN HANDSOME PERSON!!!!!  I  GAVE THE PRODUCT ABOUT 10 SECONDS OF THOUGHT AFTER I HEARD WHAT IT PURPORTEDLY WAS SUPPOSED TO DO AND I IMMEDIATELY GOT ON LINE STRAIGHT TO MY HEADQUARTERS FOR ALL THINGS GREAT, AMAZON, AND THERE IT WAS ALONG WITH THE WHOLE LINE OF PETER THOMAS ROTH. ( I LIKE TO SAY ALL THREE NAMES AT ONCE ). BACK TO THE EYES.... I ONLY WISH I HAD TAKEN A &amp;#34; BEFORE &amp;#34; PICTURE SURROUNDED BY THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FAILED EYE CREAM!!!!! TAKE MY WORD FOR IT AND BUY THIS MAN&#x27;S PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON ( BEST PRICE AND RETURN POLICY )...I DOUBT THERE WILL BE ANY RETURNS!!!!  HE IS A CLASS ACT AND HIS PRODUCTS FOLLOW SUIT!  HE IS A TRUE TALENT AND WE GET TO BENEFIT.  THANK YOU AMAZON FOR MAKING THINGS SO EASY TO OBTAIN!!!!</li>
    <li> Didnt work like i was hoping for but helped Thanks</li>
    <li> I have No review. It is ridiculous to have to use 18 or more words when you have nothing to say. What else is there to say.</li>
    <li> Had to return because I got rash on my face, apparently it was old, but I wish I got to try it better since it did get good reviews</li>
    <li> This product really does what it claims to do.  Been using as directed and my dark circles have disappeared!  Absorbs well, feels great.....will purchase again &amp; recommend to others!</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty remarkable!!! I immediately saw my crow&#x27;s feet diminish after the 1st use. They&#x27;re not all the way gone, but they are less noticeable. I can&#x27;t wait to see the full benefit in a month.</li>
    <li> FINALLY- a product that delivers on it&#x27;s promises and more.  I read all the Amazon reviews(like always) and decided to give it a try.  No joke, after one use my eyes looked better.  I have that crapy eyelid and the chic skin bumps under my eyes and both have been radically deminished!  The product causes no irritation and I find it cooling as well. Buy it now!</li>
