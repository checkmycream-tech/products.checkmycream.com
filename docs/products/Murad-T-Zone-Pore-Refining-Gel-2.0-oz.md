      <li>This gel is the best I&#x27;ve ever used to clean and heal pores and blackheads.</li>
      <li>so i decided to find some cheaper but effective product to minimize my pores and i find this murad pore refining gel, had good reviews but</li>
      <li>Love this!  </li>
      <li>before i use shiseido  toner, it was a great product,i seldom get breakouts and had a smooth skin</li>
      <li>b) people who have used and liked Murad products before.</li>
      <li>Their whole line gives your skin a beautiful glow.</li>
      <li>It has changed the texture of my skin and has also reduced fine lines and wrinkles!  </li>
      <li>This product is great news for anyone who feels self-conscious about large pores and blackheads.</li>
      <li>, honestly is ok, I have been using it for 3 weeks</li>
      <li>I love all murad products and this one is one I put on every morning to give my face some color to it.  </li>
      <li>Just use it at night :)</li>
      <li>You are suppose to put a coat of face lotion on top of this product but it makes my face break out rather than minimize my pores.   </li>
      <li>If you use it this way in that order, you will love the product.  </li>
      <li>Ok, this product doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>There has never been any product that works with my skin better than Murad.</li>
      <li>you have perfect skin and just big pores</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impressed, and I&#x27;ll be buying it as long as they make it.</li>
      <li>I can see why this is patented, and it&#x27;s a huge shame that more people don&#x27;t know about it.</li>
      <li>My wife first used this product at a salon and has been very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I have in fact noticed my skin becoming clearer and it feels cleaner.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, no odor, have been using it every day.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t complain, she is easy to look at.</li>
      <li>It feels fine when I put it on but in combination with my oil reducer, moisturizer and make-up</li>
      <li>This product arrived quickly to my door!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really seem to effectively prevent breakouts.</li>
      <li>and I was excited about this product</li>
      <li>It is kind of thick and sticky, and it doesn&#x27;t smell all that great...</li>
      <li>, I bought it and use it if I&#x27;m not going to wear make-up, but if I&#x27;m going in full warpaint, I don&#x27;t end up using it.</li>
      <li>So far this product is great to control my t-zone, I had used many products for this issue and finally this work.  </li>
      <li>I finally returned it and had to take a store credit instead of a refund, and the credit wasn&#x27;t even for the full amount!!!  </li>
      <li>so I was glad to see I could get the same product A LOT cheaper with free shipping!  </li>
      <li>Overall, great product and I highly recommend it for people with combination skin!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recently started using this and love the scent!</li>
      <li>It is not so useful to me.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>It gives your face some color and is great for pale skinned people like myself.  </li>
      <li>But because this product seems to have strong anti-inflamatory properties, the breakouts you do get go by so much faster when using this, and afterward your skin is so much clearer than with anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews on Murad and it really works!  </li>
      <li>hopefully my skin will get better but for now i will give low star rating...</li>
      <li>My forehead is not oily at all anymore (even when I get hot), yet it has kept the rest of my skin moisturized all day.</li>
      <li>It just made my skin around the nose area flakey and led to more red spots.</li>
      <li>My pores are visibly smaller and my skin is super smooth.  </li>
      <li>I combined with Clean &amp; Clear oil control face wash</li>
      <li>Although it does seem to keep your face smooth and not dry.</li>
      <li>but i do have large pores so i was looking for an improvement in my pores which I didn&#x27;t see.</li>
      <li>Of course, the salon price was very high and my wife decided to shop around.  </li>
      <li>It really worked and helped my skin from breaking out.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel much difference by applying this solution to my face.</li>
      <li>Seller was very prompt with delivery also.</li>
      <li>Guess this product didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have acne</li>
      <li>I have a very porous face</li>
      <li>and it really helps control everything.</li>
      <li>If I had a teenager who was going through the bad skin problems I did at that age, I would consider this to be the most important thing that could help!!!</li>
      <li>I particularly wanted help with the large pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It helps keep my skin clear- better than other OTC face products.</li>
      <li>It has a very intensive smell, my boyfriend can&#x27;t be near me when i put it on, and it makes your face shiny.</li>
      <li>half-pump of the product covers my whole T-zone, so a little goes a long way, which makes the product more cost-effective than it may seem at first glance.  </li>
      <li>maybe i put too much on but it didn&#x27;t feel light, rather heavy and sticky.</li>
      <li>This was one of my first Murad products I began using when my friends esthetician instructor recommended it to me after my facial @ their school.</li>
      <li>I mainly use the Clinique moisturizing gel, however recently, I&#x27;ve been getting really oily on my forehead and dry pretty much everywhere on my cheek and around my mouth.</li>
      <li>I bought this to refine and shrink my pores, which it does an okay job of, but the miracle turned out to be finally having skin that no longer had dry and oily patches--and almost no breakouts!!!</li>
      <li>It gives your skin a healthy glow and slight tan look if used properly.</li>
      <li>She said it would help clear out the blackheads that were too stubborn to come out.</li>
      <li>The wife is made me buy this stuff several times now, she believes it really does what it says it does.  </li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin, so there are a lot of products I can&#x27;t use.</li>
      <li>so I know its not dried skin or anything.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Use it everyday for a light tan look.  </li>
      <li>First, recently I have noticed a white substance at the edges of my nose near my cheeks.</li>
      <li>Before I began using it, my pores (especially on and near my nose) would get congested and VERY visible to the naked eye.  </li>
      <li>The only downside is if your have oily skin, you must make sure to use only a small amount so that it doesnt bring out the oil in your skin.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product to a) people who have similar skin issues to those described above and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using murad products since my early to mid 20&#x27;s and now at 43, I still get carded to buy wine.  </li>
      <li>It stings a little after my shower (maybe because my pores are more open from the steam) but it may be that I&#x27;m a little bit products with sensitive to salicylic acid.</li>
      <li>After a few uses my skin was smooth and glowing, and within a few months I felt like a new person.</li>

<li> The first few times using this product actually made the t zone area rough and dry.</li>
<li> Only a little bit is necessary, so it last a long time.</li>
<li> Please be patient with the product or anything that exfoliates deeply over time, because I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s common when something is working to clear the pores to go through an initial phase where you break out some, because it&#x27;s pulling out everything all at once.</li>
<li> Sorry, but products like this for a first time- need to be purchased directly at the store...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve noticed as long as I blend my makeup</li>
<li> I have had inconsistent results--but only due to my inconsistent use.</li>
<li> It stings a little when putting it on, but only for a second.</li>
<li> I think it&#x27;s because of the dry heat in Arizona that I&#x27;m not used to.</li>
<li> it didn&#x27;t at all, yes my pores got smaller, but it made it harder to get my black heads out :</li>
<li> The biggest difference was in my wallet having a few extra $$ in it.  </li>
<li> I even use it on other ares where I get \\&quot;pimple\\&quot; type bumps.</li>
<li> I have brought other Murad products at</li>
<li> I apply 1-2 times about every other day and have seen some results.</li>
<li> I like the other Reform products</li>
<li> For me, there is a slight tingling sensation upon application, due to the exfoliating properties of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This product was definitely not worth the money for me.  </li>

    <li> After a few uses my skin was smooth and glowing, and within a few months I felt like a new person. After decades of problem skin and bad breakouts that had finally calmed down to just occasional breakouts--this turned out to be the missing ingredient to finally having the nice smooth skin again that I had before hitting puberty. I bought this to refine and shrink my pores, which it does an okay job of, but the miracle turned out to be finally having skin that no longer had dry and oily patches--and almost no breakouts!!! Please be patient with the product or anything that exfoliates deeply over time, because I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s common when something is working to clear the pores to go through an initial phase where you break out some, because it&#x27;s pulling out everything all at once. But because this product seems to have strong anti-inflamatory properties, the breakouts you do get go by so much faster when using this, and afterward your skin is so much clearer than with anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. Now if I do have a skin problem, it&#x27;s usually just one small blemish, and I put a few extra drops on just that area a few times a day. Then the blemish is usually gone by the next day, but if it does stay around a few days at least it doesn&#x27;t leave a scar like the blemishes I used to get. I can see why this is patented, and it&#x27;s a huge shame that more people don&#x27;t know about it. I&#x27;m impressed, and I&#x27;ll be buying it as long as they make it. If I had a teenager who was going through the bad skin problems I did at that age, I would consider this to be the most important thing that could help!!!</li>
    <li> I have definitely seen the improvements in my skin and minimized pores from this product. The only downside is if your have oily skin, you must make sure to use only a small amount so that it doesnt bring out the oil in your skin.</li>
    <li> This product used to be the \\&quot;Combination Skin Formula.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve used it for the last fifteen years.  Everytime I&#x27;ve tried a different skin serum, I notice a deterioration in my skin and go back to this product.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to every one who asks me what products I use. I&#x27;ve tried some very expensive products and always return to this one.</li>
    <li> i am using it for one month already...before i use shiseido  toner, it was a great product,i seldom get breakouts and had a smooth skin but it&#x27;s kinda pricey for 60 dollars so i decided to find some cheaper but effective product to minimize my pores and i find this murad pore refining gel, had good reviews but one month after using this,i started to have breakouts and my skin became shiny....hopefully my skin will get better but for now i will give low star rating...</li>
    <li> I have brought other Murad products at Murad website $$$$, so I was glad to see I could get the same product A LOT cheaper with free shipping!  Of course not all Murad products are offered at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love all murad products and this one is one I put on every morning to give my face some color to it.  It gives your face some color and is great for pale skinned people like myself.  Use it everyday for a light tan look.  Those whose review is not favorable do not understand how to use this product and should call Murad to understand the proper use of it.  This product should be used 3rd, after using the Essential C Cleanser, then then the Essential C Toner spray, then use the T Zone Pore Refining Gel.  If you use it this way in that order, you will love the product.  It gives your skin a healthy glow and slight tan look if used properly.</li>
    <li> This gel is the best I&#x27;ve ever used to clean and heal pores and blackheads. [[ASIN:B00170M8XE Murad T Zone Pore Refining Gel 2oz]] I even use it on other ares where I get \\&quot;pimple\\&quot; type bumps. Only a little bit is necessary, so it last a long time. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Ok, this product doesn&#x27;t work at all. It has a very intensive smell, my boyfriend can&#x27;t be near me when i put it on, and it makes your face shiny. You are suppose to put a coat of face lotion on top of this product but it makes my face break out rather than minimize my pores.   I have a very porous face and I was excited about this product but I have stopped using it and would not recommend it to anyone else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using this and love the scent! However, it has your skin looking a bit glossy because its a gel. I have in fact noticed my skin becoming clearer and it feels cleaner. Too soon to determine if it minimizes pores though but a good product.</li>
    <li> Before I purchase this I read reviews about it, honestly is ok, I have been using it for 3 weeks, I think my face still looks the same, I don&#x27;t see any diffrence, but maybe it takes time. So I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> This was one of my first Murad products I began using when my friends esthetician instructor recommended it to me after my facial @ their school. She said it would help clear out the blackheads that were too stubborn to come out. It really worked and helped my skin from breaking out. She suggested I use it once a week before bed along with the Murad clarifying mask, on another day. It tingles when it&#x27;s on at the beginning, and although it makes me want to scratch my face, I like it because I know somethings working. I use it to help control breakouts once or twice a week and the bottle goes a log way.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff have ordered several times</li>
    <li> I got this product 2 weeks ago &amp; it is definitely doing something. I particularly wanted help with the large pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say the pores are cleaner; however, they are not smaller yet. It sounds like that takes time though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I know the pores are cleaner is 2 reasons. First, recently I have noticed a white substance at the edges of my nose near my cheeks. While it sounds gross, I think it&#x27;s that sebum stuff that tends to clog pores. It wipes away in just a second so I know its not dried skin or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second when I apply makeup now I can actually see gaps where there are open pores. I&#x27;ve noticed as long as I blend my makeup well I can cover them. Hopefully those big open pores will just get smaller once I&#x27;ve used this for awhile.</li>
    <li> This product was definitely not worth the money for me.  I started breaking out really bad after I started using this. It seemed to clog my pores, not shrink them.  I finally returned it and had to take a store credit instead of a refund, and the credit wasn&#x27;t even for the full amount!!!  Not happy with this purchase experience at all.</li>
    <li> Definitely works but it doesn&#x27;t last all day like I was hoping.  I don&#x27;t like the smell of it at all.  But I do recommend it</li>
    <li> To tell you the truth I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in reducing the oil on my face. Doesn&#x27;t really seem to effectively prevent breakouts. Although it does seem to keep your face smooth and not dry. The pores on my face didn&#x27;t seem to reduce in size either. Guess this product didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, so there are a lot of products I can&#x27;t use. I mainly use the Clinique moisturizing gel, however recently, I&#x27;ve been getting really oily on my forehead and dry pretty much everywhere on my cheek and around my mouth. I think it&#x27;s because of the dry heat in Arizona that I&#x27;m not used to. I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 3 weeks now, and I can already feel the difference in my skin. My forehead is not oily at all anymore (even when I get hot), yet it has kept the rest of my skin moisturized all day. I use it after I shower and in the morning before I go to work. It stings a little after my shower (maybe because my pores are more open from the steam) but it may be that I&#x27;m a little bit products with sensitive to salicylic acid. Overall, great product and I highly recommend it for people with combination skin!</li>
    <li> The first few times using this product actually made the t zone area rough and dry. I did not see any improvement in pore sizes neither. It just made my skin around the nose area flakey and led to more red spots. Very disappointed.....</li>
    <li> My facialist recommended this product, and the results are wonderful.  Before I began using it, my pores (especially on and near my nose) would get congested and VERY visible to the naked eye.  I began using this on my t-zone the day after having a facial with extractions and my pores not only shrank, but failed to become congested again.  NO BLACKHEADS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A half-pump of the product covers my whole T-zone, so a little goes a long way, which makes the product more cost-effective than it may seem at first glance.  For me, there is a slight tingling sensation upon application, due to the exfoliating properties of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to a) people who have similar skin issues to those described above and b) people who have used and liked Murad products before. This product is great news for anyone who feels self-conscious about large pores and blackheads.</li>
    <li> This product was not for my face; with only one use, I had a serious face breakout that caused me to toss the bottle right away. Sorry, but products like this for a first time- need to be purchased directly at the store...</li>
    <li> After applying this to my face and dried, it was like a thin film covered it. maybe i put too much on but it didn&#x27;t feel light, rather heavy and sticky. It also made my face red. I didn&#x27;t notice anything beneficial about it. I don&#x27;t really have acne but i do have large pores so i was looking for an improvement in my pores which I didn&#x27;t see. I guess this could help with acne but I can&#x27;t say if it does or not.</li>
    <li> My wife first used this product at a salon and has been very pleased with the results.  Of course, the salon price was very high and my wife decided to shop around.  The product she received from the seller looked the same as what she bought from the salon and after using it for over 2 wks. she can&#x27;t tell difference in this bottle vs the bottle she bought from the salon.  The biggest difference was in my wallet having a few extra $$ in it.  Seller was very prompt with delivery also.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly to my door! I have had inconsistent results--but only due to my inconsistent use. Says to apply twice a day--I apply 1-2 times about every other day and have seen some results.</li>
    <li> Plastic container. Really bad smell. Could not use it.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing.  A bunch of claims but no results. I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Buy something else!</li>
    <li> I use this product after washing with the Pomegranate wash.  It protects my skin all day.  My skin has definitely improved using murad products.</li>
    <li> Xlnt! It is kind of thick and sticky, and it doesn&#x27;t smell all that great...but boy does it work on minimizing pores!! Just use it at night :)</li>
    <li> This serum is great. I have combination skin and it really helps control everything. I usually use it at night. It stings a little when putting it on, but only for a second. It helps keep my skin clear- better than other OTC face products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I haven&#x27;t noticed any progress. Maybe it&#x27;ll start to work eventually, though.</li>
    <li> I ordered twice this product from Amazon. I didn&#x27;t feel much difference by applying this solution to my face. It is not so useful to me.</li>
    <li> I needed a pore refiner and had been using a mask that was very messy.  I read the reviews on Murad and it really works!  Love this!  Easy to use, no odor, have been using it every day.</li>
    <li> This was like wet glue that never dried. It looked shiny and I think it even made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was horrible, just a piece of tape over the top.&lt;br /&gt;It was leaking but ebay never believes me so why bother.</li>
    <li> This formula is awesome! I use it all over my face and neck. My pores are visibly smaller and my skin is super smooth.  I&#x27;ve been using murad products since my early to mid 20&#x27;s and now at 43, I still get carded to buy wine.  If I cheat and use a friends product in order to support their &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; business, my skin suffers.  There has never been any product that works with my skin better than Murad. Their whole line gives your skin a beautiful glow.</li>
    <li> i have combination skin with an oily t zone. and all i can say is nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope. Dried me out and i was still breaking out. have since switched to dr.hauschka. Amazing!</li>
    <li> This product is so-so.  I like the other Reform products so I thought I would like this one.  It feels fine when I put it on but in combination with my oil reducer, moisturizer and make-up it feels like a lot of product on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought it and use it if I&#x27;m not going to wear make-up, but if I&#x27;m going in full warpaint, I don&#x27;t end up using it.</li>
    <li> Well I was buying this thinking it was going to dramatically change my black heads.&lt;br /&gt;infact it didn&#x27;t at all, yes my pores got smaller, but it made it harder to get my black heads out :(&lt;br /&gt;if you have perfect skin and just big pores then this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> The wife is made me buy this stuff several times now, she believes it really does what it says it does.  I don&#x27;t complain, she is easy to look at.</li>
    <li> So far this product is great to control my t-zone, I had used many products for this issue and finally this work.  I combined with Clean &amp; Clear oil control face wash and I get the results that I need. I don&#x27;t have to use my oil bloating face paper as often, only once a day.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Have been using it for over 10 years.  It has changed the texture of my skin and has also reduced fine lines and wrinkles!  Amazing!!</li>
