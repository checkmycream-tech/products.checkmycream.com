      <li>I practically got it for free!</li>

      <li>Easy turn to close.</li>
      <li>I had to wash the perfume from my neck and wrists because it was so strong in the car  </li>
      <li>Not overly strong or offending whatsoever.</li>
      <li>The original is much more unique that the Addict II scent.  </li>
      <li>great lasting power, and i always get compliments on it.</li>
      <li>I have been using this Fragrance exclusively for many years and it is always consistent.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance needs to be utilized on special occasions.</li>
      <li>Your phermones dictate how colognes are affected, (if you can&#x27;t smell it on you, it&#x27;s right for you!)</li>
      <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, she absolutely loves the scent and gets compliments all the time of what she is wearing.</li>
      <li>And for full retail price.</li>
      <li>What I received was a tester full size but a tester that would be used in store for customers to</li>
      <li>Great scent, but rich and not for your average jaunt about town.  </li>
      <li>The package was wrapped well, came quickly and undamaged, and was full.  </li>
      <li>i recommend that you do yourself a favor and buy it from a reputable perfume distributor such as sephora or a department store even if it costs a bit more.</li>
      <li>The more I wear this new bottle the more it seems to smell just like the last bottle that I know is authentic.</li>
      <li>I just received this large size Dior Addict to replace a smaller size that was almost gone &amp; came from a perfume store, so I&#x27;m sure it was authentic.</li>
      <li>I have loved a wide variety of perfumes from spicy to woody to floral .</li>
      <li>I love this perfume, but this bottle smelled old...</li>
      <li>pricing was right in line with everyone else&#x27;s.    </li>
      <li>Great perfume as usual from Dior.  </li>
      <li>Besides the richness of the fragrance , the lasting power is far better than most perfumes.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>EVERYONE wants to know what it is when I wear it!  </li>
      <li>A co-worker of mine sat next to me and all I could smell was a lovely scent.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should be aware of this as will Dior by end of day</li>
      <li>Same fabulous scent!</li>
      <li>Their are so many financial ramifications of where and how testers ate paid for,used as deductiions as cost of goods, ect ect ect</li>
      <li>Before purchase I didn&#x27;t know the product has twist of the top to open to spray the fragrance.</li>
      <li>I can say this for certain, IT SMELLS.</li>
      <li>im 99.9% certain that this was a knockoff, and it makes me not want to buy perfume from amazon ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Shiping was fast, on time.</li>
      <li>I am very upset with this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i had to throw the whole bottle away.</li>
      <li>very uncharacteristic for dior perfumes.</li>
      <li>But, for any women out there that wants to be set apart from the crowd of others, try this cologne.</li>
      <li>bought it for my wife and she like&#x27;s it too much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite perfume in the world!</li>
    <li> Your phermones dictate how colognes are affected, (if you can&#x27;t smell it on you, it&#x27;s right for you!); I found my gem. Not a moment, day, encounter goes by that a woman or man does not say to me \\&quot;gosh, you smell great!\\&quot; or \\&quot;I could just stand by you all day\\&quot;. I prefer NOT to tell them what I&#x27;m wearing for I do not want a lot of women in my area smelling this good. LOL!  But, for any women out there that wants to be set apart from the crowd of others, try this cologne. Seriously, what have you got to lose?  Merry, Monterey, CA.</li>
    <li> This product came with the cap broken, and spilled into the box.  The package seemed to be ok, and nothing looked bad outside.  I can´t explain how the cap broke.  The only explanation is that it came broken since dealer.</li>
    <li> Awesome fresh perfume😍. Scent of a goddess👼</li>
    <li> The perfume was ordered via expedited shipping in which I paid for it to be received in 2 or 3 days, however it did not ship for over 5 days so it took over a week to get it.  The seller however did apologize for the error.  As for the perfume, surely you are not reading this review to determine whether or not you should buy it???  I can say this for certain, IT SMELLS.</li>
    <li> I agree with these women!!  This fragrance is amazing.  I receive so many compliments!!!!  I am so surprised that you can only order the product online.&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness for Amazon and their wonderful service!!  Hey you will turn heads&lt;br /&gt;when you wear \\&quot;Addict\\&quot; you become one!!!</li>
    <li> Pricey, but my favorite scent for 20 years.  Not too &amp;#34;perfume-y&amp;#34; if used sparingly.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipment!</li>
    <li> I get compliments every time I wear this perfume, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long on me. Men like it alot, too.</li>
    <li> thanks it was a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my wife and she like&#x27;s it too much. Good job.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume</li>
    <li> Great scent, but rich and not for your average jaunt about town.  This fragrance needs to be utilized on special occasions. :-)&lt;br /&gt; I swear there are pheromones at work here!</li>
    <li> this is my very favorite fragrance. i&#x27;ve loved it for years.  the service was prompt and well-done. pricing was right in line with everyone else&#x27;s.    good job.</li>
    <li> I love the cologne. I&#x27;ve worn it for years. My only issue is when it was $20 cheaper I was told it couldn&#x27;t be shipped to my address or numerous others I tried. When I contacted customer service I was told it was a technical error that was in the process of being corrected. When problem wasn&#x27;t resolved I called again and got a different story. After the price went up suddenly it could be shipped to my address after all.</li>
    <li> Love that I didn&#x27;t have to run all over to find this fragrance for my niece.  She loves it and it is always difficult to find.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance almost 12 years, and I always get compliments on it.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere, so I&#x27;ve started buying it here.  Same fabulous scent!</li>
    <li> Very strong perfume!  I had to wash the perfume from my neck and wrists because it was so strong in the car  it made my boyfriend and myself nauseas.  I&#x27;ll stick to my &amp;#34;David Yurman&amp;#34;.  Sorry, not for me!</li>
    <li> this is not the first time ive had weird experiences (on amazon) with perfumes i know and love. the packaging and labeling of this bottle was different from that of the bottles ive purchased from sephora or department stores. the spray nozzle broke after a week or two. the sillage of the perfume was terrible, and it even seemed a bit watered down. very uncharacteristic for dior perfumes. im 99.9% certain that this was a knockoff, and it makes me not want to buy perfume from amazon ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for the perfume itself (when purchased from a legit source), its an amazing scent. deep, mysterious, even powdery sometimes. great lasting power, and i always get compliments on it. i recommend that you do yourself a favor and buy it from a reputable perfume distributor such as sephora or a department store even if it costs a bit more.</li>
    <li> It is for my wife. When I bought this, she is not my wife, just a girl friend.&lt;br /&gt;But now she became my wife through this products.</li>
    <li> Fabulous - love this scent</li>
    <li> this is not Dior Addict. Do not purchase</li>
    <li> Product is great, even better for the price.&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite perfume however there are times when I can&#x27;t afford it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This is the only scent I&#x27;ve worn for ages.  It&#x27;s getting hard to find in stores.  The package was wrapped well, came quickly and undamaged, and was full.  Glad to find it online and will get a couple more.</li>
    <li> I wear it even picking Blackberries!  It&#x27;s ALWAYS time for Dior!!  Addict-- the one to wear with everything!  ( No! Not going there.--too predictable.  The price could be better.  Well, I could go on..and on.. however, I think we&#x27;d all be happier if I just went on!</li>
    <li> I love it. I have used before and had other perfumes but I had to stick with Dior as I had received so many compliments. Shiping was fast, on time.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years.  I thought I was getting a good deal compared to the department stores, but I think I got a fugazi.  It is definitely not the same fragrance.  In fact, it may be just water.  No one, including myself, can smell it.  I think Amazon needs to monitor their vendors more closely.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  I wear it daytime and at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years. Lots of compliments. I was so pleased that I could use my reward points when purchasing. I practically got it for free!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. The package was badly damaged by the shipper but the product was fine.</li>
    <li> Love this colone and the price.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely as always...authentic scent</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, but this bottle smelled old...</li>
    <li> I have been using this Fragrance exclusively for many years and it is always consistent.  It takes very little to last all day so a bottle this size will last me almost a year!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, she absolutely loves the scent and gets compliments all the time of what she is wearing.</li>
    <li> I shopped around and this was the lowest price that I found. This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume and she was very happy with this gift Christmas morning</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife. Her favorite. Good scent.</li>
    <li> I just received this large size Dior Addict to replace a smaller size that was almost gone &amp; came from a perfume store, so I&#x27;m sure it was authentic. I compared the two having been warned by the prominent negative review that this Dior is fake (Amazon is very brave to leave that review at the top). At first I noticed a difference in the scent but now as I compare them further I do not. It may be that my body is processing the new bottle the same now. I think there can be a small difference in scent because like baking a cake, the recipe can be identical &amp; change a little from one mixing to the next. The new perfume hits your skin &amp; is heated by your body temp &amp; a new bottle can react a little differently till your body starts processing it the same way as the last bottle. The more I wear this new bottle the more it seems to smell just like the last bottle that I know is authentic. So far I am trusting this product &amp; I saved $12 buying it from Amazon. My only criticism is how long it took to arrive which was probably within the time promised, I didn&#x27;t keep track, but it seemed I waited so long.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and I love it on her. Incredible fragrance.</li>
    <li> Incredibly well packaged for shipment.  A gorgeous scent in a gorgeous atomizer!</li>
    <li> I was completely ripped off. Product was nothing like what the actual brand produces. Such a waste of money and not at all a smooth transaction. Completely unhappy. Wouldn&#x27;t even give it 1 star..</li>
    <li> Heavy, heavy, and heady fragrance with a sickening sweetness.  I sold Dior when this fragrance launched to a very sexy ad.  Dior makes some nice fragrances, but this is not one of them.  It just screams, &amp;#34;French Whore.&amp;#34;  Amazed at the good reviews.  If you hate Dior&#x27;s Poison, you&#x27;ll hate this one, too.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had dior addict perfume before and this seemed off. the first spray had a very bad lingering scent that was harsh. i had to throw the whole bottle away. i was so disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the third time to reorder this product.  My wife loves it, therefore I love it.  Works well with her body chemistry.  Not overly strong or offending whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Great perfume as usual from Dior.  I have used midnight blue and other Dior perfume and this is satisfying as always.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by it and has been using it for some 5 years now. This is the only perfume she uses on a daily basis and pretty much skips all the others she have (really, she should be writing this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - expensive at $100 for 3.4 and is never on sale.</li>
    <li> Before purchase I didn&#x27;t know the product has twist of the top to open to spray the fragrance. Easy turn to close. No more searching for the top of the bottle to close it,  or thinking its going to vaporize by the spray \\&quot; nozzel\\&quot;  not being closed/covered. I like the  lines of the midnight blue bottle, you can&#x27;t see the spray tip, its inside,  it doesn&#x27;t get touched so no breaking it, that&#x27;s  a plus ! And easy to pack for travel because its a rectagular shape glass container.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the dark glass, exposure to light(s) are not going to change the scent.Its \\&quot;original\\&quot; every time I use it, same enchanting fragrance each time, never old, never stale. People comment on how unique, pleasing &amp; mysterious a scent it is.I love it!</li>
    <li> I came to Amazon to purchase my fragrance Dior Addict.&lt;br /&gt;3.4 oz 90.00. What I received was a tester full size but a tester that would be used in store for customers to try.&lt;br /&gt;  I paid 90.00 for collateral product. I am very upset with this.&lt;br /&gt;My career of 30 yrs was spent in the cosmetics industry. I am sure that Dior will be very unhappy when I tell them about this. Who has authorized you to sell their fragrance testers? And for full retail price. Their are so many financial ramifications of where and how testers ate paid for,used as deductiions as cost of goods, ect ect ect&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should be aware of this as will Dior by end of day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for over 10 yrs and strangers still stop me to tell me how wonderful I smell and ask about this perfume.  The original is much more unique that the Addict II scent.  One application lasts all day.</li>
    <li> The first perfume both me and my husband love! I get tons of compliments from other men who like this too!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  Everytime I wear this fragrance a stranger will always stop me and compliment me on my perfume or the lovely fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> What can one say about Diors Addict.  It&#x27;s by far the nicest perfume on the market!  EVERYONE wants to know what it is when I wear it!  I wouldn&#x27;t wear anything else!</li>
    <li> I love this scent in the stores. And it is definitely the same one - but the one that came from amazon smells &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; like it has gotten stale or started to go rancid.  I feel like I smell like a patchouli&#x27;d hippy if I wear it:(. Wish I would have paid the extra 20 and bought it from the dept store.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this never a problem</li>
    <li> I am a fragrance junkie ! I have loved a wide variety of perfumes from spicy to woody to floral . This one is unusual and the name \\&quot;addict \\&quot; is fitting because it is hard to stop sniffing oneself because of the richness of the fragrance . It is a different perfume because it is floral and gourmand . At times a rich heady floral is obvious , then a few minutes later a rich vanilla can be observed . The depth and intensity of this makes it stand out from all others I have ever owned. Besides the richness of the fragrance , the lasting power is far better than most perfumes. I would say this is in a class of its own .Once you spray it and  walk away , you can not forget it . Warm, rich , sexy , and elegant . I can not imagine anyone not being mesmerized by \\&quot;ADDICT \\&quot; .</li>
    <li> I  purchased  the 3.4 Ounce EDP Spray Dior Addict for a friend. I had looked for it The price was good and and the bottle reached me in good condition and NEW.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in perfect packaging. My daughter loves it. Good value and a good buy. The real thing, definitely</li>
    <li> A co-worker of mine sat next to me and all I could smell was a lovely scent. I asked her what she was wearing and she blessed me with this as the answer...&amp;#34;Dior Addict!&amp;#34; Macy&#x27;s and Nordies carry it, even HSN but not at this price. I just sprayed it on my sheets and it&#x27;s dreamy. Love it! Classic and Sexy.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The silver top came off! I called Amazon and they gave me an adjustment on the spot! I smell so yummy, I love it!</li>
