      <li>I have been using Maybelline Sky High Curves mascara for quite a while.  </li>
      <li>I was so upset when I could no longer find Sky High Curves at ANY store.  </li>
      <li>But, Mabelline sky high curves does both.  </li>
      <li>So, needless to say I was happy when I found it on Amason&#x27;s website.  </li>
      <li>So, it is dryer than it would have been if it was made new.</li>

      <li>Even though the packages were still intact and sealed, the mascara was old and flaky.  </li>

      <li>No longer use it because it is not cruelty free :/</li>
      <li>When the product arrived I was surprised to find individual tubes in a plastic bag</li>
      <li>They just don&#x27;t last as long as new mascara.</li>
      <li>After trying several other products and NOT liking any of them, I went on line and thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m late writing this review but it shipped quick</li>
      <li>I recently unsealed one only to find the new tube was almost as dried out as the old one I&#x27;d been using for several weeks.  </li>

<li> Unlike it&#x27;s waterproof counterpart, this mascara drags my lashes straight down (after I spent time using an eyelash curler).  </li>
<li> I hope you carry this mascara for a long time.</li>

<li> The mascara was dry, the packaging looked faded.</li>
<li> I have been looking for this mascara forever and was unable to find it in the U.S.  Thanks!!</li>
<li> Alot of other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried, do one or the other.  </li>
<li> It lengthens and gently curves your lashes without looking heavy or fake.  </li>
<li> They were both totally dried out.  </li>
<li> I bought quite a few and will use them up.</li>
<li> It lasts forever and even though it&#x27;s not waterporoof, it stays on even in the rain or if you&#x27;ve been crying.  </li>
<li> totally dried out after I unwrapped them.  </li>
<li> It was a real waste of money.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad there has to be dishonest sellers out there.  </li>
<li> They make it difficult to find</li>
<li> Sorry they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
<li> Unable to even use.</li>
<li> When I recieved this order..most of the product packaging was either dirty or opened...</li>
<li> I am very disappointed.</li>

    <li> I love this mascara! I have used it for years until it was dicontinued. I was VERY happy to see it was still available (for now) on Amazon. The transaction was smooth, the 3 tubes i bought arrived quickly and all were new in original packaging. Probably best not to try this mascara if you haven&#x27;t already because you will love it and then be disappointed when it is all gone!</li>
    <li> When I recieved this order..most of the product packaging was either dirty or opened...I felt like I couldnt use it. Threw in garbage....</li>
    <li> I recently bought Maybelline Sky High Mascara from Bellagio and they were all defective...totally dried out after I unwrapped them.  I will not buy from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used! It never clumps and washes off with just soap and water. It lasts forever and even though it&#x27;s not waterporoof, it stays on even in the rain or if you&#x27;ve been crying.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found and they don&#x27;t even sell it in the stores anymore, so you have to order it online!!</li>
    <li> I was so upset when I could no longer find Sky High Curves at ANY store.  I then went on \\&quot;the hunt\\&quot;; you know the one when they stop producing your favorite bra or makeup (WHY do they do that!).  I went through 4 different types and didn&#x27;t like any.  Then I \\&quot;googled\\&quot; it and here it was.  I ordered 5 or 6 of them; I should have ordered them all.  I hope I can still get it when these are done.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara and I can&#x27;t believe they discontinued it. It tightened up for just enough curl on my lashes and never left me with mascara marks on my eyelids. Thanks Amazon &amp; beauty savings for having it! :)</li>
    <li> I wish Maybelline continued this mascara.  It lengthens and gently curves your lashes without looking heavy or fake.  People would always comment on my lashes (not my mascara).  The reason for the 3 stars is that this mascara is what it is, mascara that was made some time ago. So, it is dryer than it would have been if it was made new. The seller (Beauty Savings) I bought it from was wonderful though.  They were very quick to respond to questions I emailed them. I bought quite a few and will use them up. They just don&#x27;t last as long as new mascara.</li>
    <li> Since it was discontinued in stores, I was happy to find the mascara available.  When the product arrived I was surprised to find individual tubes in a plastic bag but the tubes were sealed so I thought it would be fine.  I recently unsealed one only to find the new tube was almost as dried out as the old one I&#x27;d been using for several weeks.  I haven&#x27;t tried the others I ordered to see if they&#x27;re all that way.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using Maybelline Sky High Curves mascara for quite a while.  I like it alot because it gives my lashes volume as well as length.  Alot of other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried, do one or the other.  But, Mabelline sky high curves does both.  When I needed to purchase more, I could&#x27;nt find it at my local retailer.  My husband suggested I check the internet.  So, needless to say I was happy when I found it on Amason&#x27;s website.  I really like this mascara and when I need to purchase another supply I will definately order from amazon.        Thank you,  GDB-Ohio</li>
    <li> I recently purchsed 2 of the Maybeline Sky High Mascaras.  They were both totally dried out.  Will not buy from Bellagio again.  It&#x27;s too bad there has to be dishonest sellers out there.  It makes it bad for those who are honest and try to sell good products.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara.  I use two mascaras every day. This one I use to prime my eyelashes because it never clumps and it seperates and lengthens them.  Maybelline has stopped stocking them in stores and I have looked and looked for it.  After trying several other products and NOT liking any of them, I went on line and thanks to Amazon I was able to buy several tubes.  Thank you, Amazon.  I hope you carry this mascara for a long time.</li>
    <li> I should&#x27;ve gotten the water proof one.  It&#x27;s always been my favorite though.  Good value for the money.  Sorry they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
    <li> These must have been sitting around someone &#x27;s basement for a while before they sent them out. It lasted about a week. The mascara was dry, the packaging looked faded. If they&#x27; re discontinued, they&#x27;re discontinued.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because -- I believed -- it was an incredible price for my favorite product.  Even though the packages were still intact and sealed, the mascara was old and flaky.  Completely unusable. I didn&#x27;t consider it a huge loss, as I paid only $1.86 per unit...however, I purchased six units, and they were all unusable.  It was a real waste of money.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara just wish I could see it actually curl my lashes.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase! Ordered 2 mascaras which were both old and dried. Unable to even use. Very disapointed with product.</li>
    <li> My wife only uses this mascara, and we couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores anymore. It was always sold out. We found it at Amazon, and it was cheaper there than it was at the store. Nice!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why Maybelline wants to change things - I firmly believe if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.  They make it difficult to find but I do find some HERE and that is where I buy it from.  So far, successful and I&#x27;ll hate to see the day it is no longer available.</li>
    <li> Unlike it&#x27;s waterproof counterpart, this mascara drags my lashes straight down (after I spent time using an eyelash curler).  It was a mistake to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best mascara ever! Just a shame Maybelline quit making it!</li>
    <li> this product was discontinued in my local store.  I was tickled pink when I found this mascara on-line because it is the best mascara Maybelline has ever made.  I now buy 2 tubes at a time, so I have a spare, just In case.</li>
    <li> really liked this product. Good delivery time. No longer use it because it is not cruelty free :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m late writing this review but it shipped quick and I was very pleased.  I have been looking for this mascara forever and was unable to find it in the U.S.  Thanks!!</li>
