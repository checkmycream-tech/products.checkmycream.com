      <li>For incredible hair rejuvenation power I prefer Rahua products instead .</li>
      <li>My hair has never looked so good!  </li>
      <li>My daughter has tried EVERY thing, so I am happy to take her advice.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>This product was very nice.</li>
      <li>smell great and have good texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s good for you.</li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>The product is excellent, both the shampoo and contidionair totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>Smells good and makes your hair silky when rinsing, but didn&#x27;t reduce frizz when drying as well as I would&#x27;ve liked.  </li>
      <li>And I really love them!  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Gentle and perfect for oil control</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair like silk and untangled, It is very light and leaves no residue I love it and will continue to use!</li>
      <li>tried the Davines Love shampoo and conditioner because I&#x27;ve tried so many Davines products to date and loved them.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I love just about all of their hair products.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>they look adorable in my shower.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>If you have curly, frizzy hair you will love this product.</li>
      <li>Smells yummy and love the results.</li>
      <li>The Love formula smooths my hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo makes my hair so much more moisturized and silky.</li>
      <li>Ok, So I love this brand and all their products.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair nice, smooth and tangle-free.</li>
      <li>It smells lovely too.</li>
      <li>But they work better together.</li>
      <li>That said, I give the advantage to the Oi shampoo and conditioner because I find it to be even more hydrating, which my extra-dry hair needs.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>favorite smell and smooth results</li>
      <li>I have healthy full hair</li>
      <li>Still, I think it is a really great set and much more hydrating than most other shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried and am giving it five stars for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And then I style with the Deva Curl Styling Cream and Deva Curl light defining gel.  </li>
      <li>It was great to purchase it as a set instead of individually.</li>
      <li>The duo keeps my hair smooth yet bouncy.  </li>
      <li>They are quite moisturizing and using them in conduction with the aforementioned Davines styling products, my hair looked very healthy and smooth and styled easily.  </li>
      <li>One Condition to clean and condition my hair.  </li>
      <li>It rinsed clean.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that these products are anything special.</li>
      <li>i love this shampoo and have orderered it many times but this last time i got it</li>
      <li>It takes a really good shampoo and conditioner to overcome all of that, along with naturally dry curls.  </li>
      <li>great hair product, left hair really soft and it lasted a long time, i&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good product</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and supple and the curls are better.</li>
      <li>However, once I opened them the wrap was no longer useful.  </li>
      <li>The smell is really nice but not fruity and lasts through to the next shampoo.</li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo I have used it in the past.  </li>
      <li>For awhile I wasn&#x27;t convinced salon brands were really worth the money until I found the exact products that worked for me, cut back on how often I washed and heat styled my hair, and had my hair cut more often.  </li>
      <li>Love Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner are now purple in color, and come in a slightly different container.  </li>
      <li>I do love Davines&#x27; Modeling Putty, it&#x27;s terrific for molding waves and curls without giving your hair a sticky texture and offensive aroma.</li>
      <li>Overall, love the product - thank you Davines.</li>
      <li>I hope it is just simply a mistake. :)</li>
      <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased Davines Love.</li>
      <li>Only critique is that I wish the conditioner container was better suited for travel, as I don&#x27;t trust that the lid will stay on during the toss around baggage handling.  </li>
      <li>Does everything it says- smooths and conditions, even in this hot summer &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; weather.  </li>
      <li>Made my hair soft and silky smooth.</li>
      <li>They smell good, they tame fizzes, they seem to hydrate my hair.  </li>
      <li>On the days I wear my hair straight, I shampoo &amp; condition with either Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Blonde Angel products (to help my hair from becoming too brassy) or Davines Oi products.  </li>
      <li>It also has a slight grapefruit-like smell that smelled really fresh and appealing.  </li>
      <li>Expected more than this given the price tag.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d consider it better than average, but a bit overpriced.</li>
      <li>but if this is how they are going to sell it and pay full price for half a bottle i will quit using it, sure there are other shampoos out there worth it.</li>
      <li>Oddly, the very simple plastic containers were the first thing I liked about this product when my nurse practitioner, allergy-prone hair-loving daughter bought them in San Francisco.  </li>
      <li>You only need a tiny amount, so don&#x27;t let the price fool you because it&#x27;s actually very economical.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product, especially for frizzy, hard to tame hair!  </li>
      <li>I received a large size sample of each of the shampoo and conditioner recently.  </li>
      <li>leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m a major fan!</li>
      <li>(Enjoy Hair and Body Treatment Oil) and also a tiny bit of a finishing product (Redken Outshine) but these products haven&#x27;t given me these same results with other shampoo and conditioner!</li>
      <li>my hair is fine but thick</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is my general regime.</li>
      <li>They are gentle on the locks, but have a minimal effect on frizz or curls.</li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s hair is a little bit different and we all have different preferences when it comes to styling so for me there was no substitute for experimenting and figuring out what worked with my unique hair needs.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s what works well for me and many of them I use so little of (especially the styling products) that they last me a long, long</li>
      <li>It is highlighted blonde, somewhat coarse, and naturally wavy.  </li>
      <li>For me, my biggest hair issue is keeping it soft and shiny, especially since I regularly heat style and highlight my hair.  </li>
      <li>However, if your hair is less prone to dryness and less problematic than mine, you might fine this to be sufficient.  </li>
      <li>I have very dry hair and its been through colorings, high and low lights, blow dryer and flattening irons.  </li>
      <li>Sound dumb?  </li>
      <li>it was half full!!!!!!!!!!!for the price i expect a full bottle it is not worth the hassle of shipping back and waiting but am waiting to see what the company does.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> FYI the packaging and color have recently changed.  Love Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner are now purple in color, and come in a slightly different container.  I thought I received the wrong product, but after a little research I found it to be exactly the same as the pink.</li>
    <li> I received a large size sample of each of the shampoo and conditioner recently.  Both days i used the samples, I received multiple compliments on my hair--along the lines of &amp;#34;you&#x27;ve got the best hair I&#x27;ve ever seen&amp;#34;.  One day it was even pouring down rain.  The duo keeps my hair smooth yet bouncy.  Love it.  Do want to say that I also use an oil in the ends before I dry it (Enjoy Hair and Body Treatment Oil) and also a tiny bit of a finishing product (Redken Outshine) but these products haven&#x27;t given me these same results with other shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo I have used it in the past.  My only complaint was the bottom of the conditioner container was cracked which could of happened during shipping.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that these products are anything special. They are gentle on the locks, but have a minimal effect on frizz or curls. For incredible hair rejuvenation power I prefer Rahua products instead . I do love Davines&#x27; Modeling Putty, it&#x27;s terrific for molding waves and curls without giving your hair a sticky texture and offensive aroma.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s used in my salon. Love it. You only need a tiny amount, so don&#x27;t let the price fool you because it&#x27;s actually very economical.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff</li>
    <li> Big disappointment. Poor packaging. Half of the conditioner leaked out during shipment. Sent it all back. Was looking forward to trying the product. Apparently seller does not have enough respect for the product to ship it with some protection in a hard pack. Expected more than this given the price tag.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair like silk and untangled, It is very light and leaves no residue I love it and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BOMB!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It changed my hair dramatically! I love this. I am a hairdresser and still would pay the price for this. Well worth it. Really best to use both.  I tried to use the conditioner only. But they work better together. But he conditioner is the best .</li>
    <li> Oddly, the very simple plastic containers were the first thing I liked about this product when my nurse practitioner, allergy-prone hair-loving daughter bought them in San Francisco.  They smell good, they tame fizzes, they seem to hydrate my hair.  My daughter has tried EVERY thing, so I am happy to take her advice.&lt;br /&gt;And they look adorable in my shower.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased Davines Love. It was great to purchase it as a set instead of individually. My hair loves this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product was very nice. It gave me smoothness, not to mention it smelled great! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Have used this line for years. Smells yummy and love the results. The Love formula smooths my hair. I have healthy full hair</li>
    <li> i love this shampoo and have orderered it many times but this last time i got it it was half full!!!!!!!!!!!for the price i expect a full bottle it is not worth the hassle of shipping back and waiting but am waiting to see what the company does.  I have used and ordered this shampoo and the conditioner for years but if this is how they are going to sell it and pay full price for half a bottle i will quit using it, sure there are other shampoos out there worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It came in my Birch Box. It is smoothing but not too heavy. my hair is fine but thick and I keep it colored and highlighted so it tends to frizz in humidity and this definitely keeps it silky. The smell is really nice but not fruity and lasts through to the next shampoo.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, especially for frizzy, hard to tame hair!  Cracked square container of Conditioner arrived leaking, but somewhat usable amount of product left in container.</li>
    <li> Made my hair soft and silky smooth. Also did the same for my daughter&#x27;s course wavy hair. Really Great products!</li>
    <li> I got the coarsest grade of hair there is. This product made my hair feel like silk. It rinsed clean. I am African-American with hair that must have moisture. This shampoo did it! I am searching for the Ph balance since my hair chemically trea. I hope I can use this Shampoo for years to come. It smells lovely too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have very dry hair and its been through colorings, high and low lights, blow dryer and flattening irons.  This shampoo makes my hair so much more moisturized and silky.</li>
    <li> The Tub cracked and product was all over package. I did not request refund as I didnt want to pay to return the items.  Sound dumb?  Well, it does but it was understandable at the time.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, which often gets dry and frizzy.  My daughter recommended I try this product, which was recommended by her stylist.  LOVE IT. My hair feels soft and supple and the curls are better. Only critique is that I wish the conditioner container was better suited for travel, as I don&#x27;t trust that the lid will stay on during the toss around baggage handling.  I did take the containers with me and used press and seal wrap around them and placed them in a zip lock bag.  However, once I opened them the wrap was no longer useful.  The product is too expensive to loose any.      Back to how this product works.  We have well water with lots of minerals and no water softener.  It is brutal on my hair.  It takes a really good shampoo and conditioner to overcome all of that, along with naturally dry curls.  Overall, love the product - thank you Davines.</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked so good!  This is extra concentrated so a very little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> If you have curly, frizzy hair you will love this product. Combine it with the Oil product and you will have the best looking hair you have ever had.</li>
    <li> One of the best. It keeps my hair nice, smooth and tangle-free. It SMELLS GREAT too!!</li>
    <li> After lots and lots of research, I decided to give this stuff a try, wish I would have happened upon a sample. The smell was awful. A lot of reviewers mentioned &amp;#34;grapefruit&amp;#34;, but I absolutely disliked it. Typically, I have soft, maneageable, curly, sometimes frizzy hair. This stuff made my hair super tangly and hard to brush through, and left a strange residue on my hair. Overall, extremely dissatisfied with the product. Back to Mane &#x27;n Tail for me.</li>
    <li> I love just about all of their hair products. It is the only company that knows curly hair and how to care for it. This stuff is amazing and you will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> favorite smell and smooth results, I&#x27;m a major fan! you news just a little of both the shampoo and conditioner so these are lasting in small sizes</li>
    <li> Smells good and makes your hair silky when rinsing, but didn&#x27;t reduce frizz when drying as well as I would&#x27;ve liked.  I&#x27;d consider it better than average, but a bit overpriced.</li>
    <li> Ok, So I love this brand and all their products.&lt;br /&gt;They smell great and have good texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT&lt;br /&gt;the seller is listing the product with wrong size.&lt;br /&gt;The products that I received were &amp;#34;sampler size&amp;#34; both 2.5oz not 8.45 as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;For the prices of almost $40.00 it is simply not worth it. I hope it is just simply a mistake. :)</li>
    <li> One of the best shampoo and conditioners for curly/straight hair. It smells wonderful. Leaves hair silky. only negative is the price.</li>
    <li> For context, I have thick, shoulder length hair.  It is highlighted blonde, somewhat coarse, and naturally wavy.  For me, my biggest hair issue is keeping it soft and shiny, especially since I regularly heat style and highlight my hair.  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried all manners of shampoo from affordable drug store brands to a variety of salon brands.  For awhile I wasn&#x27;t convinced salon brands were really worth the money until I found the exact products that worked for me, cut back on how often I washed and heat styled my hair, and had my hair cut more often.  I say that because based on my experience, no one thing is a miracle cure and it wasn&#x27;t until I did all these things that I&#x27;ve had the softest, healthiest hair I&#x27;ve ever had in my entire life.  That doesn&#x27;t mean it is flawless or that I don&#x27;t have bad hair days (I do!), it just is noticeably healthier than it&#x27;s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my general regime. On the days I wear my hair straight, I shampoo &amp; condition with either Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Blonde Angel products (to help my hair from becoming too brassy) or Davines Oi products.  Then I style with a combination of Davines This is a Relaxing Moisturizing Fluid and OI/Absolute Beautifying Potion while using my hair dryer and flat iron.  On the days I wear my hair curly, I use Deva Curl No Poo and Deva Curl One Condition to clean and condition my hair.  And then I style with the Deva Curl Styling Cream and Deva Curl light defining gel.  Yes, it&#x27;s a lot of products but it&#x27;s what works well for me and many of them I use so little of (especially the styling products) that they last me a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Davines Love shampoo and conditioner because I&#x27;ve tried so many Davines products to date and loved them.  I was curious to see how these would compare to the others I&#x27;ve tried.  And I really love them!  They are quite moisturizing and using them in conduction with the aforementioned Davines styling products, my hair looked very healthy and smooth and styled easily.  It also has a slight grapefruit-like smell that smelled really fresh and appealing.  That said, I give the advantage to the Oi shampoo and conditioner because I find it to be even more hydrating, which my extra-dry hair needs.  However, if your hair is less prone to dryness and less problematic than mine, you might fine this to be sufficient.  Still, I think it is a really great set and much more hydrating than most other shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried and am giving it five stars for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately though, I think it comes down to what your individual needs.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is a little bit different and we all have different preferences when it comes to styling so for me there was no substitute for experimenting and figuring out what worked with my unique hair needs.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent, both the shampoo and contidionair totally worth the price. The reason for the three stars is because it was shipped in an envelope... Yes, an envelope and of course the conditionair&#x27;s container cracked!... Good thing I had an empty container...</li>
    <li> Does everything it says- smooths and conditions, even in this hot summer &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; weather.  And the smell is heavenly!  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Gentle and perfect for oil control</li>
    <li> great hair product, left hair really soft and it lasted a long time, i&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good product</li>
    <li> This is my everyday shampoo and conditioner. leaves my hair soft and shiny. Smells wonderful and it&#x27;s good for you.</li>
