<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love Clubman products and thought I would give this scent a try. I like it, but my favorite is still the original scent. This is a mild scent and wears off fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Classic gentleman smell. Excellent after shave</li>
    <li> Very light scent; nice for summer. I don&#x27;t get &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; out of the scent (perhaps my nose is just off), but it is pleasant none-the-less.</li>
    <li> I was running out of regular Clubman &amp;#34;which I love&amp;#34; and replenished by buying the Vanilla and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I really don&#x27;t smell any vanilla in it at all just a more subtle refined barbershop scent as compared to the original.  It&#x27;s a nice clean masculine scent on which I&#x27;ve received many compliments.  If you like Clubman, you&#x27;ll be very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> I used the Clubman Pinaud Classic Vanilla After Shave years ago and it maybe a bit old fashion but it still is light and not over powering.  I really enjoy using this after every shave.</li>
    <li> burns in a good way, heals nicks, sweet strong manly smell that lasts all day. great value</li>
    <li> I was quite surprised by the lack of pungency that I and others often associate with Pinaud aftershaves. I have been using the Pinaud Clubman Aftershave for a while now and have become accustomed to the immediate punch-in-the-face smell, and the nice and attenuated scent within 10-15 minutes after application. The Vanilla after shave is much more subtle. It needs a little more vanilla and less rotten egg hint, but overall, this has been well received by several women these passed months. So after a performance-based study, I have increased by initial review from 3 stars to 4. With that said, I have only ordered one of these, so I could have just received a bad batch and this could actually be the greatest scent available for under $10. Cheers, gentlemen.</li>
    <li> This is better used as a cologne for me because i have very dry skin, but i love the smell of gentlemanly vanilla.</li>
    <li> This stuff is one of the greatest aftershaves around.  You can&#x27;t find it in the drugstores.  The scent is wonderful, and other than a very slightly more-than-normal alcohol burn, it&#x27;s excellent.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this! Great for any occassion, formal or informal, day or evening.</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for. Shipping was super fast</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> this stuff makes shaving fun!  Burns a little at first, helps with nicks and drys in very quickly.  Leaves your face feeling soft and smooth.  The smell is great, manly but milder and it goes away after awhile and won&#x27;t clash with colognes.</li>
    <li> Your lady will also..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell like a man should smell..&lt;br /&gt;The alcohol tingles a little bit. Doesn&#x27;t burn like I&#x27;ve seen a few say this stuff burns.. Guess what.. It doesn&#x27;t. What in the world are you &amp;#34;Guys&amp;#34; thinking? Did you hurriedly hack your face up and apply this and blame the lotion for your lack of skill and devotion to the chore?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives you a nice clean feeling and a gentle tingling sensation when applied to a properly shaved face.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells great. My wife likes it too (on me, not her). Feels good to slap on after a close safety-razor shave. A bargain.</li>
    <li> Love Pinaud Products but this Classic Vanilla is not a Lotion but a Liquid After Shave; it&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;low on the Vanilla Scent&amp;#34;; Thus Just OK</li>
    <li> Another favorite from Pinaud. I think I like this slightly better than the classic Clubman, though its very close, they are both greatl. On the whole I would recommend this one first though. Why? The Regular Clubman is a bit more of an acquired taste. I had to wear it for a few days before I was a huge fan. This one was love at first smell. Also its a big gentler on the face. I like regular Clubman fine in that regard as well, but my skin is also on the oily side, this would probably be a bit easier on your face if you have drier skin than I do. This is as gentle as alcohol based aftershave gets, at least in my experience. The smell is also a winner imo, and almost impossible to dislike. Its sweet, rich, and sophisticated, without being the least bit girly, which is the reason why so many reviews use the word &amp;#34;gentleman&amp;#34; to describe it. Even though many of the scent ingredients are the same, this does not smell much like the Original Clubman. Original Clubman is more assertive. If I accidentally over-apply the original I feel a bit like a citronella candle. This one is sweeter and subtler. Before I tried it, I was slightly skeptical about this scent because I was afraid it would be one of those &amp;#34;gourmond&amp;#34; scents but its not. Vanilla is a common &amp;#34;bass note&amp;#34; in perfume, cologne, ect so the vanilla aspect makes this stuff smell sweet and last, but does not make you smell like a cake or cookie. The other major scents according to Pinaud are Lavender, Jasmine, Sage, and &amp;#34;spices&amp;#34;. The effect I get is a subtle, complex, pleasant sweetness, that is easy to notice, yet never overpowering (I can&#x27;t pick out any of the individual ingredients listed though). Like the original, the Vanilla Clubman lends itself well to double duty as a cologne as well if you splash a bit on your arms, neck, and maybe your chest. Also although this is a fairly subtle scent it has good staying power, it easily lasts all day. All for, around $1 an ounce its impossibleto go wrong with this stuff. I am a fan of the Original Clubman as well, but my advice is to try this one first. I think its easier to appreciate and will probably appeal to more people. Ultimately I&#x27;d say to try them both though, just try the original second.</li>
    <li> This Classic smell is great, soft and not overwhelming. Vanilla scent? Not really, it is very soft and when its dry and been on your face for a few minutes the scent gets softer as it goes.</li>
    <li> Very strong, a little dad will do ya. Smells great and the ladies love it!</li>
    <li> Nice mild smell. The vanilla smell is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to introduce my sons to more classic, &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; fragrances. This had the scent I remember my grandfather, father and I using.&lt;br /&gt;A timeless classic.</li>
    <li> Smells like formaldehyde and a pinch of vanilla. After applying you feel like you just had a hot shave from the barber shop.</li>
    <li> Another great product by clubman. I am a huge fan of all there products. The scent is not overpowering and last a really long time. Yep it burns but I like it.</li>
    <li> A nice classic scent for men. The vanilla is ver subdued and combined with a hint of musk. The alcohol is pretty overwhelming, so plan on airing out for 20 minutes or more before you want her to smell you.</li>
    <li> Here again is another favorite, classic vanilla is to me more of a floral scent but not, can I say this &amp;#34;girly.&amp;#34;It&#x27;s not heavy or loud,a softer type I think will be popular with many.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son. He didn&#x27;t like it, smells cheap. You would think it hard to go wrong with vanilla.</li>
    <li> Slight burn that goes away after just a couple seconds, leaving your face soothed. Scent is one that I think an older man would like more (I&#x27;m 30), but it&#x27;s still nice and isn&#x27;t overwhelming after it dries.</li>
    <li> Great smell, it&#x27;s a smoky musk type smell that is slightly sweet aftersmell.  Can&#x27;t beat the price for how much you get.  It is alcohol based, so it burns a bit after shaving, but it&#x27;s more of a love slap get you going kind of burn, not a sit down and shut up slap kind of burn.  I use this a couple times a day actually because it does a good job of moisturizing too, and it keeps my face from drying out in this cold dry winter air.</li>
    <li> My husband fell in love with this scent, not too vanilla, just right.</li>
    <li> Smells good! Doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Excellent scent, great value makes you feel great. would recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but I&#x27;ve had a few girls mention how strong the smell was, even after 6 hours.    +Price  +Long lasting  +Pleasant smell (to me and a few other people)      -- Love or hate kind of scent</li>
    <li> Gift for my boyfriend. Smells a lot better on than in the bottle. Stays on all day!! Good gift!:)</li>
    <li> This a GREAT aftershave lotion. Its scent is &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; and long-lasting, without being over-powering. It lingers on my hands and I find myself smelling my hand(s) during the day, for the pleasure of the experience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely not vanilla, but it does smell similarly to scents that women tend to like albeit w a musky men scent overtone at the end.  Scent lasts more than other similar Pinaud colognes/aftershaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use and own the Lime Sec, Reg clubman, Bay Rum and now this Vanilla scent from Pinaud.  I would say this vanilla one and the bay rum are my number one scents.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that I really smell a  lot of vanilla in this product.  It smells absolutely wonderful, but not a lot like vanilla.  I have had many compliments on how great this product smells.  I heals nicks and cuts quickly and man oh man does it cool the face when applied.  I love it.  I plan on getting all of the after shaves made by Clubman Pinaud.</li>
    <li> Smell like Grandpa used to smell, thats a GOOD think. Np foo foo lade smell, manly man fragrance, burns real nice after a close shave. If you don&#x27;t mind the heat............</li>
    <li> Nice old school barber shop smell, but I rather have the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> lots of comments on it .</li>
    <li> I use several different brands of cologne and aftershave lotions because I like to change things up every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried this Clubman Vanilla and the original Clubman. I like both, but prefer this vanilla one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some aftershaves have very little scent or just don&#x27;t last. No so with Clubman. The pleasant scent lasts for hours. Just make sure you only use a few drops. The fragrance is different than most other high cost products. I&#x27;ll have to agree with most reviewers in that the best way to describe the scent is of the old time barber shops. But, this is not a bad thing. Sometimes you just can&#x27;t improve on a proven classic that has shown to stand the test of time and is still popular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should also be aware of some well known facts. First, after application of several minutes, the scent will be far more subtle and pleasant. Also, every fragrance will smell different on different people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. I think you&#x27;ll like it and so will others around you.</li>
    <li> My new love affair with mens aftershave scents!</li>
    <li> Refreshing without being too strong.</li>
    <li> smells delicious. i use this brand of aftershave daily and am always impressed. I wish the scent lasted longer than an hour though.</li>
    <li> I regularly buy clubman products. This is my favorite smell, I cycle through the rum bay, and original aftershave. But the classic vanilla is my favorite one. I plan on trying the reserve and musk aftershave on a later date.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely hated the smell of Bay Rum, abhorred it. I still wanted a good clean after shave and did some research and came across the Vanilla scent.  It is fantastic and she love it.</li>
    <li> so no complaints with the seller.As for the Pinaud itself---this is not the same scent they were selling as vanilla several years ago,which is what I had wanted.</li>
    <li> good product for healing razor nicks.  no alcohol. fragrance is non-plus</li>
    <li> Might be my favorite Clubman scent!</li>
    <li> Classic clubman product.  Great price and fast delivery.  Vanilla sent with a little bit of a musk undertone.  Not one of my daily wears but great for something different</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of the Clubman&#x27;s aftershaves and this is mine and everyone who smells it Favorite! Speedy Delivery! Fresh Product! Cool and Crisp~</li>
    <li> As all of you are aware, I&#x27;m a handsome man.  That&#x27;s why I keep coming back to Pinaud products.  I really like the Classic Vanilla.  Wonderful manly, refined scent.  It does have a wisp of vanilla.  Not &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;, like some of the lime based splashes, but sophisticated.  Stings going on, which I like, and the scent lasts through the day.  At night I still get a wisp o&#x27; the vanilla.  I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars, as it doesn&#x27;t give a &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; sensation to the face, like Shulton Old Spice or Captains Cat O&#x27; Nine Tails.  Vanilla never dries my face and actually conditions it.  I spit on the &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; who won&#x27;t slap an alcohol based aftershave on the muggin&#x27; because it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34;...whhaaaaa!  For those kind of &amp;#34;fellas&amp;#34;, may I recommend some creamy Vagisil?  Oh, I must add that ladies adore this stuff.  My wife is particularly fond of it.  Walk into a club wearing the Vanilla where every other guy is wearing some cheap, overpriced cologne, smelling like a hive of Havana pimps, and watch the ladies gaze their stare upon thee....whoooaaaa!  Go get &#x27;em tiger....Vanilla!</li>
    <li> It came rather quickly and it smelled very nice was not what I expected but I like it a lot. Very fresh and light smelling</li>
    <li> This is my favorite clubman scent. Not too sweet, subtle vanilla rolled into that old school barber shop smell. Drys down pretty fast. Doesn&#x27;t last very long on me, that&#x27;s why 4 stars.</li>
    <li> The smell of this stuff doesn&#x27;t appeal to me at all. No more for me.</li>
    <li> This scent was just a little to &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; smelling.  Yes, it smelled good, but my husband prefers Clubman ORIGINAL or the Clubman MUSK.  This was just a little to sweet for him and me.  HOWEVER!!!!!  My 15 year old really liked it, so we gave it to him.  It does smell good on a young adult.  We are just used to a little more subtle sophistication and maturity offered by the Clubman Original scent and the MUSK scent.  This seems to work well for the younger (14 - 25 maybe?) generation.  My husband is in his 50&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  We have the same opinion of this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok and when I first went to put it on I got a wiff of skunk... Don&#x27;t know why it had a skunky hint at first?</li>
    <li> Not my main aftershave but a good second. I normally use regular Clubman but will switch this in as a good change of pace.</li>
    <li> Really nice scent. Smooth not overpowering!</li>
    <li> Used it today for the first time and product it great! I dont know what people are talking about the bottle i got does not smell like urinal cakes nor is it over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Clubman!</li>
    <li> Wow...my vanilla aftershave arrived today.  Smells fantastic, very clean, crisp and not too strong but also a lasting scent.  Also, I have to say the packaging was amazing, it arrived in a &amp;#34;Pharmapack&amp;#34;, I was not sure what I was opening at first...but the AII wants to make sure your product arrives in tact with no leakage and they succeeded.  Excellent value for less than $7. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the scent but not as effective as Witch Hazel</li>
    <li> I had never used regular clubman before a couple weeks ago except years ago (as a younger man) when getting a shave at the barbershop. I hadn&#x27;t done that in years. I recently started using old-fashioned shaving soap, with a brush and decided to buy some original Clubman. A week later after reading some reviews about the Vanilla Clubman (especially the &amp;#34;Polish Grandfather&amp;#34; and suit/cufflinks reviews)...I ordered it. I love this stuff; classy, manly and timeless. Clubman vanilla easily stands equal with all the expensive designer options at the department store.</li>
    <li> I just received this along with a bottle of Special Reserve.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the scent right out of the bottle but I shaved and gave myself a generous splash of Classic Vanilla and WOW! This stuff smells really fine and it hasn&#x27;t even settled in yet.  I&#x27;ll have another splash an hour or so before my wife gets home and get her opinion.  The burn wasn&#x27;t quite as strong as Clubman but close enough to satisfy and the initial blast of scent wasn&#x27;t quite as strong but it is definitely a Pinaud after shave.  I love Clubman but I can tell this is going to give it a run for its money.  I&#x27;m really liking this - very complex scent.  Someone mentioned that this smells like Aramis and it certainly does.  I had a good friend who always used Aramis and I&#x27;m very familiar with it.  I&#x27;ve worn Gentleman Givinchy  cologne since 1972 but was always tempted by Aramis.  I like this just as well and there is a bit of a price difference between the two.  To me, this doesn&#x27;t have the barbershop smell of Clubman but is, deep, soft, full, complex, sophisticated and definitely alpha male. It has all the positive attributes of Clubman but in a different scent. You can have a change up after shave without giving up anything.  I wish this came in a cologne and I wish I had known about this many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow, I will try the Special Reserve but I doubt it it will be better than Classic Vanilla. Someone said SR is a good winter AS but I don&#x27;t think Classic Vanilla will warrant a seasonal restriction.  I&#x27;ll review SR tomorrow.  I&#x27;m 66 years old and have no desire to attract any more women but I do have to shave every day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not sweet vanilla if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.  This is the typical Clubman wakeup call, but with a little lighter scent.</li>
    <li> Has a nice soft vanilla scent that is not too strong or weak, but entirely pleasant. Will burn on cuts you get from shaving, but also soothes your skin. Scent lasts all day on me!</li>
    <li> A better fragrance than the Classic, surely will get the attention from others close to you. As it also heels and cools your skin after your shave it leaves your skin very smooth Clubman does it again as they have been for years</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very close to the original classic Pinaud which screams old time barbershop manliness but with the Vanilla scent smoothing it out a bit.  Lasts a long time without being over powering.</li>
    <li> Very soothing, with a pleasant scent..not overpowering. Unique, in it&#x27;s own way, with a scent that seems much more expensive than it really is.</li>
    <li> Great for use after a hair cut and use after a hot lather neck shave at Hair Affair in Upton, Ma. by Gloria</li>
    <li> i wouldn&#x27;t say it smells anything like vanilla. if anything it smells like chamomile or something flowery. Not a bad product i still used it but in my opinion it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like vanilla.</li>
    <li> My husband insisted on using the original scent for years and I could not stand the smell. I purchased this for him for x-mas last year and was very pleased with the scent. Way better than the original. Fellas, do yourself a favor and switch to the vanilla if you are still using the original!</li>
    <li> Scent is light and refreshing--goes on great after a shave but does not last long-very faint after 2-3 hrs. Still a great scent, and I recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an old school alcohol heavy scent that lasts quite a few hours.  It hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin yet, but I go light on it after a shave.  The scent is pretty close to the original, but a bit more mellowed out I think.</li>
    <li> Pinaud Clubmen Products are the BEST and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Smell the BEST and  FEEL LiKe a MASULINE&lt;br /&gt;MEN. Am very glad to discover this vanilla Scent #1 in my book. 10 Dollars well spent. ED ,PINAUD CLUBMEN #1.</li>
    <li> One of their best,clean fresh smell</li>
    <li> Not one of my favorites of the Pinaud line of aftershaves. Much too subtle in scent compared to other Pinaud products that I am currently using. (Original, Special Reserve and Bay Rum). The scent has a VERY slight vanilla undertone with a scent that finishes off with extremely watered down BRUT</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong when you pay under 5$ for aftershave and your wife loves it??  Great bargain price for an essential product!</li>
    <li> Very great but be careful it is really easy to put too much on. If u do, it smells like Adidas cologne or something</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. Stings a bit if you have nicks, but smells great, light, and old-timely. My wife lives it on me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a gargantuan fan of the original Clubman aftershave, as well as their musk scent, and although I don&#x27;t quite like this version as well as the other two, I still like it enough to give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It smells nice but it is not good on irritated skin. (probably bc of the alcohol. I started using aftershave from Dove. No burn and it does the job even on irritated skin.</li>
    <li> Smoother than I expected and I love it. I love the original and wear it twice a week still, but the Vanilla is definitely a nice clean scent that my wife enjoys. I feel as though it hydrates my skin well, but I do not suffer with dry skin since I have switched so good quality shaving soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  It is not over powering and very enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Not sure why its called Vanilla, cause I don&#x27;t detect any, but this is some nice aftershave. The scent is great. Feels good after a shave. What more can u want ?</li>
    <li> My go to aftershave and a little splash for cologne. The smells lasts a decent amount of time too, which is really nice.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as the original Clubman scent, but not too shabby. You get just a hint of vanilla. I&#x27;d like it better if it had a little stronger vanilla sent to it.</li>
    <li> Classic barber scent, just not sure what the vanilla was about.</li>
    <li> Frankly, this is not very good. It smells like alcohol mixed with vanilla, which might sound logical when considering aftershave. BUT, if you&#x27;ve ever smelled the classic Pinaud Clubman (regular green bottle), you know that one smells like baby powder and barbershop wonder. It does not smell like straight alcohol mixed with a filler scent. So, even if you&#x27;re curious, I&#x27;d pass on this one. Stick to the classic Pinaud Clubman; that one can&#x27;t be outdone. Cheers.</li>
    <li> Great smelling aftershave. Smells like warm Vanilla. I get a lot of compliments on the smell. I will continue to buy great Clubman products such as this....</li>
    <li> Another Great Product Clubman Pinaud. I just love the Vanilla it is nice and subtle aroma.</li>
    <li> Great vanilla smell and very effective after shave.  Feels and smells good.</li>
    <li> I should have ordered the regular Clubman. This doesn&#x27;t last very long. The aroma is not what I expected. now</li>
    <li> I have been using a barber for about 20 years that always used the original Pinaud, and I loved it. I started cutting my own hair (thanks, MPB!) and ordered both the original and the vanilla Pinaud. Love them both but favor the original maybe just a bit. But I plan on keeping them both and restocking both.</li>
    <li> The Clubman Pinaud &#x27;Classic Vanilla&#x27; is a great product. One of the best - if not the best - aftershave lotions produced under the Clubman line of products. It has a lighter smell and aroma than the standard Clubman aftershave. No noticeable \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot; smell, but a clean, fresh, slightly sweet and distinct aroma of its own. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Classic sent for the American gentleman. its how every man should smell. I would recommend this product to men of any age</li>
    <li> Awesome unique smell and vanilla has been proven to turn women on</li>
    <li> NOT BAD. SMELL FADES FAST</li>
    <li> Another great product by Clubman, and their best in my opinion.  The scent is unique, not as intense or powdery as the Original Clubman.  Floral with a subtle hint of vanilla (spice, not sweet), that dries down nicely.  Not as assertive as the Original, it simmers down after an hour or so to where you can barely get a whiff of it occasionally.  Initial alcohol burn followed by a soothing warmth.  The skin feels smooth and comfortable after the dry down.  Not as &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; as other after shaves that contain witch hazel and glycerin, but not bad either.  A great value for the price.  Wish it were available in local stores, but at least I can grab a bottle here on Amazon when I run low.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not smell bad, but it does not smell very &amp;#34;vanilla-ey&amp;#34; It reminds me of hospital sanitizer or a urinal puck. Masculine and barbershop-esque, but not something I would wear on a date. The alcohol does tighten up my face after a good shave and that is what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> Incredible smell.  Has the alcohol sting, but not too bad.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very light vanilla fragrance - not like most vanilla aftershaves, which smell like sugar cookies.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but it seems to wear off pretty quickly, and has a bit of a skunky smell to it.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for its antiseptic properties. When it came I shaved for work and used it and noticed the aroma was just that very antiseptic. After a few minutes the vanilla kicks in and it&#x27;s light and very pleasant. It does what it says and smells like it also. This will be my go to daily aftershave.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, wish it had staying power!</li>
    <li> Smells great if you want to smell like an old man. Wouldn&#x27;t suggest to anyone under 40.</li>
    <li> I love the parfum fragrance it has staying power. I work in an non air conditioned warehouse and yesterday outside it was 100 degrees with a heat index of 106 and after 12 hours I could still smell the fragrance when I got home from where I put it on before I went to work. Even $80 cologne I bought can&#x27;t seem to do that. It seems to have a low alcohol content so does not burn as much as other products. The bottle opening is small and looks like this lotion will last for awhile.</li>
    <li> The After Shave is sort of like the stuff the barber will spray on your hair when getting a hair cut. I apply it on my hair after shampooing &amp; showering. It is also nice as an After Shave. It doesn&#x27;t seem to keep the fragrance very long...a few hours maybe. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very good product and worth the price</li>
    <li> Brings back moments from the past, being at the Barber shop as a kid. Very refreshing smell and manly. Will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> I chose three stars because the smell is not at all bad, but it&#x27;s simply not to my liking. It has a scent reminiscent of old spice or something along those lines, I can&#x27;t nail it down. And if I&#x27;m going to smell like the 60&#x27;s I&#x27;d rather it be the 1860&#x27;s and not the 1960&#x27;s. I love the Lime Sec and the Bay Rum.. those are great old timeless fragrances. Its just that the vanilla was a little bit over powering to me and it has no detectible vanilla smell to it at all. I also noticed that as the day went by, the fragrance took on somewhat of a stale scent even though it&#x27;s January and a cool temperature..Maybe it&#x27;s just me, a friend here at work liked it. Said it reminded him of his Uncles.. ha ha..  It aint bad, but I&#x27;ll stick to the others.</li>
    <li> No burn and a tight feeling on your face afterwards.. Not overbearing smell.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product with a refreshing scent. To bad Amazon has a add on policy. A deal breaker for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the line of Clubman aftershaves by Pinaud.  This one has a nice smell to it.  Some say they can or cannot smell vanilla.  I think it leaves a very light vanilla-esque scent behind, but it&#x27;s very soft.  I do believe that the term &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; refers more to the color of the lotion, instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to try some on to see if you like it.  Do not smell from the bottle.  The scent will change once it&#x27;s dried on your skin.  It&#x27;s a long lasting scent and I enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day.  It goes on with a sting, which I enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like vanilla; all I know is it smells GREAT. Not powdery or flowery like the Original or the Musk; doesn&#x27;t kick you in the face like the Bay Rum or the Special Reserve; not the complexity of the Lilac Vegetal (good grief, nothing on this planet smells like The Veg). Granted, there is nothing subtle about any of the Clubman after shave scents; but this one is different...it&#x27;s a light scent. Also, you don&#x27;t get much alcohol burn from this one. The light scent has some legs and I have received many compliments wearing it. Like all Clubman scents, you will smell like a clean-shaven mature adult that cares about his grooming routine.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty nice.  I learned about it on the B&amp;B forum.  Smells awesome, but it&#x27;s super watery and I wouldn&#x27;t use the term &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; to describe it.  If you scraped or cut yourself during the shave, you&#x27;ll know very quickly after applying this.</li>
    <li> So you&#x27;ve decided to join an early 1900&#x27;s underground bare-knuckle boxing circuit! Well good chap then you need a proper scent to show your manliness, and manly you are! This silky lotion that contains an alcohol base will serve you well! It&#x27;s sharp, and manly scent could be almost be described as a type of musk. No more are the days where you will wear designer scents by that good time traveling fellow in those popular jeans, a Mr Calvin Klein I believe. You now have the scent of true manhood strong and robust with a hint of sweetness that will drive those ladies mad with desire after they see your performance in the ring!</li>
    <li> This aftershave is hard to find. It was delivered promptly and was exactly as advertised. It&#x27;s nice to get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> the risen i gave it 3 stars because the pice was not bat and the smell is ok but you can&#x27;t smell that much vanilla in it</li>
    <li> Smells like my grandad. Not a hint of vanilla scent anywhere. So don&#x27;t buy it for that. But it does leave my face feeling refreshed after a shave. So I&#x27;ll give it that.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to aftershave. Smells awesome with a sandalwood shave soap/cream. Great quality for a great price.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wear this too often because of all the ladies that come swarming around me....otherwise its the best scent on the planet</li>
    <li> I really like this.  It works great and smells great. It has a very classic smell to it.  The smell last through a good part of the day which personally I like.  Working in the business world I like the classic, but light smell it gives off.</li>
    <li> This is a great scent for the price.  Not as &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; as the original Clubman. Maybe a little more on the lighter side.  Some people say that they can&#x27;t detect any vanilla in the scent but I do although just faintly.&lt;br /&gt;I find this scent to be for those who want an affordable aftershave but think that the Original Clubman is a little dated as I do.  It has a sweeter scent if that makes sense.  It seems to last all day for me.  My wife likes it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every shaver should have at least one Pinaud Aftershave in their collection.  I recommend this one and the Pinaud Virgin Island Bay Rum equally.  I have both and wear them both.</li>
    <li> This aftershave lotion has a very nice masculine scent. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it isn&#x27;t weak. After a good old fashioned wet shave, it soothes my skin. This is easily my favorite aftershave.</li>
    <li> C&#x27;mon. You want a classic scent? This is it. Refreshing and professional. Good for everyday. A welcome addition to your routine morning</li>
    <li> Closes your pours after a shave it smells incredible and with its cost point you can literally dump it over your head its a five star hidden gem, the ladies like the original more than the vanilla but I like to change them up a little</li>
    <li> This is very nice aftershave. It has a classic manly smell, yet isn&#x27;t overpowering. Many aftershaves are simply too strong for me to wear. This one is very nice with a much more subtle fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, my wife commented that i smelled like her Grandfather, but soon grew to really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I first tried Clubman Classic aftershave, then the Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum and both are excellent. When I tried Clubman Classic Vanilla, it became my favorite. The scent is just wonderful without overpowering. It&#x27;s light scent stays with you, though. This is a &amp;#34;must try&amp;#34; for anyone who has used and liked Clubman in the past. You are going to love the scent of this after shave after just a few seconds of applying.</li>
    <li> I have not used after shave in 20 years, so I am a born again virgin on this product type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clubman Vanilla after shave is not really overly vanilly in smell, that is OK.  Smells nice, rolls on easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that my post shave routine is soothed by using aftershave to ease the nicks and such.  I have recently switched over to Double Edge safety razor on the toss away multiple head shavers.  The DE Safety razors are very sharp, and nicks now occur, were they were seldom on the duller toss aways.  So a good after shaved seemed a worthy product to try, and it works.  I guess granpa was pretty smart after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars, not 5 - I only 5 for truly outstanding products.  This is very good, and recommended.</li>
    <li> I have paid about twenty times more per ounce for products with this type of scent. I absolutely love it&#x27;s clean scent with a touch of vanilla. Not sure about the after shave properties since I just use it as a cologne.</li>
    <li> This after shave is fairly strong, but is a very nice old-school fragrance &amp; I&#x27;ve received compliments on it. Moreover, it is very soothing to the face.</li>
    <li> When I received this and first smelled it I was reminded of an old man smell, but a classic aftershave/barbershop smell. After using it the smell did not smell like an old man smell maybe since it wasn&#x27;t as concentrated. But it smells great and feels very refreshing putting it on after a fresh shave. I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time! :)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like vanilla</li>
    <li> Really great classic clubman scent. It is quite understated and very pleasant through most of the day. I like to wear it to work on most days where I want to smell nice but do not want to be obnoxious.</li>
    <li> Love that old timer smell once in awhile. You don&#x27;t need hair spray either if you have medium to long hair.</li>
    <li> Pinaud fragrances are classics which remind me of my grandfather and visits to the old tyme Barber Shop...happy times again!</li>
    <li> I was looking for that old school brand new haircut smell from my younger days. This product filled that order. Not overpowering, and a clean classic smell. I would definitely recommend this product for a day time, work aftershave. I would like to see a return to the classic glass bottle in stead of the plastic bottle but I&#x27;m sure that the glass bottles are gone forever. None the less I don&#x27;t feel you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used almost every product from the famous and fabulous Pinaud company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their hair tonics, after shaves, talcs; all top notch.  I love the subtle scents that they make: Totally masculine but not cheesy.  That is a difficult thing to achieve in a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why I was so disappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all of their aftershaves, it works really well to sooth burn.  But the SMELL! Ugh. After I put it on, I smelled like an overpowering combination of Drakkar Noir and Axe Body Spray.  I can&#x27;t think of why this company, known for it&#x27;s timeless fragrances  would put out such a generic smelling product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, many people like these contemporary fragrances in their aftershaves more than I do.  For them I say \\&quot;more power to you\\&quot; and this product will serve them well.  But not for this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the original Pinaud.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap, but not very powerful, and seems not to last very long with it&#x27;s faint fragrance.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this one after already loving the regular Clubman after shave. I opened the package and could already smell the after shave. I got some on my hand and was smelling it all night. I love the way it smells! My girlfriend also readily agreed that the smell was superb. I just cant wait to start using it! I need to use up the other one that I had but now I am thinking that I might just skip right to this one because I love the smell so much. I think this will be my new usual after shave. Thank you Clubman!</li>
    <li> I tried this particular fragrance to offset the Lilac Vegetal first used in Danang &amp;#34;back in the day.&amp;#34;  I like this product and have had some interesting complements on it at school.  Some of the Asian students recognize it immediately.  Another good choice for our desert heat-sink summers.</li>
    <li> Old timey of course and has a light fragrance which can hardly be detected by others. Pinaud makes great&lt;br /&gt;aftershaves AND it&#x27;s made in the good old USA which is so much better than buying junk aftershave made in China from&lt;br /&gt;recycled industrial solvents judging by the smell of such things regardless of their brand or price.</li>
    <li> Product was leaking when it arrived and the contents had turned to what essentially smelled like rubbing alcohol. I&#x27;ve loved other pinaud/clubman products so I&#x27;m chalking this one up to vendor error/oversight.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the first time based on reviews. I like it!. Good old fashioned scent- clean and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> It sort of smells like my grandfather...  but in a good way.  Not going to wow the ladies, but it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel!!</li>
    <li> There is vanilla buried in there, but it&#x27;s difficult to detect, its elusive, but it&#x27;s in there because I do catch a whiff of it now and then.  I don&#x27;t know what I would call this one, but vanilla is not the predominant aroma.  This is the kind of aftershave that smells different in the bottle, and upon first application than when you&#x27;ve been wearing it a while.  If you shake the bottle, it has a solid alcohol hit, on the skin it&#x27;s something else, I can&#x27;t put my finger in it yet.  It eventually does mellow, and over time, transforms into a more subtle &amp;#34;color&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m not implying that it&#x27;s a bad scent, but if you are looking for something more like the Pinaud Clubman original, then this is not it.  It&#x27;s definitely different than that.  Still very masculine, still old-school, but for me, this just doesn&#x27;t do it.  I still prefer the Pinaud Clubman original scent, and I&#x27;d even choose Aqua Velva over this one.  I&#x27;m going to keep this one around though, and use it from time-to-time.  I do prefer the old school shaving kit over the modern trendy stuff, and maybe this will grow on me.</li>
    <li> Good scent, but like the regular scent a little better.  Still use this from time to time just for a change.</li>
    <li> Like the original but a bit mellower, and sweeter. Doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla as it would if it were a cologne, but very nice.</li>
    <li> 9 out of 10 women thought this after shave was the BOMB...&lt;br /&gt;its ok to say Bomb right, ???</li>
    <li> Those old time ingredients are also allergens. I liked the smell, at least one girl noticed it. But, it made my throat sore. After about two days, I could not even put it on. Too bad because I like vanilla aftershaves, and they are hard to find at a decent price. I have found Royall Vetiver as a replacement.</li>
    <li> This aftershave is so good, the only reason a real man would not buy it is so he could tone down his general manliness.  Good barbershop smell (that lasts a while), the perfect burn, gives the skin a clean feel to the touch.  For the price, this is one of the top man scents!</li>
    <li> The aroma is not overwhelming like I thought it might be. My wife loves it and so do I! It is a very distincted, familiar smell.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I get complements on how great I smell on a regular basis!</li>
    <li> Good stuff but wears off quick</li>
    <li> I like barbershops and &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; sorts of things.  This combines those two elements in one bottle.  Not overpowering, the scent diminishes over a period of about 4 hours. Perfect for an office or business setting.</li>
    <li> Since becoming a wet shaver, I have been using aftershave instead of the Eau de Toliet  sprays. Comparing the vanilla to the original Pinaud[[ASIN:B000053L6Y Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce]], the vanilla is  more subtle and fades to the background much quicker. Perfect for those days when you do not want your aftershave to take the attention away from others; like when attending a funeral or someone else&#x27;s wedding.  My every day remains Pinaud Orginal, a scent that says good for me, lucky you!</li>
    <li> I Love love love both the original Clubman Pinaud scent and Classic Vanilla. I discovered safety razor shaving a few months ago and both the Clubman Classic Vanilla and the original scent are both perfect compliments. I alternate, why not. A true affordable luxury, I can&#x27;t wait to shave. The ladies love the smell! How can we go wrong with Clubman? With Feather blades in my Merkur safety razor and Clubman Pinaud, my shave is closer, smoother, I smell better, and I enjoy the luxurious barber shop experience. And I save money. Way more for less money than disposable razors with cans of goo. I will NEVER go back to disposal razors!!</li>
    <li> Add me to the legions of men who like that barbershop smell, and a simple, clean and manly aftershave. I have used the original Clubman for years and thought I would change it up a bit, so ordered the vanilla scent. At first a bit &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; but after a couple of uses it really grew on me. I now think I like it better than original!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.... Unlike other clubman products however this stuff fades fast.  It is a great aftershave like poraso but it won&#x27;t last an hour.  If you are looking for a long lasting aftershave that doubles as a cologne special reserve or original clubman should be your choice.  This stuff with your favorite cologne is a winner.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal.  Amazing scent...</li>
    <li> Like the old school fragrance, not overbearing.</li>
    <li> I was a little dissaponted in the product,since it was many years since i last used it. The odor was different and it diod not meet my expatations,although perhaps i ordered the wrong fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff. It isn&#x27;t as strong as I usually like, but I think its intended use was to be mild, so I can&#x27;t find fault there. If I&#x27;m going to work or someplace that requires low odor, I use the classic vanilla. When a bolder fragrance is acceptable, I do like the special reserve or bay rum. As with all Pinaud aftershaves, the burn is invigorating, and it leaves the skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Great After shave smells really good this just might be my favorite will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love Pinaud, what can I say! I was at the Christmas Tree Store and saw this on the shelf and I said to my self, &amp;#34;wow, that stuff has been around forever&amp;#34;. I saw the price was only around $7 and figured, how good could it be and, summarily dismissed it. After several more visits to that store, I finally decided to crack one open and give it a smell. Brought me right back my youth at the barber shop - cleanup around the ears and back of the neck with the straight razor, then, the splash of Pinaud. I had to have it. A lot like their regular scent but with a slightly less sweet aroma. Love and use Both. You can spend lots more but can&#x27;t bet better.</li>
    <li> one of my sons favorites.  scent is great, has already put his request in for more. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love all the Pinaud Clubman aftershaves.  This is my favorite scent.  It really doesn&#x27;t smell much like vanilla, but it is sweet and sexy.  It reminds me of Angel for men.  Makes my face smooth after shaving, and the scent is one I never get tired of.  I will absolutely purchase this again, as with all Pinaud Clubman products I use.</li>
    <li> So this doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla to me.  There&#x27;s more vanilla underneath the strong cinnamon smell in Pinaud&#x27;s Bay Rum.</li>
    <li> I like it, new to the world of after shave, so as my first one not much to say other then its not the vanilla you think of for cookies or anything like that, there is a classic old school feel to the scent.</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant scent and smooth feel when applied. The vanilla is not strong in it and only lends to a mild spicy scent rather than making it sweet. I will very likely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the classic clubman but with a different scent. Love this vanilla!!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. Astringent and not perfumey. I switch off between this and Aqua Velva and the changeup feels refreshing. The price is right too. no sense on over spending on a toiletry like aftershave. I save the money for cologne.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the so do my clients, One of the best classic aftershaves out there. Love it.</li>
    <li> Like the special reserve after shave I will use it from now on!</li>
    <li> Not very Vanilla to me and does not last very long at all. Its not a bad smell just not Vanilla</li>
    <li> This aftershave smells great right out of the bottle and even gets better after a few minutes on the skin.  The Clubman vanilla aftershave is unlike any other aftershave out there and definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> My wife and I really like this scent. It&#x27;s probably one of my more manly scents. It isn&#x27;t very vanilla-ey, and I find it to be somewhat refreshing while being quite musky! It also isn&#x27;t too strong! I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about the Clubman, but it is my love of Clubman that is the telling sign about the Vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanilla is a strong 2nd for me, and my wife&#x27;s favorite scent on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it on a lark - I like the scent of vanilla generally, and the price simply cannot be beat.  Smells good on me, the Mrs. really likes it - what could be better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 4.5 if possible, with the 5 reserved for Clubman.</li>
    <li> Got it for the boyfriend and I love the smell so it&#x27;s a done deal. As a plus, he says it&#x27;s good for the skin too. He says it helps with the irritations of shaving. I wouldn&#x27;t know. Didn&#x27;t use it myself personally.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for a long time.  Glad to have finally found it here.  Product is exactly what I wanted.  Has a great smell and is unique,.  Even though it is an &amp;#34;old time&amp;#34; fragrance, not many people remember it so you stand out with it.</li>
    <li> Very happy surprise here!  I grew up with &amp;#34;Bay Rum&amp;#34; as a manly scent.  Kind of like Old Spice - but less flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are over 17, please skip the &amp;#34;AXE&amp;#34; and the imitators.  Nobody likes to be slapped with a cosmic cloud of reek when you walk by.  (And no, the girls are not magnetically attracted to an AXE cloud...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased a few different types/flavors of Bay Rum scents over the years, never finding &amp;#34;the right&amp;#34; scent.  Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect rendition of what I remember.  Slightly spicy/complex - but not flowery or overpowering.  Downright zingy after a close shave in the morning.  (And I don&#x27;t leave a smelly &amp;#34;backwash trail&amp;#34; as I walk through the cubes at work...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to the folks that figured this out.  Classy, strong, manly (not flowery) scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JDMc</li>
    <li> Love the smell, won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Men...I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re young or old but, for the price, you can&#x27;t get a better smelling after shave.  I&#x27;m 54 and I get compliments from ladies from age 8 to 80.  You cannot go wrong.  I gave some to my dad (82) and he asked for more.  I use about a thimble full, spread it on both palms and use it more as a cologne rather than an after shave on my arms, chest, neck and a bit on my face.  Unless you get really excessive, someone has to be pretty close to you to smell it and it&#x27;s never overpowering for your own nose after use.</li>
    <li> Smells like a MAN&#x27;S barbershop. Good value</li>
    <li> Have been using designer aftershave for years. Now that I&#x27;m old I nneded something that really works on razor burn. This works.</li>
    <li> Not enough vanilla fragrance. I like the lilac vegatal better. But, it&#x27;s a good value for the money. Also, the bay rum is quite good.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both love this scent, its been around a long time lasts long enough. I recommend this to all real men there are so few of us left, most guys now a days us the cream stuff, Hey guys it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> liked the smell more of a clean soap smell than vanilla, to me anyways. but like it just the same</li>
    <li> I liked this after shave felt good on my face, smells great, but within a couple hours the scent is gone. would I buy again, NO.</li>
    <li> I like the Clubman Pinaud aftershaves. My wife didn&#x27;t care for the classic scent but does like this vanilla scent. It&#x27;s mild but does smell nice.</li>
    <li> PRIMO! outstanding value.</li>
    <li> I have never used a traditional after shave splash,  having used &#x27;balms&#x27; for years. Over the last 6 months I returned to &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; with a safety razor, shaving soap, and brush. This is really a nice product. I do not &#x27;get the vanilla scent&#x27; but the product leaves a nice masculine scent that is not overpowering. It calms the skin, leaving a cool aftermath that is most refreshing and healing.</li>
    <li> Great product, great smell! Not loud either. My 20 yo son liked it so I bought him a bottle too.</li>
    <li> Smells so manly it puts hair on your face.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does what it is supposed to do. Even when I don&#x27;t shave I mix a bit into my unscented face lotion a moisturize my face.</li>
    <li> quick delivery great product</li>
    <li> When I opened the bottle, my first thought was it smelled like a cheap old man scent. After I applied the after shave the scent mellowed to a more complex, difficult to describe scent.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t quite smell like vanilla, but man does it smell good. The wifey loves this stuff, and therefore, I do too. Pinaud uses a minimal amount of healing and therapeutic ingredients, but its enough if you don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin. If you do, I&#x27;d recommend something with witch hazel, aloe, and glycerin instead.</li>
    <li> This after shave splash has just the right amount of \\&quot;burn\\&quot; and feels invigorating.  The scent is mild and classic, and is slightly reminisant of vanilla extract, hence the name.  I prefer this to Lilac Vegetal because of the mild scent, which won&#x27;t clash if you want to finish with your favorite cologne.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> im a delivery driver for UPS and this after shave is a hit many pple mention how good it smells even after several hours i gota stock up and get more :)</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the classic Clubman scent and tried this one out in the interest of some variety.  After trying it out a few times here are my main points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It has a less intense feel when I put it on my face (compared to the classic).  I&#x27;m not going for the full-on Bay Rum smack in the face but I do like a little intensity to it.  If you want a milder feel then this is probably a good bet for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It seems to work well, as far as the feel of my face 20 minutes after I shave.  I think it works approximately as well as the other clubman products I have tried, so it gets solid points there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell.  I had read enough not to expect a sweeter vanilla flavor (which was a good point for me) but it is not a good scent for me.  It reminds me of Brut or another similar after shave, not my style.  If that sort of scent works for you, then try this out but it is not a good fit for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never seen this scent in stores before &amp; was curious to see what it smelled like.  Love it!</li>
    <li> A god smell is based on the individual.  I am a huge fan of Pinaud Clubman AS Lotions, but I think I will stray from the vanilla.  It created an almost &amp;#34;mosquito spray&amp;#34; aroma on me.</li>
    <li> got it . Smelled it and out to the bin it went.  Whew what a load of cheap scents.</li>
    <li> I shaved the twins and splashed this stuff on and it burned like I just sat on a fire breathing bidet. It has a classic scent and its different than the original Clubman, but it is still in the vein. It&#x27;s powerful too. Even if you splash it down below it will penetrate the clothing barrier.</li>
    <li> NEVER EVER been a user of after shave of any kind. Since I&#x27;ve been doing very well with my shaving techniques (from electric back to razor 2x blade) I decided to add Clubman to my arsenal. With the combination of the aftershave and Clubman Repair Gel. I&#x27;m delighted to say that I really like this product I chose the vanilla scent thinking it would have a lite scent (so so) it does not overpower at all. It&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I am surprised at how great this is. My wife loves it. The smell is similar to colognes that one would pay sixty bucks a bottle for.</li>
    <li> Great aftershave at a great price. This will make your skin feel great after shaving.</li>
    <li> Great after shave, light, soothing, shipped on time.</li>
    <li> I like Clubman but this Vanilla scent was not for me.</li>
    <li> 3 males &amp; 1 female agree -- nice scent!</li>
    <li> Its good stuff.  Like everyone says, it doesnt smell like vanilla.  But it isnt supposed to.  It has a nice, light, barbershop smell.  I like it.  You may not.  I also enjoyed the movie Patton, The Dirty Dozen, and caddyshack, if that helps.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  One of the best after shaves I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Leaves skin smooth, but not real oily.  It also has a fantastic smell.  I&#x27;ve received multiple compliments about.  Will definitely buy this again, and also try some of the other Clubman Pinaud after shaves.</li>
    <li> I agree with other revues that it doesn&#x27;t have that vanilla smell like a candle but a hint of vanila it does smell crisp and good. When you splash it on you feel clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Pinaud has been around for more than 200 years, so they&#x27;ve been doing something right. I own 7 of their products and this is one of my favorites. Only the classic Clubman can top this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Scent --&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the vanilla you are thinking of...this aftershave is very masculine, musky, and (when first applied) is very pungent. It&#x27;s citrusy with a hint of powder that&#x27;s classic yet very old fashioned. My wife loves the smell, but sometimes says it&#x27;s too strong. It is one of the longer lasting aftershaves and will stick around for several hours after it&#x27;s applied. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this with another fragrance or you will be pigeonholed as being \\&quot;that guy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Performance --&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s alcohol based, so there will be some sting, but I personally like the sting. It doesn&#x27;t sting as much as their Bay Rum or Lilac Vegetal, but it will definitely get your attention. It&#x27;s not particularly moisturizing, but works fine during the summer or if you live in a humid environment. For the winter or dry climates, I highly recommend checking out a quality aftershave balm or using an unscented moisturizer followed by a nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s one of my favorites. I&#x27;m in my 40s, so I feel seasoned enough to sport the VM. I&#x27;m not sure how I would react to a 20 something that wore this aftershave, but it&#x27;s not up to me to decide that.</li>
    <li> I purchased after many people have said how \\&quot;long lasting\\&quot; it was.&lt;br /&gt;It stopped giving off a smell before I got to work(1hr post shave).&lt;br /&gt;I asked a few friends/coworkers if they could smell the new aftershave... they told me \\&quot;you just smell clean, but no aftershave smell.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;This is nice as a standard Pinaud Classic but it is NOT special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will not replace an EDT by any means, nor compliment one as the scent is soon lost.&lt;br /&gt;I would rate it 1star but that&#x27;s mostly b/c I&#x27;m butthurt from expecting a long lasting scent that reviews here and other shave sites have suggested.&lt;br /&gt;Thus a solid 3. Nice initial, but nothing special. I&#x27;d easily forget if I used this product or the classic scent Pinaud after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as far as a REVIEW goes:&lt;br /&gt;You get the standard burn/skin tightening you get from other Alcohol based AfterShaves. Which feels great for sweltering summer days. But leaves you slightly irritated on winter days without applying a moisturizer. I&#x27;d recommend this product to only those who with good shave technique(it burns bad otherwise) and those who want a tight skin feel. Pairs perfectly with a good Talc powder for summer days. (note: with talc on the neck line, your sweat will stain your collared shirts less easily.)</li>
    <li> Every person&#x27;s body reacts to fragrances differently. For some people the Clubman Pinaud Classic Vanilla After Shave Lotion will be perfect.  For other folk, it&#x27;s going to be a disaster.  The only way to find out is to slap a bunch onto your face and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you&#x27;re waiting to see how your body reacts to the after shave you can feel it go to work. Small nicks and cuts check in so you know the after shave is doing its job.  If you shave with real live well water then a real after shave is a necessity.  This product will work to keep a nick or cut from being infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some girls told me the fragrance reminded them of their Dad. That may or may not complicate a relationship. There&#x27;s a lot of history wrapped up in the fragrance of Clubman Pinaud Classic Vanilla After Shave Lotion. I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a classic.</li>
    <li> Great, long lasting scent!!  Would highly recommend this!!  And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  Will order more definitely!!</li>
    <li> out of all the ones i&#x27;ve tried this one probably smells the best, it and one I bought locally is good also.</li>
    <li> I really like the way thus stuff smells. Some people say that the scent reminds them of their grandpa, but it doesn&#x27;t bug me at all. Nice vanilla scent, and usually I can still get hints of the scent even after 7-8 hours after application. Doesn&#x27;t burn my skin or leave it feeling irritated.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this aftershave and I get so many compliments about how good I smell.</li>
    <li> smells like rotten egg. i try to give it away to anybody but everybody that smells it gags. dont buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this aftershave! Simple as that! I am 17, and have been &amp;#34;wet-shaving&amp;#34; for about a year now with a safety razor. And if you&#x27;re worried about &amp;#34;smelling like an old man&amp;#34;, you shouldn&#x27;t be. While you&#x27;re playing video games at your age, your pops was probably in the military! That&#x27;s back when men were men! But don&#x27;t get me started on that. Just saying, smelling like an old man isn&#x27;t a bad thing. And Not only the aftershave, but the seller is outstanding! MY OPINION ON THIS SELLER: If you&#x27;re worried about receiving an overpowering-smelling package with a crushed and empty bottle inside, worry no more! I can assure you this bottle wont break in transit! PharmaPacks shipping is far by the best I&#x27;ve ever had! All the products I&#x27;ve bought from them, including this aftershave, came in a very cushioned bubble-casing inside of a bright blue &amp;#34;PharmaPack&amp;#34; package. Trust me, you&#x27;ll never receive anything damaged from this seller! Now onto the aftershave! MY OPINIONS ON THIS AFTERSHAVE: Pinaud Clubman is famous for its classic &amp;#34;barbershop scent&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll try my hardest to describe this scent (having just put it on after a great wet-shave). It&#x27;s not overpowering by any means. It&#x27;s very floral, but still masculine. The vanilla scent is definitely there, but again, not overpowering. Pinaud has somehow found a way to make floral and vanilla very masculine. Honestly, it smells so good, I&#x27;m tempted to reapply it after it has worn off! Now, about the face-feel. It&#x27;s very soothing and doesn&#x27;t have much, if any, alcohol-sting like Aqua Velva (I love AV as well, but it has a crazy strong alcohol sting, which I like). It&#x27;s leaved my skin feeling hydrated, healthy, smooth, and super soft! I might also note that there&#x27;s no menthol/cooling affect like many other aftershaves. But it&#x27;s still very nice! Overall, I recommend this aftershave and seller 100%! Happy shaving friends!</li>
    <li> I love this scent! I was looking for a more mild alternative to the bay rum that I have so I figured I would try this. I was not disappointed! The scent is mild enough that I can use it after a normal shave and not worry about smelling up the whole room.</li>
    <li> In my opinion this is the best of the pinaud line. The vanilla is very small and more like honeysuckle. Refreshing and bright,this is definitely a spring and summer aftershave.</li>
</ol>
