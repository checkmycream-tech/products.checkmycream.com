    <li> I would have to shave off my own brows to match it. Dont like at all!!! Did not match up. The whole thing way to small. Had to throw it in the trash!!!!!</li>
    <li> Hilarious but not helpful</li>

    <li> Awful product. Not only did it take forever to get here but it is not even use able&lt;br /&gt; Please don&#x27;t waste your money&lt;br /&gt; I threw mine away</li>
    <li> I thought it would be smaller.</li>
    <li> Worthless unless you want to look like a clown</li>
    <li> Too hard not comfortable and hard to hold in place while using it.</li>
    <li> i put in garbage. don&amp;#34;t waste money</li>
    <li> Just got it, BROKEN. It&#x27;s very fragile. Doesn&#x27;t fit right on the face. Won&#x27;t be able to use. Don&#x27;t buy it. Cheap!</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected and doesn&#x27;t line up on face as shown, not even on my teenage granddaughter. Because of this problem you try to do one eye brow at a time and it still doesn&#x27;t line up accurately ....... very awkward and inconvenient to use.</li>
    <li> This is really a bad product. It does not adjust to different face shapes and brow shapes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even fit correctly &amp;#62;:(</li>
    <li> I waste my money buying this rubbish if I had a choirs I would not have given it a rating at all</li>
    <li> One of the items came broken hard plastic couldn&#x27;t get my eye pencil in to trace</li>
    <li> very difficult to work with, i wear glasses... i also thought that there would be 3 differnt molds, the one that i received did not quite match my brow shape...  the mold was way too narrow and short,&lt;br /&gt;should cost .99 cents or less.</li>
    <li> I only received one and it was bent on one side &amp; broken on the other. will never order Again</li>
    <li> Most definitely will let all my friends know to purchase this product also! I have problems applying my eye brows on. Either one side is lopsided or the they don&#x27;t match at all. With this tool my eye brows come out perfectly every single time! And very easy to use and clean!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for someone, and the only complaint was that the instructions were not in English.</li>
    <li> This product was broken when I received it</li>
    <li> impossible to line tool were eyebrows are. Tool only goes a little way toward eyebrows therefore stencil brows land on eyelid.</li>
    <li> Different kind of tool</li>
    <li> NOT EASY TO USE, HARD TO LINE UP WITH OTHER SIDE, SHAPE DOES NOT LOOK NATURAL.</li>
    <li> took forever to receive it then it was cracked!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not so much the tool, it&#x27;s more so I have really messed up brows. They are very high up and the tool can&#x27;t be adjusted to accommodate that. so it doesn&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> Pencil doesn&#x27;t fit into the holes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it :/ if it was bigger it would have been nice to use!</li>
    <li> Threw it away not good</li>
    <li> This cheap tool isn&#x27;t simply working. You have to have a lot of brows in order to use it successfully. IMHO I would not spend money on this.</li>
    <li> Play toy for kids. Need to go back to the drawing board with these items.  Cannot be used easily!</li>
    <li> I was supposed to get three stencils only revived ONE,the blue one , am very disappointed with this order.</li>
    <li> VERY DIFFICULT TO DO BOTH EYE BROWS AT THE SAME TIME. SO THEY ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT UNLESS YOU HAVE THE TIME TO DO ONE AT A TIME</li>
    <li> Not the size i wanted</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for this. First I thought I&#x27;d be getting 3 different ones with slightly different brow shapes but no I only got one and it just messes me up holding that thing on my face</li>
    <li> Very very very bad and received broken</li>
    <li> Hard to manage but would have been great if the instructions were in English too.</li>
    <li> I do not like this little item.</li>
