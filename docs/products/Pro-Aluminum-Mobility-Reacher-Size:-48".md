      <li>Handy...  </li>

      <li>The jaws do not produce a very strong grip.</li>
      <li>Good grip and light weight.</li>
      <li>This thing has good reach and is ergonomically sound, but I couldn&#x27;t get the clasp to grip the cords of some high-up wood blinds I wanted to open/close.  </li>
      <li>But, that wolud make it cost more.    </li>
      <li>If it were for anything more than picking up trash while mowing, I would have returned it, but despite being beat-up it works for its intended use.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work or not - now we know.</li>
      <li>Ok, then.  </li>
      <li>and then some, so I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>but, I want to be able to lift heavier objects.</li>
      <li>Based on the reviews, I ordered this one; I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
      <li>Overall, perfect product and construction.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to be able to use it to reach the chain on my entry way ceiling fan</li>
      <li>great product and fast shipping</li>
      <li>But now that I have adjusted I am able to pick almost anything up with it.</li>
      <li>This does and OK job.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not 5 feet tall and volunteer in a gift shop that has MANY things out of my reach.  </li>
      <li>They may be better for heavier objects.  </li>
      <li>Works better than I thought it would.  </li>
      <li>but more of a plastic grip which lets items slip out.</li>
      <li>Glad I got the 4 ft length.  </li>
      <li>but again, no biggie for me since I use it for \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; reaches more than anything else.  </li>
      <li>At the top it&#x27;s called a \\&quot;Pro Aluminum Mobility</li>
      <li>Items on top shelves are within reach, though sometimes all you can do is pull the item toward you.</li>
      <li>Pretty good design, pretty good quality components.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty darn good.  </li>
      <li>This supplier cheerfully shipped me a replacement in a short time and I am very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>This 48&amp;#34; Pik Stick is a nice thing to have around no dislikes right now</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it and says it will also come in handy after she recovers for reaching items on the top shelves of her cupboards.  </li>
      <li>Love the length to keep our fish pond clean of leaves.</li>
      <li>On my shorter grabber I can easily have it still in my hand</li>
      <li>It is strong, sturdy and picks up heavier items than the grabbers I have used.</li>
      <li>great product ,the best picker upper you can buy but it will stick closed sometimes</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine now.  </li>
      <li>This device is well thought out, should last a good long time and is a wonderful relief for those of us stricken with arthritis.</li>
      <li>after I bought the 32 inch pik-stik , I knew I had to have the 48 inch from Reid Industries to complete all of my very important needs , Thanks for Your great insite , James Wall</li>
      <li>I have back problems and this is great</li>
      <li>I think it is worth the cost as copared to others which cost substantially more.</li>
      <li>It works great to grab the hangered item and remove it from the rod or to put it back.</li>
      <li>This is a great grabber makes the size of the room shrink enormously.</li>
      <li>This has been a very useful tool.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, quick delivery.</li>
      <li>The grabber end rotates easily with a quick pull and turn.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light-weight, so very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I have tried several grabbers, and this is by far the best for me.  </li>
      <li>Especially great for the hard to reach items within the home, but I have one in my handyman&#x27;s shop for reaching items handing on peg board hooks.</li>
      <li>The PikStik is more of a \\&quot;flat\\&quot; system, like keeping your hands straight and clapping.  </li>
      <li>Could be good for grabbing things above reach in the kitchen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve picked up a garbage can full of leaves and twigs since I purchased it and it works reliably every time I need it.</li>
      <li>Package arrived quickly and seems well built.</li>
      <li>and you can lift things and bring it right to you with out too much effort. :-)</li>
      <li>I even ordered a second, shorter version (the 32\\&quot; version) as this 48\\&quot; model is too long for some jobs (but perfect for getting things out from under furniture of off shelves).</li>
      <li>It is also lightweight, strong, and very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Also, I find it great for use in my green house where I have to hang plants with chain hooks overhead.</li>
      <li>light,,,even under water, good texture and grip to pick up wet and degrading leaves.</li>
      <li>Well-made, worth the money.</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t worth the bother.</li>
      <li>Living in the woods I am finding it the perfect length to pick up pine cones and other things that would damage my lawnmower blades - and my back with bending over over and over again.</li>
      <li>This is great for getting to those items put on shelves that at just a little higher thand my wife can reach.  </li>
      <li>This was a gift for my brother in-law who is paralyzed on his right side.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>The reviews here doesn&#x27;t seem to be right.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not working for picking oranges.  The reviews here doesn&#x27;t seem to be right.</li>
    <li> Not good for my purposes which is cleaning trash off our county road ditches.  It is too long for my arm and the distance to the trash bag.  It also has very poor gripping strength as well as jaws that don&#x27;t actually meet for gripping small items.  Could be good for grabbing things above reach in the kitchen. I should have checked into it further for my purposes.</li>
    <li> great product ,the best picker upper you can buy but it will stick closed sometimes</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who is paralyzed on one side.  He still likes to tinker in the garage.  We have a ceiling mounted heater in the garage.  I thought this would be perfect for him to be able to grip the knob on the heater and turn on/off the heater himself from his wheelchair.  The length is perfect but the grippers just aren&#x27;t very strong.  He can grab the knob but the part that grips feels like it&#x27;s about to break when he twists the grabber to move the dial on the heater.  It works, somewhat, but I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Pretty good design, pretty good quality components. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on its overall durability... however the price almost makes it seem disposable.    Buyer beware though, this particular item is too long for just picking stuff up on the ground. Get the 26 inch version instead.</li>
    <li> Long but cannot hold onto item very tight and grips at end not really soft rubber but more of a plastic grip which lets items slip out.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the most wonderful grabbing tool I have ever owned. This unit is almost twice as long as regular grabbers and is much more sturdy than the rubber tipped junk grabbers you see everywhere. This device is well thought out, should last a good long time and is a wonderful relief for those of us stricken with arthritis.</li>
    <li> Very good quality! I like it!</li>
    <li> This was way too long, the grabber locks when you use it.  I prefer the Gopher II.</li>
    <li> After recent hip surgery I need help reaching things.  I have tried several grabbers, and this is by far the best for me.  It is accurate enough to pick up a small pill dropped on the floor, and strong enough to push the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button of my computer down near the floor.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this to help in pulling weeds that were inside a giant pumpkin patch, which we didn&#x27;t want to step into (trying not to compress the soil).  The PikStik is not able to hold the weed and pull it out.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work or not - now we know.</li>
    <li> we&#x27;ve recently completed building a home. Needless to say, with that comes lots of trash.  Couple this with recent back surgery. I needed a bit of help.&lt;br /&gt;I love my new little friend.</li>
    <li> I can reach things with it but the grasper isn&#x27;t always strong enough.  I was hoping to be able to use it to reach the chain on my entry way ceiling fan but it can&#x27;t grasp it.  I have a hanger hook taped to the end of a doweling that works as well.</li>
    <li> Great item. Well-made, worth the money. Very pleased with purchase and shipping speed. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could fish leaves out of my pond without tramatizing the fish with a net.  It&#x27;s perfect!  Nice, long, waterproof.  I really like how you can adjust the gap opening: it can open fully or only halfway, and when only halfway it requires much less squeezing of the handle.  This makes it very easy and comfortable to pick up lots of little things without your hand getting tired.</li>
    <li> Not very strong. A shorter one has already broken off at the handle shaft connection picking up a can of food. The latch that locks the handle down digs right into my thumb joint. Very painful or someone with arthritis.</li>
    <li> Just had back surgery, so I bought 3 lengths of this tool - use them everywhere, indoors &amp; outdoors!</li>
    <li> I think he product is great. My hens just started to lay eggs. Sometimes they drop them in places that are hard to get to under the hen house. This grabber is sensative enough not to berak the shells when I use it to get those wayward ones. I think it is worth the cost as copared to others which cost substantially more.</li>
    <li> This tool is perfect for anyone who needs a bit more \\&quot;reach\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t want to (or can&#x27;t) climb on stepstools or ladders. Items on top shelves are within reach, though sometimes all you can do is pull the item toward you. One drawback -- the locking mechanism has to be reset after each \\&quot;grab.\\&quot; As an aside, the shipping carton for this item was absurd-- at least three times larger than it needs to be and a great waste of cardboard (and shipping charge?)</li>
    <li> The Pikstik is a quality product.  I&#x27;ve tried the cheaper ones with the suction cups.  The screws come off and get lost.  The Pikstik has no screws to come loose.    Because of the 48\\&quot; length, it would be difficult to pick up heavy objects.  I picked up a 5Lb. hand weight, but it took two hands.   The Pikstik  also comes in 26\\&quot; and 32\\&quot; models.  They may be better for heavier objects.  Also, it has a 5\\&quot; opening.      The one thing I would add to the Pikstik would be a lock.  So, once an item was picked up, you wouldn&#x27;t have to keep squeezing the grip to hold on to it.  But, that wolud make it cost more.    If you are looking for a grabber within the limitations listed above, this is it.</li>
    <li> After back surgery my friend was having trouble picking up and putting down food/water dishes for her pets, so I sent her one of these.  She absolutely loves it and says it will also come in handy after she recovers for reaching items on the top shelves of her cupboards.  It really does the job and then some, so I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Have owned / used it for a short while, but it has paid for itself already ! My back goes &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; 2-3 times a year, and getting items off the floor is pain city max, to say the least ! I am tall, so tle long length is extremely helpful. My dog&lt;br /&gt;is &amp;#34;paper trained&amp;#34;, and removing the soiled newspapers is a real challenge. This tool makes it soooo much easier, and when done handling the papers, I wipe the claws down w/ antiseptic coated paper towels.&lt;br /&gt;Picking up, cleaning around the house has become much easier as well. Picking up clothing off the floor for washing is a piece of cake now!  If found to be defective over time, I will re-evaluate, but I highly reccommend it as of this writing !</li>
    <li> I operate a rough mower on a golf course, and this is great for picking up lost golf balls, trash, and debris without my having to get off my machine regularly. Lightweight and 2works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This thing has good reach and is ergonomically sound, but I couldn&#x27;t get the clasp to grip the cords of some high-up wood blinds I wanted to open/close.  The cord is not that difficult to pull manually, so I&#x27;m disappointed that this gripper could not do the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this grabber shortly before I had major back surgery.  I do like it a lot, however, be aware that once you pick something up with it, you can&#x27;t get it back to you because it&#x27;s too long and doesn&#x27;t bend.  Not a biggie...just needs some getting used to how to handle the situation.  I now use it to grab things that are way too far out of my reach, I lay the item I picked up on the counter or on something near by depending on where I&#x27;m at in the house, then I just set down the grabber and walk over to get my item.  On my shorter grabber I can easily have it still in my hand and I can bring the item to me, however, I can&#x27;t reach really high or far distances like I can with this longer one.  My shorter grabber folds up so I can carry it with me, this one does not...but again, no biggie for me since I use it for \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; reaches more than anything else.  I wish I had thought to have these grabbers years ago....but better late than never.  These are certainly life saving gadgets.</li>
    <li> This is a little long but it works great</li>
    <li> This is a great tool. If you have two people and don&#x27;t want to get out of the truck, the person on the passengers side can pick up the cans or trash from the truck, and toss it in the back! It is a little too long for those people who pick up the trash on foot.</li>
    <li> This one reaches far and grabs pretty well. I can reach those problem leaves and figs now.</li>
    <li> Great item and a good quality product. You can feel that it is well made when you pick it up, does not feel cheep. I have picked up some pretty heavy items with this and no problems at all. The grabber tip style took about a hour to get used to, as I had primarily used suction cup styles in the past. But now that I have adjusted I am able to pick almost anything up with it. Highly recommended and far stronger then the cheep fold up suction cup grabbers.</li>
    <li> I have a couple hard to reach / access spots around the house and this gives me access without moving &#x27;things&#x27; or contorting myself.  Handy...  Probably handles up to 5-6 lbs.  -  God bless...</li>
    <li> This is the best grabber I have ever purchased.  It is strong, sturdy and picks up heavier items than the grabbers I have used. I bought the 42 inch one to reach items in high cupboards.  GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Everything came as promised on time.</li>
    <li> Would be 5 stars except that the grip is a little weaker then I&#x27;d like, so I have to be careful to maintain a fairly high force... enough that I worry about breaking it. That stated, the product does what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> In theory this item sounds  very handy ..and it is..but the problem is it broke very easily!..now useless ..not going to repurchase.</li>
    <li> very effective if picking up pine cones.  the handle is a little too long, but it works for me.  trust the plastic grabber will hold out</li>
    <li> I had one of these and I broke it my fault completely. tried another brand but hated it ! went back to this one, love it even more after trying to use the other one. sure helps around the house!</li>
    <li> a little long but I take it fishing and when something falls in the lake,  I can retrieve it,  so buy one.</li>
    <li> Loved this!  Used it from the back of my horse to pick up garbage off the trail.  Was even able to pick up small thin items like paper.  Good grip and light weight.</li>
    <li> The jaws do not produce a very strong grip. For instance, it is very hard to pick up a 16oz can of soup, even though the &#x27;bow&#x27; of the jaws is very wide. However, because of the wide jaws, it is very hard to pick up something lighter and smaller, like a pill bottle. The jaw tips are very flexible, so precision pinching, like picking up a pencil is also not doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As near as I can tell this is only useful for picking up half-full rolls of toilet paper from 4&#x27;&#x27; away. I would return it but it isn&#x27;t worth the bother.</li>
    <li> Already doesn&#x27;t pick up things in my pond securely after three weeks of no heavy use. Wish I could send it back... Chalking it up to a bad experience that will not happen again...</li>
    <li> thid really helps my wife to mreach things when I am not at home, only drawback is this particular model , to me, is just a little too long.</li>
    <li> This is a good stick, only be careful not to drop it on the plastic handle, it may crack or break.</li>
    <li> This 48&amp;#34; Pik Stick is a nice thing to have around no dislikes right now but there is one thing I would like to say.... Because it is so long you really need two hands to hold it, if the item is a little heavy you will need two hands to guide it... Can be hard on the wrist with one hand...</li>
    <li> My own fault...it&#x27;s too long.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my brother in-law who is paralyzed on his right side.&lt;br /&gt;This was a much needed gift for him.</li>
    <li> I have these all over the house to reach things that I used to use a chair for to stand on.  much safer.</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s 4 ft. length gave it the unique extra foot length quality I needed to retrieve clothing items that occasionally fall behind a washing and drying machines.  It does the job well.</li>
    <li> Prompt deliver, exact item.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Good sturdy tool. I have back problems and this is great has enough strength and is long enough for me to clean up the yard or pick up all the things I drop</li>
    <li> Bought this to pick up trash along the road as I am mowing grass. Thought 48\\&quot; would be great reach from my lawn mower seat.  Package arrived quickly and seems well built. Cardboard advertisement attached to the pic stick say&#x27;s will rotate 90 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) WRONG The 48\\&quot; inch stick is a fixed position grabber (will not rotate). If you are picking heavy item like a wet newspaper or beer bottles, the 48\\&quot; reach really puts extra strain on your wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Also find that when you are retrieving trash from the jaws with your other hand, the stick make for a long aukward reach between both hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping the stick for lighter household uses, but will be ordering 32\\&quot; for the trash pickup, hopefully it will be easier to handle for my use.</li>
    <li> The product came bent in half.  It was poorly packed in small thin box.  Now I have to waste my time and gas to repack and take to post office to return.</li>
    <li> Like all these &amp;#34;grabbers&amp;#34; you are limited by weight but the extra length is well worth it. Just remember to support it with your other hand if picking up something heavy.</li>
    <li> This is a great grabber makes the size of the room shrink enormously. Using these grabbers is a truly life changing moment for someone who is disabled.</li>
    <li> Stick works great! I&#x27;ve had this brand before, but the one that got delivered was obviously used. Its decals were half worn off, the rubber tips were scuffed, and there was a greasy hand print on the squeezy handle. If it were for anything more than picking up trash while mowing, I would have returned it, but despite being beat-up it works for its intended use.</li>
    <li> I would pick one of these up.</li>
    <li> I use this to grab things under the table or behind the dresser I can&#x27;t reach! I wish it was a bit shorter, makes picking up after the kids easy you don&#x27;t have to bend to always pick up little papers.</li>
    <li> did not have a locking handle as advertized</li>
    <li> great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I use this for picking up trash up and down our country road. The extra length allows me to get the trash out of the ditches without having to get down in the ditches. It works great !!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in a wheelchair and have used at least a half dozen brands reachers and the PikStik is the best so far.  That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s perfect but it&#x27;s pretty darn good.  I have 3 of them now in varying lengths and I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems mentioned by other.  The oldest one had a lock lever that will hold the tongs together and part of the lever mechanism rubbed the top of my hand and was very irritating.  I modified it with a file and it&#x27;s fine now.  They must have dropped this feature as none of the recent ones I&#x27;ve gotten have the lock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon ad I bought this one from is misleading though.  At the top it&#x27;s called a \\&quot;Pro Aluminum Mobility Reacher\\&quot; and in the pic it&#x27;s orange but further down in the product description it says it&#x27;s a \\&quot;Yellow, Aluminum, Pik Stick\\&quot;.  I wanted and got a yellow PikStik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also PikStik&#x27;s customer service seems to be non existent.  On their site, the only way to contact them is through their embedded contact page.  I sent them a product question on February 13 and never heard back.</li>
    <li> after I bought the 32 inch pik-stik , I knew I had to have the 48 inch from Reid Industries to complete all of my very important needs , Thanks for Your great insite , James Wall</li>
    <li> I ordered both and have posted my pictures for reference above.  The PikStik has a larger capacity to pick up items, as you can tell from the photo.  It is slightly shorter than the Ettore.  Both have heads that rotate.  The pickup part is configured differently on each one.  The PikStik is more of a \\&quot;flat\\&quot; system, like keeping your hands straight and clapping.  The Ettore has a bit more of an edge that is more like cupping your hands slightly and clapping.  It seemed to me the Ettore picked up a coin lying flat on a table just a little more easily than the PikStik, but both performed the same when the coin was on a carpet.  If you need the larger capacity, then the PikStik is your choice.  If you need the extra two inch reach, then the Ettore 50 inch is your choice.  If neither of those is a factor, you can choose whichever looks best to you or is least expensive at the time of your purchase.  You&#x27;ll be happy with either one.</li>
    <li> I thought I would just use this to get items off the higher shelves, but I have used this to pick up things that fall into tight spots as well.  It comes in handy in ways you would not think of.</li>
    <li> Oh I goofed on that one. It is much to long for the purpose intended. . I should have sent it back but kept putting it off. Not your fault . It is still a great product .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 5 feet tall and volunteer in a gift shop that has MANY things out of my reach.  This does and OK job.  Have to be careful with anything that has weight to it as it doesn&#x27;t like to hold well.</li>
    <li> This works very well.  It has really helped me around the house a lot.  I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> it does the job &amp; can even pick up heavy stones . . .</li>
    <li> Product was way to long for my purpose. Couldn&#x27;t tell how long it was on the screen. Need to return it.</li>
    <li> We use this in our walkin closet as it is has a vaulted ceiling and we have a 3rd tier of clothing.  It works great to grab the hangered item and remove it from the rod or to put it back.</li>
    <li> Nice product for picking up things and doing yard work without having to bend over.  Maybe a little too long.</li>
    <li> Got this for my sister who had a hip replacement and she says it is the bomb. Go for it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Received product extremely damaged from shipping. This supplier cheerfully shipped me a replacement in a short time and I am very happy with the product. Works great for picking up debris in the street and also things that fall into hard to reach places in the house. Very well made as well.</li>
    <li> Ordered this because my husband had hip replacement surgery. It was wonderful for helping him pick up things around the house when he was unable to bend over. Since he has recovered I have found myself using it almost daily! I am 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and it is great for picking up things that fall behind the computer so I no longer have to crawl on hands and knees and go under. Reaches things in the kitchen I used to call hubby to get for me or pull out the step ladder.  Living in the woods I am finding it the perfect length to pick up pine cones and other things that would damage my lawnmower blades - and my back with bending over over and over again. Great, convenint well made item. Arrived quickly - love it!</li>
    <li> This is great for getting to those items put on shelves that at just a little higher thand my wife can reach.  Recommend this product for those with short reach.</li>
    <li> I can now reach what I need to reach without having to lift a heavy stick besides the item I want.  The stick is lightweight, long enough for most job and I can contol the head.  The ability to rotate thehead is what has me sold on the product.  It changes with what you want to pick up.</li>
    <li> Two lumbar surgeries have made things like picking up litter more than just a chore, but a dangerous one, too. One slip and fall and another herniated disc is my biggest fear. I can pick-up everything from Sonic sacks to empty quart beer bottles with the pik-stik from the drainage ditch that borders my property. If it were only wide enough to grab our Mayor by the neck, I would hold him in the ditch while I read him the Federal, State, County, and City stormwater regulations which he ignores.</li>
    <li> Longer than normal so I can reach over my fence and pick items up.</li>
    <li> When you need to reach something that is too far away this is the tool that you need. It doesn&#x27;t bend in the middle like some other models do and you can lift things and bring it right to you with out too much effort. :-)</li>
    <li> Easy to use, quick delivery. Sensitive enough to pick up a coin on the ground.&lt;br /&gt;Saves wear and tear on my back.</li>
    <li> we needed one of these that was long enough to reach the center of our koi pond to remove leaves, this does the job perfectly! Fits perfectly i the hand, light,,,even under water, good texture and grip to pick up wet and degrading leaves. Handy tool! My koi are happy and healthy.</li>
    <li> I have two small dogs whom I spoil with many toys and chew treats. That means that my home ends up having a lot of junk scattered on the floor, under and behind furniture, etc.. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4\\&quot; tall and stooping down (and kneeling) to pick it all up got to be a chore (and pain). Trying to think of a solution to my problem (and a firm believer that there is almost always a more efficient method to accomplish any unpleasant task), I suddenly recalled seeing groundskeepers using this tool. I had no idea what it was called, but eventually found it here on Amazon by doing several key word searches. There were several brands available. The other grabber brand with suction cups looked flimsy to me (the fact that they sell replacement suction cups is an admission of its poor quality). Based on the reviews, I ordered this one; I&#x27;m glad that I did. I began using this immediately: I picked up dog toys, treats, and even a sponge that fell behind my washer that I had given up hope of ever retrieving. This is lightweight but well made. The grabber ends seem to hold on to everything without slippage (my guess is that the weight limit is about five pounds or so). The grabber end rotates easily with a quick pull and turn. I love this. I help with landscaping at my church once a month and I am going to bring this with me so that I can pick up garbage without having to get down on my knees. I even ordered a second, shorter version (the 32\\&quot; version) as this 48\\&quot; model is too long for some jobs (but perfect for getting things out from under furniture of off shelves). This is a great tool. Every home should have at least one!</li>
    <li> This thing works perfect for my uses. It is also lightweight, strong, and very inexpensive. Overall, perfect product and construction.</li>
    <li> Words great and long enough to reach far away but, I want to be able to lift heavier objects.</li>
    <li> I received this item and initially was pleased with it except for the fact that it was supposed to have a lock on the handle that locked the jaws shut.  My item did not.  I contacted the seller via Amazon telling them that my item didn&#x27;t have the lock on it that it was supposed to have.  They responded back and requested the UPC number from the packaging.  I supplied them with this information. They replied asking me what exactly the problem was.  I told them (again) that the item didn&#x27;t have a lock on it like it was supposed to that locked the jaws shut.  They simply replied by saying they would request a refund for my purchase price but said nothing about whether I got the wrong item or why mine didn&#x27;t have the lock it was supposed to have.  Ok, then.  I guess it was appropriate that they requested the refund because a day or two later I went to use the item and the claw on the end of the device fell completely off.  As far as I can tell there is no way to reattach it.  I can see inside the end of the aluminum tube that there is a thin metal cable which the claw attaches to.  However, the metal cable ends several inches short of the end of the aluminum tube so there is no way to reach reach the cable to the claw.  The other end of the cable is pop rivieted in place inside the handle so the cable can&#x27;t be unattached and slid further down the tube to allow it to be reattached to the claw.  The item is completely worthless now that the claw has fallen off.  I contacted the seller again to see if there is anyway that I haven&#x27;t figured out yet to perhaps fix this issue.  So far, they have not responded to my inquiry at all.  Seeing as the item fell apart after a few uses I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this item.  I&#x27;m guessing that since this item normally has a pretty decent review rating that they must simply have a quality control issue with their products.  Either that or people who have left decent reviews haven&#x27;t bothered to update their review for the product later if they have had a problem with it.if they have had a problem with it.</li>
    <li> Works great gor egg collecting in back corners of chicken coop ... very sensitive to grip</li>
    <li> It is so long I don&#x27;t have to bend at all. It picks up everything from the dog toys  to a sheet of printer paper dropped  on the floor. I love it!!</li>
    <li> opening shades, closing an upper cabinet. Pushing up the top double hung window by it&#x27;s frame. This has been a very useful tool. I have a shorter one as well, but, it couldn&#x27;t get the window frame up.</li>
    <li> Especially great for the hard to reach items within the home, but I have one in my handyman&#x27;s shop for reaching items handing on peg board hooks. Also, I find it great for use in my green house where I have to hang plants with chain hooks overhead.</li>
    <li> Reacher is long at 48 inches, but lacks gripping power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should have returned it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to pick out trash from the canal by my house, where I&#x27;ve seen an alligator or two on more than one occasion, making me not real eager about getting close and falling in.  This picker solved the problem and works great.  It&#x27;s very light-weight, so very easy to use.  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Love the length to keep our fish pond clean of leaves.</li>
    <li> like the long shaft but the handle needs to work better....it gets stuck sometimes.</li>
    <li> Works better than I thought it would.  It can pick up a flat leaf off of a concrete surface, no problem.  Glad I got the 4 ft length.  I use it to reach under patio furniture, behind objects, and into tight places.  Great for avoiding contorting and saves a lot of bending over.  I&#x27;ve picked up a garbage can full of leaves and twigs since I purchased it and it works reliably every time I need it.</li>
