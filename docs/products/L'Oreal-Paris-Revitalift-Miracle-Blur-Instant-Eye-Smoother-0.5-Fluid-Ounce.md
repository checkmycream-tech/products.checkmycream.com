      <li>I have used many products &amp; there just isn&#x27;t one that works unless we go under the knife!!</li>
      <li>Make up goes on so nice!</li>
      <li>It may work for others and good on you.</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>and I love it !</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Some eye creams I&#x27;ve tried have that greasy feel that kind of lingers.</li>
      <li>This product does the job for about an hour, in that it really kind of blurs the area.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good eye cream!</li>
      <li>Works fair but wears off quickly</li>
      <li>THIS REALLY WORKS!!!!</li>
      <li>Lets face it ladies we&#x27;re all looking for a miracle, right, but there isn&#x27;t one!!  </li>
      <li>Easy to care in your purse if needed</li>
      <li>It looks smoother and decreases fine lines.</li>
      <li>I started using it and didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Not sparkly fortunately.</li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>and I felt like I needed a full size one to try it out.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s my favorite one so far.</li>
      <li>As good as expected.</li>
      <li>Not even worth trying to return it.</li>
      <li>and I saw a positive change!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sasatisfied,  especially considering the price, and will buy more.</li>
      <li>I love this product I saw instant results.</li>
      <li>I am an almost 70-year old woman, who has just developed bags under her eyes - big surprise and great dismay.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly, It really help to blur my fines lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>I really like the texture of it</li>
      <li>No idea if it works - like so many products for your skin, you&#x27;ll never really know if you&#x27;re hallucinating</li>
      <li>This one actually absorbs quickly, but gives you that hydrating plump feel.</li>
      <li>but I highly doubt it.</li>
      <li>I use the whole line of Miracle Blur all over my face, but this one is formulated for your sensitive under eye area.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s kind of thick</li>
      <li>I would recommend the entire line to any woman who is just starting to show creases, to smooth them almost immediately.</li>
      <li>Would recommend this product even for older women it works very well enough to get through your daytime affairs.  </li>
      <li>After 1-2 hours the effect has worn off and the bags are clearly visible again.</li>
      <li>it irritates my sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>It is soothing and practically erases lines completely.  </li>
      <li>Super soft cream for the delicate under eye area.</li>
      <li>Shows up as white if it is not carefully massaged in .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have used Miracle Blur face lotion and think it&#x27;s great but this practically did nothing for me and also has a sort of greasy feel to it after putting it on.</li>
    <li> No. not impressed. See no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This appears to work for a short time, but has no permanent effects.</li>
    <li> Works well but it&#x27;s kind of thick</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for about a year and it&#x27;s my favorite one so far. I&#x27;ve tried a few different ones. What I like about this one is the feel of the actual cream. Some eye creams I&#x27;ve tried have that greasy feel that kind of lingers. This one actually absorbs quickly, but gives you that hydrating plump feel.</li>
    <li> I have substantial under-eye circles, and bought a trial size of this at the drugstore.  One eye actually looks worse than the other, so I used the product on that eye for a week, and was surprised to notice that it actually looked better thethan the other.  So I started using it on the deep creases between my eyes, and around my lips, and saw improvement also.  The wrinkles are still there, but much less noticeable.  I&#x27;m sasatisfied,  especially considering the price, and will buy more.</li>
    <li> I use the whole line of Miracle Blur all over my face, but this one is formulated for your sensitive under eye area. It is soothing and practically erases lines completely.  I would recommend the entire line to any woman who is just starting to show creases, to smooth them almost immediately.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! I&#x27;ve tried many expensive brands, but only with Miracle Blur I&#x27;ve seen results in my dark circles problems</li>
    <li> Lets face it ladies we&#x27;re all looking for a miracle, right, but there isn&#x27;t one!!  I do not see any difference at all w/this product.  I do not recommend spending the money. I have used many products &amp; there just isn&#x27;t one that works unless we go under the knife!!</li>
    <li> I first tried this as a small sample and I felt like I needed a full size one to try it out. It seems like its working and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Super soft cream for the delicate under eye area. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days but I&#x27;ve already noticed less puffiness!</li>
    <li> I had tried the Miracle Blur for your face and wanted to give this a try.  I started using it and didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the fine lines under my eyes.  It is moisturizing under my eye but probably won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> this product doesn&#x27;t work on the deeper wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t hold up all day (8 hours.)  Don&#x27;t expect miracles with this product.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this product even for older women it works very well enough to get through your daytime affairs.  Easy to care in your purse if needed</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed that this did not work for me - I was using it for under eye bags! A very slight difference- but I did use it around the lines around my mouth- and I saw a positive change! I do buy a product for my under eye bags on Amazon and I will stick with that since it does work but much more expensive!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a miracle...</li>
    <li> No idea if it works - like so many products for your skin, you&#x27;ll never really know if you&#x27;re hallucinating or if it is making a difference. I judge by ow it feels going on and this feels great - cold tip makes you feel like it&#x27;s doing something, but it&#x27;s probably just cold that feels god as it rolls on. I use because of that, no idea if it&#x27;s making time roll backwards...but I highly doubt it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since last year and I love it !</li>
    <li> Shows up as white if it is not carefully massaged in .</li>
    <li> I am an almost 70-year old woman, who has just developed bags under her eyes - big surprise and great dismay. This product does the job for about an hour, in that it really kind of blurs the area. After 1-2 hours the effect has worn off and the bags are clearly visible again. I will have to keep on searching.</li>
    <li> As good as expected. Thanx.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> THIS REALLY WORKS!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good eye cream! I really like the texture of it, it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  I do notice a difference under my eyes. It looks smoother and decreases fine lines.</li>
    <li> Not a fan! I have been using L&#x27;oreal products \\&quot;designed\\&quot; for men for quite some time. I figured why not give this a try, especially at such a low cost. I see no improvement with my skin under the eyes. Quite the opposite. My eyes are puffy and swollen and it looks like I have not slept in days! I am not the only one who has noticed the puffiness under my eyes. Granted, it could just be my skin or a reaction I am having with the product. It may work for others and good on you. Either way it is now in the trash! Not even worth trying to return it.</li>

    <li> Works fair but wears off quickly</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, It really help to blur my fines lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> it irritates my sensitive eyes</li>
    <li> Love it!  Make up goes on so nice!</li>
    <li> Not sparkly fortunately.</li>
    <li> I love this product I saw instant results. I never want to be without it. Its not greasy which I have found in some other eye creams.  I&#x27;m not sure if I should be wearing it at night but I have been.</li>
    <li> Nothing to write except it did not do anything. Rather disappointing after reading about its &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; ability to smooth lines.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Truly helps with my dark circles and leaves such a soft silky feeling on skin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work all that well, despite claims.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this actually works as well as it does. My problem has always been dark circles and bags under my eyes. A swipe of this product and they&#x27;re practically invisible. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about a week now and have  definitely noticed a difference around my eyes.  Will continue to use.</li>
