      <li>too oily for my scalp, but really is fantastic for skin softening on my legs, heels and elbows.</li>
      <li>The smell of the real tea tree oil is very strong.  </li>
      <li>This is the saddest excuse for a &amp;#34;tea tree oil&amp;#34; product I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
      <li>I clean my feet with fungasoap twice a day and cover my feet with tea tree oil twice a day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also really great after a shower or bath for dry itchy skin.</li>
      <li>It has other good ingredients to promote healthy skin and scalp.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is not PURE Tea Tree Oil although the label doesn&#x27;t say so. It&#x27;s a blend of 20 different oils and extracts, good ones however the misleading label might cause someone with peanut allergies to use it.  The main ingredient, listed first, is soybean oil.  Along with tea tree oil it also contains, peanut oil, safflower oil and sunflower oil!  It may be a good product but the labeling should say &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; and that it contains peanut oil.  I&#x27;m surprised USDA has not required this.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Started working on scalp first attempt itself.  Looks good for now.</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil to treat a dry scalp. This one was priced nicely. The bottle cap and the way the spout opens makes it impossible to get just a little out. Any tilt will cause the oil to pour voluminously. It&#x27;s a rather cheap plastic bottle and the oil itself is a bit thin. I wanted to try it but won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Not 100% tea tree oil. I buy the 100% Australian kind and dilute it with this as a carrier oil. Great combo. Even when used by itself, it&#x27;s great for toe fungus, clearing up psoriasis, eczema, and also as a great skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My head is still flaky and itchy</li>
    <li> I like this product and I have noticed an improvement in the condition of my skin.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for a while. I really do love it for my dry scalp. Which it works really well. I have severe dandruff and for a little bottle of tree tea oil. Wasn&#x27;t going to cut it. I would ran out within a week. So I ended up being coconut oil. Which works just the same and get so much more for my buck. One thing i also used tree tea oil for is acne scars. Let me tell you it work great. Within a few days I notice acne scars seem to fade away quickly. Definitely worth buying if you have acne scars.</li>
    <li> Yup, Its a good oil. Not a very strong scent but it works well.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for a super- annoying itch &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; caused by non-cotton underwear? perspiring too much in the groin? wearing pajamas instead of a nightgown? nutritional yeast? or a combination of all the above.  Whatever! ---it worked!!! Have it on hand just in case again.</li>
    <li> the main ingedient is soybean oil. does not even smell like tea tree oil. i&#x27;ve done my own low-concentration tea tree oil dilutions and they still smell like tea tree oil. how low of a concentration is in this one??</li>
    <li> This product should be promoted for scalp psoriasis sufferers. I have spent hundreds of dollars on trips to the dermatologist and messy steriod creams and sprays for my scalp. On a whim I tried this product as my scalp psoriasis has started to spread and out of desperation. Unbelievable results in just 1 over night application. I soaked my scalp and wore a shower cap to bed. Washed my hair like normal when I woke up and I am completely itch free. I would say with just 1 application my scalp is 75% better. I cant wait to apply it again tonight and see the results tomorrow!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Will certainly buy again!</li>
    <li> My son has super dry skin and Excema. He uses this in between using the cream the doctor gave him. It helps the itchy so much. He uses it all over. Which is nice because the cream he can only use twice a day. This stuff he can put on five times a day and it won&#x27;t cause any type of an issues. My 11 year old son has had really bad Excema since he was 5. This was not only the least inexpensive stuff this is the only one that didn&#x27;t burn. Thank God it was easy to afford and a good size bottle! He is almost cleared up now, but even when he used it everyday it lasted him about 6-8 weeks. Really worth it. So happy we found this product in this size bottle. The stores only carry 4 ounce bottles.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I would have like, but at least no horrible odor.</li>
    <li> The strength of tea tree oil in this bottle is not enough. I have a small bottle of tea tree oils bought on Amazon and I add extra tea tree oil into this bottle. Now the concentration of tea tree oil is just right and I use this oil as my primary moisturizer for this long harsh winter. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I read some good and bad reviews on this, but I thought I would still give it a shot. I used it on my face (acne prone skin) and I thought it would work greatly considering it has such amazing oils in it such tea tree and vitamin A etc. However, it didn&#x27;t seem to absorb fast or help with my acne. I only use it on my scalp and feet now.</li>
    <li> Great buy for a great product!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I used it for scalp, skin, nails, you name it! Not too oily, sits on skin well and has a really great feel. Plus natural anti-fungal properties!</li>
    <li> Tea tree is my favorite oil. This is a product every one should have at home, and I recommend it</li>
    <li> I had psoriasis on my scalp and this cleared it right up. Now I use it for lots of things!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good massager oil, but the scent is very mild...more like mint.</li>
    <li> I have short, almost shaved hair. My scalp gets very dry and itchy. this is a thick oil with a nice lemony scent. Not too medicinal smelling. This clears the itchiness and moisturizes well. I do have to reapply throughout the day, but less often than I would have to with plain baby oil. also works better at eliminating itchiness than plain baby oil does. My scalp is itchy because it it dry, not because I have dandruff or some other curable affliction. This is why I reapply perpetually  several times a day, as opposed to being able to simply cure it. Good product for what I need.</li>
    <li> Nice size bottle worth the price.</li>
    <li> I put this on a scratch and never saw anything heal so fast.  Since I have pets... scratches are common and this has been great.  Never saw anything heal so quickly with little on no scabbing.  I know that is not what it is normally used for but....... I is a great product for skin and scalp obviously.  I have purchased 5 bottles... 2 for me and 3 for family... they love it too.</li>
    <li> It smells like cooking oil. I used it daily on my hands and feet to sleep with sox with plans to soften my skin, but after two weeks, nothing has changed, skin seems to be better without it.</li>
    <li> My toddler has terrible dandruff and eczema and has since birth, now at 16 months, I have tried everything from oils to soaps, I use this product after shampooing with organic shampoo to eliminate dandruff and relieve eczema from the nape of his neck. It has a strong tea tree odor, but works great! I usually put a small amount in my hand after his bath while his hair is still wet and massage it into his scalp, it relieves itching, and makes his hair soft while eliminating dandruff. It does not make his hair greasy, only a small amount is needed, when I am done massaging it into his hair I dry his hair with a towel, and his hair looks shiny all day and does not feel greasy. He also gets a patch of eczema at the nape of his neck that he constantly scratches Since putting this oil in his hair after his bath, he has not been scratching, and his skin looks great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A negative aspect of the product would be it can burn the eyes if it gets in the eyes, or open areas of the skin. I had put it on my toddler in the bath and rinsed it when his dandruff was bad, and I noticed my daughter (his twin) would not sit in the bathtub as it caused irritation/burning to her peri/vaginal area, so if you are putting it on a girl, don&#x27;t do it while still in the bath apply after just to hair</li>
    <li> Husband uses this for his dandruff and itchy scalp as recommended by our hairdresser. Completely solves both issues for him. Finally he gets relief after 40 years with this problem. Love love love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this. Very good to use for a number of things. Also love that this is a bigger bottle than what I see inside stores.</li>
    <li> I have very severe seborrheic dermatitis and with continued use of this product I&#x27;ve seen my condition improve significantly over month I&#x27;ve been using it so far.</li>
    <li> Size and price better than anything I can find locally. This product of very high grade tea tree oil and the healing and relief for my psoriasis from it is critical to my remissions.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is much different from any other tea tree oil product I&#x27;ve used before. I don&#x27;t especially care for it, but it really isn&#x27;t offensive in any way. It&#x27;s sweeter, lighter, hard for me to put a finger on it. Not the smell I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer remarked, it is difficult to get just a small amount of this product out at a time, you always get more than you wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, a decent product, seems to work just fine.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find a bottle this size.  I use it for many things that people have already suggested here.  This is a great value. I regularly use it on my feet after showering.  I travel a lot for work so I&#x27;m always worried about fungus.  This keeps my feet beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t get an anti-fungal cream for a price like this, plus it&#x27;s so versatile.</li>
    <li> Works great, takes the itch away from my scalp; soothes my scalp.</li>
    <li> No complaints from me .It is a good value and tea tree oil with its wide variety of uses is always a winner to me. I will cotinue buying this item.</li>
    <li> This has tea tree oil in it but it is not 100% tea tree oil. It has other good ingredients to promote healthy skin and scalp. If you&#x27;re trying to kill fungus then look for 100% pure tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> works great to sooth my feet and prevent from fungus!</li>
    <li> I actually first purchased this product at CVS. It&#x27;s not all Tea Tree Oil and contains parabens, so I was a little hesitant. I have had horrid rosacea for years and have tried everything… sulfur soaps, Finacea, one round of laser treatment, Metrocream, Metrogel gel, Adoxa oral antibiotics, Sumaxin. Finacea worked the best with Skinoran being the only affordable way to get Azelaic acid. Otherwise is is $200 a tube/month. Not covered by insurance, in fact, none of it is. All of it runs from $200-$600/month. Laser isn&#x27;t covered b/c it&#x27;s considered cosmetic. SOOOOOO….. I had heard for years that demodex mites test to favor people with rosacea and if you treat them (easily with tea tree oil) the symptoms of welts, pustules and breakouts will be reduced. Totally grossed out that there may be freakin&#x27; mites on my face I bought this. Three drops in the morning, three drops at night. Amazing!!!!! I don&#x27;t use anything else. I will be looking for a new non-paraben product soon, or mixing my own with a local soap maker&#x27;s oil and tea tree oil. Seriously, try it for your rosacea!!!! I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long!</li>
    <li> Best hair product I have used. It got rid of all the dry scalp issues I have had and makes my hair look shiny. I&#x27;m a dude and used to have bad dandruff before I started using this product. It definitely helps get the ladies.</li>
    <li> My three year old suffers with eczema and we have spent many hundreds of dollars on creams, oils, ointments, lotions.  We just tried it on his most recent flare, and wow did it help!  He got a very dry scalp (and all over too) so at bath time I put this on like a shampoo but left it on overnight and actually until his bath the next night.  His dry scalp dramatically improved.  I also slathered his skin in this before getting him out the tub (everywhere) and applied our usual moisturizing ointment over the top.  Tucked him in and the morning he was a new (and a little greasy!) kiddo.  Amazing results and finally some relief for the little guy. I will totally be stocking up on this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of a scalp rash I had been experiencing.  It seemed to irritate my skin.  I might use it for other things as the occasion arises, but not for the scalp.</li>
    <li> Not very happy. The ingredients were not listed and there are nut products in it. If you have a severe allergies to nuts, do NOT get this product.</li>
    <li> I had bought a bottle years ago from Target or another retailer for mild acne. Now I use it for dandruff, as I&#x27;ve been getting it pretty bad even with using Head &amp; Shoulders to fight it. This stuff did an amazing job! I apply it after taking a shower to my scalp and massage it in, then just style my hair like normal. I heard there is a new formula, but not sure how good it is.</li>
    <li> This is not tea tree oil.  This company should not sell this oil as tea tree oil.  The smell of the real tea tree oil is very strong.  Buy a smaller bottle of the real thing instead of a larger one of the fake thing.</li>
    <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very rich blend. Works extremely well and is a great lice preventative</li>
    <li> Works for numerous things but I use it at the base of toenails to clear up fungal infections.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I got my order of Hollywood Beauty Tea Tree Oil in record time. It smells great. My kids don&#x27;t mind having it on their scalps. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I use this oil everyday after I shower.  Mixed with your favorite body lotion makes a great &amp;#34;disinfectant&amp;#34;...great product, great price.</li>
    <li> My skin in the winter itches so bad that I have made myself bleed in the past. I started using this and noticed a difference after the first day. A week later and the itching is completely gone. I have tried so many products over the years and nothing worked until now. This stuff has given my sanity back!!</li>
    <li> Next person who uses the toilet will appreciate you.</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction quality item.</li>
    <li> Because this product is so weak. Its like pure vegetable oil. Last year I was buying thisvalong w/ Walgreens &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Tea Tree oil just to have something to dilute it with and make the real deal stretch.. I swear I can&#x27;t believe how vulnerable Amazon customers have gotten. I mean come on ppls ..look at the name of the company. They arent very bright. Not to be to out spoken but obviously they were targeting those lacking a social life in the suburbs &amp; *cough* country bumpkins :(  Smell the coffee all ..Wake UP</li>
    <li> I am loving this oil. I use it mixed with almond oil for a scalp treatment. It&#x27;s also really great after a shower or bath for dry itchy skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged guy with chronic, mild facial skin problems (rosacea-like redness and roughness, further irritated by shaving).  Prescription Metrogel provides only partial relief.  I find tea tree oil soaps, and this lotion, help as much, if not more, for a fraction of the cost, and leave my skin feeling and looking much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When shaving, I slather the tea tree oil product on, then apply shave cream over it.  The result is much less irritation, no nicks, a very close shave, and really soft, smooth feeling skin.  And the typical blotchy redness and blemishes I frequently was bothered by are about 75% diminished.  I use it more generally as a moisturiser/remedy for dry, irritated, rough, or scaly skin conditions anywhere, always with at least some, if not a lot, of improvement.  So I&#x27;m very pleased.  Some folks seem sensitive to the fragrance.  I find it slight, and not unpleasant---sort of earthy and herbaceous.  It doesnt linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked one star because the dispensing spout is a bit crude and messy, but that&#x27;s minor.  This lotion is quite greasy, and doesn&#x27;t disappear via absorption,but the excess wipes off easily.  Bottom line, results are great.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I had terrible problems with the skin on my arms.  This helped to heal the sore and my skin is much less fragile now.  I love the product!</li>
    <li> I used this as an ingredient to make baby wipes. Item is as described.  Good price!  It lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is not pure Tea Tree Oil but that&#x27;s good for me. Pure TTO is just too strong for me to use. This way I can use it on my face, skin, on my daughter acne, excezma and itching. I use it on my scalp after I dye my hair and it stops the itching. Spot treatment on acne and on bug bites sends those bumps away. I&#x27;m content with the smell too. Its milder than the pure so it&#x27;s easier on my nasal passages. The pure tends to burn the inside of my nose.</li>
    <li> We love this product.. First found it at the dollar tree...use it for dry skin and rashes.</li>
    <li> Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Everything is oily.. Nice!</li>
    <li> I have a scalp problem, and it has worsened. BUT THIS IS THE SAVIOR. All I have to do is put some on a cotton swab and dab it on my scalp and forehead, and I can remain relatively clear of problems. I should buy some more</li>
    <li> I have dry scalp and i used this oil because it was said that it removes it... So i put it on during the night and i wrapped my hair and OMG ... The next morning, my dry scalp had gotten WORSE!! I was so embarrassed even to leave the house for work because my hair line had soooo much flakes! BIG old nasty ones... I will never use this product again! Maybe it was an allergic reaction? Everyone else said it worked ... sigh ... everyone isnt the same. That was me.. if you&#x27;re thinking about getting it then u should ... maybe it will work for u</li>
    <li> They changed the formula about a year ago and the newer product just isn&#x27;t as strong as the older one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few suggestions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)Makes sense to purchase the 8 oz version of the product rather than the smaller bottle , the 8 ounce bottle labeled with large  \\&quot;33% free\\&quot; graphic on the label&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)The older more effective formula has slightly different package than the newer one. The original version has the \\&quot;33% \\&quot; in BROWN letters... and the word \\&quot;FREE\\&quot; in BLACK letters the new one has \\&quot;33%\\&quot; in BLACK letters and the word \\&quot;FREE\\&quot; in BROWN letters. The amazon image for this product is the NEWER package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)Original formula, in addition to doing all the things that the label describes....is also a VERY effective bug repellant. If you do yard work....rubbing this on your exposed body parts will almost completely keep bugs from biting you or even flying around you. Pure tea tree oil might be more effective but this oil has a pleasant scent and is blended with other oils that seem to be good for your skin.Newer formula doesn&#x27;t repel bugs one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)Original formula REALLY fights foot,toe, hand fungus and skin problems...new formula is much less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) I initially contacted Hollywood Beauty to determine whether or not my issues with the newer formula were based on a defective bottle, the store selling possible bootleg version, or something else and the never got back to me. I noticed that the older packaging was different , so I just made a point to buy a case of the older formula(label) because the new one is completely an inferior version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest you contact vendor, specifically ask them about the labeling BEFORE you spend your money.&lt;br /&gt;Newer formula is inferior.</li>
    <li> This product cured the itchy, scaly seborrheic dermatitis that had plagued me for 18 years.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  I had tried all of the medicated shampoos and other ointments, and this is the only thing that worked.  A hairdresser recommended tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> it is oily and  a little tea tree oil, though the bottle is big and there is a lot inside the bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this all over my body even in my hair.. love the tingle feeling it give you.</li>
    <li> good stuff bought a small bottle from target for about 3 bux and got 2 bigger 8 oz bottles on amazon. Its not ALL tea tree oil but the additives it&#x27;s got actually enhance the oil for your skin. Main ingredient is Tea Tree still so I&#x27;m glad about that. If you like tea tree oil you should at least give this a try once. get the 2 oz size first it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> I actually got this as an unexpected bonus and I actually like it. I use it on my hair and scalp instead of conditioner and it works well.</li>
    <li> Nice product - but it leaked on delivery! The top did not have any seal on it. Little scared to order again!!</li>
    <li> Great for using on your itchy scalp after all its moisture has been stripped from a clarifying shampoo. It made an immediate impact after itching was driving me crazy.</li>
    <li> We have found that this stuff works for fungal foot issues too. We&#x27;ve tried a number of different things and this is the best.</li>
    <li> Great for any skin issue.  In fact this magical product accomplished what a steroid cream could not do for body dandruff and redness.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I have found at a reasonable price that completely clears up my dandruff. Just be careful when applying, it&#x27;s pretty easy to use too much and have greasy hair.</li>
    <li> Nice to use and makes your hair and skin nourish.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my scalp to soothe the itching and never notice that it can be used to fight fungus. I was not happy with the use on my scalp and sought out another product. Curious as to how it would treat fungus and starting applying it to my feet. I would say i have severe athletes foot. Flakey skin on heel and bottom of foot and possible nail fungus on big toe but not real bad nail fungus. I do use the products recomended by the foot doctor in the summer but it gets costly and you have to be consistent. So in the winter I let it go, but I needed something for the dryness and flakeness of my feet. I have been using this tea tree oil for a month and I am very pleased with the results. I clean my feet with fungasoap twice a day and cover my feet with tea tree oil twice a day. I gave it 5 stars because I got great results with using two products. I was using fungasoap, pedifix tea tree soaking crystals( soaking twice-three times a week) and a dr. recommended antifungal foot cream. Now i am down to two products and getting way better results. This will be my winter regimen from now on and it cost minimal which helps my pocketbook. I hope this helps someone that is experincing the same problem.</li>
    <li> Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair look and feel greasy so I don&#x27;t use it on my scalp, but I imagine if you don&#x27;t mind the look and feeling it would work well. However, I do use it on my face for a moisturizer in the shower and that works nicely.</li>
    <li> I tried other products without success, but this oil solved my scalp problems quickly and easily. I had patches of dry, itchy, and flaking skin on my scalp. When I started using this oil on a daily basis I noticed a dramatic improvement in only 2 days. My scalp was clear in a little over a week. As noted by others, the dispenser cap is a bit messy, but not unmanageable. Just be careful, and have a tissue handy to wipe up drips.</li>
    <li> I love a good body oil/lotion/cream that will moisturize your skin without leaving you feeling oily. It has a minty scent and it goes on really smooth! I use it for my hair, skin and on my face.</li>
    <li> I was recommended to use tea tree oil by a hair dresser who said my scalp looked red and irritated. I mix this with my conditioner and have noticed a big impovement on my hair and scalp. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love it glad I found the site for this oil</li>
    <li> it moisturizes the scalp well. doesnt help with the scabbing much but keeps my head feeling all tingly. would buy again</li>
    <li> I have a dual use for this. 1st use - Use an eye dropper to apply quite a few drops to scalp for mild scalp psoriasis. It causes a &#x27;wet&#x27; hair look. I let it soak in scalp and hair overnight before washing. 2nd use - put a couple of drops on my hands and then run fingers through hair. This works like a hair conditioner and styling gel. Hair gets a nice shine,smell and adds body. Much better than a shower hair conditioner. Haven&#x27;t had any scalp problems since I started using it!</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.  Tried the 2 oz bottle from walmart and ordered the larger better value bottle here.  I don&#x27;t want to be messing around mixing pure essential oils in some sort carrier, I like that they took care of that for me.  I massage this into my feet after showering at the gym.  I used to be concerned about picking up some sort of foot fungus at the gym, and am still careful about where I walk barefoot.  At worst it makes my feet feel nice and has softened my calluses and improved the feel of the skin between my toes.  Maybe any oil would have done that, but this stuff isn&#x27;t too greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.  I put it on a razor burn rash on my leg for a couple days and it cleared it up.  Now I am adding a few drops to my body lotion and it seems to help keep my skin from dryng out as quickly. Tried the carrot oil but this smells better and absorbs better.  All around I am happy with the product and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Came in a messy container; it was obvious the oil had been leaking.  Also, doesn&#x27;t have as much actual tea tree oil in the ingredients as one would expect.</li>
    <li> Great product just a little messy.  Leaks from the top and gets all over the place after time.</li>
    <li> i love it  thank you very much</li>
    <li> For some reason this larger size has an odd smell compared to the ones that I buy at my local pharmacy?  I need to use more to get the same result and the odd odor lingers.  Perhaps this had something to do with it shipping during the warm weather?  Not sure, but I will stick to buying locally in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the saddest excuse for a &amp;#34;tea tree oil&amp;#34; product I&#x27;ve ever experienced. My guess is, in an 8 oz. container, you are getting 7.99 oz. soybean oil and 0.01 oz. tea tree oil (and other essential oils). It&#x27;s just expensive, vaguely pleasant smelling, soybean oil.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out as a scalp conditioner. I just kept squirting it on, then squirting on some more, until my head was an oily mess. I left it on for about 20 minutes with not even the barest tingle that you expect from tea tree oil. Three shampooings later, I finally had it all out of my hair, with absolutely nothing to show for my efforts. This product is so terrible it seems fraudulent for the manufacturer to use the words &amp;#34;tea tree oil&amp;#34; so prominently on the label.</li>
    <li> Does the job, not a great smell but I suppose that&#x27;s not really the point. Might want to buy a smaller bottle the first time around, I&#x27;ll be using this stuff for a long time!</li>
    <li> I did not read the details of this product. I thought that it was actual tea tree oil only, but I was mistaken. When it shipped to me, the oil was spilling out a bit, and I didn&#x27;t particularly like how it smelled. Next time, I will not be cheap and I will just purchase the real thing. I did not open this oil. I returned it as it was sent to me.</li>
    <li> too oily for my scalp, but really is fantastic for skin softening on my legs, heels and elbows. A little goes a LONG way.</li>
    <li> I use this to try and keep the skin under my beard from flaking as it is prone to do in the winter.  I use a shaving soap brush to apply a few drops of the tea tree oil.  It&#x27;s very oily as expected and will rub off onto hands, phones, etc if touched within a few hours after application.</li>
    <li> I love it has so many uses</li>
    <li> The potency seems a bit lacking on this product, it doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34;/refreshing effect I&#x27;ve felt from other Tea Tree oils. It may be good for other uses but for what I wanted it for (dry scalp) it wasnt really helping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m saying I love it but really I don&#x27;t know.  My son confiscated the bottle.  He has psoriasis in his scalp and he loves this.  I guess I should buy 2 bottles so we both can have a bottle.</li>
    <li> Wonderful healing properties</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005B0XL6E HOLLYWOOD BEAUTY Tea Tree Oil Skin &amp; Scalp Treatment 8 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product for my wife&#x27;s aching feet. Five minutes with afew drops in hot water. She loves this product</li>
    <li> What can say about this product not to much it&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not good either so you have to do you on this one.</li>
    <li> I love it. Got more than I expected. Should last 30-50% longer, I am happy.</li>
    <li> I have had itchy patches on my scalp for years and years.  Teatree oil has ended most of the patches, and this product, with the other beneficial oils in it, are keeping my scalp healthy and hair looking better than it has look for a long time.  It also leaves your nails and cuticals in great shape, and also skin in general.  It does not smell as strongly as pure Teatree oil and skins into the skin better.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of tea tree oil and love this particular brand. Tea tree oil has so many purposes and I love using it as a natural remedy. This particular brand adds some other essential oils such as vitamin E that really make this product a winner. I&#x27;ve has problems with dandruff in the past and adding this to my hair care regime has worked wonders. If you have small kids who are prone to ringworms this product can be used to treat that as well since tea tree oil works as an anti fungal.</li>
