      <li>Just perfect for picking locks.</li>
      <li>The value was great.  </li>
      <li>These have held up great, though, and I pick them as my &amp;#34;primary&amp;#34;</li>

      <li>and these are by far the best, tightest fitting bobby pins that I have tried.</li>
      <li>Very secure.</li>
      <li>If I used bobby pins, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d love these.  </li>
      <li>Love these bobby pins...</li>
      <li>I will probably replace with a better brand that has more of a rubberized tip.</li>
      <li>So I guess what more could you ask for ?</li>
      <li>but they just hold hair in place like magic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m inclined to say I love this purchase and product.</li>
      <li>what more can I say.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good, no complaints</li>
      <li>I bought these at the recommendation that they&#x27;re the &amp;#34;only bobby pin worth using.&amp;#34;  Although they&#x27;re better than Goody brand, they&#x27;re not as amazing as I thought they&#x27;d be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And they&#x27;re so cheap</li>
      <li>These stay secure no matter what.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>They are great for long hair</li>
      <li>These hold my thick, but fine hair perfectly!</li>
      <li>They shipped quickly and where cheap.</li>
      <li>I love these bobby pins; they are so much stronger than the higher-priced pins you get at the drugstore.....</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see how they are any better than any other cheap brand.</li>
      <li>Love the bronze color for my medium blonde hair.</li>
      <li>These pins really do blend well with brunette colored hair.  </li>
      <li>They really do hold well because they are not coated so they&#x27;re not &amp;#34;slippery.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>They work on my fine hair that other pins (I&#x27;m looking at you Goody) slide right out of no matter how much hairspray I use.</li>
      <li>These pins truly are better than any other I have purchased.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these bobby pins as opposed to the cheap pins I formerly bought at the drug store.</li>
      <li>I was so tired of &#x27;drugstore&#x27; quality pins so am delighted that these hold as they should and can be used over and over with never fail results.</li>
      <li>They do break a little bit too easy at first though.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I thought it was normal to spend $5 for just one card of bobby pins, but for some reason that is what I was expecting - I don&#x27;t think it says anywhere that this order is for twelve cards of bobby pins, with 60 pins on each card.  </li>
      <li>glad I only spent $2 on them.</li>
      <li>These are a must for updos or anytime you really want your hair secured back!</li>
      <li>They still hold tightly, but I&#x27;m going to need to find a replacement quickly because they hurt to put in.</li>
      <li>Not sure how they handle with hair though, I would bet they are as amazing as any other hairpin.</li>
      <li>They hold my long hair very well when I create an updo.</li>
      <li>I reordered another pack of these, since my first ones were dwindling down from use (stretched out/crossing tips), but this pack was NOT made well -</li>

<li> /&gt;They don&#x27;t recover from use very well, meaning they stretch out and are pretty much useless after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> High quality and tight to do the job!</li>

<li> The item description is a little confusing as to the color, but they are bronze which is the color I wanted for my brown hair.  </li>
<li> 5 stars - I&#x27;ve bought some cheaper store-brand pins in the past, and I eventually have to cull through them to throw out ones that widen out from use.</li>
<li> I was referred to these by Kate from The Small Things Blog.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed with rubber tips as they felt sharp and could dig into my head.  </li>
<li> the rubber tips on the longer end were practically gone (mis-manufactured), so they&#x27;re now painful to use.</li>
<li> So disappointed!</li>

    <li> These pins really do blend well with brunette colored hair.  Holds tight throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and these are by far the best, tightest fitting bobby pins that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Very secure. Stay in place. I should have looked to see if they bobby pins come in a darker color, they don&#x27;t camouflage well with brown hair.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, no complaints</li>
    <li> Love these bobby pins... hope they last longer than Goody brand...</li>
    <li> The value was great.  They are sturdy and look good.  I have had no problems with these bobby pins in the 3 days I have had them.</li>
    <li> I used these bobby pins to hold back hair under a wig.  I was very disappointed with rubber tips as they felt sharp and could dig into my head.  They are still usable as long as I position them correctly.  I will probably replace with a better brand that has more of a rubberized tip.</li>
    <li> Just perfect for picking locks. Would definitely recommend to anyone that is trying to learn how to pick locks. They do break a little bit too easy at first though. Not sure how they handle with hair though, I would bet they are as amazing as any other hairpin.</li>
    <li> If I used bobby pins, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d love these.  They seem to hold my wife&amp;#34;s very thick hair very well.  So I guess what more could you ask for ?</li>
    <li> Got these after hearing them hyped on a hair and makeup blog.  They really do hold well because they are not coated so they&#x27;re not &amp;#34;slippery.&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t find any breakage with them either.  And they&#x27;re so cheap, why wouldn&#x27;t you try some?</li>
    <li> These pins truly are better than any other I have purchased. They hold my long hair very well when I create an updo.</li>
    <li> High quality and tight to do the job! I was so tired of &#x27;drugstore&#x27; quality pins so am delighted that these hold as they should and can be used over and over with never fail results. Very happy I found these. I have long hair and it&#x27;s heavy when put up. These do the trick!</li>
    <li> They are bobby pins....what more can I say.  They shipped quickly and where cheap.</li>
    <li> Saw review of bobby pins on beauty blog. Gave them a try. They really hold, and I have thick curly hair. Recommend them.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were recommended. I don&#x27;t see how they are any better than any other cheap brand.</li>
    <li> These are the best bobby pins out there. They work on my fine hair that other pins (I&#x27;m looking at you Goody) slide right out of no matter how much hairspray I use. These stay secure no matter what. Love the bronze color for my medium blonde hair.</li>
    <li> Love these!  Work better than any others out there!</li>
    <li> These are a must for updos or anytime you really want your hair secured back! I don&#x27;t know what it is about them but they just hold hair in place like magic. I was referred to these by Kate from The Small Things Blog. Definitely worth it!</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I thought it was normal to spend $5 for just one card of bobby pins, but for some reason that is what I was expecting - I don&#x27;t think it says anywhere that this order is for twelve cards of bobby pins, with 60 pins on each card.  Suffice it to say that I will officially have enough bobby pins to pin my daughter&#x27;s ballet buns until she is 30.</li>
    <li> Lousy: cheaply made, thin material and the two prongs cross over each other.</li>
    <li> I love these bobby pins; they are so much stronger than the higher-priced pins you get at the drugstore.....over and over each time of use.</li>
    <li> They are great for long hair***</li>
    <li> These pins do what they&#x27;re supposed to do!  Highly recommend.  I&#x27;m throwing all my Walmart ones away.  These hold my thick, but fine hair perfectly!</li>
    <li> 5 stars - I&#x27;ve bought some cheaper store-brand pins in the past, and I eventually have to cull through them to throw out ones that widen out from use. These have held up great, though, and I pick them as my &amp;#34;primary&amp;#34; pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED SEPT 2015 - 3 STARS: I reordered another pack of these, since my first ones were dwindling down from use (stretched out/crossing tips), but this pack was NOT made well - the rubber tips on the longer end were practically gone (mis-manufactured), so they&#x27;re now painful to use. They still hold tightly, but I&#x27;m going to need to find a replacement quickly because they hurt to put in. So disappointed!</li>
