      <li>No orange just a nice sun kissed look!</li>
      <li>Good stuff for the price.</li>
      <li>That was a good choice.  </li>
      <li>The price is really good</li>
      <li>Based on my skin color, I felt either fair/medium or medium/tan could be a good choice.</li>
      <li>I just used a bronzer instead and was good</li>
      <li>so I knew I was going to need a good self tanner.  </li>
      <li>I have very fair skin but after reading the reviews for the Suave Professionals Gradual Self Tanner in the Light.</li>
      <li>I got this as a way of evening and expanding my tan zone and for that purpose I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>(If you like a colored bronzer, check out Banana Boat (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7PPNI/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1); Banana Boat is great too, but a bit messier and requires a bit more time.  </li>
      <li>I especially liked how it didn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky in bed after putting it on right before bed.</li>
      <li>I love how nice it made my legs look !&lt;</li>
      <li>and I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Also, it was a nice lotion for post-shower or when waking up.  </li>
      <li>This one in my opinion smelled kind of like paste, but maybe I&#x27;m being finicky and that won&#x27;t bother us.  </li>
      <li>The gradual aspect would be nice</li>
      <li>After about 3-4 days, my co-workers started mentioning what a nice tan I had.  </li>
      <li>I love a good tanned skin--even better when I can just apply a lotion.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>The best daily moisturizer with a hint of tint (that deepens NATURALLY and WONDERFULLY over the course of three days) on the market.</li>
      <li>but my legs are very light at the start of summer.</li>
      <li>This is a nice summer lotion alternative if you want an easy way to enhance your tan.</li>
      <li>love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>favorite self tanner is by Ocean Potion.</li>
      <li>I love this product - used to use the St. Tropez gradual self tanner/moisturizer at $36 a bottle for 1/2 this quantity.</li>
      <li>, I figured I better try to get it all of.</li>
      <li>, if not there are better ones on the market.</li>
      <li>I was hoping that gradual tan aspect would minimize the amount of streaking I experienced but it didn&#x27;t really.</li>
      <li>I just love it. .</li>
      <li>I do notice an odor through out the day (didn&#x27;t notice an odor with the Jergens) which makes me use sparingly &amp; not an \\&quot;all over everyday\\&quot; body lotion as I was able to do with the Jergans self tanning.</li>
      <li>Most of us want a self tanner that doesn&#x27;t look orange and gives us just a bit of sun-kissed skin.</li>
      <li>and I will be purchasing more as the summer season goes on.</li>
      <li>and I took care to make sure it didn&#x27;t get on my clothes.</li>
      <li>The color is light and It blends nicely.</li>
      <li>You just have to make sure you apply it evenly.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure to spread it on evenly</li>
      <li>Especially for a Suave brand product, this is one of the best.</li>
      <li>the after scent could be removed I would love the product</li>
      <li>My \\&quot;tan\\&quot; came in quick... and lovely !</li>
      <li>The first day I used it, I could see color by the evening, so that was good.</li>
      <li>It is nice to use if you have an event to go to and want some quick color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Suave tanner gets 3 stars because it does develop a good color quickly and can be used as a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>tanner is easy to apply, and smooths into my skin easily.  </li>
      <li>The stink sticks to clothes but can be easily washed out.</li>
      <li>This is a easy to apply self tanner.  </li>
      <li>product is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Goes on easy with a very light scent and dries quickly, meaning you don&#x27;t have to put it on and</li>
      <li>At first, I liked this self tanner.</li>
      <li>and you should be fine.  </li>
      <li>which is a huge plus.  </li>
      <li>This goes on great, smells fresh and offers me a gradual glow.</li>
      <li>tanner smells great and the scent almost dissipates entirely after it absorbs into your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this works for you, fantastic</li>
      <li>I did like the color after a week, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it when there are better ones out there.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important to kep in mind</li>
      <li>I always exfoliate in the shower and put a light moisturizer on first...and then apply the self tanner all over, even my face.  </li>
      <li>The product itself has a light fragrance and has a smooth, silky texture.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and creamy, I wear gloves when I apply it.</li>
      <li>It comes in a huge bottle with a pump and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s important to divulge.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s from Suave, they produce pretty good products for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I am pretty fair skinned, but always buy the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; versions of self tanners because the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; versions never seem to produce much color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Spend the extra dollars and go with the better brand to see better results!</li>
      <li>It was easier because this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve used self-tanners and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the fact that it tends to look more blotchy for a while</li>
      <li>You really need more than that even if you have applied it lightly.</li>
      <li>It goes on easy but can leave splotches if not applies right.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps I put on more in certain spots than others?  </li>
      <li>If I wanted to have a gorgeous tan for a special occasion I would definitely use this for that.</li>
      <li>and I love gradual tanners for subtlety, but you can&#x27;t really compare it to St. Tropez.  </li>
      <li>and if you&#x27;re trying to move a couple shades - watch for streaking and make sure you really blend it</li>
      <li>Overall though a good tanner but may try out a lighter one than this medium tan.</li>
      <li>I can also safely say it didn&#x27;t streak, but that&#x27;s also because it didn&#x27;t really work for</li>
      <li>My skin looked natural and felt nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is sorta DHA reacting with skin, but not bad at all.  </li>
      <li>It works extremely well, smells great, moisturizes well, produces nice, natural looking color quickly and will not get blotchy/scrub off.</li>
      <li>Self tanners promise much;  natural, healthy color without the danger of UV light.</li>
      <li>Use it lightly and sparingly and evening at first.</li>
      <li>However, it goes on skin smelling nice but as the tan develops later on it starts to stink like a true self tanner.</li>
      <li>I tan easily, but have been very diligent about not having a tan for decades.  </li>
      <li>, you must try this one first!  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about trying a self tanner, you must try this one first!  </li>
      <li>A good-quality, cheap, safe way to get a little more color.</li>
      <li>cheapest price I could find and it gives a nice glow to fish belly white skin.</li>
      <li>It is kind of like the knock-off version of the Jergen&#x27;s which I would definitely recommend over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works but skin was fairly white and it did leave a kind of orange tint.  </li>
      <li>color actually develops pretty quickly, which I thought was nice.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As a self-tan junkie I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on the market and I love this stuff! It has a very faint self-tan odor. It really is streak free and develops into a believable tan; nothing orange or weird. I do use this on my face and have had no breakouts. Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> greta stuff, just once and you have color, and twice your legs look awesome!!!!!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it. When the weather turns warmer and you&#x27;re finally able to go outside in shorts, the vivid whiteness of your legs can be a bit embarassing. A good way to add some color to your skin prior to getting it the natural way is to use a product like this. My wife has used self-tanning lotions in the past, though she couldn&#x27;t remember the brands when I asked about them. She did tell me that she likes this lotion etter than the others she has used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to kep in mind that ths IS a gradual tanning lotion. You aren&#x27;t going to get the immediate results that you would see from a spray-on product or one of those unnatural orange-tint lotions that stain your skin and everything that cmes in contact with it. This product isn&#x27;t like that. It works little-by-little as use use it on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most Suave products, the price point is less than most other major brands, which is also a plus. I would recommend this product to those looking for self-tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!!  I just love it. . I use it with disposable gloves to apply after a thorough exfoliation in the bathtub or shower and being dried thoroughly, then don&#x27;t dress for 20 minutes or so until it&#x27;s dried thoroughly, and it gives a noticeable, long-lasting color, at least 4 days.  Careful around your elbows and knees of course like any self-tanner, and exfoliate well.  This is moisturizing.  It does NOT contain any color in it so you CANNOT see where you are applying it, but other than that I just love it.  (If you like a colored bronzer, check out Banana Boat (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7PPNI/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1); Banana Boat is great too, but a bit messier and requires a bit more time.  This Suave Visible Glow is easy for taking in your suitcase for overnight trips and does not require a big production really to apply.  I do recommend using gloves, exfoliating (cannot reiterate enough), and making sure after you remove gloves you put a tiny amount on the backs of your hands for a natural look.  Then hold your palms together, fingers towards drain, and run under a low-pressure faucet to just rinse lightly between fingers and then pat hands dry with a towel.</li>
    <li> This self-tanner does work. You are not going to get the deep brown of a tan that you get laying on a sunbed. This - if you apply it sparingly and gradually does add colour to your skin and takes away that white winter pallor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to follow directions to have it look natural. It needs to be applied daily and smoothly and evenly. The tube says to allow several minutes before dressing. You really need more than that even if you have applied it lightly. I would say 10 minutes is usually the average. It does moisturize your skin which is probably another reason it takes longer to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dressing and pulling clothes over the lotion that is not completely dry can lead to smudging or streaking of the colour.  Thankfully this avoids that awful &#x27;orangeness&#x27; of so many self- tanners.</li>
    <li> This is a easy to apply self tanner.  It goes on easy but can leave splotches if not applies right.  You just have to make sure you apply it evenly.  Works but skin was fairly white and it did leave a kind of orange tint.  It may work a lot better if you are a little darker when you start out.  Overall though a good tanner but may try out a lighter one than this medium tan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other gradual tanning lotions and this is definitely one of the best.  After only one application it was noticeable within three hours, and not in a fake and blotchy or streaky way.  It looked very natural like I&#x27;d been sitting out on the beach and actually got a real tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has no color to it when you&#x27;re applying it.  It&#x27;s absolutely clear which makes it a little more tricky to tell where you&#x27;re putting it.  Just make sure to spread it on evenly and you should be fine.  I had no streaking whatsoever and other than trying to spread it in evenly and going light around ankles and knees I wasn&#x27;t very careful and precise with it at all.  I basically just rubbed it in the way I would regular body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that I don&#x27;t care for the smell.  In the bottle its scent reminds me of shampoo, but once it actually dries on my skin it started to take on a scent I didn&#x27;t care for.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it could be far worse and I&#x27;ve actually had other similar products where the scent was unbearable.  This one in my opinion smelled kind of like paste, but maybe I&#x27;m being finicky and that won&#x27;t bother us.  Either way, I just put my own scented body lotion on overtop it and it mostly covered up the other scent, enough to satisfy me anyway.  I intend to keep on using this and I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have used jergens for years, it was sold out and bought Suave instead, $2.00 cheaper. Suave works better!!&lt;br /&gt;Medium to tan, two times a week on my legs, looks natural and no streaks of Orange.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it gives you a light natural glow that makes it look like you&#x27;d spent a little time in the sun, without that ORANGE factor coming into play. I think medium would fit with most anyone just wanting to look a little healthier. I&#x27;m not sure why we associate a tan with being healthy, but there it is. This has that, &amp;#34;I spend time outdoors look.&amp;#34; without the &amp;#34;I spend WAY too much time outdoors&amp;#34; look some self tanners have. It goes on smooth and creamy, I wear gloves when I apply it. It&#x27;s from Suave, they produce pretty good products for a reasonable price. Long story short, though, you can&#x27;t get Vitamin D from this, so head outside! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several sunless tanners in my past, the Suave Gradual Self Tanner seems to work a lot faster and does not streak nearly as easy as others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one or two applications I noticed  that I looked more tan, TAN, not orange or yellow...which is a huge plus.  So this product definitely does work, just remember to use sparingly and to rub in very well....and wash your hands well after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside...the smell, I simply cannot stand the smell.  It starts off fine, but by the end of the day, I simply do not like the smell of a self tanner, it has improved, but I will not continue to use the product because I have no desire to smell like whatever this stuff leaves you smelling like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the after scent could be removed I would love the product, it&#x27;s not a strong scent so you may not mind, I&#x27;ve never liked the scent of self-tanners, so it bothers me, other than that, I would recommend the product because it really does seem to work.</li>
    <li> Self tanners promise much;  natural, healthy color without the danger of UV light. But frequently they deliver a streaky, blotchy  neon orange glow instead of the desired sun-kissed look. Part of the trick is preparing for application. It helps to shower and exfoliate and apply to completely dry skin.. I use latex gloves to prevent odd colored hands. Putting moisturizer on elbows, ankles and feet protect  against too much color saturation. The product itself has a light fragrance and has a smooth, silky texture. I found using circular strokes prevented streaking.  I noticed a light,natural color after a few days of use with no noticeable streaks. It did not stain my clothes or sheets. My skin looked natural and felt nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works well if you give yourself enough time to prepare. When done correctly, it is a shortcut to a great looking tan.</li>
    <li> The best daily moisturizer with a hint of tint (that deepens NATURALLY and WONDERFULLY over the course of three days) on the market. AND IT DOES NOT SMELL AT ALL!!</li>
    <li> This kind of product can get tricky and annoying at times. It was easier because this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve used self-tanners and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the fact that it tends to look more blotchy for a while and then you can even it up a bit over time. Some of it&#x27;s a matter of paying attention to where you might have used not used enough on previous applications and try to touch it up a little. Over time, most areas average decently well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d go with the lightest version of the product that you think might work for you, because then the mistakes are less visible and you can blend things in more slowly. Results definitely tend to get better with practice, so don&#x27;t use it just a few days before a big date or interview. You might even want to try it out initially in an area you usually keep covered, so that you feel a little more free to experiment without worrying that you&#x27;ll look odd.</li>
    <li> Being of Irish descent, I cannot really get tan. I try sometimes, but that usually fails. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try to see what would happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t get on my sheets and I took care to make sure it didn&#x27;t get on my clothes. I can also safely say it didn&#x27;t streak, but that&#x27;s also because it didn&#x27;t really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have said that this has worked for them. The fact that it didn&#x27;t work for me shouldn&#x27;t condemn the product entirely. But I didn&#x27;t get a visible glow with it and that&#x27;s important to divulge.</li>
    <li> After a day, this will give your skin a glow.  After a week, you&#x27;ll look like you spend a few days bronzing on a beach in the Bahamas.  This lotion goes on evenly and dries quickly without being overly heavy.  I like it and I will be purchasing more as the summer season goes on.</li>
    <li> Most of us want a self tanner that doesn&#x27;t look orange and gives us just a bit of sun-kissed skin. That&#x27;s what this does. If you build it up over several days, it will give you a nice little bit of color. The smell isn&#x27;t severe, as some other tanners are, and I found it very easy to apply. If you are looking for a full-on dark self tanner, keep looking. This look is subtle.</li>
    <li> The price is really good and I love gradual tanners for subtlety, but you can&#x27;t really compare it to St. Tropez.  There is still a smell here and it can go on streaky unless you&#x27;re really careful.  I did like the color after a week, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it when there are better ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently I&#x27;m in love with St. Tropez mouse and my all time favorite is the Vita Liberata 2-3 week tanner (it doesn&#x27;t last that long but there&#x27;s no smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this works for you, fantastic, if not there are better ones on the market. I&#x27;m giving it to a friend</li>
    <li> At first, I liked this self tanner. I have used a lot of different brands over the years from drugstore brands to high end brands, so I was curious to try this one and see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the funky self tanner smell. It is just a very faint scent that it has - sort of floral, but very light and it goes away almost immediately. It isn&#x27;t a very thick lotion and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize that much. It&#x27;s a little watery, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color actually develops pretty quickly, which I thought was nice. I am pretty fair skinned, but always buy the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; versions of self tanners because the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; versions never seem to produce much color. This one won&#x27;t make you orange. The color looks pretty natural, as long as you do not apply it too heavy and too often. The first day I used it, I could see color by the evening, so that was good. It is nice to use if you have an event to go to and want some quick color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like was that when I got a shower, the color ended up very blotchy. I could not scrub it off evenly. I wasn&#x27;t purposely trying to scrub it off at first, but once I noticed that it was coming off in patches, I figured I better try to get it all of. It didn&#x27;t work. I ended up with blotches on my legs and arms. I have used so many different self tanners over the past 20 years and this one ranks pretty low for me as far as that blotchiness. This is not one that I would use regularly. I would only use it if I want a quick fix of color. I do not want to deal with the blotchiness and cannot imagine using it on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Suave tanner gets 3 stars because it does develop a good color quickly and can be used as a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite self tanner is by Ocean Potion. It comes in a huge bottle with a pump and it&#x27;s cheap. It works extremely well, smells great, moisturizes well, produces nice, natural looking color quickly and will not get blotchy/scrub off. I tried that one several years ago and have stuck with it ever since. I have tried new ones as they come along, but I always go back to Ocean Potion. You cannot beat the performance and value of price.several years ago and have stuck with it ever since. I have tried new ones as they come along, but I always go back to Ocean Potion.

    <li> I love a good tanned skin--even better when I can just apply a lotion.  However, after a few uses I noticed tons of streaks and I had thought I rubbed it in well.  Perhaps I put on more in certain spots than others?  So even though I did notice a tan hue, having the random streaks discouraged me from wanting to use the product again!</li>
    <li> I have pale skin with yellow undertones.  I tan easily, but have been very diligent about not having a tan for decades.  Still, sometimes I would like to look like I actually leave my house in the daylight. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a self tanner once before, and not only did it make my skin orange, it smelled SO bad (sort of like Nair) and the smell persisted. I&#x27;m happy to say this product does not have that same weird chemical odor.  AND, I got a nice, subtle, sun-kissed color after two applications.  I didn&#x27;t keep applying it, as recommended, as I didn&#x27;t want to get too dark--plus it&#x27;s a bit time-consuming to apply correctly in order to avoid streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t test this on my face because I&#x27;m acne-prone and have a few areas of flakiness that I was afraid would turn into brown patches.  I just used a bronzer instead and was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims. However it definitly isn&#x27;t like a natural tan. If I wanted to have a gorgeous tan for a special occasion I would definitely use this for that. But for long term it doesn&#x27;t hold up. I used it during the summer and went swimming about a week into it and the stuff just wiped completely off after being in the pool. I was just as pale as before I started using it. So if I&#x27;m just using it for a specific day I know it would be beautiful. The End.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It actually works without any issues. The lotion moisturizes, doesn&#x27;t feel weird, and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. Many tanning lotions have an unpleasant scent. This stuff hardly has any scent, but what is there isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you put it on areas that are very white it is not very visible, but when it is applied to areas that already have some tan, it seems to really bring out and enhance the color. It gets darker with repeated applications and time. This is a nice summer lotion alternative if you want an easy way to enhance your tan.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin but after reading the reviews for the Suave Professionals Gradual Self Tanner in the Light. I opted for the Medium Tan.  That was a good choice.  After one application, my legs had enough color to wear capris without shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a bit orangey and I did have a couple of streaks despite my best efforts, but as a kick start to summer clothes, this stuff is good!</li>
    <li> This definitely works! I daresay it might even be better if a tan than my usual Jergens one. But I also feel like this left my hands a little orange, where I never had that problem with my tanning lotion from Jergens,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; seems a little stronger with this one as well. Minor point as I actually like the smell, I&#x27;m weird, I know, but I&#x27;m sure there are many who do not like the smell of this stuff who would probably put off by the &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34; these things give off.</li>
    <li> cheapest price I could find and it gives a nice glow to fish belly white skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on a whim as I was thinking about getting darker for summer since I&#x27;m naturally pale and got it on sale.  It works well!  I was suprised.  I tried a self tanner once before and rembered it smelling funny for two days and also seeing lots of streaks which defeats the purpose.  This product works overnight!  Without streaks!  Safer &amp; faster than a tanning booth!  WOW!  There IS a trick to using it: you have to apply it evenly while completely nude (wearing gloves is best) then let it dry for at least 15 minutes before you get dressed.  It feels extremely weird for me to wander around nude for that long (lol) but since this works overnight I&#x27;ll do it.  I also apply lotion to my ankles and toes to prevent orangey build up in dry areas.  Even though this looks really natural on my body it shows up as dark orange on my ankles &amp; toes if I don&#x27;t pre-moisturise, then tissue off after application.  I used it about once a week to keep my dark tan up and it worked wonderfully.  Only once did I see streaks, and that was due to user error - I got dressed too quickly before bed and saw streaks on my legs from my pj&#x27;s.  So if you want this to work you have to apply it evenly and run around nude for as long as possible while it dries.  And there is one other weird thing... it feels like you just put on lotion for the rest of the evening.... like it&#x27;s still wet.  I still haven&#x27;t gotten used to this sensation but I love the way this makes my skin so nautrally tan and dark so fast so I put up with it.  Seems a small price to pay for an overnight tan vs going to the tanning salon 3x a week for at least 2 weeks to get the same amount of color.  Cheaper too!  The smell is sorta DHA reacting with skin, but not bad at all.  Definately not like the bananna boat self tanner I tried years ago, but a lot subtler.  Its there, but not overwhelming, and gone the next day after I shower.  I will continue to buy this in the future.  If you&#x27;re thinking about trying a self tanner, you must try this one first!  You won&#x27;t be disapointed. I promise, and I&#x27;m picky.ner, you must try this one first!  You won&#x27;t be disapointed. I promise, and I&#x27;m picky.</li>
    <li> I have a bit of a farmers tan from spending time outside with sports or other activities that have me with a shirt on.  Add to this the fact I got some bad sunburns when I was a teenager and now I&#x27;m really wary about spending too much time just sitting in the sun for tanning. I got this as a way of evening and expanding my tan zone and for that purpose I&#x27;m very pleased. Goes on easy with a very light scent and dries quickly, meaning you don&#x27;t have to put it on and then wait a long time to go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in SoCal, so a fake tan is crazy obvious and absurd, and I&#x27;m pleased with the tone this gives.  Use it lightly and sparingly and evening at first. Like a carpet spray, you might want to test a spot people might not see, just to see how it works. I didn&#x27;t do that, but I&#x27;m using it more to even out and give foundation color then start from scratch and only relying on the cream.</li>
    <li> This works okay, not great but not bad - somewhere down the middle (as most Suave products are). It is kind of like the knock-off version of the Jergen&#x27;s which I would definitely recommend over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color takes quite a bit of time to build, so plan a few days in advance and if you&#x27;re trying to move a couple shades - watch for streaking and make sure you really blend it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I may be hypersensitive to these types of lotions, because the smell does bother me a little - that classic self tanner scent, pure chemicals and vitamin-D-less tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra dollars and go with the better brand to see better results!</li>
    <li> this does not streak, and does give a natural glow.</li>
    <li> Great self tanner. Its smell is not overbearing, it dries quickly, and gives you natural-looking color after a few applications. I especially liked how it didn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky in bed after putting it on right before bed. A good-quality, cheap, safe way to get a little more color.</li>
    <li> The Suave Self-tanning lotion, suprisingly works very well compared to the Jergens self-tanning lotion. Especially for a Suave brand product, this is one of the best. I have been using the Jergens self-tanning lotion for over 2 yrs., &amp; switched to Suave self-tanning lotion due to the cheap price. The thickness of the lotion is not very thick, however is still creamy. I put on this lotion after a shower. I do notice an odor through out the day (didn&#x27;t notice an odor with the Jergens) which makes me use sparingly &amp; not an \\&quot;all over everyday\\&quot; body lotion as I was able to do with the Jergans self tanning. I don&#x27;t notice many streaks &amp; usually doesn&#x27;t cause orange palms like some self tanners &amp; bronzers. If you are the type who has tan skin or tans regularly, &amp; want a little subtle &amp; gradual boost of color for a CHEAP price, U will be very pleased with this product!!</li>
    <li> I love this product - used to use the St. Tropez gradual self tanner/moisturizer at $36 a bottle for 1/2 this quantity. This goes on great, smells fresh and offers me a gradual glow.</li>
    <li> Best self tanner on the market. Doesn&#x27;t turn orange or have a horrible smell like Jergens.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that gradual tan aspect would minimize the amount of streaking I experienced but it didn&#x27;t really. From what I&#x27;ve read from others this doesn&#x27;t happen if you apply it evenly carefully but I guess I just don&#x27;t have the talent to accomplish that goal. It&#x27;s hard to really see where I applied it after I&#x27;ve rubbed it in so not sure how to really deal with that problem. The gradual aspect would be nice but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes for awhile so I couldn&#x27;t readjust my application to make up for the streaking. Not my cup of tea -- I&#x27;ll stick to a tanning machine if I need a spray on-esc tan.</li>
    <li> ***update***&lt;br /&gt;I just want to say I am still loving this self tanner! It makes my skin bronze and glowing. I am olive skinned so I recommend this for olive and darker tones without the fear of turning orange. It looks very natural ... love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My natural skin color is tan/olive but my legs are very light at the start of summer. I hate wearing shorts and capris till my legs darken up to match the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had always wanted to try a self tanner but I felt they were not were not for me. However this one is designed for medium and tan skin tones !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tanner smells great and the scent almost dissipates entirely after it absorbs into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to smooth it on evenly and completely. I got none of the splotchy-ness that you often hear about with self tanners.  My \\&quot;tan\\&quot; came in quick... and lovely ! No orange just a nice sun kissed look! I noticed a difference within the first day of application. I love how nice it made my legs look !&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love the product and the price ( of under six bucks ) is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with this product.  I can&#x27;t get in the habit of using it every day.  I apply a bit a few times a week, but not all over.  I mostly use it to catch up areas that are in the sun less often, particularly my shoulders and around the sock line.  The color is light and It blends nicely.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive to try this because the last time I used a self tanner was when I was in middle school in the 1990&#x27;s and the results were laughably bad.  However, my sister swears by self tanners and has always had positive results so I decided to give this a try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  On my fair skin the color reads pretty natural (or at least reasonably close to what I&#x27;ve gotten when I&#x27;ve gone to a spray tanning salon).  The coverage might be a little more even when I&#x27;ve had a professional do it, but it was certainly much better than what I expected by doing it myself.  Part of it might be that I now aggressively exfoliate my skin, which seems to help create an even look.  Seems like self tanners truly have come a long way.</li>
    <li> I am really focused on staying out of the sun this summer so I knew I was going to need a good self tanner.  I like the gradual self tanners because as it happens over time, it is less shocking...and there is less chance of streaking.  I always exfoliate in the shower and put a light moisturizer on first...and then apply the self tanner all over, even my face.  It did not cause any breakouts and best of all....very little smell and all of it went away when dry.  I HATE smelling that self tanner smell all day and Sauve has delivered and for the right price too!</li>
    <li> This tanner is accurately described as being gradual and intended for daily use to build a tan, but I do find that it gives noticeable results for me much quicker than its counterpart for lighter skin. Based on my skin color, I felt either fair/medium or medium/tan could be a good choice. The lighter choice is more fool-proof but also more subtle on me. The smell isn&#x27;t bad and the color seemed realistic. However, I did deduct one star for some streaking around my ankles after a careful application of this version of the product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a self tanner since I was a teenager.  Without giving away my age, I&#x27;ll just say that the products back then used to turn me a not-so-nice shade of orange.  Since my natural complexion resembles the sickly white color of a fish belly, I was anxious to try this Suave Professionals Gradual Self Tanner that I was offered through the Amazon Vine review program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tanner is easy to apply, and smooths into my skin easily.  It didn&#x27;t transfer to my white bed sheets, which is a huge plus.  After about 3-4 days, my co-workers started mentioning what a nice tan I had.  I&#x27;m almost out of this bottle, and I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.  I think I&#x27;ll use the fair-medium shade in the future though, since the darkness of this shade was so drastically different from my normal lily white skin tone.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted to try out a self tanner prior to moving to Hawai&#x27;i, so we gave these a try.  The colour came gradually and didn&#x27;t streak.  Also, it was a nice lotion for post-shower or when waking up.  Worked great!</li>
    <li> Good stuff for the price. Builds tan well and consistently, not much streaking, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing (even WHITE clothing). However, it goes on skin smelling nice but as the tan develops later on it starts to stink like a true self tanner. The stink sticks to clothes but can be easily washed out. Otherwise, absolutely no complaints.</li>
</ol>
