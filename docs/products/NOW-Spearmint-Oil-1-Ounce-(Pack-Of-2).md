      <li>I searched out this product because when placed in a wick like environment, it just makes the whole house smell wonderful!</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>But I love the product.  </li>
      <li>, I should&#x27;ve read the instructions and diluted this stuff more.  </li>
      <li>Make sure to add it to another oil before using on skin, or it will burn.</li>
      <li>it keeps the mosquitos off of me. :)</li>
      <li>It will probably be another month of so before I need to order more.</li>
      <li>My reflexology clients love this oil.  </li>
      <li>While nothing is 100% effective with mice if they are really determined to set up housekeeping, this product is one of the cheapest and most effective deterrents to mice entering our motorhome or going under the hood and in the engine compartment.  </li>
      <li>Good product and pure oil as advertised.</li>
      <li>this stuff would be so strong.  </li>
      <li>Great for those facing emotional challenges.  </li>
      <li>It is a cheerful uplifting aroma.</li>
      <li>I use it in a tea light oil warmer and often mix it with balsam fir needle for the scent of the forest.</li>

      <li>Def helps calm to mind and injects sweetness into your day !</li>
      <li>I was so excited about finding the spearment oil since I find it lasts longer than the peppermint oil in my diffuser without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>, I have minty fresh, great breath, but I feel like someone rubbed muscle rub across my entire body.  </li>
      <li>Well so far so good and the garage smells minty fresh....</li>
      <li>Quick ship and will buy again.</li>
      <li>It evaporates moderately quickly so I will switch perhaps to almond oil.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not exaggerating, it&#x27;s that powerful.  </li>
      <li>Love all their products and will continue to buy them for as long as they are available.</li>
      <li>As soon as the package arrived, I opened it up, opened the cap and sniffed it, it smells exactly like fresh spearmint.  </li>
      <li>I hope that the results you see are as good as the ones we have had with this product over the past couple,years.</li>
      <li>(and that don&#x27;t seem to work very well).  </li>
      <li>When we went to trade in our 7 year old RV, the dealers remarked at how fresh and clean-smelling it was and asked what we used.  </li>
      <li>Wow!!!</li>
      <li>I am writing this review as a warning to buyers in general and pregnant ladies in particular.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/7/2013: Still using this spearmint oil.</li>
      <li>and I still have this overwhelmingly powerful sensation of coldness throughout my entire body.  </li>
      <li>live on six acres.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>I do NOT advise you to put this stuff directly in your mouth!</li>
      <li>This oil has the sweet minty scent of freshly crushed spearmint leaves.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t add it to the water in the tank but add drops directly into water where the ultrasonic mechanism is.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to be very careful not to use too much in any of my homemade products!  </li>
      <li>Living in a very wooded area and having an RV, it&#x27;s not unusual to have to deal with rodent problems.  </li>
      <li>Great for mental clarity and soothing the sinuses during a cold.</li>
      <li>My only real complains are that I can&#x27;t subscribe and save on it like I can other essential oils</li>

<li> So much better than artificial fragrances.  </li>
<li> A little mouse ate the tiny wires under my car and built a nest...</li>
<li> Due to the oily nature and bottle packaging, I didn&#x27;t realize that one of the caps was loose and that the contents had leaked on to the bottles.  </li>
<li> It lasts all day long with just a few drops.</li>
<li> I read the bottle, which warns you to dilute it, as this product is extremely concentrated.  </li>
<li> We place vials of cotton balls soaked in spearmint oil in the basement where the mice usually come in, and the little varmints keep away.</li>
<li> Not sure yet.  </li>
<li> When we told them &amp;#34;spearmint oil&amp;#34;, they said what an improvement it was over the usual moth balls that people tried using to repel mice</li>
<li> Try this product saturated on a cotton ball and placed in small Dixie cups throughout your house or motorhome.  </li>
<li> My first base has been vodka.  </li>
<li> I immediately googled \\&quot;Spearmint\\&quot; because I thought I read this was a bad oil to have in direct contact on skin during pregnancy (could cause miscarriage).  </li>
<li> The mechanic said this all to common even though I park in a garage.</li>
<li> The label is different and the smell!&lt;br /&gt;Pretty disappointed. ..</li>
<li> It is also used in toothpaste, too :-(.</li>
<li> So he said that if I pour spearmint on a towel and place it under my car that mice hate spearmint.</li>

    <li> I always loved your spearmint oil , but I can tell something was changed!! It just doesn&#x27;t smell the same as it did for years!! The label is different and the smell!&lt;br /&gt;Pretty disappointed. ..</li>
    <li> I needed the spearmint oil to put on cotton balls to deter mice from my flower garden.  Couldn&#x27;t find in any Pittsburgh stores so ordered online.  Quick ship and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Quality product.  I am using this for room fragance.  Mixing with eucalyputus.  My first base has been vodka.  It evaporates moderately quickly so I will switch perhaps to almond oil.  Not sure yet.  But I love the product.  Great price.  would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Now Foods makes wonderful reasonably priced essential oils and Spearmint is one of my favorites. This oil has the sweet minty scent of freshly crushed spearmint leaves. It is a cheerful uplifting aroma. I use it in a tea light oil warmer and often mix it with balsam fir needle for the scent of the forest.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! This stuff is incredibly potent!!!  As soon as the package arrived, I opened it up, opened the cap and sniffed it, it smells exactly like fresh spearmint.  I read the bottle, which warns you to dilute it, as this product is extremely concentrated.  Foolishly, I put about 1 drop on my tongue and swished it around my mouth.  Wow!  It&#x27;s about an hour later and I still have this overwhelmingly powerful sensation of coldness throughout my entire body.  As I sit here in my office, I literally feel like I have chills.  I feel great, I have minty fresh, great breath, but I feel like someone rubbed muscle rub across my entire body.  I&#x27;m not exaggerating, it&#x27;s that powerful.  I bought this for the purpose of making homemade mouthwash, fluoride-free toothpaste, soaps, and all kinds of things.  But I had no idea this stuff would be so strong.  I&#x27;ll have to be very careful not to use too much in any of my homemade products!  I deserve what I get, I should&#x27;ve read the instructions and diluted this stuff more.  I do NOT advise you to put this stuff directly in your mouth!</li>
    <li> I use this product in an oil warmer and the smell is strong and wonderfully spearmint. It lasts all day long with just a few drops. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/7/2013: Still using this spearmint oil. Excellent product, and it keeps the mosquitos off of me. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this almost seven months ago.  I am still using it.  It smells good and I can put it in my cleaner (I use vinegar) to make it smell good and also in my laundry.  So much better than artificial fragrances.  I even use it in the bathtub with a carrier oil. It will probably be another month of so before I need to order more.</li>
    <li> My reflexology clients love this oil.  Great for those facing emotional challenges.  Def helps calm to mind and injects sweetness into your day !</li>
    <li> It Even keeps varments out of the garbage cans.</li>
    <li> I searched out this product because when placed in a wick like environment, it just makes the whole house smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> I was so excited about finding the spearment oil since I find it lasts longer than the peppermint oil in my diffuser without being overpowering. I have essential oils going in my diffuser 24/7 to try and block out scents that can trigger my nausea caused by health issues. My only real complains are that I can&#x27;t subscribe and save on it like I can other essential oils and I wish they carried a larger size, i.e. 4 oz instead of just 1 oz bottles.</li>
    <li> Living in a very wooded area and having an RV, it&#x27;s not unusual to have to deal with rodent problems.  While nothing is 100% effective with mice if they are really determined to set up housekeeping, this product is one of the cheapest and most effective deterrents to mice entering our motorhome or going under the hood and in the engine compartment.  Another pro to its use is that it smells very good.  When we went to trade in our 7 year old RV, the dealers remarked at how fresh and clean-smelling it was and asked what we used.

I hope that the results you see are as good as the ones we have had with this product over the past couple,years.</li>
    <li> This is probably not what the manufacturer intended, but mice don&#x27;t like the smell.  We place vials of cotton balls soaked in spearmint oil in the basement where the mice usually come in, and the little varmints keep away.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance. Spearmint is used in mint jelly (yum!) and obviously spearmint gum. It is also used in toothpaste, too :-(. I use this in my regular household humidifier. I don&#x27;t add it to the water in the tank but add drops directly into water where the ultrasonic mechanism is.</li>
    <li> 2 Ounce size for the same price as local Co-Op. Thank You.</li>
    <li> Great oil from a great company.  Love all their products and will continue to buy them for as long as they are available.</li>
    <li> My review is not about the actual oil itself.  NOW Foods makes great products and the scent is very refreshing.  I am writing this review as a warning to buyers in general and pregnant ladies in particular.  I just received my 2 pack which was bubble wrapped.  Due to the oily nature and bottle packaging, I didn&#x27;t realize that one of the caps was loose and that the contents had leaked on to the bottles.  I immediately googled \\&quot;Spearmint\\&quot; because I thought I read this was a bad oil to have in direct contact on skin during pregnancy (could cause miscarriage).  I confirmed this was the case so immediately ran to dilute with olive oil.  I am not suggesting you not purchase the oil but please exercise caution when you are unwrapping the product and try to have a vegetable or carrier oil around, just in case.</li>
    <li> A drop of this in your trash can freshens things up. I put just a drop in my body oil and makes me feel cleaner. (I guess it is probably because it makes you feel like you have just brushed your teeth). Make sure to add it to another oil before using on skin, or it will burn.</li>
    <li> Helps with mice...Now Foods Spearmint Oil, 1-Ounce (pack Of 2)  A little mouse ate the tiny wires under my car and built a nest...&lt;br /&gt;I live on six acres. I drive a Mercedes could of cost a fortune. The mechanic said this all to common even though I park in a garage. So he said that if I pour spearmint on a towel and place it under my car that mice hate spearmint. Well so far so good and the garage smells minty fresh....</li>
    <li> Smells just like gum! Great for mental clarity and soothing the sinuses during a cold. Use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use just a couple of drops in my unscented shampoo and have that wonderful minty smell in my hair. I also use a couple of drops in my bath water for a soothing relaxing experience! Love the scent!</li>
    <li> Keeps the mice out of the RV during winter.  Works great !</li>
    <li> Good product and pure oil as advertised.</li>
