      <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you WHY, but this brush is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Nice brush, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is volumizing.  </li>

      <li>Great service, super product.</li>
      <li>This is, by far, the best brush I have ever used.</li>

      <li>it does add volume and it does not create static electricity in doing so...</li>
      <li>It seems to just roll off my hair more than get into the depts of it.</li>

      <li>It seems to give you somewhat more volume.</li>
      <li>Everybody has a favorite hairbrush.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle and has a good grip.</li>
      <li>Many people have reviewed this item to be &amp;#34;static free&amp;#34; and the product information said, &amp;#34;Static free brushes gently eliminate fly away hair that leads to static,&amp;#34; but I did not find that this was the case.</li>
      <li>This brush is fantastic for tangles and static, but i can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; about it.  </li>
      <li>It is lightweight, it glides through my hair, it helps with volume, and it really is static free.</li>
      <li>And as it &amp;#34;says&amp;#34;, static free.</li>
      <li>I love these brushes, If you are looking for a great Static Free Brush look no more, you have found it right here and for a great price</li>
      <li>My hair is so fine.  </li>
      <li>It was fine for working through the hair and adding volume.</li>
      <li>Love it, and product arrived so quickly.</li>
      <li>I love this thing very much!</li>
      <li>They are easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Great on my fine, blonde hair.</li>
      <li>Gives great volume for long hair.</li>
      <li>It goes through your hair with no pulling or static, works good with a hairdryer, and can even be used on wet hair.  </li>
      <li>It does a nice job of feathering hair and taking away the &amp;#34;just combed&amp;#34; look while making hair look natural.</li>
      <li>I love it so much for purse and home.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good investment, especially for folks who know how to style hair.</li>
      <li>This brush is smaller than it looks, it would be good for traveling.  </li>
      <li>THIS  LITTLE THING MAKES YOU ANT BRUSH YOUR AGAIN AND FEEL ALL GIRLY LOL, BECAUSE IT DOES SMOOTH OUT THE FRIZZ</li>
      <li>This is great to give your hair lift that other brushes don&#x27;t give.  </li>
      <li>falls apart quickly.  </li>
      <li>Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t actually pull my hair, and detangles it pretty nicely!</li>
      <li>This pictures the older, red-handled brush which is made of softer, better quality material.  </li>
      <li>NO REGRETS, MY HAIT GET TANGLED VERY EASILY, BUT</li>
      <li>I have been using the Cricket Static free brushes for 15 years, they are the only ones that I use.</li>
      <li>So far, I love it.</li>
      <li>This is my second Cricket Static Free Volumizer purchase.</li>
      <li>Not long after we got married, I ditched my brush and started exclusively using his Cricket Static Free Volumizer.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for fine hair.</li>
      <li>turned to Amazon to find them at the right price.</li>
      <li>I also like that it is easy to get through my wet hair, unlike most brushes.</li>
      <li>This brush works great and there is no static.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, light weight and helps your hair dry quickly.</li>
      <li>After years of getting mad at me for using his brush (I &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; more than he does), I have purchased my own now, and it&#x27;s still the same great brush.  </li>
      <li>Liked it so much a bought a few extras.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>(my hair is medium thickness, and straight)</li>
      <li>and this really didn&#x27;t do too much for me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really lightweight.  </li>
      <li>Exactly the brush I had been searching the shops for to replace my 20 year old one exactly like it  </li>
      <li>I have really fine hair, that is often very flat.</li>
      <li>Easy to use on long hair, does not get tangled.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, limp hair, and it prevents static buildup and is the only line I use!!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get caught in my fine dry hair and helps detangle.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and this brush makes all the difference, giving the illusion that my hair is not nearly as fine as it is.</li>
      <li>Occasionally I&#x27;ll have to use a spritz or two of Kahm hair oil, but most of the time, the brush is enough.</li>
      <li>It is a good quality product that has held up well over the last few years.  </li>
      <li>My husband has had this brush since he was in high school (think, over 20 years).  </li>
      <li>It refuses to be back combed, and mostly just lays flat...</li>
      <li>I was a little skeptical of the claims about this brush (static free), but I decided to give it a try based on the good reviews and low price.</li>
      <li>The brush really lifts your hair and gives it volume, as the bristles are set far apart and point in all kinds of directions.</li>
      <li>i have used this brush for years now,the only brush i use,they last a long time,i love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap enough that 8 months of nearly daily use is probably an acceptable lifespan.  </li>
      <li>It does seem to add a small amount of volume without static.  </li>
      <li>not sure how it works, but i love this brush...</li>
      <li>I have a short, layered bob that was lacking volume, has little growing hairs sticking out on top, and likes to cause a time consuming battle every morning, when styling.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have purchased several of these brushes over the years and needed a few more. Have been looking all over the city for another. What a delight to find it at Cricket when I did a search on Amazon. I got three, and I gave my husband two of them for Christmas. He was as delighted as I was. The brush really lifts your hair and gives it volume, as the bristles are set far apart and point in all kinds of directions. It&#x27;s the only brush I have used for over 10 years! I have very fine hair and this brush makes all the difference, giving the illusion that my hair is not nearly as fine as it is. This brush lasts forever. Highly recommended for fine hair. Cricket promised it would arrive before Christmas (I ordered only 10 days before!) and it arrived in time. Thank you Cricket! Great service, super product.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the greatest.  They are easy to clean and easy to use. They do not tangle your hair.I had an old one and needed to replace it. turned to Amazon to find them at the right price.</li>
    <li> These brushes were used by a lady that cut my hair a long time ago. They were so old and I was so happy to find them on amazon!</li>
    <li> Best Brush Ever.  I have fine thin hair. This brush works great and there is no static. Previously I used a round barrell type brush but this is much better. I bought two I love it so much for purse and home.</li>
    <li> I tried it on me and my doll&#x27;s wig. It worked as supposed to be.The quality of the product is good. Satiesfied.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Cricket Static free brushes for 15 years, they are the only ones that I use. I love these brushes, If you are looking for a great Static Free Brush look no more, you have found it right here and for a great price too!!A must have for everyone in my home, once you have used this brush, you wont want to use any other!!! Try it, what have you got to loose?</li>
    <li> Have used this item for years! Love it. NO STATIC!!!</li>
    <li> This brush does what it says it will do. The only negative is that it is hard to get stray hairs out.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, light weight and helps your hair dry quickly. I have short hair and it works very well. This is my second Cricket Static Free Volumizer purchase.</li>
    <li> NO REGRETS, MY HAIT GET TANGLED VERY EASILY, BUT THIS  LITTLE THING MAKES YOU ANT BRUSH YOUR AGAIN AND FEEL ALL GIRLY LOL, BECAUSE IT DOES SMOOTH OUT THE FRIZZ</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic for tangles and static, but i can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; about it.  This is my second one, because the bristle ends eventually wore off my last one, probably from me not removing hair often enough.</li>
    <li> This is ABSOLUTELY the best hairbrush you will ever own!  I am not exaggerating!  It goes through your hair with no pulling or static, works good with a hairdryer, and can even be used on wet hair.  It is a good quality product that has held up well over the last few years.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have a great deal of extremely fine hair. It tends to break off and be difficult to control. This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever found for my hair type</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best brush I have ever used. My stylist uses one and recommended it to me. I have a short, layered bob that was lacking volume, has little growing hairs sticking out on top, and likes to cause a time consuming battle every morning, when styling. Well... not anymore. This amazing Cricket volumizer changed all of that. It honestly works so well, that I just placed an order for another one. Great brush, great price, and fast shipping. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this!!</li>
    <li> Love this line of brushes!! I have fine, limp hair, and it prevents static buildup and is the only line I use!!</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  I did not know it was manufactured in Taiwan or I would have picked up several when I was there recently.  Everybody has a favorite hairbrush.  This is mine!</li>
    <li> If you have short hair and want lift and volume this is the brush for you.  It has a narrow flat head that allows you to grip and lift close to the hair line. I purchased 5 different brushes before buying this one and could not achieve the salon finish I was aiming for, but thanks to this little brush my hair always looks like I just stepped out of the Salon.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these brushes from my hair stylist until she retired, I ordered a bunch of them, just so I can have spare ones.  This is the only brush that I use and I hope they continue to make them.</li>
    <li> I love this brush as its smaller size is perfect for traveling, gym bag, car etc...I bought several and keep them in multiple locations/bags</li>
    <li> This brush is smaller than it looks, it would be good for traveling.  It does seem to add a small amount of volume without static.  I would probably just buy a vent brush at my local store next time.</li>
    <li> A great product! I have wavy hair on the way to become healthy after a bad treatment (coloring etc). I love this thing very much!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get caught in my fine dry hair and helps detangle. Very gentle and has a good grip. Good buy</li>
    <li> i have used this brush for years now,the only brush i use,they last a long time,i love it!</li>
    <li> My hair is so fine.  This comb helped to have bigger hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for years.&lt;br /&gt;Great to brush hair after shampooing, blow drying,  and when i use the flat iron</li>
    <li> Nice brush, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is volumizing.  I have longer layers and this really didn&#x27;t do too much for me.  It&#x27;s just a nice brush.  I think it would be more effective in the volumizing department if you had shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Ordered the picture and received something different.  This pictures the older, red-handled brush which is made of softer, better quality material.  The one I received is all black and is hard and disappointing.</li>
    <li> Bought based on reviews! Shame on me..... I find no increased or even volume using this brush.  Highly disappointing especially since AMAZON required this Brush and Vent Brush desired to only be purchased as &#x27;add on&#x27; to over set $$$ purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for probably 10 yrs.  It was time to be replaced, and I was amazed that I could even still find it!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of the claims about this brush (static free), but I decided to give it a try based on the good reviews and low price. So far, I love it. It is the best brush I have for blow drying my hair, and I have a drawer full of them. It is lightweight, it glides through my hair, it helps with volume, and it really is static free. Wish I had found it sooner before I spent all the money on my collection of brushes from various places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor quibble is that the handle is slightly wider than I would like, but I have very small hands, so that is probably not a concern for most people. Try this bursh, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Any of the Cricket brand brushes are excellent, and are the best brushes I&#x27;ve EVER used.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is great to give your hair lift that other brushes don&#x27;t give.  Spray hair spray on &amp; lift with the brush while you dry.</li>
    <li> I dunno, maybe I&#x27;m just not experienced enough with brushes to realize that the red things are supposed to fall off after 8 months.  If they are, then bump this baby up to 5 stars.  As a brush, it&#x27;s a good brush.  Really volumizes my hair after a few run throughs.  It&#x27;s cheap enough that 8 months of nearly daily use is probably an acceptable lifespan.  Now that those little red things are falling off it&#x27;s scratching my head a bit, so I&#x27;ll probably buy another one here shortly.  Unless someone lets me know they&#x27;re supposed to last longer.</li>
    <li> This brush is great. Gives great volume for long hair. I bought a brush for every body in our family!</li>
    <li> My husband has had this brush since he was in high school (think, over 20 years).  Not long after we got married, I ditched my brush and started exclusively using his Cricket Static Free Volumizer.  I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you WHY, but this brush is amazing.  After years of getting mad at me for using his brush (I &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; more than he does), I have purchased my own now, and it&#x27;s still the same great brush.  My only complaint is I wish they made another color - the only way we can tell the difference is the amount of wear on the brush!</li>
    <li> does what it promises to do. Excellent for the dry winter weather with all the fly aways! Very satisfied with product</li>
    <li> Had one for over 10 years, and just lost it.  Now I am replacing it.  Works great for me!</li>
    <li> Many people have reviewed this item to be &amp;#34;static free&amp;#34; and the product information said, &amp;#34;Static free brushes gently eliminate fly away hair that leads to static,&amp;#34; but I did not find that this was the case. In fact it leaves my hair with quite a bit of static. It was fine for working through the hair and adding volume.</li>
    <li> I have fine straight(ish) hair that&#x27;s prone to fly aways. this brush does a good job drying it and brushing it, does seem to help w/ the fly aways!</li>
    <li> I have really fine hair, that is often very flat. It refuses to be back combed, and mostly just lays flat... unless it&#x27;s humid, in which case it lies flat and does that annoying wispy curl thing. Usually I try flipping my hair over, drying from below, or using a vent brush of some sort, or a round brush, but they all caused static, which would turn into the annoying wispy curl thing. So, when my friend (who is also my hairdresser) recommended this, I figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it. I can get volume with no static, and without having to flip my hair over in the morning. The vent design helps my hair to dry faster, and actually keeps it pretty sleek at the same time. Occasionally I&#x27;ll have to use a spritz or two of Kahm hair oil, but most of the time, the brush is enough. It&#x27;s a good investment, especially for folks who know how to style hair. Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t actually pull my hair, and detangles it pretty nicely!</li>
    <li> Exactly the brush I had been searching the shops for to replace my 20 year old one exactly like it  So glad to see they were still in production I ordered 3 of them and have them in bath and bedrooms  Love it, and product arrived so quickly.</li>
    <li> This brush is advertised as good for drying the hair, and it is that. I also like that it is easy to get through my wet hair, unlike most brushes. (my hair is medium thickness, and straight)</li>
    <li> This works if used with a hairdryer. It seems to give you somewhat more volume. It is a good comb for tangled hair too.</li>
    <li> These are a great hair brush.  My wife and I both have been using them for years.  It does a nice job of feathering hair and taking away the &amp;#34;just combed&amp;#34; look while making hair look natural.</li>
    <li> I read a terrible review about this brush because someone got it tangled in her hair.  Apparently a moderate IQ is required before purchase.  This is not a round brush.  Don&#x27;t roll your hair in it..</li>
    <li> falls apart quickly.  balls on the bristles fail.</li>
    <li> Cannot tell that it causes volume and find it rather difficult to brush with.  It seems to just roll off my hair more than get into the depts of it.</li>
    <li> not sure how it works, but i love this brush...it works so much better than those at the grocery or drug stores...it does add volume and it does not create static electricity in doing so...it is in my travel bag and my bathroom drawer...</li>
    <li> This hair tool is terrific; gently glides through hair (even when wet). Great on my fine, blonde hair. And as it &amp;#34;says&amp;#34;, static free.</li>
    <li> This hairbrush is the best.  Easy to use on long hair, does not get tangled.  I use it on both dry and wet hair and for blowdrying and it works well for all.  It&#x27;s really lightweight.  Liked it so much a bought a few extras.</li>
