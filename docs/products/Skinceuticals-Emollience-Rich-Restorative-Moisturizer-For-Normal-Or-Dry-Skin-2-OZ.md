    <li> This product feels good going on- but did nothing for me. Switched to Murad and love it</li>
    <li> I have been using Skinceuticals A.G.E. Interrupter and other products in the line for several years, and love them.  I have often switched skincare lines in the past but have stuck with Skinceuticals for about 7 years.  I like the A.G.E but it is very expensive and I thought I would try their less expensive moisturizers.  Although my skin is combination, it is very dry where I live, so I looked for moisturizers for dry skin. This product makes my skin feel great but it is not quite as emollient as I expected,  I have to apply it a couple of times a day when it is really dry. That is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  However, humidity is often in single digits here, so it takes industrial strength moisturizers to make a dent in skin dryness.  Using lotions and moisturizers multiple times a day is routine.  This seems like a very good product so I will see how it goes and update if necessary.</li>
    <li> The cream is rick and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Moisturizing, but not greasy.  Perfect for my 45 year old skin</li>
    <li> Hey, this is great stuff!  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using only Skincrutical products for years and they are the best.  I use this one are night &amp; then the A.G.E. Moisturizer in the morning.  I also use the A.G.E eye cream &amp; the 50 SPF sunscreen.</li>
    <li> as always SkinCeutical delivers the best products</li>
    <li> mrs siegel swears by their products</li>
    <li> Not thick and works well.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your prompt service.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was recommended to me by a woman who does facials at a resort. I don&#x27;t know if she is supposed to promote this line of skin care but she&#x27;s used it on me twice. I bought it based on her recommendation as well as how I liked the way it felt after the facial. It&#x27;s light but but an effective moisturizer. By that I mean that my face doesn&#x27;t dry out or feel stiff, tight or heavy after using it and my skin feels moisturized for several hours after applied. My facial skin is a mixture of oily and dry and this product works well with it. I&#x27;ve tried lots of different moisturizers over the years and I&#x27;ve liked this one for a longer period of time than any other I&#x27;ve used in the past&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to recommend or not recommend this type of product because one&#x27;s experience with moisturizers is something personal and dependent on skin type and what the user likes or doesn&#x27;t like in a moisturizer. But I can say that I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for over a year and still love it.</li>
    <li> The dermatology office recommended this moisturizer and I am pleasantly surprised with the product.  I will try other Skinceuticals offerings soon.</li>
    <li> I Love all skin ceutical products.  Worth the price and would recommend to anyone looking for quality skin care product.</li>
    <li> Outstanding...Out of all the moisturizers I have used this one is the best...I have combo skin and this gives me hydration where I need it but not oily where I don&#x27;t. Its the best one I have used under makeup does not make it slide off or disappear like others, makeup stays put...Tip after applying give it a couple of Min&#x27;s to sink in then apply makeup. Perfect every time. Also works great  over topical retinoids (for example, tretinoin).</li>
    <li> This is a very good Moisturizer for normal to dry type skin.  I have used this product for years, and my dermatologist was the one whom suggested this for me. Usually, I purchase it from her office, but once I saw it on Amazon, it&#x27;s easier to have sent to my door.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and never dry. I buy it again and again and again.</li>
    <li> This is a product with better results than these over priced, very expensive name brands with very reasonable price. It works very well for the skin and has great results as a restorative moisturizer. Please try it and you will believe this one is at least having the same effects on your skin if not better than these name brands, but with a fraction of costs.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years, especially after using Tretinoin. It was recommended to me by my dermotologist. I am not super dry, but it gives that extra moisture without being greasy. From, Cindy</li>
    <li> have only been using these products for about 2 weeks and so jury is still out, but so far my face is better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a red head with freckles and I have very sensitive skin. This product does not burn or irritate my face. This is the third time ordering it. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Fake.  It seemed different when I opened it.  So I went to an older container that still had some in it.  Yep it was different.  Wanted to be sure, so I went to the salon and bought a new one.  Sure enough.  This product is not the same as the product I purchased from the Salon.  Different Color, Smell and Texture.</li>
