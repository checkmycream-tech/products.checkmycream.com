      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I love how easy it is to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and one pad does my face, neck, and top of my hands.  </li>

      <li>but then i got tazorac free.  </li>
      <li>I bought the Miracle Worker kit in a bid to smooth out the clogged pores on my chin and deliver a glow for my complexion.</li>
      <li>Make-up goes on so smoothly.</li>

      <li>** pads&amp;#34; because that&#x27;s what they make your face feel like...as smooth as a baby&#x27;s tooshy.</li>
      <li>I notice that the clogged pores were significantly reduced.</li>
      <li>That could be why I don&#x27;t feel like I see significant results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Could have used more of the solution, but I like the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I can&#x27;t really tell a huge difference in my skin. I&#x27;m 52 and have fine wrinkles around my eyes.  It seems to clear up some adult acne and even my skin tone. I&#x27;ve done a lot of reading about retinol products, learning that it takes time to see a big difference. So, I will keep going with this product, which I use it in conjunction with Philosophy&#x27;s Miracle Worker moisturizer. (I love the moisturizer!) All of this said, it&#x27;s a pleasure to use both products and is certainly not hurting in any way. I&#x27;ve never experienced any burning or redness. The little pads stay saturated with the solution down to the bottom of the jar. Give this product a try.</li>
    <li> I just started using  and I really do like them - I will update my review once I use them more</li>
    <li> Great skin care product!  Dark spots are lightening.  Well pleased and will continue to use as part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Does a great job of brightening and evening skin tone, without the flaky side effects of a stronger retinol product.</li>
    <li> I liked philosophy skin care but now find it&#x27;s overrated and become too expensive.  I don&#x27;t feel the pads have enough retinoid solution.  When I apply the pads to my face, it&#x27;s not saturated enough with solution so it feels a little rough on my face.  For what they charge, they should give the customer more solution or cut the price in half.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a retinoid that was gentler than the prescription Retin A and rolled the dice with this one after reading some reviews.  I&#x27;ve been on this now for a 1.5 months (except for a week of traveling) and I must say that I like this product a lot.  After a week or so of using this, I have noticed improvement in my skin. I&#x27;ve used less foundation, and the overall appearance of my skin just looks very healthy.  I&#x27;ve shed a little, maybe once the entire time,  which I expected, but still to my surprise that the shedding is not heavy and not scaly compared to when I was using Retin A.  A little goes a long way.  One pad can cover your face, and like what others said there&#x27;s enough for your décolleté and hands.  The only complain I have is the yucky oily greasy feel it has upon touching my skin.  There is a lil tingle too (not painful, more like tiny fizzes) when you apply it.  This almost turned me off completely when I first put it on BUT, it dries on your face clear and clean!!  No oily residue!  During the first few days/weeks it was the last thing I put on my face in the evenings, but recently I have been following it with a moisturizer for my face feels dry and tight after applying it.  But to me this is normal too because once again, it was something I&#x27;ve experience before when using retinoids.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> After deciding that I should start being proactive about mg skin care, I did a lot of research. This product kept coming up as a &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; product. This was my first philosophy product and one of my favorites. My skin is transformed. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My favorite philosophy product. I love how soft my skin feels when I use it. It&#x27;s so costly, I don&#x27;t use it everyday so it will last longer.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ever ordered from this company. Within 4 days I had my order. I was shocked! The comfirmation gave me approx.2 weeks. I will definately order from them again. Package was very secure.Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought the Miracle Worker kit in a bid to smooth out the clogged pores on my chin and deliver a glow for my complexion. I notice that the clogged pores were significantly reduced. I used this with \\&quot;When Hope is Not Enough\\&quot; moisturizer and my complexion was dewy and well-nourished when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stay in the tropical country of Singapore, am in my mid-thirties with skin that starts to dull. So this is really a miracle saver. Thanks, Philosophy, you did it again!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> These retinoid pads are great for your skin. They nourish the skin and keep it hydrated and young looking. I love how easy it is to use. The pads stay moistened and it does a wonderful job of keeping the skin youthful looking... I would recommend it to everyone..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! Skin feels smooth and definitely shows fewer lines. It has now become a staple in my skin care routine. Very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old so - of course! - I&#x27;m expecting and wishing for youth in a bottle.  That being said, it is a wonderful product that truly has clarified my skin both in terms of texture and appearance.  I would certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! See results within 5-7 days. Improved clarity, texture, and softness. Wrinkles diminished and less noticeable. This product really lives up to its name MIRACLE WORKER!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Items as listed. Prompt shipping. Love Philosophy!</li>
    <li> This is the best product on the market!! Noticed changes within day 4 of using- I love this and have told my family and friends about and they have ordered it now too and are seeing results (that&#x27;s 8 referrals that ordered and are happy) I would love to continue this product however since it&#x27;s a bit pricey and I have numerous hospital bills ROLLING IN IT SADDENS ME I WILL NOT be able to order again for a few months :&#x27;-(</li>
    <li> Effective and very good for sensitive ski, but a little expensive.</li>
    <li> MY favorite philosophy product!  I buy it over and over again</li>
    <li> I use it as a makeup remover then apply it to the back of my hands and neck every morning after my shower.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and like it. I was at the dermatologist today and she said my skin was beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I am 58 yrs. old and use it at night after my shower and then apply moisturizer. Philosophy had a similar product for use in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;that was good as well.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this product I have notices lines under the eyes are becomeing smaller.  It is easy to&lt;br /&gt;wipe on and I usually swipe it over my whole face and neck.  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> I am naturally a bit skeptical, but this really does work! My pores are smaller and my face feels cleaner. However, the pads are VERY dry, almost like it needs a bit more than 2 fl, oz to properly wet 60 pads (I followed the directions to the letter when I added the solution, so it is not user error, it just needs to be maybe a 3 fl. oz. bottle instead). I read other reviews and people said that they noticed as soon as one day later. I thought that was a bit impossible, but I have to say I noticed a VERY small difference by the second day....needless to say I was very impressed. I have had no irritation on my skin, and my skin feels softer, cleaner, and smaller pores. I have only been using it one week, so I have not noticed any anti- aging effects, but the directions say it will take 8 weeks before any noticeable effects in aging will be noticed.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> This is a really good treatment for the skin.  It makes my skin seem oily at first, but my skin absorbs the solution and then it makes my skin so soft.  I can really feel the difference when I use this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of Miracle Worker pads, and either I&#x27;m just older and not getting the same response, or they are not quite the potency they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I got GLOWING, porcelain skin from this product with reduced pore appearance and smooth texture. Multiple people joked about me being a wax statue, like at Madam Tussaud&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, a few years later, at age 35, I am not getting the same results. Could it be more diluted now, to increase profits? Hmm...</li>
    <li> Although I read a slew of great reviews for this product and got a recommendation from a friend, this was not for me. My chin broke out like crazy and my cheeks started peeling after using this. Maybe I don&#x27;t have the right skin type for this, but it was a waste of money for me. I&#x27;m disappointed - I had high hopes for this.</li>
    <li> It is great really makes a difference, one you yourself can actually see!! It is well worth trying you will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> My last purchase of this item did meet my expectations as before and i will be purchasing again in the near future.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. No more breakouts or dry patches, skin looks healthier. I use it at night combined with Miracle Worker moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and one pad does my face, neck, and top of my hands.  It is not irritating to my skin nor does it cause redness.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it for 5 days and I cannot see any improvement of my fine lines but I did not expects an instantaneous response.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this product, and it does make my skin glow.  I&#x27;m not sure that it does anything for the fine lines/wrinkles, but my skin overall looks better.  I do think there are less expensive products that work as well though...Peter Thomas Roth Unwrinkle Peel Pads for one, and Avon&#x27;s peel pads work well too.  This is not a product I go out of my way to buy due to other less expensive options available, but I like to mix up my products, so do buy it occasionally.</li>
    <li> I just started to use this product and I can already see a huge difference in my skin tone, pore size, and overall completion.  My skin is improving and I could not be more pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll update this review after I finish all of the pads, but so far I am not impressed.  As a thirty-something woman, I am just beginning to notice fine lines on my face and I have some acne scars I would like to diminish. I bought this because I read several glowing reviews of this product all over the internet. I have been using this product for over a month now and have noticed few benefits. The acne scars are still the same dark color. Also, I feel like this product makes me break out more than usual, so I have to contend with not giving myself new acne scars. I am giving it three stars because my face does feel dewy and plump in the morning after using this product before bed. That might be what some women love about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are in your twenties, don&#x27;t waste your money on this!  You do not need it. Your skin is beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great for my skin!</li>
    <li> I love it! I have been using these pads religiously for the past few months and I get many comments on how clear and glowing my complexion is.</li>
    <li> I tried these pads not expecting much. I have dry patches and crows feet, in the first week I used them I saw a difference. I have been using them for a month now, and all my dry patches are gone and my crows feet are less noticeable. My daughter saw such a big difference in my face, she is now using it!</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks use, this lightened some brown spots I have on my face and hands. But then I had a reaction I guess. I stopped using it til the places went away and tried again. Then I had another place come up.  It&#x27;s still there after a week. It&#x27;s faded to pink but still raised. I&#x27;ve already returned this. I gave 2 stars because it did lighten my skin.</li>
    <li> Works just like  having prescription tazorac or retinol. Possibly better.  Would have baought more but then i got tazorac free.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It really has minimized my pores and that is what I bought it for because that has been my life&#x27;s mission to find something that would make them smaller and it has certainly done that. I have been using it for 3 weeks.  I cut the pads in half and there is plenty of solution to do my face, neck and chest.  I was hoping it would do more for my fine lines and wrinkles, but I may have been hoping for a miracle.  I will purchase the product again.</li>
    <li> I call these pads &amp;#34;baby&#x27;s a** pads&amp;#34; because that&#x27;s what they make your face feel like...as smooth as a baby&#x27;s tooshy. And not even after a few weeks but after using ONE pad. These things are indeed miraculous, and I can tell when I skip a few days because the bumps on my chin and around my nose start to creep up. The entire philosophy line is a total win--it&#x27;s expensive, but absolutely worth every single cent. I should also mention that some stuff here on amazon is cheaper than on philosophy.com BUT not everything. Do yourself a favor and double check with philosophy.com and other beauty sites before making your purchase here. You&#x27;d be surprised how much stuff is incredibly overpriced here...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I haven&#x27;t seen my age spots disappear yet and I can&#x27;t tell if they&#x27;re getting lighter. I cannot say if I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this retinol product for over a year now.  It helps erase fine lines, moisturizes your skin, and gives a healthy, fresh glow.</li>
    <li> These make the skin feel amazing. My skin looks revitalized when I use the pads every day.  I&#x27;ve used the pads for several years and I remain pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I initially got a trial size of these pads with a kit, and within days I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping in mind that everyone&#x27;s skin is different and what works for me might not work for you, I have to say that the Philosophy Miracle Worker products TRULY have worked for me. I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin after just one day. Within two weeks, my skin tone and texture had improved, and the skin on my neck is much tighter. After four weeks, the appearance of my wrinkles has reduced significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I use the retinoid pads along with the Miracle Worker moisturizer and the Miracle Worker Anti-Age Concentrate, I don&#x27;t know how the pads would perform by themselves on my face - I started using all of the products at once. That said, used together, the results have been amazing. But I CAN say that I use the pads on the backs of my hands (the instructions say to wipe on face, neck, and the backs of your hands,) and honestly, after four weeks of use, my hands look at least ten years younger. The skin is much less papery and wrinkly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background: I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, I have fair, dry skin, and in the last few years I&#x27;ve noticed my age catching up with me. I&#x27;d used Oil of Olay Regenerist for a couple of years, as well as ROC, Boots, and Clinique products, but my changing skin meant I needed to try something new and more powerful. Philosphy Miracle Worker is a little spendy so I hesitated trying it, but it was absolutely worth it. I do recommend getting the trial size kit though, just in case it doesn&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions, and do be careful not to get the retinoid pads too close to the eyes. When I accidentally get too close, I wake up with some puffiness. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, but I did have a minor acne breakout on my chin when I first started using this skin care system, so if you try it, you probably don&#x27;t want to do it before something important, like a wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful tip: Cut the pads in half before you pour the bottle of solution over them. They&#x27;ll last twice as long, and half of a pad is plenty for your entire face, neck, and the backs of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super product!s in half before you pour the bottle of solution over them. They&#x27;ll last twice as long, and half of a pad is plenty for your entire face, neck, and the backs of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super product!</li>
    <li> I return to these pads every so many months, alternating them with exfoliation (either the Philosophy Microdelivery Peel or Exfoliating Wash). There is perhaps no simpler method to use on a nighty basis for maintaining clear, smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a few years now as part of my beauty regime. Very good and works well whilst I sleep. Will continue to use it as long as philosophy makes it.</li>
    <li> I started using this products just before Christmas. I was told I look at least 10 years younger.&lt;br /&gt; My sister had used it for about 6 months, she looks amazing.</li>
    <li> Did not help  with my hyperpigmentation which was what I bought this for. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> The retinoid pads are great for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a difference almost immediately. My skin looks clearer and brighter.</li>
    <li> I like tiny pores and undectable age spots. When I&#x27;ve done my face I put the rest of it on my hands and I swear I don&#x27;t see spots on my hands anymore either. Just use it everyday once you have poured the serum over the pads.  If you let it sit more than 70or 80 days it changes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for 4 weeks with no change in my skin at all. If anything, I have more acne than before. I MIGHT have smaller pores...but very little results, if any, along with 3 huge zits on my face. Debating if I should continue this product or not...</li>
    <li> I really liked these at first until I started noticing dry patches on my face.  I have dry skin so I had to stop using them.  Once I did, the dry patches disappeared.  I may have to use them in less sensitive areas on my face (not around the eyes!) I really liked how they got more makeup off my face even after I had washed it.</li>
    <li> I needed to add something else to my regiment other than basics and this has pretty good review, very simple and it seems to be packed with power.  So far so good!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months. I&#x27;m still undecided. I follow up with Micacle Worker moisturizer . It&#x27;s a nice combo at night.</li>
    <li> Great product for men and women. Makes skin feel so soft .  Face looks better than ever. Pores are much smaller. Make-up goes on so smoothly. This product is one of the best over the counter retinol I have ever tried,</li>
    <li> If I could have one of everything in the Philosophy line I would.  I love their products so much, I just can&#x27;t get enough.  Everyone should try this if they want their skin to stop breaking out, smoothing out lines and erasing red or darker marks on your skin.</li>
    <li> Have been using this little &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; (both am and pm) and after a month I am seeing visable differences in my skin tone.  Imperfections and spots are fading.  Skin is lighter and brighter and did not irritate my sensitive skin.  Oh yea, very happy with the miracle in a jar.  Will buy again and again...</li>
    <li> Fantastic product even on &#x27;mature&#x27; skin. Results noticed within 5 days. I only use the pads 3 times per week and the laugh lines along the side of my mouth are much smaller, the lines on the outside of my eyes less visible and the horizontal lines on my neck area are also much thinner. No skin irritation and I follow up with a night moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The right name for the product - Miracle Worker!</li>
    <li> Works just as described, highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any great improvement yet but I&#x27;m not very good at using face products on a regular routine.</li>
    <li> not strong enough to show difference</li>
    <li> i love it. i&#x27;m not going anywhere with out this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much dirt these pads get off of my face even after I have washed it.</li>
    <li> I am 62 and decided I needed to try and make my hands look younger... I used these retinoid pads.. after using on my face at night I had enouogh &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; left in them to rub on my hands.. and wow !  Both hands and face look fabulous!  Now I have my husband using them, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had such good luck purchasing Philosophy on Amazon; where I always pay less than on the Philosophy website.  And I&#x27;ve read that sometimes the products are old and not as effective; but that has not been my experience.  With the retinol pads in particular, you have to pour the solution over the pads, prior to using them on your face.  So what you&#x27;re using is fresh.  Great Buy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and I can see the benefits.  Creates smoother skin and hopefully reduces wrinkles.  Amazon&#x27;s price is generally lower than other retailers.  I will continue to buy here.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> At least not for me.  I use the Purity cleanser, microbead cleanser, all sorts of Philosophy products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one dried my skin out, caused it to look worse, actually.  I paid a lot of money and now I&#x27;m stuck with something that didn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;d be honest if it did, but it just didn&#x27;t for me.  I&#x27;ve gone back to some of the rich philosophy creams to help my wrinkles.  I am 50.  I think maybe it would work well for the late 20&#x27;s and early 30&#x27;s.  It does dry your skin out.  It should come with a warning for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ACTUALLY noticed MORE fine lines, as a result.</li>
    <li> I wanted to start using a retinoid product - and selected this one because of the price &amp; recognizable name. So far it&#x27;s OK. I was surprised that the product feels oily on the pad, however not oily once on the skin. I do not use it every day - normally every other evening. That could be why I don&#x27;t feel like I see significant results.</li>
    <li> I love these pads seems to keep my skin clear.</li>
    <li> Has made a difference with lines on my chin that I hated! Also helps fade dark patches from my melasma.</li>
    <li> Definitely decreases the fine lines and helps to brighten the skin.  Use a couple times a week so as to not do damage to the skin.</li>
    <li> Dry Dry Skin! This caused me horrible dry patches all over my face!&lt;br /&gt;I have normal skin and this really irritated my skin.  Please, if you find this product dries your skin, do not continue... Please stop using. I continued and thought it would &amp;#34;take time to adjust to my skin&amp;#34; umm, no way.  Don&#x27;t listen to the reviews that say otherwise, you are hurting your skin.  It has been over a  week of not using this product and my skin remains horrible and dry with red splotches all over! I spent almost $90 on the entire miracle worker line... Uhh  Waste!</li>
    <li> This product is the MAIN REASON I switched over from the skin care line I&#x27;d faithfully been using.  Again, I watched this being demonstrated on QVC.  The model, and not a young woman, had beutiful glowing pink skin after applying the solution with the pad.  I figured if I didn&#x27;t like it I could always send it back.  After only ONE PAD I was hooked and knew I had to keep it.  In literally one week of dilligent use every night followed by the Miracle Worker moisturizer my skin is firmer, more even tone, less ruddy splotches and GLOWING!!!  I&#x27;m over 55 and my skin just didn&#x27;t have it anymore.  NOT ANY LONGER!  My husband told me I looked so pretty while I was getting ready for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since kept reordering this product...it&#x27;s so well worth it...I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORDER IT NOW!!!</li>
    <li> I loved the cleanser so I tried this too and after four weeks of daily use my face became more irritated and broken out. I stopped use two days ago and all back to normal.</li>
    <li> Philosophy miracle worker retinoids pads are easy to use and my skin feels so soft after using them. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I poured the serum on the pads as they instructed and even after they were supposely suppose to be &amp;#34;soaked&amp;#34; with the serum they came out dry each time I would open the container to use them. Each pad felt grainy on my face. It felt like it had been watered down. This is my first purchase of philosophy products on Amazon and I must say I will probably never order this brand from this site again. I will stick with the Philosophy website even though it is more expensive, atleast I am dealing directly with the company. I do love Amazon just not happy with this product unfortunately!</li>
    <li> I am impressed at week 2.5 smoother supple skin with some fadeing of age spots...hope for more by week 4!&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price.</li>
    <li> HAVE BOUGHT FROM QVC BEFORE</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and frankly retinoids scared me. However, I&#x27;m beginning to get some sun discoloration, small wrinkles around my eyes and occasional adult acne, so I searched for a retinol product that wouldn&#x27;t irritate, with no luck except for this product. I used this a couple of years ago with excellent results, but gave it up for the summer (didn&#x27;t want to wear sunscreen all the time- I know, stupid!) and didn&#x27;t go back. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve tried cheaper products to save money, but they&#x27;ve always ended in disaster- acne, irritated skin and no results. So after my latest disappointment, I decided to come back to Philosophy Miracle Worker. In just two days it has cleared up the mess RoC Correxion made out my skin and left my skin glowing and acne-free! I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in 4 months. I always wear sunscreen when I go outside, which is mandatory with any retinol product. Here&#x27;s a hint for using this product: take out 3/4 of the pads and pour a little bit of the solution over the group still in the container. Put the rest of the pads back 1/4 at a time, continuing to pour 1/4 of the bottle over each group in the container until all the pads are back in the container and all of the solution is on them. Quickly put the inner and outer cover back on, and don&#x27;t open the container in direct light (even indoor lights)to keep the solution fresh and keep it from altering. Before you take one out each night before bed, turn the container upside down a couple of times to get the liquid evenly distributed. The pads will not seem soaked or even wet, but be assured if you&#x27;ve followed these steps you are getting product on your skin. I use 1 pad each night (both sides) on my face, neck, chest, back of hands and knee-area. I cannot say enough good things about this product, and I&#x27;ve found that I actually save money using it because I can get rid of so many other products.</li>
    <li> The best stuff I have ever used on my face, customer for life!! Thank u Theresa Golden for telling me about this💕</li>
    <li> Love how my skin feels,very soft.</li>
    <li> great service and great product.  They follow up the customers concern.  good job.  I will order this product again, and recommend to other friends too.</li>
    <li> Great product and price works good on my skin not the decrease in dark spots and face  looks healthy and smooth</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the high price but if I can find it again &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll get it again.</li>
    <li> I started to see results in about 2 days. Less wrinkles, more blended complexion. My face and neck has a nice healthy glow. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Already seeing a change in the texture and appearance of my skin.  Brown spots diminishing, fine lines fading!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks - 2 or 3 times a week and some one commented about how good my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from a few problems when I started using these.  I had sun damage, huge pores, and rosacea.  Within a few days, I started to notice improvement and within a week, the rosacea was gone - completely gone - and has never come back.  I&#x27;m now on my second bottle, and I&#x27;m seeing a huge difference on my skin tone and pores.  I tried the Miracle Worker cream as a comparison, and for me, the cream doesn&#x27;t work as well as the pads.  They are a little more expensive, but worth it.  My skin damage on my chest has seriously improved to the point where I feel I can now wear lower cut tops again.  I struggled with that problem for years. Thanks Philosophy!</li>
    <li> I read the great reviews on here and thought I&#x27;d give this product a go. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference at huge first which I now think was because the change in my skin was so gradual. Believing it not to be working, I didn&#x27;t re-order the product after my first batch ran out after 60 days. However within a week of stopping use of these pads, the change &#x27;back&#x27; wasn&#x27;t gradual at all! My skin immediately looked duller with the pores and fine lines more defined, and I could see a drastic difference in skin tone, texture and color. I re-ordered these pads and started using them again straight away. I now honestly believe this product really does work and notice how smooth my face is when I apply my makeup. It&#x27;s also great for any breakouts and clears them up much faster than normal with no marks left behind. This is one of the few &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; products I now swear by, and it&#x27;s fantastic being able to get it on Amazon at a fraction of the price of most stores.</li>
    <li> My face looks smoother and feels softer with each use.  I am hooked on this product.  I was so surprised that it works so well because I am sometimes sensitive to retinoid products.  I am almost 65 and this product makes me look firmner everday.  When you use it you can actually feel it working.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I tried using this with a deep moisturizing lotion but it was still very drying and my skin was flaky the next day. I would recommend this product to those who don&#x27;t have dry skin or have found a good moisturizer to use alongside it.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 40s and was regretfully a sun worshipper so my skin is wrinkly and porous for my age. This is my 2nd container of the Retinoid pads. After spending lots of time researching skincare found some great reviews on the Miracle Worker set which includes these pads and concentrate and cream kit. This purchase here was only for the pads. I feel like although it cant get rid of my deep wrinkle lines, it is smoothing out my skin and the texture and I have tried tons of skincare lines! I bought this retinoid separately bc I ran out of this piece first but use this in conjunction with the other 2 pieces that go along with the Miracle Worker set (concentrate and cream). You use at night- first the retinoid pads on clean skin, then a small amount of the concentrate and top it off with the moisturizer. I will continue to buy all of these items again-they feel great on my skin and seems to be helping. A tip to make these pads last that I got from someone else. When you get this you have to pour the retinoid solution onto the pads the very first time. Before doing this I cut the pads in half and it works perfectly so rather than lasting only 60 days worth I get 120 and it is plenty! I even use on my neck and hands before discarding the pad.</li>
    <li> Really helped my daughter with her acne scars. Fast delivery, great product!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff, and has experienced great results after two months of Miracle Worker. She claims that her skin feels much smoother, and that she has noticed a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; about her, which I can confirm. We purchased this product once for $67 with Amazon prime, and again for $45...the price does fluctuate on here so do yourself a favor and use camelcamelcamel to monitor the price and buy it when its cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
    <li> +Yhere was VERY little liquid !  Yhe pads were [ractually dry....very disappointed</li>
    <li> If I could afford it, I&#x27;d get more</li>
    <li> i really like the philosophy products. i started with these pads at night. now i also use the am pads.  i would recommend this product to anybody who&#x27;s concerned with their skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely notice a difference in my skin; it looks softer.  I&#x27;m very pale and have sensitive skin - this didn&#x27;t irritate at all, which is a common occurrence with skin products.  I will be a repeat buyer!</li>
    <li> I use these pads every night and I was so happy to see that Amazon carried them and I didn&#x27;t have to pay so much for them.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff so much, i have some dark spots and this has helped lighten them up a little bit while also getting the benefits of retinol! awesome product.</li>
