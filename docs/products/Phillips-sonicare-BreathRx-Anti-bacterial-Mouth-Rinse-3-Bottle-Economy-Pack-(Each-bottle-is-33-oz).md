    <li> This is for my husband, recommended by his dentist.  It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find, so getting it through Amazon is a blessing.</li>
    <li> THANKS, RECEIVED IN GOOD TIME AND FOR A GOOD PRICE</li>
    <li> I have not seen much result yet.  I will allow some time and a little more usage before conclusion.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, best mouth wash for breath I&#x27;ve ever used.  Decent price when you buy a bulk package like this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product which I&#x27;ve used several years.  Eliminated my bad breath, reduced canker sores in my mouth, and get better plaque score  on dental checkups.</li>
    <li> Great!! Works!! Good deal for bulk since this is all I use now</li>
    <li> different logo but seems to be the same</li>
    <li> I have been used this product for my daily mouth wash for multiple years</li>
    <li> We switched to these after noticing stains (brownish spots) from another brand we were buying in the store. No problems, works great</li>
    <li> great product, best price around.</li>
    <li> this stuff don&#x27;t dry your mouth, works very well, breath stay fresh until next meal. Try it out you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that actually works. At one time Target had it on the shelf but no longer carries this product. Glad it&#x27;s still available and with delivery date stated and received..</li>
    <li> Much better deal than any store for a great product I use every day. I Highly recommend it. A+++ awesome</li>
    <li> This mouth rinse was purchased to be a substitution for another product that was being utilized on a routine basis. So far, this product is a part of my top ten mouth rinse list.  Although rather expensive, I might purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> My dentist gives me this mouth wash with each visit.  I noticed it doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth when I gargle or rinse my mouth with it.  I looked for it in the store but the asking price was steep.  I found buying the economy pack was more price effective, and easier to purchase through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash will get rid of your bad breath and keep your mouth fresh for most of the day</li>
    <li> Absolutely killed the bad breath that was upsetting my wife, when used with the BreathRx tongue scraper (a necessary tool).</li>
    <li> The best mouthwash out there. I didn&#x27;t realize that the was the recommended mouthwash by my density until recently. I tend to do 2/3rd mouthwash to 1/3 water in a small bottle as it&#x27;s a little strong. I love it and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s different about this stuff, but my wife and I both prefer it to the supermarket mouthwash products.  It gives you really fresh breath.  It&#x27;s quite expensive, but you don&#x27;t need to use very much so it lasts quite a while, and is worth the extra cost to me.</li>
    <li> this wass my 3rd order of this mouthwash and the grandkids love using it</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product...Nothing else available on the market that will leave your mouth feeling as clean as BreathRx will.  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Buying three of these is the best price we&#x27;ve found.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing bad breath.</li>
    <li> The best antibacterial mouth wash.  Its the only one we use.</li>
    <li> BreathRX&lt;br /&gt;This is the best Mouth Rinse.  It tastes great and last a long time.  This is a far better price than buying it in the drug store.</li>
    <li> Its just mouth wash that we can&#x27;t buy locally anymore.</li>
    <li> For happy, healthy gums and teeth, I add a capful or two for use with the electric dental pik for a super-fresh, super clean feel to start the day!  Great price for the 3 bottles.  Highly recommended and have used for over 5 ++ years.</li>
    <li> we like using this product and in the future i might buy some more if its a good price. also the toothpaste is very good too.</li>
    <li> I like the taste and my dentist recommends it too.</li>
    <li> Works great, really refreshing mouthwash that last. Once you try this product , you won&#x27;t buy anyother mouthwash. Hands down the best mouthwash.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gotten more expensive since the last time we bought it, but the service is great.</li>
    <li> Among all the mouth rinse I&#x27;ve tried, this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;It might feel a little strong at first but it delivers wonderful result with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;Just a little of it last a whole day.</li>
    <li> This is a BIG bottle set! I love the mouth wash and feel that it making my dental visits better and better. I have continued to purchase it since buying it the first time. I may not use this seller next time, but the product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> damaged when received.</li>
    <li> BreathRx is terrific.  It was recommended by my dental hygienist; it really does take care of bad breath.  I used to be able to buy it in a couple of stores in my area, but is no longer carried by either.  I&#x27;m so glad I can get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Honestly the best mouth wash I have bought. Leaves my breath fresh the whole day as long as I don&#x27;t eat anything that would change that.</li>
    <li> great value shipped fast order came as described.</li>
    <li> Because my dentist and hygentist use BreathRx, when ever I see the 33 oz BreathRx for $10, I BUY it!  And finding a 3-pack for $29.99 was perfect.  It arrived today (one day earlier than expected) and well packaged as a box within another really strong Amazon cardboard box.  I&#x27;ve noticed that in the last couple of weeks that my packages are taped with Black and Blue Amazon Prime Member tape.  Excellent!  Does that tell UPS to hurry up?  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep several bottles of the 33 oz BreathRx on hand to refill the 16 ounce bottles in our bathrooms.  I never use anything but BreathRx.</li>
    <li> Super price on a product my husband and I have been using for years.  As always, shipped as promised.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Best deal I&#x27;ve found for it has been through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good product timely service.</li>
    <li> The 3pack of the large BreathRX bottles do last me about 6 months on average.&lt;br /&gt;Beats going to the store, and buying  one small bottle of this monthly.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Thank You For Prompt Shipping!</li>
    <li> I love this mouth rinse. Very refreshing, yet not too overpowering. Whitens my teeth, too! I wish more places carried it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the recommendation of my dentist as a treatment for gingivitis. He said most mouthwashes on the market are alcohol based antiseptics, but this product is an anti-bacterial. So I continued to floss twice and brush three times per day, using this mouth rinse each time I brushed. After six months my dental gum pockets were deeper than before, and I was also having pain when I brushed. Two months ago I switched to Cepacol from CVS which is also an anti-bacterial, and is also lower priced. Since then, my teeth seem to not be as painful as they used to be. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the Cepacol, or maybe it&#x27;s related to the nasal saline irrigation that I&#x27;ve been doing for the past few weeks to combat a chronic sinus infection. Time will tell I suppose.</li>
    <li> I have gum disease and this product actually helps alleviate some of the pain. My breath seems fresher. It is fairly expensive but I hope the price will come down as more people discover it.</li>
    <li> Best mouth rinse that I have ever used. It is effective and lasts several hours. Was recommended to me by my Dental Hygenist</li>
    <li> This product is worth every dollar.  My husband was the first to try it, but I soon discovered it&#x27;s the next best thing to sliced bread.&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using it, I&#x27;ve shared this information with several of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve all done this before, &amp;#34;Hit your gums to hard with your tooth brush, and then later on the area starts to hurt.&amp;#34;  That is one of&lt;br /&gt;the reasons I use BreathRX.  The painful area is better within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;I always buy the three pack, the price is better than buying one at a time.</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash ever!!</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used.  It really cleans inside your moth and freshens your breath</li>
    <li> Our dentist suggest BreathRx and we both have now used it for 2 years.  It preforms just fine.  The price thru Amazon is significantly ess than we could find anywhere else.</li>
    <li> See my review of this product and Biotene PBF Oral rinse from a year ago. I&#x27;ve been using these products ever since, and the results (cleaner teeth, refreshing breath) continue to be amazing. The 3-pack of BreathRx and the 4-pack of 16oz PBF are cheaper per unit and much less than in the local retail drug store (if available).</li>
    <li> I like it because it is effective without having alcohol that dries the mouth. The downside is that it is expensive, but Amazon ships it for free.</li>
    <li> The best such product I have ever used. I would recommend it to anyone interested in a mouth rinse that last almost all day.</li>
    <li> BreathRx lives up to its promises. Rinsing with an ounce so morning and night (plus brushing, using a proxy brush between teeth and scraping the tongue) does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy this rinse in chain drugstores, but it disappeared from their shelves in 2012. It was also available only in bottles half the size of these. The larger size through Amazon costs the same as the smaller size did in the store. It&#x27;s definitely a better value!</li>
    <li> I have been using BreathRx for the last seven years.  I went away from it for awhile a couple of times and I always came back because it works.</li>
    <li> Our dentist in the Bay Area used it in his dental practice.  I was so impressed with it, I asked him if I could buy a bottle from him.  Of course I couldn&#x27;t because it was only available at that time to dentists.  A few years later I saw it for sale in a drug store and was a&lt;br /&gt;happy customer.  Have been using it ever since.</li>
