      <li>I love this tool and am constantly getting compliments on my hair when I use it!</li>
      <li>The wand gets so hot, which makes styling so much faster, and makes the curls stay that much longer.  </li>
      <li>Please do not buy a cheap hair wand - buy this brand and spend the extra money.  </li>

      <li>would especially not recommend this to those who buying curling iron for the first time.</li>
      <li>(It does get VERY hot to the touch though so be careful when using it)</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 18 year old daughter who has long hair and had been using her roommate&#x27;s Jose Eber wand for a whole semester.</li>
      <li>i received my jose eber curler in good time however instead of the giraffe print that i paid for i only got a plain black one.</li>
      <li>Works really well, the only thing I wish was different was the capability to control the heat setting.</li>
      <li>It is an extremely hot iron so have to be very careful and wear the glove provided.</li>
      <li>It is the second wand I&#x27;ve purchased, the first was from the brand \\&quot;Unplugged\\&quot; and the barrel went from large to small which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>

    <li> This curling iron is unlike any other one that I have used. It curls any hair type without burning it. It leaves the curls looking shiny and healthy and not frizzy. Also, my hair normally wont hold a curl for more than a couple of hours, but with this curling iron it lasts for 2 days…no exaggeration! Highly recommended. (It does get VERY hot to the touch though so be careful when using it)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!  She has long thick hair &amp; this curls it fast &amp; it stays! It is an extremely hot iron so have to be very careful and wear the glove provided.</li>
    <li> I Love this product! Does a great job curling in a short amount of time!!!!  I have really long hair and thought it would take me forever but when I used it, it only took me about 20 minutes!</li>
    <li> I wish that this iron barrel wasn&#x27;t one legnth. Otherwise it is good on my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great, heats up quickly and does a great job! The instructions are okay, watch the video online for better instructions!</li>
    <li> good product. good price. thank you. it was a gift for my nieces, and they liked it. I also have one for me.</li>
    <li> This is my second Jose Eber wand.  The first broke when I dropped it and I felt like crying.  So, I bought the same one.  Please do not buy a cheap hair wand - buy this brand and spend the extra money.  The wand gets so hot, which makes styling so much faster, and makes the curls stay that much longer.  Always use the glove because no matter how much you think you won&#x27;t get burned, you will.  Also, watch a youtube video to get the hang of using this product.  The first few times are really hard and your hair might look funky, but I promise you&#x27;ll perfect it by the 3rd or 4th time.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron.  The glove protects your hand and the iron leaves great curls and gives your hair good body.</li>

    <li> Works really well, the only thing I wish was different was the capability to control the heat setting. The glove is a great idea but personally, it makes it harder for me to manipulate the hair.</li>
    <li> I love this curler! My hair is long, thick and straight, it usually takes me about an hour to curl my hair with just a regular thick curler and the result won&#x27;t last either. But this one works great! It&#x27;s the perfect size and gets hot fast and my curls stay on for 2 day (which has never happened to me before!). Plus the design is so cute! I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I returned this item. Box and content appeared used.</li>
    <li> I would definitely buy this curling iron again.  It get super hot right away and the curl stays in for 2 days no problem.&lt;br /&gt;Besides how great it works, it is super cute.</li>
    <li> it does what it says :)</li>
    <li> With my thick hair no other curling iron could manage a lasting wave. The Jose Eber is amazing! Within seconds a strand of hair magically curls and lasts for days...I would recommend this appliance especailly for the heavy hair types...love it!</li>
    <li> love it. The best ive used</li>
    <li> i was quite excited when i bought this product but it was a big blunder to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;well, First of all i find it really complicated to use and is very time consuming. Secondly, when the curls loose out, my hair just look like a mess. I would rather prefer curling my hair with a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;I would especially not recommend this to those who buying curling iron for the first time.</li>
    <li> i received my jose eber curler in good time however instead of the giraffe print that i paid for i only got a plain black one.</li>
    <li> Makes great and lasting curls.  Easy to use.  I am happy with my purchase.  I would recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> My sister has the same wand, since I loved hers so much I&#x27;m buying my own! It takes practice to master the curls but once you do, you&#x27;ll never get a different curling iron again!&lt;br /&gt;One fault is the cord where it connects to the device can easily be damaged. So take note of how you stop your product if you wrap the cord.</li>
    <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is amazing! It is the second wand I&#x27;ve purchased, the first was from the brand \\&quot;Unplugged\\&quot; and the barrel went from large to small which I didn&#x27;t like. That&#x27;s why I purchased the Jose Eber curling wand after testing out my friend&#x27;s. The curls are amazing, they hold all day with hairspray (and even without) If you are not experienced with using a curling wand, this may be difficult for you but if you know what you&#x27;re doing, it should be very easy! With this curling wand, my curls come out tight, beautiful and shiny even though my hair is extremely damaged from dying it. If you&#x27;re looking for a good wand, this one is for you!(:</li>
    <li> I am using my best friend&#x27;s giraffe print one and the curls in my hair never stay in but when she used this on my hair they stayed in the whole day and the next day with very little hair spray. My hair is very thick. I love it ! This picture is not the best but they looked great.</li>
    <li> Geweldig apperaat, allen er is geen europese stekker gemonteerd , verloop moeten bestellen.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 18 year old daughter who has long hair and had been using her roommate&#x27;s Jose Eber wand for a whole semester. It did not disappoint. She uses it every day.</li>
    <li> Used this for my wedding! Takes a little practice but GREAT curls! Also, maybe practice not burning yourself. :)</li>
