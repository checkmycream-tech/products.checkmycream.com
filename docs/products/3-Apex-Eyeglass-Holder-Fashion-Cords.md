      <li>I got these instead of metal because I&#x27;m allergic to most metals.  </li>
      <li>I ordered a 3-pack, and like them so well that I just ordered 2 more 3-packs.  </li>
      <li>The glasses are hitting at the top of my breast bone.    </li>

      <li>The metal wire-wound cord tensioners are the best devices I&#x27;ve found for this particular application, far superior and simpler than the plastic button tensioners offered by other competing designs.</li>

      <li>The price is certainly right and since I got 3, my husband is using one, too!</li>
      <li>True, they won&#x27;t swing around and perhaps hit something, but...</li>

      <li>These are a quick fix for attaching your glasses to your body.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find eyeglass holder cords here, as I have not been able to find them in any local stores.</li>
      <li>they are nice but like everything else they continue to slip and I am constantly adjusting them !</li>
      <li>so they need to be replaced more frequently.</li>
      <li>They rarely have to be re-tightened.</li>
      <li>Pleased with them so far.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not much to compare to.  Most eye cords due their job. Holds the glasses and they don&#x27;t fall off! 3 in the package just in case! :)</li>
    <li> After only 3 days the plastic holder has expanded to the point that the glasses are constantly slipping.  I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I keep several of these handy and use them whenever I&#x27;m on the water or working at any height, such as cleaning off a roof.</li>
    <li> These work nice but I agree with others who say they should be longer. The ability to adjust the length (one reason I chose these) proves irrelevant because they are already shorter than I like.</li>
    <li> These 3 \\&quot;Fashion Cords\\&quot;  are not very fashionable and are shorter than others I own.  SO I&#x27;ve decided to just use them around the house.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> They tend to stay in place for the most part. Wish there were a bit longer as sometimes you need to pull them around your head and adjust them because they are a bit tight.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and handy.  You get 3 to the page to boot. I certainly recommend them to anyone who needs to carry one or more pairs of glasses</li>
    <li> Before ordering I checked existing reviews, and came away a bit concerned about the cord length. So I asked the seller (through Amazon) to provide the length of the cord, and he did so promptly: 24\\&quot;, about 22\\&quot; usable. I already have a cord 26\\&quot; long, and it seems to me more than adequate, so I ordered. As others have remarked, the product arrives before you can turn around. The 22\\&quot; usable length apparently refers to a 2\\&quot; segment in the middle of the cord that you can tighten to grip glasses closer to your head - so the cord can also be used for what you might call a retainer. The length seems to me no problem whatsoever - my glasses fall loosely to my chest. But any prospective customer can measure off a string 22\\&quot; long and see how it suits them. This is a very good deal, 3 fine looking cords for a price you might otherwise be paying for one. Thumbs way up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the glasses cords--I&#x27;ve never used them before and they are great when I just want to pop the glasses off for awhile!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I like the product and I would recommend to others. I look for good values and I was glad I found this one.</li>
    <li> They are great! Could be a little longer, but do a good job. I like these because they don&#x27;t get caught in my long hair.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these for each of my sunglasses and reading glasses! Makes it convenient and I no longer leave my glasses in restaurants, checking out at stores, etc.</li>
    <li> I just needed something to help me keep my eyeglasses nearby because I only need them for reading and computer work.  My pockets are too small to carry my glasses so something like this was all I needed.  These are very useful and work just fine.  The only thing I would change is to make them just a little longer.  The price is certainly right and since I got 3, my husband is using one, too!</li>
    <li> The plastic loops on the ends of the cord don&#x27;t hold the arms of the glasses very well, so often my glasses just fall off. I try to adjust them tighter, but it still happens. Got a much better one (for more money) at my opticians.</li>
    <li> My wife could never find these at stores but she was delighted when these arrived.</li>
    <li> Not very pretty, but functional.  They have a weird design and at first I couldn&#x27;t figure out how they even worked.  I use them all the time especially at home because if my glasses are around my neck I don&#x27;t have to look for them!  You get what you pay for though.  They&#x27;re not great, but they work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my Apex eyeglass holder; they are obviously most comfortable and I&#x27;ve already begun to use them all the time.</li>
    <li> I removed the crimp on the strap to make it longer. Now they fit well and keep my sunglasses safe. Pleased with them so far.</li>
    <li> These lanyards even at their maximal extension are far too short to be useful. They barely go around my neck. What&#x27;s worse the toggle that enables them to be shortened even further cannot be removed.     I feel I was taken in by the product description that failed to mention length.</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; fine seller.</li>
    <li> These cords are great.  Last ones I had lasted over 4 years! Love the colors.  So glad I could go back to my last order (in 2011) and find these again on Amazon! Hope I can always find them here!  Absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this before from the same merchant, that&#x27;s why I wanted more of the same.&lt;br /&gt;They sent me two black and one blue, the blue one was thinner, then the black one.&lt;br /&gt;Seller screwed up, but then he gave me a credit for the blue one, but I still got stock with two black ones, anothe words I did not get what I order, I hope you are luckier then me.&lt;br /&gt;I have no Brown one.. I really don&#x27;t bet it, are these people high, or they don&#x27;t care what they put in it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish everything was sold by Amazon, not by exterior merchants they are always upsetting.</li>
    <li> Very nice cords. I especially like having three colors, since I&#x27;ve had cataract surgery and must use non-prescription reading glasses. I have different diopters for reading and computer use. The colored cords help me identify the different glasses without trying them on. Computer, blue; reading, black. They seem to be higher quality than the one I use to use.</li>
    <li> I was glad to find eyeglass holder cords here, as I have not been able to find them in any local stores. I use them all the time on all my glasses, to keep from losing them. They seem well made and are reasonable.</li>
    <li> Very decent eyeglass cords, excellent quality, comfort and the three colors go with most everything I wear.  I did my research before purchasing and feel I made the right decision in buying these.</li>
    <li> ...you need these. I don&#x27;t have to grab for my glasses every time I bend over and they slip off. I need to remove my glasses frequently to see close distances-these keep me from losing them when I wander away without them</li>
    <li> Work well to both snug up glasses...to keep them from slipping down your nose...or by lengthening the strap to hand them around your neck without having to take them off an on. The metal wire-wound cord tensioners are the best devices I&#x27;ve found for this particular application, far superior and simpler than the plastic button tensioners offered by other competing designs.</li>
    <li> Although for some reason, the order was sent back and redelivered - it still arrived before the estimated delivery date. The eyeglass holder cords were exactly as advertised and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;m accustomed to Peeper Keepers, some of which last over a year. These break much more easily (the ends that hold the eyeglass bows) so they need to be replaced more frequently. So not the bargain I had hoped.</li>
    <li> The price and color assortment is great.   The ones delivered are a little different from the picture.  They have sort of gaudy gold pieces at the neck and around the loops that fit over the glasses arms.  On the other hand, some of these allow more adjustment to the loops, so that&#x27;s a plus.    I got these instead of metal because I&#x27;m allergic to most metals.  These have metal at the back of the neck, so I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t work out.  But so far the metal parts seem to stay away from the skin.    Mostly I wish these were longer.   True, they won&#x27;t swing around and perhaps hit something, but...I guess I&#x27;m comparing them to others I&#x27;ve had.  The glasses are hitting at the top of my breast bone.    Seller was excellent.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a convenient way to keep up with your glasses that is casual these are perfect.  Not necessarily dressy but perfect for everyday wear and a great value.</li>
    <li> Very handy to own. Now I don&#x27;t have to lose my glasses on top of my head. :-) Great merchant!</li>
    <li> They are great but had to be aware could not push rubber band holders too far up on thicker glasses handles or would break.</li>
    <li> And found these - They are indeed made well, but have dreaded rubbery squeeze-clamp tips that usually don&#x27;t hold the classes on the chest well. Nice pricing at  20% of the Dept. store variety, but we  bought ones that have insert able tips that grasp the glasses well</li>
    <li> Bought these for when we are out on the lake or around water so that I would not lose my glasses in the water.</li>
    <li> not what i thought this was. my mistake i suppose.</li>
    <li> These work just as advertised and at an awesome price.  I disagree with the reviewer who said they slip off.  Once you slip them on to your glasses, you need to tighten then down by pushing up the spring that holds it tight against your eyeglasses.  Once you do that, they stay put.  Also, the lanyard is plenty long and is nicely adjustable too.  I say get them!</li>
    <li> I have been looking everywhere for these and was very pleased to find a set of three so inexpensive and well made.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Good value.  Use them daily.</li>
    <li> This has saved many pairs of glasses(reading and sun). Works very well and looks good. Very well made product and designed product. Bought also for my wife as she has lost a few pairs of sun glasses while kayaking. This will make a great stocking stuffer at Christmas.</li>
    <li> For a friend who is always losing her glasses.  Perfect</li>
    <li> Handy 3-pack at a great price.  These eyeglass cords are lightweight, adjustable and in good basic colors.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty simple cord but it is exactly what I was looking for. Not to visible, not to width, practical and easy to put on...it is just great. Also, I must point out that it is of very good quality.</li>
    <li> These are great--good quality, strong, don&#x27;t slip off if you make the loop tight.</li>
    <li> These things come in handy when you are someone that is always loosing their glasses. The holders stay snug on the temples so they don&#x27;t slide up and down. Good price for a good product.</li>
    <li> This came quickly.  They aren&#x27;t fancy, but they are as advertised and inexpensive.  Used to be optometrists had these to give away, but they are harder to find.  I looked in the &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; section of a few pharmacies where I found reading glasses, repair kits, and other stuff, but no eyeglass chains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to take your glasses on and off during the day and don&#x27;t want to lose them, this will do the trick.</li>
    <li> I got these at a great price. I needed them for walking 5-7 miles a day and when ever I do work outside. They do better than I thought they would do.</li>
    <li> Like these a lot.  They are nice and washable.  However, they have an adjustable section in the back that kind of bother&#x27;s him.  However, if you wear with a shirt with a collar, they are great.</li>
    <li> They work for my glasses</li>
    <li> I have many pairs of reading glasses and in order not to misplace them I use these. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because I find it a little short. But the price was awesome, as in most Amazon products</li>
    <li> Excellent as expected.</li>
    <li> These work fine as far as holding glasses are concerned, but a major manufacturing flaw makes them less than acceptable.  Where the two ends meet in the back of the head, there is a groove that hair get caught in..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at some of the negative reviews. I&#x27;ve been using these cords for years. The plastic retainer will eventually break, but not for a long time even with heavy use. The one I&#x27;m currently using has lasted for almost a year. I just misplaced it (not the glasses, the cord). It will turn up. At the low price for three, keep a some around and buy new ones every few years. The only problem is that they are a little short. I&#x27;m 6-3 and they reach to about mid-sternum. A good buy.</li>
    <li> These eyeglass holders do a good job of staying on and keeping eyeglasses close at hand.  They rarely have to be re-tightened.</li>
    <li> These are a quick fix for attaching your glasses to your body. They are effective and utilitarian. I wouldn&#x27;t use them for outdoor activities like gardening or sports.</li>
    <li> I found these to be next to useless.  The \\&quot;elastic\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t hold up for more than a few days.  It stretches out very quickly, then the glasses or either hanging from one side or end up on the floor.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Cord has an elasticisty that makes it perfect, with no straining and breaking.  perfect for anyone active.  Good quality also.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these in the market anywhere.  Just the &amp;#34;frog type&amp;#34;  that keep them constantly on your nose.  It would be nice if, in addition to the three colors, we could get all of one color: black.</li>
    <li> The quality is fairly good, I like the fact that you get a choice of colors. I was tired of constantly looking for my glasses because I was leaving them every where. Now, They&#x27;re always around my neck no need to go looking for them. Does the job, I do like eyeglass chains, so I decided to try these more comfortable then have your hair getting stuck in eyeglass chain holders. I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone who is tired of looking for their eyeglasses!</li>
    <li> Paid $9 for this. Good product, but not too good priced since I have to buy 3 at a time..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need glasses all the time but can&#x27;t find my glasses so this is a God send.  I love them and I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without them.  I am not spending all day looking for my reading glasses or losing them in a pocket somewhere.</li>
    <li> IF i had an issue or problem we would have already made contact don&#x27;t have time to type a twenty work comment on so if you want my rate try to get it in one or as i fell like putting in.&lt;br /&gt;consider this the same comment on the rest of my items too.</li>
    <li> These were purchased for my hubby who misplaces his reading glasses about 12 times a day. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought these cords would cure that problem for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, they help when he remembers to wear a pair of corded glasses...that&#x27;s good, right? :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price was decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for those who misplace their glasses on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> they are nice but like everything else they continue to slip and I am constantly adjusting them ! -- Just fair - ok for the price I suppose</li>
    <li> i only wear my glasses for seeing distances so as a result, I&#x27;m taking my glasses on and off a lot and constantly putting them down and losing them.  These work perfect for keeping my glasses around my neck and now I never lose them!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive way to hold your glasses from hitting the ground. They seem to work and are well made. They just look cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband.  I liked the fact that there were 3 different colors in the pack and the cost was reasonable.  He wanted the little rubber gripper attachments that attached to the ear pieces.  Unfortunately, he has only worn 1 of them and the gripper is not staying tight around.  I do not think I would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> this is a nice set for the price but they dont last long and on smooth frames they slip alot so look elsewhere but if need be for the price you can really go wrong</li>
    <li> These holders arrived well packaged and in good shape. They work well, and are easy to put on the glasses. It is a handy way to let your glasses dangle if you need to remove them.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy but just what I was looking for.  Didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money and these fit perfectly.  Can keep my readers with me at all times.</li>
    <li> Bad... not recomended.</li>
    <li> would order more in a heart beat--got good service from this product..</li>
    <li> 1) The cords are high quality. The material has a nice feel to it. This will not snag on clothing. This will not snap, break, or fray.&lt;br /&gt;2) The ear loops are nonslip and rubbery. They will grip the temple arms of the glasses without scratching them or falling off.&lt;br /&gt;3) The ear loops can be adjusted to fit any size temple arm perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;4) There is another adjustment on the cord itself to adjust the length of the cord on the neck. This allows the glasses, when hanging around the neck, to hang higher or lower.&lt;br /&gt;5) The color choices are good, especially if you have a black, brown, and blue set of glasses. The blue cord also matches well with gold and silver frames.</li>
    <li> I ordered a 3-pack, and like them so well that I just ordered 2 more 3-packs.  It&#x27;s hard to find normal, plain cords for reading glasses, and these are inexpensive to boot.  Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for--- a simple old fashioned eyeglass cord. No frills-- just plain useful. Well made product.</li>
    <li> The design of the holder hook is wrong.  It does not grip tight to the frame and hence it does not serve its purpose.  It is also very fragile.  Hence all of it broken very quickly</li>
    <li> Looks nice. Does the job well. Excellent price. Easy to install on the glasses. What else would you want? recommended!</li>
    <li> These eyeglass holders are terrible, I have tried all three and all three do not hold my glasses.  I do wear heavy glasses, so the weight of the glasses were not they problem.  They have dropped from one side of the glasses and have fallen on the floor in my house, the supermarket when I was shopping, and in my car while driving.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Thank you, Edna Robbins</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product is not very functional. The rubber tips that hold the glasses are too slick because of the type of plastic that is used. No amount of tightening with the metal fitters will hold the cord in place on the frame. If you use these, you&#x27;ll constantly have to adjust them.  I&#x27;m going back to my well proven glass holder, the Chums Orbiter Eyewear Retainer. They cost a little more but nothing outragous. Got mine for $10 and have been using it for over 2 years. I use them on my sun glasses. I don&#x27;t know why I tried these cords. The reason I went with the wire style is because the cloth one&#x27;s get sticky in the summer.</li>
