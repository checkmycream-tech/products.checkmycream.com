<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product! Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I replaced the exact same waterpik so this was not new to me. I find it a little sluggish from time to time, but it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> Good until it broke less than a year after buying.</li>
    <li> Had mine for about two years now, use it at least every other day. Battery still holds a good charge and my dentist tells me to keep using it because my receding gums have improved. Would give it five stars if it held more water.</li>
    <li> Yes - it is my dental assistant who talked me into buying this gadget.  I guess, waterflosser is great for preventing plaque build up and it is more effective than regualr gflossing and mouthwash alone.  But with all three combined, your teeth and gums will really be happy.  I find tool to be a bit awkward and I do not like the fact that takes up precious space I need on my bathroom sink for things like skin care necessities.  But for anyone who wants to have Jerry Seinfeld set of white pearly teeth, this is a must have tool.</li>
    <li> Weak pump.  Not as forceful as the last model I&#x27;d purchased.</li>
    <li> I still have this four 7 years.</li>
    <li> It is a must for me to floss daily. It is easy and accurate.</li>
    <li> Handy for travel but I prefer the non-portable models for home use.</li>
    <li> It is quite difficult to use it because of water splashing, but it seems is working as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marco Farah</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT, FAST SHIPPING</li>
    <li> I bought 2 and they both broken after about a month.  Choose a different item.</li>
    <li> I bought it for My sister in a nursing home. She said it works fine.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Love it&#x27;s portablity</li>
    <li> Does not work unless it is perpendicular to the ground, if it is on a 45 degree angle to the ground or less, then it would not spray water but only air at your teeth and gum, therefore it is useless because how the Hell you are going to use it on your teeth around your mouth while maintaining it in a  perpendicular position to the ground, especially when you do your lower front teeth on the inside.....it is just laughable......&lt;br /&gt;If you really need one do not buy the cordless one with a built in tank, just buy the one that only works when is connected to a power outlet, and which has a stationary tank that is connected to the tip through a tiny hose.</li>
    <li> This works really well and was just the thing to help my son keep his teeth clean after getting braces. A good value.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as the 110V version. Won&#x27;t work upside down. But does a good job.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Water comes pretty fast.  Best used in the shower so the water can just come and you don&#x27;t make a mess.  But otherwise it&#x27;s good quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel and guess it will do, but I was disappointed at how fast it empties compared to my full-sized unit that I use every day.  It is also awkward to use while trying to hold it upright.  if you don&#x27;t hold it upright, it stops pulsing and makes a buzzing noise.</li>
    <li> You have to be motivated to work on your gums with this device although I believe it does help.  However, keep your body well over the sink and be prepared for some water splattering.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers - the rechargeable battery doesn&#x27;t hold up and that makes the device useless.  I have cell phone and cordless phones with rechargeable batteries that have lasted YEARS and years.  This one won&#x27;t last a year and it is non-replaceable.  The concept is great and when it worked we loved it, just they have to do something with the battery.  I am sad that Waterpik would put something like this out.  Again, it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to use a rechargeable battery that lasts longer than a year.  Sad.</li>
    <li> Am pleased with this purchase. Does exactly what I expected.Good value for the money. Bought a second one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Perfect for using in the shower, I&#x27;m a fan!  My dentist suggested it after suffering from periodontal disease.  It has two different pik heads.  Does get pretty messy when only used in the sink, but I just keep mine in the shower and charge every other day.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the fourth one I&#x27;ve owned and the batteries to not stay recharged for long.  They don&#x27;t have any competitors so I have to keep buying this particular one.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik  Waterflosser motor went out within 45 days of buying it. And I mailed the item back to the seller, I even wrote the seller (Amazon.com), and I never, never did receive another Waterpik Waterflosser up to this day.  I have ordered 3 of the Waterpik Waterflosser from the same seller (Amazon.com) and all 3 of the Waterpik went out on me each time in the limit of 45 days. within 6 months. I am still disappointed up to this day, simply because I should have received refund back or another Waterpik Waterflosser. And I did not received either, or.</li>
    <li> The water flosser works well and takes very little room on the sink which is great because I don&#x27;t have a counter around the sink.</li>
    <li> My Sonicare flosser died after 6 months. With the Sonicare you have to press the button and press again and again for each squirt. Also I would have to fill the water chamber 4 times to do my mouth. So now I switched to the waterpic 360w. Purchased from Kmart for about 10 dollars more (should of checked amazon) Anyway charged it over night per directions, filled the water chamber, inserted the high pressure wand, and WOW this unit has more pressure than the sonic care, only had to fill the chamber twice to do my whole mouth and just press the on button once and away it goes. Great Unit !!!! my mouth has never been this clean unless I go the dentist! Love this unit. I don&#x27;t care if the battery goes in 8 months to a year. The unit only costs twenty bucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Just ordered another one (this time on Amazon). My wife will love it! Because there are so many mixed reviews on this unit I decided to go to waterpic&#x27;s website and see if I can find the solution to the battery problem that so many people have written about. I think I found it. Waterpic, states that their W360 portable flosser can be plugged in when not in use. I&#x27;m doing exactly that. My thoughts are that they have a lithium battery and if the charge gets too low the battery will not snap back and charge. This can happen on many lithium battery&#x27;s, it happened on my worx tool kit. Anyway time will tell, meanwhile I can honestly say this unit so far, is the best portable flosser I have ever used to date. Powerful , quiet , easy to fill. Great unit!</li>
    <li> I really like this waterpik.  It is everything I wanted and more.  Thanks so much for having what I wanted</li>
    <li> I wanted this to clean my back teeth as they grew in, and it worked fine for a while. However, the battery stopped charging after 6 weeks. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> same review as waterpik need info for brother how to get. forgot how good they make you teeth feel great</li>
    <li> This would be a great product if it would work as it should. I&#x27;ve been through two now. The battery is not strong enough in the first place, then the battery dies soon. What&#x27;s the use? I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> the 1st one lasted less than 1 month; the tip kept flying across the bathroom even after repeatedly making sure it was seated with a \\&quot;click\\&quot;. the Company replaced it with \\&quot;no questions asked\\&quot; The replacement just died after about 10 months- not bad according to some of the other reviews. The pump output is greatly diminished when the tip is inserted. I tried cleaning the system with peroxide, then vinegar and replaced the tip- to no avail. Landfill. Perhaps there was a bad manufacturing run, but am not going to try again.</li>
    <li> This is my first device of this nature and I really did not know what to buy, so the flexibility of having a battery powered unit was appealing.  I thought that would offset the smaller tank size.  What a mistake.  I have to refill the tank 3-4 times to do my teeth and the unit is soaked completely by the time I am finished which can&#x27;t be good for it long term.  Also, for the price paid I expected more.  I replaced this one immediately with a Conair Interplak Water Jet for $10 (vs. $35 for the Water Pik).  If you have to get a Water Pik because of the name, get the large unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these units and both have the same problem.  After about 6 months, the rechargable battery stops charging and you have to use the cord permanently.  I&#x27;m going to try Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I loved this portable water pik for many months.  Then it just died.  I thought I&#x27;d done it, that I&#x27;d clogged a tube or something.  After reading reviews of this product which illuminate a history of battery failure, I discovered it was not my fault after all. Should have done some research before buying.</li>
    <li> Did the job fantastically for the first 6 months then it gradually started to die. After 11 months I read it it&#x27;s last rites and chunked it in the garbage can . I&#x27;d buy another one, if it was under $20.00 like I paid for this one, knowing that it&#x27;s a throw away item after 11 months.  Rated it 4 stars because I was very pleased with the product while it worked.</li>
    <li> this is a replacement, wouldnt be without it, probably the only choice when it comes to waterpik u can use in the shower.....</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me this Waterpik -- a wonderful gesture, to help me care for my hard-to-floss teeth.  I charged the battery up, and for the first week, it was a great tool for dental hygiene.  Super clean teeth, no kidding.      I followed the instructions to the letter regarding the care and feeding of this device, but within 2 weeks (after the second time I charged it up), it stopped charging when I plugged it in -- wouldn&#x27;t charge at all.  I mean, literally.    Since it stopped working so quickly, I contacted WaterPik and told them the problem.  I had noticed  what I perceived to be a design flaw:  The little rubber flap that covers the opening where you plug the charger into the device opens from the top.  Perhaps if it opened from the bottom, water wouldn&#x27;t get in it so easily and corrode the poor thing.  But corroded it was, half a month after I opened the brand-new package (When I mentioned this to the fine folks at Waterpik, they told me it was a great design, that water couldn&#x27;t corrode it, and that it was evidently my thinking that was flawed).  For some reason, their reasoning thus left me feeling insulted.    They were willing to send me a free replacement -- all I needed to do was send them my original receipt.    I explained (again, since I mentioned it in my original communication with them) that it was a gift from my dentist; I did not have the receipt.    They responded, telling me I needed to tell the dentist to give me the original receipt.  Excuse me??  Were they kidding??  TELL him to give it to me?    I explained to them I&#x27;m not in the habit of asking my doctors and dentists to open up their accounts payable for my review or ask them to show me paid receipts for what they buy.  I said I was willing to send the device back to them, with the original box, instructions etc. so I could prove I wasn&#x27;t just trying to get something for nothing but just wanted what I believed to be a defective product replaced.    After hemming and hawing for about a month they finally agreed to send me a replacement.  They didn&#x27;t want me to return the defective one, they said.  And 2 weeks later, I did receive a replacement.  It came with a clear caveat:  Since this one replaced a defective one, there was NO GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY for the product.    I charged the new one up, and it worked fine for about a month. Well, guess what.... yep, it won&#x27;t hold a charge.  It&#x27;s not a quality product, and that&#x27;s a fact.    When I first used the first one, I liked it so much I was ready to run out and buy some to give as gifts to family and friends.... boy am I glad I didn&#x27;t!  I&#x27;ve gone through enough headaches with this piece of garbage that I&#x27;ll never buy one.  I&#x27;ll use a plug-in Waterpic model, or another manufacturer&#x27;s product. (Maybe somebody out there makes a cordless rechargeable oral irrigation/floss system that doesn&#x27;t fail so quickly?)</li>
    <li> This is a little awkward to use, I feel the design could be better but it is amazingly effective - even after brushing and flossing.  I recommend it to anyone who has had gum problems.</li>
    <li> A great product.  Have been using this for years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item without reading the previous reviews... MISTAKE, MISTAKE, MISTAKE.    As others reported using different words, this cordless device is a RIP-off, ergo Waterpik RIP.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This device is only good if you have no teeth because the pressure is inferior except to get the gingiva wet with a pressure at an ineffective, worthless level.    The corded model, which is older than the cordless model I have been using, works well.  Too bad there is no ZERO star rating; better yet a minus star rating.</li>
    <li> I bought a different model waterpik and have been very disappointed with the device&#x27;s tips quality.  The tips are extremely fragile. if the device tips over, they WILL break.  Mine broke within 2 days.  I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips. I will never buy another waterpik product.</li>
    <li> The punch line first:  get the electric model rather than the cordless rechargeable.  I bought the WP-360W and really had no complaints the first month -- I&#x27;d charge it,  use it a couple days,  then recharge it.  After a month it was on the charger constantly.  After 4 months,  it died completely.  I called Waterpik and they were willing to replace it but I elected to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to the electric model---and I&#x27;m really really glad I did.     I&#x27;m all for portable and cordless ( Phones,  computer, ipod, etc.);  but sometimes electric just works a lot better than battery---- and power washers,  air compressors ,  and waterpiks are examples.  I&#x27;m sure there are a few of you  that are on the road 5 days a week and don&#x27;t want to lug the electric model around with you.  But if your buying for home use,  it would be hard to convince me the electric isn&#x27;t the smart buy.  After 4 months,  the electric is still working with more force than the cordless had initially.  The hand unit with nozzle is smaller and easier to maneuver around the mouth than the cordless with the water container attached. The electic is easier to keep clean --my opinion.   The power cord and water tube to the handle are plenty long to get your mouth over the sink as long as you have at least one outlet near your sink / vanity.  ( If you have a pedestal sink then you may have a problem)  The water tank is plenty big to waterpik the front and back of all teeth a couple times.     One star for the cordless,  5 stars for the electric</li>
    <li> This is a well designed product that works well to clean between teeth.   Compared to other similar products I have had this one is small which encourages use.   I took off one star because I have not been able to keep the top part stationary in my mouth.  It still works fine, though</li>
    <li> I bought this pik as recommended by my dentist 3 months ago.  I loved it and was very pleased with its performance, however...it only lasted 3 months.  Now it will not turn on when the on button is engaged.  I have a feeling it is because of the design of the on/off buttons.  I ordered the bigger one with the reservoir to replace it, hoping that that one will not crater so quickly.  It&#x27;s a good product, but the company needs to work on its longevity.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0002AHY6Q Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W]]    The Waterflosser comes with two picks; one doesn&#x27;t produce enough water pressure to clean - the other creates a flow so strong that it can painfully separate the gum from the tooth creating the scenario for gum disease. The reservoir is so small that it needs to be filled about four times to clean upper and lower teeth. Cumbersome and uncomfortable to use.... need to be a contortionist to avoid wetting arm and clothing. By the time you find the right angle to shoot water at the spot you need to clean, the reservoir needs refilling. Have to be careful to dry out the hole where the charger wire gets connected, otherwise the accumulated water might bridge the two electrical poles and short out the Flosser. The motor changes speed constantly, giving the impression the energy is low although the battery is fully charged.       I will go back to the Conair WJ7B Interplak Water Jet that I used for years. The pressure adjusts accurately with a dial and the amount of water held by the reservoir is perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought two. Both of them wore out in aprox. two months. I will never by a Waterpik product again. I&#x27;m going with a Phillips Sonicare unit, more expensive but I trust their quality.</li>
    <li> My 3rd replacement over 10+ years.I am happy with the Waterpik and this one seems more durable tan previous models.</li>
    <li> I have purchased recently and I am happy with the purchase. I have a older device of the same unit and it stopped working. I like this better than the older model.</li>
    <li> The product is very convenient to take on trips and very helpful while I am going through the Invisalign treatment.  However, the short life of the battery is very annoying. It basically makes the product very expensive, as it needs to be replaced frequently.  A competitor needs to step forward with one that actually has a battery with an acceptable life span.</li>
    <li> Water power is good and easy to use. Easy to poor water from the top.</li>
    <li> This is the third Waterflosser I have owned over the past 3 years. These last about a year - has good water pressure and overall very durable. After owning my first Waterpik, I could not imagine not having this as part of my everyday dental hygiene routine.</li>
    <li> Bulky and cumbersome. The tank is does not hold enough water. You have to hold it upright in order for it to work which makes it very hard to rinse the inside of your lower teeth.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister and she just loves it!  It&#x27;s exactly what she needed.</li>
    <li> Everything that has already been written is true:   --battery runs out of juice too quickly  --noticeable decrement in performance very soon after \\&quot;full charging\\&quot;  --has to be refilled many times during a single use  --have to be wary of angle or mechanism doesn&#x27;t function properly/will spill(chamber doesn&#x27;t stay closed)  --isn&#x27;t waterproof(ironic, seeing how it will be used in the bathroom, if not the shower)  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is really cheap(the cheapest I could find), but I will be spending my money on something better for my next one.</li>
    <li> The waterpick does the job.  It took some time to get used to and it is messy to use, but the dentist who recommended it told me to expect this.  I had trouble recharging it because one should not recharge while the pik is on.  It took me a couple of times to realize that the pik does not turn off automatically when the battery runs down.  Be sure to click the off button before charging.  Otherwise, it does the job!</li>
    <li> Great product for two months then would not recharge.  When it would still recharge was much better than string flossing.  Ability to  mix in mouthwash was great. Overall it would  be a keeper if it would actually keep working but alas was a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> just for the review \\&quot;record\\&quot; as i am currently upgrading to a differnt waterpik model. i bought this model in 03 and it is still plugged in all day everyday on my bath counter and works fine everyday. its not QUITE as pwerful as it was (maybe) but since i am not even certain about that (as i have no way to tell after all these years!) i will say that the unit has perfomed flawlessly for me in the fashion in which i use it. i use one fill and usually after i floss and i add peroxide to the water mix. i have taken it on trips a few times and it has held its charge tho i always take the cord with me to recharge should it need it. i must have got a GREAT one cause i sure love it!</li>
    <li> After a few weeks, you&#x27;ll need to replace it because even if you charge the battery every night, it just looses so much power it becomes useless</li>
    <li> Terrific pressure actually is somewhat more effective than the large tank style devices and it&#x27;s cordless and so portable!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this because I thought it would be more powerful and better than the Conair that I had. It is more powerful but the water reservoir is so small that you must keep refilling it again and again if you are going to do as the instructions suggest and spent 5 seconds on each tooth. The water reservoir is less than half the size of the Conair that I already had and it probably empties in around 5 seconds! After refilling and refilling and refilling I put this thing back in the box and shoved it away, I went back to using my Conair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d always brushed and flossed well, but I had been having problems with periodontal disease.  I asked my dentist what I was doing wrong and he said, \\&quot;Nothing in particular, you&#x27;re just getting old\\&quot;.    Great.    I figured trying a water pik in addition to brushing/flossing couldn&#x27;t hurt, so I picked this one up.  WOW, it made a huge difference!  After using it for four months, I went in for a checkup.  My gums looked great and the gum pockets had all shrunk.  My hygenist was really surprised, too...I don&#x27;t think she expected it to work so well.  They even moved me back onto a two times per year checkup schedule (I had been on three per year because of the aforementioned problems).  So at least in my case, I can say it definitely works well.    I have to refill the reservoir once to clean my whole mouth, which doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Although I haven&#x27;t had any major power problems, the battery life is a little poor...maybe about five days on average before a recharge.  However, it&#x27;s worth it to me not to have a big, plug-in thing on the counter.</li>
    <li> I bought this waterpik to use between my counter top model time and to use when traveling.  It works perfectly and is a perfect size</li>
    <li> Battery dies after about a month. Water resevoir too small. Power button next to the tip eject button.</li>
    <li> Requirement from my dentist for cleaning a bridge motivated my purchase initially. Ease of use combined with the lack of an appliance connected to electricity when in use turned out to be a pleasure. Its fun to use so I actually use it more often.</li>
    <li> A pile of junk.  Poor charging.  Poor power.  Too quick to run out of water.</li>
    <li> One lasted 6 months, the second one lasted 6 weeks.  Will not buy another one to last 6 days. Seems a shame insofar as Water Pic is the brand name for this type of product. Also too bad as I really need one but one that works.  The actual problem in both cases is either it will not hold a charge or the switch does not work. In any case don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  works easily, does a great job.</li>
    <li> What we got here is a bimodal distribution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People either sing the praises of the \\&quot;Water Jet,\\&quot; or wish to relegate it to the dung heap of poorly designed consumables.  Who&#x27;s right? While there&#x27;s no one answer to that, here are some things you might want to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Portability. The unit is rechargeable, and doesn&#x27;t use a cord, thus increasing its portability and ease of use. It&#x27;s also much smaller and more discreet than the traditional water piks that work with a reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Professional recommendations. Dentists and dental hygienists recommend it, and it apparently does improve oral hygiene.  It removes things that brushing often leaves behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Two types of heads.  Here, two heads are better than one.  Water pik varies the diameter of the flow-thru attachment to achieve either gentle or not-as-gentle pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Price.  Definitely a good deal, especially on sale, and compared to similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The MOST frequent complaint here is that the unit eventaully won;t recharge, and that happened to me as well.  However, this was not after 3 weeks or 3 months, but after about a year of use. That&#x27;s annoying, but what&#x27;s even more annoying is that the \\&quot;water jet\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t HOLD a charge for very long. After just a few uses, you&#x27;ll need to plug it in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANother frequent complaint is that the internal reservoir is so small you have to fill it several times to clean your entire mouth.  Again, this was my experience, but (again), it was not as bad as what some people have written.  If I hurried, I could do it in one filling, but for a fairly thorough job, it does take two.  Not terrible, as long as it keeps working (see paragraph above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Professional recommendation.  When this first came out, it had great appeal as a portable and easy-to-store device that cleaned--floss-like--in difficult areas around the gums.  However, it&#x27;s now apparent there are some longterm problems, especially with the batteries.  Now, competition looms in the form of a similar (non-rechargeable) unit from Panasonic.  If costs more, but if it produces similar results without the problems, I&#x27;m pretty sure dentists will recommend it as well (or instead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Two heads.  NOt a bad idea, although many people will find that they use only the higher pressure nozzle.  However, if your gums are sensitive, you may want to work your way up from lower to higher.  Basically, a good idea, especially since the price is so low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Price.  On sale for about $20, this is potentially a very cost efficient way to reduce your dental bills.  However, one must balance that against the many reviewers who have registered complaints about the batteries, etc.  The Panasonice is about 50% more expensive, and has the same small reservoir problem.  However, if it proves more reliable, this will be the one to get.  And that&#x27;s my recommendation: Look at the competition (the Panasonic), and see what kind of reviews it gets.  ALso, consider whether it would really be so bad (and, practically speaking, if you have the room) to have the traditional style water jet (whatever the brand) which plugs into the wall and has an external reservoir.it&#x27;s now apparent there are some longterm problems, especially with the batteries.

    <li> One of my teeth has my dentist calls a \\&quot;deep pocket.\\&quot; It&#x27;s caused by the bone structure of my teeth, and the only way it can be cleaned is with a Waterpik.  Brushing and flossing all day won&#x27;t do it.  I am my dentist&#x27;s \\&quot;poster child\\&quot; for successfully sustaining a recovery from severe gingivitis. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Occasionally I travel for business.  I bought a battery-powered travel model but it just didn&#x27;t have the oomph, and so have been actually checking a larger bag on the airline instead of using a carryon, specifically to lug the full sized Waterpik along so as not to miss a single night of dental hygiene. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The outstanding feature is this model is that it is portable.  Even the charger is quite small.  After reading all these reviews, it looks like it will be better to use it just for traveling and keep using the countertop one for everyday. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks everyone who wrote a review.</li>
    <li> This is the second one that I have had.  I use it every day, and the first one that I had lasted almost two years.  At the price you can&#x27;t beat this product. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have used a standard (plug-in) Waterpik for years, and had excellent results (and my dentist is full of praise for it).  I have also given them to other members of the family and friends, and everyone seems delighted with them.  I bought the cordless model only for travel, and, while it is better than nothing, it is certainly no match for the standard model.  The pressure is not as high, and the water reservoir is so small that I have to refill it at least twice.  To be fair to Waterpik, these problems are probably unavoidable:  higher pressure equals shorter battery life, and greater reservoir capacity equals cumbersome and difficult to manipulate.  So the cordless model is a slightly unsatisfactory compromise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My strong recommendation is to use the standard model at home, and the cordless one only when traveling.  This limited use might also help avoid some of the battery problems other people have experienced;  certainly I haven&#x27;t had any yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed and benefitted from Water Piks for about 25 years.  The older, clunkier models were often much longer lasting, and although heavy and bulky, they outperformed the more recent ones.  Maybe the recent ones are made in China; i don&#x27;t know that. &lt;br /&gt;This traveling unit is sleek, modern, clever, but not powerful enough for my taste.  And one of the 3 I bought had a fault in the charger and so I&#x27;m returning it as I write this. &lt;br /&gt;The price is a plus, so you can buy more than one and use it as a base unit as well as a traveling unit.</li>
    <li> After my dentist told me I had gum disease, I got this water pik. A recent followup visit showed slight improvement. And it does a great job of cleaning out food trapped under my crown. I&#x27;ve been using it 1x daily for about 2 months.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts me about a week before it starts to slow down.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the WaterPik WP-360W.  My dentist advised the use of a dental water jet and the WaterPik does a great job.</li>
    <li> It seems that these products last about a year, then it is time for a new one.  However, they work well in addition to flossing and brushing to keep my gum disease at bay -- my dentist says we are winning the battle.  Good delivery time by Amazon and a fair price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this waterpik for about a year and a half.  After about 6 months the power diminishes and no longer charges well.  Add another 6 months to a year and it no longer works unless I shake  it to get the motor going.  If you purchase it, I would do so with the expectation that it&#x27;s going to last for about 1 year.</li>
    <li> I just bought one of these. I had used a Waterpik in the past and loved it. The type I used before had a base with a tank that you put water in. There was a hose with a jet head on the end. It held lots of water, the water pressure could be adjusted, and the jet head could be manipulated to reach all your teeth. This model waterpik is not like the good old style. First, it has a tiny little water resevoir that has to be filled about three times to get the job done. The resevoir is too bulky to fit under the spigot of my bathroom sink, so I have to keep walking over to the bathtub to refill it. The unit itself is chunky and hard to hold onto. It has to be held up straight, so therefore it is imposible to aim the water jet to the back teeth.     I called the company because the instruction book said that it had a 14 day return for full refund if not completely satisfied. The operator that I spoke to was very friendly, but seemed to not have much info on the return policy. I wanted the address of where to send the useless thing back. He said to take it back to the store that I bought it from. If they don&#x27;t take it back, then send it in. I asked for an address and he had to rumage around until he found a business card in his pocket to get the address. He said they would refund the entire purchase price, but not the postage that I would have to spend to send it back.     My advice, stay far away from this model Waterpik. Buy one of the old style with the base and bowl style water resevoir. Of course this would make a good gift for someone you realy don&#x27;t like, but are obligated to give a gift to.</li>
    <li> This portable waterpik is much better than I expected.  It has plenty of power and is easy to use.  The water tank must be refilled a couple of times, and you can&#x27;t use every angle, but that is okay.  I am happy to have it with me on along trip.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this water-pic without having seen it \\&quot;in person\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s kind of bulky, but works well, and you must remember that the water comes out pretty fast so do this over the sink with your mouth slightly open, or you&#x27;ll drown!!  Well, not really, but your mouth can fill up really fast!  It does the job well, though, as advertised!</li>
    <li> It has less speed of water and dosn&#x27;t do the job. It also only hold small amount of water. You need to refill several times to finish whole mouth.</li>
    <li> I have had four of these appliances -- none work longer than a few months.  It&#x27;s a great idea, but they don&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> 1. It is portable, so I can take it into the washroom at work and clean my teeth, but easy to keep secure in my locker.&lt;br /&gt;2. It works very well getting stuff out from between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;3. I have to fill it up at least twice, each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;4. I have to use warm water, otherwise it makes my teeth hurt.&lt;br /&gt; The charger was a little iffy to start with, but I was able to figure out how to get the plug in the socket just right so it will charge properly. It would be nice to be able to tell if it is charging, like so many other cordless devices, by having an LED indicator.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers, I was initially impressed with this.  I too remember the bulky, sink top unit I used in the 70&#x27;s.  After oral surgery recently, I asked the dentist how to prevent the ocurrance, and he recommended a Waterpik.   I travel a lot, so I bought the portable.  After just about six months of use, my unit died last night.  It sounds like the impeller (part of the pump) sheared a pin, so all I get is a high pitched whine from it...  These are my observations:    Battery life is not great, but acceptable.  I noticed a perceptible decrease in performance after 4 or 5 days of using the unit without recharging.  It&#x27;s a pain to have to travel with the adapter so you can recharge this thing in the hotel all the time.      Water volume and pressure were very good, so no complaints there.  It really does clean the gum line and other areas very well, so doing this cleaning ritual is very important to oral health.  It is very important to read the instructions on the proper use of this thing, or you&#x27;ll do more harm than good.    Reservoir size is small, but that is the price to pay for a travel sized unit. Waterpik does include a two (2) year warranty, but you must have the original receipt for warranty service.  After reading other reviews, I&#x27;ll be purchasing the Panasonic portable.</li>
    <li> This was easy enough to use, just didn&#x27;t spray hard enough for me.</li>
    <li> I am a hygienist and just got braces recently. I use this to remove food debris after eating. It uses a high pressure stream of water. The reservoir could be larger but I don&#x27;t have any problems with it. I simply just refill it because I am at the sink cleaning my teeth anyways. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as an alternative to flossing.</li>
    <li> purchased this item just over a week ago.next weekend I donate it to Goodwill [sorry goodwill]. no power,its junk. buy the Panasonic,at least it works initially.</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 of these water piks...both have become unchargeable in less than a year.   The Panasonic cordless water pik is much better!</li>
    <li> Leaked all over the inside of the cabinet where I placed it for overnight.  Messed up the finish a little.&lt;br /&gt;I was too mad to even send the thing back.  Poor design !!</li>
    <li> This device is awful.  What I now realize is light use (2/3 of a reservoir used twice a day by one person) runs the battery down in 3 days, after 3 months of use.  Initially the charge would last about 5 or 6 days, but no more.  I hate this thing -- the recharge period is so long (16 hours) that I can&#x27;t use it every 6th or 8th time that my dentist recommends that I do so.  In addition, it is so much longer compared to other chargers that I use for my cellphone, blackberry, rechargeable batteries for flashlights and shower and other portable radios, that I have actually seen my electric bill increase.  DO NOT BUY THIS!  I have replaced it with a standard water pik that plugs into the wall.</li>
    <li> Broke the 3rd time I used it.  Just stopped in the middle of use, and didn&#x27;t take a charge.  Luckily, I received my money back from Amazon.  Very dissappointed.  Found it a little bulky and annoying to fill it twice to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Waterpik a few years ago and Waterpik has replaced it since 5 times because of battery problems.  The biggest problem with this device is that the battery doesn&#x27;t last more than a few months.  After about a month of use, the battery becomes so underpowered that it no longer rinses teeth effectively.  A few weeks after I notice the battery is no longer charging effectively, the battery fails completely.  I have to admit that Waterpik&#x27;s Consumer Service has always responded promptly to my complaints by sending me a replacement unit at no charge.  However, the replacement units last only a few months before they begin to die too and I have to begin the whole annoying process of asking for a replacement unit again.  Evidently, Waterpik has not solved the battery problem.  I would strongly advise against considering this product and dentists should cease recommending it.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have bought this product. Works fine for two months and then kaput.  Try another brand.  I like the Panasonic even thought it has batteries.  It does keep working unlike this item.</li>
    <li> Quick ship, quality product.</li>
    <li> This item looks good on the counter. It does not hold enough liquid. You have to hold it in an awkward position to completely empty it, meanwhile it&#x27;s dripping everywhere and making a mess. The switches are right under your fingers, unless of course you mean to turn it off every few seconds, you can move your hand to hold it, and really feel awkward while using it. I cannot and will not recommend this item to anyone.[[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS]]</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe what flossing leaves behind. My hygeinist can&#x27;t believe the difference since I&#x27;ve been using the waterpik &amp; my cleanings are now pain free.</li>
    <li> Flossing is one task I&#x27;ve never enjoyed.  Immediately upon using this, I noticed how much cleaner my teeth was.  This is basically like a high pressure washer on your teeth, but with the ability to get into those tight crevices as well.  Very easy to use.  Downside it the unit is quite big and bulky, and does not seem to hold much water.  I do like the cordless feature which makes it very convenient to use, no matter where I am.  The battery life is okay.  Because of this, I am now a big advocate of using a waterpik, and now practice better oral hygiene because I really do enjoy using my waterpik.</li>
    <li> Love this waterpik, was recommended by my Dentist, and could only find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I got this product the day I got braces. I have been using it religiously since then (about 2 months). I am hoping the bad reviews about how it brakes after a while aren&#x27;t true. So far I have had no problems with it. It cleans my teeth amazingly. I have no idea how I  lived with out it an can&#x27;t ever see myself going back to not using some type of waterpik. Since this my first waterpik I really can&#x27;t say if it is better/worse then others. One complaint is that the water supply could be larger. Other then that it&#x27;s great for the price, small, an cleans well.</li>
    <li> Gives a good, effective cleaning between teeth especially with the high-pressure tip.  Charge lasts for not less than two weeks or so.   After using for the first few times I flossed to find out what was left behind, and was impressed to find very little if anything but wax on my floss.  I&#x27;ve gotten good enough to do my whole mouth with one tankful, but I do it twice to be sure, plus i enjoy the gum massage. When I first started it took 4 tanks to do my whole mouth, so don&#x27;t give up.  I travel a lot so this compact rechargeable version suits me better than the large-tank version of the waterpik.</li>
    <li> this portable unit was never very powerful and after less than 1 year it failed to take or keep a charge, so I threw it out.  generally a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd battery operated water pik I have owned. I really enjoy it. I&#x27;m 76 years old and find I can maintain better comfort with my teeth using dental floss and a water pik. Depending upon what I eat determines how easy it is to clean out the particles lodged in between my teeth and gums. After using the water pik my teeth and mouth feel cleansed and fresh more so than just brushing. The advantage of the battery version of the water pik is its size. Its easier to move to a drawer and doesn&#x27;t need to add to the counter top clutter. It&#x27;s also easy to travel with. For me, the jet stream is more than adequate to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Kept putting off getting a water pik because of the size.  Hygenist recommended a portable and found it here.  Works fantastic and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> The item lost pressure shortly after using.  The pressure wasn&#x27;t that great to begin with.  Returned it with no problem.</li>
    <li> This is a bad product. I bought my first one four months ago after tree weeks the battery died. I replaced it, and the second device&#x27;s battery last only three months. I did follow the manufacture&#x27;s instructions to the word and did not over/under charge it. I would have gave this product minus five stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I had the &#x27;original&#x27; waterpik for 10 years.  This one leaked from the first use.  When you recharge it - make sure  there is no water in the tank or it will drip out of the charging hole.  The &#x27;flip top&#x27; on the water tank broke off in 4 months and the whole thing stopped working in 8 months.  I think that was due to water leaking into the motor.  Would NEVER buy again!</li>
    <li> Great, I went on an extended European trip and the cordless waterpik was perfect for cleaning between teeth and keeping the gums stimulated. I highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this device. It is helping tremendously with my oral care. But, after only a few days I dropped it and broke the attachment and base. I called the 800 # on the original packing about buying replacement parts. They sent me a new one right away - no charge! Now, THAT&#x27;s customer care. I highly recommend the product AND the customer care.</li>
    <li> This product is a great alternative to flossing and it leaves a just-from-the-dentist clean feeling in your mouth after every use.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> If you are addicted to using waterpicks this may be useful:&lt;br /&gt;On a long bike tour my travel waterpick lost its battery power to the point that it really did not work to clean my teeth, and I could not find a similar product in the countries I was travelling in.  So eventually I replaced the chargeable battery pack (which is basically two rechargeble AA batteries taped together) with two non-rechargeble AA batteries.  I have done this twice now.  It works like new for about 10 days, then the batteries die again.  Of course, I could no longer plug it in. But this solution worked long enough for me to get home to my stationary waterpick.&lt;br /&gt;So if you really HAVE to, pop the reservoir off with a flathead screw driver.  Use a philips screwdriver to remove the two screws in the base of the machine, use the flathead again to pry the guts out from the plastic case.  remove the battery-pack and create your own with two AAs, tape the appropriate wires to the appropriate battery contact points. And one important detail- on the battery pack there is a metal strip that connects the two contact points that are not connected to wires- save that metal strip and tape it to your home-made battery pack&#x27;s contact points which are opposite of the wires. Test if it turns on before you put it all back together again.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for over a year and wish I had gotten it sooner.  Works great for dental care. AAA+++</li>
    <li> So far, I have bought three of these and the life expectancy is about a year before they die. I liked the small model, but am going to have to find another model as they just don&#x27;t last and I feel are a waste of money at this point.</li>
    <li> My dentist and his dental hygienist have been after me for years to floss more regularly.  Sometimes I will go on a flossing binge but never for long.  Eight months ago my dentist scared the **** out of me by telling me that if my gums got any worse he&#x27;d send me to an oral surgeon.  The very next day I bought a Waterpik .... and have been using it ever since.  After four months I went back for a routine tooth cleaning and my dentist was thrilled.  My gums were healthy and there was so little plaque to remove I was in and out in half the usual time.  You can nitpik this product all you want, but there&#x27;s nothing like it. I use the portable version because I don&#x27;t have space in my bathroom for the table model.  I started with the low pressure jet but gradually got used to the high pressure nozzle and have been using it ever since.  This thing about cleaning each tooth for 4 seconds is nonsense as is the assertion that it only works in a vertical position.  Just fill it up and do all your teeth in the available time.  I work mostly on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After about 9 months the battery would no longer take a charge.  Bought another, bulkier portable model - same thing.  Am now on my third.  Still love the product but plan on periodic replacement.</li>
    <li> I have bought several cordless water piks (WP360W) and the battery always gives out. The last one almost made two years. Since they have a two year warranty, they replaced it free. However, the second one only lasted 7 months and they would not replace it again. I found customer service to be less than friendly. Maybe they are tired of all the complaints. I would think the company would try to improve their model. However, they keep making money because customers have to keep buying new ones. I will not buy another one and am looking at other brands.</li>
    <li> Seriously, does anyone build anything to last?  Failed 1 month after I bought it (I did not buy it from Amazon) and so I took it apart and repaired the crappy little pump inside it.  It actually lasted 2 months and failed to the point that I just threw it away!  I would happily pay more for something that would stay together!  I would say try another model, this one is of poor design and build!</li>
    <li> As a replacement for a traveling water pik, fifteen years old and still going strong, this jerry-built mechanism is a joke, a very bad joke. Panasonic must still be laughing.  Apparently, this opinion is shared by most of the other reviewers.  Yes, the reservoir is ridiculously small. The unit must be held upright to operate. The battery barely holds a charge sufficient for two consecutive uses and is declining in power. The power input is covered by rubber flap, which hardly secures it against the torrent of water that courses down your arm when in use. And given the size of the unit you might as well carry a regular Water Pik in a plastic bag when you travel.     Unfortunately, as usual, the joke is on the consumer!</li>
    <li> Today 1/6/10 I am buying another one of these and amazon was nice enough to let me know that I bought the previous one on February 29, 2008. So it lasted almost 2 years. My batteries never failed, something inside broke and water no longer comes out.    I have used this daily for the last two years. After about 3-4 uses I have to recharge it and I do notice that the water stream is less intense during the use before I charge it.    Reading the other reviews I wonder if I just got a good version of the product.  Here&#x27;s a couple suggestions for those of you who buy it.  1) Keep the little plastic plug that covers the recharging port closed so water does not get in it, and corrode it.  2) The top plastic tip rotates so you can easily get your back teeth.  3) I have noticed with most rechargeable items that if you leave them plugged in once they are charged it seems to damage the battery, ie it doesn&#x27;t hold the charge as long. I only leave my plugged in to charge for about an hour every couple days.  4) For a full cleaning you will need to refill the tank once. I use this before I floss to get rid of any large particles stuck in my teeth.   5) The on/off button and the plastic tip release are kind of close to one another at the top so just learn where they are so you don&#x27;t hit the wrong one and have water go all over the place.</li>
    <li> The waterpik idea is fantastic and has helped me bring my teeth and gums into perfect condition (along with flossing, stimudents, electric Oral B toothbrush, and Listerine). But, my first one of these died after a few months. I am now on the second and it is showing signs of trouble after about 5 months. There is some design flaw or cheap parts in these and I would not recommend anyone spending their money on it until they fix these.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, a little difficult to use, not cordless so worry about getting power source wet.  Reservoir is very dark and you cannot see how full it is.  Reservoir too small and has to be refilled 2-3 times to clean thoroughly.  Not very ergonomic.</li>
    <li> This particular model hasn&#x27;t the power.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.  Made in China huge turnoff.</li>
    <li> My WaterPik has served me well for almost a year. No charge problems at all. I followed the charging instructions.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these to replace my tank model that had literally worn out. I feel this model is subeffective and I have struggled with it for the very last time.  I feel it is a faulty product, not up to Waterpik&#x27;s innovations and reputation.  I read the other reviews that are negative and I agree with them all. I assumed it was not available anymore, but here it still is. This model does not do what a water irrigation system should do (the tank model of Waterpik).  This one is a big waste of money.  However, I do want to say that I feel using oral water jets is the best way to clean between teeth, remove tiny lodged particles, and best of all, strengthen the gums, which all add up to less $$ at the dentist. The original invention of personal dental water irrigation was genius.  It&#x27;s just this particular style that I feel is not up to Waterpik standards.  Spend a little more, get the bigger one with adequate tank and adjustable force.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who designed this appliance, but he needs to learn about usability studies before they turn him loose on another  product. The reservoir is too small, as others have pointed out. The on/off buttons are illogically located and designed, so  don&#x27;t be surprised if you spray your mirror or yourself when you click the two units together and your hand hits the power up button. Then, fumble for the off button which you can&#x27;t see or feel while holding the unit in your mouth. It doesn&#x27;t help that the words &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; wear away in a couple weeks. The two sections are difficult to pull apart. The flip top lid on the reservoir does not stay open when the two sections are attached, so it is impossible to let the reservoir&#x27;s interior air dry, creating the possibility of mold or bacterial buildup in the bottom of the reservoir. The blue section of the unit shows stains from hard water if not thoroughly dried off after each use. The tip broke off when it fell over due to poor design and I have no way to remove the broken-off end of the tip, so it&#x27;s useless now. Good riddance.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for 6 months, I used it every day. Then it started making a big noise and finally quit. Not worth the money for 6 months of use</li>
    <li> in spite of what you&#x27;ve read while working your way through these reviews, this item should last for many years, but not if you use it more than once every seven or eight months for no more than thirty seconds at a time.    sigh . . .    i am guilty of brand devotion.  that&#x27;s why i paid for a second one.  this kind of adoration was warranted many years ago when waterpik made excellent dental care products.  it is most assuredly not warranted now.      this thing, this portable, re-chargable waterpik, is garbage.  all the ugly things you&#x27;ve read about it are true.  (i have a sneaking suspicion that the 5 star reviews are the result of waterpik astro turfing.  if they are sincere reviews by people who actually got the few good portable waterpiks in existence, i hope these lucky individuals will accept my humble apology while giggling amongst themselves - through their sparkling-clean teeth - over my obvious envy.)  and apparently the waterpik people have so little respect for their customers that they ignore the complaints that have to bombard their email inboxes every day as long as we keep ordering this dreadful item.      my second cordless waterpik is struggling to get and maintain a charge as i type this.  it started with a robust, strong, healthy spray of water when i first got it.  i was elated.  hopeful.  now, barely two months later, the spray is becoming weaker and weaker.  it is doing exactly what my first one did, only sooner.  i shall not buy another.    i do have the standard plug-in \\&quot;desk-top model\\&quot; as i like to call it, but it has its own issues.  scathing review coming soon.    final word:  don&#x27;t buy it.  and if you&#x27;ve written a bad review of it here, go everywhere you can in cyberland and repeat the process.  spread the word, good people!  waterpik needs to be brought down for continuing to produce this sorry excuse for an oral irrigation system.</li>
    <li> This waterflosser is lightweight,easy to use and takes up minimal space on my vanity counter.   It stays charged throughout numerous uses.   The only drawback is that it is difficult to see the amount of water that is in the chamber.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and hold charge well  Good price and quality  Use every day small &amp; compact for travel</li>
    <li> The WP-360W is convenient, easy to use and quite effective. The WP has allowed my gums to heal from the effects of floss on sensitive areas. Don&#x27;t wait. Buy it NOW.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m away from home at least 3 days a week, so I thought this is great.  It was - for about 3 months.  Than it went dead.  Told it to a friend . . turns out she had exactly the same story.  It&#x27;s designed so it is verrrry difficult to open and change battery.  Also, who would design a rechargeable product without a LED to indicate charging / full ?  A piece of junk . . . stay away from it.</li>
    <li> I thought I could regulate the strength of water jet. We have very little counter space that is why I bought this compact one. IT is useful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had and used this device for 4 years. I use water with a good mouth wash and I can see the results going down the drain. My dentist who for years persisted in urging the use of floss and floss \\&quot;day and night\\&quot; etc., and that gum problems are arising from lack of floss, floss floss,no longer mentions flossing. I could not walk around with floss at my fingertips and had no intention of doing so. This item has traveled and been abused but continues to function.</li>
    <li> I wish that I would of spent the extra money and bought a waterpik that actually worked as advertised. Water stream too weak and does not hold enough water.</li>
    <li> This item does not work as described. It did not clean my teeth, the well has to be refilled several times for one cleaning and the water goes all over the sink and makes a mess. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This is a replacement Waterpik - the last one lasted about 1yr before the battery stopped charging.  It was so good, there was no question in replacing it.  I use it twice per day so I think a 1 year expectancy is great value for money.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk.  Holds only a small amount of water, must be held upright, has no cleaning power, and is highly inefficient. Should be pulled from the market pending a better, more useful design.[[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS]]</li>
    <li> just enough to get a little job done without getting my big one out.  Would buy again. Small and battery holds up.</li>
    <li> The center pin in the unit&#x27;s charging receptacle is both thin and susceptible to water.  This pin broke away from corrosion (stuck in the adapter plug) after just moderate use, rendering the unit useless.</li>
    <li> Very dissatisfied! This lasted 3 months before the battery has quit charging.</li>
    <li> Gives a good clean feeling after use, I am sure the continued use will have great results.</li>
    <li> This produce works great for a couple weeks. then the battery just died. I foolishly thought that maybe just that one was bad. So, I bought ANOTHER ONE! Wow, fool me TWICE! Same thing happened, only faster. Now I have wasted 90.00 and still need to find a decent waterflosser that actually works. Shame on you, waterpik, for such a lousy product!</li>
    <li> I disliked it so much I sent it back.  It was worthless. It was awkward to use and the reservoir didn&#x27;t hold enough water for one useage.  You have to refill it in the middle of cleaning your teeth. Spend more money and get a better product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this model to replace my original corded waterpik. Initially I was skeptical it could replace my 15 year old corded model. The first time I used it I felt it was under powered, the reservoir was small and it was not ergonomically designed. 1 month later I have adjusted to this waterpik and I love it. Its easy to refill, clean, has just the right amount of power and use. Its been running on a single charge since Christmas. Its worth the thirty bucks I paid for it. Go ahead give it a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this under recommendation of my dental hygenist - should have saved my money or should have gone for the more expensive model! This model doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to do a complete job - barely enough water to do half! Spending twice as much time on rinsing (this doesn&#x27;t clean, just rinses - you still need to brush)isn&#x27;t what I want to do before going to bed - I already spend enough time brushing, flossing and poking between my teeth - I don&#x27;t want to spend another five minutes just rinsing, refilling, rinsing, refilling, rinsing and then cleaning up afterwards (it&#x27;s a messy procedure) for this step in the process. Sorry, but I think Waterpik could have done better.</li>
    <li> After only one month of use, it wouldn&#x27;t charge any more. Worked great until then, for the price. But if it breaks so quick, it&#x27;s worthless. I&#x27;m pretty unhappy about this product.</li>
    <li> Actually if you look on the Waterpik web site you will find that the recharger is not dual voltage 120/240, and instructions warn against using a converter to try to charge it.  So this travel model will not work in half the world or more.</li>
    <li> Item is compact and takes up little space and that is what I needed. Do need to refill often but I find it works well.</li>
    <li> I like using the water pik as a flosser for cleaning my teeth.  My teeth do feel cleaner after using and brushing.  It is very easy to fill with water and to use.  However, it took a few tries to place flosser between teeth for proper cleaning.  It will be fully tested when I go in for my next dental appointment and learn how effective the water flosser has been.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for a road trip and it was just the right size.  The cordless feature made it easy to use on the trip and in the camper.</li>
    <li> I hesitated buying this because of the negative reviews.  The battery isn&#x27;t strong enough to pump the water very good.  After a month or so of use, it only holds a charge well enough to get a quarter of my mouth done.&lt;br /&gt;As far as portability, I can pack my full sized waterpick just as easily.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s past it&#x27;s warrenty so I guess I&#x27;m gonna chunk it.</li>
    <li> Battery seemingly passed on after 20 months.  I did however test the voltage output of the rated 3volt charger and found 2.7volts.  Putting a 5 volt charger on the unit brought it back to life in a few minutes and was able to run longer than it ever had. So now I wonder if the failures are due to not enough voltage on the charger vs the battery being bad.  I have a free extended warranty through my credit card, so will test the new unit power supply to see what the output voltage is on it.</li>
    <li> The pressure is not high enough for removing the residues between my teeth (is equivalent to 5~6/10 of pressures of the plug-in unit.)&lt;br /&gt;Battery (or motor?) died within an year.</li>
    <li> This product is convenient for home &amp; travel, well-made,for a reasonable price.  It is part of an excellent oral hygiene program, the bedrock of good health.  Joni Buschow, RN, CMSRN</li>
    <li> Everthing correct as dentist suggested</li>
    <li> I was having some gum issues, my dentist said that I should get a water pick.  So I did and it works great, love it.  I&#x27;m sure my dentist will be happy with the change in my gums too.</li>
    <li> Had an older design that battery gave out as noted by others.  This model has a much better electric recharge plug.  Been using a month now and all is working well</li>
    <li> Purchased at the recommendation of my dentist to help for healthier gums. Broke my first one (due to my own fault) and immediately purchased this again. Very happy with the settings, easy to use, no mess no fuss!</li>
    <li> i bought this unit because it is cordless and relatively small.  The most common complaint that I&#x27;ve seen from other reviewers is the amount of water it holds.  However, it appears that there also are battery and pump issues.  From the outset, I did not think the water pressure was high enough to do a good job.  Over two weeks&#x27; time, I noticed that the pressure seemed to decrease; therfore, the water took longer to deplete.  At about one month, the water would last for more than two minutes and the pressure was almost non-existent.  The Waterpick material urges consumers to call them before returning the unit to the store.  I read reviews and found out a strong consensus that this is simply a bad product that Waterpick should discontinue.  I returned mine to the store and purchased a larger, conventional plug-in model, and have been very happy with it.  The cost was more the portable unit but the results are well worth it.  After all, you wouldn&#x27;t buy a Waterpick unless you wanted to take good care of your gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this item but it turned out to be too much of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cordless&lt;br /&gt;-Compact&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with extra tip&lt;br /&gt;-Affordable&lt;br /&gt;-Easily gives those front and side teeth a good cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to fill&lt;br /&gt;-Battery &#x27;memory&#x27; is none existent after only 2 months of single person use.&lt;br /&gt;-Unit doesn&#x27;t appear to be waterproof (duh!) connections corrode and become unusable&lt;br /&gt;-Messy - can&#x27;t turn it to much to the side or water comes out so it can be difficult to get those back areas.&lt;br /&gt;-Difficult to get the back teeth with the same effectiveness as the front teeth&lt;br /&gt;-Needs to be filled more than once for a good thorough cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice would be to spend the extra money and get the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet.  It isn&#x27;t cordless or portable but it gets the job done well without all of the inconveniences of this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have braces and food always gets caught up in them and is very  hard to get out  unless you have a Water Pic. This item is great for traveling and not really bulkey and it stays charged for days.</li>
    <li> I dislike this product immensely.  I can&#x27;t do more than 1/4 of my mouth without refilling the resevoir and water goes everywhere when I use it.  I am used to a tip that revolves, so that is probably part of the problem.  I love the Waterpik Ultra and will stick with that, although it is too large to travel with.</li>
    <li> Poor design. Hard to put the water inside the machine. Broke down within a few weeks. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was going away for 5 weeks and did not want to take my big Waterpik with me.  As others have commented it does not hold too much water but I just refilled it.  It did what I wanted it to do and am very happy with it.  Very portable.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I have purchased. I really liked the first one but it unfortunately stopped working after only a few months. I do wish the water reservoir was bigger, as I have to stop to refill it halfway through using it.</li>
    <li> The reservoir is only about 3 oz.  So you end up having to refill it to finish cleaning.  The pressure seems a little weak compared to the Waterpik Ultra home unit.  Ok for trips but otherwise, I&#x27;d stick with the regular Waterpik Ultra for home use.</li>
    <li> The cordless rechargeable dental water jet is perfect to use in the shower....no more mirror splatter when cleaning your teeth.  I have recommended it to friends at work and they are stocking up for Christmas gifts.  It is affordable and works just as well as the high market priced items.</li>
    <li> Experienced everything that everyone else complains about- Short cycles between recharging, bulky and hard to handle, small reservoir. Coming off a plug-in counter top unit that gave me years of reliable service, very disappointing. At best an option to use when traveling, better than nothing when it works.</li>
    <li> I buy and use one of this, and I think is good. It is easy to use, you can wash your tooth under the shower, no problem with high voltage in bath. The minus point is for long time to charge. You need more then ten hours for recharge battery, time when you cannot use it. So, in that time your tooth can suffer. But generally I think it is good deserve money.</li>
    <li> After a while the unit loses its ability to retain an electrical charge. Unfortunately it is not designed to enable the user to replace the batteries. Until they can improve this aspect of the device it is not worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Do not waste money on this product.  Should have done more research.  Too strong for my gums and no pressure adjustment.  Stuck with a product I can&#x27;t exchange or use.</li>
    <li> A wall-powered (not a rechargeable battery) Waterpik does a very good job of flushing out food between my teeth. I purchased the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless in the hope that it would provide a similar capability in a package better suited for travel.  I did not expect it to have the same water tank capacity or power as the wall-powered unit. In praise of the unit, the  Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless delivers a stream of water at adequate pressure for a sufficient time to flush food from most all my teeth. However, I&#x27;m writing this review to prompt Waterpik to redesign the WP-360W as I really do need a portable waterflosser device.  My evaluation of the device, as designed, is that it is likely to fail after only a few weeks of regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit needs a battery charging indicator so one knows for certain that the battery is being charged.  In some hotel rooms, the power outlets do not make good connection, and one needs to wiggle the power brick to get a good connection. Without a power indicator, there is no way to tell if the unit is charging. A light to indicate when the unit is fully charged would be handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has not happened as yet, but then I&#x27;ve only been using the unit for a week, but I fully expect to the connection of the battery charger to the unit to quickly deteriorate.  If (perhaps when) water gets in around the two pins, there will be corrosion because a small voltage appears to be present across the pins at all times.  This small voltage is present even when the charger is not plugged into the unit.  As a minimum, the unit should be provided with a rubberize plug to keep the connector dry when the unit is in use.  A better approach would be a magnetically coupled charger like that used for the Braun electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My unit is only a week old, and already the motor sounds like it is struggling due to an inadequately charged battery.  Others have indicated the present battery is marginal at best.  ,,, addendum ... it is now about ten weeks later. UNIT HAS DIED.  Would not come one when turned on, then would come on by itself a few minutes later, eventually, totally dead.  The only positive is that Waterpic has promised to replace it free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water tank needs to be either made from clear plastic or have a clear stripe down the side, so one can tell when it is full. Without same, the only way to quickly fill it is to pour water into it until it overflows.  Of course, when it overflows, the connector area is likely to get wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of the unit combined with the low faucet height in most hotel sinks makes it difficult to fill the unit without spilling water. Again, when it overflows, the connector area is likely to get wet. The fill cap needs to be redesigned to allow quick filling from a low faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I will not be surprised that it no longer works when I go to take it on my next trip in a few weeks. ADDENDUM ... UNIT HAS SINCE DIED</li>
    <li> The waterpik is wonderful, great for travels, as gifts and very practical!  I will buy another one!</li>
    <li> THE WATERPIK WATERFLOSSER, ITS SPACE SAVING AND EASY TO USE, THIS IS  THE FRIST TIME I&#x27;VE USED THE CORDLESS TYPE I LIKE IT.  I ADMIT IT IS A LITTLE NOISY,</li>
    <li> I thought this was great for a few weeks. But the forcefulness, even with the stronger tip, diminishes within a day. Plus, the section the holds the water gets moldy pretty fast, since it&#x27;s not washable. I found I was filling it with vinegar in between uses to keep it fresh. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The reservoir is too small before it empties - 20 seconds?  It works well when it&#x27;s turned on, it&#x27;s just too short to thouroughly clean teeth.  If it would stay on streamning water for 40 seconds it would be much, much better.</li>
    <li> This waterpik does a good job and is my second one.  I always get good reviews from dentist during check-ups.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit a little over a year ago because I wanted a quick way to dislodge items prior to flossing and brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WP-360E2 that I have (bought in Europe) has a water reservoir that is too small. Luckily I could do with one filling but not spending 5 seconds on every tooth. At the beginning I had to watch out not to get that pulsating jet into my eye (would cause eye damage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is fantastic for us brace wearers, specially if you have a power chain installed on your braces so for it it was a Godsent while it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days ago I went to use it after a couple of days and it quickly discharged half way. I found that strange and put it to charge. Let it 8 hours and when I went to turn it on it did nothing. I put it to charge another 12 because unfortunately this unit also lacks a charge indicator (red/green) how can something so basic be missing from an expensive device?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after two consecutive charges I got the same result. The diagnostic is final, this unit, still relatively new and with not that many charge cycles on it, has become an expensive paper weight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, your investment in this unit is bad (BAD!) because as it turns out the battery compartment is sealed and the battery cannot be replaced. Something to look for when I buy another from another brand, no more Waterpik products for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary, while it works it serves its purpose with the pulsating water jet. Unfortunately it has a poor electrical design and very limited life span. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Lasted 1 month. I didn&#x27;t even bother to look for the waranty. I threw the box out so couldn&#x27;t return it to the store.  What a piece of crap. Used it 12 times before the batteries quit and no longer could recharge it. Thank God I paid only $12 for it (used a combination of coupons and it was on sale) so it cost me $1 each time I water-flossed my teeth. I feel sorry for those that paid the full price. Waterpik, pretty please, remove this junk from your prestigious collection of oral care products. I have used your great products since 1960&#x27;s, do not make me feel ashamed of you at this point of my life.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box the first thing I saw was a note that essentially said \\&quot;call us before you return this item to the retailer.\\&quot;  I thought to myself, this can&#x27;t be good.  Correct.  Dittos to all who said the reservoir is too small, the requirement that you have to keep it vertical is quite awkward, and it&#x27;s just plain messy.      I guess they&#x27;ve made a train  load of them and have to push them out the door.      Update: After 4 months it has totally died.  The motor can&#x27;t turn but a few seconds, even after a full charge.  The design allows water to get into the interior, which likely corroded the motor.</li>
    <li> I had the same problem as some of the other reviews. The battery life is very short. I went through 2 of these in less than 6 months. The second one actually started burning one day when plugged in. Luckly I was in the bathroom when it started smoking and then the plastic started melting around the battery compartment. I quicky unplugged and submerged in water to stop the burning. I would not advise anyone to leave this unattended while charging.</li>
    <li> I dont know why people are complaining this works great for me so far, I only charge the battry as needed , Works great in the shower , I like it I have been useing it for about three weeks now with no problems.</li>
    <li> This item is a total rip off. I bought a waterpik on the advice of my dentist - I already brush twice daily and floss several times a week. Had not owned a waterpik for many years, not since I had braces and owned one that had the tank reservoir that sits on the bathroom counter. Well this rechargeable model is very clumsy to use. The on/off are not easy to manage when it is spewing water. One \\&quot;tank\\&quot; is not enough to clean all your teeth for even a second each, let alone 5 secs per tooth. You will have to stop and refill it at least once, if not two times, to clean all your teeth. Definitely not worth the trouble and it will end up in a cupboard somewhere after I fumble with it a few more times in disbelief.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Worked good for the first few months, then it would no longer recharge. Still looks like new, however useless. Is this company making them to last for the warranty period only?</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without my Waterpik, particularly this model which takes up little space (unlike the ones with the big water trough). Its only shortcoming is that the life of the battery inside dies within about 2 years and is not replaceable. So be prepared to replace this in 18-24 months -- I&#x27;m on my third one. I use it in conjunction with brushing and flossing (don&#x27;t ever stop flossing!) and it has kept my teeth &amp; gums in great shape -- and I&#x27;m a baby boomer.</li>
    <li> Purchased the rechargable Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W three weeks ago for myself and one for my husband.  We absolutely love it and use it twice daily.   Enjoy being able to use mouthwash in it and love the pressure of the water on my teeth......simply a fantastic buy!   Don&#x27;t know how we lived without it!!!!</li>
    <li> For me the charge has been great, the pressure is excellent and I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking to add to their tooth maintenance practice!</li>
    <li> i purchased this item from meijers and it lasted exactly 10 months from the day that i purchased it using usually once a day. im glad i sent in warranty because i called them because it was under warranty for a year and all i had to do was give them my name and model number and they looked it up and said that since product was under warranty that i would get a brand new one and i got it in the mail in about 5 - 7 days and it didn&#x27;t cost me anything this one im using it twice a day because last time i went to dentist they did yearly check were they check space between gums and ones were my widom teeth are at were at a 5 and they said if it gets any worse i would probally need root canal and i defintitely dont want that so hopefully using this twice a day will prevent problem from getting worse. i also use philips sonic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I will get used to it, but probably should have gone for the classic model to replace mine (the only thing wrong with it was the hose sprung a leak)</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a new portable WaterPik since my travel-sized one died a few years ago. The cordless looks like a nice, streamlined machine, but it handles awkwardly, especially if you have arthritis. The water source doesn&#x27;t hold enough to do a thorough job and adds to the bulk of the device. I miss the mini-Water Pik.</li>
    <li> This item stopped working after I used it about 5 times.  Like flushing your money down the toilet.  And to add  insult to injury, I missed the cutoff for an Amazon refund.</li>
    <li> I received this from my orthodonist when I got braces.  It worked okay for awhile but then seemed to lose pressure and had to be kept plugged in between uses.  It is a nice size for traveling but I much prefer the full size model I purchased lor everyday use.</li>
    <li> It actually works; although I&#x27;d start with the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; pick as the regular one made my gums bleed.  It removes all particles in between the teeth and makes your mouth feel really clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another \\&quot;but\\&quot; I&#x27;d like to add, it would be great if the hole where the plug goes was on the bottom instead of right up in front where the water can&#x27;t help but spill over.</li>
    <li> I liked the performance of this waterpik.  However, the design is flawed.  It is heavy and awkward to hold.  The water tank doesn&#x27;t hold much.  And you&#x27;d think this would be designed for travel but the transformer won&#x27;t work on voltages other than US.</li>
    <li> Have to agree with the various reviews citing the unit&#x27;s poor battery performance after a few months of use. I&#x27;ve stepped up to a countertop WaterPik and like it much better. I&#x27;d still like one for travel, so I might try the Panasonic that takes regular batteries - it would be a lot easier to pack a set or two of rechargeables and know I&#x27;d have enough power when I need it.</li>
    <li> This product is a great dental care item.  As prescribed by my dentist, it has proven to do exactly what it was designed to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this WaterPik to replace one that died.  The old one was identical and lasted about 3 years.  The new one is a bit more powerful.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that the water tank is a little small. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other reviews have complained about the battery life, but I haven&#x27;t had any trouble.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing mine but I was in a hurry to get something since I just got braces on my teeth.  I bought the cordless version just for the fact that it would not take up a bunch of countertop space in my bathroom. It is very compact but that is the only positive.    The water tank does not hold enough water to clean your entire mouth, which makes perfect sense if you look at how small it is and consider how quickly the machine has to pump it out.  It is annoying to have to keep filling it up.  I feel the pressure is too hard.  Even with the \\&quot;gentle cleaning tip\\&quot; it still hurts to use it.  I don&#x27;t see any difference between the two tips.   Not to mention it is difficult to use without spraying water all over the place.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough yet to comment on the battery life but it looks like the future is not so bright.</li>
    <li> Considering a full waterpik set can cost about $100, this cordless one is a good deal.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but the resivoir is small.  I generally have to refill about 2 times for a complete job.  Also, I imagine this is true with all waterpik type devices, but the thing is messy!  I&#x27;ve only had it two weeks now, but I&#x27;ve not experienced any problems with it not holding its charge.  A fine buy for 20 bucks.</li>
    <li> This water flosser so to speak is tried and true.  Added to a good ultra sound type brushing,&lt;br /&gt;and you have a nice sense of invigoration and cleanliness for tooth and especially gum!&lt;br /&gt;Try adding a drop or two of PeriGum into the reservoir for the extra stimulation. It often removes&lt;br /&gt;a last bit of debris that may be hiding between a tooth or two even after a thorough brushing!</li>
    <li> My favorite teeth cleaning device</li>
    <li> Worked nicely for two &amp; a half months.  Then it quit. \\&quot;Warranty\\&quot; can be accessed only through website. No phone support. I filled out the web form and received a email asking for more information, but have not heard back in over a month.    Much Later:  I filled out the webform a second time and again got an email asking for more information.  I responded again and again got no response for several months. My son (with more geek cred than I) suggested that they might not be getting my email responses, so I sent a new response from my work email.  I got an immediate response and a new water pik that holds a charge well and still works.  It is a little leaky and not as powerful as the home model, but it will fit in a largish purse and provide relief if I get food stuck between my teeth while traveling.  I would upgrade my rating to a 3.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  The water chamber is way too small and I have to refill it twice before I am through cleaning my teeth.  I should have bought the full size waterpik, like I bought for my Mom.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one, go for the full size waterpik as it is a great dental hygiene tool.</li>
    <li> Just purchased the waterpik. Never got to use it.  Charged it the first time as instructed, filled the reservoir, inserted the tip and turned it on.  It blew the tip off each time.  E-mailed Waterpik, and explained the problem.  Their solution- take it back. I did...</li>
    <li> Pro:  Compact, does the job and inexpensive  Cons: reservoir must be refilled several times to complete the job.    Unless you have very limited counter space or wish to stick this in your suitcase, spend a few more bucks and get the Ultra.  On second thought- if you are that concerned with your dental care- spring for the bigger one and get a bigger suitcase.  Waterpik products do not seem to be as durable but they are still great as long as they do last</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of buying this WaterPik flosser twice.  The first time, it lasted about 6 months and then died.  The second time, it lasted about 7 months.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Buy a better quality unit.</li>
    <li> This product work well.  It took me some time to get used to it.  I was unable to get it too work in all the positions I wanted to use it.  thanks, MK</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to take to my deer lease for emergency use because we eat a lot of meat down there(sorry PETA). I snapped the reservoir onto the body of the unit and let it charge overnight. The next evening I filled the reservoir up put the high pressure tip in and pulled the trigger (sorry Brady bunch). I was amazed at how hard it was to grip the unit was and immediately sprayed it all over my trailer and up my nose. After regaining some composure I just stared at this little machine and was tempted to  chunk it into the woods.  I have owned it for about a week now and I still don&#x27;t like it and since it may be obsolete now I will probably take it back to Walmart ($33.00) and try to get my money back. All in all the pressure is barely adequate and the ergonomics are terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Later: I tried to remove the reservoir and it wont come off like the instructions say it will--now I am pissed!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Waterpik WB-360 in September 2009. At first, I enjoyed the convenience of the cordless device, not being tethered to a wall plug. The small water capacity and need to refill at times during use, which other reviewers have also mentioned, was a limitation but was tolerable. However, within about five months, a number of problems started to appear. The motor would stop working (no sound and no water) during use, or the water flow and the sound of the motor would become weak, or the motor would sound like it was on but no water would come out. At first, these problems were intermittent, and turning off and on several times would restore function, but finally it just stopped working altogether. I called Waterpik and they were very gracious. agreeing to send me a new unit based on trust, without even sending back the non-functioning unit. However, their customer support seemed clueless about the problem. They justified sending a new unit based on \\&quot;inability to hold a charge,\\&quot; which could not have been the cause since recharging it had little or no effect, and during the early stages it went off and back on at full power without recharging. The problems are more likely a physical blockage from debris getting into the water circulation, and/or an electrical short.    If only one unit had been bad and the replacement unit had worked fine, I would not be writing this review. But after a few months, the same exact problem occurred with the new one they had sent me as a replacement. I understand that there has been some minor modification in the product since this occurred, but the company has not given any public indication that this was to correct the type of problems described above. I therefore recommend that nobody purchase this product. However, I do think Waterpik is a good company in general and there is no comparable line of products that I am aware of, so I have purchased the Waterpik WP-100, a larger, plug-in unit, and have had no problems so far.</li>
    <li> This has to be the most poorly designed consumer device ever. You can&#x27;t fill it at a sink with normal faucets because it is too tall. The tank is too small for a thorough job with only one fill. The pik rotates out of alignment on its own with only gentle pressure. The pik release is too close to the on/off buttons and you end up releasing the pik by accident and water is everywhere. It is cumbersome and needs to be used two handed, one to hold it and the other to steer the pik. The old plug-in styles work much better.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I never used mine in the shower or mistreated it, but it died anyway, after just a few weeks of use, and now sits in a cupboard because it looks brand new and I couldn&#x27;t decide what to do with it.  For a portable unit, it is also far too big, and as someone with relatively small hands, I found it very awkward to hold onto.  By contrast, the battery-operated Panasonic [[ASIN:B0000A10MZ Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator]] is everything this is not--compact, easy to hold, and functional. I have 2 of those that have been working for years.  This Waterpik is clunky, poorly designed, badly engineered, too big, and, as others have noted, does not work.  We need the option to provide no stars, or minus stars, for products with completely negative characteristics.  If someone has the address of a Waterpik office I can send this disaster to, I&#x27;d be grateful.  Shame on them.</li>
    <li> Never worked right - didn&#x27;t have enough pressure and after a while it wouldn&#x27;t charge. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have used the cordless waterpik a long time and I love it.  The waterpik has really helped with my gums</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Waterpik daily for 6 months and I like it.  I&#x27;ve visited my dentist twice in this period and the hygienist gave me good mark for both my gum and teeth instead of the usual \\&quot;floss daily and brush after meal\\&quot; talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What work for me:&lt;br /&gt;- Swivel head makes it easy to clean inside the upper teeth.&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful water jet clean and clears out even the most sticky food.&lt;br /&gt;- The water reservoir size is just right for one use.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s very compact and portable.&lt;br /&gt;- Low price.  It&#x27;s about the same price as two sonicare heads.&lt;br /&gt;- Simple and quick to use.  (I know I shouldn&#x27;t but I floss less now and still have clean teeth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What need improvement:&lt;br /&gt;- The two buttons (on,off) takes time to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;- The battery holds good charge that last up to a week but I can feel it is decreasing lately.&lt;br /&gt;- Food sometime gets suck into the little air vents under the cap, causes clogging and reducing pump performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Waterpik does it job very well and, so far, have met all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve used this for 8 months now and I&#x27;m starting to have problem with the power button.  I&#x27;ve to press and hold it for 3 to 10 seconds to have it stay on.  The length of time that I have to press and hold is increasing.  I also have to charge it more often now (once every 1 to 2 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After 8 months, the on switches won&#x27;t latched anymore so I requested warranty replacement and was given a new one.  It was an easy process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I continued to use the original one for another month then it quit altogether.  It&#x27;s a good thing that it has a 2 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I got a replacement for free and used it for the next 2 years until the charging plug corroded out then I bought another one from Amazon again.  The new one has larger improved power plug that would prevent water trap that can cause corrosion.  I have also bought the other model WP-450and it works well but I still prefer this old model.</li>
    <li> i use to have this as my secondary oral irrigator ( i wear braces) but thank goodness for the panasonic ,  i dont have to suffer using waterpik anymore! this product sucks and a waste of money. the battery doesnt charge for some reason and the unit stops right in the middle of using it! try the panasonic brand coz its a much better alternative for this junk!</li>
    <li> It is compact but the water tank is not adequate and one has to hold the whole thing rather than the tip in order to go around the gums.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as an extra weapon in my arsenal against periodontal disease.    It definately seemed to improve my gum health (based on bleeding reduction) but like others have found it stopped charging up after about a month of use.    I properly conditioned the battery per the instructions, and it worked OK for about 5 charges, but on the 6th it did not turn on at all.    It also took an average of 2-3 fills per use, but this was not a big deal for me.    I&#x27;d avoid this and go for a plugged in version, which is what I replaced it with. Aside from the battery issue, its much easier to use the plugged in one as the handle is less bulky, and the mechnism to turn the nozzle to keep it aligned with your gums is better.</li>
    <li> My first water-pik lasted for a close to 3 years. I ordered second one in February, and noticed they changed the water-pik. I am wondering if this change was a problem.?? I had the second water-pik less then 4 months!  Will research other water-piks.</li>
    <li> Have the original (they don&#x27;t make it anymore) waterpik, always took the smaller version traveling, couldn&#x27;t live without it, but it, the smaller one, stopped working and have been trying to find it, to no avail...took a chance on this one......it&#x27;s lighter and smaller, a little more bulkier than the other, but works just fine, and easier to pack!</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t have the charging problems, I had the feeling that the unit got moldy between uses. There&#x27;s no way to dry the tiny container out overnight. Who wants to cleanse with nonpharmceutical-grade mold?</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best investments I have made&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the procedures that whiten teeth, but I am&lt;br /&gt;fussy about a clean mouth and clean teeth.  Much to my&lt;br /&gt;surprise after using the flosser a few times, I started&lt;br /&gt;getting compliments about my smile and my teeth are&lt;br /&gt;really clean and bright and oh my dentist is happy.&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with this Waterflosser.....get it and&lt;br /&gt;use it.</li>
    <li> the flaw to this product&#x27;s design is that if continually used you will replace it every 3-6 months(battery will no longer charge). Undoubtedly part of the company&#x27;s design to line their pockets with more money. They could haVE DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO MAKE IT LAST much LONGER. Go with the much better choice.[[ASIN:B000CEMWHI ShowerBreeze w/ 3&#x27; hose Oral Irrigator]]Unlimited water supply, no refilling. No DEAD batterries ever. And plenty of water pressure. NO CONTEST.</li>
    <li> I agree that the whole thing is a bit fiddly... small reservoir, as others say. But hey, you can fill it in a second, and what else your teeth this clean. So much nicer than flossing and much quicker... It&#x27;s like a power shower for your teeth!</li>
    <li> The design accomplishes two things:     1. It takes up less space and weight in a suitcase than other designs.     2. It is a poor choice for everyday use because there is no way to air-dry or to clean out the reservoir between uses. That, inevitably, makes it a nice breeding place for molds and other scuzzy things.</li>
    <li> This is a good value in the &gt;$30 range. It works well and my only complaint would be that the water reservoir is a little small for even a single use.</li>
    <li> This is the third one of these that I&#x27;ve gotten. In each case, the chamber that holds the water  softened and eventually sprung a leak. The only thing in it&#x27;s favor is that it&#x27;s better than the other  brand i got, which lasted for even less time. It would be nice if one were made with replaceable parts.</li>
    <li> This is a actually a good product while it lasted, it&#x27;s easy to handle and a very effective cleaning tool. However, the pump motor cut out after only 8 weeks and the return policy is a partial refund and I pay return shipping. So now I go to CVS for a new one and keep the receipt.</li>
    <li> very limited use out of this flosser before you can basically remove the cordless part out the title. battery life is horrible and cant wait till for another version.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and easy to keep clean. My teeth never felt cleaner in my life. Highly recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the WaterPik so got it.  I really, really love it.&lt;br /&gt;makes my mouth feel like I got my teeth cleaned.  Hope my next check up the dentist will be pleased I took his suggestion.</li>
    <li> I was excited for the first couple months by this product, however, I have gone through two of them and they stop holding a charge.  I have tried everything suggested and nothing works.  I have also tried the Panasonic oral irrigator and that too stopped working.  I wish I could find a similar product that works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Water Pik user for many, many years.  I (and my gums) can&#x27;t live without one.  The standard models are, indeed, clumsy counter space hogs.  This one is not.  You won&#x27;t have the tipping and spilling problems the bigger models provide.  My complaint is that this water pik simply doesn&#x27;t hold enough water.  I have to fill it four times to do my mouth... and my mouth isn&#x27;t that big.  This one&#x27;s going in my travel case and I&#x27;m in the market for a big sloshy one again.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this item but wish that the on-off switch was a little easier to use.  I tend to send water all over the sink and walls.</li>
    <li> use it daily, 2x. water in base is such a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;my 2nd one, used the other to death, after years. !</li>
    <li> I charged it up overnight and my first charge lasted two weeks! Awesome, I thought! Then I found out that was also my last charge. The darned thing would not hold a charge no matter ho many hours or days I leave it on the charger. It&#x27;s junk now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
    <li> This portable model gets the job done. it is not meant to replace your home model. It holds enough water to do half of your mouth real well, so fill it up twice...it&#x27;s easy. It is excellent for travel. it squirts hard enough.</li>
    <li> While marveling at the convenience I missed that the water flow isn&#x27;t adjustable like the standard model.  I need a low pressure waterpik. Guess I have to go back to the plug in model with a transformer for use overseas. Love the product, just not right for me.</li>
    <li> do not buy it anymore, I used only one month, the tube was blocked, and could not used it anymore.</li>
    <li> The pik head broke off within 3 weeks of the purchase -- with pieces of the pik inside the handle part. Couldn&#x27;t be fixed at all. A new pik couldn&#x27;t be put in.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Battery dies quickly.  The product design is so poor that it&#x27;s difficult to hold it while cleaning teeth and your fingers start to feel numb within minutes. The worst part - the product stopped working within 6 months.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews on this product and note the common thread.  For us, the lifespan for this unit was about 4 months.  After that, it would no longer hold a charge.  I cleaned the contacts and tried to re-initialize it with an additional 16 hour charge.  It continued to die within seconds.  Since I knew the unit was headed for the trash, I opened it up to see what was inside.  It was full of mold.  So an item that is designed to hold and dispense water isn&#x27;t even sealed well enough to protect from ordinary use.  The battery, of course, is soldered in and impossible to replace.  In short, this is a poorly designed piece of junk.  Do not buy this product!</li>
    <li> After a few months the metal plug for charging the battery, which inevitably gets wet, begins to corrode and you can&#x27;t charge it any more.</li>
    <li> Waterpik makes great products that last forever. Bought this model to travel with. It&#x27;s amazing how much better my mouth feels after using a Waterpik product; food particles that one things would be removed by thorough brushing, are \\&quot;discovered\\&quot; and removed by the Waterpik.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A \\&quot;must buy\\&quot; product - could save thousands of dollars on dental bills.</li>
    <li> I have used a counter standing Waterpik for a number of years and thought this would be a great thing having a smaller, more portable version.  What a waste of money.  If you do the recommended 5 secs per tooth, you can only do about 3 teeth before you have to shut it off and open it up and refill it again.  Can&#x27;t get the tip to stop twirling either.  Yuk.  Back to the countertop version...</li>
    <li> This cordless Water Pik is literally \\&quot;Just What The Doctor Ordered\\&quot;  After a certain dental procedure, this item was recommended by my oral surgeon.  It works wonderfully and I highly recommend it for it&#x27;s thorough cleaning and ease of use.</li>
    <li> works well, easy to handle, plenty of time to get the job done, I use it twice a day, what else can I say</li>
    <li> This is a great concept. I had a large set-up in my bathroom and got tired of all the work it took just to set it up. Needless to say - I stopped using it. It turned out to be a waste of money. This portable unit works well! Even though I still have moments when I shoot water at the mirror or somewhere on my face - I highly recommend this Waterflosser because now I floss with water every day. My dentist is thrilled, and so am I, with the results and improved gums!!</li>
    <li> Same complaints as everyone else.  The battery dies too early, and the position for the adapter gets wet, which leads to corrosion.  I bought THREE of these, thinking the problem must have been with my electrical outlet. I really wanted this product to last - as I loved the smaller size (no counter space!). I will not buy another one.  Lesson FINALLY learned.</li>
    <li> I got this because my 9-year-old daughter had a pallet expander installed by the orthodontist, and she was sounding like a cat coughing up a hairball every night at dinner because she was getting food stuck in her orthodontia.  It&#x27;s really nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want the full size waterpik because I read all the reviews about kids pulling on the hose and the whole thing crashing to the floor.  My kids would do that..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got the cheaper cordless model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... and it works great.  It has plenty of power to blast sticky rice and bits of chicken right out of the pallet expander and braces.  I can also hit the dog with  a concentrated stream of water from 25 feet away (bonus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice tool for the price.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get the newer model at twice the price.  This one was under $30 and works like a champ.</li>
    <li> One reason why I gave this waterpik only four out of five possible stars is that it has a short life time - a little less then a year.   Other then that, I love it. After brushing and flossing it cleans out the gumline. It works reliably, is handy and does not take much space on the counter. I don&#x27;t want to be without it anymore.  C.Z.</li>
    <li> Good as it gets the job done without too much recharging. &lt;br /&gt;It however needs more that one speed &amp; the attachments are all nearlly the same intensity. Should be more of a variation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rick</li>
    <li> It works great, I managed to make it work for me filling the tank only once through forcing the water pressure against my gum . The only con that I see is that it does not have any power indicator that tells you if it is fully charged.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have been happy using the ac powered WaterPiks so I tried this one when the last ac unit wore out.  Big mistake!  Within a few weeks the thing quit working.  I opened it up and found everything rusted, corroded and totally a mess.  Thinking it was a fluke I bought a second; should have known better.  It was worse than the first.  The engineering on this device is very bad, clearly built by the low bidder.  Definitely my last WaterPik!  &lt;br /&gt;C.G.B.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I have purchased.  I like mine so well, when my granddaughter (12) got braces I purchased one for her.  She says it is fantastic. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0002AHY6Q WaterPik WP-360W Hand-held Cordless Rechargeable Dental Water Jet]]</li>
    <li> Terrible. No power and battery is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;You could do a better job with a squirt gun.</li>
    <li> I like the waterpik a lot, it really cleans your teeth and gives a good massage to your gums.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flosser I have ever used! Easy to charge, easy to use, and great for travel! Does a great job and doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth!!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a water pik so I did not know what to expect.  I find that this is very easy to handle and use and very effective. It is quite compact and takes up little room either for storage or standing out on the vanity.  All in all I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> We were going on vacation for 2 weeks and I didn&#x27;t want to have to pack my regular sized Waterpik.  This rechargeable one was perfect for traveling.  It feels great in your hand.  Takes up very little room in your suitcase and one full charge lasts for about 3 weeks.  It has two piks that do as good a job as my full sized Waterpik.  Holds just enough water.</li>
    <li> worked great for a week, then started getting less and less powerful.  basically usless now. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bought the WaterPik WP-360W in Jan. &#x27;07 at my local Walgreens. I had been planning for some time to purchase a oral irrigator because I wanted to improve my oral health. I looked at different types and I decided on this one because it was portable and rechargable, which I thought was a great idea. The first 3 months it worked well, but by April I noticed I would have to charge it for longer and longer periods of time. Even after doing that I would have to recharge after only using it 2 days. So fast-forward to June, I turned it on and it ran for 2 seconds and then nothing. I thought maybe if I charged it for 2 days that this might help, so I tried turning it on and it completely ceased to work.    The only reason why it&#x27;s getting a 1 star rating is that in the period time it did work, the condition of my gums improved and so did my dental check-ups.    My recommendation to WaterPik is to make this product so that you can replace the rechargeable battery yourself, instead of going through the hassle of contacting their Customer Service to replace this with another WaterPik WP-360W.</li>
    <li> Very handy for travel.  I like it so far.  Of course, it can&#x27;t be compared with the one at home.  It&#x27;s a good choice to take care of the teeth while on the road.</li>
    <li> Mine worked fine for about a month and after that it would not hold a charge. Not worth the price.  It doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star but that is the lowest rating amazon allows.</li>
    <li> I have gone through 2 of these now.  It works well for awhile, but then it will not hold a charge because the connection for the recharging cord gets corroded.  I will say that WaterPik did stand behind the product by replacing the first one, but because of this product&#x27;s design flaw, I will not get another.</li>
    <li> The product does what it&#x27;s claimed. It cleans my teeth..... and I can take it wherever I go.  The batteries will  hold a charge for about a week if used once daily.</li>
    <li> i bought the water pik for me and the panasonic for my parents. my portable water pik worked well and lasted about 2 months and then refused to charge up. the company replaced it for a $3.00 fee...quick turnaround.  the new one lasted less than a month. i am disgusted. the panasonic is still running well and i have since purchased one for myself. shame on water pik for stealing my money!</li>
    <li> I have had four of these Waterpiks now and I love them.  They last about a week between charges and are good for about a year and then need replacing.   They do a great job and don&#x27;t take up much space on the counter.</li>
    <li> This is our first waterpik love the fact it is a recharble and it does hold a charge for quite a while this is being used by a 9 year old boy with spacer soon to have a retainer.&lt;br /&gt; we have no Electric outlet for any appliance in the bathroom so he can use this with out any problems.&lt;br /&gt;I was concern might be too big for a child it seems just fine for our needs would I recomend this to a friend defintly yes</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing.  I read some reviews before I purchased and some had negetive remarks but not me.  I plugged it in and charged it for the full 16 hours reccomended before first use and I haven&#x27;t recharged it yet.  It took about three uses to get the hang of how to use and turn it. It is quite messy but if your leaning over a sink that&#x27;s the whole point.  It&#x27;s amazing at how much is between teeth yuck  but it definetely does the job.  I have only used the low pressure tip and that&#x27;s plenty for my needs. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> This was my first waterpik. The first one I picked up was clearly used. I ended up taking that back to the store and got a new one...but I also wondered...why was this brought back? Hmmm?    For the second go-round, the irrigator&#x27;s tip kept on moving during usage and never stayed still, causing water to splash everywhere..at one point, my entire shirt got soaked and I felt like I had taken a bath.   I tried using it for a few days, and had the same difficulties.    The reservoir constantly requires refilling.    I gave up and ended up going back and getting a Waterpik Ultra. I had better luck with the stationary, home model.    Not sure if there&#x27;s a good portable out there as of this writing...  *shrug*</li>
    <li> This is really a nice product. It works great. It is not as effective as the traditional floss but much easier to use.</li>
    <li> While it worked, which wasn&#x27;t for very long it did a good job of removing most, though not all debrie.  I would floss after using the water-flosser and would still find a very small amount of food particles. However it  did impart a  feeling of &#x27;clean&#x27; and I liked using it.    THE REALLY BAD: It stopped recharging in less than a year. The company replaced it with another which also stopped recharging in less than a year! The overall design is not as functional as it should be. It is difficult to take apart for cleaning or to change the tip.     Bottom line:  I miss using it but expensive, considering its short lived life.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;new improved&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t half as good as the former design. Very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for one that lasted 10+ years.  This one sounds like a threshing machine, is not as powerful, difficult to seat, therefore leaks.    What happened to Waterpik?  Made in China now?  Wish I knew what to replace it with.</li>
    <li> I bought this just prior to getting braces. I am in my 30&#x27;s so I know what I need to do to keep my braces clean and was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t bulky but would work well. After promptly breaking the high power tip because I didn&#x27;t read directions I figured out how to use it properly with the low power.   It fishes all the gunk out and helps my mouth feel cleaner as well as clean out the braces so that they continue to dig into my cheeks and tongue. I have now broken the low power tip and just ordered replacements (cheaper on Amazon even with shipping than at the waterpik store) and I miss using it already.   Yes I have to refill it, but it&#x27;s portable - isn&#x27;t the point of being cordless/portable making it small enough to carry around? I took it on vacation and it lasted all week with no recharge. I (knock on wood) have not had any issue with the battery and no, I don&#x27;t drain it all the way first.</li>
    <li> The product is made well and works well.  It&#x27;s just that I have to train myself to use it.  I have never had a waterflosser  before and I am constantly spraying water all over the mirror. I have to shut it off before I remove it from my mouth.  Duh!</li>
    <li> I see I&#x27;m not alone here, but I wanted to add my experience so potential victims can see another one-star review.  Actually I&#x27;d like to give this product no stars but the system doesn&#x27;t allow for that.  The thing worked okay for a couple of weeks although I never was able to do my whole mouth without having to refill the tiny reservoir.  After that it started to labor, then stop until you shake it or tap it back to life.  That went on for a week.  Then one day it just died out, pulsing maybe once every 4 or 5 seconds.  It sounded like it was out of power so I plugged it in and charged it again but to no avail.  I did get it to work once more for about 10 seconds by tapping it firmly against my hand, and that was the last of it.  If you do want to buy this thing, buy it locally so you can return it for a refund easilly.    UPDATE 11/12/08:  Yeah, I tried it again, still no good.  The problem definitely insn&#x27;t a battery issue.  When there&#x27;s no water in the reservoir it runs just fine, full speed ahead and no signs of slowing after two minutes, but the second you put water in the thing, it goes back to limping along at about a pulse a second.  Let the water out and it&#x27;s back up to full speed ahead.  Sounds like a bad motor or pump to me.  Hey what&#x27;s the difference it&#x27;s still junk.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I wish I had read these reviews prior to purchasing. As others have mentioned, in order to adequately clean your mouth, the reservoir must be filled up repeatedly (at least 4 times), the angle the unit has to be held is awkward and not well thought out, the unit has very little power (I&#x27;ve not even used the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; tip) even when fully charged.  I can see where this would be helpful when traveling, for every day home use, it falls short.  Thankfully, the unit was inexpensive, but it will be going into my closet until the next time I travel and I&#x27;ll go back to the reliable (and powerful) countertop model.</li>
    <li> If you buy this you will be sorry and Amazon won&#x27;t help you when it the battery stops charging.  Amazon should be ashamed that they keep selling a product that is known to be this defective.  Mine stopped holding a charge after 90 days</li>
    <li> This item is a perfect addition to oral health. Especially safe and effective great to take anywhere easy to use.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0002AHY6Q Waterpik WP-360W Hand-held Cordless Rechargeable Dental Water Jet]]Yep, the battery is the weakness of this unit.  Litheon Ion would have been a far superior technology.  For Pete&#x27;s sake, this unit is billed as a portable unit.  Don&#x27;t expect a massive reservoir!  So what if you have to fill it 2 or more times.  Two fillings do the job well and I have 2 bridges.  Floss first to loosen particles.  Spending to much time in one area could damage gum tissues.  I have used this unit for over a year now, along with daily brushing and flossing, and my hygenist is very impressed.  I believe it&#x27;s worth the $25 to try it and see if you like it.  Your teeth are worth it!</li>
    <li> Last week I purchased my fourth, count &#x27;em fourth, Waterpik WP-360 in the past 3-1/2 years or so. I bought my first when I had adult braces, which were removed about 1-1/2 years ago. While the unit works well (they clean and remove food particles superbly), they don&#x27;t work for long.  The first two died after they would no longer take a charge. The third would keep its charge longer, but the on-off switch broke about two weeks ago. So call me a sucker, but I bought a fourth. If this one dies, I will try to find something better. I will also be back to the Waterpik Facebook page and post additional disappointment. One other thing: I called Waterpik customer service to describe the problems and ask if I should be doing something differently to extend the life of the product. The rep said (1) keep it plugged in and charging while it&#x27;s not in use (which I did with the first two, and they died), and (2) remove the cleaning head when it&#x27;s not in use, which I always do. He offered no apologies, no coupons, no help whatsoever ... nada.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these i have gotten. first one broke when dropping. this one however doesnt seem as good as the first for some reason (before it broke)</li>
    <li> I was skeptic at first. Now I am not. I like this thing and it makes me floss more often. I WOULD recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like the product. Sometimes it needs 2 fillings, but I got used to it. Initial charge lasted for about 3 weeks. No complaints as of now.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product, I can recommended, works great an is very confortable to handle good prrchase</li>
    <li> They both stopped working.  One worked for about 3 months and the other 1 month.  Not worth it.  I have spent a lot of money for nothing.  I shouldn&#x27;t have given it a second chance.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace another one that lasted one and half years. This one lasted only 4 months. A little more diligent tooth brushing, flossing, and mouth rinsing is more beneficial than this product.</li>
    <li> Like the product very much.  I feel that it cleans between the teeth better than regular floss.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great design (portable, rechargeable, etc..) however after owning two of them I could not recommend them to anyone, the last one only lasted a month using it once a day.  The first few times you use it there is plenty of power after that you might as well use a garden hose, it would work better.  Buy something different such as an oral breeze and don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.</li>
    <li> Pressure spray is higher than advertised, the high pressure nozzle actually hurt. I put a hot glue plug in the high pressure and then drilled a 3/64\\&quot; hole thru it to lower the pressure, now OK.</li>
    <li> Seeing that their are only two companies making small waterpiks  that can be easily transported in a carryon, this company has a  near monopoly on this garbage product. You will get at best 1-3   years until you have to buy a new one. Waterpik is smart enough   in their construction to rip off the consumer. They make it so you  can&#x27;t replace the battery, and they do not make a small Waterpik  that is electric. If they did guess what... planned obsolescence   would not help their gross margins like this complete tool does  based on the highest profit margin possible for throwaway consumer   items.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t know for sure until I see the dentist for my next checkup how well its been working - but I like this gizmo.  Easy to handle, holds a lot of water, keeps a charge.      My only problem is a lack of outlets in the bathroom - I have to keep the charger in another room.</li>
    <li> Could be stronger jet, this replaced a previous model which died and could not be repaired but was significantly more powerful.</li>
    <li> I just got one and was excited that it&#x27;s cordless, but it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water and it&#x27;s a hassle to fill through the small tall container on the side. I&#x27;m going back to the plug in one that has the very large water container and smaller unit to hold in your mouth also</li>
    <li> For me this was exactly what I was looking for. Dentist says I need to use a waterpik, and I hated having the bulky unit with the water well on my countertop. This is a little bigger than my rechargable toothbrush. Definitely enough power, and enough water to do the job. I can do my entire mouth on one fill-up of water. I have had it for over two weeks now, and only recharged once.</li>
    <li> I had one similar before and had been looking to purchase a new one, and Amazon had it and the price was right, so needless to say I was very pleased, and as usual it arrived in great time!</li>
    <li> My experience with this unit is identical to one of the earlier reviewers. The unit was fine for some time, than water somehow damaged the battery although I made sure to keep it dry and clean and the socket for the charger tightly sealed. After going through two of these units in less than six months it would really be dumb to trust this product for the third time.</li>
    <li> i have bought this at a different store, but it is the same thing. it is a pain in the ass to clean. i have nasty brown residue on the bottom and i cant clean it. ive tried vinegar and baking soda and it didnt work. also, it dies very quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for three months now and it still works like a gem. It flosses very well and it does what it promises in regards to strengthening your gums. May sting for those unused to flossing prior to using this product or if you have unhealthy gums. However, they thoughtfully include two tips--the soft pressure and hard pressure tips--for those who need to work their gums back to health steadily.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at the quality. I&#x27;ve been pricing the waterpik i was not sure this would suit me due to the low price. It&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the counter top. I do believe it came the following day that I ordered it. I don&#x27;t know how that happened but that was an added bonus. It&#x27;s just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read all these reviews before purchasing this Waterpik -- I never would have done it. You can add my complaints of a faulty battery to the mix. I love the concept and the operation of the flosser, it&#x27;s just a pity it is so badly constructed that quick breakdown is inevitable, not an exception. Mine worked for about a month before the battery started running out of its charge; and another month when it stopped recharging altogether. I&#x27;m surprised there wasn&#x27;t a recall, but at $20 I guess no one thought it worth the effort. Still, I&#x27;m glad I saw these reviews. I might have gotten a second one on the hope that the first lemon was just a fluke. It&#x27;s not. AVOID.</li>
    <li> I liked this product while it lasted, and I could really feel the difference in the health of my gums.     It&#x27;s bulky and unwieldy, but I got used to it. Didn&#x27;t hold enough water to do my whole mouth, so had to refill several times - annoying.    But then it just stopped pumping. The battery is still good, it just makes this slow grinding churning sound and no water comes out.    Unfortunately didn&#x27;t keep my receipt.    I plan on getting the counter model instead, keeping my receipt, and filling out the warranty card.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this product. I have had it for a little under a month and it no longer keeps a charge. Even when trying to use the product while it is still plugged up does not work. Before this it worked fine and the battery life was actually pretty long I only needed to charge it a  couple of days. I have wasted $20 bucks on this things because it no longer works.</li>
    <li> I wanted to write this review, because after purchase I read all of these negative reviews and felt so discouraged after picking it up at target for $30. I felt like an idiot before I&#x27;d even opened the box. Then I said, \\&quot;Screw the reviews\\&quot;, I want to try it. So here&#x27;s my surprising reaction.    This Waterflosser is AMAZING! Granted, I&#x27;ve never owned such a thing, so what can you really compare it to but the dentist&#x27;s office? I read the directions and ignored the charging recommendations (Really, who wants to charge something for an entire day before using it? What fun is that?) It already had a decent amount of charge in it. I plugged it in for ten minutes and took it for spin.    After some trial and error, and hysterical laughter from spraying myself in the face trying to point it at my mouth from afar, I got the hang of it, and I had never felt such a flossing in my life. It was glorious, my mouth felt so clean and healthy!    Now I use it every day at least once, and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it. I haven&#x27;t used string floss since. It&#x27;s quite liberating. It&#x27;s also nice not to have bleeding gums.    My smile is even noticeably whiter, and some stains have faded  (combined with the recent use of an electric toothbrush). I would recommend this to anyone who hates flossing. Yes, it&#x27;s probably not the most ergonomic design, but I don&#x27;t understand how you would hold this thing any other way. What are people doing, water flossing upside down? Hold it up straight at an angle? What&#x27;s so hard or difficult about that? I&#x27;m beginning to think we&#x27;ve become this culture of obligatory unsatisfaction, even with the most useful things, such as Waterpik&#x27;s Cordless Waterflosser!    It would be nice if they had a charging light on it, but I used it for two weeks before even charging it a second time. It&#x27;s also nice to add an ounce of mouthwash for a bit of refresh. Just don&#x27;t fill it to the brim with the stuff, listerine&#x27;s a bit too intense at 20 feet per second.    Keep in mind, if you don&#x27;t like this device, you can always use it to squirt your kids or naughty animals in the living room. Honestly, you can shoot about 30 feet with this thing. It&#x27;s great!    Worth it for the price. Hope it doesn&#x27;t die like the rest of yours! I suggest you just don&#x27;t overcharge it.</li>
    <li> This product failed in less than one year. It appears to be the rechargeable battery and is clearly a design or quality defect. It should be removed from the market.</li>
    <li> My dentist reccommended I use one due to my bone loss and receding gums and I am real&lt;br /&gt;Impressed so far. I have to refill tank but I love th size due to cramped spaces. I hope I have a better checkup when I go back. They suggested I put a small amount of listerine in tank</li>
    <li> This product is a piece of crap bought in May, and now has stopped working.  DO NOT BUY THIS unless you like throwing money away.</li>
    <li> this machine worked really well....  it was compact, and did the job.  However, just like the other reviewers, I found that no matter how careful you are in your handling of this waterpik, it eventually refuses to charge.  I owned 2, and each one started to lose the ability to re-charge within weeks.  They seemed to last about 1-2 months before they die. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I replaced this model with the larger waterpik professional, and have been happy ever since.....</li>
    <li> This product does work as advertised: it does squirt water in little pulses.  Almost nothing else, though, is good about this device.  It holds so little water in the reservoir (about 30 seconds worth) that in order to clean each tooth the specified five seconds, you have to refill it FOUR times.  What were the designers thinking?  Do they really expect users to turn it off, open the lid, pour water inside, start it up, and continue four times??  I called customer service and the service person admitted, \\&quot;Yes, you may have to fill it multiple times.\\&quot;  I could tell by her tone of voice that she had heard the complaint many times before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have not had my unit long enough to say whether the battery lasts a long time--I know I won&#x27;t have it long enough to find out.</li>
    <li> well first off, the water you put in, is cold, so it is a wake up when you use it and if you have any senstive teeth, beware. Other then that, I could say it does work, just wish the force was not as hard as it is, but maybe that is what it is for, to loosen food and stuff that gets trapped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 4 or 5 of these and have never had one last more than 5 months. Main problem is that the battery fails to hold a charge.  I had one that didn&#x27;t last 3 weeks.  Wish someone else would make one that is reliable.</li>
    <li> The Waterflosser is just satisfactory.    It would be an improvement if the water came out at a higher pressure. Also, the water capacity could be a bit fuller. I find I have to re-fill the container 2 or 3 times to get a satisfyi8ng treatment.    I have not had to recharge as yet, which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Though one of WaterPik&#x27;s least expensive models, my wife and I find the WP-360W to be more effective and reliable than all WaterPik&#x27;s priciest models (which disappointed us). Biggest problem: replacement styluses are hard to find and excessively expensive. Also, the dark blue stylus is inferior to the clear one. Usage tip: don&#x27;t keep the unit charging all the time because that will burn out the charger, ruin the battery or both (in any case it will make the unit stop working permanently).</li>
    <li> I like it. It works very good. But if this product can work on both 110V AND 220V, I would like and recommend it much more.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Had one before the same, and it was wonderful but had to be sent back after one year use due to base becoming \\&quot;unchargable\\&quot;. Company is dragging feet on replacement even though it&#x27;s still under warrenty! But, I decided to try same brand because it&#x27;s excellent when working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blu</li>
    <li> Not much power for good hydration. Messy, have to postion the unit just right to make the water flow. The stationary models which have the water resevoir on the base and not in your hand work much better. Don&#x27;t recommend buying this, it&#x27;s disappointing and I returned it.</li>
    <li> This item does not even deserve the one star I had to give it! I bought this product from a store in town, nice while it lasted. I thought it sounded like a weak motor from the start...I was right, it only lasted slightly more than two months! Ridiculous!...just glad it quit soon enough to return to Linens and Things. So much for a name brand...Shame on WaterPik!</li>
    <li> Ineffective. Not worth the money. Does not hold enough water and the pressure out of the nozzle is too low to do the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased mine over 4 years ago to replace one (another mode)l that I bought and then left the charger for it in Vegas. I use mine daily (sometimes twice a day) and have had no problem. I run mine all the way down (it takes a couple of weeks or more to run down) before recharging again. I&#x27;m particularly fond of this one because it is narrow enough to keep on the countertop without being an eyesore and it is small enough to fit in my travel bag without taking up too much space. I&#x27;m almost glad that I forgot my charger for the other one or else I would have never had to look for a replacement and found this. I think another trick to this one is to make sure the water is drained after each use and a thorough cleaning every couple of months is a must, not only for better maintenance but also for better hygiene (if it isn&#x27;t occasionally cleaned there is a build up of nasty stuff at the bottom where the water canister and pump connect).</li>
    <li> I love my cordless rechargeable WP-360W. I went out of town and left the charger behind. If someone has this same unit could you just let me know what the voltage is so I can get the right one. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s big and clunky and the buttons are hard to use and the nozzle spins and I can&#x27;t figure out how to tighten it. It does the job, I have braces. It does not hold a charge for long and then the water flow gets weak. How would I redesign it? Not sure, but you would think in this day and age that they could have come up with something better. But it does the job.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended to buy a waterpik.  This item was hard to use.  It stopped working completely in two months.  Is there any way I can get my money back.  Or can they provide another model for trial?</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t rate this product as low as I could because it is a useless watepik.  To properly use this item it has to be turned sideways and upon doing so you lose water pressure and nothing comes out.  I purchased a ultra water flosser waterpik from your company with a separate holding tank and this one works perfectly. Thanks for you effort in taking care of my problem with my first order.  Joe Norton</li>
    <li> This device doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to do the entire mouth and awkward  to hold.  I tossed it within the week</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit from my denitst... Actually purchased three...  They do not hold up to long term use... After 6 weeks I am looking for something similar but designed for durability....</li>
    <li> We love our new Waterpik Waterflosser.  It&#x27;s amazing that even after a regular floss and brush, the Waterpik Waterflosser will still expel food particles from the gums and in between teeth.  After having undergone deep root cleaning for periodontal disease and having regular 3-month follow up cleanings since, I&#x27;m anxious to hear what my dental hygienist has to say come July, since I started using this product after my most recent visit.  I bought two and am giving one[[ASIN:B0002AHY6Q Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W]] to a family member.</li>
    <li> the pulse is too weak and its sloppy to use as it drips volumes of water.  tank could be larger as well</li>
    <li> Great waterpik for the price. I like everything about it! This was actually one on a list I received from the dentist, and although it was not the most expensive I decided I would try it! Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is very acceptable for its cost and does an excellent job of dislodging particles while stimulating the gums. Most users should employ the low pressure nozzle and exhaust two fills of water per use.    The product is a good buy for dental care.</li>
    <li> Its as weak as a sissy!!!!!!!!!!  runs fast but when you get water in, well then I can gargle better then this water cotton pick&#x27;n waterpik. but it is cool look&#x27;n and it does have gold plated power connection</li>
    <li> Hate flossing, but love my Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for a kid with braces.</li>
    <li> I was very  disappointed with the Water Flosser. The water lid does not close securely,-and this model  does not have a charging light.   I called the company and I was informed that it was defaulted and I  could send it back.  I guess you get what you pay got.</li>
    <li> I already had a personal dental waterjet but found that it took up too much space on my bathroom countertop. I bought the WP360W to see if a unit that was that low priced would work as well as the countertop model. To my surprise, it works very well and is easy to use. When this ones dies, I&#x27;ll definitely get another.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 9 yr old who has braces.  It worked fine.  Our problem was that she dropped it and the the tip broke off.  That was not too big of a problem--we still had the second tip.  But then she dropped it again. Now our problem is that we can&#x27;t get replacement tips.    The Waterpik site says that they are out of stock.  So we have a waterpik that works (battery-wise) but no tips.    I will take everyone&#x27;s advice and not buy another one.    Before you chuck your waterpik for the battery issues--consider sending me the tips :)</li>
    <li> I bought this Waterpick In January 2008 it lasted until March 2008. I took it to a repair shop the repairman open it up it was all full of rust. The motor, battery where all shot. Don&#x27;t buy this artical. You will be sorry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just OK.  Not enough of a tank to be really good.  Need to fill it twice.[[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Ultra Cordless Dental Water Jet]]</li>
    <li> I like this model much much more than the newer version developed by Waterpik. That newer model is of poorer design and has several other flaws: recharging is less efficient, parts fall off, and it seems made more cheaply.</li>
    <li> I bought this Waterpik instead of the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; kind because I thought it would be better and save some space in the bathroom.  I took it back to the store after about 1 week.  The tips pop off unexpectedly and water leaks from the base of the tip, as well as from the water chamber.  The water chamber doesn&#x27;t hold enough water, so you have to refill it 2 or 3 times in order to get a thorough cleaning.  It is difficult to control the angle of the tips, because they swivel on the base while in your mouth.  All together, this is a poorly designed product.  I exchanged it for the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; waterpik which is WAY superior.</li>
    <li> As a dental Hygienist I highly recommend this product and have seen some amazing reductions in patient&#x27;s bleeding gums (bleeding&#x3D;disease/infection). It is great for people with periodontal disease and gingivitis (over 90% of us have some-even professionals), as well as people who have large hands and people who have braces. I have even sold the product out of several offices because I love it so much. Here are some things to note.    1) It will take a little bit to get used to. I warn my patient&#x27;s that they may get water in their eyes the first few times. The resevoir is smaller and will need to be refilled.    2) It is very convenient. When you see this in your shower you are more likely to use it daily and make it a habit. You may have to recharge it every week or so when it runs down. Also, before you use it the first time fully charge it overnight.    3) You should keep the unit away from the running water when not in use. I have had two units and never had one corrode. You need to make sure the flap where you charge it is closed fully. Just use common sense...turn the charging portal away from the water when you refill, etc. I refill right in my shower.    4) The first one I had lasted a year and a half. These things do not last forever, but for the price they are so worth it. Most people pay more for coffee a month. Is your health worth that? Also Waterpik invented the machines and are very good about replacing any defective item. Every once in awhile you get a dud battery, I don&#x27;t care what kind of product it is. Call them and they will replace it.          For all of you who don&#x27;t know it.....we have a saying in dentistry that you only have to floss the ones you want to keep. Brushing alone will not cut it. If you do not clean under your gums you will have infection (bleeding) and bone loss around your teeth. The infection gets worse and deeper and will travel into your bloodstream. If the infection gets into your bloodstream it effects your whole body.If you have deeper pockets (probing depths) that measure 4 and above,  even if you are flossing you may not be cleaning to the base of the pocket where the really nasty bacteria is hiding out. This will get where your floss will not. It does not replace floss and I tell my patient&#x27;s to use them together. If you don&#x27;t know what your readings are ask your Dental Hygienist. They should be checking your pockets every visit and recording them once a year. You should see your hygienist 2-4 times a year.              Periodontal disease has been linked to Heart disease, Stroke, Diabetes, Alzheimer&#x27;s, Pre-term low birthweight babies, Prostate Cancer....the list goes on. If your body is constantly fighting an infection in your mouth your immune system cannot do it&#x27;s job if you get a cold, a cut....you name it.             I am getting off my soap box. I love this product. I was skeptical at first but got deperate with a few hopeless patient&#x27;s and saw amazing results...and started using it myself. Also, it will not remove hard deposits if you haven&#x27;t been cleaned recently, you have to have a clean mouth to begin with.        It is like anything else....you have to use it daily to see results. I use it (even before I got braces). I have my parent&#x27;s using one because I believe in the product. My dad has the big countertop model and loves it...though it costs more. I have been using my second unit for over a year now. I buy them for my friends and they love them. I would not spend money on them if they didn&#x27;t work.    Good luck and good health! Hope this info helped some people.</li>
    <li> It worked well for the first 6 months or so. Then, water stopped coming out of it. I opened it to take a look at what the problem is and found that one of the plastic parts has warn down. This has only been used for about 6 month and that tells you how poor quality the parts used are.</li>
    <li> I use this every night, and along with my sonicare, my mouth always feels dentist cleaning clean. My teeth are very tightly spaced together, and I have sensitive gums, so regular flossing is always a daunting task. I got this from Walmart in hopes it would take the place of regular flossing. I started off with the blue tip for sensitive gums, and it just didn&#x27;t seem strong enough, so I upgraded to the clear tip. This one works great even for my sensitive gums. This water flosser does a great job at getting out stuck food particles and getting rid of plaque around and under the gumline. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it not charging like some of the other reviewers. The only problem I have ever faced is the tip turning when I don&#x27;t want it to.</li>
    <li> water last only 30 secs. then need another refill.  You need to tilt your head around, can not tilt the waterpik because the water must stay at the bottom.  Take a while to get use to.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Waterflosser model WP-360W is an excellent product.  After I brush with an electric toothbrush the waterpik removes additional material that has been trapped at the gum line.</li>
    <li> This item was recommended by our dentist so we purchased it.   That was a mistake. We are very disappointed as past waterpik devices have been great.   It does the job But :  It is extremely bulky to use    It is difficult to keep from getting water all over you.  Requires you to stand up straight over a sink to use it which makes placing in your mouth and letting water out of mouth extremely difficult.  We used to use an old style water pick which had a hose connected to a Water holder - that one worked very well.     Even our dentist, after seeing the device agreed that it is not well designed.</li>
    <li> Good waterpik! the battery last a long time (i use it almost 2 times a day - didn&#x27;t recharge the battery since 3 weeks). I would say that if the tank was transparent (other than blue) it will be easier to fill up. Good item!</li>
    <li> Because of some battery problems mentioned by others, I have waited to post this review.  I have now had the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W for almost a year.  Despite taking care with the battery by letting it run down as far as possible and then fully re-charging, the battery does seem weaker than upon arrival.  The jet stream is not quite as strong, and it needs to be kept plugged in most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if your main objective is improved oral health -- and this was my objective -- it&#x27;s done a great job.  Made a noticeable difference when it comes to dental cleanings -- noticeable to me and noticeable to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, well worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I love this little device. I bought this one to take along on vacations and visits. I keep it in the car for use when needed.  I have the larger one for home.  I have implants and the pic is necessary.  It gets all kinds of critters out of your teeth after eating!! Actually, I am writing this after I have had it for 1 1/2 years. Still love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased it to replace an identical one. Sadly the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t make it with a replaceable battery. My old one no longer held a charge and there are very few portables available on the market. That&#x27;s the throwaway culture we have today. The item works great and hopefully it&#x27;ll last me many years.</li>
    <li> Sometimes you just have to call it like it is.. this product stinks.  It sat on my counter for a year. Each time I used it I hoped the experience would be different.  It wasn&#x27;t.  Water everywhere, it&#x27;s bulky and it doesn&#x27;t clean your teeth at all.</li>
    <li> From the beginning I realized the reservoir was too small, but what was most frustrating was constantly charging it and then ultimately it did not hold the charge,causing me to THROW IT AWAY.</li>
    <li> Several years ago, I purchased the prior version of this device and loved it.  Small, easy transportable, easy to clean.  So, when it finally died, I bought the 360W without a moments hesitation.    Absolutely awful.  Where to start.  The prior version folded into a neat little package slightly larger than a deck of cards.  This thing is significantly larger, making it very difficult to pack.  Because its weird and bulky shape, it has twice caught the attention of airport security.  For the old unit, you shook it out, dried it with a paper towel and the world was beautiful.  In the 360W you cannot remove the water reserve to dry it.  I dread the thought of what is growing inside.      The prior unit had a very small nozzle on the end of a flexible cord that allowed easy maneuverability to hard to get places.  This thing is like moving a baseball bat around inside your mouth.  I have to travel periodically out of country so I was really amazed to discover that, unlike almost any other small personal appliance, the power connection was not dual voltage compliant.  Essentially useless in Europe or the middle east.    After about two months usage, the battery appears to be slowly dying.    Actively looking for something, ANYTHING, that will work as efficiently as the old water pic or, at least, better than this bulky, unsanitary clunker.</li>
    <li> At my last cleaning at the dentist, my hygienist recommended I purchase a waterpik because my gums were so red and irritated all the time, even though I brush twice a day and floss! So I found this one here on Amazon. I ordered it knowing the popularity of the Waterpik Brand. I have to say how awesome this product is! It is easy to use and my gums have healed within ONE week or less! It removed all excess food and plaque between teeth and around the gum line and leaves me teeth feeling so clean. I love it and I wish I didn&#x27;t wait so long to buy it! I totally recommend this for everyone, not just for people with gum issues.</li>
    <li> a good way of cleaning teeth and avoid dentist visit for high cost deep cleaning, the product is good so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this waterpick for my daughter to use.  It really helps get everything out of her orthodontic appliances.  She doesn&#x27;t like how strong the stream can be--even when we use the least heavy pick.</li>
    <li> I am please with the cordless waterpik.  The unit works very well.  It seems to hold the right amount water to complete the task of water flossing.</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself last year and this year sent one to my daughter and son.  We all love it!  The amazing way it thoroughly flushes out all the left over food in your teeth is fantastic.  I can&#x27;t believe I used to go to bed with all that crap stuck in my teeth.  Well, no more thanks to this great product!</li>
    <li> After 6 monhts of once a day use, my unit will not hold charge anymore, so I thought.  I tested the prongs of the ac-dc adapter and found out that they have no juice, zip, no voltage.  The charger is cheesy.  I spliced the unit end of the adapter cord into an old Radio Shack 120VAC-3VDC adapter and now my unit is charging again.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will last this time.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power. It arrived in suspect packaging. I wonder if it&#x27;s a Counterfeit of WaterPik.</li>
    <li> Need to do 3 fill ups per cleaning, and shooting the bottom back side of teeth is tricky.  Only pro is that I can go in the shower and blast away with out spraying everything in the bathroom</li>
    <li> Great for traveling.  The reservoir is small so you must refill 3 or 4 times per floss.&lt;br /&gt;Rated a three star only because I own the home model which has a much bigger reservoir, (5 Star).&lt;br /&gt;Really happy with service and item.</li>
    <li> Bought this to take with me for a summer job in Yellowstone since I knew I would be sharing a bathroom and could not leave the full size machine in the employee shared space. It did not hold a charge, and did not have enough power to flush out the food particles in the back of my mouth. When I returned home in October, I had my 2nd cleaning of he year. The results - my dentist said that I had more tarter and plaque than he had ever recorded for my teeth.</li>
    <li> Bought this for traveling so I didn&#x27;t have to pack my home unit one. Its cumbersome, hard to hold and heavy in one hand. Used it on one trip and now it&#x27;s packed away. I pack my big water pick now. It sounded like great idea but it was a waste of money. Filling it with water is challenging-maneuvering the pick around in your mouth holding the unit is clumsy and by the time you get the hang of it the water is gone and you need to refill it again.</li>
    <li> I have been amazed about how much more cleaning this unit does even after a good brushing!  It reaches places and removes particles that brushing never does.   Best dental product I have ever purchased, and it is easy to use after the first couple times of spraying water around the sink to get the feel of the best method of cleaning teeth and gums.  However long it will last I do NOT care, another one WILL take its place.!</li>
    <li> simple little instrument. works fine and my dentist rx.  So, for a few bucks and minimum effort maybe I can save my teeth and gums to look good at the final viewing?  Jerome S. Kaufman</li>
    <li> Bought this today.  After taking it out of the box I noticed the latch over the compartment that holds the water didn&#x27;t close all the way.  Decided to fill it and test it out anyway.  It did leak.  Will be returning this tomorrow and searching for a better designed water flosser.</li>
    <li> Similar to a Waterpik flosser I had that lasted 5 years and I was very happy with it. This one has a detachable water reservoir (the first one was one piece) and makes cleaning very easy. Also has a much improved charger connection.</li>
    <li> Works great. Gets food particles out of my teeth brushing and flossing do not.</li>
    <li> A bit disappointing. No sooner do you turn it on, it runs out of water.</li>
    <li> This product was a huge disapointment!    Underpowerd, clumsy, cumbersome to use, too small water capacity.   Really poorly designed.   Destigned for the dump.     I was really hoping for a good replacement for my travel water pic, which seems to last about 3 years and then gives out</li>
    <li> I purchased this water pic to use when I travel.  I guess it&#x27;s OK most of the time but doesn&#x27;t have near the water pressure that my home model has.</li>
    <li> It is a great product! very easy to use. I can not be without it now! It cleans your gums very well!  I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Despite whatever else this product might have going for it, it has one glaring defect - you might get one \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; of your teeth done before the reservoir is dry. An idiotic design. I bought mine locally and returned it the next day.</li>
    <li> My 14 yr. old granddaughter has braces she likes it real well but this is the 3rd one in a yr. it just stops running after a few months. This time we are keeping dates and receipt so if something happens we can get it replaced. would order another one if needed because we like it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using the waterpik waterflosser. I had bracers done and a permanent retainer placed behind my teeth. It has been fun to use and flossing is not a chore anymore. I would definitely recommend this to people who have permanent retainers! Although, i would have to fill it up about 3 times to go around completely to make sure it feels clean, as the water compartment is pretty small.</li>
    <li> We have a unit that works. The charger stopped working. We could buy a new charger, but this makes it so we have one in both bathrooms! Life is good!!!</li>
    <li> Short battery life, must be charged too frequently, otherwise does the job well. Short battery life, must be charged too frequently, otherwise does the job well.</li>
    <li> This is simply a Must Have for everyday use after brushing teeth.  It releases all other food particles toothbrush did not reach, massages the gums and ideal if you do not have the time to use traditional floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New review:  Bought 2 in December 2013.  We are now in January 2014 and one has already died out - not recharging.  Very annoying as the manufacturer should have addressed the no-charging issue by now, especially after all the negative reviews pertaining to that specific problem.  Will not buy that Waterpik Waterflosser model again.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of  the 360 Waterpic  in two years. The first lasted 12 months before the battery gave out. (Note- The batteries can not be replaced.) I called the customer service department at Waterpic with no satisfaction. I bought a second one last year and with the same results. After 11 months it to gave out because of the battery. I would think with all the complaints the manufacture has received about the short life span of this 360W Waterpic they would have done something. It seems they just don&#x27;t care!  I just purchased a different waterpic made by  ToiletTree  it has a 4 star rating by comsumers. Hopefully this will last more than 11 months.</li>
    <li> worked fine, and I loved it.  Then it broke two days after warranty was up, will not charge, will not function.  Bah.  I am so sick of buying trash that is not reliable.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product.  Over the years this is my third one.  Saves the gums ny getting deep down the tooth.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews of this item, I decided to order it and see for myself just how I liked it.  I have owned other Waterpik devices and have always been satisfied with their longevity and durability.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this model for travel and its size and shape is conducive for just that.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other reviews indicated water getting into the charger input.  I found it very easy to hold me finger over the charger input to prevent water infiltration while filling the device.  When held upright, the charger input is shielded by the enclosure surrounding the input.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you may have to fill the flosser twice while using, but a larger reservoir would mean a larger unit that would defeat its portability functions.&lt;br /&gt;It quickly removes food particles that flossing misses and if you need to irrigate&lt;br /&gt;your teeth while on the move, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works as described. My Dental Hygienist said it helps maintain healthy gums.&lt;br /&gt;Do not leave plugged in and dry off after using</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2, both worked great until the batteries failed, after 1-2 years.</li>
    <li> I had originally written a much more favorable review of this one-piece cordless WaterPik, but after some months of use, I have found it to have some real power problems.  Basically it has nowhere near the irrigation power of WaterPik&#x27;s plug-in models.  The nicad batteries seem to be the problem, with a severe case of memory effect.  I was having to discharge and recharge the unit every other day to get a few good irrigation sessions.  I finally threw in the towel and got a standard plug-in WaterPik, which has much more power and a much larger reservoir as well.  So -- I would recommend this cordless WaterPik only for travel use, where it does an adequate, though not superior, job of irrigation.</li>
    <li> Have had this product apx 2 months.  It was a great tool to keep my teeth clean however it has quit working already.  Also, could use a little larger water reservoir so you have a little more time to use it without having to refill it.</li>
    <li> The battery does not hold a charge and is not replacable.  Like most Waterpick products a good idea poorly executed by a company trading what was once a good name for profits.  I took it apart when it was apparant that it had become worthless due to the battery failure and found it cheaply constructed with plastic gears so I was bound to break down in otherways soon anyway.  I think the marketing idea here is to make a quick buck off an impulse purchase.  Stay clear of this one.</li>
    <li> I began using the WP-360 Water Pik in June 2005 at the suggestion of my dentist. At the time I was facing possible periodontal disease. That night I bought a Spinbrush AND a Water Pik. In 6 months of daily use of both PLUS flossing, my teeth &amp; gums had done a complete 180 and my dentist could not believe it was the same person.    My WP-360 Water Pik, after about 6 months, began to sometimes freeze up and stop jetting in the middle of my routine. Now, as of last week, it almost never even turns on anymore. The motor has gone bad. I cannot tell without tearing apart the Water Pik what the exact problem is though. After each use I had been plugging it back in to charge. Is that wrong? The machine no longer sounds normal either, in the rare instance that it runs for a few seconds. *edit: funny story--I was so angry this unit wouldn&#x27;t work anymore I threw it on the floor, then picked the pieces up, put it back together, and the thing works like new!     Of course I misplaced the receipt so I cannot get a free replacement. But I don&#x27;t see anything else on the market that I&#x27;d feel better about buying in its place. I guess I will buy one more, keep the receipt in the box, and hope for the best.    * update June 2007: Unfortunately, a few months more and the Pik stopped working again, after starting to sound like a jet engine. I threw it in the garbage about a month ago :( I am planning on trying InterPlak, which my father recommends.</li>
    <li> Battery dies early. If you do not need a portable water pick, prefer to buy the cord powered model. The cordless model WP-360W is underpowered, and is not possible change the NiCd battery.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with this gaget I just had to respond. I have braces and very sensitive gums and have always hated flossing. This product was so great; it was fast and easy and definitely did the job. It was a lot bigger than I was expecting, but other than that it worked great.</li>
    <li> I bought two, one for each bathroom.  After a month of use, we like &#x27;em, particularly the hand held size.  Plenty of oomph, without the counter space problem of the bigger models.  It does have a smaller reservoir, so no dawdling, but you can get all eight banks of teeth done in one fill-up if you turn it off to switch hands.  We find the location of the on/off buttons very convenient.</li>
    <li> Very good value and a sturdy product; excellent for traveling.  Product arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> My first time using a waterpik, it was recommended by my dentist but water gets every where,are they suppose to be that messy?</li>
    <li> I had one exactly like this for years until it wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore, so I knew what I was getting.  As always, the service from Amazon was excellent and the package arrived promptly and in perfect shape.  I like the waterpik mainly because it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a poorly designed product.  The reservoir is small and has to be refilled once or twice during each use.  It is difficult to fill.  It is also difficult to empty completely and it soon smelled like mold.</li>
    <li> This is the second Waterpik, like this that we have had, Son is disabled and has very little hand use. This is easy for him to use.</li>
    <li> Poorly advertised, cumbersome to use and hard to refill barrel or remove from its base.This model doesn&#x27;t have battery capacity which is especially beneficial for International travel.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product, but like most big company goods, it is built to simply barely outlast it&#x27;s warranty, so you will have to replace it, thereby ensuring high profits for those corporations who build them overseas at extremely low overhead then sell them at high markup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different Waterpiks over the years,   including this one.  They all crack and break easily.  They must not use much plasticizer in their manufacturing.    This portable one tipped over on the sink counter-top,   and shattered not-unlike glass, ten days after I got it.  A second one slipped off the towel onto the floor and broke   the tip in half, and broke the reservoir cover off.   The motor comes on, but it just spins without pumping anything.    The things are kind of noisy when people are sleeping,   so it was nice to have a portable one to use away from the bedrooms.    The non-portable one, (I&#x27;ve had two), my first one, years ago,   lasted a while, but the hose cracked and broke.    I was able to put the remaining hose back   on to the handle, but it just broke again, and then the plastic where the   hose attaches broke.  Their plastic is so brittle!  The last one I bought, I took back, because the rubber was already cracking,   and I think the plastic reservoir was already cracked, still in the package!    It sounds like I am rough with these things; I am not.    Things I own, generally, look new, and last forever.  I&#x27;ll buy another brand in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Waterpik Waterflosser since my dentist recommended it&#x27;s use more than fifteen years ago. I am always amazed at the food particles that are dislodged even after brushing. He did caution me to use a gentle flow to avoid gum damage.&lt;br /&gt;This Waterflosser has a wide selection of speeds and flow tips. Do empty the water reservoir after each use. This helps with keeping lime and other deposits in the water from clogging the  battery charge intake. Easy to use, charge, and clean. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> even though amazon took for ever to ship this thing, it worked well when it was new, but after few uses the pressure is not the same, even if fully charged. but over all you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have had this for @ two months now. Originally I thought it was great. Now I am growing concerned over the how often it is going to require charging. The first charge lasted almost a month. The charges since then are not last nearly as long.</li>
    <li> Huge disappointment. I had the Panasonic EWDA10W Oral Irrigator but had trouble finding a replacement tip locally, so I just bought this Waterpik. Waterpik 1)does not have the same power, 2)goes only a few uses between lengthy charges, and 3)in less than a year, doesn&#x27;t even charge anymore. (So off the hazardous-waste-recycling-center it goes.) Luckily, I kept the quality Panasonic and I just ordered the replacement tip from Amazon. I would advise you to NOT waste your money on the Waterpik WP-360W.</li>
    <li> probably waterpik on purpose puts into this device the worst battery possible that can be found on the market, in order to force customers buying it more frequently. This was my 4-th one, After 2 month usage the battery died on all 4 of them.</li>
    <li> too tall to fill using the bathroom sink. Very messy. Tip kept rotating which made it hard to reach the places I wanted to. Bulky. doesn&#x27;t hold enough liquid.</li>
    <li> If I could give no stars I would. I REALLY needed this waterpik, I just got braces and am having trouble flossing. It shows up, NOT in original packaging even though it was supposed to be new. The plug prongs are black as if they had been charred. I still tried to charge it for 24 hours as it said and it didn&#x27;t even work. Returned it and plan on just buying one at a regular retailer.</li>
    <li> Great except  I broke the 2 pics and had to buy some extras.  Actually I will blame it on the monkeys as I live in Costa Rica.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for two years, I believe. I love it and would buy it again. I read all the reviews before purchase and there were many negative comments, but I resonated with some positive reviewers personalities and bought it anyway. So glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes your teeth to a new level of clean. Follow the directions - use the weaker nozzle first, so your gums get used to the pressure. I use this at least three times a week. I&#x27;ve had no issue with charging or usage. It&#x27;s small and easy to put in a drawer or on your vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, I filled it twice during each use, which is no big deal. Now I have it down pat and finish on one fill. That&#x27;s the benefit of WAITING UNTIL YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THE PRODUCT to review it. I would buy it again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK product for a few weeks or a few months. In my case, after about a month, it stopped holding a charge. This makes it pretty much useless and aggravating. I see this is a common review of this product.</li>
    <li> Love it. I just hope the battery outlasts my last one. This is a wonderful option if you have trouble with flossing.</li>
    <li> I got this thing a few weeks ago, recommended by my dentist (winner of best dentist in metro 3 or 4 years in a row) They&#x27;re awesome... stephanielollerdds.com (near santana row/valley fair). Tell them I sent you (I don&#x27;t get anything for this, they&#x27;re just really nice people). They have the best scheduling system, always SUPER friendly. It&#x27;s no mistake they keep winning...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the Waterpick... It takes some time getting used to the piercing jet of water tickling your mouth and spraying every which way but into you&#x27;re mouth (it can be messy), but DON&#x27;T GIVE UP. After a few uses, maybe a week or so you&#x27;ll figure out aiming and control, and then I switched to the more power stream. Then this little water shooter turns into a warm (mouthwash, put a little into the water bin) shower for your gums! Oh boy! There are other attachments, I fill up the bin 4 times, one for each (top/bottom, inside/outside). And there are newer models also, but this one makes my teeth feel fantastic, especially paired with my electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> adapter did not work.&lt;br /&gt;adapter and waterpik It is also the second-hand products.&lt;br /&gt;The seller is unconscionable.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> okay so I was so afraid to buy this for my mom as a Christmas gift. She has every gadget possible and is very savvy! Okay I waited one year to write this review JUST to be sure. I asked her on Christmas eve how she liked last year&#x27;s present and she though a minute and said oh yeah it is AMAZING I love it. I asked her if she any problems with the battery. She said no absolutely and AWESOME gift. I was relieved because she can be high maintenance at times, but generally easy to please. These bad reviews are unfortunate because it really is a good and reliable product. I recommend it. Mom mom can be hard to please!</li>
    <li> It was great at first.  Loved it, loved it.  Then after 4 months it just stopped.  It cost too much to only last 4 months.  Won&#x27;t buy another one like it.  Too bad, good concept, poor construction...</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, except my 1st one lasted only 5 months, so purchased a second.  The battery in this unit is not replaceable.  It does have a warranty - however I did not have the sales slip available to take advantage of that.  I have saved everything on this second unit just in case............</li>
    <li> The Waterpik I purchased works well with a week&#x27;s worth of battery power between recharging and I was pleasantly surprised when I went to the dentist at the improvement in my teeth and gums from using it.</li>
    <li> We just replaced our plug-in Waterpik with a cordless and I *HATE* IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t hold it upright and it&#x27;s less than full, the jet stream sputters&lt;br /&gt;It has just high and low speed settings compared to the adjustable settings of the plug-in.&lt;br /&gt;The water depletes way too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s large and awkward.&lt;br /&gt;I get the charge port wet, not to mention my face, shirt and mirror as I struggle to adjust the jet angle, find the off switch or contort myself to get the backside of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we didn&#x27;t shell out $55 on it, I&#x27;d take a mallet to it.</li>
    <li> This replaces the same waterpik I purchased a few years ago that suddenly broke down.  I went with the same brand because my dentist recommended this brand far above others for help removing plaque.  I prefer this model over other larger ones because it takes up less room in a small bathroom (smaller footprint)</li>
    <li> The Water Pik WP-360 is a great product concept and I enjoyed using it regularly, especially in the shower. Pressure (using the expert tip) is good while the unit is new and the batteries are fresh. Unfortunately after owning four of these over two years, I can say with authority this product is simply not built to withstand more than a few months of regular use regardless of how well it is cared for. If WP addressed the issues of poor battery characteristics and unacceptable reliability, this product would be a winner. Instead, I recommend the Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator which is not rechargeable (uses AA batteries), has a smaller tank, and does not create as much pressure. However, it is well made and travels better since it is collapsible and does not need a charger. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Battery died after 4 months of use. I believe I charged it regularly and had a good maintainance.</li>
    <li> As mentioned before the size of the reservoir is limited. I have to fill it twice to clean my teeth but it seemed to be the better alternative for me than having a big unit on my vanity. I especially like not having a cord. I&#x27;m very happy with my choice of buying this product.</li>
    <li> This item stopped functioning within two weeks of its arrival at my home.  To be fair, after e mailing the Waterpik company, they agreed to send another Waterpik to me after 15 days (to date the item has not arrived).  The water reservoir is too small for the unit, and requires two fills, at least, to properly cleanse the teeth and gums.  The charger ran out after one or two uses, even the first few days, in spite of the fact that I charged it for 16 hours the first time, as advised in the instruction manual, and had to be recharged again over night.  This item is made in China, home of (lately) massive product recalls all over the world.  This item lacks product integrity, certainly won&#x27;t improve China&#x27;s current standing in the world of manufacturing, and, I think, the Waterpik company lacks integrity for selling this thing.  Maybe their other products are good.  This one isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> i have used 2 of these now. both worked for about 2-3 weeks. then the pressure got so low.... sigh.  i think it&#x27;s a crime to put something so poorly made on the market.  shameless!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great idea--as a dental professional, I fully support oral irrigation.  And like other reviewers, I have had two.  The first lost its oomph and would not charge after a few months.  I did contact WaterPik by e-mail and they did send me a replacement.  Great customer service, but it proved to be the same.</li>
    <li> While this is better than using no waterpick at all, and cordless is nice, my experience with this over 6 months has been:    CONS    - Battery wears down quick.    - Over time battery holds less and less of charge. After 6 months I&#x27;m lucky to get through 1 or 2 full sessions without it getting \\&quot;weak\\&quot;.    - Water resevoir only holds enough to do one side of your mouth. Not hard to re-fill, but a little annoying to have to keep stopping and refilling it for a thorough cleaning.    PROS    - Better than just flossing, noticably cleaner / better feeling mouth. Better breath.    - Much more enjoyable than flossing.    - Cheap and portable.    - Once you upgrade to a real waterpick system this will make a great squirtgun, you&#x27;ll win every time in short battles ;-)    OVERALL    Wish I&#x27;d spent the extra $16 for a full powered, higher-end system, and will be ditching this for one soon.</li>
    <li> Waterpik WP-360W Hand-held Cordless Rechargeable Dental Water Jet   After many succesful years with a tradtional water pik, the water line failed.  In an attempt to upgrade, i chose this new model.  The results were extremely dissapointing.  First, the dispenser nozzle keeps popping of when trying to irrigate.  Second, the tank is too small doing entire mouth on one fillup.  Third, filling is tricky with lots of spillage when trying to fill.  This results in waste if you are using more than water for irrigation.  All in all very dissapointing.  I would have returned, but had waited longer than 30 days for first use.  I would NOT reccomend this unit.</li>
    <li> I ordered the cordless Waterpik, it arrived in record time, but it only held a charge for a week and then quit altogether.  I called Waterpik and they immediately sent me another one, but that wouldn&#x27;t pump the water, so I called again and decided to get the electric model.  It arrived in record time and I love it.  It&#x27;s much easier to handle, the reservoir holds more than enough water, but to my mind, the biggest thing is the customer service at Waterpik.  Each person I talked to was friendly, and very, very helpful.  I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ve been treated so nicely.</li>
    <li> Had this for a few weeks with no problem and it still holds its first charge.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the complaint is about this.  This is a great product and convenient.  Pros: Takes up less space, easy to fill up, can take on the go.  Cons: Have to have a large sink to fill up, wipe down after use.  You have to sacrific a little bit for the convenience of it.  If you do only get 2-3 years out of it, that is only $22, which is not too bad and seems about right to other waterpics.  All in all, it is a great product, just wipe it down after you use it with your towel or tissue, so the water doesn&#x27;t get in the AC plug.</li>
    <li> This is a very functional,and convenient waterpik.One that has an adequate water and pressure chamber.Also it requires minimal vanity space.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I know this is a topic that will have everyone holding their breath but, honestly, for the price, this is a great little portable Waterpik.  This one is the 3rd of its type for me and I have used it for on and off over 7 or 8 years.  I bought it because my dentist insisted I start using a Waterpik.  I use a larger one at my home but when I began traveling on my job I needed a portable one.  Then I began pet sitting and used it when I was staying at someone else&#x27;s home.  Now I am serving in the Peace Corps in Ukraine.  In all instances, it has been very handy.  And my dentist is happy and my teeth are cleaner.  What more can I ask!!</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this particular model (360), over the 450, due to it&#x27;s larger reservoir.  I use it in the shower, as was also recommended to me.  I find that I have to fill the reservoir twice per use.  Filling the reservoir in the shower is relatively easy and the entire process takes me only about 3-4 minutes.  The waterpik seems to hold a charge for a reasonable length of time.  I&#x27;ve had the waterpik in the shower for 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t had to recharge yet.  Replacement waterpik did not perform as well as the first.  Neither did the third.  I&#x27;ve switched to another brand.</li>
    <li> I have bought three of these for myself and my daughter. I love it</li>
    <li> Bottom line....it&#x27;s worth the cost, whether it last for a week or eternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m soooooo lousy at remembering to brush my teeth until recently. I added this WP-360W waterflosser about 4months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My latest cleaning was impressive!  Gums were healthier and less plaque.  My dental hygienist noticed the difference the moment she looked in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so impressed that I took the risk of offending my daughter and her family.  I bought this Waterpik Waterflosser plus the Sonicare  toothbrush for my daughter and her family....a set for both of their bathrooms.  Was a bit concerned that she&#x27;s take offencse, but she likes the gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greatest news in my world is that my 15 year old grandson is now cleaning his teeth without being nagged!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the performance of this Waterpik yet (I&#x27;ve had it for  months).  I always dry it off before attaching the recharger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare that I use is, at least, 10 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if this Waterpik has to be replaced every year, it has paid for itself already.  Think about it....If you have to spend $$ w for a good toothbrush/Sonicare and the Waterpik, it would cost $$$ to $$$$ to  repair the damage done to your teeth.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t plan on taking this thing to Europe, unless you&#x27;ll only be there for a few days. Once the battery is dead there is no way to charge it from a 220v outlet.</li>
    <li> It broke the first time I put it in my over night suitcase! Now I can&#x27;t use it cause the pick is stuck partly inside!</li>
    <li> both items make great gifts, waterpik as posted, in great condition, instructions included. Scooter and helmet, my granddaughter has the American girl doll and loves all items which goes with it.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use. The on and off button is placed so that you can hold the Pik and have your finger in place at all times. I found this to be very helpful the first time I used it. I could start and stop at each tooth if so desired. &lt;br /&gt;My daughter tried it and liked it very much as well and is going to purchase one for herself.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this item.  The water pressure is very weak. I am sorry I bought it. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> i simply love this product...very handy, very versatile, easy to use.!!!</li>
    <li> This dental cleaning aide does what it is supposedto do and more.  Your oral hygeine will be greatly enhanced and your dentist will be happy too!!</li>
    <li> Now this thing worked famously for about a week. After that I can&#x27;t tell if the motor is freezing-up, or the battery is going out. I was really hopeing to defy the odds and have this model work for me but alas I am not the chosen one. Returned to the store and bought the upgrade. I see that this new model is as loud as a leaf blower with a bad cylinder, and has more leaks than a water hose after it was run over by a lawn mower. we&#x27;ll see if I have luck. If not I will be forced to buy the Panasonic. Funny how these oral irrigators become \\&quot;must have\\&quot; after a few days. It still hurts my gums like heck. Hopefully this is a result of it working. Anyway wish me luck!!!</li>
    <li> We got the Hand-held Cordless Rechargeable Dental Water Jet, and &lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t believe how much \\&quot;junk\\&quot; we had been missing with ordinary &lt;br /&gt;brushing! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great product...</li>
    <li> I was nervous buying this after reading some mixed reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I got it.  I still need to use regular floss in some trouble areas depending on what I&#x27;ve eaten, but overall the Waterpik is really improving my gums.  I usually have to refill the unit twice to feel like I&#x27;ve done a thorough job, but I don&#x27;t consider that to be detrimental since a bigger reservoir would be much harder to handle.</li>
    <li> Works great!  My mouth feels very clean after using the Waterpik.  I hope that my next dental checkup bears this out.</li>
    <li> Good, but I wish it held more water.</li>
    <li> I HAD DETERIORATING RECEDING GUMS AND LOOSENING OF MY FRONT LOWER TEETH-BUT NO CAVITIES AT 56 YEARS;&lt;br /&gt;THIS GOOD- UNIT KNOCKED ALL KINDS OF FOOD PARTICLES - I USE AFTER EVERY BRUSHING--I WAS AMAZED I THOUGHT MY TEETH WERE BRUSHED GOOD-THIS UNIT KNOCKED ALL KINDS OF FOOD PARTICLES FROM A BEEF STEW INTO THE SINK FROM BETWEEN MY TEETH. EVEN BETTER-THIS HOLDS A CHARGE FOR DAILY 3X/DAY FLOSSINGS BETTER THAN EXPECTED! NOT ONLY MY GUMS IMPROVED IN 2 WEEKS AS PROMISED--IT RUNS A MONTH ON A CHARGE!</li>
    <li> This is my second one  and I love it.   I use it daily and rely on it to keep my teeth and gums clean and healthy and my mouth fresh.   It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to maintain, and for me an essential part of my daily oral hygeine.   I recently gave this as a gift to 3 persons, all of whom are now addicted to using it as I am. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone should have one of these.</li>
    <li> Battery lasted about 2 months. Other than that, it worked pretty good, but with a dead battery that won&#x27;t recharge - USELESS!!!</li>
    <li> I accidentally dropped the first one and broke, after a year of good service, had to replace it right away...work really well and is compact enough to take it whenever I travel.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0002AHY6Q Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W]]The pressure is totally inadequate.  The original waterpik was great, but not this version.</li>
    <li> The power of the water flow is good, not too hard and not too soft. But the lack of any charging indicator on this Waterpik is frustrating. Even after leaving it plugged in all day it still seems to lose power in mid-cleaning. The cord that attaches into the device feels cheap and I&#x27;m never sure whether or not it is actually in there (again, no indicator light).</li>
    <li> Replacement for my old waterpik-------This one actually holds a charge longer, and has a more powerful spray.  Paid less than for my previous cordless Waterpik------am glad I accidently dropped it.</li>
    <li> I have had two of these WP-360W models and both lost their ability to hold a charge.  The first lasted about a year, certainly no longer, and the last one quit in less than a year.  Have always run them completely down to avoid nicad memory imprinting.  Battery technology is much more advanced that what Waterpic chose to use and they should be ashamed of themselves.  This problem alone makes the unit a rip off, at best!  I just can&#x27;t understand why WaterPik would offer such a sorry excuse for a product.  Forgive me for rating it so high but they insisted on at least one star.  They do clean just fine but do need a larger reservoir.  They are in fact a lot cleaner to have around than their big corded brothers, and they travel as well as one would expect.  I must be completely stupid so I am ordering the newer more expensive Cordless Ultra with even less water capacity and hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> This item carries too little water to do a good job.  Other wise it is of good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the product 3 months. I purchased this product because I&#x27;m a middle aged person with braces and found the full size water pik setup to be invaluable dealing with the situation.  If this product didn&#x27;t have the following shortcomings I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars because it is a tool I use every day.  Design issue #1: The battery. The water pressure just isn&#x27;t there anymore and this thing is only 3 months old. As it runs you can hear it slow down as it pumps the water #2 The charger inlet falls open easily and water gets in the charging area. BAD.  #3. There is no good way to clean out the water holder and it goes stale.  I&#x27;ve taken to flushing it with mouth wash and storing it open and upside down.</li>
    <li> I love the waterpik - my old one broke so I was happy to get it replaced&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had alittle more power</li>
    <li> Nice little and very handy. Battery once fully charged before first use lasted probably around 2-3 weeks without recharging.</li>
    <li> Initially would not hold a charge. Called mfg, talked me thru reset, happened again. Returned under warranty. New one worked great for 3 months. On/off switch is now acting up and will likely poop out soon.</li>
    <li> Waterpik Water flosser is excellent, I had a previous one that got broken, that is why I order&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;another one, i really enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> This is my second Waterpik of this model.  The first lasted over 3 years.  With the exception of a change to the charging port it is identical to the previous model.  It does a good job of removing loose debris after brushing and flossing.  It does a good job of stimulating the gums.  My only annoyance is with the placement of the buttons.  The on, off and eject buttons are all very close to each other.  I operate those buttons with my thumb, and thumbs being thumbs, I occasionally hit the wrong button, even though they are all different shapes and sizes.  Since this is my second unit, it obviously is not a big deal and didn&#x27;t prevent me from replacing the old unit with a new unit of the same model.</li>
    <li> I am still getting used to it - right now the water tends to squirt all over the place. However, I do get a good clean feel in my mouth after using it.</li>
    <li> I use this with some Crest ProWash Mouthwash every night and my teeth and gums are the healthiest they have ever been. I wish I had started using this product 60 years ago, and I would still have all of my original teeth with crowns and fillings, etc. This keeps my gums very healthy. For $30 this prevents dental bills every 6 months.</li>
    <li> I got becuz it does not take up much room on counter BUT U have to refill it with water 3-4 times while using so its a hassle and I put it at the back of a closet :(</li>
    <li> makes your mouth feel great.  can&#x27;t beat the price.  try it, I gave everyone in the family one and they have all gotten thumbs up from their dental hygenists.</li>
    <li> This is the second Waterpik Waterflosser I have owned.  The first one came with a 2 year warranty and it lasted just over 2 years.  I noticed on the replacement Waterpik that the warranty had been reduced to just 1 year.  It lasted just over one year.  I can&#x27;t tell if the battery or the on/off switch is why this last unit failed.  Just before the Waterpik gave completely out, you had to hold the On button in to keep it running.  When it worked, it was nice.  Refilling the reservoir was not that big of a deal and I kept it on the battery charger when not in use so battery power was not an issue.  Occasionally the nozzle would clog slightly and reduce the water pressure.  I found clearing the nozzle annoying and I didn&#x27;t think you should have to do that.  Over time it seemed like the water pressure reduced but it still did a pretty good job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to look for something better.  However, if I had to, I&#x27;d get another Waterpik knowing that it wasn&#x27;t going to last much longer than a year provided the price (for 1 year of operation) was good.</li>
    <li> I PREFER THIS TO THE NEWER ONES.  WILL BUY AGAIN IGLOO I BREAK THIS ONE AD I DID THE LAST.  GOOD PRICE&lt;br /&gt;TOO.</li>
    <li> Great transaction! Great product!</li>
    <li> In addition to the other complaints about this product, on my unit, the rubber o-ring failed after only a few uses.  Additionally, the charging port is protected by a rubber stopper to keep water out, which does not work all that well.  I upgraded to the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet which is an outstanding product.  If you have the vanity space in your bathroom, and an electrical outlet nearby, then I highly recommend the slightly more expensive model.</li>
    <li> Waterpik WP-360W Hand-held Cordless Rechargeable Dental Water Jet:      The fact that the rechargeable does not have a cord to get tangled-up, and that it cost less than the regular type, was my main reason&#x27;s for buying it.      The only problems I have found are that it does not last as long as the corded Waterpik (my first one lost it&#x27;s battery charging ability after about one year of constant use).  And the water reservoir is so small I need to fill it two to three times while using.    However, I am very pleased with it.  And would only suggest that the maker change the design to include a replaceable battery so users could just replace the battery instead of buying a whole new Waterpik.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model water pic for several years now, and this one that I recently bought, is like new and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Harry Freedman</li>
    <li> I bought this product upon the recommendation of my dental professional.  The first unit lasted about a year.  The second unit lasted maybe 6 months.  It needed to be recharged often, and then finally would not charge at all.  My next purchase will be from a different manufacturer.  Unfortunately, I did not have the receipt for either unit, so could not get a replacement, but maybe that&#x27;s a good thing in the long run - less frustration.</li>
    <li> everything worked out fine thank you</li>
    <li> This is an all around good product. It has been very effective in helping me with my teeth cleaning regimen.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible to use this without making a mess and getting water all over yourself. Hate it and it will end up in the garage sale bin.</li>
    <li> Affordable and works great.  Already got good checkups at the Dentist.  That&#x27;s always a plus.  I highly recommend it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Now a daily part of my dental routine, this convenient apparatus should be a must for all those my age (over 60) who still have and want to keep their dental health in top shape! Easy to use and operate.</li>
    <li> Looks like a good product, and worked well when purchased.  After five or six weeks, the battery will no longer charge. The battery is &#x27;factory installed&#x27; and can&#x27;t be replaced, so the item is junk.  Would be a five star if they installed a quality battery and a good charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found a phone number and called.  They asked for the serial number and my address and shipped a new one.  It&#x27;s been fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this flosser a month ago and it has helped my teeth and gums a lot.  I haven&#x27;t put mouthwash in it yet though, because I want to keep this flosser as clean as possible so I don&#x27;t have to wash it a lot.  This is definitely a must have if you have to travel.  This does not run on batteries.</li>
    <li> This is a follow up to my earlier one star review.  I&#x27;m increasing my rating because Waterpik is sending me a free replacement unit. It did require 3 calls to customer support over several days as they wanted me to try several fixes, none of which helped.  The customer service people I talked with were easy to reach, very pleasant and helpful. I give Waterpik very high marks for customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, the replacement unit will hold up.</li>
    <li> The life expectancy for this item is approximately 2 years for us.  It takes up less space than the full model.  It is very convenient and does a great job.  We are pleased with our purchase.</li>
    <li> I had one of these years ago and I found this one on line. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. It does a great job, I recharge it every three days. It has strong water pressure and does not take up much space. I fill it 2 times during each use.</li>
    <li> It is great and we travel all over the world with it. Just love it as I always hated flossing with the thread. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Shanta</li>
    <li> I really really hate flossing but man I love using this to floss!! its a lot nicer then the string and a lot easier to use!!! really recommend getting this!!Great for little kids and teenager!! my daughter and me use it and shes 16 and loves it!!!</li>
    <li> it does what it is design, to do keeps charge for a couple of days,wil recomend it, good for the price</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughters one.loved it the other have not used it yet.  My daughter loves it and her husband wants one</li>
    <li> I already had one I purchased at Bed, Bath and Beyond. I purchased this one just like the other one for my husband but at a nice discount- he is as pleased with his as I have been with mine. It&#x27;s easy to purchase new tips for it anywhere including the drugstore or here (cheaper!)</li>
    <li> This product was not at all what I was expecting. First of all, it is so powerful that you practically have to use it in the shower to keep from drenching your entire bathroom. Water GUSHES out of your mouth! One of the attachments is supposed to be more \\&quot;gentle.\\&quot; Not so! My poor gums hate me. Whatever you do, don&#x27;t use this product to clean out your tonsils (those who still have tonsils may know what I mean): it kind of works, but they bleed so badly it&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother has an older model WaterPik that is gentle and wonderful, so I know a good product is out there. Buy a different product than this one!</li>
    <li> Very, very noisy, and adding water to it in the standard bathroom sink is very difficult.  A kitchen sink would work better, but who takes care of their dentition in the kitchen?  The battery doesn&#x27;t last very long at all and you&#x27;ve got to recharge it every few days.  It doesn&#x27;t hold much water at all, and I only bought it because of the limited space on my bathroom vanity. For someone who is sold on using oral irrigation, it would make a good addition to your shave kit if you travel a lot.  After about a month it just quit working altogether.  I guess you shouldn&#x27;t expect much for $21.</li>
    <li> Reservoir is too small. YOu have to hold it at an odd angle and then keep refilling it every 15 seconds.</li>
    <li> This product is really good. Does what it promises. I really don&#x27;t like to floss, but my dentist recommends it (better for your teeth he says) so he told me to get this product. Works wonders...you receive 4 mouth pieces good for the whole family. Great product. The only thing is when charging the unit you have to take off the mouth piece, for some reason having the mouth piece on will kill the battery faster</li>
    <li> The insertable \\&quot;piks\\&quot; will not stay in place when using the product, they dislodge and water goes all over the place.  I have tried to tighten them but that does not seem to be an option.  Can&#x27;t use the product.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the lid on mine can be tough to open.    I like it and am buying one for a family member.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet...its reservoir doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to do the job. It holds enough for about 10 seconds worth of use. I found myself refilling it about 2-3 times per use. Returned it to the store a week later.</li>
    <li> I am about to throw out the third WP-360 that I have purchased.  The first lasted a few months and I loved it.  It cleaned between my teeth and took little space on the countertop.  But then it died.  So I gave in after a few months without and bought a second Waterpik cordless.  It died after a much shorter period, a few weeks I believe.  I gave up on irrigating between my teeth.    But I really needed a dental irrigator; dental floss does not do the trick for me.  I had gone months and months without and I could see how my teeth and gums were suffering.  So I gave in, and bought another one. I thought this time would be different...........And this third one died much quicker.  I found it hard to believe. I don&#x27;t know who I am more frustrated with....myself for buying another one or WATERPIK for selling an inferior product.  I just assumed that they would improve their product.  And I believe they will, which is why I write this review.    WATERPIK--please improve your product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> It works  BUT  great Idea for handheld but does not hold enough water. You run out of water to fast and have to refill handle. Plus you dribble down all over handle and have to wash it every time. So my next one will be with the hose and a large tank for water. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bought one last year and it broken when it hit the bathroom floor so I bought another one. The dentist said I had much less plaque on my teeth and less cavaities. My gums bleed less also.  Excellent product and I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Despite the negative reviews,  I purchased this product because there are no electrical outlets in my bathroom.   I should have heeded the advice!  The product did cease to hold a charge within a couple of months of purchase.  The resevoir is indeed too small.  Mine ended up in the garbage.  I now own a Water Pic with a cord which I use in the kitchen!  It&#x27;s fine.  Please save your money and do not purchase this item!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the poor design of the turning (360 degrees) head.  Can you imagine the walls of the bathroom after you finished using it?  OK, now please....fix the poor design before someone comes up with a law suit against the manufacturer for water suffocation.    The poor design includes the three buttons (can the release one be moved somewhere else?).  While trying to hold the head from turning, the ON and OFF buttons have to be under your finger before the water suffocation, then the head comes OUT.  Well, I have ducted tape the head, so I can have one finger on the ON and another on the OFF buttons again before suffocation.  Yes, you read it right, \\&quot;DUCT Tape.\\&quot;  Lucky I that I had some white DUCT Tape in the house.  I have no problem with the water tank size like others do.    The health and hygiene of my gums are very important to me, and the waterpik does the job.  The portable waterpik design could be better if the manufacturer wanted to.   Reviews are available.</li>
    <li> I had mine for a couple of months and then I threw it in the trash. It was unwieldy, had minimal water pressure, and the jet tip wouldn&#x27;t stay in place. It didn&#x27;t add anything to my oral hygeine and it was taking up space on the counter. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> My dentist talked me into getting braces in my 40s, and I can&#x27;t imagine surviving through orthodontics without a Waterpik -- there is no other way to do what these machines do.    Having said that, Waterpik&#x27;s quality control is dreadful. I have a personal model at home, and -- I am not making this up -- I had to send it back for replacement twice in the first week of operation. The woman in customer service actually said \\&quot;Well, maybe the third time will be a charm\\&quot;, and in fact I have had no further trouble with that unit in three years.    I own two WP-360W Waterpiks, one that I bought two years ago (and still going strong), and one that I bought on vacation last month. I used the new unit without incident for three weeks, and then it suddenly stopped operating. There was no transition period during which it worked intermittently or slowly; it abruptly stopped working, and as soon as I finish writing this review, I am going to throw it away.    When it works, the WP-360W is a great product. Sure, it is noisy, and sometimes the tip pops off and spatters you with water because the designers located the \\&quot;eject\\&quot; button for the tip right next to the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button. But it does a good job, and it&#x27;s a \\&quot;must\\&quot; if you wear braces and like to travel.     I would strongly encourage you to keep your receipt for any Waterpik product you buy, because -- if my experience is typical -- you are likely to encounter quality problems. It&#x27;s really a shame that their manufacturing QA mars what would otherwise be an excellent product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0002AHY6Q Waterpik WP-360W Hand-held Cordless Rechargeable Dental Water Jet]]  This is the 3rd of these that I have owned.  The first 2 lasted about 1 year each.  The first stopped being able to be charged, the second because something became disconnected internally and it wouldn&#x27;t pump any more. This device cost me less than $30, far less than the $102 I pay for teeth cleaning twice a year and far less than the jaw bone implant I had before I started using a waterpik.  It fits my hand nicely and is easy to store in my small bathroom and I clean between my teeth and gum in one fill of the reservoir.  I start by brushing my teeth, then flossing, then waterpik and finally use a mouth rinse to disinfect.  I will definitely buy another when the current one stops working.</li>
    <li> I bought this shortly after I got braces. I chose this model because I don&#x27;t have the counter space in my bathroom for the big tank and it was a reasonable price.  I only use it once a day and worked great.  I did notice that I had to fill up the tank 2 times sometimes 3 to get through one cleaning.  I am ok with that, its not that annoying.  However, after about 4 months of use it completely died and wouldn&#x27;t charge. Since this model has a 2-year warrenty I contacted Waterpik and they sent me a brand new unit with in a week.  They suggessted that you remove the pressure tip after each use because water that is left inside it can seeps back down inside and in the battery housing (it doesn&#x27;t tell you that in the directions).  I have done that since I got the new one and have had no issues.  I don&#x27;t have to charge it very often.  I was very please with Waterpik for quickly taking care of the situation.  I think others who are complaing about the battery losing charge and buying a new one should have taken advantage of the warranty information.  Overall, I do notice a difference with the use of this water jet, it helps a lot with braces.  Even though I did have charging problems too, I was very pleased with the quick response from Waterpik.  I would recommend this to any one who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot or doesn&#x27;t have room for a large tank model.</li>
    <li> The waterpik is a great product - this is my second one.  The first one is mine and the one I just bought is for my daughter.  I have nothing bad to say - it works and it&#x27;s great.  Btw, the first one I bought has been in use for three years with no problem whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Portable and cheap this Waterpik has worked great I recommend it with my eyes closed! Just be careful and follow instructions!</li>
    <li> After only a few months of use it quit taking a charge. While shopping for a replacement, I happened to read some reviews and found that others had similar experiences and one reviewer had replaced the connectors between the unit and the charger. That gave me an idea. I simply cleaned the contact points, plugged it up, and after a few hours it is all charged up and working like new.  I used one of those toothpicks with a fuzzy brush tip and some warm soapy water and was careful to dry it thoroughly before plugging it in to charge.</li>
    <li> DOESN&#x27;T HOLD A CHARGE for more than a year!!!! I am so disappointed in this product. At first, it was great. It has a lot of power and I could use it easily without having to recharge it so frequently. Now, it will not hold a charge for more than 5 seconds.AGHHHH!</li>
    <li> Have used one before, so I knew it would meet my expectations.  Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t hold much water, and needs to be recharged often.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Just what I needed for the right price.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to us by our dentist. Does a fantastic job of cleaning out food from gum lines and between teeth. Took some getting used to, experienced a little bleeding at first but this stopped by the third use. Our dentist stated that this is normal. Has improved the health of our gums which resulted in better check ups!</li>
    <li> The waterpik was in a plain white box with a self stick label. Not a box you would see on a store shelf! The cord for the charger was zip-tied, not one of those twisty ties you normally get. Very strange, makes me think it was reconditioned and not new as claimed!</li>
    <li> The Cordless Waterpik Waterflosser is light enough when filled that it&#x27;s easy to handle, and changing the tip is a breeze. The battery holds a charge for several days so this Waterflosser travels well. Combined with my electric toothbrush, my mouth has never felt cleaner.</li>
    <li> I hate to floss. This makes that a none issue. Just a tip for those of you who think its a mess with all the water flying everywhere..... Toss a large bath towel over your head and shoulders to form a little tent. Lean over the sink and let it fly. Water on the mirror GONE!</li>
    <li> I thought I had a good product...works good and liked the results.  HOWEVER, it stopped working after less than 1 Year!  Really???? not worth the aggravation of having to buy another!  Thought &amp;#34;Waterpik&amp;#34; was a good brand not for me anymore!</li>
    <li> My old water pick died and I looked for a new one.  This model is slimmer than the old one which makes it easier to pack on trips.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, love my new waterpik.</li>
    <li> I have order the waterpick for alot of my family members. Works great. Came very quickly after I order it.</li>
    <li> I agree with everything another reviewer David Wilson says about this product, except I will not buy it a second time. It is hard to use and although the reservoir holds a certain amount of water it will not let all of it be used.  It has to be filled a second time or more to get all teeth rinsed.</li>
    <li> I have had no problem with the battery and I have had the unit for well over a year. In fact I am surprised sometimes that the battery lasts as long as it does between having to be recharged. It is very easy to fill up the unit, and it sits on my counter always ready to go. I feel no need to have to hide it anywhere. The only problem is that there is no adjustment for the pressure. Sometimes it will fluctuate a little due to the angle of the unit. But that does not present to much of a problem and I am well pleased with my water jet.</li>
    <li> High pressure tip broke while I changed to the low pressure tip in less than two weeks. &lt;br /&gt;Water Pik Pressure slowly declined to a complete stop in one month. &lt;br /&gt;I have called WaterPik twice, their answer system has failed to xfer my calls to customer service. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Comes with a one year warrranty and a 14 day money back guarantee! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep you updated until I receive a refund or replacement. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;IMHO, Amazon might consider to dump selling this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So far, a total waste of my time and my money! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am totally unhappy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe you should AVOID this item and thank me later.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d have believed the reviews I read here.....I was warned, but bought it anyway.  Although I liked the product, esp. the convenience since I travel for business, the battery actually melted the plastic casing and fried the whole thing within a month.  After numerous unanswered emails to WaterPik, they&#x27;ve now offered to send me their wp-60W counter top unit within 20 days of the return of the cordless unit.  I&#x27;m going to do that, however I really don&#x27;t want this larger model.  It&#x27;s interesting they didn&#x27;t offer to replace it in kind, clearly they have no faith in the hand-held model.  That&#x27;s probably a good reason NOT to purchase one.</li>
    <li> So much easier and less mess than the plug-in.  Pulse is not quite as strong but adequate.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the best-priced water-pik. Safe to use in all &#x27;water&#x27; &lt;br /&gt;situations because it doesn&#x27;t need to be plugged in. &lt;br /&gt;How many other things fall into the sink? Not all wiring &lt;br /&gt;is safe enough.</li>
    <li> Mine lasted 6 months, which seems middle of the road life expectancy from the reviews here.  I thought I&#x27;d stop using it, but its easy and convenient. I am much too lazy to floss, and my hygienist recommended it as the second best thing to flossing.</li>
    <li> This product is not reliable, I only used for seven months then it was not working any more.  There is no warranty.[[ASIN:B000M48GC8 Waterpik Oral Irrigator Cordless Handheld - WP360]]</li>
    <li> This is my second waterpik.  The first one broke after about 2 years of steady use.  It does the job though!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kinda hard to handle but good.</li>
    <li> I just wrote to waterpik.com to see if they will do anything about their 1 year warranty.  I bought this March 21, now it does not hold a charge.  We&#x27;ll see what the company does.  The cordless waterpik I had before this one, not the same model, did the same thing before a year was up.</li>
    <li> Contrary to other reviewers, mine has lasted for about 2 years.  Technically it&#x27;s still working but I&#x27;m going to have to buy something different. It only really worked well for the first two months, and then became rather weak.  No amount of charging brings back the power it initially had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for. My gums need top notch cleaning to stay healthy and this device just isn&#x27;t really doing it.  Plus, the well is so small I have to refill at LEAST twice... more like 4 times to attempt to do a good job.  I think I&#x27;m going to have to move up to the corded versions with the large tanks.</li>
    <li> It is great! At first its different but it dose work.I&#x27;m glad I got this my gums an teeth were very senseative and now with the pic its better.</li>
    <li> I have had 3 or 4 of these, sometimes replaced within the warranty BUT, either the connection quits or the battery is gone. I noticed that the warranty on the newest one is only one year instead of 2. I am not surprised as it quits working even though I keep it plugged in even when in use. Wouldn&#x27;t buy except I need it for travel, using the larger one at home.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed in Hawaii!</li>
    <li> I did not know what to expect since I had not used a water flosser before.  I chose this rating because I think it is a good buy for testing out how they work.  I probably will upgrade later on, but for now I can get accustomed to the routine of using the device. Had I not liked it, I would not have been out a great deal of money, so I think I made a good choise.</li>
    <li> I bought this one is for travel. It&#x27;s easy to take with and very happy with this purchase. It&#x27;s as efficient as the other one I used in home.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see so many bad reviews on this item. What do people expect for $30?  The item is fairly inexpensive and works great (while it works). I have just ordered my 3rd one. The first one lasted about 9 months, my second one made it an entire year and I honestly do not care if this one only lasts 6 months. It works great and if your only spending $30 you cannot expect it to last forever. If you are trying to find an everlasting product then I suggest spend some more money.</li>
    <li> It was great when it worked.  We have gone through two of these now.  I initially think I damaged it when I dropped it on the bathroom floor.  We purchased another one and the same thing happened - I knocked it off the bathroom counter and onto the floor and think it just doesn&#x27;t hold up well to getting knocked about. Neither one of them ever worked again:(</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit for traveling (I also have a full-size WaterPik) and it works just as I expected it to. My problem is the colored reservoir--I add Listerine or hydrogen peroxide to the water supply and the blue color is impossible to see through, even when holding it up to the light. So, there&#x27;s no way you could fill it only part way, then add the Listerine, because you can&#x27;t see what \\&quot;part way\\&quot; is. So, I would fill it full (the only way I was able to tell when it was full is when it spills over the top), and pour a little out to make room for Listerine. However, because the reservoir holds so little, I would inevitably end up pouring out more than I intended, fill it up again, pour some water out again..oh, heck, it was just a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you only use water, this product works just fine. Don&#x27;t be influenced by the bad reviews from people who expected the obviously tiny reservoir to hold a ton of water. You can tell by looking at the picture that it doesn&#x27;t and would need to be refilled during use.</li>
    <li> Husband uses it daily.  It is losing its power after 1 year, so I guess you have to buy another as the battery cannot be replaced.  That&#x27;s a bummer.</li>
    <li> Smaller so easier to handle, yet just the right amount of water stored.&lt;br /&gt;Power is perfect&lt;br /&gt;Perfect two picks included&lt;br /&gt;I have several Waterpik models, including countertop and another portable one.&lt;br /&gt;But this is my favorite so far!</li>
    <li> If I could give it a negative one star, I would.  This product is not ready for prime time.  They should not be selling it until it works right.  Mine died within the first 30 days.  Plus as is notated in other reviews, the ergonomics stink - you have to hold it a certain way for it to work (otherwise the water doesn&#x27;t empty), then the water comes out on your hand and the unit, the battery doesn&#x27;t last, the water pressure is too weak, I could go on and on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine for travel. Not  as strong as my original Waterpik but for the convenience I am satisfied. I took it on a cruise and extended vacation and will use it  for travel most gratefully.</li>
    <li> I have used battery powered water pics before but with this one all I have to do is just plug it in and recharge it and I always have a good strong water pressure.  Fills  and cleans easily .  It is a bit large for travel but if I don&#x27;t take it I always regret it .  Very satisfied with the product  I have beren using it for 3 months and no expensive batteries.</li>
    <li> I have to fill the reservoir three times to get through all my teeth. I understand later models hold more water. I recommend opting for one of those.</li>
    <li> this is my second purchase the first two lasted over 5 years ..love the product it works very well and i would recommend it</li>
    <li> Works very well.Easy to use.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT.  USE IT DAILY.</li>
    <li> I bought this flosser about 9 month ago.&lt;br /&gt;For around 7 month it was nice and works properly.&lt;br /&gt;Since 2 month ago the on/off button works when it wants and when it does, the motor fails.&lt;br /&gt;Another disposable product...</li>
    <li> I have had this item for nearly a year, but not quite long enough for the warranty to have yet expired.  When I first received it I was quite impressed.  Great power.  I have read a lot of complaints about the small size of the reservoir, but I have to tell you, I did not have an issue with that.  I was able to get all my squirting done in the prescribed time before running out of water.  I mean how long should it take, it can only squirt so deep, unless you have teeth the size of Mr ED, I don&#x27;t think it should be a problem.  Sounds like to me there may be a lot of overkill squirting going on.  Well enough of that, time to move on.  My issue was the battery.  In only a few months the battery died and I could not charge it.  I was bummed, because I really loved this product and it did a great job.  So I contacted Waterpik Customer Service and there was no hesitation, they sent me out another unit immediately.  What a great bunch of folks there.  The unit I received was not as good though. It had only about half the power of the first, which could be why everyone else was continually reloading the unit with a fresh dose of natures natural nectar.  I used the replacement one for about 4-5 months and just the other day I sent customer service another email advising them of my unhappiness with the second unit.  They have again immediately replied and offered an upgrade of a different unit.  I have not yet decided what to do yet, but I have to tell you Waterpik Customer Service has been outstanding thus far.  I guess I gave this item 2 stars because it just has not been dependable or efficient.  This is a shame because in the past I had a big home plug in unit that could drill a water hole through a molar in 10 seconds.  Not this unit though.  I will let you know what happens on this.</li>
    <li> This waterpik is a replacement of the one that I previously used.  The battery would not take a charge any longer.  I found out that I was running the battery all the way down and you are not supposed to do that.  It lasted 13 months by me doing that.  This time I will not let it run all the way down and will charge it for a few hours after about 5 uses.</li>
    <li> This WaterpikWaterflosser is the best for flossing your teeth . The water shoots out the flosser and clean what ever food particles that into the teeth.very refreshing and cleasing. I love the product .</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t even last 9 months.  I now have to replace it but will buy somewhere else that has longer than a 30 day warranty.</li>
    <li> **The pump breaks down because small particles of food end up in the reservoir and it clogs the pump.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the WP-360W for a few days now and I love it.  I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ve been going without it.  I recently got braces, so food is always stuck in the darn things.  I like that the WP-360W is portable.  I take it with me to work everyday and use it after each time I eat something.  I just finished eating a bunch of peanut M&amp;M&#x27;s, so I went to wash my mouth out with the Waterpik.  After I was done, I noticed chunks of peanut all over the top of the Waterpik.  I remembered seeing chunks of food the previous times I used it this week, but this morning, it dawned on me as to why some people were saying their pump quit working after a while.  The chunks of food were always almost going right into the reservoir as I was about to make another fill up.  IMO, it would be best to fill up the 2nd time, but drain the water out before use, so that in case any chunks did fall inside, you&#x27;ll be more than likely to get them out when you dump the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the problem people are having with the charger is that they are getting the adapter recepticle wet.  I noticed that the cover sometimes doesn&#x27;t close over the hole, or that I didn&#x27;t close it after taking the Waterpik off the charger.  Of course anyone that use this device will know that water goes all over the place, so naturally, water most likely dripped inside the adapter hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s quite unfair to give this product a 1 star.  IMO, this device is great and does an outstanding job for something that costs $21.99 (no tax and shipping charges, either).  $29.99 from the drug store might be a little much, but $21.99 is just right.  The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that this device didn&#x27;t cost much and if it was to break down after several uses, then it would be money well spent!  I&#x27;m quite sure there have been times that every person that bought this Waterpik had bought a pizza pie that cost more than this, however, that pizza was gone in an instant.  This Waterpik, although totally different in comparison with a pizza, is still a product, and like I said, if a person used this product several times over before it quit working, then why give it such a low score?  Things like this don&#x27;t last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Star rating!  Way to go Waterpik.  I love this product.an this, however, that pizza was gone in an instant.

    <li> I PURCHASED THIS ITEM IN 9-2013 AND IT BROKE IN DECEMBER 2013. I CALLED THE COMPANY AND THEY TOLD ME THAT I PURCHASED AN OLD ITEM AND IT IS NOT UNDER THEIR WARRANTY.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. I PURCHASED AN ITEM THAT WAS OLD</li>
    <li> My regular WaterPik was really good and recommended by my dentist.  It lasted for about two years and then sprung a major leak.  So I saw this version and thought, great!  Less counter space and it&#x27;s portable.      Every time I use it, the nozzle pops out while I&#x27;m cleaning, which sprays water all over and requires me to stop, refit the nozzle and then continue--for another few seconds until it pops out again.  By then, the chamber is empty and has to be refilled with water.  The regular WaterPik holds enough water to last for two minutes.  That&#x27;s about the amount of time needed to do a thorough cleaning.  This device runs out in about twenty to thirty seconds.  And the dial at the base of the nozzle, which you&#x27;re supposed to turn to direct the stream where you want it, tends to ensure that the nozzle pops out.      This is almost useless.  I&#x27;d like to find whoever designed it and send him or her for a check up with the dentist from Marathon Man.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant after reading other reviews, but I have owned this now for about three weeks and have no problems.  It holds a charge for about 10 days (so far, at least). The best part is that I use it in the shower with no problems. It does take filling it up twice to do my entire mouth, but that&#x27;s not an issue.  All in all, I am very satisfied for the price.</li>
    <li> This is so convenient and easy to use.  I had continual low-grade infection until it was discovered under my gums.  The Waterpik forces water into those areas that can&#x27;t be reached and cleans everything out.  My mouth feels so much better!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and had bought one for my mom. We had the old model of the Waterpik that had the tub on the top and had a plug. It always worked so well and made our teeth feel spotless. We both decided to try this Waterflosser because it seemed convenient and easy to use. However, there is not much pressure in this model and the reservoir is not very big. It does not do as good of a job at cleaning teeth/gums like the old model did. I would recommend getting the one that plugs into the wall and has a tub on the top.</li>
    <li> Bought this item Christmas of 2007. The water pik worked well until August 2008 when the battery would no longer hold a charge. The connector for the battery charger easily corrodes. The water tank is a little small have to refill tank. Item made in China.  Would not recommend this unit due to its very short battery life.</li>
    <li> i agree with other negative reviews...is just too cumbersome and not enough power to do the job..feels like you are putting something the size of a flashlight in your mouth..</li>
    <li> This is excellent for travel and takes the fuss and worry out of healthy teeth and gums while on the road.</li>
    <li> I have just finished with my 4TH Waterpik WP360W.  The first lasted 6 months, so we bought another one. The second lasted about the same, and this time I had it replaced by warranty (they are pretty good about that, at least).  The third one lasted about 7 months, again I returned it under warranty and they sent me another.  But I&#x27;ve finally had it as this one has lasted maybe 5 months.  Each time, the battery either refuses to continue to charge and you get a weak jet or the whole think just dies (sometimes I can get it started again by banging the base on the counter).  The idea of oral irrigation is great, I have much better dental appts since using it (my gum lines have lowered) and its great for a kid who doesn&#x27;t like to floss - my son uses it twice a day. But I will not buy a waterpik again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at walmart for less than $30.  Took it home and it worked great for 3 days.  Then stopped.  Immediatly returned it for a full refund. The product idea is great, but needs to go back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> Not worth the bucks. That 40-50 second run time before reservoir runs dry renders this item near useless. Should have read prior reviews.</li>
    <li> Waterpik is generally a reliable product what I as a little disappointed with this model</li>
    <li> This device gives adequate irrigation with the more restricted tip.  The more powerful tip is too strong and could pack food deeper in your gums [my dentist agrees]. Portability is it&#x27;s best feature and vital if you travel much. The small resevoir requires 2-3 fillings to do what one can with the larger sink top model, and it&#x27;s somewhat messier to use. For the price and portability, a good buy!</li>
    <li> I have gone through three of these in the last two years.  They functioned fine for a while but did not last.  Being handier than the average person, I managed to repair the 2nd two units several times but they ultimately failed.  The first unit burned out its motor after a few months and had to be trashed.  The 2nd and 3rd units worked on and off but eventually stripped their drive gears and could not be repaired.  I enjoyed the portability aspect but this product is a poorly engineered piece of crap.  Don&#x27;t waste your money - try another brand.</li>
    <li> Both my dentist and I love this flosser.  He is so very pleased I&#x27;ve been using it and can see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that it was a bit cracked in shipping which I was willing to live with, but it keeps chipping away and now the water container does not stay flat agains the main part of the flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should have sent it back, but my old one had died and didn&#x27;t want to be without one for even a day.</li>
    <li> I keep this at school (I&#x27;m a teacher) and it&#x27;s a great way to clean up after lunch and get ready for the last few classes&lt;br /&gt;without telling everyone what you had for lunch.</li>
    <li> Nowhere did it say this was a previously owned product.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy to own a personal care product previously owned.&lt;br /&gt;The return policy was not clear.  Seven days to return an item is not realistic when you travel for a living.  My mistake.</li>
    <li> this was rec&#x27;d exactly as shown on the site.  works great and the price was good.  love the brand and was happy to receive this in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Great product ... very fast delivery. Very good ....</li>
    <li> This was a good water pik and worked very well. But after only 6 or so months of use battery runs down faster and faster untill eventually it doesn&#x27;t even charge, so it was really a waste of money. I will try to get a different one possibly with batteries. I gave it two stars only because when it did work in the beginning it was very good and left your mouth feeling clean, though a bit tricky pouring the mouthwash into the  reservoir, and it is not bulky so was good for taking on a trip or weekend, but the battery very quickly started to run down so unless I got a bad one the battery life is extremely short, unfortunately with personal problems I wasn&#x27;t able to get to it before the one year warranty ran out,,,, so I am stuck having to pay for another type of waterflosser.If they could fix the battery problem it would be a good product. They should warn you that the battery runs out very quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a great little Waterpik.  I love the size and rechargeable battery.  It has lots of power for something so small.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Wateflosser does what it was advertised. Happy with results.</li>
    <li> This does not offer the high pressure jet the plug in machine gives you.  I like it because it offers the waterpik with out the machine sitting on your vanity.</li>
    <li> I used less than 10 times  when I was away home.  Today is exactly one year after I purchased.  It doesn&#x27;t turn on anymore.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this waterpik. It works well to remove tough particles of food. I have braces and this makes flossing obsolete. Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these several months ago and use it every other day or so and now it barely works.  After extensive recharging, when I filled it up and turned it on it chugged along with no pressure at all.  I emptied it out and turned it on again and it ran normal but as soon as I added water, it just chugged along with no pressure.  I would never recommend this brand.  Now I&#x27;ll have to find a replacement.</li>
    <li> Better than those annoying threads of floss, this gadget throws&lt;br /&gt;water at your defenseless teeth with the force of (house) pressure&lt;br /&gt;cleaning.  If it is there--- it will get it out !</li>
    <li> Leaks but out of warranty....figures!!</li>
    <li> Great product, highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It has plenty of power and don&#x27;t need to be charged for a decent amount of time.  It also is very easy to refill back up with water while being used and cleaning of teeth gums and under the bridge works well for flossing</li>
    <li> I have used this model waterflosser for a number of years. They usually last for a couple of years before battery will no longer hold charge. I except this a normal wear. My recent purchase lasted a little over a month and the battery will not charge. Of course I cannot not return. Maybe time to change brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I took the Waterflosser apart amd checked contact between charger and motor/pump, cleaned it up and now waterflosser works just fine. Not sure what the cause of failure was but, it works great so I needed to change my review.</li>
    <li> The water lasts only for top teeth, if you are lucky. The water leaks out the reservoir. The less pressure attachment is still to hard on the gums/teeth. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Runs out of water very fast.  Better to get the regular Waterpik.</li>
    <li> This will power even the toughest bugs out of your teeth. So hit the open road and grin all day knowning this waterpik will keep your smile clean and a fresh ear of corn.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cumbersome and I have to use 6x to clean teeth. I wanted it for travel. I love the regular Waterpik, but this was hard to handle and sloppy. I lost my receipt so I couldn&#x27;t return it! I would not recommend this chargeable/cordless appliance.</li>
    <li> I have found it to do the trick..I use a mixture of mouth wash and water to fill it. I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> This is my third Water Pik flosser.  The first lasted 2 years before it would no longer charge.  The second one, I dropped and the &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; was attached to the base and the pik part cracked and half of it was stuck in the base and could not be removed.  It was only 5 months old, my fault, so I didn&#x27;t notify the company.  What I did find out was that I had paid $60 for the original one at CVS and this exact same one is half the price on Amazon.  I would not have known that if I had not broken the other one.  Thank you Amazon for finding the best prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product as I have crowns, bridges and gum issues and since using the water pik, it only takes my dentist 5 minutes to clean my teeth.  Amazing!!  Flossing with brushing is NOT enough to get at everything between the teeth.  I floss first, water pik and then brush and my Dentist is very pleased,  I even add just a few drops of hydrogen peroxide to the water and that kills even more bacteria.  I use this twice a day and would never go without one.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband to use on trips.  He has one at home, and this is even better than the big one!</li>
    <li> It got in time.  It is a great flosser and I&#x27;m so happy with it. It is so incredibly good.</li>
    <li> This pick is at least twice as good as the previous one. The jet is stronger, and it&#x27;s also more quiet.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I need to finish my oral hygiene.  Easy to fill and easy to use.  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> does what it is supposed to. maybe a little bigger reservoir would be nice, but then maybe too clumsy to hold?</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter who just got braces. Ended up getting it a full day sooner than the delivery date! She absolutely loves it! She said it is extremely easy to use although it is a bit on the messy side!</li>
    <li> Does not stay charged. Plugging it in every other day.</li>
    <li> The product arrived early. Nice surprise to come home to</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I love the fact that it is a small unit and does not take up a lot of room on the counter.  I used to  have one of those big units and it was so huge  on the counter and if you keep it under the sink the chances of using a water pic every night  get slimmer by having ro haul it in and out.  I have had mine for over 4 years and I keep it plugged into the charger continuously.  It always keeps the charge this way.  I fill mine up with mouth wash and keep it filled.  I can use it 3 times before refilling.  My dentist has said, &amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know what you are doing, but keep it up&amp;#34;.  He is happy with the improved results every time he sees me!</li>
    <li> The first one I recieved did not work at all. Wouldn&#x27;t even turn on! After a series of communication, recieved another, and it is failing after a month.</li>
    <li> Love the convenience of this water flosser. It is easy to use and fill. It also travels well. I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I love this and have had it for several years and it is still working well. I have bought them for my family and they also like it.</li>
    <li> Awesome, great product excellent price, even my 10 yr old daughter can use it by herself, I recommend this for the whole family</li>
    <li> Excellent for people who wear braces.  When the braces came off my son&#x27;s teeth were pearly white.  An amazing product.</li>
    <li> These last about two years. I would buy another when this konks out. Great styling to have on countertop. Does the job too.</li>
    <li> We ordered two (for 2 residences) and they both expired in a month.  Replacement batteries&lt;br /&gt;are not available,  Cordless variety is a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Hoped the cordless would be better than the big model but just as messy. My dentist keeps recommending waterpik but I don&#x27;t like the sensation or mess.</li>
    <li> I am on my second unit in 9 months.  Both units stopped charging after about 3 months.  I tried to reset it like the help desk recommended...no luck.  I liked the compact nature of the unit and when it worked...it worked well.  I will save the $120/year cost in replacement units and try a different brand.</li>
    <li> This is a common complaint...short battery life.  Otherwise, I was satisfied with the product.  If Waterpik is going to design a device whose battery only lasts a year, they should make it with a replaceable battery.</li>
    <li> Heathy gums - my dentist liked my choice and gave me a thumbs up on my last check up - so I give Waterpik a big thumbs up as well!</li>
    <li> This works very well!  I had one previously &amp; was glad to buy this one. It gets a lot of fruitful use.  Merry Christmas!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about this before i really purchased it! But when i got it, i told myself, i should write a review about this waterflosser too. It is very convenient to use! Hassle free! And very reliable! I can maintain freshness and clean mouth because of continues flossing! This flosser help me a lot! My dentist told me that im doing great with my home flossing! I can say that because of the hassle free flossing, i can now achieve optimum dental hygiene! It is not expensive and it&#x27;s lightweight that i can use it even while taking shower..ahaha...but overall,this is worth a try for everyone! U r not gonna regret buying this stuff from amazon!</li>
    <li> This does drip and the reserve doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I got it as a back-up to floss, and to make it easier than setting up the old one, for that reason, it is just what I needed.  It is simple to use and it right there ready to go at all times.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended highly .  All of the dept stores were quite expensive. And I now enjoy flossing each day.</li>
    <li> This is my second of this same model and both leak and are messy to use.</li>
    <li> Yes, just like the many others my waterpik will not hold  a charge after owning it less than a year.  I thought that it was something that I did wrong.  Fortunately for me I read the reviews. This malfuction seems to be a major problem with this product. I was very disspointed to learn that besides myself there are other people experiencing the same problem.  Waterpik needs to reimburse their customers for garbage being sold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of those devices.  One 3 years ago and 2 in the last months (I wanted to give it another chance).  They hold only a couple of weeks.  All 3 stopped recharging after very few time (3 to 5 weeks).  I don&#x27;t understand that a company like Waterpik doesn&#x27;t do anything about it.</li>
    <li> Bulky, holds very little water,head spins and it is hard to direct where you want it.  too big and too small...they may get it right, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Water pik brand is wonderful. I had my first one for 30+ years and just had to replace it because the plastic cracked and might harbor bacteria. Replacement has a small footprint and two different heads for variation in strength. I brush and floss and use this to prevent gingivitis. Works great accoding to my dentist. [[ASIN:B0002AHY6Q Waterpik WP-360W Hand-held Cordless Rechargeable Dental Water Jet]]</li>
    <li> I chose this model for its small counter footprint compared with the previous devices I have owned.  It has the advantage of not using a flexible tube to connect the pump to the hand peice, which tends to collect mold, and is nearly impossible to clean.    The water tank is small, but it is easily filled and refilled using a glass of lukewarm water, rather than directly from the tap, as it doesn&#x27;t fit under my bathroom sink faucet.     Battery charge has not been a problem, but I recommend recharging after every two or three uses, to insure long battery life. Operating the unit until the battery is fully discharged before recharging will cause early battery failure, and it is not replaceable. The size and battery power make it suitable for travel.    Jet pressure is only adjustable by changing tips.  This is satisfactory, but an adjustable pressure control would be a significant improvement.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik WP-360W is a great device!  It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, that was a prerequisite for me.  I charge it up once a week.   The 30 seconds is enough for me.  Hope my next visit with the hygienist shows improvement.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel and it was a waste of money.  It does not have any power and I should have just flossed.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and meets all of my expectations as far as performance, as well.</li>
    <li> The model I got was used.&lt;br /&gt;i did not like it.&lt;br /&gt;It was very dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the bigger model.</li>
    <li> I love my waterpik! I use it daily and it helps with removing food stuck between teeth &amp; flossing. It&#x27;s very strong. I have 3 different waterpik models, this being one of them. The nice part about this one is it&#x27;s good for travel, holds an excellent charge! I charge mine only every 2 months typically.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is that 2 days ago I found that mold grew inside the very bottom of the water reservoir - gross! The reservoir is very deep with only a very small opening at the top - making my job at cleaning it verrrrryy difficult. I put vinegar in it, then bleach and water mixture, I got a lot of the gunk out but then used a long disposable chopstick to scrape the bottom very clean, then did a thorough bleach &amp; water mixture, followed by vinegar again and several water rinses. I wish a warning was included in the instructions so that I would look for mold sooner and do weekly cleans to prevent it, which I will now being doing. Plus it would be nice to have another opening to access the bottom to clean it well.&lt;br /&gt;Also pull the blue reservoir away from the white motorized base and wipe it clean from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;All in all - this tool is invaluable if you hate flossing and want to keep cavities from growing between your teeth. Definitely a worthwhile purchase !!!! I have recommended it to many family and friends which have purchased it with wonderful results.</li>
    <li> When this item is working, I would give it 5 stars. Unfortunately I have had to replace it 3 times and this latest one isn&#x27;t working right and I&#x27;ve only had it a couple months. The others have lasted a year and a half or so.</li>
    <li> so far so good hope it lasts longer then the conair one I bought a couple of years ago</li>
    <li> We had been dealing with the old ones for quite a while and just love the ease of use on the new portable model.....THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the deal.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Waterpik devices for 10 years, mainly the plug in AC models. Nothing beats them for capacity. But three years ago I had to have braces put back on and wore retainers all day all night. I needed the portable to take on road trips and to keep one at work. I bought three in total. Work, one for home (retired the A/C unit that sat on the bathroom sink) and gave my little brother one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It works pretty much just like the big boy. WHEN it is charged freshly, and that means you get about 3 uses before it runs dead and needs a recharge, it is very effective. It is a little cumbersome to reach in the back while leaning over the sink at work with people watching you, but you get over it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The battery packs in all three died after 6-8 months. I took one back to Walmart (only two came from Amazon) and that got me through until the end of my braces...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth: For the money, and unless you travel and need it on the road or wear braces and need to floss after meals at work, you are better off getting the A/C model, as my last one is 6 years old and still going strong. I spent roughly $140.00 on all three, and they are now recycling themselves in some landfill. A removable, replaceable battery pack would be a bonus.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of a cordless water flosser. Some of the reviews say that it didn&#x27;t hold a charge, but I had no issues with that. It&#x27;s small enough to travel with and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in the beginning stages of gum disease and was going to need them scraped at my next visit. My dentist suggested a waterpik in addition to brushing and flossing twice a day. Not only did my gums heal, but I had zero cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only rated this with three stars because I had one and the lid broke, which was not replaceable. I bought a second one and accidentally dropped it, and the tip broke off and the part that remained in the waterpik would not come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I will either get a different brand or a different model.</li>
    <li> very good for a water pic, portable and easy to use and pack in an overnight bag. Would buy again or as a gift.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement unit for my wife&#x27;s unit whose battery had gone kerflunk. It is used by her alone and she hasn&#x27;t complained so I have to assume it met her expectations.</li>
    <li> This is the second one that I owned - the first one would not hold a charge (for long); and this second one runs and runs and runs but does not pump.  What a waste . . . . use it on trips as I have an effective/reliable countertop Waterpik / flosser.  That one works fine.  This one, the portable: forget-a-&#x27;bout-it!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a similar model that just died after a year.  Up to then it worked well. I thought this new model would work better.  It lasted about 2 weeks before it died.  It seems the switch does not work because it will go on for a second or two - but now not at all.  It also has the same problems other reviewers have expressed.  I will be contacting customer service for a refund.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> The hose attachment on my corded WaterPik Ultra Water Flosser (Model WP-100) broke recently so while waiting for a replacement part in the mail I bought this unit as a stand-in. As other people have commented, among the main drawbacks is the smaller water reservoir than the standard corded style Waterpik. In order to fully clean my mouth I have to fill the reservoir twice. I am an educator and if I were assigning a grade to this product I would give it a &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; which qualifies as satisfactory or, using the Amazon stars rating, 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, once I have my old Waterpik up and running again with the new hose attachment I plan on taking the cordless one to my beach condo where space is limited. The small footprint will work well with the limited counter space at the condo, so overall not a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> This will be useful for those occasional road trips, although I need to refill it twice in order to complete the cleaning of my whole mouth.  IT WORKS as advertised.</li>
    <li> The only way to change pressure is to switch tips, which I could tell no difference.&lt;br /&gt;Both violated my mouth, way too much pressure, had no control at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am returning, It is very loud too.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is no light to show when it is fully charged or even charging at all.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at Walmart, for same prices as Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;Now looking for something else.</li>
    <li> I like this because it is powerful. I bought the kind that comes with the big green/blue plastic water reservoir and it was so weak that it did nothing. It was a joke really ...actually it&#x27;s good for tonsils if you have them. Because this cordless one is so strong it made my tonsils bleed. But it works very well on my teeth. I use it in the shower have not had any battery issues. I even bought a back up one in case it conks out.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does very good job you feel that your teeth was clean enough and the brush reach parts impossible with the regular brush.</li>
    <li> All i can say is that this product is really good but the only thing that really sucks about it is the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.  After a few months used the charger just died and couldn&#x27;t use it anymore.  I have owned 2 of this and the same problem, charging battery doesn;&#x27;t last. Even if you&#x27;re not over charging it.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t hold enough water.  hard to fill.  works fine but not as well as original sink side waterpik.  holds charge well</li>
    <li> Messy to use. I guess I&#x27;ll know if it was a the right purchase when I see my hygienist is a few months.</li>
    <li> I tried both speeds on the Waterpik. The lower speed was too weak and felt ineffective on my teeth. The higher speed feels better&lt;br /&gt;but after a week, my gums no longer felt the cleansing effect. I guess my next dental visit will prove it&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water container does not hold enough water and shoots out so fast, I must fill 2 or 3 times to properly clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> I just tossed out my flosser after almost a year of use. Worked great. Unlike other folks here, I made sure to plug it right back in after I was done using it, so it held its charge without going out on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just need to make sure to clean this unit out on a regular basis - which I failed to do, since it ended up turning into a &amp;#34;mold factory&amp;#34;. I even took out the two screws on the bottom and pulled it apart to clean it out and it was beyond hope - disgusting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So suffice to say, I&#x27;ll be buying a brand new one here soon, and just need to remember to clean it out on a constant basis!</li>
    <li> I have gum issues, periodontis, and this keeps my gums healthy.  Better than flossing. Especially if you have crowns and other dental work.</li>
    <li> Hate it! If you turn wrong way whhich would be normal to use product it stops working. Not a fan</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I liked the self contained reservoir however after a short period of time it will not hold a charge anymore.</li>
    <li> My other one just wore out which I guess is expected.  this one can be cleaned which is great.  that way I can keep it longer.</li>
    <li> after less than 1 year it doesn&#x27;t work anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oops, my husband had unplugged, so i was not recharging it&lt;br /&gt;now as plugged in, it works again</li>
    <li> Like the unit, it works well. Wish the water tank was a little larger. Other people complained about the head swiveling at will making it difficult to aim. I found an easy fix by just rapping a rubber band tight at the base of the swivel</li>
    <li> Whatever was wrong with a BATTERY-POWERED * * * NON RECHARGEABLE  irrigator? I had one of these for years and loved it. I don&#x27;t like to have a zillion things plugged in on my bathroom counter. In the first place, there aren&#x27;t enough outlets for the irrigator, the toothbrush, the hair drier, the curling iron, the shaver, etc. ad infinitum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING I CAN PUT 3 OR 4 AA BATTERIES IN  *  *  *  P-L-E-A-S-E * * * ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> I have only used Waterpik because it was the brand recommended by my dentist. I have been using them for the last 7-8 years.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing after flossing and brushing the Waterpik still finds food lodged between the teeth. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have tried waterpik&#x27;s in the past and just hated using it, but dentist suggestion that I get over that and try again.  I love this cordless waterpik waterflosser and hope to see an improvement in my next dentist visit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a water pik before and I only bought this because I hated flossing everyday when I had braces. I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed or disappointed.</li>
    <li> It is great with lots of power.  I have bought this item twice in Walmart over the years.  Always had to charge frequently.  Have not had to charge it since I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Battery last a long time good product</li>
    <li> Since using this product, I have had great dental checkups.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Mom and she was thrilled it came so quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I expected. The pressure on the tip is almost non-existent but I suppose it&#x27;s better than not using one. It is also a bit bulky, as a frequent and light traveler the less bulky the better.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this! It&#x27;s easy to operate, cleans my teeth so well, dentist praises my oral hygiene. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> After having a regular water pik, this portable one falls, short .  It isn&#x27;t as powerful and the reservoir isn&#x27;t big enough, I have to fill it twice for each use.  And it&#x27;s messy;  the water dribbles down my arm into the sink.  I should have gotten the regular plug in.</li>
    <li> Works well except that it&#x27;s harder to fill with water, because of it&#x27;s length, than my older one. The older one filled from an opening on the bottom front while this new one fills from a port at the top end. The bottom of the unit hits the bottom of the bathroom lavatory  leaving no room to get the top directly under the faucet. It&#x27;s not really a big deal. One just makes adjustments.  :)</li>
    <li> No good.  Have had it about 2 weeks, will no longer charge.  Even at strongest pressure, inadequate.  Will try to return it, but with new rules from Amazon, not sure they&#x27;ll let me</li>
    <li> I bought the Cordless Plus Water Flosser thinking that I would use it for travel as stated on the Waterpik website.  Come to find out it is completely impractical for that purpose.  There is no way to dry out the reservoir easily nor clean it if it gets lime deposits in it and I am worried about it mildewing.  When I travel, it takes up too much room and I have to keep it in a plastic storage bag because of the water left in the reservoir which I cannot completely drain out and there is no place to store the tip.  When I get home it has to sit on the bathroom counter for over a week with the flap open in hopes that it will dry out.  Truly ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a replacement of a Panasonic Portable Oral Irrigator as it comes apart for cleaning/drying, is significantly smaller and unlike this one has a place to store the tip.  My boyfriend has the Panasonic and thinking that the Waterpik might be better ordered it.  Once he saw mine he decided he will return it upon receipt (too big), now I am ordering his.  Waterpik should either rethink the product or remove the recommendation for travel from their website/literature.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about two years ago.  It started experiencing &amp;#34;battery bounce&amp;#34; about six months ago (1.5 years after purchase).  Now it has totally died, and will not accept charge...useless! Do not purchase this product I would invest in a pricier, but higher quality Philips Model.</li>
    <li> so far having it more then 2 years really cleans well and remove particles that floss wire can&#x27;t. The reason i am taking off 2 stars is the charging port. The way it is designed it collect and holds water there and this causes corrosion. Well then even if you wipe it the you will face another problem like the male charging plug gets loose with the time  which prevents device from charging due poor connection, while you expect to have it ready to clean your mouth.</li>
    <li> This is meeting my need. I like that it is easy to travel with me. Some people said they had problems with the rechargeable battery but I have not found this to be a problem so far.</li>
    <li> I use the water to wash stuff from between my teeth and gums.  I have tyo refill twice per washing but it works fine and does the job.  I have one in each bathroom but the big one in the main bathroom is the one I really like to use.  It contains a cup of water and the flexible tube makes it real nice.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  Some of the reviews stated it was hard to use but I have not found that to be the case.  I really like it and find it easy to use.</li>
    <li> Ok for traveling, but cumbersome and messy. Not as forceful as regular model. Won&#x27;t be my everyday water pik flosser</li>
    <li> works good but you have use 2 times due it not being able to hold alot water other than that i like this product</li>
    <li> The water pressure, even with the lower pressure attachment, is too high to be comfortable, and has the side effect of running through the water so fast that I had to add water before I could finish.</li>
    <li> This was on a close out sale and since a waterpik was recommended by my dentist I bought it. Worthless product. Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge at all. Always shorting out the outlet. The strength of the pulses did not last more than 2 months. Forget about it...</li>
    <li> They needed to make it so it separates from the charger.  Too heavy to&lt;br /&gt;Pick up and hold in mouth with handle attached to base</li>
    <li> I think that this appliance is great....when it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the reservoir is small but this didn&#x27;t bother me as I used it in the shower and refilled from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what DOES bother me is the fact that when it arrived it was charged up and ready to go and I used it continuously for about 3 weeks before the charge ran out and now when I try to recharge it won&#x27;t hold the charge. It lasts about 20 seconds before grinding to a halt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really unhappy about this. I expected much more. I am about to return it but don&#x27;t like my chances of getting my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy as much as I can through Amazon but I bought my Waterpik from Ebay as the Amazon seller doesn&#x27;t post to Australia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these products - the 1st one was about 6 years ago from CVS pharmacy and it worked like a charm, the battery was great. In 2010 I bought 2 additional cordless 450 models for the other family memebrs. The batteries of the 2 items is a very bad and non lasting- it barely last 45 sec and has to be charged every time. I still gave another chance and bought a 4th item in 2011 but the same rip off. Because of my purchase in 2007 which was good and then all the other 3 were terrible on the batttery side I can conclue that somehow the company started a huge shortcut and uses a very low quality batteries. I need to buy another item for water flossing but will never go back to watepik. Sorry I gave them many chances!!!</li>
    <li> This unit is kinda big and its hard to keep it in the bathroom. I guess it works as it should but I was surprised it di not have more water pressure</li>
    <li> Messy messy messy. Sprays water everywhere. This was recommended by my dentist so I bought it. I use it occasionally instead of daily simply because of the mess.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I  start using a waterflosser some time ago, but I kept putting off getting one until after my last dentist visit when he told me it was a necessary move since I have so much bridgework.  So I bought this one because of the familiar name and I find it has made a world of difference in how clean my mouth feels.  I am so glad I finally listened to him.  I have been very pleased with the performance of this product, find that it holds a charge much longer than I expected.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> in that it is cordless and more travel worthy.  Wish it held more water than my old corded tank Waterpik but guess it is a fair trade-off.  Much better than flossing with floss and better as it doesn&#x27;t cut gums.</li>
    <li> I love it  was recommended by my dentist hygienist and dentist. Would buy it again. Like it alot. Good price.</li>
    <li> It worked great for 3 months, until it one day stopped recharging.  My dentist charged $90 (!!) for it.  I could&#x27;ve gotten a better deal on amazon, but it still would&#x27;ve been a waste of money for a product that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I think it does a good job. I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t get one with a larger reservoir. I have to fill it quite often.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son because he has teeth implants.  It works great to get the mouth clean behind the teeth.  Works great.  Cleans well between the teeth too.</li>
    <li> I love this so much better than flossing. I feel like it&#x27;s more thorough, as well.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for the same one, only less expensive. Works great.</li>
    <li> Poorly designed.  Even on &amp;#34;High&amp;#34; it does not have much pressure.  Does not hold a charge.  A waste of money!</li>
    <li> Received quickly and love it.</li>
    <li> So good I bought another.</li>
    <li> This is the second cordless water pik I purchased. The 1st one worked well but stopped working after 7 months. I purchased a second one and now 9 months later it no longer works. I made sure that the unit was properly charged per the instuctions provided. When the 2nd one crapped out I took the unit apart and found the unit was full of condensation. I will NEVER buy another one of these!</li>
    <li> I liked using Waterpik until it totally wouldn&#x27;t charge after 6 months use.  The strong water pulses seem like a good idea, but there is still no substitute for regular floss that can reach more areas and is less messy.</li>
    <li> Waterpik makes very quality products but this one is not for us. The water pressure is not adjustable and set so high it can actually hurt. The water volume is so great you need to refill 2-3 times to really get to all your teeth inside and out. Because of it&#x27;s size and reservoir attached, you cannot tilt it correctly when water is below full for hard to reach places.  Just not a User friendly device and definitely not one we want to keep.  The variable units at higher prices are much better for getting the job done.  They are just less portable.</li>
    <li> Does a great job and is easy to use.  This was suggested by my dentist to keep my teeth clean between check ups.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these 6 months ago, the first one lasted one charge before I sent it back to waterpik under warrany!    I have just come to use the waterpik in the last week and this one is dead as well. I think I&#x27;ll just keep sending back under warranty until my 1 years warranty expires.    Shame really because when it does work I quite like it.</li>
    <li> It really removes the plaque from around your teeth and your teeth look almost as good as when you are just leaving the dentist. Im not one to ever go on Amazon and rate products, but this one really really does work! I love it!</li>
    <li> For $25 it is a good product. I&#x27;m going to give this product the benefit of the doubt. To the people that say it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water, the package says that it holds 30 seconds worth of continuous spray. If this isn&#x27;t enough it is easy to refill, or go with a larger model (more $$$ and counter space) Also, there are many complaints about the battery. I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to comment on the life of the battery but if you FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. One reviewer said they let the battery die completely to avoid it developing a memory, and that is what you should do with most rechargeable batteries. BUT the directions specifically say NOT to let the battery drain all the way on this model. Overall it is a good oral irrigator for its low price, and size. If you are unsatisfied with it take advantage of the warranty :)</li>
    <li> The price was very good at $23.00, but there&#x27;s a crack in the plug holder.  So far the functionality has not been affected.  this may be an outdated model, since i couldn&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!!! Recommended 100%!!!</li>
    <li> The product was pretty much what I expected. The company That I purchased it from was excellent. The one I have is a replacement. The original was delivered missing a rubber seal from the factory. I called the distributor of the device and he literally put a replacement in the mail while I was on the phone. He was even going to send it over night for Saturday delivery, but I told him it was not necessary. I&#x27;ve only had the device a couple weeks. It works well so far.</li>
    <li> it is easy to use.  This one is inexpensive and does the work.  Great for travel becasue it is compact.</li>
    <li> HAD TO SEND ONE BACK IT JUST STOPPED WORKING. AMAZON REPLACE IT QUICKLY AT NO CHARGE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY MUST WEAR OUT QUICKLY. THE BATTERY CHARGE DOES NOT LAST LIKE MY ELECTRIC TOOTH BRUSH. MAYBE IT IS THE PUMP. HARD TO TRAVEL WITH.</li>
    <li> This waterflosser would be perfect if not for its size.  I&#x27;d redesign this to be shorter with a bigger water chamber.  It could be easier to hold.  I use mine every night and charge about once every 7 days.</li>
    <li> this works very well and holds enough water to complete objective</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail yesterday and it is exactly what I needed for myself and my 12 year old daughter. She was so excited to use it. If it gets her to \\&quot;floss\\&quot; I&#x27;m all for it. Better than nothing. Great for the price. Not sure about the battery because I just got it but we will see. But for now we love it and especially for the price..</li>
    <li> I was disappointed...I own the waterpik 900,loved it but needed a travel one....I bought this cordless, and the only good thing about it, is that it&#x27;s portable...You have to refill it too often to clean your whole mouth and it&#x27;s very messy...</li>
    <li> Does exactly as described. Works very well for cleaning braces.  The charge last a long time.  Used at least once a day since we bought it and haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet.  14 days or so.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great waterpik! I am a dental hygienist and this is a great one to get! The one I received in the mail actually was a faulty one, but I contacted waterpik and they replaced it for me!</li>
    <li> I purchased this waterpik @ Walmart and it lasted exactly 2 weeks. I called customer service @ waterpik and they were no help at all.  It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have not used this unit yet.  Bought it as a back up.  The one in use has lasted 18 months of daily use, but is becoming slower.  Due to use of the &#x27;Waterflosser&#x27;, my dentist told me my gums were much healthier and signs of gingivitis were gone.  Hey, I&#x27;m 70 !  If this tool helps me keep my teeth, it is well worth the price.  [Original unit still working well after 30 months.  Good product. (6/&#x27;15)]</li>
    <li> Handy and easy to use. Great product!</li>
    <li> After reading a few reviews, I&#x27;m amazed that mine lasted for 5 1/2 years with no problems. I was able to clean my teeth with just one filling of the water reservoir (unless I ate red meat or something like that). It held the charge for a good amount of time before I needed to plug it back in and when the pressure started to weaken, I knew it was time to recharge. I wasn&#x27;t careful about drying it off so mine had hard water deposits. It just recently wouldn&#x27;t turn on so I plugged it in. After an overnight charge, I tried it again. Still nothing. I came to Amazon to price a new one but now I&#x27;m nervous that I&#x27;ll end up with a bad unit like so many others.</li>
    <li> A Water Pick was recommended by dentist and I like mine well enough to send it to all my children.</li>
    <li> Bought a second one and took a chance. Lasted the same as the first one, less than a year. Then the charge won&#x27;t hold and it barely pushes out any water. Buy something else. The last two I had ended up in the dumpster.</li>
    <li> Good product especially for use with braces.</li>
    <li> very pleased to item would recommend it</li>
    <li> Very happy with this. Have some deep pockets and this helps keep my gums healthy.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, will stay charged for up to a week without being recharged. Very convenient to take with you on short trips.</li>
    <li> Nice that it is cordless and rechargeable! The blue tip in ours snapped and broke while inserting in and it does leak just a tiny bit but as long as used over the sink its good!</li>
    <li> I bought this at a retail store near me for about 30 bucks after tax. I really did like it at first, and I&#x27;d have given it four stars if I&#x27;d have gotten around to reviewing it during that first week or so. Now, about three or four months later, it just stopped working. I fully expect any device I buy to last longer than that, so I can&#x27;t give it any more than two stars. I&#x27;m not giving it one star, because it was my first dental irrigator, and the experience was positive enough that I&#x27;m going to buy another. But not another one by this manufacturer, I&#x27;m looking for something now that&#x27;ll last more than a few months.</li>
    <li> I like it very much, this is more than expected, I´m considering buying more advanced version, I received a grear item</li>
    <li> I have been using this model for the past year to supplement my flossing.  This past visit to the dentist my hygienist told me that there was not plaque on my teeth.  My gums no longer bleed.  It is the older model...and it works great and is less expensive then the newer versions out there.  I am on my second one, as the first stopped pumping after 6 months of daily use.  Sometimes the chamber can get yellow mildew or algae (we have it in out well water) so I have eliminated this problem by throwing a capful of mouthwash into it and letting it sit overnight.  I also remove the pick portion nightly and prop the unit upside down to drain well.  This process is working well for me.  I liked this so much I got one for my son as well.</li>
    <li> I have had a Waterpick Waterflosser for half year now and am very happy with it. I have gum problems and decided to give it a try - the price is really affordable. Since then I have been twice to my periodontist for regular treatments and he finds my gums very healthy. The same with the hygienist, last time she told me: \\&quot;Whatever you do, keep doing it.\\&quot; I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the battery, as some reviewers complain. By the way, bought one for my wife too, and she likes it a lot. I definitely recommend Waterpick, especially if you have gum problems; it works as it says.</li>
    <li> After buying this identical pik at Walmart for $40, I was stunned to see it at Amazon for $29.  I grabbed one for my son.&lt;br /&gt;This Waterpik does a great job. Don&#x27;t need to use dental floss after this.  It removes debris from all crevices.</li>
    <li> A replacement. I was glad that I didn&#x27;t have to buy this from the stores. Even the box stores did not beat your price, including S&amp;H.</li>
    <li> We have the regular water piks but for traveling this fits the bill. It is small enough to fit in a suitcase but gives you 30 seconds of penetrated water spray.</li>
    <li> a great waterpik because my husband is handicapped its easy for him to use i n the shower</li>
    <li> This works and works well but has a short shelf life.  It lasted barely a year.  I had used the table top version before and it lasted several years.  I thought I&#x27;d try this because of the smaller form factor.  This seems to have been a mistake.  I&#x27;m going back to table top model since they last longer for the same price.</li>
    <li> I gave it as a gift but was told it worked well and could be taken to work when needed.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, great teeth cleaning.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the model but it stopped working after only one year.</li>
    <li> Very strange item. Does not produce as much pressure as the traditional Waterpik. The reservoir needs to be refilled several times during use and as the water level decreases so does the pressure. As you tilt the device the water level shifts so the pressure is constantly going in and out. Pass on this one until they get it right.</li>
    <li> great item, as described</li>
    <li> While the WP-360W worked well for a few weeks, it stopped holding a charge for more than a day or two after about a month. Attempts to contact the company by e-mail were stalled because they insist you take the water pik apart to find the serial number, and who has time for that? The on-off switch is tricky as well and can slip &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; while the product is charging. If that happens, you will have wasted your time as the battery runs down completely -- so you have to start over again. All in all, I would say, don&#x27;t buy this waterpik!</li>
    <li> Use it every day.  Works well.  Actually see bits of food coming out. Makes flossing a lot more bearable, I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for the past 4 months.</li>
    <li> Very useful and efficient. I love how much time I save flossing compared to regular flossing. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to regular flossing even after braces</li>
    <li> Everyone should use this toothbrush, it cleans my teeth much much better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is a very poor product.  As one other reviewer posted, it worked great for a while but the battery would progressively hold less and less of a charge.  Like other posters, I made sure I was discharging all the way and that no other corrosion or anything else was happening.  I bought two before I realized that it was just a poorly designed product, but I see Waterpik is still selling them!  Save yourself some money and get one of their normal sized units.  Those actually work pretty well.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS WATERFLOSSER.  Great and simple to charge, holds a good amount of water so you can definitely give a couple passees through the whole mouth per each flossing.  The pulse is strong but comfortable.  Would buy another one for sure.</li>
    <li> more powerful than any other portable water pik i have owned--stays charged for 2-3 weeks without recharging-great for vacations and travel--easy to use, easy to refill</li>
    <li> The product did a decent job of cleaning. The non-portable unit really did work much better, but this one was portable. Stopped taking charge and dropped dead. They should sell this as a disposable product for a disposable price. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product works for about 3 months and then it&#x27;s a waste. It will not recharge properly, not as powerful as it was initially. For a thorough job, stick with the counter-top electric model.</li>
    <li> This is my second cordless waterpik; it can easily travel with me anywhere. I use it 1-2 times daily; and it has helped with dental care.</li>
    <li> Lasted about a year, then just died.  So on it&#x27;s way to the land fill to poison mother earth, gift from the Chinese.  Shame on you Waterpik for making the ultimate anti-green device.  Guaranteed to fail, no replacement parts, poor engineering, testiment to Chinese greed.  Will I buy another one, no.  Tried of cheap junk that only lasts a short while.  The reviews on here are true, these fail like wet or old fireworks.  Good luck if you get a bang.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find a replacement for my old Waterpik. Amazon really&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;filled the bill&amp;#34; and once again I can take good care of my teeth.</li>
    <li> This product is the best ever!  My daughter recently got braces and she loves this portable waterpik.  She can take it with her anywhere!</li>
    <li> I really like this item. It does what it is supposed to do—help rinse mouth out before brushing. This product should be used in addition to regular flossing, and not take the place of flossing. It does splatter sometimes if I hold it the wrong way, but otherwise a really good purchase.</li>
    <li> It is just ok not the waterpik I thought it would be.  The plunge is coming apart and because I don&#x27;t have the box any more I guess that is my problem now.</li>
    <li> The only fault I have with this item is the size of it&#x27;s reservoir. Good pressure and does a fine job, but runs out of fluid too quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought few of them. Work great, but does not last. Customer service is excellent, sent replacement right of way. I would recommend this product to my friends</li>
    <li> This is a good buy.  I use it every other day and works well.  Better Dental checkup too and good price for what you get :-)</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. It reaches all the right spots in my mouth. I would like it to last longer because I have to refill the handle 3 times so I can feel satisfied with the cleaning.But it does a good floss of my teeth.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik Waterflosser does a way better job than flossing.  And, it&#x27;s easier!  HIGHLY recommend.!  (I&#x27;ve gone through a few of these - the motor doesn&#x27;t last forever)</li>
    <li> I have the larger UltraFlosser (WP-105W)for use at home. I bought this WP-360W for travel and find that it works very nicely. Has a good amount of power.</li>
    <li> Is everything I expected.</li>
    <li> Defective product. Water leaks at the bottom. Didnt get to use it at all. Not sure if i can return it coz of my location. I stay in Lagos,  Nigeria.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I had owned two of the previous models that suffered bad connection for recharging.  This model had heard their customers and fixed the problem.  Better teeth at my next appt.  no doubt will reward me.</li>
    <li> The product works well, and ours actually lasted for several years.  Only the battery failed on us.&lt;br /&gt;* After 5 years, our drive gear shows very little wear, only the faintest hint of darkening of the silicone grease.&lt;br /&gt;* The little power brick is rated 100ma, 3V, but I found it to be 3.7V.  I didn&#x27;t verify BEFORE it failed; however, it&#x27;s a transformer, rectifier, and a filter cap.  If something failed internally, I&#x27;d expect ripple to go up, or voltage to go down, or squealing from a transformer short.  None of that seems to have happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way to keep the battery alive for so long is to NOT keep it plugged in.  The \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot; of NiCd batteries can be at play; however, you can \\&quot;recondition\\&quot; them by using them down to where the motor stops, then immediately recharging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s a NiCd battery pack, you must NOT leave this on the charger.  You want to charge it up for (overnight) and then leave it unplugged.  Use it until it doesn&#x27;t have the power to clean anymore, then recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a smart device -- there is no trickle charge, nor battery conditioner.  Overcharging a NiCd causes venting of hydrogen and oxygen from the breakdown of the water in its electrolyte.  It&#x27;s a one-way valve.  Once the battery is dried out, that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t leave it \\&quot;on\\&quot; with the battery dead.  Because this has 2 cells in series, one cell will always be slightly lower power than the other.  Once it goes below 2V, the weaker of the 2 cells will reverse polarity.  If it&#x27;s left in this condition, the other cell will reverse-charge it, causing it to off-gas its electrolyte, killing that cell completely.  If that happens, you can&#x27;t recharge it, and trying will make the battery pack get hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is P/N 37059-7, the same as for the WP350.  Amazon sells a replacement as [[ASIN:B000V2DN24 Battery for WaterPik 350W travel model.]]  It&#x27;s more than half the cost of this unit (makes sense once you open it up) and requires soldering.  Probably not worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is made of two 4/5 sub-C cells with solder tabs.  It&#x27;s just like a C cell, but 4/5 as long, and the + nub doesn&#x27;t stick out as fer.  It&#x27;s NiCd 1000mAh at 2.4V.  You can pick up two 2200mAh 4/5 Sub-C cells with solder tabs for about 1/5th the cost of the Waterpik unit.  Once the 2 cells are connected, you can just wrap it in clear tape unless you happen to have heat-shrink tubing handy.  Surgery is about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: You can&#x27;t throw these away legally because of the amount of cadmium in the battery pack.  It&#x27;s toxic and leaches into the water supply.  Don&#x27;t be lazy.  This needs to be taken to your local battery recycling shop.  If you can pull the cells out, that&#x27;s even nicer, but not really necessary.  Most hardware stores and battery stores will take returns for recycling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself is fairly cheap, so if you treat it right and get 2-5 years out of it, then great.  If you&#x27;re prone to leaving things plugged in all the time, then you&#x27;ll definitely feel cheated on this.orth the cost.    The battery is made of two 4/5 sub-C cells with solder tabs.

    <li> Bought Waterpik Waterflosser (cordless, rechargeable) March 2011. Three days later the plastic reservoir cover broke off (I think I breathed on it). My friend said the same thing happened to his.  Late August, I took it on vacation. No, I didn&#x27;t drop it. I wrapped it carefully in suitcase, carried nozzle, wrapped in tissue paper, in purse. Got home. It doesn&#x27;t work! When I turn it on, there is a weak sound, and no water comes out of nozzle. The pump is clearly not working. Not worth time and trouble to send it back to manufacturer. Will buy a Panasonic oral irrigator ($30) like I had before purchasing this piece of crap. It&#x27;s small, convenient and served me well for several years.</li>
    <li> Ordered the waterpik flosser as a replacement for a earlier version of product.  Very pleased with both the product and delivery service would purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASE A NEW WATERPIK EVERY YEAR BECAUSE I LIKE THE HIGHER PRESSURE YOU GET WITH A NEW ONE.  I USUALLY PURCHASE IT FROM THE MANUFACTURER.  THIS YEAR I TRIED AMAZON AND RECEIVED A   NEW WATERPIK RAPIDLY AND FOR $12 LESS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dental assistant. The two I purchased had short battery lives. Liked the portability. Contacted Waterpik with little assistance. I WILL have a water flosser but not this one or brand.  Going to go to corded water flosser.  FOOL ME ONCE - Shame on you, FOOL ME TWICE - Shame on me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, but doesn&#x27;t hold enough water for a good cleaning.  Have to fill twice.</li>
    <li> Worst water pick ever made. Needs to be removed from market.</li>
    <li> Much better than the older model that I had been using. I found that it held much more water--enough to do a full cleaning.</li>
    <li> I use it daily and find it convenient and easy to store. I travel with it as well. My dentist is happy with the results. I certainly would recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. Worked great at first. But, now, after 3 months, it wont hold a charge long enough to clean 1/4 of your teeth. It is an exceptionally poor quality product.</li>
    <li> wish it held a little bit more water, other than that, it works like a charm</li>
    <li> While the force of the water jet isn&#x27;t as high as the plugin versions this works nicely and saves packing space when using plane travel.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long, but it works well.  It came promptly and doesn&#x27;t take up as much room as the one I had before...</li>
    <li> We had problems with a different brand breaking after about a year.  This one has lasted a year.  Fingers crossed that it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I purchased the Waterpik of this make and style. The first lasted for a year but the second lasted 3 years. I like it because it is small and fits well on my vanity top. It is easier to handle than the more expensive bigger ones and easy to use compared to the non portable styles and bigger ones. It may not last as long but you can&#x27;t beat the price. I recommend this Waterpik...you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s slightly more cumbersome than the one I had attached to the faucet, but it works good and it&#x27;s portable.</li>
    <li> Fresh purchase... but like it already. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Only reservation that I have is that I used to have one and when the rechargable battery no longer recharged, it wasn&#x27;t replaceable.. Hope that has changed.</li>
    <li> Very useful product, made a big difference in gum health according to my dentist -- but poorly made and unreliable. When it works, it is excellent and the portability is a strong plus for someone who travels a lot. But, over the nine months of life, it had charging issues, and many days when the motor would not generate enough power to floss at the usual speed; and eventually it would not hold a charge and had to be scrapped.... I don&#x27;t like to buy shoddy, \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; products that quickly end up in landfill.</li>
    <li> Works great but haven&#x27;t gotten use to the tickling sensation but my wife loves it</li>
    <li> Not really effective.</li>
    <li> I love this waterpik. It is very straight forward in it&#x27;s use. I would recommend it for anyone new to personal, handheld water-piks.</li>
    <li> good product,  stream not as powerful as the home machine, but a good size for traveling.</li>
    <li> This model of Waterpik is very &amp;#34;user friendly&amp;#34; as it can be used in the shower.  I&#x27;ve gotten better dental exam results since I began using one.  My hygienist tells me to &amp;#34;Keep doing what you&#x27;re doing&amp;#34; since I started using one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, it has some significant problems.  The previous model had a standard recharging socket that was prone to corrosion, thus limiting the lifetime of the unit, as once corroded, it would no longer take a charge.  Many of the complaints that I&#x27;ve viewed for the current model, were actually commenting on the previous model.  The redesigned charger socket is much less prone to corrosion, and can be easily cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet I still have had problems with the current model.  The charging &amp;#34;brick&amp;#34; failed after a year. This is highly unusual, and I doubt if it will happen to other owners.  Another issue is the rechargeable battery, itself.  I only got a couple of year&#x27;s use out of it.  From reading other reviews, it does look like it is still a problem with this model, yet no one has offered an easy solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than buying an entire new unit, I simply took it to Batteries Plus, and had them replace the original batteries with new ones.  This will run about $15, so it is much cheaper than replacing the entire WaterPik.</li>
    <li> Great for brace-faced teen! Now she like taking care of her teeth!</li>
    <li> Perfect! They say you need to floss as well, but everytime I floss, my mouth feels refreshed! So now, I just only use the waterflosser. :D Update: I&#x27;ve had for 3 yrs and I am still enjoying my waterpik, now I&#x27;m purchasing one for my daughter!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and bought it from Amazon because the price was better than the stores. It really helps gums stay healthy and cleans your teeth very well.</li>
    <li> It works very well, but it seems not so powerful as the one I used before, anyway, it works good.</li>
    <li> I love it, easy to handle and very efficient.  This is my second one, wore the first one out after MANY years of good use :)</li>
    <li> I use a Waterpik at home and it does a great job -- I was never one to use dental floss as my teeth were too tight to get the floss through, but the Waterpik did the trick. This device is perfect for traveling. Obviously, its a portable unit so the water capacity is smaller than a counter top model, but I find that I can to the top set of teeth on one fill, then the bottom set after a refill -- no big deal. Its great. Had it for a while now and it has a permanent place in my shaving kit.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended by my Dentist and it seems to be doing the job. Controlling the aim and keeping my mouth shut is the challenge!!&lt;br /&gt;But after a couple of months I&#x27;m not having to wipe down as much on the mirror and counter.</li>
    <li> I bought this water flosser to replace an older one that the battery had worn out on. That one worked for 4 years without incident.  I could have replaced the battery but chose to buy a new model. I cannot live without my Waterpic. My gums and teeth are healthy and it does an excellent job cleaning around crowns and an implant.  The battery on this model holds a charge for about a week&#x27;s worth of cleanings without having to recharge. My older model seemed to have a longer battery life but this is sufficient.  I just plug it in overnight every weekend.  The water reservoir holds just enough to do your mouth once.  If you need more water it is easy to refill. The amount of water pressure is good, enough to clean but not so much that you hurt sensitive gum tissues.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this hand held flosser.  Mine lasted only a year before it died and the pressure from the flosser is almost non existent.  You are much better off spending the extra money and getting the platinum counter top model.  It is far superior and does a much better job.  What a disappointment this product is!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using the water pik because its easy and stores nicley.</li>
    <li> This thing is horrible.  The reservoir is so small, you have to fill it several times in order to clean your whole mouth.  Secondly, this thing is is unwieldy that it&#x27;s very difficult to maneuver around to clean those hard to reach places.  Oh yeah, and while you&#x27;re maneuvering it around to clean those hard to reach places, it stops feeding water to the tip and starts blowing air on your teeth!</li>
    <li> I have bought 2 of them and the batteries are not good, can not replace and need charging all the time. Eventually they won&#x27;t charge good at all.  It would be a great product if they could get the battery situation fixed.</li>
    <li> Its like a jellyfish boxer punching you in the mouth repetitively. Its not fun. And its a mess.</li>
    <li> It works ok but, th battery life is  bad, About 2 month after purchasing the battery started showing of end of life.</li>
    <li> Very bad compared to prior models by Waterpik. The on/off switch does not click &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; so you have to hold the button w/ your finger. And the pressure is way too strong &amp; uncomfortable. Might be useful to clean your hubcaps, but I&#x27;m throwing it in the trash.</li>
    <li> love it just what i needed</li>
    <li> I always bring this with me when I am traveling.</li>
    <li> Useless, as far as I am concerned.  Clunky huge size makes it inconvenient to use.  Highly undesirable.</li>
    <li> Great product and has a lots of pressure to clean your teeth.Easy to use and nice  grip.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it last long.Price is right.</li>
    <li> This oral irrigator is so weak that it leaves behind all kinds of food particles.  Yes, it&#x27;s rechargeable but that doesn&#x27;t matter if the water stream has no power.  The other annoying thing is that the irrigator tip rotates on it&#x27;s own.  It&#x27;s impossible to control the spray.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I received it very fast and works really well!! This is the second Waterpik I bought (one for me, one for my boyfriend) and both work like they are suppose too! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> The water pik works great for my daughters new invasalign.  She indicated it really is able to get some of the food out of the hard to reach areas.  Good seller as well.</li>
    <li> I have used a water-pik for the last few years. This was a replacement, and the water-pik has&lt;br /&gt;improved since the last one that I purchased. Sure wish that I had started using a water-pik&lt;br /&gt;years ago. This new one seems better made, and has stronger pressure.</li>
    <li> I like this waterpik and relatively inexpensive.  I just starting using this and so much easier than floss thread.  The charge has held for 2 weeks with every other day use.  I like the two pic head option and use the gentler one currently.  I would guess the really benefits will come at my next dental exam!</li>
    <li> Works in the shower! My teeth never felt cleaner!</li>
    <li> Well even thought I saw some of the bad reviews didn&#x27;t look good for this product I bought one and so far it seems to do a good job of getting food from between my teeth. It may not work as well on someone else, but I like it. It is a little messy and you have to learn how to keep the water in your mouth or let it run out as you use it. I turn it off and start at a differant spots when my mouth fills up with water. Whatever works for you is good. So far the battery issue on the other reviews is&#x27;nt a problem yet, sence I haven&#x27;t had it very long. I hope the warrenty will take care of that if the time comes. If the manufacturer does have a problem with the battery I hope they get it resolved because it is a good little flosser and I love it so far. Lynn from Saint Louis Missouri.</li>
    <li> Works great, is compact and easy to use. This was a replacement for a more expensive model. So far, it works just as well.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product with some minor drawbacks which I feel are compensated for by it&#x27;s good price and its portability.&lt;br /&gt;yes it has a small reservoir but I&#x27;m at the sink anyway so it takes 4 seconds to refill  and when i travel it goes with me using very little space. i would like it better if it had replaceable batteries rather than just rechargeable</li>
    <li> It change my life and make my teeth looks much better. Has two different speeds and a big tank that allow charge enought water</li>
    <li> Too bad waterpik didn&#x27;t offer me, a Dentist, a free replacement.  T shouldn&#x27;t have had to buy this retail, regardless of the price.</li>
    <li> Just brought this item from Target.  Mine is a little bit different from the one shown in the pic - has a two prong charger inlet.  Anyway, so far so good.  I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days, but I&#x27;m hooked.  I hope it last a long time, but I&#x27;ll be sure to keep my receipt in the meanwhile.  I love that its portable so I can floss/rinse/clean my gums at work.  I mostly liked the price and I didn&#x27;t need a lot of bells and whistles.  Simple product with a lot of good pressure.</li>
    <li> love my new water pic does great job just when you think you got everything wow more to come even after brushing and flossing also need a receipt for purchase to get  rebate never received one thanks the gizzard</li>
    <li> This is the 4th Waterpik flosser I&#x27;ve had.  I travel a lot and this is the only one that is easily packed.  I have been very disappointed in the length of time the batteries last.  Not the time after they are charged, but the overall life of the battery,  I may be responsible for not properly storing it.  I intend to keep it charged, but if this does not produce the results I want, I probably will not buy another.</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;A good enough product that dentists still recommend. . but why oh why does Amazon send it and bill me twice. I ordered it to go to a different address but they sent it to both my regular one and the second,  billing me twice. Their error, my $25 or so extra. Worse, no clear way to remove the second address from my file. Result: Anything else I ever buy apparently gets double-billed and double-sent. Hence, no more  buying by this person from AMAZON.</li>
    <li> Worked Great when it actually worked. After a couple of months of regular use (2 times a day, once in the morning and another before I went to bed), it completely stopped working. I&#x27;m really disappointed because I spent a bit of money on this product.</li>
    <li> Dependable machine - great for cleaning food between teeth and into pockets of gum line.  This is my second one.  First one lasted about 4 years before it suddenly gave out.</li>
    <li> The model was recommended by my dental hygienist as reliable, effective, and  easy to use.  The battery charge lasts a long time &amp; it is easy to use.  Plus, my dentist says my gums look great!   The only problem I had was trying to find it on a store shelf as it was always sold out!  When I found it at Amazon.com, it was cheaper which was great!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this item. By the time it completely failed, after about four months, I could no longer return it. Basically, it would not hold a charge. The charge became weaker and weaker until it finally refused to charge at all. Also, I expected it to provide a more powerful stream, which it did not. On the upside, though, it was very convenient as an \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; hand-held device.</li>
    <li> the product is as good as the original but the resevoir is a little different making it difficult to fill</li>
    <li> The product is great for travel , put I would not recomend for daily use. The charge has held for 2 weeks. The water container only holds enough water to do about half the mouth, So you need to refill a few time to do a good job. Also the presure is not adjustible like a normal water pik, you can adjust only by changing the heads on the product. It does work, but I would prefer a traditional unit for daily use.</li>
    <li> This hand held model works fine but the water tank is too small. You need to fill it at least twice.</li>
    <li> Ok, I am now using my third portable waterpik.  I think the reason for the battery problem is where they put the charging socket, on the front of the unit where water can often enter.  The rubber socket cover is not adequate to keep water out.  Nevertheless,  I travel often and use my waterpik after every possible meal, and swear using them has saved me thousands in potential dental bills.  I used to use the plug in kind and they are hands down 100 times better, but if you can&#x27;t use an ac model, then this is the way to go.  They do have a two year warranty.  I think I will send two of them back together and I&#x27;ll let you know whether the warranty is honored. Either way I&#x27;ll continue using one and just consider it a disposable item.  Easy annual gift from one of my kids! Also, if your kids have braces a Waterpik is a must!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s neither as easy to use or efficient as the regular model, but it takes up less counter space and does a fairly good job of dislodging food hiding between teeth.  However, mine was sent from factory missing one tip, and the company has yet (several weeks have passed since being notified) contacted me or sent me the second tip. Each tip allows a different amount of water pressure to be applied to gums.</li>
    <li> I loved this Waterpik at first because I&#x27;m limited on counter space and it seemed the perfect solution.  However, after about 8 months of using it I wish I would&#x27;ve bought the plug-in version.  Just like many other reviewers I find that the thing will not hold a charge for very long.  You might not think it&#x27;s a big deal to recharge it but a full charge delivers the full amount of pressure and the correct jet pressure delivers the results you&#x27;re after. My dentist just told me that my gums don&#x27;t look as good as they did 3 months ago because my Waterpik is ineffective unless fully charged.  Sooooo.... I will be researching a better quality unit and would caution anyone who&#x27;s thinking of purchasing this.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that every adult should use.  Just ask your dentist.  This is my second identical product.  The first unit had the rechargeable battery fail after 2  years.  Perhaps the new one will do better.  I am suggesting getting a universal Velleman 1.5 amp AC adapter (from Amazon)and turn the defunct battery unit into a wired device.</li>
    <li> I did not like the design as water would spill out unless you hold it upright. It totally stopped working within 2 months. A total was of money. I love the home model but it is not very convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> This is a good gadget. I am using it for a year and it works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;I did have to alter the switch to make it work as momentery instead of a toggle.&lt;br /&gt;With a momentary function I have better control because it stops as soon as the&lt;br /&gt;the switch is released saving the water in the tank and avoiding making a mass around.&lt;br /&gt;{this may be a good advice for the manufacturer}</li>
    <li> Adequate for my uses. It runs out of water pretty quickly. Pressure is fine and seems to work pretty well</li>
    <li> I  bought this model thinking I would be getting something that performed like my previous corded model.  WRONG!. The reservoir is difficult to fill without spilling, and sometimes the water comes up the tip to squirt at you,  There&#x27;s no room for an adequate water supply; I need four messy fills  to do the thorough job I did with my previous Waterpik, and the handle is awkward to hold and has to be held upright to work.  Even then, I don&#x27;t get the strength of water flow that I got with the other model.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a week; so I haven&#x27;t had personal experience with the battery, but from what I read, even that doesn&#x27;t perform.  My advice:  GET THE CORDED MODEL.</li>
    <li> This product works as described and is cheaper when you purchase it from Amazon.com. I would recommend it for its cordless convenience and its so far so good reliability. Also seems to charge really fast.</li>
    <li> This was a great product initially.  Very early on though, the frequency of needing to charge increased.  After about nine months the unit failed to accept a charge and the battery is not replaceable.  The useful life of this product is lousy.</li>
    <li> Need more time or more water</li>
    <li> used it few times does not keep charge.</li>
    <li> DOESN&#x27;T HAVE GREAT POWER&lt;br /&gt;WATER STREAM IS VERY WEAK</li>
    <li> well i put the mouthwash or water in the holder,i put it  on the counter to charge and realize that there was a ring of mouthwas under the device,and i noticed must be leaking ,i couldnt find the leak,it still works,but i am wondering about the blue stain thats left on the  counter this is the second waterpik that has been defective not good</li>
    <li> Love it!  If you have trouble using floss, this is the perfect answer.</li>
    <li> Affordable and does the job!</li>
    <li> I use it at home and and take along the charger when I travel.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these units ... one for me and one for my wife.  It&#x27;s been a year and half and mine still works ... my wife&#x27;s seems to be beyond repair.    Pros:  1. Handy to use in shower (even if it takes a refill).  2. Low cost  Cons:  1. Switch on Wife&#x27;s unit didn&#x27;t stay in off position (does now) ... this may have resulted in it&#x27;s ultimate failure.  2. Batteries seem to lose power over time.  3. No charge indicator light.  4. Realively low quality as a result of poor battery.  5. Require occasional flush/cleaning ... then it works better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing about a year and the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long at all.  It used to, but no more.  Other than that, I like everything else about it.</li>
    <li> Like it because it&#x27;s handy, convenient, and takes up little counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike it because you can&#x27;t see how much water remains in the well.</li>
    <li> I replaced a deluxe water pick with this rechargeable model when the hose to the pick started leaking.  The rechargeable worked ok, but the water stream was much weaker than the original.  Within a year the battery would not hold enough charge, making the water pressure even weaker. Luckily I saved the old water pick and found a replacement hose for around $10.  This has been a much better option.  Save your money and repair your old water pick and don&#x27;t waste your money on this rechargeable model.</li>
    <li> I was honestly quite disappointed with this product. At the price, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try, but I have been extremely disappointed with it.   The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long, as other have stated. But that&#x27;s not my biggest complaint. I have to refill the water tank at least 3 times each time I \\&quot;floss\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in a beautiful package. Charged it overnight and the next morning it cleaned all of my teeth, well both of them. The size is smaller than what I had previously had but on a trip it could be packed in with your other stuff and therefore would not need it&#x27;s own suitcase like some of those fancy kinds. Instead of a separate switch for soft and strong you only have to change tip to achieve this function. What could be simpler. If one is a fan of clean teeth they should rush an order for one of these beauties.</li>
    <li> I used twice for get away trip, and after four months i tried to use it and i did not work at all. bad quality for a good name.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this waterpik. I like the two different attachment heads.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tested to see how long it keeps a charge, I just charge mine once a week.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to fill and empty. Love the price. Sometimes I add mouthwash with the water.</li>
    <li> It broke within 4 weeks after I bought it.  It worked very well up to that moment but for so litle time.  I didn&#x27;t have the box anymore since I threw it away after a few days.  Otherwise I&#x27;d have sent it back.</li>
    <li> I got this because I hate flossing and this makes it so easy! My teeth always feel really clean and good after I have used it.</li>
    <li> Difficult to use: it takes two hands to aim the thing. It also requires multiple refillings to complete the job</li>
    <li> My first Waterpik wad purchased in 2010 and it was great! But a year after I bought it, I accidently left it at a hotel. So I bought another one. Within 3 months it stopped holding a charge. I was very frustrated with the lack of quality and tossed it away. After reading the poor reviews, which out number the good on Amazon, I went with a different brand. But it too stopped working quickly. Less than 30 days to be more specific. So I&#x27;m back to square one, 2yrs and 3 picks later. I did read a couple of reviews on the Waterpik that say the poor cord design can be fixed with something from Radio Shack. And given the low price, it is tempting to purchase this. But right now I can not convince myself that&#x27;s the best reason. Maybe Waterpick will fix their problem and I can return as a customer.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t understand how they get away with still selling these , there is obviously a huge flaw with the recharging unit. I have just thrown away my third, which lasted just over a year, but has been not charging properly for half that time. The other two lasted less time ! I keep trying as I think when it works it does a great job and I prefer it to flossing. I give up now though .</li>
    <li> The water &amp;#34;tank&amp;#34; is smaller than my old model but still sufficient to do the job. Iuse it often and I like it.</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised and arrived as scheduled.  It suits the purpose for which it was ordered.  Definitely would order again.</li>
    <li> The product is very useful but after having it for less than a year it will not hold a charge. Hate to have to break down and buy another but the flosser really helps with my daily oral hygiene routine.</li>
    <li> does not have  water pressure for very long. stops working before all water used up I would nt recomend this model</li>
    <li> This is a lot of fun to use. I love how my teeth feel after I use it. It&#x27;s great to use</li>
    <li> Works fine but only hold enough water for thirty seconds but for me this is long enough. I am anxious to see how it holds up. This item is offered at Wal-mart for about $ 10.00 or more. I will let you know how well it stands up. The price alone is enough to give it a good try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It has now been two months and the product is still holding up like a champ. You do need to charge it frequently but, this is not a big problem for me. I also purchased an extended square trade warranty for it just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought in August 2012: Wont hold charge and it&#x27;s get up and go has got up and left. They are sending me another but with the problems I have had over the time I have had it it is probably best to just get one that has beet evals. Sorry for the misleading evaluations at first but it did work OK for a time but ultimately not worth it. Read some other evaluations and make your decision from all the info. people have provided. More than likely it will not work out for you either. Sorry! Lasted only six months total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Company did send another right away but I can tell already it is losing power rapidly even when you just pull it off the charger. Disappointed...</li>
    <li> Very effective for tooth cleaning.</li>
    <li> I bought the waterpik listed as a new item. But when it arrived, it was obviously a returned item. The package had been opened and repacked. There was no way to tell if it had been used or not, but I didn&#x27;t risk it. Since this is a dental hygiene item, I didn&#x27;t want to use it. It was returned.</li>
    <li> This product is an old standby for us -- we have both been using Waterpik for years.  My wife uses hers at least twice a day, so she wears them out faster than I do, so I was happy to get such a great buy on it.</li>
    <li> i Needed a small waterpick for travel.  This size is handy and adequate for the purpose.  Cordless and rechargable are positive features.</li>
    <li> great value,  love mine,  easy to fill and use,  cordless makes it easy  to take into the shower no mess.</li>
    <li> Great ! Works perfectly fine. I bought it for my husband for travelling and he is happy with it. Kind of heavy but he is ok with this fact.</li>
    <li> What we like about this waterpik is that it is self contained and has no cord.  It does its job well enough so that this is the second one we have bought.</li>
    <li> Very handy while travelling. Easy to use and very easy to dry and repack when you are finished using it.</li>
    <li> very well made battery lasts long time before charging/ very satisfied</li>
    <li> Ya know how after you eat corn on the cob and now you have corn funk stuck in your teeth?&lt;br /&gt;not any more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you just pummeled some Oreo double stuf... got dark chocolate in the folds of your molars&lt;br /&gt;gone in a squirt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You decided to eat an apple with no regard to your braces...&lt;br /&gt;Apple remnants blasted through...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good stuff....</li>
    <li> Well this is some what of an improvement from the battery operated one. It does not have the power of the standard waterpik but is a passable item for when one is traveling.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good but takes getting used to, it splashes unless you keep your mouth closed.  It is working good for the price.</li>
    <li> In less than one month use battery will not hold a charge and water resoivoir has no filter so residue from tap water get stuck in tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S.P.</li>
    <li> What I disliked was the opening for the water vessal, it is to small and you need to be very careful when filling it.  Other that that it works fine</li>
    <li> This flosser is fine, but has to be recharged almost every day...I had one before this and it did not need so much recharging...otherwise it is fine</li>
    <li> I had a water flosser for several years. Finally the battery died. My dentist had another mechanical flosser that used air and she recommended it. I thought, &amp;#34;maybe it&#x27;s good to make a change.&amp;#34; HA! I got that competitor&#x27;s flosser out and each time I hit the button to floss a tooth it felt like some one was punching me. Not gentle at all. Quite disturbing. I boxed it all up and send it back, thinking &amp;#34;I want my Waterpik Waterflosser back.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have it again I fully appreciate the smooth way it glides between each tooth and massages the gums with no irritating pressure.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t floss with a string floss because my childhood orthodontist packed my teeth so closely together that I can&#x27;t get anything in between. Waterflosser does get in the spaces and my dental check ups prove it.</li>
    <li> This is a bad product.  It feels awkward in your hand and the pik is too short to clean in the back of your mouth without feeling like you have to put part of the water pik base inside your mouth.  I would have returned it but lost track of time and missed the deadline to do so.</li>
    <li> After buying this item 5 times and having each one break down within a few months, I give up.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it when it worked and the price is reasonable but a company like Waterpik should be able to make a product that repeatedly decides to stop working for no apparent reason. Once Waterpik even sent me a replacement and that one sated longer....almost 3 months. I will never buy another Waterpik. I should have listened to the bad reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;MW</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical of this device because I was convinced that there was no way it could replace (and be even better than) flossing. I was proved wrong. The first time I used it, I was surprised by how much &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; it removed from my teeth - and this was after flossing. After that, I was totally hooked. I just had my six-month checkup with my dentist, and my dental hygienist actually complimented my clean gums. This is a huge accomplishment because nothing is ever good for those hygienists! So if you want to stop flossing and make your annoying hygienist shut the hell up, buy this little bad boy. Oh, it&#x27;s also a great bargain, too! It&#x27;s about $10 more expensive in stores and at other online retailers.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this product. He thinks this is the best thing ever</li>
    <li> where do I get a replacement battery.</li>
    <li> In 7 months - I&#x27;m on my 3rd water reservoir, 2nd power unit and this one is failing rapidly.  It is poorly designed and quality control seems nonexistent. Food particles constantly build up between the reservoir and power handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The svc dept is actually the best part of this experience, likely because they get LOTS of practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THE MODEL 360</li>
    <li> Easier and more effective than flossing with string,  getting plaque and debris between teeth and below the gumline for a deep, thorough clean.</li>
    <li> This is my third water pik.  They seem to work for several months and then won&#x27;t hold a charge.  Not real pleased.</li>
    <li> This new version of pic and charger combo worked much better than previous model.  It now holds a charge for several uses, and seems to have more blasting power, perhaps due to better battery design.</li>
    <li> Pro:  Portable&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  Nice handle size for smaller hands&lt;br /&gt;Con:  Doesn&#x27;t hold enough water&lt;br /&gt;Con:  The spray nozzel spins freely on the base so in addition to holding the device with one hand, you have to use your other hand to keep the spray nozzel from  flipping the wrong direction in your mouth and watering your bathroom or spraying an eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this one and at the same time I bought a Showerbreeze that installs on your shower head.  After using both, I prefer the Showerbreeze that I installed on my shower head.</li>
    <li> i was pleased and was going to give this 5 stars, but its performance has declined.  I have a corded Waterpik that I have used daily for several years.  I have braces and bought this rechargeable model a little over a month ago to take on vacation and trips.  The water pressure at first was much less than my corded model, but it was sufficient to get the job done.  I was pleased with it and had no problem refilling the reservoir once for each cleaning.  However, even though I keep it fully charged, the water pressure has gradually declined to about 1/2 of the original pressure.  The only plus is that each water fill lasts much longer since less water comes out (LoL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try and return this.  I would not recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> They only last a year!</li>
    <li> After just a few months of use it would no longer take a charge.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement was glad I could find it. Liked the old one love the new one</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it was easier than the larger container model I have had for many years. I can take this when I go away. Been using for about three weeks.  I do like it.  Seems that you have to fill up twice for about a minute worth of flossing. Also have to turn on its side to get most of the water out when you get down to the bottom. But all in all I thought it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I had purchased five of this waterpik product for me and some friends.  It is like my American Express... I don&#x27;t leave home without it.  I spend less than 20mins when I go to my dentist for my cleanning.  It keeps my mouth fresh all day long.  I have one in my office and one at home.  I wish they can last for several years beacuse I use them so much of the time after a meal or snack.</li>
    <li> We all have our own Waterpik and the kids can keep their teeth and gums really clean. Braces can make gums swell if they are not cleaned thoroughly. The Waterpik is amazing and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I bought it for my mother, who needs it for cleaning her dental bridge. It is an additional aide for reaching places an elderly person has difficulties with and her dentist is very pleased with the results. I would recommend this for anyone who needs the additional help with cleaning their bridge or dentures.</li>
    <li> WORST THING WATER PICK EVER PUT ON THE MARKET&lt;br /&gt; GET YOUR SELF A FULL SIZE WATER PICK EVERY THING ELSE SEAMS TO BE GARBAGE I TRIED THIS RECHARGEABLE GARBAGE  WASTING YOUR MONEY&lt;br /&gt; GET THE FULL SIZE IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE ROOM AND A PLUG FOR IT&lt;br /&gt; THEN MOVE ON DOWN THE ROAD YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY WITH THIS  ONE .THIS WILL MAKE YOU SAD YOU PURCHASED IT AND THAT IS HOW I AM VERY SAD I PURCHASED THIS RECHARGEABLE WATER PICK THE WORST THING THEY EVER MADE&lt;br /&gt; AND I LIKE WATER PICKS THIS ONE IS JUST NOT FOR ME I REALLY THINK YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY WITH THIS ONE!!!!!!.</li>
    <li> This is the simplest (and most refreshing) way to get into those crevices of your teeth. I wouldn&#x27;t live without one! Easy and convenient to do, so you&#x27;ll never hesitate to use it daily.</li>
    <li> I already have one of these Waterpiks, now I have an extra one for travel. Like the size and the choice I have between stronger or weaker spray. Like that it can be plugged in and I don&#x27;t have to buy batteries when it runs down.</li>
    <li> Really, after so many years of bad reviews based on these three problems, you&#x27;d think someone at WaterPik would have gotten the message. I know I wish I&#x27;d have read the reviews before buying this terrible product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s died.  It doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  I can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s wrong with it now.  Help Help Help Help Help  Can I return it and get another?</li>
    <li> Disappointed with this product. It was great for the first couple of weeks, but then stop holding a charge. The water goes for about a minute now, then dies, even though I keep the charger plugged in pretty much 24-7. Suppose I&#x27;ll try the version with the cord next. Don&#x27;t waste your time on this!</li>
    <li> Everyone should have one!</li>
    <li> wonderful, convenient</li>
    <li> This is the fourth or fifth unit I&#x27;ve had of this waterpik.  I love it because it puts out a great stream of water, and is easy and convenient to use.  And its small enough to put in my bath vanity drawer, out of my picky wife&#x27;s line of vision.  What I hate:  I&#x27;ve never had one that lasted more than 2 years.  One of them crapped out at less than a year.  The last one lasted the longest, so maybe they are getting better. No matter....I&#x27;ll keep buying this product as long as I have real teeth....which dailey use of this thing will help with.  Update: I finally got fed up with these irrigators and switched to the ToileTree brand irrigator in July of 2014.  Please see my review of their product.</li>
    <li> This waterpik replaced one that had a \\&quot;remote\\&quot; water source connected by a tube to the pik.  I am finding this waterpik is too bulky even for larger hands.  The pik rotates by itself rather than staying in one place and allowing me to direct the stream.  If I had a choice I would return to the less bulky, easier to handle pik.</li>
    <li> They only last about 2 to 3 months and that is either this model or the more expensive model.  They do a good job but the pump fails way to early.  Purchased 3 in 1 yr. before giving up on them.  The original A/C models are the best!</li>
    <li> I really like it and I find it strong enough. my hygienist recommends to use it along with flossing not instead of flossing. I put a piece of band aid to cover the adaptor hole to protect from moisture after reading some reviews suggestion that this might stretch the life of the battery. much more convenient to have and more concealed.  I have an electric braun toothbrush that matches this colors.</li>
    <li> Will not hold a full charge anymore. after a 24hour charge it starts losing it&#x27;s power right away. and mayby you can use it one or two times before its done.</li>
    <li> the water-pick I purchased is not at all to my satisfaction.  It is clumsy to handle, won&#x27;t hold a charge, water tank to small.  I had water-picks before but not the hand held pick.  I would not recomend it to anyone, not even for travel.</li>
    <li> This handheld model is great for a single person.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year with no problems.  I dropped it and broke the tip.  But it comes with an extra and the device itself held up just fine.  This has been a lifesaver because I hate to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for more than one person because it would be kind of inconvenient to change the tip every time.</li>
    <li> Have one myself and bought this for teen granddaughter who just got braces and this is a perfect gift/necessity. ../.,Quality product&lt;br /&gt;and durable for years of use.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik has good power but they don&#x27;t last long if you use it every day. The batteries don&#x27;t hold up to repeated charging like others I&#x27;m use to. Not made for replacement either. This is the third and I&#x27;m moving on to another brand.</li>
    <li> I would like this unit better if it worked from the wire as well as the battery but it doesn the job just fine.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that not only helps floss, and keep your teeth clean, over several weeks you may be pleased to find that it helps whiten them as well. I noticed that my teeth became whiter without the plaque buildup.</li>
    <li> I have owned the Waterpick 360 for about a year now (actually bought it from Target cause I had a great coupon).  No problems with charging, I use it daily and charge it about once a month and have no corrosion problems with the plug on the unit. Power of water is great, as good as the day I bought it. Reservoir is absolutely adequate for whole mouth, I didn&#x27;t want something that was to heavy. As a woman, fits in my hand just fine, I wear a medium size glove. I charge it up before travel for 2 week trip and leave the plug at home. Just wish there were some grip lines on the handle. So, I am very happy with the unit and got rid of the water pick that sat on my counter top. This is much cleaner. No water all over the counter. I clean it by running a little white vinegar through it, keep the lid open and set it upside down to drain well. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik works very well for slightly more than one year - then the pulsing slows almost overnight.  The warranty is in effect for one year, so I am in the market for a product from a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> The water pressure is too  intense and some fillings fell out. I had the larger water pic with graduated water pressure&lt;br /&gt;which was much better. I  guess you get what you pay for.. ..dissappointed</li>
    <li> Not quite what I thought it would be, The well must be refilled frequently and the tip swivels to easily and directs water everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is a lousy item. The rechargeable battery died in less than one year and has to be plugged in always not to use&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy one</li>
    <li> this unit works great for ONE YEAR and then it is junk.  I have purchased two of these units and they both lost the battery recharge capability starting after 9 months and then were done.  I will not buy another and advise you to think twice about the life span of this product.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and no mess</li>
    <li> I have used both this model, and the newer \\&quot;plus\\&quot; version (WP440),  and I consider the plus to be meaningfully better than this model. In particular the speed options, and reservoir tank difference are better on the newer version than this one.</li>
    <li> Really good tool for keeping teeth clean and gums healthy</li>
    <li> An important tool in keeping your gums healthy</li>
    <li> It would be okay -- it actually works, though clumsily -- but it wears out. One of the tips quit working almost immediately and I had to reorder refills (they only come two to a pack). A week after spending $10 on refills, the whole unit quit working. Like everyone else&#x27;s complaint, I&#x27;m fairly sure it&#x27;s the battery. It&#x27;s kind of a rip-off when it just quits working after you&#x27;ve only owned it for a few months.</li>
    <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t last very long but what is more frustrating is the water tank is way to small to acomplish a very through cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have been through two devices.  Both lasted about 6 months and then stopped working.  I was satisfied with the cleaning ability but you can&#x27;t count on it not to break in less than 6 months.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son because I already have one that I love, he loves it too, it has been a big saver on dental bills.</li>
    <li> I had a water pik that I had used before and it still works but using a second one when I travel every week.  I have dental implants replacing a bridge for top front teeth and this works great for cleaning around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the clear nozzle since that is strong enough to not have to use floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grateful there is such a product to use.</li>
    <li> its great so far. the only thing i dont like is the amount of water it holds. you have to refill it often to get the whole mouth. it works great though.</li>
    <li> Not quite as much power as the one I had but does the job</li>
    <li> purchased as a gift and my son loves it.  Priced fair and I would use the selling again for future purchases.</li>
    <li> The unit works as advertised but I can only use it a couple times briefly befroe the battery needs charging again. That is very poor since i have a Norelco razor that i use for a month before it needs a recharge so there are much better batteries out there.</li>
    <li> I bought my first one March 31 2013...it died in one month. I was sent a replacement immediately and without question. Now...that one has also died - a little over a year and a half later.&lt;br /&gt;So...they don&#x27;t live very long...you might want to consider the Braun travel waterpik...had one in Germany for 3 years and it&#x27;s still going strong !!</li>
    <li> A peice of junk. Runs out of water quickly. Awkward to position it to reach all areas of the mouth. Leaks. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Get a traditional corded flosser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 of these so far. They all lose their charge after 6-9 months of use. At first, I thought I had a defective unit so I bought a new one. Then it happened again and I was too lazy to research a better one and bought a new one - same thing happened - it doesn&#x27;t charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when it was in peak performance, it would only hold 1-2 days worth of a charge. And the power of the water decreases over time. I wish I would have saved my money and just bought a decent waterflosser to begin with.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t have all the pieces that I expected it to have. It also smelled really bad almost as if it had been used and not cleaned properly.</li>
    <li> I bought a WaterFlosser--which was real&#x27; stupid--because I already have a showerhead that can perform its oral hygienic irrigation function much more effectively.  I&#x27;ve never sacrificed a loyal $20 on such a lost cause (That&#x27;s saying a lot! Many years ago, I paid that amount for \\&quot;The Reagan Diaries\\&quot;. If I wanted to read the rambling, childishly patriotic musings of an aging conservative who makes frequent spelling errors, I should&#x27;ve become penpals with someone at the nursing home). To be fair, I should add that the Flosser&#x27;s reservoir can be loaded with mouthwash. It sounds like a great feature, but that was just way too much Listerine, way too pressurized, way too quickly. The silver lining to that dental trauma was that the intense, minty burning sensation gave me some much-needed empathy for fire eaters--but I&#x27;m still comfortable with thinking of them as subhuman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously...my first one wouldn&#x27;t charge and WaterPik sent me a replacement; it was completely free! This was a gesture that I very much appreciated. The customer service person was extremely polite, didn&#x27;t ask a ton of questions, didn&#x27;t require a receipt--I only needed the unit number, which was labeled on the product itself. However, the (fully functional) replacement wasn&#x27;t worth the money that I sacrificed for it. As I mentioned above, I already own a showerhead. On a related note, WaterPik manufactures showerheads. They probably came up with this admittedly clever idea to squeeze some extra money out of the consumer class. Maybe the bigger one is a better product, it has a four-point-something star rating. I would recommend that you try it, but it would be reckless to take the advice of an internet stranger who writes really long product reviews.</li>
    <li> I received my Waterpik Waterflosser a few days ago, but according to the directions its needs to charge for 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I used it this morning and was very pleased.  For more of a portable unit; the water pressure is wonderful, it has a lot of force.  It gets all the particles of debri right out.  The force is so powerful that you have to make sure it is in your mouth fully and that you turn it off, as the directions indicated, before you take it out of your mouth.  I didn&#x27;t so I had water on the mirror and sink which proves that it has excellent force for removable of debri between the teeth and anywhere else in the mount such as braces or bridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am very pleased with this purchase.  I feel that I will get a much better report from the dentist now that I have this tool.&lt;br /&gt;Just using floss was not as effective as it should be since my teeth or so tight and it is difficult to floss.</li>
    <li> i need this for travel - it seems to run out pretty quick so i will have to learn to be quicker or fill it up twice</li>
    <li> This gift was appreciated.  I have one myself so I know the quality and I like mine so the receiver should be happy too.</li>
    <li> Battery lasts just 1 year, no matter how you charged it.  I went through 3 complete units, and have just changed to the Oral unit.</li>
    <li> friend left their new one (chistmas gift) at my place so I sent them a new one. Clean teeth and gums!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in late May 2012. It stopped working on May 16 2013. I was very disappointed and would not buy another waterpik.</li>
    <li> This waterpikwill no longer charge. It has always been difficult to charge.  It does not have a light so you can see for sure that it is charging.I just checked and I have had it just over a year so I will have to buy another one; it will be a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> it was good as long as it lasted, This is the second one I have owned and they tend to leak water inside in a short time and shorts out and no longer work.</li>
    <li> Only negative is that the water reservoir doesn&#x27;t hold much water. Besides that...works great!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I went ahead and bought this. I should have known better. I had seen there were alot of complaints around the battery life, which others said you wouldn&#x27;t have issues with if you stuck to charging around eight hours and ensuring you got a good, overnight first charge. After less than a year, the battery seems to run down so much faster. What&#x27;s more annoying is that even when charged, the  stream is no longer strong (which kinda defeats the purpose anyway of buying it in the first place). Other cons - it doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying case (and it&#x27;s supposed to be a travel version) and cleaning it up is messy... I feel you never really get the inside of the case clean, which is concerning since it contains water on a daily basis, and then needs to dry out.</li>
    <li> This is an updated version with a redesigned battery. It lasts 10 times longer than old model!</li>
    <li> This is a great WaterPik.</li>
    <li> LOVE this  did order a set of the higher pressure jet heads but I can use this for a week between charges and it fits on my sink easily where I will see it and use it every day</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my 11 year old granddaughter who was recently fitted with braces.  She was used to flossing the usual way but was really having a hard time getting the job done around the wires and brackets.  Her dental tech mentioned that a waterflosser might be helpful... so I went to Amazon.  I bought this model because it had two choices of cleaning heads, and was rechargable, like her toothbrush.  She uses it faithfully and says it&#x27;s a lot easier to keep her teeth clean. Whatever it takes, huh?</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.  It definitely does what it says...keeps your teeth super flossed where regular flossing doesn&#x27;t get it all. It is a small size and you do have to refill but it so simple to do that and it&#x27;s worth it to have it compact and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this because it is terrible!  It is heavy and awkward to hold, and the water drips everywhere.  Plus there&#x27;s not enough pressure get the job done right.  I went back to the original design which I should have ordered in the first place.</li>
    <li> I use my waterpik a lot because my gums have receded. It does a good job.  I am going to change my rating from 5 to 2. This unit&#x27;s battery lasts only about four months. I am going to use a passive water source where the unit hooks to the water spigot, no battery needed.</li>
    <li> - It&#x27;s bulky and hard to hold. They needed to reshape it so there is an indentation of your fingers to grip it with.&lt;br /&gt;- The tank is too small. on average, I have to refill it 4 times to do my whole mouth.&lt;br /&gt;- It requires you to hold it vertically to get full pressure, which as another reviewer stated, requires you to basically stand on your head to get your back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;- The rotating tip rotates on it&#x27;s own too easily, changing position while you floss and not doing as good of a job.&lt;br /&gt;- My teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean with this as when I was just flossing. I used it for about two weeks, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; in the end, I returned this and will be opting for the tank model and see how it does.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  A bit clumsy to use but better than lugging around the full waterpik while on vacation or traveling.</li>
    <li> Worked for a few weeks. After, the charging time has increased a lot and the working time after a full charge was really small.Other question: it is a huge device, impossible to carry in a small wallet for your job. I would use the word &amp;#34;transportable&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34; for this device.  Don´t waste your money to have one more piece of decoration for your  bathroom.</li>
    <li> Great flosser! Great water pressure and gets all of the debris from teeth. Only glitch is that you have to refill it often, so I do so in the bath or shower. Very worth it!</li>
    <li> I felt that the pulsing of the water should be stronger. I was disappointed that it was not as effective as some other water pick products I have bought in the past.</li>
    <li> This didnt have much power, and it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> When it works it&#x27;s awesome. Unfortunately the battery does not last long at all and dies despite proper recharging.</li>
    <li> This is my second waterpik.  My first one lasted forever so I re-ordered a new one.  Don&#x27;t understand people saying things about it.  I love it and have never had any problems.  If you run out od water because the reservior is small, refill it.  It would be hard to hold one that held a lot more water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second unit.The first lasted around a year. My hygienist noticed a significant improvement in my gum health. Bought a second unit about six months ago. This one has gotten to the point where it will not function any longer.  I love the concept, but they&#x27;ve really cheapened the product.I would be willing to pay more for a similar product with a better battery.</li>
    <li> Had this product delivered on March 15th, as of April 12th the product has ceased operation. It was charged as directed and it does not work. The product worked so well when I started, I purchased a back-up. I wonder how long this will last, I will use as a travel item only. Waterpik customer service is a joke, as I purchased another one locally and it was missing some essential items as the jets. Their customer service told me I could only find the jets at one chain, not even the one where it was originally purchased. For a product that costs so little it is cheaper to throw away. My new dentist recommended the product, now I must tell the dentist the product may be a piece of crap, putting it nicely.[[ASIN:B0002AHY6Q Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W]]</li>
    <li> Very happy with the waterpik. Easy to use and not big and bulky like some. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had one of these flossers before, but no where near the power this had.  I had to refill 2 times to get both upper and lower gums done.  Much better than the last.</li>
    <li> Bought in Oct 2012, used it once a day, failed in May 2013.  It just stopped working.  I&#x27;m going to my hygentist in August and will ask her how my teeth are, THEN I will tell her I stopped using the Water Pick.  Let&#x27;s see what she says not knowing I stopped.  I&#x27;ll just keep on with my Sonicare brush (very, very good) and hot water mouth washes followed by mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01.11.2014:  My hygentist said to continue to use a Waterpik.  I bought a 2nd one in mid August 2013.  It failed after 6 months; it will not take a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else I own lasts a long time.  Why can&#x27;t Waterpik figure this out?</li>
    <li> Pretty much what most of the reviews said.  The design is a little &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34; /ugly or I wouldn&#x27;t mind leaving it on the counter charging.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy it again</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on a recommendation by my dental professional. It really seems to get under the gums to clean. When I switched to the deep clean pik, my gums were sore for a day, but that has gone away. Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to see results in healthier gums as I continue to use the product. It did take me a few days to get used to using the product where I wasn&#x27;t splashing water on the mirror and everywhere else.</li>
    <li> Although this is the best product I have ever used to clean my teeth, the battery on this item died within two months of purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the third one of these I have had.  I use it twice a day and am very satisfied with its performance</li>
    <li> I must have purchased 3 of these. None has lasted longer than 6 months. If you use it until it needs charging, it goes strong for about 5 months, then starts to need charging more and more often, then you get nothing. I use it in the shower since it needs almost constant refilling due to the tiny reservoir.</li>
    <li> I do not know how they work since I bought 2 of these for gifts and the boxes were thin,torn,crushed and Shoddy,unlike the 2 boxes I ordered last year. Would be too embarrassed to give these as gifts. The units are scratched and don&#x27;t look new even though they are supposed to be. Will pay higher prices in stores from now on so I will know what I am getting</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these and I&#x27;m done. On the first one the power connection oxidized so that it would no longer charge. On the next one the pump gave out. Six months each was my guess at their lifespan. My third will be the Panasonic and we&#x27;ll see how that works out.&lt;br /&gt;Like others say, the battery duration is terrible and charging it is very hit and miss.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d steer clear of this product.</li>
    <li> Last year, my dentist told me to buy a Water-Pik. This model seemed to be the best buy. I&#x27;ve had a problem with charges not lasting long, but now, the power button has to be pressed repeatedly before it works, then it has to be held, as it will no longer stay on without being held. It is very hard to use this way. I can&#x27;t send it back, as I can&#x27;t find the slip. I can&#x27;t really afford to buy another one, but I can&#x27;t afford to lose my teeth, either. I hope to find a better model.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nifty gadget.  Has more velocity and water power than the original from the 70&#x27;s (yes, I&#x27;m old enough to have used one then) and it is more convenient.  The self-contained water reservior is deceptive in that it holds far more water than you would expect by looking at it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The one drawback that I would note is the need to charge it. I&#x27;m no fan of plugging in water-related devices, but the trade-off is the ability to use the charged unit in cordless mode. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Very efficient and space saving. Really good pressure choices and tips. The only downfall is it does not stay charged and you have to keep it plugged in all of the time. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised. Works well and is easy to use. Unfortunately the water reservoir is too small for a good cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time I have bought the handheld cordless WaterPik. I love it when it works. It really helps, my periodontist has really noticed a difference. The 1st one lasted about 6 months or so, the 2nd about 3 months, and this last one I bought July 6th and here it is Sept 12, and it&#x27;s ready for the trash bin. Works great when you first get it, but after the first charge wears down, it just gets weaker and weaker until it dies completely. I have followed the charging instructions to the tee, and it still died.... I really need this product, but it looks like I will have to try something else.</li>
    <li> The reservoir is too small--I had to fill it 4 times just to get the outer surface of my teeth, using it for 5 seconds/tooth space as directed. Plus you can&#x27;t maneuver this thing to clean the inner surfaces without turning it on its side---&amp; of course the water spills out or the unit can&#x27;t suck up water unless its upright. And how come nobody&#x27;s mentioning the huge mess? You have to stand over the sink with your mouth open &amp; if you happen to hit a flat surface in your mouth at the right angle---be ready to clean your mirrors alot, folks; keep a towel or two handy &amp; don&#x27;t get dressed before you use this thing. And the worst thing is---I STILL had to floss afterwards!!! This thing got a star only because there&#x27;s no option for ZERO. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do yourself &amp; your wallet a favor. Get one of those long-reach flossers with the replaceable floss. It&#x27;s much easier than regular floss. You don&#x27;t really have to change the floss unless it breaks, just rinse it well like you do your toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I gave all my children one for christmas....they are much better than dental floss and easy to take along on trips...perfect for dental crowns and bridges also.</li>
    <li> Although the price is attractive, the product is worthless. You basically get a few seconds of water before the reservoir runs out. Turn the thing off, fill it up, repeat. Endlessly. And it&#x27;s so underpowered that old fashioned floss is much more effective.</li>
    <li> Each time I tried to use the device the tip came out and fell into the sink.  Have used the standard WaterPik for over 15 years and wanted to try the sleeker looking hand held.  I will be returning it tomorrow.  I kept my old unit just in case.  Bill</li>
    <li> This is what I was looking for... a water pik that is small and out of sight and doesn&#x27;t clutter up my dressing area. Convenient, hand held, cordless dental water jet for healthy gums. I bought one for my husband and I and one for my Mom. It is so easy even she can use it. I am still tinkering with the adjustments so I don&#x27;t shoot myself in the eye or give myself and the mirror a shower, but so far I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has braces. It died within six months. I bought another one and it quited working after a few months of use too. It seemed that water somehow can get into the motor compartment and caused the damage.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Panasonic model for her and it is still working fine for 12 months so far.</li>
    <li> After buying it, I used this for 1 week during a river rafting trip. Worked well. 2 years later, I want to use it for another river rafting trip. Except the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge. AND YOU CANNOT REPLACE THE BATTERY! So I had to throw it away. THAT&#x27;S A STUPIDLY DESIGNED PRODUCT!!! Don&#x27;t waste your time, get the Panasonic unit with replaceable batteries.</li>
    <li> I love how the productct works.  However, this is my third one and the previous ones have all had battery trouble.  You cannot replace the battery yourself.  Hope they have this fixed.</li>
    <li> I had an electric (plug-in) that died after a couple of years of use.  I tried this unit and it not only operated at a fraction of the strength of the plug-in unit, the battery did not hold up for very long.  The lower power means the product does not clean plaque or get between the teeth.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this water pik, I wish I could find another. I purchased a newer model and I am not thrilled with it but this cordless rechareable pik was everything I could&#x27;ve asked for.</li>
    <li> Yes, I am throwing away my second unit now also, due to battery failure.  The unit works great, but 6 months of use on a unit before the battery fails is not a good product.  Sorry - I am trying a Panasonic now.</li>
    <li> Had my doubts, due to some reviews. For me it took a few times using it to get the hang. I have to fill it twice to do all my teeth, not a big deal. I love that I can pack in my suitcase. Does a great job, good power and easy to store.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a co-worker and it was worth the money. Great for getting food out your mouth without the mess.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. This product is easy to use and I found it to be a good low cost waterflosser.</li>
    <li> Ok so I am a slow learner but I have had three of these.  I travel all the time and have a console model at home so I wanted a portable for travel.  None of them lasted even six months.  They all quit working suddenly, as in it was working but I plugged it in to charge it and it never worked again.  This is a product that no one should buy until the vendor completely reworks the whole battery system.</li>
    <li> Used this for 2 weeks, and the tip broke off.  It is a piece of junk as far as I am concerned.  A total waste of time and money.  Going to Costco to buy a better one, and at least we can return it no questions  asked anytime with no trouble.</li>
    <li> Like the portable feature. Could be a bit stronger, but does the job.Was using the electric waterpik. Found it a chore to setup versus the cordless.</li>
    <li> no problems one charge lasted the week. bringing with me on every trip, replaces a much larger model that took batteries</li>
    <li> Son just got braces and needed a quality waterflosser, so it is a critcal item in my son&#x27;s dental care.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and protects my teeth which is very important to me.  In inexpensive way to avoid needing expensive dental work.  I would recommend this product to any and everyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this very same unit on ebay last year for $18. it does work pretty good. I just need something that has more power. with regular every day use this unit works good for about 3 months, then the rechargeable battery poops Out. it&#x27;s manufactured in china.</li>
    <li> The title of my review sums it up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible battery life and too small of a reservoir.  I purchased this at a local Walgreens and used it to help clean my braces.  This Waterpik was so frustrating, it was difficult to incorporate into my oral hygiene routine because I had to leave it plugged in.  It did not hold a charge.  I couldn&#x27;t even go more than one cleaning without having to charge it or it would lose its charge significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have too many devices to charge as is: my Sonicare, nose hair trimmer, the list goes on... I need a device that can be used a few times before having to be charged again.  The battery life on this thing is pathetic. Not to mention that this device has to be refilled at least three times to fully clean your mouth (in my experience).</li>
    <li> It works as well as all other Waterpik products however the battery is less than okay. I will get one, maybe two uses per charge, with it running out partway through. You cannot use it while it&#x27;s charging leaving you with a partially clean mouth. Love Waterpik products, just not this one.</li>
    <li> I had a prior waterpik like this one and loved it.  Having dropped it, I had to order a new one.  It has ease of use,&lt;br /&gt;does the job and I highly recommend it if you are looking for a cordless(can be recharged too) pic.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son who wear braces and it only worked the first year. I&#x27;m was disappointed. I now have to spend a lil more for a better one.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> Hard for me to handle.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. Mine lost its ability to charge after about 6 months. Put the money toward a good plug-in model.</li>
    <li> Better than what I was using before. On time delivery</li>
    <li> I got this about a year and a half ago, it was easy to set up and ready to use right away. There is a small learning curve as far as use goes, I shot water across the bathroom a few times in the beginning but figured it out pretty quick after that. I am particularly impressed with the battery life. It holds a charge for weeks at a time! I use it every day and have had perfect checkups since I started using it. I guess that says it all!</li>
    <li> Great travel flosser. Small, compact, light weight, and versatile. Water fill door could have been slightly larger, same with resuivor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my parents. They returned it because it held only a small amount of water. It wasn&#x27;t what they were looking for.</li>
    <li> Researched several retail outlets and found Amazon&#x27;s price the best. And, as usual arrived quickly. This product was exactly what I was looking for. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the portability of this waterpik.  No cords to stretch and can use it in the shower.  Seems to work as well as the big model</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt so clean at home.The vendor was prompt.</li>
    <li> I bought exactly the same on at walgreen for i believe over $50...I thought that was a big over priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for this price, it&#x27;s great value for money. It works really clean and floss very clean. I love it. You do need to refill the water a few times for the same session, but it&#x27;s no big deal. I don&#x27;t want a giant machine in my bathroom and this is a great size!</li>
    <li> OK.  Would have been nice if it held a little more water.  Great to take on vacation.</li>
    <li> I like it and it works. Need to refill water 3-4 times during one flossing session. Otherwise, it&#x27;s gentler and cleaner than using floss.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product the beginning of September, it is not even 2 weeks old and died on me.  As soon as the initial charge wore down, it would not re-charge and just don&#x27;t work.  I would have sent it back but stupidly, I threw out the original box.</li>
    <li> Works great - Size is perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> It okay, it does the job and is a nice size to sit on counter top.  Easy to clean.  Has 2 heads one is a pulse the other is soft.  Seems to hold a charge for a good ant of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m old enough to be on Social Security &amp; have never, never, before written a negative review about anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second unit I bought where the battery / charger / switch system deteriorated in about 16 months. The unit contains a flexible, bi-shape (one shape on -- one shape off), stamped metal switch that seems to either wear or loose its precise bi-shape memory. The result is that either the switch does not make sufficient contact to deliver sufficient power to the motor, or it always maintains a slight contact that drains &amp; ages the battery. Manually reshaping this \\&quot;switch\\&quot; restores proper function for a short time. But, such cold reshaping further deteriorates the metal&#x27;s shape memory and the same type of failure follows sooner &amp; sooner as additional fixes are applied.</li>
    <li> I have braces and the Waterpik seems to be the only practical way to keep them clean.  I&#x27;m also a road warrior, flying weekly, so the cordless is the only model that&#x27;s feasible.  On both of those accounts this product would get a 5-star rating.  My dentist and orthodontist both rave about my hygiene and they fit perfectly in my small carry on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve not had one last more than 3 months.  I get no warning they&#x27;re failing, they just die.  They won&#x27;t charge and I&#x27;ve never post-mortem&#x27;ed one to see what failed.  While it&#x27;s true they&#x27;re waranteed for a year, I found the warantee process more cumbersome than just buying a new one every three months.  At $26 they&#x27;re cheap enough that it&#x27;s not worth waiting more than two days for replacement.  Their pathetic lifespan is the reason for the 2 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the braces come off I&#x27;ll keep using, and trashing them.  It&#x27;s worth $8 per month to keep things this clean.  As soon as I&#x27;m unwired though, I&#x27;m through with this product and I&#x27;ll return to flossing.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Waterpik WP-360W in September 2011 and within 6 months began having problems with it holding a charge. Keeping it plugged in didn&#x27;t help and neither did letting it fully discharge before plugging it in.  It has reached the point where it will not recharge at all and is now useless.  I have other rechargeable products (i.e. a rechargeable tooth brush) that are still preforming well after 5 years. I am giving up on the Waterpik and looking at other brands.</li>
    <li> I have had Waterpiks in the past this product isn&#x27;t even worthy of the name.  I bought it because I like the cordless idea.  However, this model has a serious design flaw. It doesn&#x27;t hold enough water or any water output adjustments.  The user has to refill the Waterpik for every tooth cleaned and that&#x27;s not convenient nor is it feasible.  I used it twice and it went in the trash.  An effective Waterpik system requires an adequate water reservoir measured in cups ir ounces, not tablespoons.</li>
    <li> This  waterflosser  cleans  excellant</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through three of these in five years. Works good, wish water pressure was stronger, but dentist was happy with my last cleaning- and I don&#x27;t floss. So buying another brand since they just don&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like this product</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 6 months ago. It did a decent job at first. Then it had to be recharged more and more often--now  it won&#x27;t hold a recharge for one operation. I just tossed it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I was ready to deal with ugliness of this product for the convenience and health benefits it promised. Unfortunately, ugly is as ugly does when it comes to the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W. The power does not provide sufficient force for a proper cleaning. The reservoir barely lasts the promised 30 seconds, which woefully inadequate for a full-mouth cleaning. I can&#x27;t comment on the battery issues described in other reviews because I&#x27;m not waiting that long... the other shortcomings have sealed the (un)deal. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> i received this in the mail 2 days ago, and i love it. definitely try it out for a cheaper version of the expensive one.</li>
    <li> I have  yet to receive my water pik. I am looking forward to receiving it. Was it returned via USPS?&lt;br /&gt;Marigrace</li>
    <li> Good product. Cleans under the gums great.&lt;br /&gt;Ask you dentist if this product is right for your&lt;br /&gt;dental cleaning program.</li>
    <li> Oh my word!!!  I love this machine!  This is my second I used to hate to floss but this this is the best or I would not have bought a second!!  I absolutely love this!</li>
    <li> It came quickly...I love the increased power available with a different tip.  The travel handiness is awesome...I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> Really like getting rid of the big-footprint older version Waterpik.  Perfect size for the bathroom sink and travel.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very poor design - I regret buying it without looking up reviews.&lt;br /&gt;1. Reservoir capacity too small/cap difficult to pry open with arthritic fingers. Multiple fillings necessary.&lt;br /&gt;2. Charge lasts two flossings; second one noticeable weaker.&lt;br /&gt;3. One set of tips. That means $10 more to buy additional ones. Tip hard to maneuver. Need 2 hands: 1 to hold, 1 to rotate tip. Oops---out of water!&lt;br /&gt;4. Water stream pressure only adjustable only by changing tips.&lt;br /&gt;5. Recharger is plug-in and terminals not protected&lt;br /&gt;6. Should be recharged with inductive non contact/sealed base like my cordless Braun Sonic tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;7. I have just used it 4 times. When the battery dies (as others indicate will be soon) I will use the unit for target practice. Varmint!</li>
    <li> This is my third Waterpik.  I use it daily usually after brushing my teeth.  It does a great job of cleaning teeth and gums.  What wears it&lt;br /&gt;down after a couple of years are mineral deposits from the water.  I haven&#x27;t found a way to clean this but replacing the Waterpik is not&lt;br /&gt;costly.</li>
    <li> Yes, my Dentist recommended it and uses one himself. The high pressure nozzle is high pressure, be careful. I would NOT recommend a child use it because of the possiblity for accidents. Adults need to be aware of where it is pointing before turning it on. I find it easier to use in the shower as I don&#x27;t have to worry about the spray/splash getting all over the mirror and vanity. It does a good job. The reservoir empties pretty quickly. I prefer the low pressure tip.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product. It has very little cleaning force and holds a very small amount of water. You have to fill it several times to get a complete cleaning. After about a month&#x27;s use, it&#x27;s stream is so feeble it hardly puts out any water. Just kind of dribbles. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested I buy a Waterpik so I did. This one is so simple to use and I can really feel it getting between my teeth and a little under my gums. I have gotten into the habit of looking at Amazon.com before any other store or website, because I always find the product at a better price and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> AN EXCEPTIONAL EXAMPLE OF VERY POOR CORPORATE PERFORMANCE.  THEY COULDN&#x27;T FAIL TO KNOW THAT THE (UNREPLACABLE) NI-CAD BATTERIES OF THESE UNITS WILL FAIL VERY QUICKLY, THAT THEY COULD REPLACE THEM WITH NI-mh FOR LITTLE OR NO EXTRA EXPENSE.  THIS IS A COMPANY THAT CLEARLY DOESN&#x27;T CARE ABOUT IT&#x27;S CUSTOMERS.  INFURIATING!</li>
    <li> I needed 60 seconds of rinse time. would not recommend for kids under 16.&lt;br /&gt;Well made except pricy for function.</li>
    <li> So, I am on my 2nd one of these... and if there were another kind out there that is portable like this size.. I would have tried that for my second one. The first one died on me right before I took off on vacation, and I had only had it for about 4-5 months. The motor just stopped working. Dunzo. Waterpik has a warranty on their products, but when I went to the website, I needed information I didn&#x27;t have on me... and time just kept passing and I eventually just bought a new one. There is a button to eject the applicator, and two other buttons to turn on and off. Sometimes, my finger will slip and not hit the off button when I think its going to and I end up squirting water everywhere. Not really a fan...</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Small enough not to be an eyesore on the bathroom sink.  Also portable to be used in the shower.  Has enough power to clean gums  well.  I charge it once a week and use it about once a day.  I would have given it 5 stars, except for two negatives:  I don&#x27;t like the fact that the battery is not replaceable, and have read other reviews about how after a year or so of use, you have to throw it out.  I don&#x27;t like disposable, and would have preferred to pay a couple of more bucks and have a battery I could replace.  Also, you have about 30 seconds to do your whole mouth before the water well empties, so unless you want to take the time to refill mid mouth, you have to move pretty quick around your gums.  I bought three more of these for my adult kids, and they&#x27;re all really happy with them.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for another Waterpik which after several years of service would no longer work.  I liked the first I had and so far this works well.  It does a good job of cleaning between teeth.</li>
    <li> It works better than I expected!  It got here on time and preforms well.  Have only had to charge it once so far.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this product from Amazon, for I found it at a somewhat lower price at a local store. But I wanted to write a review anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this flosser for about a month, and it is very adequate though not quite  up to expectations. The main problem is that it has to be recharged  more often than the advertising  implies. I use it twice a day and need to recharge it about every third day. It does not run down completely before I recharge it, but when it slows down I plug it in again, overnight. Another problem, as several reviewers have said, is that the reservoir does not hold enough water for a thorough cleaning. I usually fill it twice. But THIS IS NOT BAD. I would rather do this than try to handle a larger, more awkward machine. So far as cleaning is concerned, I think it does a very good job. I have just used the less powerful jet, but the first time I used it I got more stuff out than I with a previous flossing. Ever since then I have used the waterpik before flossing, and have not found any residue when I later flossed. One strange but inconsequential thing is that even though I fill the reservoir with warm water, the first water to come out  when you turn it on is cool. I would like to know why.</li>
    <li> Our previous water pick/flosser worked beautifully for at least 10 years; due to a domestic accident it got ruined.  We bought a WP 360w from a local retailer as a replacement.  What a dud.  You have to charge the battery for 24 hours, unlike my rechargeable toothbrush, there no little light to tell you that the unit is charging or when it is fully charged, or when it needs to be recharged.  After 24 hours charging, I plugged it in and tried it.  The motor running at full tilt is pathetically weak and the water stream barely perceptible compared to our old, plug in model.  Unlike the old plug in model, you cannot adjust the strength of the water flow.  Moreover, the water tank only holds about 4 oz. so you have to stop and refill it several times.  We took this dud back to the retailer.  What a piece of junk.  Surprised that a company like Waterpik which wants to keep its reputation would keep this on the market.  Are you listening, Water Pik?  Take this piece of junk off the market.  Bet you have a warehouse full of returned units!!</li>
    <li> This product worked well for about 2 weeks.  They sent me another one that lasted about 1.5 years.  When this one quit I sent it to the factory for repairs.  Optimistic perhaps.  Water Pik sent it back immediately telling me it was no longer under warranty.  I knew that, but expect things to last a little longer or at least be repairable.  They further explained that they don&#x27;t service any of their products.  On principle I&#x27;m disappointed that they expect you to just toss this item after its short life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a recycler so I got out my screwdrivers, pry tools, and pliers to break it down into plastics and metal.  This took about 20 minutes and specialty screwdrivers - tiny ones a watchmaker might use.  Of further concern is that buried inside (inaccessible and unknown to consumers) is a fancy battery with a notice that says clearly \\&quot;do not dispose in municipal trash\\&quot; - or something to that effect.  Don&#x27;t remember if there was any warning about this in the product manual, but even if there were, who are they kidding?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth it for the dental value, but consumers should look into other options.  I encourage Water Pik to work on these end game issues.</li>
    <li> This is my second. Yes, the battery isn&#x27;t replaceable so when it stops charging you have to buy another. But the price is modest and the item is excellent. It cleans my teeth really, really well. The first probably saved me its price in floss, because I used to use a yard of floss, and after first cleaning my teeth with the waterpik, a small bit of floss is plenty and the floss always comes out clean anyway. But the real cost savings is, of course, dentistry. This is just an excellent, convenient, efficient, moderately priced product. I wouldn&#x27;t be without one now. I wish I&#x27;d replaced the first sooner, because the battery was poor for a while, and I had to recharge it every day. Now, I&#x27;ve charged it once and it&#x27;s lasted over a week. Brilliant product.</li>
    <li> Am so glad I got this instead of the full size.  It works great.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Already bought three in one year. This product is very effective in flossing, unfortunately, the on-switch quits in a few months.</li>
    <li> Since I got my implants I never felt that dental floss got into the crevices of the implant.  This waterflosser is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I leave it in the wall just like my cell phone.  I don&#x27;t mind filling it up a couple of times to do my teeth.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s portable.  I have a plug in unit at home which holds more water because of that.  Overall, I just love it.  If you are expecting more, get a plug in unit and carry it around with you!  And, you can&#x27;t be the price.  I have had mine for 5 years and it still works!</li>
    <li> It is effective at removing tartar and plaque. Maybe not as good as flossing but a lot more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir seems a bit small for getting between all of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I have to keep it plugged in constantly or the battery will not stay charged enough to be always ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;A state of charge indicator would be very helpful.</li>
    <li> Now that I have a small &#x27;bridge&#x27; in my mouth I really needed this water flosser.  It travels nicely with me, where ever I go. It works great &amp;  arrived as scheduled.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Better checkups at the dentist since using this. Quick, convenient and freshens my breath. Add a drop of Tea Tree Oil to the water for good dental health.  My only issue is that the pic part of it is not removable - I broke it off when traveling and had to replace the whole unit. I use it two or three times a day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and cheap but after a year of casual use it is now completely dead. To the trash it goes and now I&#x27;ll be searching for another.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews of this product while searching for an answer about a broken tip. Some have issues /w it but for the price I think you can&#x27;t go wrong. I bought it last summer for my daughter who has some dexterity problems so cannot use regular floss. It is very convenient for her &amp; allows her to keep her gums healthy &amp; I might mention we have tried just about every method of flossing on the market. Last night it fell on the hard wood floor &amp; the tip that was in it broke even with the insertion point so when I couldn&#x27;t find an answer regarding ejection of the tip, but had however found someone who responded regarding the warranty &amp; how easy it had been for them to have the company replace theirs so I decided to call the company. My experience /w them could not have been better they were polite, easy to understand my problem &amp; walked me through the VERY easy fix. Fortunately I did have the &amp;#34;hex screw driver&amp;#34; required after that it was easy. I had already posted that question here so was going to answer it for others in my predicament but the system wouldn&#x27;t allow me to answer my own question so here are the instructions I received: insert the hex screw driver into the broken off portion until it&#x27;s tight then THERE IS a release button just above the on/off button which another reviewer had made reference to but apparently it only works if you have something longer in the tip area like another tip or in my case the screw driver, anyway after I had the screw driver in place all I had to do was push the eject button! To those who say the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge, we are fortunate enough to have an outlet near my daughter&#x27;s vanity/sink &amp; we leave it plugged in unless she&#x27;s using it. Actually, I thought that was what the instructions indicated you should do however having lost those I cannot say for certain just that it works for us.</li>
    <li> THE WATERPICK QUIT WORKING AFTER 3 MONTHS. I CONTACTED WATERPICK AND AND THEY SAID THAT THE ITEM WAS ALREADY OUT OF DATE (ACCORDING TO THE SERIAL NUMBER). WATER PICK SAID THAT THEY WOULD REPLACE THE ITEM</li>
    <li> have used my waterpik for years no problems&#x3D;  my 3rd purchase. use it when I travel have had goog luck with item</li>
    <li> Great item and promptly sent.</li>
    <li> I have a history of bad teeth, so anything that will help fight infections and aid cleanliness is welcome.  This rechargeable waterpick is great for home use or traveling.  Put a splash of hydrogen peroxide in the water and you have a powerful tool for better dental health.  The only criticism I have is, no matter how diligent I was about recharging the batteries, after less than a year, it no longer held a charge.  I tried to make sure the terminals where the plug goes in were dry, but it still lost power. The water stream gets so weak it no longer has the cleaning power to be effective. Other than that, it is a great unit, and since I bought a second one, I would obviously recommend it.</li>
    <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;very helpful&lt;br /&gt; works fine&lt;br /&gt; I recommend this water pick to everybody who wants to take a good care about his tees</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate this.  There&#x27;s nothing actually wrong with it.  I needed a Waterpik to take on frequent trips because using the standard plug-in model is working wonders for my dental health.  The plus side is a smaller unit I can pack in my luggage.  But it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the power of the bigger units and I feel the charge doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should, it has to be held upright when operating, which is awkward when I&#x27;m using it on my bottom teeth, the tendency is to tilt it sideways at times.  I have to refill the small water reservoir to do a thorough cleaning.  The up side is it&#x27;s portable and better than nothing when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Gets the job done quickly and efficiently.  I would recommend this product to friends and family.  Great in the shower!</li>
    <li> I already own a waterpik and got this as a gift for someone else. I have used mine for 5 years and it is still going strong, and was recommended it after i broke my jaw and had it wired shut as a way to keep my mouth clean. Worked wonders and use it to this day. Combine this with an electrical tooth brush and you mouth is golden.. I have yet to have a cavity, and every time i go to the dentist they commend how healthy my teeth and gums are. I highly recommend it. The only downside is that it usually takes two full fills to do my entire mouth. I find that not a huge deal personally. I recommend to clean it, about twice a month, fill it with mouth wash and use it. Also the waterpik is great to use after you have coffee to get rid of the bad breath. Great product and helped me when I really needed it and can not recommend it enough</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this online at Amazon but bought it just tonight from a pharmacy here in Trinidad &amp; Tobago after agonizing about a tonsil stone I had; i read reviews online that stated, that this was a good product to buy to remove them.  However, nowhere did i read online, BEFORE buying the Waterpik that the force of the water would slash my throat...yep! it did.  I guess i was just so willing to try anything to remove the tonsil stone that i didn&#x27;t do much research about the possible dangers of misuse!  I still give it 5 stars because it effectively removed my tonsil stone and i was desperate at the time because i hadn&#x27;t kissed my new boyfriend in 2 days because this nasty tonsil stone gave me bad breath!!  I&#x27;ll certainly be doing some kissing tomorrow!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s handy for packing and carrying for traveling. The water capacity is just enough to clean my teeth in a filling.</li>
    <li> Good quality product; does the job and perfect for travel, though a bit bulky to hold. Will be appreciated for travel.</li>
    <li> This portable waterpick waterflosser is everything I anticipated it would be.  Now I can travel and continue with my oral hygene program that I follow at home.</li>
    <li> After only a few months of use the battery in the Waterpik was unable to take and hold a charge.  I called the Waterpik people and discussed the problem.  After a very pleasant conversation, I was told that I would be sent a replacement Waterpik.  It arrived a few days later and it works well.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and portable enough to take when traveling.  My oral hygienist suggested I get one to use in addition to brushing and flossing.  I no longer have gums that bleed easily and the waterpik cleans well under my permanent bridge.  Recommended for anyone wanting healthier gums.</li>
    <li> My original waterpik broke and I replaced it with this one since it&#x27;s a little smaller and easier to handle and hold. It is perfect and I love it even more than the original waterpik flosser!! Highly recommend this!!</li>
    <li> The unit worked fine for about 15 months. Then it began being unreliable by not starting or pumping slower than it should. My problem turned out to be the switch. It had become corroded with green \\&quot;rust\\&quot;, copper oxide. By removing the flexible metal switch component by removing two small screws, I was able to use a fingernail file to remove the corrosion both on the copper strip and the contact on the flexible metal strip. Now it works like new. Probably what happened over the months of multiple daily uses, water leaked in to the unit at the base of the tip. I never remove the tip except for occasional cleaning. The unit came apart with some difficulty after removing the two screws in the base. When I took the unit apart the inside had a lot of brown \\&quot;slime\\&quot;, which was easily rinsed off with the help of a retired toothbrush. By the way, thinking that the battery might be the problem, I Googled the number on the side of the battery and ended up at batteryspace.com where there was a battery for $9.95 that looked like it would work. It is marketed for electric razors. But I did not need it, at least not yet.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist so I bought it through Amazon. Less expensive than if I had the dentist order it! Great product. Really makes your mouth feel clean</li>
    <li> No problems, everything was as expected.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am very unhappy that the charge did not remain. I purchased it, went on a trip and it lasted about 2 chargings.  I COULD NOT RETURN IT BECAUSE I WAS OUT OF TOWN.  NOW I CANNOT GET MY MONEY BACK.  SO I LOST OUT.  [[ASIN:B0002AHY6Q Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W]]</li>
    <li> Worked fine for a year or so.  The pressure started to decrease shortly after that.  Will not turn on after about a year and a half.</li>
    <li> I bought this to bring with me on my vacation and it leaks. I have not had a chance to call and complain about this problem. May be the person reading the reviews can help me out. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t last a year before it completely quit working. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I can hear it running but nothing comes out. There isn&#x27;t any way to clean it out. I won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
    <li> Worked for about a week then wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. Wish I had read the other reviews first! Don&#x27;t even try it!</li>
    <li> When I bought this I thought this would be a great product. It is. We really love it to clean our teeth. However I must admit that I agree with many other reviewers that the battery live is very very short. I keep recharging it as it is low after a few (sometimes two) uses. Hopefully the manufacturer can improve on the battery. Also an indicator would be very helpful.</li>
    <li> The waterpik flosser is a great asset in keeping gums and teeth in great condition. This item was  recommended for maintaining good dental health.&lt;br /&gt;Response and mailing were also quite prompt.  Thanks for this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee Phillips</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a manual irrigation syringe after tooth extraction.  The blue pik is for low pressure and the clear pik is for high.  However, there really isn&#x27;t all that much a noticeable difference between the two pressures.  Either pik I used, both were too powerful for my gums and caused them to bleed.  That&#x27;s my fault, my dissolvable stitches are only 6 days old and my dentist specifically told me to avoid trauma to my gums and sockets.  I probably would have been better off with the larger unit which has more discriminating levels of water pressure, but I&#x27;m on the road a lot for work so the portability factor won me over.  I think this unit would be perfect for someone who has a healthy mouth, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone who still is recovering from dental surgery... too much water pressure.  Mix in a capful of mouthwash into the reservoir (I use the kind with hydrogen peroxide for the whitening effect) and you save yourself one less hygiene task.  It takes about two tanks to do a thorough cleaning, which is perfect because I use warm tap water for the first pass and a mix of tap and mouthwash for the second.</li>
    <li> this is the second waterpik waterflosser rechargeable I have purchased. I was going on an extended vacation and didn&#x27;t want to take my big waterpik. The first one I had only worked a few months and by the time I realized it had a longer warranty we  had tried to replace the battery because it wouldn&#x27;t retain a charge. Anyway I figured it was a one time problem, but this new one I purchased stopped holding a charge within two months, I was on my vacation and unable to use it.  I would not reccommend purchasing one, stick with the original plug in.  I will be contacting waterpik about the product</li>
    <li> This item is very efficient.  I use it every day, and it always does a very good job.  I am extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This cordless rechargable waterflosser was ok but we find it very noisy when in operation .&lt;br /&gt;But i guess it will work ok when we travel and for short uses .</li>
    <li> This Waterpik was recommended by my dentist.  I must admit it took some getting used to at first.  I found it difficult to judge the water pressure when used the first time.  I had water all over my counter top and mirror lol.  That was my fault, not the Waterpik&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using a few times, I got used to the water pressure and am now very happy with it.  I recommend it to anyone who wants a water flosser.  However, my dentist advised that I floss in the usual manner along with the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my husband. He has been out of the country for several months so did not use it until March 2, 2014. It leaks terribly when you turn the power switch on and the water pressure is not strong at all.  Now it is too late to return!  Such a waste of money!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product is in use every day and have very little difficulties with it. Yes I would recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using Waterpik Waterflossers for maybe 20 years - or as long as they&#x27;ve been around. I have one on my bathroom sink and one for travel.  They do the job, except my experience has been that the cable goes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this one because the cable went out on one of my old ones.  I think the cordless are easier to use than the regular and easier to fill and rinse out.  There is another cordless model that holds more and the water holder can be taken off.  That model leaks for me.  So I am sticking with this model.  Occasionally I will have to add more water if something is stuck in my teeth, but usually one tank is fine.</li>
    <li> this product is convienient to use and for first time in years my dentist said I had greatly improved since my last cleaning.  he asked what changed because it was quite dramatic in only 4 months since last cleaning.  the only negative thing about this is it only lasted a year before it would no longer hold charge and becomes useless.  coincidentally the warranty is also a year.  so plan on buying one every year as I&#x27;m on my 2nd but for price it&#x27;s well worth it compared to the dental expense and pain I wouldn&#x27;t have had to endure if I had started using this years ago..  I had a waterpick years ago because it was a hassle to use and made mess all over sink but this one can be used in shower and it doesn&#x27;t take up half bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Used it and liked it. For what I paid it paid for itself and then some before it finally died. My last one lasted just over 2 years. Sometimes it got finicky and didn&#x27;t put out good pressure. Needed to charge for a good long time after use before I could use it again. Was going to buy another one but seen I could get the traditional Waterpick (WP-72) for less money and eliminate my dependency on waiting for batteries to charge. Much better choice if you&#x27;re like me and like constant power, more power, and a large reservoir. It has been a small challenge getting use to something with a small &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34; with a small hose attached. But the benefits out way any inconvenience I&#x27;ve had adjusting.</li>
    <li> Quit working in about a month</li>
    <li> Plugged it in.. waited the specified 24 (!) hours before I could use it. Didn&#x27;t work. There was a motor spinning somewhere inside it, but no water came out, at least out of the end of the nozzle where it was supposed to. The reservoir leaks all over the place out of both the top and bottom. It&#x27;s too long to fill conveniently in a typical bathroom sink. After reading the other reviews here about what further problems lay down the road if I were to get a functioning unit, I&#x27;m not even going to bother getting a replacement.</li>
    <li> Lot bigger than I expected but does the job</li>
    <li> A very practical device.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have owned.  These work great and make your whole mouth feel fresh.  My dentist likes it too.</li>
    <li> I bought this waterflosser because I got braces, and it is great to properly clean teeth and braces and dislodge food (sorry,but that is the reality of braces!). The reservoir is just enough for the whole mouth, up and down, front and back.&lt;br /&gt;However, the battery is awful. The first month the charge would last about a week, and progressively it was shorter and shorter, and after 4 months it would last 2 days (which means the 2nd day the flow is weak). Now it&#x27;s been 4 and 1/2 months and I had to throw it away: a full night charge doesn&#x27;t even last for 1 cleaning session, i.e. 45 seconds!  That is really a scandal, now that batteries are very efficient. The battery in my electric toothbrush is more than 1 year old and each charging lasts 2 months (and I have been cleaning my teeth more than twice a day because of my braces).&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t buy it at Amazon but I wanted to give this feedback.</li>
    <li> Runs out of water very quickly! Have to refill about 6 times to get job done! Convenient that you are not attached to wall but only one setting for strength of jet stream, next time lid go with corded plug in larger resvoir.</li>
    <li> Not enough pressure but sure is handy and space-saving.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of cleaning the  teeth after brushing.</li>
    <li> I guess I can say this was a good starter waterflosser but I probably would have been better off spending a little more for quality.  It&#x27;s been less than a year and it will no longer hold a charge.  I have to basically keep it plugged in all the time so I can use it in the morning.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t take up much space and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Too heavy and it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water</li>
    <li> First of all the tip keeps flying off.  So, since I have to fix almost everything that I don&#x27;t have to invent myself I drilled a small hole into the part that holds the tip in and put a small screw in it to hold it in.  Second of all, the water jet is way too powerful and causes bleeding gums and pain.  So, to fix and invent away this problem myself, since I always wanted to be an expert in all the products I pay other people for, I cut the cotton ends off a plastic Q-tip and jammed it into the tip as a flow restrictor and this makes the thing actually usable.  The shape of the thing and the cap makes it really difficult to fill the reservoir from our fairly standard sink, and you have to fill it at least once during a &amp;#34;flossing.&amp;#34;  If you can&#x27;t fix and invent solutions like this YMMV and it may be completely useless to you.</li>
    <li> Thanks Great product wireless.</li>
    <li> As has been the experience of other reviewers, I have gone through three of the Waterpik WP-360s now. In each case, the unit fails to charge after some time. The first one failed in a few months after purchase and Waterpik sent me a new unit. This one failed just outside the warranty period. The third one was a gift from my brother, so I did not have a receipt, and I did not open it immediately. Once, I did, it worked on the first trip, but after sitting there for a month and a half it would not charge and does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Contacted waterpik and they ask for the receipt (dont have) and they indicate that based on the serial number this is out of warranty. They graciously offered me a $10 coupon to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;However, given the experience I am unlikely to get another one.&lt;br /&gt;The small reservoir volume is also a deterrent as noted by others, as is the inability to get a decent pressure from it, even with the high pressure nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a plug in kind of waterpik for about 6 years and it has worked reasonably well -- the hose connecting the tank to the nozzle started leaking and had to be replaced. Lately it seems to be making noise and may be about to die, but given that it has lasted so long, I am satisfied with that product.</li>
    <li> I like aterpik products but this is so poorly designed I am throwing it away.  First of all, you can&#x27;t fill the water reservoir in a normal bathroom sink.  It is too tall to get under the faucet.  So, you would have to fill it in a sink that has a high necked faucet or you would have to fill it using a cup or bottle of water.  As this is a travel item, that is very inconvenient.  Second, you are instructed to keep the unit upright while using.  That is impossible as you would want to turn it around curves gum lines in your mouth. I bought this as I am planning some extensive road trips but it really isn&#x27;t even much of a space saver either.  I wouldn&#x27;t accept this as a gift.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Looses charge quickly</li>
    <li> Not sure how I lived without this portable waterpik. I love it.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and works fine</li>
    <li> The tank doesn&#x27;t hold enough water, the power runs out quickly, and the battery wears out within weeks. You can&#x27;t replace the battery. Garbage</li>
    <li> This model is very powerful which is good, but it does not hold enough water.  Also, the on/off buttons are a little difficult to manage when it is on and being used.</li>
    <li> I take this on vacation. It does work but: you must hold the unit upright or it quits squirting, makes it hard to maneuver into tight spots. You have to turn move your head -not the squirter: Runs out of water fast, and because you have to hold it upright the stuff from your mouth is cascading all over the device.</li>
    <li> The top rotates around, so that i cannot direct the flow of water where i want it to go.&lt;br /&gt;And I have to fill it up too often- the reservoir is too small. Not happy at all with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Works great.  I was surprised by what was removed even after brushing with the water pik. It can be messy until you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I got it at my dentist&#x27;s recommendation and because otherwise I would have to use 2 kinds of string floss: 1 for tight spaces and the other for the wide spaces in my teeth.  It takes a little bit of time to get used to the &#x27;tickly&#x27; feel and to aim the darn thing correctly, but after a little practice everything is going well and I feel that I&#x27;m seeing improvement in my gums. I HOPE the dentist sees the same by the next check-up.</li>
    <li> Had to find the solution to my lack of flossing and this tool is great for those of us who hate to floss..</li>
    <li> Tip sometimes gets clogged and getting it cleaned out can be tedious. Perhaps it should come with a cleaning tool</li>
    <li> I have had a Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, which was great, until it started leaking everywhere after a year&#x27;s use.  Then, I got a new flosser through Amazon from ToiletTree Products, which only lasted two weeks before it stopped working.  Now, I have the Waterpik Cordless model, and am underwhelmed.  The pressure is too low, so it doesnt do the job it&#x27;s supposed to, the reservoir is too small, so I have to fill it twice for one clean (and I dont dilly daddle around).  The model is also bulky and difficult to hold properly.  I wish I could take this one back!</li>
    <li> This water-pik is terrible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to refill it FOUR times just to QUICKLY cover all 4 quadrants of my mouth.  SMALL reservoir!  If you want to do a thorough job, you&#x27;re going to be refilling it all morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The filling orifice is so small that you will overrun it unless you turn the tap down to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s taller than the height of my faucet.  I have to tilt it awkwardly just to get the opening under my faucet.  Your faucet may be taller and not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no adjustment on the pressure.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tilt it while using it, the water stops.  You have to keep the darned thing straight up in order to use it, meaning that you are drooling all over it and your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The socket for the charger is on the handle, meaning that when you&#x27;re washing it off after you&#x27;ve drooled all over it, you&#x27;re getting water in the socket.  To be safe, I&#x27;m waiting till the water in the socket dries before I plug it in to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re using it, you&#x27;re holding the entire device, not just a spigot.  It feels too clunky in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d bought it in a store so it would be easy to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use it only until I buy a better model.  Then it&#x27;s going to be relegated to my suitcase just so I&#x27;ll have _something_ for when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY...</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Cleans teeth very good. I use it every day. Great product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 52 year old retired Marine so you would have thought I&#x27;d be smart enough to read reviews FIRST.  Noooooo, not me! I&#x27;ve heard the Waterpik name my whole life it seems which meant I was comfortable buying one.  What a waste of money!  Suzanne Sommers once said \\&quot;why do I need a waterpik, I have a shower\\&quot;.  She was right! Get a shower head with the adjustable nozzle and you&#x27;ll get two or three streams that will outshine a waterpik any day!  How sad is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: none&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Reservoir is too small; (use/refill, use/refill, use/refill use/refill)&lt;br /&gt;  Must use in the shower; unless you&#x27;re washing your floor at the same time&lt;br /&gt;  NOT THAT STRONG; Two wands come with it....shower twice as strong&lt;br /&gt;  $35 dollars down the drain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe me? Just do this one thing: KEEP YOUR RECEIPT IN YOUR WALLET, you&#x27;ll need it after the first time you use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I&#x27;ve seen the \\&quot;large\\&quot; units with tubes and bigger reservoirs.....does not negate the un-powerful, messy points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I honestly don&#x27;t know how this company is in business let alone a booming business?&lt;br /&gt;Remember: Adjustable shower head :)</li>
    <li> I BARELY USED IT ON INFREQUENT TRIPS AND STOPPED CHARGING.  MADE MISTAKE TO BUY IT AGAIN.  USED IT MAY BE 100 TIMES AND POOPED OUT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> just what i was looking for</li>
    <li> I was more than bummed to see so many poor reviews as we&#x27;ve loved our waterpik! It does an amazing job and am very anxious and hopeful to see what my daughter&#x27;s orthodontist thinks at her next checkup.  My daughter is merely seven years old, and asking her to floss, especially with brackets, springs, and wires all over her teeth seems almost unreasonable.  I hope this pik is doing the job because it certainly feels and looks like it is!</li>
    <li> The tip gets clogged sometimes and it&#x27;s hard to wash it. When the tip is clogged you&#x27;re supposed to soak it in vinegar or buy a new one, the customer service blames it on the tip.  I cleaned the micro particle that was blocking the tip&#x27;s opening with a very think wire and it worked for a while, but now even though the tip is clean it stopped working.  It&#x27;s good for a once in a while travel use but not for regular use. I suppose you should get the bigger version of it for long use.  You don&#x27;t get much time out of te travel size.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Dental floss is better and more accurate cleaning, too.</li>
    <li> I use the regular (full-size) Waterpik at home, but bought this one for travel. Wasn&#x27;t nuts about its small capacity (had to refill it at least 3 or 4 times each time I used it) and the fact that it had only one pressure setting, but couldn&#x27;t bring the full-sized one, so I got this one. Well, as some other reviewers stated, it had to be held pretty much upright for it to work, so that was awkward but do-able. LESS THAN ONE WEEK after I started using it (after having followed the charging instructions to a T), it stopped working!! I thought initially that maybe I hadn&#x27;t let it charge enough (3-4 hrs) after the initial charge, so I let it charge overnight but it STILL held minimal (and not enough to use it) charge. I then charged it for a longer period overnight, and now it&#x27;s pretty much DEAD!! Definitely not useable at all - WHAT A PIECE OF CR*P!!</li>
    <li> The Waterpic flosser is handy and a good value for the price. It&#x27;s a bit messy but most of these types of products are. The only problem I have had is the on-off switch, otherwise good buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a long visit with my son, three months.  It did not even last three months.  No longer works, there should be a better product out there.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0002AHY6Q Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT 09/17 AND RECEIVED IT 9/28/12. I STARTED TO USE THE FLOSSER THE NEXT DAY. NOW, HOWEVER THE FLOSSER WILL NOT RECHARGE OR HOLD A CHARGE AS OF NOV 01, 2012. ALSO IT DOES NOT HOLD ENOUGH FLUID TO COMPLETELY FLOSS MY TEETH. I HAVE USED WATERPIK PRODUCTS FOR MANY YEARS AND I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. AFTER READING SEVERAL REVIEWS I SEE NO POINT IN TRYING ANOTHER UNIT OF THE SAME PRODUCT. WHY THROW GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD?</li>
    <li> Fine product, second time around. First one lasted 10+ years!</li>
    <li> Great water flosser. Cordless makes it easy to floss at the sink or in the shower. Hold charge for about a week. Takes up very little space, I leave it on the countertop.</li>
    <li> needs more power for cleaning</li>
    <li> I really Liked this product for convience and the strong flow. Unfortuntly didn&#x27;t last as long a my last one. This ones plug and cord where the thing differnt from my last one which lasted about 18 months this one lasted about 8 months. The one off switch no longer clicked.</li>
    <li> excelent just love it</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0002AHY6Q Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W]]This product does not last.  The first one lasted 9 months and then would not charge. I made the mistake of buying another and this one lasted 3 months.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Great LIttle Pix and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> The waterpik works great. I had one for years and it finally bit the dust.So I ordered this one.  So far no complaints.</li>
    <li> great idea, but needs to be recharged almost after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like using the Waterpik, but after just a few months, this unit fails to hold a charge and finally dies.  I then need&lt;br /&gt;to purchase a new unit.  I now have had four of these and the same thing happens with every unit I&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t care about having to purchase a new one every few months, this unit is for you, otherwise don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love. This. Waterflosser.</li>
    <li> Very Dissapointed. I have my second Waterflosser  for a year and a half now and the battery will not charge up. The same thing happened to the previous one. When i called customer service they said you have to  plug in and charge it after every seven uses and make sure it is plugged in at other times so you do not lose the charge.She explained that all this is &amp;#34;in the book&amp;#34; and I should have known this. I am sorry but I cannot revolve my life around their waterflosser rules as it is at the bottom of my list. Nor, can I remember to count to the seventh usage rule. Do not buy this. It does not last.</li>
    <li> This a leaking, 40-dollar piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I bought this cordless rechargeable Waterpik because I planned on doing a lot of travel.  I used the standard Waterpik for many years and prefer it because it has adjustable pressure and because manipulating the pik is very easy and comfortable.  This Waterpik is awkward to use, but I don&#x27;t have space for the standard type also, so I will continue to use it.  It works well for travel.  However, it is impossible to get all of the water out.  I store it in a zip-lock bag when I travel and the inside of the bag is always wet when I open it up.  I am happy to be able to use the Waterpik 100% of the time and not just when I am home.</li>
    <li> We bought this for our daughter as she has braces and needed something that she could use to help aid in cleaning those teeth when brushing wasn&#x27;t enouogh.  It&#x27;s small so it doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of room.  It really works well, and I feel like it was a good deal for the price.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> works great...so nice for traveling.</li>
    <li> grandson with braces loves it</li>
    <li> this thing works just fine,</li>
    <li> Handy because of size.  It does not have as much power as the larger model with the tank.  Also does not hold as much water.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible to use. I need a waterpik to clean under my implants and this thing is so bulky and unwieldly that I gave up after smashing it into my cheeks until my face was sore. Although I was intrigued by the cordless device, I had to go back to the one with the cord and an extendable and adjustable piece.</li>
    <li> My mother has other 2 waterpik models. This one she loves the most.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for travel. First charge takes a day.</li>
    <li> This item is very cumbersome to use due to its long body. Also due to its long body, it can not be placed directly under the sink faucet. This requires you to use another device to obtain water in, and then transfer that water into the pick. Also the pick itself moves around when being used instead of remaining stationary. I have tried to obtain new water picks from a retail store and can not find a replacement pick. Overall this product does not live up to its advertisement. This item needs to be taken off the market and reworked.</li>
    <li> Unit doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for long, and the longer you own it the more often it has to be recharged.  After about a year, it just won&#x27;t hold a charge &amp; is useless.</li>
    <li> This waterflosser is slimmer and more user friendly than the one we previously had.  Use it every day!  Good product.</li>
    <li> I have many crowns on m y teeth and it is imperative that I keep the gums healthy-floss sometimes irritates my gums when I get too vogorous and the pik is a gentler but useful way to augment the care. I find this model easy to use, store and less cumbersome than the older styles.ALso travels well!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t get the negative reviews of this product. I really love mine and wouldn&#x27;t be without it. In fact after reading the negative reviews here I bought TWO MORE of them because I was afraid that the company might feel discouraged and pull them from the market. You are not supposed to leave it plugged into the charger at all times like many here are doing. You are supposed to let it run down and then charge it back up instead. You&#x27;ll get a longer life out of the batteries that way. I&#x27;ve had mine for about three years now and it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say that it&#x27;s an awkward design. I don&#x27;t agree at all. It&#x27;s very slim and ergonomic. I love the way it works, looks and feels. So what if it has a small reservoir. This is a PORTABLE unit. Simply refill it. It takes only seconds to do so. There&#x27;s another model that has a reservoir that is about twice as big and yeah, THAT one is awkward. I find that just one filling of the reservoir is plenty though once you get the hang of it. Every once in a while I&#x27;ll fill the reservoir with 3% Hydrogen Peroxide Solution and floss with that instead of just plain water so as to kill any bacteria between my teeth and around my gums. It says right on the label that you can gargle with it so why not? You can dilute it with 50% water if you want to be cautious. I&#x27;m very pleased with this Water Flosser.</li>
    <li> Lets see, 30 seconds flossing, or 3 minutes spilling water, spraying the bathroom walls, and multiple refills for a unit that is so cumbersome it hardly fits in my sink?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why does the on switch work that way? Press it on, and when you release, it should turn off. The first time I turned it on it locks on and I&#x27;m getting sprayed with water while I turn it off. Who designs something like that? Did the designers even use it? Once I tried to press the button to release the tip, and I turned it on and sprayed the ceiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing will sit in my closet until the day I get a bridge of crown that requires it, till then, I can floss 4 times in the amount of time it takes to use this thing once.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately bought this somewhere else but it is worthless!! Wish I had read the reviews first..like everyone else it didn&#x27;t keep a charge and now won&#x27;t recharge. About 4 months for me..do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I&#x27;m still in the process of learning how to ues the flosser. No matter which tip I use I end up with a face full of water. If I place the flosser tip in my closed mouth then turn it on I don&#x27;t get a face full of water, however I also can&#x27;t tell which teeth I can floss. I guess with practice I&#x27;ll eventually get the hang of how to use it without spraying my face.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the Waterpik, saying that, over the long term, it would improve the health of my gums. That would be a definite PRO for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never find out if she was right because the product stopped working exactly one week after the expiration of the one-year warranty, thereby making it an expensive piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait, there&#x27;s more . . . all of them CONS. This product offers one of the least \\&quot;friendly\\&quot; user experiences you could imagine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Terrible ergonomics - hard to hold (especially when wet) because of the slick plastic surface and a design that doesn&#x27;t fit in the hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No indicator lights - no way to know if the thing is charged, charging (when plugged in), or even working (unless water is squirting out, which mine stopped doing about 370 days into its lifespan)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Antique battery technology - remember back in the 1990s when you had to drain your cell phone battery all the way before recharging it? Well, welcome back to 1995, because this product uses the same battery technology, but without any user feedback on battery status&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The battery holds a decent charge for about 2-3 days and then declines rapidly for another 3-4 days, which means that (1) you can&#x27;t recharge it until it&#x27;s fully drained BUT (2) the product doesn&#x27;t operate under full power after the third day. Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that the Philips Sonicare Airfloss is a vastly superior product and will check it out - but no more Waterpiks in this household.</li>
    <li> I really like the product, it works great and I would recommend it. But is has a major flaw...the reservoir only lasts for seconds. the description states you&#x27;re getting about a 30 second use (which isn&#x27;t very long to begin with), but it&#x27;s not keeping that promise. The reservoir empties VERY quickly, you will find yourself refilling it several times just to get to floss your whole mouth once. It is frustrating to say the least...it seems like you just pushed the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button and you&#x27;re already on empty...invest in a product with a larger reservoir and save yourself the hassle.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, takes a little while to get use to it but once you do you would never be without it!!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought 2 of these in the last 2 months, and after&lt;br /&gt; about 6 weeks they wont /cant charge anymore DONT&lt;br /&gt;WASTE YOUR MONEY THEY ARE AWFUL</li>
    <li> I use the Waterpik waterflosser every day and it is up to my expectations. It is a very good product.</li>
    <li> We almost didnt purchase this due to the negative reviews. But so glad we did. It works great. If you have alot of pressure washing to do then you might need to fill up the reservior twice. Has just the rightamount of pressure. We love it.</li>
    <li> Hard to fill and does not hold enough water.&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir does not seal to the main housing and is very difficult to remove for cleaning. Water carrying the debris out during use collects between the reservoir and main housing, and must be cleaned after every use.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long. Was a waste of money. Not convenient to travel with. It was also a bit bulky.</li>
    <li> great alternative to flossing...i only use a few times a week because i forget...its better to use daily though...i typically charge on a weekly basis after using it 7 days straight</li>
    <li> Works amazing for 3 months. Really makes a huge difference for me. Then the battery just turns to crap. If I don&#x27;t leave it charged overnight, it doesn&#x27;t work. Even when I do, there is very little pressure. This is my 2nd one too...both did the same thing. I&#x27;m going to purchase my next Waterpik from Costco so I can return it easily if this happens again. I&#x27;m SOL with this purchase. Growing more and more tired of Amazon products with bad quality.</li>
    <li> I have had my Waterpik for at least 4 years. It finally no longer will hold a charge but I feel like I got my moneys worth. Planning on purchasing the same thing.</li>
    <li> bought this because i got a bridge, but you still need to floss. the price was good from this site, but honestly i don&#x27;t use it that often, it has a high pressure that makes water squirt out of your mouth and like i said you still have to floss. If you have the time and want to have a freasher mouth then i guess it would be worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, I wish the design were a little bit easier to work with- easier to empty the chamber for transport, maybe a less tall design, gets knocked over very easily.  But overall great and I couldn&#x27;t imagine doing without it.</li>
    <li> i bought this for traveling but decided it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to do a good job so it  wouldn&#x27;t be worth carrying along on a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it needs to be filled at least three times during the cleaning. I could easily do without this.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Worked better than I expected.  The battery was even charged when I received it, so I was able to use it right away.  Also, very simple to operate.</li>
    <li> This was my second unit.  First one died after about nine months usage.&lt;br /&gt;PRO:  Not as pricey as all the other flossers.  Compact...does not take up too much space.&lt;br /&gt;CON:  Water reservoir too small.  Needs to refill several times for a thorough cleaning.</li>
    <li> The rechargeable feature makes this item pay for itself.</li>
    <li> What a great product!  I floss with thread at night and with water in the morning while taking my shower.  The product works.  The charges are long in duration, it works as it should each and every time, and the best thing is it can go into the shower with me.  My teeth and gums feel great and now can keep money in my wallet as it will not go to the dentist.  The Waterpik has made me an anti-dentite and I am loving it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in November 2012 for a Christmas present  this product did not last 6 months then it started sputtering!!! Electrical plug insert turns green? Can not hold charge or be recharged ?  Replacement policy is not long enough to cover product.</li>
    <li> Outstanding device, keeps your gums healthy while you travel, or at home if you prefer a more portable Waterpik without the cord. My gums and teeth don&#x27;t hurt anymore since using the Waterpik. Best investment you can make for your mouth!:)</li>
    <li> Battery died after one year, otherwise no complaints.</li>
    <li> Nobody thought about how to get this tall unit under a short spigot. Huh.</li>
    <li> The waterpik flosser does the job intended very well.  It is easy to use, and well designed.  One the battery is charged, it holds the charge for several days.  However, the manufacturing quality is less than perfect.  The lid for the water compartment kept falling off.  I had to glue it on.  Otherwise I am satisfied with the product.  The price I found on Amazon was less than retail chains offer.</li>
    <li> I did not like it at first but have come to rely on it!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS LITTLE MACHINE.&lt;br /&gt; MY MOUTH FEELS SO FRESH AND CLEAN AFTER I USE IT.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;LL NEVER USE DENTAL FLOSS AGAIN!</li>
    <li> good price n gre8 product, I highly recommend buying for your dental wellness.&lt;br /&gt;Gre8 gift items for x&#x27;mas or b&#x27;day.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a week now and like it.The quantity of water in the tank is sufficient for one use. It also fits nicely in your hand. I recharged it once.  One drawback: I wish the stream of water  could be a little stronger.</li>
    <li> fits well in a suitcase or carry on bag.&lt;br /&gt;does not take up much room...&lt;br /&gt;u no longer have an excuse to not water pic when up travel- take this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it at home and away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;since I am not a flosser, i just can&#x27;t floss.... this helps I use it before bed every night or most nights.. before brushing,,&lt;br /&gt;it gets food out that may otherwise stay in there.... such as popcorn kernals, black pepper, etc.. that I didn&#x27;t even know or could feel were stuck in between my teeth..</li>
    <li> lo recomiendo por ser algo muy practico,liviano y facil de manejar, para mantener la higiene dental y puede ser usado por  varios miembros de la familia.</li>
    <li> Heavy, awkward, not suitable for travel.  Hasn&#x27;t been out of my closet since bought it.  I do not like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with all my books. It&#x27;&#x27;s good to be able to borrow from the Kindle owners library. My other purchases are all working as advertised.</li>
    <li> This unit worked great for six weeks.  Then it acted like it had a jam in the pump.  I could hear the pump try to start, but the motor would not run.  After I made sure the charger was working, and that I had charged it enough I tried it again.  Now the motor runs, but the pump does not work.</li>
    <li> This gets stuff out from between my teeth even after I&#x27;ve flossed repeatedly.  Like the convenience of its portability, too.</li>
    <li> this waterflosser workes great. I would reccomend this product.to anyone.It leaves your mouth feeling clean.if any food is left it removes it</li>
    <li> I still need to use dental floss to get the stuck veg in between my teeths. other than that, It&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Same complaint as everyone else! The battery dies too early.  My wife and I each purchased one.  Now looking for something else.</li>
    <li> Lasted a while. Now, after 3 months, the system has jammed. Still trying to repair. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my father at the suggestion of his dentist who wanted several hundred dollars for the exact dordless water pik.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and not much to do. It works!&lt;br /&gt;It is not as strong as a normal Waterpik, but it will clean the debris away.&lt;br /&gt;The dentist said that this one would work make my gums better. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Simply love this waterpik very much! handy and very useful and also very easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;You guys should try!</li>
    <li> Battery won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than two days. Have to plug charger in after every use. VERY dissapointed!!</li>
    <li> great product to have to help clean teeth better than floss &amp; picks. Have enjoyed the portable on better than the large unit have still</li>
    <li> I live it. It&#x27;s perfect for my teeth. I can use like every time I brush my teeth. It&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> This device just isn&#x27;t worth buying.  The reservoir is too small requiring multiple fills per use.  The device must be held vertical to empty the reservoir.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to have the battery problems that others describe, but I&#x27;m buying a non portable model and relegating this one to the \\&quot;I should have read the reviews more carefully before buying\\&quot; list.</li>
    <li> I have one of the big ones and thought I would get something for traveling. Well I used it in one of the bathrooms that I&lt;br /&gt;am in more and I can say the water pressure really sucks. I guess I am use to the bigger one with great cleaning and water pressure.&lt;br /&gt;I should have gone with something else or forgot it but maybe it will do for the travel part but for home I will stick with my big model.</li>
    <li> It will suffice, but I am a little disappointed I the pressure.  I bought it as a travel water pick &amp; it will work.  Not worth the price paid</li>
    <li> This is a highly-proactive and more convenient to use than floss.&lt;br /&gt;it only takes 4-5 seconds to fully fill its tank with water.&lt;br /&gt;no more pressure down between your teeth or possible cut of your gum anymore.&lt;br /&gt;you won&#x27;t ran out of it like a floss and don&#x27;t need to go to a pharmacy in the middle of the night when your your so tired and ready to go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;it already include installed rechargeable battery inside which will last about 3-4 weeks (depends on your time usage), and takes 3-4 hour to get fully charged.</li>
    <li> My first unit lost it&#x27;s charge after about 3 months.  When I called about the warranty they said that it was probably due to me not charging it properly but they backed down when I berated them for calling me stupid instead of asking me how I charged it and used it. They were actually even nicer than that and were already planning to send me a new one cost-free. The new one has lasted about 5 years, 2 of which were in a box unused.  I&#x27;m now using it daily again as I have \\&quot;pork traps\\&quot; in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- as powerful as a plug in&lt;br /&gt;- large-enough reservoir&lt;br /&gt;- 2 tips (4 for me!)&lt;br /&gt;- charge lasts about 2 weeks still after 5 years&lt;br /&gt;- mfg. responded to the warranty and sent a new unit instead of just a coupon&lt;br /&gt;- head swivels to help with rear teeth&lt;br /&gt;- get to see lots of junk coming out&lt;br /&gt;- easy to add mouthwash or hydrogen peroxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- dodgy initial quality control&lt;br /&gt;- can get dirty&lt;br /&gt;- can&#x27;t manually swap out rechargeable batteries (though I may saw it apart and do so after these run out)&lt;br /&gt;- not a replacement for flossing</li>
    <li> I puchased this itrem because I have gingivitis.  In a little over 3 months of using this my gums have improved immmensely.  I will continue to use this.  It holds a charge for a long time</li>
    <li> The convenience is great - should have realized that it doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of water due to the size and it needs to be filled often. It does a good job and makes it easier to control gum problems.</li>
    <li> I have a water pik non-portable, but for travelling I needed a portable one.  It served my purpose.  If friends ask, I would certainly recommend it .</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I always get food out even after brushing and flossing.  I have purchased 2 after the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.  Now my second one isn&#x27;t working due to the battery won&#x27;t charge.  I didn&#x27;t get my cord wet nor do I see any corrosion on the cord.  I assume this is a built in defect to keep us re-purchasing the item.  Although I like this and miss using it, I won&#x27;t be purchasing another one simply because this is an avoidable defect.</li>
    <li> Still getting use to using it. Never had one before. Nice that it is so compact.</li>
    <li> The product does an excellent job but it&#x27;s life expectency is short.  I have replaced two of them after 9 months of use.</li>
    <li> works great - fast delivery - best price</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product.  It lasted 8 months and then seemed to lose power and was just &amp;#34;chugging&amp;#34; along.  I kept thinking maybe I wasn&#x27;t charging it long enough.  Then I even changed the tip to see if that would help but to no avail.  Also the water resivoir is to small and needs to be filled twice to do a proper job.</li>
    <li> I purchase a new one every year. I used to use a plug-in type, which woke up my neighbor above. The cordless one does not make much noise, can be used anywhere.</li>
    <li> Hate to sound like a broken record, due to other comments here, but this device is a toy that has never really worked up to par--a total waste of money. For years I have used the larger model, that works fine. I bought this model because I travel a lot and wanted use it at hotels. I have seen some comments saying the owner has used one for weeks without a charge, mine is lucky to last two days. The small water supply is absurd. To use it on my entire mouth, front and rear of the teeth, the reservoir has to be refilled four times. I was on the road without a computer when I bought this, wish I had read the other reviews on her first and saved the money.</li>
    <li> the best! my dentist says that this is the best thing i do for my teeth. I have deeper pockets and this really helps slow the development of bacteria under my gums</li>
    <li> This product works great. I actually used to enjoy using this product, and it does do a great job of cleaning all the germs and food particles between teeth. But, unfortunately, this product works only for a few days/weeks at most. It invariably stops working. Such a shame. If only this great product also had even decent amount of longevity. One more thing. Walmart has figured out that this product dies out quickly. Walmart refuses to sell customers an extended warranty on this product.</li>
    <li> An easy to use, effective product.</li>
    <li> Our second - this one has an improved design and should stay clean more easily.</li>
    <li> Replaced older electric Waterflosser with this cordless water flosser. Cordless flossers requires less counter space and are easier to use. It has less water capacity and must be refilled once or twice to complete flossing all teeth. This is second WP-360W in family. The older item now operates at a lower pulse rate suggesting it may be reaching the end of its useful life.</li>
    <li> It lasted about 3 months (gradually got weaker &amp; weaker) before it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge at all. I threw it out &amp; got a Panasonic Oral Irrigator which I really like.</li>
    <li> Its a good product. Use it every day. Keep it charged all the time without a problem. The warrantee is excellent if it breaks during the first year you get a replacement if you call the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Excellent way  to clean up your mouth. It is like a professional clean up without the professional cost. I highly recommended. Cheers, marco</li>
    <li> This is much better than the old one I had.  This is much easier to use and does not take up much room. The old tank style one took up too much room.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for over a year with no problems.  My wife uses one also and we are more then satisfied with it.  The portability is convenient and it&#x27;s easy to use.  Add a little salt or your favorite mouthwash with water and away you go to a clean healthy oral hygiene.  My hygienist highly recomended it.  Haven&#x27;t had any battery problems.</li>
    <li> My dental hygentist recommened this for my back teeth bc flossing every day wasn&#x27;t doing it for me.  I&#x27;ve added it to my routine and seems to be going well.  Hard to get the hand of the water going everywhere and running down your chin and arm but if it keeps my gums healthy I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
    <li> This product works quite well, but only for a short period. After that, the unit will no longer charge, and it basically dies. I am about to dispose of my 3rd unit. The first two lasted about a year, which is marginally acceptable at this price. But the 3rd one stopped working after about 3 months. The result is not only an unreliable product, but also the annoyance of wondering at each use whether it will still work properly.. Definitely not recommended.</li>
    <li> Reservoir is too small; it needs to be refilled twice for an adult mouth. This unit is too long for our bathroom sink; we have to refill it in the bathtub. Very bad design.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s compact, powerful and efficient. Ultra portable. The water dispenser isn&#x27;t very large but it&#x27;s enough. Water power pressure is astonishing.</li>
    <li> Takes a little to adjust but I like it. My dentist recommends to still floss traitionally but this is a great tool to use in the morning. Easily allows me to floss after every meal nested of just before bed</li>
    <li> my first one broke, was not brought from amazon.  like the project.  would not be with out one.  my dentist recommend this for me.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> Horrible product broken with a few months</li>
    <li> I have owned four regular Waterpik flossers all of which suffered, eventually, broken or cracked tubing near the waterpik jet handle...That&#x27;s one HUGE NEGATIVE on the regular flossers. On the TRAVELER, it is GENTLER than the regular AND WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO DAMAGE YOUR GUMS as I have probably mine with TOO MUCH PRESSURE FROM THE REGULAR FLOSSERS. Plus there is no cheap plastic tube to crack AND THEY ALL WILL.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this one holds less water but it can be used while connected to the charger so no need to disconnect. IT&lt;br /&gt;IS SMALLER IN FOOTPRINT ON YOUR SINK OR COUNTERTOP; who needs more clutter?&lt;br /&gt;In short THIS UNIT IS SAFER...DO NOT ALLOW YOUR KIDS TO USE THE REGULAR FLOSSERS! THEY CAN DO SERIOUS DAMAGE TO YOUNG GUMS...I have used these for almost 10 years and would suffer gingivitis without daily after meal use. I am LAZY on regular string flossing...no excuses...</li>
    <li> Bought this Waterpik cordless flosser to supplement the home counter Waterpik.  This one is used exclusively for travel and vacation.</li>
    <li> As several other reviewers have noted, the WP-360W works well but has an inherently bad charging system.  Not sure where the problem is, but after just 10 days of use, the unit stopped taking more than a minimal charge---enough to weakly spray water for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be a mistake, but I&#x27;ve ordered the higher-end WP product and hope that it does not have the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> My dental assistant recommended the waterpik.  I only require the basic waterpik, no extras. It works fine for what I need...and &#x27;the price is right&#x27;!!!</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of a countertop Waterpik, Model WP-60W.  I use the Cordless  Model WP-360W only when traveling, because of its greater portability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WP-60W has adequate water pressure, not nearly as much as the countertop model, but it is a pulsating pressure, which I find important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water tank on the WP-60W is small, and requires 2 - 3 refills during a session.  The rechargeable battery on my unit permitted approximately 10 refills before needing recharging.  Although the tip rotates, the entire unit must be manipulated to achieve the desired angle against ones teeth.  Occasionally, food particles would find their way to the refill cap and care needed to be taken to rinse them away to prevent their entry into the tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my first use of the unit, the motor and pumping action stopped completely.  Close investigation revealed a small speck of dirt clogging the tip, which was cleared using a small wire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous models of this product were subject to corrosion of the recharging terminals at the base of the unit.  While the terminals are still at the base, they are more visible, allowing for easier observation, prevention, and clearing of possible corrosion.</li>
    <li> It does what we wanted it to.It stulates our gums. Easy to operate.a little hard to use.Sometime it squirts all over.&lt;br /&gt;You have to learn to handle it.</li>
    <li> After it starts sputtering, I think it&#x27;s empty but there is still a lot of water left when I dump it. Which is weird. Although, I do think that one tank full of water is enough. It is kinda bulky, not awful though. I wouldn&#x27;t mind a more ergonomic design. But my gums are looking good!</li>
    <li> I love the way it works. It is very easy to pack to go places.  It is so compact and I love it.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now and the DDS  has told me that &#x27;whatever you&#x27;re doing, keep doing it!  Your gums are looking great!&#x27;  Would recommend this product to anyone and everyone for daily dental hygiene.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The last Waterpik I had split along the back seam and I had to tape it shut to use it.  I hope this one is better.Thank you.</li>
    <li> Have has different water picks that worked better. This one isn&#x27;t very powerful and you have to refill it 3 times which is annoying as hell. All in all not a product I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was completely satisfied with the product. It was delivered in a timely manner, met all of the criteria I expected and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be enjoying it for a long time.</li>
    <li> i have one of the waterpiks that attach to the shower head through a thin tube, and always thought what a waste of water to run the thing with the shower open - using like 2 gallons of water to do one cleaning. so i bought this mainly because it uses less water. it takes time to get use to the pulsing jet, but it works well and all in all i am satisfied. refilling the reservoir every time is a small price to pay for saving water!</li>
    <li> item works great, it gets all debris out from your teeth, and help rejuvenate your gums to keep them healthy</li>
