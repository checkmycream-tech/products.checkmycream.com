      <li>This is my first time buying a holographic nail polish and I am in love.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first holographic polish, and i&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>I love this polish, it&#x27;s pretty unique.</li>
      <li>and it is already opaque in one coat, but more intense in two coats.</li>
      <li>To make the holographic effect really dazzle, use a good clear topcoat over the polish.  </li>
      <li>Aside from that, it has a great formula that was opaque in one coat, although I still used two, and that has a lovely, somewhat subtle holo.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
      <li>Unique color and quite pretty.</li>
      <li>The price is great, and it arrived within a few days of my order.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s different from every angle and has nice staying-power.</li>
      <li>Hard to describe, gorgeous to wear!</li>
      <li>But to my suprise , it&#x27;s just as good as the other stuff I got ( China Glaze ) .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite, it&#x27;s lovely grass green and like magic</li>
      <li>Although the holographic effect is kinda hard to see indoors, it looks absolutely beautiful in sunlight.</li>
      <li>If you like non-traditional colors, you will love this and have no regrets.</li>
      <li>It also lasts quite a long time before chipping which is nice.</li>
      <li>It goes on extremly smooth, dries very quickly and lasts quite long, even without a basecoat.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend buying this product for true nail lovers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to try more of Nubar&#x27;s polishes.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>The holo effect is really pretty</li>
      <li>Will definitely be purchasing more from Nubar.</li>
      <li>I NEVER wear green polish on my nails, but after seeing lots of good reviews and swatches about \\&quot;RECLAIM\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  </li>
      <li>The right hand I had to touch up after 3 days , normal for me as I&#x27;m right handed .</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t chip and flake right away like most of the other holographic polishes i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>was a little disappointed after the first coat, cause it didn&#x27;t show any hologram, but after 2 coats, it&#x27;s very obvious.&lt;br /&gt;Holographic effect on this isn&#x27;t superior but great anyway, so I bought one more for backup.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore this polish.</li>
      <li>I really thought that I wasn&#x27;t going to like this color.  </li>
      <li>I saw this here on Amazon, I wanted to give it a try cause it&#x27;s so much cheaper than any others.&lt;br</li>
      <li>What really sealed the deal was, my daughter-in law  works Downtown, and had never seen anything like it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Linear holographic polishes are becoming rarer as we speak, with holographic glitter taking their place, so grab this limited edition shade while you can.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a beautiful holographic polish that applies like a dream and wears like iron, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The medium, spring time shade of green is just flat out gorgeous and the linear holographic effect is spot on.  </li>
      <li>It went on easily in one coat ( although I did two super thin coats just to be on the safe side) and dried in a flash.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick, but it goes on very smooth and creates an ever smoother finish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After looking for a replacement for my discontinued Sally Hansen Magical Nail Makeup, I decided holographic polishes were extremely hard to find</li>
      <li>work in the food business, and this polish put up a hard fight between the wear and tare of one day better than any polish I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far I have not seen a credit on my debit account</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been hunting all over for holographic polishes and so far I&#x27;ve got Layla,</li>
      <li>First of all, I have to say it isn&#x27;t as green/turquoise as it looks on the picture, but that can be fixed with a green basecoat.</li>
      <li>This holographic green is so pretty</li>
      <li>I own several other linear holographic polishes, a few by Nfu Oh, and a few by color club ( not quite as linear as this)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was informed that this polish was not available and would be credited on my card.  So far I have not seen a credit on my debit account</li>
    <li> Like many nail polish fanatics, I am in love with holographic polishes. Green was one color escaping my collection. For the price, this color is perfection. It has easy application and fairly good wear time, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. The holo is more pronounced outside, but it&#x27;s still a gorgeous color even without the holo. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really thought that I wasn&#x27;t going to like this color.  I DID like it...at lot! As a matter of fact, my husband liked it too. What really sealed the deal was, my daughter-in law  works Downtown, and had never seen anything like it.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to get her one bottle for her birthday coming in July. This  is simply a product that is up there with OPI. The color, consistency, dry-time and shine!  It&#x27;s a color that you can&#x27;t find anywhere else, except Amazon. At least I can&#x27;t find it.  Sooo, with that being said, I will be back! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of holographic nail polish Nubar&#x27;s Reclaim is going to be a perfect addition to your collection.  The medium, spring time shade of green is just flat out gorgeous and the linear holographic effect is spot on.  Nubar&#x27;s formula is superb and Reclaim&#x27;s application was flawless.  Linear holographic polishes are becoming rarer as we speak, with holographic glitter taking their place, so grab this limited edition shade while you can.  You won&#x27;t regret it, trust me!</li>
    <li> Such a pretty green color! It&#x27;s my first holographic polish, and i&#x27;m in love. I&#x27;m about to buy the rest of the Nubar holos now since i&#x27;m so impressed lol.</li>
    <li> I love this colors. It&#x27;s different from every angle and has nice staying-power. I also like the brand because they have fewer harmful chemicals than other brands of nail polish.</li>
    <li> I NEVER wear green polish on my nails, but after seeing lots of good reviews and swatches about \\&quot;RECLAIM\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  The polish goes on very smooth and the color is beautiful in the sun!! Nubar made a home run with this polish!!</li>
    <li> I really love this nailpolish. First of all, I have to say it isn&#x27;t as green/turquoise as it looks on the picture, but that can be fixed with a green basecoat. I still love it very much!  It goes on extremly smooth, dries very quickly and lasts quite long, even without a basecoat. I am really impressed with Nubar!!! The holo effect is really pretty and it is already opaque in one coat, but more intense in two coats. You can kinda \\&quot;change\\&quot; the color a bit by putting a black, blue, green or white nailpolish under it as a base.  Of all the nailpolishes I have, this has the best texture and formula.</li>
    <li> (by Porter&#x27;s wife, Raph ) PUT THIS IN YOUR CART. Seriously. Just do it. Since last summer, I have become an obsessed polish-a-holic. Upon reading a recommendation on reddit.com&#x27;s laquerista subreddit, I ordered this polish. I got it yesterday and I have to say it is absolutely gorgeous. I own several other linear holographic polishes, a few by Nfu Oh, and a few by color club ( not quite as linear as this) but this is my favorite. It went on easily in one coat ( although I did two super thin coats just to be on the safe side) and dried in a flash. The linear rainbow you got in sunlight is blinding and people will stop you to ask about your nails. Color is rich, formula is perfect, price is great. Love this polish! I will be purchasing a back up because it is limited edition. Snag it while you can!</li>
    <li> This polish is gorgeous. The colour and strong holographic effect are enhanced by it&#x27;s silky smooth, flawless formula. I had a perfect finish in one coat. And it lasted for days. I love this polish! If I could, I would take it to Vegas and marry it.     If you are looking for a beautiful holographic polish that applies like a dream and wears like iron, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> This nail polish goes on beautifully, and when it dries it has an almost microscopic holographic shimmer. Not glitter, a deep holographic shine. In the green color are overtones of rainbow. Hard to describe, gorgeous to wear! I love to catch the sunlight with my nails after I use this polish.</li>
    <li> Super unique holographic polish! It&#x27;s my new favorite, it&#x27;s lovely grass green and like magic doesn&#x27;t chip and flake right away like most of the other holographic polishes i&#x27;ve tried. it dries quickly and the brush is great!</li>
    <li> I love this polish, it&#x27;s pretty unique. The product picture does not show how beautiful this color really is. This polish has some of the strongest holographic effects I&#x27;ve ever seen and I would rank this one in quality on the same level as the OPI Designer Series holographic polishes. The color reminds me of the green shades of a peacock feather. The polish is very easy to work with, it has a good brush, the polish dries to a beautifully smooth finish and is opaque in two coats. To make the holographic effect really dazzle, use a good clear topcoat over the polish.  If you are a holographic polish lover or collector, Nubar Reclaim is a must have!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting all over for holographic polishes and so far I&#x27;ve got Layla, Nfu oh&#x27;s, China glaze and Spectra Flair from different sellers.&lt;br /&gt;They are all expensive but worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this here on Amazon, I wanted to give it a try cause it&#x27;s so much cheaper than any others.&lt;br /&gt;And BOY, it applies so smooth and opaque in 2 coats with beautiful rainbow hologram.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little disappointed after the first coat, cause it didn&#x27;t show any hologram, but after 2 coats, it&#x27;s very obvious.&lt;br /&gt;Holographic effect on this isn&#x27;t superior but great anyway, so I bought one more for backup.</li>
    <li> After looking for a replacement for my discontinued Sally Hansen Magical Nail Makeup, I decided holographic polishes were extremely hard to find and I was going to have to experiment. I chose this hoping for the best, and it turns out it&#x27;s my new favorite. Although the holographic effect is kinda hard to see indoors, it looks absolutely beautiful in sunlight. I&#x27;m definitely going to try more of Nubar&#x27;s polishes.</li>
    <li> Amazing! This holographic green is so pretty I wanted to wear it everyday. I&#x27;m not much of a fan of green, but holy smokes this was a crazy color. Hopefully I don&#x27;t run out too fast, it&#x27;s in my top 5 favorite polishes of all time. I get a crazy amounts of compliments on this.</li>
    <li> Okay, I am biased as this polish is in my favorite color. Aside from that, it has a great formula that was opaque in one coat, although I still used two, and that has a lovely, somewhat subtle holo.</li>
    <li> I love this , thought it would be cheap stuff !! But to my suprise , it&#x27;s just as good as the other stuff I got ( China Glaze ) . Great color like northern lights on my finger nails ! And It last let see , I think a week on my left hand w/o touch up ( that&#x27;s with a base and top coat ) . The right hand I had to touch up after 3 days , normal for me as I&#x27;m right handed .</li>
    <li> It is just like the picture that is shown. They are shiny and rainbowy. They are vegan, they last quite long. I cannot stop staring at my nails.</li>
    <li> Buying this encompassed everything you could want from an online purchase. I recieved the item faster than the projected delivery date, and the product itself is fantastic. It goes on very smoothly, 2 coats works well and the holo is linear and very strong! I am glad I got this.</li>
    <li> Unique color and quite pretty.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this polish. The color is breathtaking, it applies like butter and was actually opaque after one coat (even though I put on more coats). I can&#x27;t recommend this polish enough. If you like non-traditional colors, you will love this and have no regrets. The price is great, and it arrived within a few days of my order.</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say at all!!! Love love love I would highly recommend buying this product for true nail lovers.</li>
    <li> This item arrived on time and as described. The color is a little darker than in the seller&#x27;s photo though. I have used it a few times now and I still like it nonetheless. It also lasts quite a long time before chipping which is nice.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying a holographic nail polish and I am in love. The glow is stunning. The color is greener than it looks in the picture. The polish went on flawless. This polish is amazing for the price. Will definitely be purchasing more from Nubar. High quality product at a nice bargain price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so elegant. The color is beautiful. The way it shimmers in the light -- It&#x27;s just stunning.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the actual polish is very good. It&#x27;s thick, but it goes on very smooth and creates an ever smoother finish.&lt;br /&gt;I work in the food business, and this polish put up a hard fight between the wear and tare of one day better than any polish I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve received a number of compliments on the actual color. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Been wanting this polish for so long! It is everything I thought it would be. I need five more words</li>
