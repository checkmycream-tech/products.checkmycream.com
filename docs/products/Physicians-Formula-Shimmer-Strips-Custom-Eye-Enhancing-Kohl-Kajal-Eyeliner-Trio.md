    <li> My wife is very happy with the product</li>
    <li> Easy to use and wear.  Just enough gleam to get noticed, but not to overpower....</li>
    <li> This product was just what I was expecting.  It was creamy, it glided on really smooth, and if worn with eye shadow, it will not smudge.  I tend to have oily eyelids, so if I wear any type of soft eyeliner I have to put a powder base down.  The brown blends in with my skin tone, so you can&#x27;t really tell I&#x27;m wearing it, but I&#x27;m sure if you had pale skin it would stand out just fine :) I like using the nude/peach color to line the bottom rim of my eyes and it really makes them POP.  I usually have sensitive skin, but this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin/eyes at all!</li>
    <li> Colors are pretty but dont stay put. The champagne one works great for a nude lipstick though.</li>
    <li> Great but breaks off too easily. I&#x27;ve gone through two eyeliners using each less than three times. They broke in my bag and made a mess.</li>
    <li> These broke after only 1 use..., I threw them away</li>
    <li> I love these liners. They look great. Walmart sells them for a couple dollars less.</li>
    <li> But the product breaks off too easy.  One color broke off after the second time I used it.  I can see a second color about to break off.  I rarely use it now.</li>
    <li> I like the eye liner. I do find that it rubs off by about noon.</li>
    <li> When I use the eye liner it broke off. Not satisfied at all.</li>
    <li> Love the way it glides on. Just wish I could have gotten only the dark color instead of having to buy two colors I did not want and won&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> Especially like the brown..easy to use</li>
    <li> This products colors are as I expected but the texture is softer, creamier, than I expected. I get sweaty? Oily? around my eyes so using this as an eyeliner didn&#x27;t work for me. It was gone in a couple of hours. Full disclosure: It&#x27;s over 90 degrees here in California now!!&lt;br /&gt;I like the light color as a great highlighter on my skin. It&#x27;s easy to apply and has a nice shimmer. I tried using the others to fill my eyebrows and that worked well. I think I&#x27;ll try them again on my eyes in the winter.</li>
    <li> Frankly not that great.&lt;br /&gt;i personally really like this brand and do try to get my hands on their products.&lt;br /&gt;what i like the most about physicians formula is that they really package their cosmetics nicely. I live the way each product is designed and made attractive.&lt;br /&gt;this trio pack was not less. They looked too cute and the picture displayed in their packaging showed some serious color. Looking at the deep color in their packaging i went ahead and bought it.. to my disappointment i didnt like it.&lt;br /&gt;it works just ok on your upper eye lid, gives a hint of shimmer too. but fails to do any real job on your lower eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It fades away almost too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;this product is not for ones who like serious heavy make up on their eyes.</li>
    <li> love them. very versatile.</li>
    <li> Broke apart the first time I used them.</li>
