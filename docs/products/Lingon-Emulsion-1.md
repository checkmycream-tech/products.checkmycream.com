      <li>It&#x27;s awesome effective!</li>
      <li>He becomes a happy child again.</li>
      <li>It is awesome to be able to spend days and nights without being tormented by an unbearable itch.</li>
      <li>your loved ones.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
      <li>I bought the product based on those good reviews.</li>
      <li>This product is very effective and safe.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s no kidding, it really is magic!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>If you have any kind of skin inflammation disease, don&#x27;t go the steroid treatment route.</li>
      <li>he’s ever been to about 75-80% better in about 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>, still the most important thing for me is that the itchiness has dissipated!</li>
      <li>steroids means you won&#x27;t get skin atrophy after prolonged usage, and in fact this works even better than them.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>works like magic...</li>
      <li>However, it has become so much better than before.</li>
      <li>Whatever you call it, it was there, and it bothers me for many years.</li>
      <li>This works even better than steroid.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many products for my psoriasis which none have worked.</li>
      <li>It worked fast for me and it smells really nice!  </li>
      <li>I noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>I am pretty sure it has some sort of steroid.</li>
      <li>Also I&#x27;m pretty sure it has alcohol.</li>
      <li>$60, it may be difficult to pull the trigger just to try if it works, but if it does (and in most cases it will), it&#x27;ll be the best purchase you&#x27;ve ever made for yourself or</li>
      <li>BUT if someone did find out the true mechanism and was able to make this medicine for much cheaper ~ that would be very lucrative!</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s been a week and his face is back to clean and smooth and he can sleep much better now.</li>
      <li>It also renews the scabby and scaly skin so that it&#x27;s soft and healthy again.</li>
      <li>Other than that, the product is good.</li>
      <li>Although, it did gave me a nice long cooling sensation</li>
      <li>Try this first.</li>
      <li>It worked like miracle at first week.</li>
      <li>Thanks for making it!</li>
      <li>This really works!</li>
      <li>We tried pretty much everything out there for our daughter&#x27;s eczema, and nothing worked like this did.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other different ways to treat my symptoms, but none worked better than this product.  </li>
      <li>My face easy get red and itch at some season, then always want to scratch it.</li>
      <li>but so far the price was worth it.</li>
      <li>After 2-3 weeks of uses, my joints are smooth and no longer red!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very helpful for the eczema.</li>
      <li>This thing worked like magic - you could see results after the first night and all the rashes are gone just after a few days.</li>
      <li>Baby sleeps much better and itches much less.</li>
      <li>My mom also has good things to say about it, but she did mention that she has to continuously use it, or else her skin problems come back in a few weeks.  </li>
      <li>But then quickly the symptom comes back.</li>
      <li>This really helps clear it up.</li>
      <li>By the end of second week, my skin was clear and felt soft and clean.</li>
      <li>If you have kids with skin condition and you are willing to buy/try anything to help them, you definitely should try this product.  </li>
      <li>And I certainly wish there were peer reviewed studies referenced on their website to back up their claims.</li>
      <li>so well, I&#x27;m surprised doctors in the US are not recommending it.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on it.</li>
      <li>This cream works wonders for my son who has had eczema(atopic dermatitis) since he was 3 months old.</li>
      <li>I used this for my daughter ( seven months old ) skin problem.</li>
      <li>The pediatrician could only recommend steroids and antibiotic creams - nothings really worked</li>
      <li>We were so surprised.  </li>
      <li>My 5 months old has eczema on his face and body and it starts oozing</li>
      <li>Nothing helped her get rid of the eczema completely.</li>
      <li>I used this product for about 3 days and the skin is almost back to normal.</li>
      <li>Then after using this one, her eczema is completely gone, now she is 11 months old, and the eczema never comes back!</li>
      <li>After using Lingon1&amp;2 for only a week, we could tell that his skin is becoming smoother, no more itchiness, and hair is starting to grow from it!  </li>
      <li>Just remember, it stings like hell if you try to apply directly on the open wounds.  </li>
      <li>Nothing helped, I tried many treatments: Benadryl, steroid creams, allergy shots, herbal medicine, it just got worse.</li>
      <li>About a year ago, my three year old son then had an outbreak of severe eczema and we took him to see various specialists and tried on different lotions that were referred to us and nothing seemed to work.  </li>
      <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve tried various moisturizing creams and lotions (Eucerine and Cetaphil, among others), as well as various prescription based cortisone creams.</li>

    <li> If you have any kind of skin inflammation disease, don&#x27;t go the steroid treatment route. Try this first. This works even better than steroid. It will sting if the inflammation is bad or if there&#x27;s an opening in the skin. But it just works wonders. We tried pretty much everything out there for our daughter&#x27;s eczema, and nothing worked like this did.</li>
    <li> I used this for my daughter ( seven months old ) skin problem. She has a red spot on her arm. It looks like eczema or rash. I used this product for about 3 days and the skin is almost back to normal.</li>
    <li> I bought the product based on those good reviews. It turns out that the emulsion does not work at all. Also I&#x27;m pretty sure it has alcohol. Do not waste your money on it.</li>
    <li> This cream works wonders for my son who has had eczema(atopic dermatitis) since he was 3 months old. I have spent a fortune in buying all kinds of creams. One cream has worked for him for 6 months.  After it stopped working, I searched like crazy for something that might work for him. I found this product and it works so well for him: no more scratching and bleeding. He becomes a happy child again. The only thing is that I have to continue using this cream. If I stop, the rashes come back. However, it has become so much better than before.</li>
    <li> It worked like miracle at first week. But then quickly the symptom comes back. I am pretty sure it has some sort of steroid. Don&#x27;t waste your money just go to Dermatologist. $60 is a steal.</li>
    <li> About a year ago, my three year old son then had an outbreak of severe eczema and we took him to see various specialists and tried on different lotions that were referred to us and nothing seemed to work.  Finally, a friend told us about this product and gave me a bottle to try it out and to my amazement my son’s condition went from worst he’s ever been to about 75-80% better in about 2 weeks.  If you have kids with skin condition and you are willing to buy/try anything to help them, you definitely should try this product.  Just remember, it stings like hell if you try to apply directly on the open wounds.  You should apply 3-5 drops with any type of lotion and that’s plenty to make a difference.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a friend. Although, it did gave me a nice long cooling sensation</li>
    <li> People with any type of skin inflammation disease needs to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;For $60, it may be difficult to pull the trigger just to try if it works, but if it does (and in most cases it will), it&#x27;ll be the best purchase you&#x27;ve ever made for yourself or your loved ones.&lt;br /&gt;No steroids means you won&#x27;t get skin atrophy after prolonged usage, and in fact this works even better than them.&lt;br /&gt;You only need to apply little bit at the time so one bottle will last anywhere from 6 to 12 months.</li>
    <li> It works!!! My newborn daughter has been suffering with ezema for 4 months. We&#x27;ve tried everything, from lotions, moistures and steroids. Nothing helped her get rid of the eczema completely. Then after using this one, her eczema is completely gone, now she is 11 months old, and the eczema never comes back! This also helped my dad&#x27;s ezema on his legs/feet too! I would like to recommend it to everyone who is suffering with eczema.</li>
    <li> My 5 months old has eczema on his face and body and it starts oozing and he is always scratching. I saw people recommend it and think I will give it a try, after trying several different cream with some improvement. This really works! In just two days his face is clearing up, and not flare up anymore. Now it&#x27;s been a week and his face is back to clean and smooth and he can sleep much better now. Thanks for making it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend, per my mom&#x27;s recommendation.  He&#x27;s had (I think) eczema on his hands and arms ever since he was a child, and scratches it every night.  He never found anything that could cure it.  After using Lingon1&amp;2 for only a week, we could tell that his skin is becoming smoother, no more itchiness, and hair is starting to grow from it!  We were so surprised.  My mom also has good things to say about it, but she did mention that she has to continuously use it, or else her skin problems come back in a few weeks.  Will probably order this combo product again for $10 off per feedback!</li>
    <li> This product is very effective and safe.  I&#x27;ve tried many other different ways to treat my symptoms, but none worked better than this product.  It worked fast for me and it smells really nice!  I would recommend this product for long term use.</li>
    <li> works like magic... i have at least 3 other friends use it for the kiddos too... and we are all amazed at how well it works... it almost makes us wonder what&#x27;s in it...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very helpful for the eczema. My boy friend has the eczema for long and after 2 weeks of use this product , the skin almost healed. It&#x27;s awesome effective!</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my son&#x27;s eczema. Nothing else would heal the itchiness but this. It also renews the scabby and scaly skin so that it&#x27;s soft and healthy again. Love it! Just wish it were less expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve battled dry skin on my elbows, knees, heels, etc for as long as I can remember and nothing worked except for expensive prescription ointments.  I was recommended the lingon emulsion which my nephew uses and calls it &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;.  He&#x27;s no kidding, it really is magic!  After about a week of using it, I can already see a noticeable difference in my skin.  After 2-3 weeks of uses, my joints are smooth and no longer red!  Thank you lingon emulsion!</li>
    <li> not worth the money-did nothing for my eczema</li>
    <li> I have eczema and have fought it for years. This really helps clear it up. It is very expensive and the bottle leaked and I lost some of it in shipping. Other than that, the product is good.</li>
    <li> My son had sever rashes. Started on the cheeks, then scabbed, then started to spread to the scalp, arms and legs. The pediatrician could only recommend steroids and antibiotic creams - nothings really worked and we were worried about the steroid side effects. We also tried Excema Therapy Aveeno and Aquaphor but those didn&#x27;t work either. This thing worked like magic - you could see results after the first night and all the rashes are gone just after a few days. Baby sleeps much better and itches much less. I&#x27;ll update the review if the rashes come back again but so far the price was worth it. Have not tried the Lingon Emulsion #2 though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works so well, I&#x27;m surprised doctors in the US are not recommending it. Hopefully there are no side effects. And I certainly wish there were peer reviewed studies referenced on their website to back up their claims. For now, it&#x27;s just blind faith. BUT if someone did find out the true mechanism and was able to make this medicine for much cheaper ~ that would be very lucrative!</li>
    <li> The best lotion we ever used for my daughter&#x27;s eczema! It&#x27;s like a miracle!!!</li>
    <li> My face easy get red and itch at some season, then always want to scratch it. My co-worker recommend used Lingon Emulsion-1, after I used Lingon Emulsion-1 few day, all the red &amp; itch have been solve.</li>
    <li> I recently bought Lingon Emulsion as a shot in the dark. I have very dry and sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve tried various moisturizing creams and lotions (Eucerine and Cetaphil, among others), as well as various prescription based cortisone creams. Unfortunately, they all had limited effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks of use, I&#x27;m starting to become a believer. It is awesome to be able to spend days and nights without being tormented by an unbearable itch. My skin has been getting smoother (still red though), still the most important thing for me is that the itchiness has dissipated! Here&#x27;s hoping that it stays that way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many products for my psoriasis which none have worked. Lingon Emulsion 1 &amp; 2 have worked wonders on my skin, literally you cannot tell where the affected areas were. Truly a miracle in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I have skin problem for at least 5 years. They call it: eczema, skin allergy, chronic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and neurological dermatitis. Whatever you call it, it was there, and it bothers me for many years. Nothing helped, I tried many treatments: Benadryl, steroid creams, allergy shots, herbal medicine, it just got worse. Until I found Lingon, I used Lingon Emulsion-1 and 2, after 5 days I noticed a huge difference in my skin. The itchy rash and cracked skin were gone. By the end of second week, my skin was clear and felt soft and clean.</li>
