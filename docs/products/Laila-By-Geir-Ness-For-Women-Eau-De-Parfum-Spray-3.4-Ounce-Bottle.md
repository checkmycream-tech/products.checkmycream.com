<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product received! Thanks a lot UPS!</li>
    <li> My daughter was introduced to this product and raved about it, but could not find it in the local market. I found it at Amazon and purchased it for her.  This is the second time and she was thrilled to receive it.  From her comments and reactions, it has to be great.</li>
    <li> smells so beautiful..wish the world can smell like this!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I first got this in Epcot Disney. I love, love love this scent.  It has become my signature. Other people love it, too</li>
    <li> Like most everyone else on here, I discovered this perfume while in the Norway section of Epcot. I put the tester on one morning and realized that at bedtime I could still smell it. All during the day I would stop and think something smells so good and it would be me! I decided it was too pricey though and didn&#x27;t buy it while we were there. When we got home I really really wanted it and decided to check for it on amazon. I was pleased to find it and immediately bought it. Now I wear it everyday. It smells classy!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell the same as what I bought when I was at Disney World.  It still smells good but just doesn&#x27;t seem as strong or last as long.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS SELLER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just received my bottle of perfume, I was running low on the bottle of Laila I already have. First, the bottle looks very different than the one I have (which I bought at Nordstrom). The bottle spilled in shipping, so it was only about 2/3 full. Also, it smells like rubbing alcohol - this cannot be Laila perfume. It looks different, it smells different - and worst of all - I cannot return it because I now see that Amazon will not accept the return of \\&quot;Hazardous materials\\&quot;. Interesting, as they had no problems shipping Hazardous materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was going to pass off fake perfume, this is exactly how I would \\&quot;sell\\&quot; it. Nice scam. Wish I&#x27;d thought of that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been scammed out of $62.31. Please don&#x27;t be scammed as I have been... Run the other way...</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister, she absolutely loves it, this is her second bottle from Amazon</li>
    <li> Laila has a light yet distinctive fragrance.  If you are of Scandinavian descent you owe it to yourself to try &#x27;Laila\\&quot;.  It reminds me of the wildflowers of the Norwegian mountainside.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely fragrance that I had purchased while in Disney World but at a much higher price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is concentrated. Only used a tiny bit and it still smelt overpowering. Does last forever but unfortunately this perfume gave me a horrible headache.  Will not use again.</li>
    <li> This smells so good...smell this first at Disney world...amazon was the only place we found it....It came pretty fast and the price was pretty much the same...Really nice womanly smell...</li>
    <li> My mom wanted this perfume for Mother&#x27;s Day, and my sister and I bought it for her. The smell is so refreshing and lasts all day long. She loves it!!</li>
    <li> The spray arrived when expected and the fragrance is lovely!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this product.  I bought essence of Norway in Disney a few years ago and loved it.  I should have known with the price tag that this was not the real stuff.  Initially it smells the same but the fragrance nearly disappears within minutes. The real product stayed with you all day and I constantly received compliments.  This stuff...no go. Don&#x27;t waste your money... get the real stuff.  Bottle looks completely different as well.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what it says it was. Smells exactly like Laila from the old bottles.</li>
    <li> Elegant fragrance! Everyone stops me and asks what it is! Best ever!</li>
    <li> This is sold in the &amp;#34;Norway&amp;#34; portion of Epcot at Disneyland....I ran out so I looked on amazon, and voila! This is the real deal.  It&#x27;s a great light fresh scent that I can wear everyday.  Lots of compliments too.  Glad I found it here.</li>
    <li> Met all expectations, as described, value priced, fast ship. A favorite for years, Laila by Geir Ness is a classic fragrance and a perfect addition to a woman&#x27;s perfume collection.</li>
    <li> This perfume is very clean and fresh and is not overpowering and cloying like other perfumes. It has lasting power and makes me feel like a girly girl.</li>
    <li> We ordered this as a gift for our daughter in law after buying it at Epcot for myself and our daughter. The scent is light enough for work yet lingers for the majority of my day. We had never heard of this until we had visited the Norway section at Epcot.</li>
    <li> I first smelled this perfume at the Norway store in Epcott.  It smells so fresh and clean.  Not the least bit overpowering.  Everyone seems to enjoy smelling it.  The price is reasonable and the scent stays on for along time.  It does not dissipate like others after a few hours.</li>
    <li> This perfume has such a fresh and clean smell. It lasts a very long time and this is coming from a person who has a tough time with perfumes staying on my skin because the scent leaves quickly. Laila definitely has an elegant air to it.</li>
    <li> Love love love this scent.</li>
    <li> Besides agreeing with what the other reviewers have said about the wonderful, light scent, I have another bit of praise to add for Laila. Most perfume gives me a headache within a few minutes of application. I&#x27;ve worn Laila for years and have never gotten a headache from it once. I don&#x27;t know if \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; is the right word, but that&#x27;s the way it works for me.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it after visiting Epcot center Norway and finding it on Amazon made her day.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. We first discovered it during a visit to Epcot, I believe it was at Norway&#x27;s exhibition. It was a birthday gift and she was really happy with the surprise.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY fragrance that does not shift when I wear it.  The scent stays true all day long.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Laila for years and always get compliments on it.  Very few people are aware of it so no one else smells as good as I do!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling perfume that I have used for many years now. Not heavy smelling or flowery. a light fragrance. Love it</li>
    <li> Such a pretty clean scent</li>
    <li> Loves this fresh scent!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this perfume anywhere except online.  My supervisor wore it to work one day and I just loved it!  Would like to get my hands on a bottle that someone doesn&#x27;t want.  If you bought this perfume and don&#x27;t like it, please email me.  malibuterri38@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> A Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law. She first found out about the parfum at the Norwegian Pavilion at Disney World and really liked the scent. My wife liked the scent so much that I ordered a second bottle. You do not need to use a lot of this perfume to obtain a lasting result.</li>
    <li> I worn this perfume many years ago; I was so happy to find it again. I get a lot of compliments every time I wear it. Great product at a competitive price.</li>
    <li> I first saw this perfume at Epcot over a year ago. It has wonderful light scent.I&#x60;ve been wearing it everday since it arrived. The scent stays with you and does not vanish quickly as some other fragrances do.  A lovely fragrance..</li>
    <li> I was uneasy ordering liquid that could break in the shipping process but they quickly put my mind at ease. It came in perfect condition, like I just picked it up from the store. It was so nicely packaged that there was no way it could have been damaged. And it came very quickly! Wonderful experience with a great seller!</li>
    <li> Special gift for my wife, she loves it</li>
    <li> This perfume is perfect for those women that cannot stand a strong scent, this is very light and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Got here quickly and smells great.  Not too strong.  It&#x27;s just right.  I will buy more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> We were at Disney Epcot in 2011 and went into the country of Norway.  When we came out my husband said I love the smell of that store.  He said there was parfum in there that he wanted me to get.  I told him we would come back and get it. (Which we never did)  When we got home I googled the parfum in the Norway store at Epcot and this is what came up.  I ordered it and I love it.  A little goes a long way!!  I don&#x27;t use every day I switch around.  Glad I bought it!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! I first found it at Disney World&#x27;s Epcot in Norway.  It wears great and was created for allergy sufferers.</li>
    <li> We first smelled this perfume at Epcot in WDW in Norway over Thanksgiving..my 17 yr old daughter loved the scent so I&lt;br /&gt;ordered her some for Christmas!  Amazon had a better price than WDW also!</li>
    <li> I got just what I expected.</li>
    <li> great item not cheap imitation</li>
    <li> I did not like this perfume at all. It gave me a vomiting sensation. And I think its my mistake to buy this based on reviews without trying it. Lesson learned - never buy fragrances without trying. Everybody&#x27;s taste is different so try before you buy :). And the worst part is I cannot even return it to Amazon back because of their fragrances return policy.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume it was packaged good to thank you!!!! :)</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a signature scent for years. This is it. It smells like the aunt at family picnics who would hug you and smell impossibly good. The scent dries down well, even in hot weather.</li>
    <li> I loved Laila perfume I bought in Disney few years ago. However, this bottle is awful. I don&#x27;t know if it is fake or......Just DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this perfume. Always get compliments for its clean fresh smell.</li>
    <li> The only thing wrong with Laila is .. I use it up too quickly because I love it so much!! No one ever says it&#x27;s too strong. I always ask because people come up to me to ask what the fragrance is.. Just last night at a Kevin Costner concert, a girl asked what is that fragrance???  My good friend also wears it, and she doesn&#x27;t want me telling anyone the name of it!!</li>
    <li> The package arrived not sealed and the box was dirty. The top (lid) to the Eau De Parfum bottle is not secure (loose) and slips off. And once the lid is removed and you press down to spray the nozzle moves loosely and you is difficult to direct the nozzle and spray where intended.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, we were on vacation in disney world, she saw it, liked it, but didnt like the price, came on here, had a great price, she loves it, I really like the smell, and one squirt really goes along way, when she runs out, I&#x27;m buying her more!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. This has been her signature scent for years. She ran out. I thought I&#x27;d use my Amazon Prime account and save a few on shipping. What I got was something verrrrry different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laila is clear. I got some yellow junk in a bottle with flowers on it. None of her bottles have ever had flowers on them. It smells like soap and bug spray. Even when it&#x27;s been on for a while and had a chance to settle, it STINKS!! She can&#x27;t wear whatever this is. The smell gives her a headache and makes her choke. It doesn&#x27;t smell ANYTHING like Laila. So, either this is fake or this particular bottle is so old that it&#x27;s turned rancid. Aaaaannnnd of course, you can&#x27;t return it. HOWEVER, I did go on to Amazon Live Chat and explained to the person on the other end that the perfume was yellow and supposed to be clear, indicating an aged product, and they did give me a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I THOUGHT I was buying this from Amazon. That&#x27;s what the listing says \\&quot;Sold by Amazon LLC\\&quot; but when I click the link in My Orders, it takes me to this page, with a completely different name on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it from Nordstrom or pay the extra $10 and buy it direct from the Geir Ness website. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON.</li>
    <li> was very nice, me being the husband likes it but my wife has allergies and they started kicking in so can&#x27;t use now...sorry</li>
    <li> Love it and finally I could get it sent to Puerto Rico, I had tried many times and it always said it could not be shipped here. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Laila is my all time favorite fragrance.  Only available in some Nordstrom stores.  Thrilled to find it online and at a discounted price.  It was shipped right away and arrived quickly and in the same packaging I&#x27;m familiar with at Nordstrom&#x27;s dept. stores.  It&#x27;s a beautiful, soft fragrance good for everyday.  Always get compliments.</li>
    <li> Its big and will last a long time. Its worth the price</li>
    <li> I Love the smell of this perfume but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long.</li>
    <li> The # 1 fragrance in the WORLD! I will never wear anything else.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before making my purchase and I will say most were spot on! This is a lovely scent. I love fresh floral scents and this does not disappoint. If you would like to try something different and love to smell fabulous - try this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my order quickly and without problems as noted by some purchasers.</li>
    <li> This was a gift from my husband, and I really like it.</li>
    <li> I have been loyal to Laila for over 10 years now. Its crisp, clean scent goes well with my PHD and lasts a long time on my skin.</li>
    <li> We found this perfume several years back at Disney in Florida. When she wears it it never fails that someone always comments on how much they like it and write down the name of the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have ordered it several times a year for my wife both through Amazon and direct form the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best price hands down but you can not overnight the perfume via airfreight the airlines class it as a Hazmat.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance!!!! Highly recommend to anyone wanting a light  and sensual fragrance for any time of day or night.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Smells refreshing not over powering, smells like summer.</li>
    <li> Happy Amazon is selling this perfume.  I purchased at Nordstrom&#x27;s a few years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it since then.  I</li>
    <li> We first smelled this fragrance in the Norway pavilion in EPCOT.  Fell in love with it.  I bought it on Amazon for my wife, and now we take Norway with us every day.</li>
    <li> Laila is my favorite perfume. I first got it at the Epcot and this is my third bottle. I got to meet Geir Ness and he is a wonderful person.  The scent is light and fresh and I get lots of compliments on it. My daughter is allergic to many perfumes, but she can wear this one.</li>
    <li> Ever since going to Epcot and finding this I have been in love with the scent. It is exactly what I have been looking for for so long.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this smell , she found this at Disney, I finally found it on Amazon</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff, not too strong, but not like a wear off body spray either. Good find!</li>
    <li> A very pleasant fragrance that is not typically available in most stores. I first found this in a boutique in Disney World, Florida, and my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Smells beautiful.  Exceeded expectations.  Lasts all day!!! The best smelling perfume I&#x27;ve owned.  I recommend it highly to all who love perfume.</li>
    <li> I first found this fragrance at Epcot and bought it for my wife. I have bought it for her ever since from amazon and am quite pleased. I will continue to buy it here for reasons of fast delivery and it&#x27;s the real deal. This will be my wife&#x27;s forever fragrance!</li>
    <li> Got my product quickly and I love the light summer floral scent.  Got my product quickly and I love the light summer floral scent.  Got my product quickly and I love the light summer floral scent.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume since i smelled it at Epcot for the first time.</li>
    <li> The first time my mom smelled this perfume she fell in love so forever I had to remember the name. She smelled it in EPCOT in Norway, and since then she wanted it. I&#x27;m glad it came just as it was all the way over there and it even came early enough for her birthday I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Great got this for my wife for her birthday, she buys this every time we go to Disneyworld at the Norway store in Epcot.</li>
    <li> I, like the others, first bought this perfume in Norway at Epcot.  Geir Ness was there and gave me a free hand massage with the lotion that goes along with this scent.  I was in love the moment I first smelled Laila.  I asked him if it was pronounced \\&quot;Lay-la\\&quot; or \\&quot;LIE-LA\\&quot;.  He said either is correct, but the perfume is named after his mother, \\&quot;LAY-LA\\&quot;.  This perfume is not an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; perfume.  It has a wonderful richness about it.  I have worn every perfume out there, and I know that everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different, but scents usually get \\&quot;lost\\&quot; on me.  Laila is the only perfume I&#x27;ve ever worn that I get compliments on EVERY TIME I WEAR IT!  I&#x27;ve worn Estee Lauder perfumes, Dior, Clinique, DKNY, just to name a few, but Geir Ness&#x27; perfume wins my heart every time.      If you like really light, sweet scents, this is not for you. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not heavy and overpowering at ALL.  But this is not something you wear to blend in, it&#x27;s what you wear to stand OUT!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife. Very nice fragrance. She likes it and so do I.&lt;br /&gt;It is different and is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> A very special fragrance!</li>
    <li> Good price and fast shipping. One of my favorite perfumes and getting harder and harder to find. So I am happy to have it.</li>
    <li> I was in epcot visiting Norway whenwe entered a store and it smelled so good. When I looked around I found this perfume was the reason for the delightful scent. I tried it on and the next morning still smelled it on me. I was disappointed that I didn&#x27;t purchase it when I when there, so I found it online from amazon. It was also cheaper!</li>
    <li> A good friend turned me on to this perfume. We call it the essence of Norway. I love this perfume. It is light and smells so good. We get compliments on it all the time. I found it the best price on Amazon. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the same perfume that is pumped into The Contemporary at Disney as well as Norway in Epcot. I love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I discovered this fragrance at the Norway pavilion at Rocky. I love it! I did, however, order the bigger bottle and was sent the small one instead. Very disappointed with that.</li>
    <li> Most perfumes are too strong for me and give me headaches, this has a nice scent and is not overpowering.  Have been wearing it for 2 years now!</li>
    <li> Everyone notices the amazing scent! Loved it since I first smelled it at Epcot</li>
    <li> Product arrived in great time and was exactly what we wanted. Saw this perfume in Disney&#x27;s Epcot and didn&#x27;t get a chance to get back to get it. It was great to have another option!</li>
    <li> I baught the Laila as a present for the holidays, when it came in the package smelled like the fragrance. When I opened the box the lid was lose causing the product to leak out. Not amazons fault they don&#x27;t package it but it was still alittle agrivating. Great product though, my grandmother loves it.</li>
    <li> Love this clean fresh scent!!!  Fell in LOVE with it in Disney World!!!!</li>
    <li> Wifes favorite, i scored some points.</li>
    <li> After reading such bad reviews, I&#x27;m very somewhat skeptical. Did I get fake perfume, I guess I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m very disappointed that pkg was not sealed in cellophane. Does anyone know if this should be sealed? I&#x27;m sick about spending so much and not knowing if its fake. Other reviews were correct in saying just go to Nordstrom 😕</li>
    <li> Rather difficult to find, as it&#x27;s not carried in most stores.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Much cheaper off Amazon</li>
    <li> My favorit perfume! It&#x27;s very hard to find.</li>
    <li> Went to Epcot with the family, and when we get off a ride in \\&quot;Norway\\&quot;, we walk through this shop that smells amazing. My wife samples the perfume and we both like it. So I sneak back later to buy it for her as a surprise, she loved it! Problem was I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else so I had to plan a trip to Epcot every year just to get her a new bottle. I found it online and it is great and I don&#x27;t have to go to Epcot just to buy it. Great product, no problems with the purchase!</li>
    <li> First received this perfume as a gift from Harrah&#x27;s in New Orleans. It is now my only choice of fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> Love, Love Love this perfume.</li>
    <li> It Was A Gift THey saw It At Disney World In Norway I Got It for her on AMazon A better Prize Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it!!!  We celebrated a little early this year because she&#x27;ll be working at the hospital on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  She also bought me Geir for Christmas, which I first saw when I was in Norway several years back.  (Geir is the man&#x27;s version of Laila.)  These are hands down the best and are not easy to find.</li>
    <li> I first smelled Laila at Universal Studios in Orlando.  It was in the Norway section.  I fell in love with it and bought some.  It is very hard to find so I&#x27;m SO glad I found it here.  It is expensive, but worth the money.  I get compliments every time I wear it.  It is a soft romantic smell that lasts all day.  I hope you fall in love with it too!</li>
    <li> I knew that it would be a hard find since I got my first bottle at Disney world. So was happy to locate this for Christmas</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. First purchased in Disney World, &amp; so glad I was able to purchase this through your website...so much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Great product and super packaging and delivery.  Like so many here, we looked at this at Epcot, but didn&#x27;t want tp get ripped by the &amp;#34;mouse&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The product smelled authentic and was potent enough, but the perfume it self was cloud. The oxygenation seemed to indicate that it was old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased Lailya before from a department store and the perfume was perfectly clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I met the creator Gerr Ness.He is a lovely person and shared that he created this fragrance for his mom for Mothers Day. Ahhh - what a son. It is made from natural ingredients from Norway and its clean, but light floral scent mixed with other secret ingredients native to Norway is so refreshing. I am not a floral person, but this fragrance has just the right ingredients for the unique.</li>
    <li> Like most people, I discovered this scent at Disneyworld in &amp;#34;Norway&amp;#34;. I have been using it ever since and have had many compliments on its light, but enticing scent. Not fruity, or too flowery - just right!</li>
    <li> I have given this fragrance to my daughter in law the past two Christmases. She loves it!  The process for ordering, tracking receiving the product was seamless and timely. Would absolutely recommend.</li>
    <li> Divine and decent price</li>
    <li> My favorite scent.  Glad it&#x27;s still available.</li>
    <li> Lovely, light, floral...different than the usual department store fragrances that are so strong. I receive many compliments on it.  Reminds me of all the beautifully fragrant women we passed in the streets in Europe...unique, subtle, elegant.</li>
    <li> This eau de parfum spray it&#x27;s amazing. I bought to my Wise and She loved it. It&#x27;s a very good relation between cost. and benefit. I recommend for a gift.</li>
    <li> Still one of my favorites</li>
    <li> My wife loved this perfume from the first time she tried at the Norway Pavillion at Epcot.  She wears it every day.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my wife.  I can&#x27;t get enough of this smell.  All she has to do is wear this and it is over.</li>
    <li> I love Laila. This has become my favorite fragrance since I first tested it in Epcot at Walt Disney world in 2007,</li>
    <li> Fresh, subtle scent that lasts all day, never overwhelming or too potent!  And, my favorite for at least 10 years!</li>
    <li> Was happy to find this scent without having to fly back to Disneyworld, not that I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy that.  It is a bit pricey though.</li>
    <li> I love the perfume and I bought it for my wife a few days ago. It arrived in time, but to our surprise when she tried it on, the bottle leaked at the top and she got perfume all over. I don&#x27;t know if this is due to careless packing or an issue with the bottle itself</li>
    <li> Love it I have been wearing this for over 8 years.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is a mega product!</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for years.  I have ordered before through Amazon, but this was the first time it did not smell like Laila.  The bottle was different, but I thought perhaps it was new packaging.  There was a hint of the Laila smell, but clearly not the same.  Even my husband noticed.</li>
    <li> I like the scent a lot, but fragrance does not last long.</li>
    <li> Smelled this at DIsneY WOrld and my wife loved it. much cheaper here!</li>
    <li> This perfume is my absolute favorite of my wife&#x27;s collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever walked through the shop in Norway at EPCOT, wondering what that great feminine scent is, you&#x27;ve found it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas because we happen to be Disney fanatics however the scent of this perfume is one of the most incredible smells I&#x27;ve ever experienced I love it and I absolutely recommend it for anyone whos a Disney fan or not</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance for over 10 years now.  I get many compliments on it and it&#x27;s light, sweet, fresh fragrance NEVER gives me a headache and cheers me up when I first put it on.  My husband absolutely loves it and needless to say, it is my signature scent.</li>
    <li> Recieved intime for Christmas, all was great with whole purchase.  They should remove word requirements, this will stop me from rating purchases.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves the fragrance of this spray.  She receives numerous compliments each time she wears the Laila Parfum Spray.</li>
    <li> I first saw and smelled Laila in Epcot, Orlando. In the Norway part. And i instantly fell in love with it. But unfortunately couldnt buy at that time even though it had a reasonable price same as here. So i bought it in Amazon when i was back home and i simply loved it! Im so glad Amazon had it! It smells magically! Its the smell you imagine every wonderful creature of mitology would smell like, elfs, etc! Its magical! You should definitely get it! It is someone similar to Issey Miyake but better.</li>
    <li> Wife loves the perfume, always has since the first purchase 6+ years ago. Unique floral scent. Way to go Norway!</li>
    <li> Best cologne &amp;#34;on earth&amp;#34;. Shipped fast and safely!</li>
    <li> I bought Laila from Fragrance Net back in February.  My husband had bought it for me before and it was wonderful. However, the bottle I received in Feb. was NOT the same fragrance at all. Even the box containing it was all banged up.  Today I ordered it from a different company. I sure hope I don&#x27;t get duped again!</li>
    <li> Product was as expected. My wife loves the scent of this perfume so much! I love it too. Nice and light. Yet stays on for hours.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing fragrance; not strong or overpowering, yet a pure, light, perfect aroma that is pleasing.  Plus, the price here is much cheaper than the store at Disney&#x27;s Epcot Center!</li>
    <li> I have used this exclusively since purchasing first in Norway!  Ligt scent and very easy on other people&#x27;s nose.  Will prchase again.</li>
    <li> Shared a bottle with mom and kept one for me. Fresh, light &amp; lovely. Mom was thrilled...and agreed it was a wear anytime fragrance.</li>
    <li> way too many compliments...lol</li>
    <li> My wife has worn this for years, since a trip to Epcot. It has a subtle fragrance and  is my favorite</li>
    <li> sorry - it was a requested gift - I have no opinion but assume that it was the choice of receiver</li>
    <li> A most beautiful fragrance!  I enjoy wearing it and I enjoy getting complements for smelling so nice.  A great experience.</li>
    <li> There is no way to describe the smell of this perfume. I simply LOVE it and don&#x27;t buy anything else since I found several years ago! I originally bought my first bottle at Epcot in the Norway area (and paid an arm and leg for it). Since I wasn&#x27;t going back to Epcot just to purchase perfume, I decided to look on Amazon for it and was SO happy when I found it. It has subtle hints of flowers that are only grown in Norway, hence has a very delicate smell that you don&#x27;t find with other perfumes.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this perfume you should!!  It has the cleanest, freshest scent out there.  When I wear this perfume I receive compliments left and right.  The Laila shower gel and lotion are wonderful.  There is candle too.  I enjoy this fragrance so much that I don’t let myself run out of it.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent!  I first purchased this perfume in Epcot Center, Orlando Fl. while on vacation after testing it there.  I now buy this wonderful perfume online whenever I run low.  For such a great product the cost is reasonable and much less than other products which do not compare.  A light fragrance that when I wear it I am asked all the time &amp;#34;what are you wearing, I love the scent&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent. It&#x27;s not over powering.  It&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!  Light fragrance.  Get compliments on it all the time</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance,not very expensive for what you get!</li>
    <li> The first time she purchased this was in Disney World of all places. She told me the name and I went straight to Amazon and found it. It was a Christmas gift and she loves it. It as a very clean and fresh scent to it, I like it too.</li>
    <li> This product was first made known to me when I was at the world showcase at Epcot/Norway. It smells like nothing else. Its soft yet so there. I have received many compliments and ,of course, I was not disappointed when I received it from Amazon:-)</li>
    <li> Smells good but the scent fades away too fast on me. Could be my body&#x27;s chemistry</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume in a little Norwegian store in Minnesota for my Norwegian Mother.  My daughter loved it and wanted it for herself.  Found it at Amazon and purchased for her 16th Birthday.  Beautiful fragrance for 16 to 78!</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite! She gets complements about it all the time. I have been buying it for several years now.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product daily.  I first found it while visiting Norway.  When  in Norway I always bring this gift home for her.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS FRANGRANCE, The first time I smelled this Fragrance I fell in love with it.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully smelling perfume. Lasts a long time too!</li>
    <li> Magnificent perfume! I Like this product because really Smells so perfect  and esencilmente soft and flowers mix in beatiful bottle.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this perfume.  Found it in the Norway store in Disney World and she won&#x27;t wear any other perfume now.</li>
    <li> I first smelled this delightful scent at Epcot.  I returned to the store to find out what it was.  I haven&#x27;t had that reaction to a perfume since 1981!  I immediately sought out Laila.  This is my second bottle.  I will say that I don&#x27;t think the fragrance lasts too well, but it certainly smells heavenly while it does.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Epot years ago in the Norway section and fell in love with this!  So happy I found it!</li>
    <li> Love Laila;always had to go to Epcot for it until Nordsrtom&#x27;s started carrying it, now I get it from Amazon for anamazing price!</li>
    <li> Everything was great,a little hold up with the storm but not the companies fault.they made it right though and all was great</li>
