      <li>I like how the products combine to leave my hair clean, healthy and manageable.  </li>

      <li>And sulfate free.</li>
      <li>It was well worth it!</li>
      <li>This does a great job cleaning and conditioning long hair without leaving residue-</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>

      <li>love this shampoo and conditioner would highly recommend it</li>
      <li>the scent is fantastic - pure and earthy.  </li>
      <li>Neuma shampoo &amp; conditioner are gentle &amp; soothing to the scalp, leaving my hair smooth &amp; shiny.</li>
      <li>leaves my hair soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>It is worth the cost.</li>
      <li>A previous poster said they liked the smell.</li>
      <li>No unnecessary chemicals.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
      <li>You do not need to use much of the product.</li>
      <li>It really extends the color in my hair</li>
      <li>First shampoo to consistently work well on my naturally curly hair and sensitive scalp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for couple year very thick so don&#x27;t need much, smell good</li>

      <li>I heard great things about this line and decided to try it, even though it seemed a bit expensive.</li>
      <li>and it is sulfate free, among other things.  </li>
      <li>Very concentrated and the smell is very organic, but I color my hair red and it didn&#x27;t help the color at all.</li>
      <li>Finally a shampoo that is free of all the parabens and actually works well on my hair.</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair very soft.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I decided to use less (quarter size) than I normally would (palm size) and it was way too much!</li>
      <li>It usually frizzes and looks dry at the ends but after using this it waved nice without any dryness or frizz.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
      <li>My thick long hair is so incredibly soft and I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>A little gives such a rich lather and</li>
      <li>My hair feels thick and full of body.  </li>
      <li>I have a full &amp; thick head of hair.  </li>
      <li>This is a good shampoo and conditioner set for moisturizing your hair, but a little too expensive.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, one HUGE drawback is both my bottles (because of the poor design) have cracked and proceeded to leak all over my shower, so therefore I LOST the entire product I had left.</li>

<li> but you only have to use a dime size, as it is very thick.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure how the product would work for ethnic hair.</li>
<li> I use about a quarter coin size amount for my medium thick shoulder length hair.</li>
<li> i dont know why they make this product so expensive!!!</li>
<li> SORRY!!!!!!!!</li>

    <li> The package came opened with conditioner spilled within the plastic wrapping. The top toggle piece was opened. I can see how easy it would be for it to come undone. So I lost a little product.</li>
    <li> I love all the Neuma shampoo/conditioners.  They last a long time as well.  I only need a dime size amount in my hair (which is probably about halfway down my back) Excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo and conditioner would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I got the product in a timely manner and I love it! Great stuff! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I think my hair is less dry than it was before using these products.</li>
    <li> My thick long hair is so incredibly soft and I love this stuff! The shampoo goes a long way too, my long hair only needs a dime size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one HUGE drawback is both my bottles (because of the poor design) have cracked and proceeded to leak all over my shower, so therefore I LOST the entire product I had left. For this reason I won&#x27;t buy it again, as this is the second bottle to do this! It pays to have quality packaging!</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my hair silky and light. I have lots of hair and this helps manage it. And sulfate free.</li>
    <li> dried my hair out and I was surprised as I had bought this based on samples i received at a really wonderful hair salon</li>
    <li> I have a full &amp; thick head of hair.  Very long too, Neuma works in great in my hair and feels great.  Also feels very healthy.</li>
    <li> Love the results that I get using the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> excellent for moisture and control</li>
    <li> A little gives such a rich lather and the scent is fantastic - pure and earthy.  I like how the products combine to leave my hair clean, healthy and manageable.  This product does not strip or fade out my color.  Great product for me and the environment!</li>
    <li> First shampoo to consistently work well on my naturally curly hair and sensitive scalp.Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year now. It is worth the cost. You do not need to use much of the product. I use about a quarter coin size amount for my medium thick shoulder length hair. It always leaves my hair shiny and feeling healthy and conditioned without being greasy. I would recommend this product to anyone with hair like mine (I do not have ethnic hair). I&#x27;m not sure how the product would work for ethnic hair.</li>
    <li> i dont know why they make this product so expensive!!! it didnt make my hair manageable and Not soft and hard to style my hair plus this hair products left my hair when i get up..Bed head Mess..I WONT REBUY SORRY!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very concentrated and the smell is very organic, but I color my hair red and it didn&#x27;t help the color at all. The shampoo is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot and my hair is above my shoulders. The conditioner is the same. It will last you along time.</li>
    <li> Love all the Neuma products. If you color your hair, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for couple year very thick so don&#x27;t need much, smell good and it makes my hair very soft. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves hair feeling clean and smelling great.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels since I started using Neuma about a week ago. I don&#x27;t need to blow dry my hair or put anything in it and it lays nice and feels bouncy (but not frizzy). I just wish it smelled good. A previous poster said they liked the smell. I got the volumizing shampoo and conditioner and it smells medicinal to me. I like something with a light fresh smell.</li>
    <li> Great product! leaves my hair soft and healthy. I will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo and conditioner set for moisturizing your hair, but a little too expensive.  I have found others that do just as well for less money</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair feeling great. A friend gave me a sample for CHristmas and once that was gone I had to get more.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo/conditioner ever. I have wavy, colored, layered hair. Love it</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair has never been healthier.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! And the price is not bad either. I&#x27;ll be re-ordering them whenever I need it.</li>
    <li> the smell is like citromella candle thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t smell for long I intended to order the purple bottles and I ended up with the blue</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase all around !!!!!</li>
    <li> Neuma shampoo &amp; conditioner are gentle &amp; soothing to the scalp, leaving my hair smooth &amp; shiny. It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Finally a shampoo that is free of all the parabens and actually works well on my hair. I love both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Same as I bought in the salon for twice the price.  It really extends the color in my hair</li>
    <li> This does a great job cleaning and conditioning long hair without leaving residue- and it is sulfate free, among other things.  In the winter I can get away with only washing my hair every other day, which helps to offset the cost. Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo..  No unnecessary chemicals.  Does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Did nothing for my fried and crispy hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  My hair feels thick and full of body.  I would highly recommend this product for color treated hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I heard great things about this line and decided to try it, even though it seemed a bit expensive. It was well worth it! It smells great and lathers very luxuriously.
