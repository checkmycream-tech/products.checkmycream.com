    <li> 15 years ago, I suffered from plantar fasciitis in my left foot.  It took 18 months to clear the problem.  A few weeks ago, I was in such severe pain from plantar fasciitis in my right foot that I was walking with a cane.  Aleve was not helping much at all.  I tried 1-TDC cream for the first time after hearing about it at a medical meeting.  The results were absolutely astounding.  The reduction of pain was rapid and dramatic.  I am cautiously enthusiastic about this product, hoping I don&#x27;t have other opportunities to test its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Active ingredient is menthol.  I can get that in a much cheaper product.  Plus, it didn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
    <li> I had difficulty finding this product on Amazon every time I searched 1-TDC the EFAC cream came up.  After ordering the EFAC cream I Googled 1-TDC and found the proper product.  My husband has RA and the 1-TDC is an excellent cream that works immediately.</li>
    <li> Best muscle relaxer on the market</li>
    <li> My PT used this cream on me recently. Very pleasant fragrance. Also very effective. Thanks Amazon for making it available.</li>
    <li> this product is great it does ease the pain of my runners knee but it is my fathers he has rheumatoid arthritis and has a kidney condition so he cannot use most o.t.c pain-killers the drugs he can use for his pain can be addictive or more detrimental than good. His ankles, knees, hands, shoulders, basically anywhere there is a joint have benefitted from this cream, it only takes a small amount to cover one of those areas and the effects seem to last 6-8 hours the same as a prescription without the harmful side effects. My father and I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have R A and It works great.  It does not take much to keep you pain free through night.</li>
    <li> This product does have its value and should be used only by those for whom it was intended. The only way to learn this is to make the minor investment to help cure a number of painful ills.  In my case it couldn&#x27;t help simply because my pain was aggravated by a full knee replacement.  Those I know who have used this pain cream found some if not significant relief.</li>
    <li> This is the best pain cream I have ever used. I hurt my shoulder two years ago and tried everything I could fine to relieve the pain. 10TDC-4 did the job. It is good for temporary pain relief.</li>
    <li> I just wanted something great for achey sore muscles and so far this is really very satisfactory.  It&#x27;s a paraban free cream that has no distinctive odor.  It rubs in quickly and makes my achey muscles less achey!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this regularly but when I do it works.</li>
    <li> This product came on time and I knew before I purchased it, that I was getting a great product. I will certainly order from this source again. I have Fibromyalgia, so I have tried many different joint products for my pain. I found the TDC cream to be as (if not more) effective than a prescription Lidocaine/Prilocaine cream. Yes, this cost about $25 dollars and if I knew nothing of the product previously, I may have been hesitant to purchase. However, I truly stand by this product and it is worth every dollar + shipping cost to obtain. Really, if you suffer from back or joint or muscle pain, give it a try and use this company. I was not disappointed. A+</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Works very well to relieve muscle strain and swelling. My sports chiropractor has me using it for tendonitis, and it has always relieved the swelling.</li>
    <li> Works great on knee pain and directed.  Relief to pain worked as stated, expectations met. That is all I have to say.</li>
    <li> My masseuse gave me a bottle of this for some low back pain I was experiencing due to having a back mouse(fatty tissue build up).  It works to break down the tissue and relieves pain.  I will be buying more today!</li>
    <li> Save your money.  Does nothing but make the applied area feel cool, like most mentholated creams.  Problem is, most mentholated creams cost about $7!  Save your money and buy something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this EFAC Pain Cream for my Mom. She uses it every day and says it really works well for her deep shoulder pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LINK:  [[ASIN:B0099YWMH2 EFAC 4 oz. Pain Cream \\&quot;Parabens Free\\&quot;]]</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by my first time use of this product. Am a senior and have a great deal of foot, arch and ankle pain , this cream gave me immense relief almost immediaely.Will be reordering again ,only wish you could get larger bottles at a little better price.</li>
    <li> I dont know why I love this product.  Other people say that it really is no better than some other products that cost $5.  There is something about it that seems to work better than icy-hot (which my body cant tolerate), and capsicum gel.&lt;br /&gt;If I have a real bad injury I move to DMSO (WHICH I DO NOT RECOMMEND WITHOUT DR SUPERVISION).</li>
