      <li>Good product.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
      <li>(He got it from Wal-mart and I loved what it did to my skin.</li>
      <li>Seems fair.</li>
      <li>Nice</li>
      <li>and yes someone needs to design something for guys because we like to be clean to LOL,</li>
      <li>It makes it very easy to hold.</li>
      <li>I like this one because it just holds up better, cleans better, feels better in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>* Doesn&#x27;t rinse out well, but most don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I use it most mornings with my Axe soap.</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this product is that it has a rubber grip.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed this sponge while I had it.</li>
      <li>I love it and all of the ladies love it too</li>
      <li>Mostly my fault</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how to explain it better than that, though.</li>
      <li>After one borrow I fell in love.</li>
      <li>make sure you have a light lunch.</li>
      <li>The dual face made shower time easy breezy.</li>
      <li>Fits in 1 hand easily.</li>
      <li>Frankly for the price just by a cheap loofah somewhere else.</li>
      <li>I had liked his so much that I brought it with on a trip for us, and thought I had lost it.</li>
      <li>* Cheap.</li>
      <li>Better off with a girly loofa/puff that will actually work than this &#x27;thing&#x27; that looks like it would be good for guys but doesn&#x27;t perform the task it was intended to do.</li>
      <li>Good service, fixed issues quick</li>
      <li>This one has a nice back on it with a nice rubber grip, and the more abrasive side helps for feet and really making sure your skin is soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>have been using these tools for the past 5 years, and they feel good and give a nice clean scrub.</li>
      <li>Got this as a gift, which is the only good thing about it.  </li>
      <li>Just got out if the shower and had to give this great reviews, it is a durable little thing.</li>
      <li>I read other reviews that said it wasn&#x27;t good but could not find anything else so took a chance.</li>
      <li>Better off getting a regular $1 or $2 netted sponge.  </li>
      <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I bought my first one 2 years ago with a AXE shower soap.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more mesh, like you would see on a traditional shower tool, and the red on the front is rougher which would be good for scrubbing and such.</li>
      <li>I give it four out of five because although I love this thing, a little bit bigger would be nice.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t worry about dinner you might have a nice little desert and some wine to nibble on after sundown</li>
      <li>Arrived incredibly fast.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make any real lather.</li>
      <li>Mine is RED not blue which I thought wasn&#x27;t great since it&#x27;s pictured as blue</li>
      <li>I like this sponge better then any other one I&#x27;ve tried, but I feel there is still room for improvement..</li>
      <li>, I think it will get to most places and you can always use a bar or suds for the other places.  </li>
      <li>Works better than any other shower puff.</li>
      <li>I take a special day where I can get with a close friend or a partner and we can do a COMPLETE body scrub of each other with a nice long shower and finally a rub down with a good nourishing body lotion.</li>
      <li>The hard part or the blue area works great, the softner side leaves your skin irritated &amp; itching.</li>
      <li>will probably end up purchasing this one again when the time comes for a new one.</li>
      <li>This does exactly what it looks like it will do, on the back</li>
      <li>but it still looks great and at least it&#x27;s not hot pink ;)</li>
      <li>They can really scrub down back and your gluts and you will REALLY feel the difference when you get out of the shower</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb or hold soap and is too rough to do much of anything.</li>
      <li>Maybe, it just needs to be broken in or used 2-3 more times to not get that itching &amp; irratitating feeling on your skin.</li>
      <li>Very durable, and it seems like it will last for a very long time.</li>
      <li>I happened to find the first missing detailer</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was pink, because it&#x27;s box was pink, but it&#x27;s reddish.</li>
      <li>I only need a little bit of soap and it&#x27;ll last for cleaning my whole body.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The hard part or the blue area works great, the softner side leaves your skin irritated &amp; itching. I had one that my son gave me (He got it from Wal-mart and I loved what it did to my skin. Maybe, it just needs to be broken in or used 2-3 more times to not get that itching &amp; irratitating feeling on your skin.</li>
    <li> Not going to lie here, this cleans my balls..... I love it and all of the ladies love it too</li>
    <li> Works better than any other shower puff.</li>
    <li> Color was different then pictured.  Frankly for the price just by a cheap loofah somewhere else. The &amp;#34;abrasive&amp;#34; side is worthless and kind of annoying.</li>
    <li> I like this sponge better then any other one I&#x27;ve tried, but I feel there is still room for improvement..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cheap. About the same price as the next cheapest one you&#x27;ll find.&lt;br /&gt;* Awesome rubber grip.&lt;br /&gt;* Hard side that works well for bottoms of feet.&lt;br /&gt;* Main sponge side feels rough, like it&#x27;s actually exfoliating (opposed to other softer ones).&lt;br /&gt;* Stays together and lasts a long time (I&#x27;ve had mine for a year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t rinse out well, but most don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t lather the soap up as well as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably end up purchasing this one again when the time comes for a new one. I would recommend this for anyone in the market for a changeup from your soft/worn out sponge or washcloth.</li>
    <li> This is the type of body scrubber my boyfriend has been looking for. This is a must for all men. Very durable, and it seems like it will last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> The logo side is rough enough to almost be like one of the foot stones, the other side is just plastic loops that cleans really well. Fits in 1 hand easily. Has a stretchy hanging band. Works great.</li>
    <li> put a ton of soap on it, and after rubbing your arm there is no more soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;should be bigger cause a man is bigger than a women</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift, which is the only good thing about it.  Better off getting a regular $1 or $2 netted sponge.  The soft side is too rough and the other side is even worse.  The rubber grip just gets in the way and it doesn&#x27;t rinse out well.</li>
    <li> It doesnt lather, and is EXTREMELY hard and abrasive. I tried to break it in for a week, but used it 6 days before crying uncle.&lt;br /&gt;I now use it to scrub mineral deposits off the shower door, and it works great to that end.</li>
    <li> Arrived incredibly fast. Faster than the amazon shipped products that I ordered at the same time, the estimated delivery was 4th-9th, it&#x27;s the 3rd and I have it in hand.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m man enough to admit I&#x27;ve used all kinds of &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34; cleaning products, luffas, whatever. I like this one because it just holds up better, cleans better, feels better in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because the picture shows a blue one, which is what I wanted, and I received a red one. At first I thought it was pink, because it&#x27;s box was pink, but it&#x27;s reddish. Not stoked about the color but, oh well.</li>
    <li> My fiancee bought one of these with his Axe Pack, and I had lost my little body poof so I asked if I could borrow his. After one borrow I fell in love. It keeps it&#x27;s shape well where as other poofs and loofahs tend to fall apart. This one has a nice back on it with a nice rubber grip, and the more abrasive side helps for feet and really making sure your skin is soft and smooth. I had liked his so much that I brought it with on a trip for us, and thought I had lost it. We were both sad about it so we went to the store and bought another one! I happened to find the first missing detailer and now I have my own, yay! I won&#x27;t be going back to poofy loofah sponges again with this thing around, it does just what I want it to and doesn&#x27;t fall apart! I give it four out of five because although I love this thing, a little bit bigger would be nice.</li>
    <li> Nice.... I recommend although I do not think it is for everyone</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the picture is blue, but the one that came is red.</li>
    <li> Good product.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars, because the cloth material is rougher than i thouht.&lt;br /&gt;it should be smoother</li>
    <li> I bought my first one 2 years ago with a AXE shower soap. I still have that one and it still works. I bought a 6 pack for backups and as gifts. I have never given them to anyone that did not rave about them. This shower tool is made to scrub your skin. The scrub side is not gentle but the back side is, it like a cloth covered sponge. I use mine EVERYDAY. It is especially wonderful if you have a shower partner . They can really scrub down back and your gluts and you will REALLY feel the difference when you get out of the shower Your back will just tingle. I like to use the NIVEA men&#x27;s soaps and scrubs. I especially like the&amp;#34; NIVEA TOUCH OF RENEWAL body scrub&amp;#34;. Ever sense I discovered the AXE shower tool and the NIVEA Touch of Renewal. I take a special day where I can get with a close friend or a partner and we can do a COMPLETE body scrub of each other with a nice long shower and finally a rub down with a good nourishing body lotion. I don&#x27;t have to explain where you can go from there, do I.&lt;br /&gt;I guarantee this is the best way to keep a relationship going strong.&lt;br /&gt;I forgot something before you start this process make sure you have a light lunch. Because once you started you both will never want to leave the house for the rest of the day or night. Don&#x27;t worry about dinner you might have a nice little desert and some wine to nibble on after sundown</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make any real lather. It&#x27;s a shame. Better off with a girly loofa/puff that will actually work than this &#x27;thing&#x27; that looks like it would be good for guys but doesn&#x27;t perform the task it was intended to do.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing about this product is that it has a rubber grip. It makes it very easy to hold. The \\&quot;lather side\\&quot; is like any traditional loofa. I only need a little bit of soap and it&#x27;ll last for cleaning my whole body. However, the other side - the blue scrub side - is rather worthless. It doesn&#x27;t absorb or hold soap and is too rough to do much of anything. You&#x27;d get a similar experience if you put soap on a piece of sandpaper.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews that said it wasn&#x27;t good but could not find anything else so took a chance. Look it&#x27;s not perfect and yes someone needs to design something for guys because we like to be clean to LOL, But it does work well, looks great and I use it most mornings with my Axe soap. I find it to be a great addition to my showers.  Mine is RED not blue which I thought wasn&#x27;t great since it&#x27;s pictured as blue but it still looks great and at least it&#x27;s not hot pink ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it a try, I think it will get to most places and you can always use a bar or suds for the other places.  Hope this helps</li>
    <li> I wanted the blue one... As shown in the picture. Product description does not say anything about color so a assumed it was blue. Mostly my fault I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I noticed in my order history that they changed the picture to the red one. I gave them back one start for the change. Seems fair.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this sponge while I had it. The dual face made shower time easy breezy. Sadly, I had to get rid of it after one month because I noticed it was collecting dirt.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described. Wish I had a choice of color though.</li>
    <li> Just got out if the shower and had to give this great reviews, it is a durable little thing. I love it.</li>
    <li> This axe detailer is essential for all males. Helps get your private area, and your bottom with a hard surface that women&#x27;s scrubber can&#x27;t match to. Plus the handle is awesome. It&#x27;s made with a durable plastic material that makes it impossible to drop on the shower floor. Unfortunately, I did see these sell in the walmarts in California where my brother lives, for a cheaper price. But I don&#x27;t mind paying extra considering it&#x27;s not available where I live, but I&#x27;d defiantly check before paying a few dollars extra.</li>
    <li> Wow this thing is extremely uncomfortable to use. Feels like sandpaper on both sides; I have to try something else.</li>
    <li> It does what its suppose to, comes in a great tamper proof package like youd see in stores and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Good service, fixed issues quick</li>
    <li> My only wish were that it was a little less tight....I don&#x27;t know how to explain it better than that, though.</li>
    <li> In a world where every product needs a review, here is one for the axe shower sponge .. er, &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these tools for the past 5 years, and they feel good and give a nice clean scrub. It has two sides that are different, so it all depends on what your body likes.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it looks like it will do, on the back it&#x27;s more mesh, like you would see on a traditional shower tool, and the red on the front is rougher which would be good for scrubbing and such.</li>
