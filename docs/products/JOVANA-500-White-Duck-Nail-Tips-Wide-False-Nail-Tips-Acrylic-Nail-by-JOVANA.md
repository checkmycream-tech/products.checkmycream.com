<li> I honestly thought I was going to be disappointed again since my previous order was the worst, but these duck nail tips are fabulous.</li>
<li> Even when you cut them down in length the shape is still there, I would recommend using nail scissors (small scissors that you usually find in a nail kit).</li>
<li> There not even flared there ugly and small very poor is not worth buying these they suck!!</li>
<li> The quality isn&#x27;t bad for the price..</li>
